<DH>Honda's Pilot SUV is a serious contender in a still-hot
category</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Honda often is late to the party with new vehicles, but when it
finally shows up, its presence can elevate the quality of the crowd.</LD>
<LD>   So it was with the new Odyssey minivan and the upscale Acura MDX
crossover sport utility. Each set a new standard for its category
when introduced in the fall of 1999 as 2001 models.</LD>
<LD>   And so it will be with the Honda Pilot, a family-oriented SUV
crossover built off the same Odyssey platform as the MDX. "It is 67%
MDX," says chief program engineer Frank Paluch. The similarities are
all under the skin, which isn't a bad thing in this family of
vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   The Pilot arrives in dealer showrooms this week to replace the
Passport, an Isuzu re-badged as a Honda and found wanting by Honda
buyers. Most have stopped seriously considering the brand when
searching for an SUV bigger and more capable than the CRV.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pilot gives Honda a serious contender in the still-hot
compact SUV category. Although Honda Marketing Vice President Dan
Bonawitz says he expects most buyers to be Honda loyalists who have
been waiting for a vehicle such as the Pilot, the company also
expects to woo customers from Ford's Explorer and Toyota's
Highlander, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot is a crossover. It looks like a standard SUV but is built on
a passenger car platform and uses car-like unibody construction
rather than the body-on-frame construction of a truck. This is more
than an SUV-styled wagon, though.</TE>
<TE>   It won't traverse the Rubicon, the Lake Tahoe-area off-road route
famed for its steep rock walls and deep-carved gullies. But the Pilot
will go up steeper, muddier hills and through deeper, dirtier ditches
than 90% of today's SUV drivers are willing, or able, to tackle.</TE>
<TE>   And then, when hosed off, it will take a parent and as many as
seven kids to the mall or school or a soccer game, or cart mom and
dad and up to six of their best friends (especially if at least three
in the group are slim and under 5 feet 7 inches tall) to the
opera--grand or Grand Ole, it would be at home in either crowd.</TE>
<TE>   It also will replace that pickup dad's been lobbying for.</TE>
<TE>   With both rear and middle-row seats folded into the floor, a full
sheet of plywood will lie flat in the Pilot's cargo bay. A stack of
plywood, in fact, will fit, or a standard Southern California
backyard's worth of landscaping material or a whole lot of
skateboards, camping gear or luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Honda held the press preview of the Pilot in the rolling Blue
Ridge Mountains in and around Asheville, N.C., with an off-road
course built to show off the Pilot's capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   A single day of driving, especially in controlled circumstances,
isn't enough to tell whether a new vehicle has what it takes to
continue to please past the new-purchase honeymoon, but the Pilot at
least can point to two siblings that are doing well in that
department two years after introduction.</TE>
<TE>   And after a day of driving, on asphalt and off, I can attest that
Honda's new SUV has plenty of power, comfortable seats, a panoramic
view from inside the cabin, lots of room and a fairly rigid body with
little roll and sway even on hairpin curves.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a sports car, not even a sports sedan, but on the road
it will run with the best of the pack in the SUV-minivan-light-pickup
class.</TE>
<TE>   Off-road, it vies for class leadership. It won't outperform every
competitor at every task, but overall it works beautifully doing what
it was designed to do--get through a variety of mild-to-moderate
off-road conditions with dispatch and aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   The Pilot's agility comes from its 8-inch ground clearance, wide
and grippy P235/70R16 tires, short nose and tail overhangs and
Honda's variable torque management drive system.</TE>
<TE>   Under normal driving conditions, the Pilot operates in front-wheel
drive. When one or more wheels start slipping, it starts diverting
torque--up to 53% of it--to the rear wheels. And when the going gets
really tough, as in off-road hill climbing or bog slogging, the
driver can punch a button on the dash and lock the system into a
terrain-handling 50-50 split.</TE>
<TE>   On the minus side, a few things:</TE>
<TE>   * No one will follow you home to ask what that stunning new car is
you're driving. It is a plain-vanilla SUV.</TE>
<TE>   * The rear access hatch is a single-piece tailgate that swings up.
When the tailgate is open, the rear corners are low enough to add a
crease to the forehead of anyone much over 6 feet 2 inches who isn't
paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   * The Pilot has the same awkwardly placed steering-column-mounted
gear selection lever as the Odyssey, so if you have the standard
five-speed automatic in low gear you must reach down somewhere
between kneecap and shinbone to find the lever.</TE>
<TE>   * Shifting in the two models I drove was notchy, making it
difficult to move smoothly between forward gears or to get from park
to drive without a little effort. Most people don't manually shift an
automatic except when parking or reversing, so in a regular car the
irritation levels would be small. But this is an SUV that uses low
gear if you take it through its paces off-road. And on the road or
off, we don't expect Hondas, especially with a starting price of
$27,360, to give us even a little bit of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Just about everything else in the Pilot package is on the plus
side.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle shares its engine and drive train with the Acura MDX,
so you get a powerful 3.5-liter V-6 with 240 horsepower and 242
pound-feet of torque.</TE>
<TE>   The Honda, though, uses regular gasoline instead of premium and is
EPA-rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city and 22 mpg on the
highway.</TE>
<TE>   It will get a low-emission vehicle (LEV) rating nationally and
should get an ultra-low, or ULEV, rating in California, Paluch says.</TE>
<TE>   Its five-speed automatic transmission comes with programming that
holds it in lower gears longer when climbing hills to minimize
annoying gear-hunting. The ride is softer and the handling less
sporty than the driver-oriented MDX, but Honda figures hard-core
drivers will spring for the Acura.</TE>
<TE>   The Pilot is a family vehicle, designed to carry kids and cargo
and go off-roading and pull a medium-sized boat or small trailer--and
do it all in comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Towing capacity is 4,500 pounds, and with a body that's a bit more
than 4 inches wider than its major competitors', the Pilot beats the
stuffing out of everything in the class in cargo space: 90.3 cubic
feet with the second- and third-row seats folded, versus 80.1 cubic
feet in the new Chevy Trailblazer, 81.4 cubic feet in the Highlander
and 88 cubic feet in the Dodge Durango. Even with all seats in use,
there's still 16.1 cubic feet of storage.</TE>
<TE>   The door panels are scooped out to increase arm room and add to
the feeling of space in the cabin; the rear suspension is designed to
fit beneath the body so there's no spring or shock tower intrusion to
interfere with the rear seating or cargo area; and the interior is
packed with cup holders (nine of them) cubbyholes, map pockets and
storage spaces.</TE>
<TE>   In the high-end EX model there's a child-friendly fold-away
activity tray in the second-row seats that has two cup holders, a
storage bin for games and special compartments to hold the ketchup
and dipping-sauce containers that come with the fast-food meals the
kids demand on any drive longer than a trip to the grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   There's an optional factory-installed entertainment system with a
DVD player and flip-down 7-inch screen, a feature Honda also offers
in the Odyssey minivan.</TE>
<TE>   Rugged outdoors types might want to pass on the entertainment
package in favor of the DVD-based navigation system. It is a
satellite-linked system with a touch-control screen and provides both
audio and visual cues for the driver.</TE>
<TE>   For reasons known only to Honda's interior designers and marketing
specialists, the entertainment and navigation options can't be
combined and are available only on EX models with optional leather
upholstery.</TE>
<TE>   The most expensive combo, the Pilot EX with leather seats and the
navigation system, is $32,980, including Honda's $460 destination
charge--$5,620 more than the base LX model. The base EX is $29,730.</TE>
<TE>   Standard equipment on all models includes four-wheel, anti-lock
disc brakes; air conditioning with separate front and rear controls;
power windows and locks; cruise control and front buckets.</TE>
<TE>   On the safety side, Honda provides standard driver's and
passenger's front and side air bags and surrounds the passenger cabin
with crumple zones that help dissipate crash-impact energy.</TE>
<TE>   Special blocker brackets on the sub-frame make the Pilot "crash
compatible" with standard passenger cars and keep it from riding up
over a smaller vehicle's bumper.</TE>
<TE>   All eight seating positions have three-point belts. The center
belts are ceiling mounted and, in a typically Honda touch, retract
when not in use to provide an unobstructed cargo area.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Final Words: You owe it to yourself to test a Pilot if you are
considering a compact or mid-size SUV that will see more highway than
off-road duty. And if the Odyssey and Acura MDX are anything to go
by, don't expect to pay anything less than sticker price.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Developers of the 13,000-unit Playa Vista planned community in West
Los Angeles have contracted with DaimlerChrysler subsidiary Global
Electric Motorcars to develop a zero-emission community
transportation plan.</LD>
<LD>   The arrangement also makes GEM the exclusive retailer of low-speed
electric vehicles in the community.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, electric vehicles would be the dominant mode of
transportation. Electric trams and low-speed electric vehicles would
be used for personal trips within the community, and electric city
cars would be available on a per-trip basis for use in the region by
residents and business tenants.</LD>
<TE>   "Our residents will be able to keep their gas guzzlers in the
garage and use electric vehicles for trips within Playa Vista and
throughout the greater Southern California area," said Playa Vista
President Steve Soboroff.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta-based EMotion Mobility is providing the telematics,
management and reservation systems for the program, as well as the
electric vehicles used in the car-sharing program.</TE>
<TE>   IRS Sets New Eligibility Rules for Deductions</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has issued new guidance spelling out that hybrid
gasoline-electric vehicles such as the Honda Insight and Civic and
the Toyota Prius are eligible for the $2,000 federal clean-fuel
vehicle deduction.</TE>
<TE>   The full deduction applies to hybrids purchased between 2000 and
2003. Consumers who bought those vehicles in 2000 or 2001 must file
an amended tax return to get the deduction.</TE>
<TE>   A reduced deduction is included under current rules for hybrids
purchased from 2004 to 2006. The amount diminishes each year because
the IRS figures the number of hybrids will be increasing.</TE>
<TE>   More details are available through tax advisors or on the IRS Web
site at www.irs.gov.</TE>
<TE>   GM, Suzuki Team Up With Electrovaya</TE>
<TE>   General Motors and Suzuki Motor Co. said their joint-venture plant
in Ontario, Canada, will team up with Electrovaya Inc., a Canadian
battery maker, to develop electric vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Electrovaya, which makes lithium-ion rechargeable batteries for
laptop computers, will develop an electric propulsion system for the
Chevrolet Tracker and Suzuki Vitara twins, compact sport utility
vehicles built at the Canadian plant.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for Dodge Durango Hybrid Are Shelved</TE>
<TE>   Changing product plans at Dodge's truck division have driven a
stake through the heart of previously announced plans to build and
market a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the Dodge Durango SUV,
parent DaimlerChrysler says.</TE>
<TE>   Dodge wants to boost the size of the Durango so it can compete in
the hot, full-size sport utility market, says Jeff Schuster of J.D.
Power and Associates. The bigger platform negates the fuel savings of
a hybrid Durango.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler still intends to use its unique hybrid system in
something, and Schuster is guessing it might be the four-wheel-drive
Pacifica, a sport utility wagon coming in 2003 as an '04 model.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's hybrid system for four-wheel-drive vehicles uses a gas
engine to drive one set of wheels and an independent electric power
plant to drive the second set. A computer links the two and decides
when to add the electric power to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   In conventional two-wheel-drive hybrid systems, the electric motor
works as a supercharger to boost the output of the gasoline engine.</TE>

<HD>California Classic Event Adds Taste of Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Owners of nearly three dozen classic and exotic cars will depart
Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive on Sunday, heading for Ojai on the first
leg of a five-day jaunt meant to re-create a European touring rallye.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth annual California Classic Rallye, which will take
drivers from Los Angeles to Big Sur and home by way of the back roads
of the central California coast, will roll into town June 13 in time
for the annual Petersen Automotive Museum gala fund-raiser.</LD>
<LD>   It's all part of California Classic Week--a celebration of the
region's auto culture that will include a major sale of classic and
collectible cars by the Barrett Jackson auction house and the opening
of the "Million-Dollar Cars" exhibition at the Petersen. The week
will be capped June 16 by the fifth annual Concours on Rodeo car
show.</LD>
<TE>   The week is the result of an effort by auto enthusiasts Andy Cohen
and Jim Hull to create, as Hull puts it, "a world-class auto event in
Los Angeles, which is the car capital of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen is owner of Beverly Hills Classic Cars; Hull founded Huddle
Furniture, which made home furnishings from recycled materials, a
business he closed when he retired a few years ago. Each of them has
produced car shows in the region: Cohen did the Beverly Hills Car
Show and Hull a show in Pasadena as a fund-raiser for the city's
historical society. When Hull lost his corporate sponsor in the late
1990s, the two men decided to pool their talents.</TE>
<TE>   The result is the Concours on Rodeo, which for the day takes over
the three-block stretch of Rodeo Drive from Wilshire to Santa Monica
boulevards. Last year the event drew 60,000 spectators. Unlike
California's other major shows at Pebble Beach, Newport Beach and
Torrey Pines, the Beverly Hills concours is open to the public at no
charge.</TE>
<TE>   But Hull wasn't satisfied with just a car show. He likes to drive
and had been participating in European rallies for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do something here to get people in the mood for the
Concours on Rodeo, something that would bring in special cars from
all over the country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rules of the California Classic Rallye were drafted to
encourage participants to stick around and display their cars at the
Sunday car show. This year, he said, all 33 vehicles will be on Rodeo
Drive.</TE>
<TE>   For those who dislike big crowds or have other plans, Hull has
scheduled the rallye to begin at the civilized hour of 1:30 p.m.
instead of the usual dawn. The cars will be parked along those same
three blocks of Rodeo for public viewing from 11 a.m. until they
drive away, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cars range from a 1915 Marmon speedster brought from Englewood,
N.J., to a 2002 Maserati Spyder owned and driven by a couple from
Hidden Hills. Hull and his wife, Tonya, will be driving their 1947
Delahaye cabriolet. Cohen will be piloting a 1953 Buick Skylark. The
entry list is replete with Ferraris, Bugattis and Porsches.</TE>
<TE>   A special pair, Hull said, are the 1933 V-12 Packard convertible
being driven by Julie Reesman and the 1938 V-12 Packard sedan being
driven by her husband, retired insurance executive Bill Reesman. The
Beverly Hills couple, Hull said, bought the his-and-hers Packards so
they could participate this year in the rallye.</TE>

<HD>Inadequate Collection and Analysis of Accident Data Prove
Costly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>First of two parts</SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great shattering of automobiles across the country every year is
a complex and poorly understood puzzle that destroys more than 41,000
lives, injures 5.3 million and wrecks 28 million vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   It has been more than two decades since the federal government
began an ambitious effort to help solve the mystery surrounding
highway accidents, which carries staggering economic consequences for
the U.S., estimated in a recent report at $231 billion annually.</LD>
<LD>   Highways can be made safer only if regulators, state driver
licensing agencies, auto makers and highway designers fully
understand why accidents happen, but the knowledge of the variables
remains sketchy and incomplete.</LD>
<TE>   The inadequacies in the collection and analysis of accident data
were a large part of the reason that 270 Americans died in Ford
Explorers equipped with Firestone tires before anybody even
recognized the enormity of the defect in play. The system for
providing early warning was incapable of delivering the message.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bad," said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto
Safety in Washington. "You can't detect defects. Just take a look at
the Ford Explorer and Firestone tires. If the system were good, it
should have caught it."</TE>
<TE>   This system consists of many parts: local police who investigate
accidents, state agencies that collect data, federal statisticians
who compile massive databases and defect analysts who comb through
stacks of information seeking tiny nuggets that reveal trends.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important parts of the system is the National
Automotive Sampling System, or NASS, which investigates a sample of
5,000 crashes across the country each year.</TE>
<TE>   It is operated by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis,
part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. (The
center also oversees other databases, including the Fatal Accident
Reporting System, special crash investigations, safety belt surveys
and a system to match accidents with hospital cost data.)</TE>
<TE>   To operate NASS, the center has investigators in 24 cities across
the country who pick a sample of accidents--partly at random and
partly based on what looks interesting--that occur within their
jurisdictions. Within two to five days of some accidents, they go out
and talk to the people involved in the crashes, photograph the sites
and examine the vehicles in police impoundment lots.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose is to understand what is happening in crashes," said
Joseph Carra, director of the National Center for Statistics and
Analysis. "We can look at what is happening over time.</TE>
<TE>   "In a frontal crash, we look at the speed, whether the head hit
the visor, whether passengers were buckled or not buckled, whether
the air bag deployed. We can use that data for all sorts of research
work. We determine priorities from that."</TE>
<TE>   But what the sampling did not do, Carra acknowledged, was identify
one of the biggest defects in decades in the Ford-Firestone case.
Should it have?</TE>
<TE>   "I hesitate to answer that," he said. "It is not a simple
yes-or-no answer. To show a specific problem like Ford-Firestone from
the data is asking too much. It is very hard to notice even when you
are looking for it."</TE>
<TE>   Critics outside the agency say NASS is a shadow of what was
originally envisioned when it was launched in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Nash, adjunct professor at George Washington University and a
former federal safety regulator, said NASS was originally intended to
collect data from 18,000 crashes each year with 75 teams across the
country. When he took over the system in 1980, it had 50 teams and
was still growing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   With data from 18,000 crashes, it would have been possible to
collect information on 50 crashes for every model vehicle within the
first year of production, Nash said, providing manufacturers with "a
lot of insight before design began of the next generation of the
model."</TE>
<TE>   But in the Reagan administration's downsizing of government, NASS
was cut to 36 teams by the mid-1980s and then 24 teams by the early
1990s, Nash said. In the process, data collections dropped to just
5,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are driving blind, because we don't have enough information to
know when we have a problem like Ford-Firestone," Nash said. "It is a
national disgrace and tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ditlow, the director of the Center for Auto Safety: "The
number of cases they look into is only one-third of what everybody
agrees is a valid sample."</TE>
<TE>   Nash estimates that it would cost $20 million to get the
additional data, a small cost compared with the "$20 billion we spend
for the National Institutes of Health to investigate diseases that
don't kill any more people than die in car crashes."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the NIH operates within a medical establishment that
considers it an ally, whereas NHTSA regulates an industry that
generally regards it as an enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Carra acknowledged that NASS was originally intended to collect
more data and that the smaller database is less useful.</TE>
<TE>   "In general terms, it compromises our ability to do analysis,
because you have smaller sample size," he said. "If you do have a
problem, it takes you longer to identify it or you can't see it at
all.</TE>
<TE>   "Would we like to have more cases? Absolutely. More resources
would give us more cases."</TE>
<TE>   It costs about $10 million a year to run NASS' most important
database: the crashworthiness data system. Tripling the collections
to 15,000 cases would cost $20 million to $30 million, Carra said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if NASS collected more data, it probably could not have
identified the Ford-Firestone problem, because of other shortcomings.
Until the problem became known, NASS did not even collect data on
tire blowouts. Fortunately, that has been addressed and NASS now has
data on tire blowouts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next week, I'll examine the quality of the data flowing into the
federal government's databases from local police agencies.</TE>

<LD>The first blueberries of the summer always seem to be best, extremely
firm and tart. Those are the berries I like to cook with most. They
give a much-needed lift to all kinds of baked goods, from pies and
pancakes to muffins and cakes.</LD>
<LD>   This is also the time to freeze them, so you have them for the
rest of the year. It's not necessary to thaw frozen berries before
mixing them in a recipe, just allow a fraction longer to bake or cook
the dish. Just don't thaw them and use them raw--they become mushy as
they thaw.</LD>
<LD>   To freeze blueberries, spread them on a jellyroll pan and sort
through to discard stems and leaves and any soft or shriveled
berries. Place them in the freezer until they're hard, about 2 hours.
Pile them into a plastic food bag, seal it airtight and then enclose
that bag inside another airtight plastic bag. Give them a rinse
before using.</LD>

<HD>Mac &amp; Cheese Forever</HD>
<DH>We've loved it for centuries. Now chefs are embracing it
too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patina, that Melrose Avenue institution, has made one with
hand-rolled macaroni and mascarpone cheese. Ammo, a Hollywood spot
where you're likely to overhear conversations about personal
trainers, does a version with four cheeses and wild mushrooms. During
truffle season, Melisse in Santa Monica fills a tuile of melted
Parmesan with pasta, Taleggio and truffles.</LD>
<LD>   And when Mimosa, a French bistro on Beverly Boulevard, first put
it on the menu, they called it gratine macaroni comme quand on etait
petit.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, macaroni and cheese "like when you were little."</LD>
<TE>   Mac and cheese--it might be the last thing you'd expect to find
chefs lavishing with attention. But just look though the menus at
some of the city's most interesting restaurants and it's clear that
macaroni and cheese is the new-old thing of the moment. One chef
after another is trying a personal riff on a dish that already has a
long and storied past, putting real creative energy into it while
maintaining its endearing kid-food qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, whenever ambitious chefs try to put their mark on
something we love, some of us start to worry (here they go again).
And some of these newfangled versions are rather alarming (thanks,
but we'll pass on the version with foie gras). But there are plenty
that actually work.</TE>
<TE>   Take the one at the House on Melrose Avenue--a dish made with such
finesse that, to the chef's shock, it is helping to make the
restaurant's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "It got on our menu kind of as a joke," says Scooter Kanfer, the
chef. "When we were about to open last year, we were all stressed
out, and they asked me, 'What do you really feel like eating?' and I
said, 'Macaroni and cheese.'</TE>
<TE>   "But it's turned out to be one of my biggest sellers. I go through
30 pounds of cheese a week."</TE>
<TE>   If you're one of the legions who've tasted it, that's no surprise.
Kanfer's version--made with luscious goat's milk Cheddar, extra-large
pasta shells and a crisp layer of bread crumbs as delicate as a creme
brulee crust--is absolutely transcendent.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Peel, who sometimes serves macaroni and cheese at Campanile's
Monday-night family dinners, says a lot of the attraction is the fact
that it's a touchstone of American home cooking. "Nearly every kid
grew up eating it," he says. "I like it a lot, personally. You can
use it as a blank slate, you can do a lot of things with it, though
you have to have one foot in tradition."</TE>
<TE>   One of its secrets is versatility. Macaroni and cheese has to be
close enough to what you grew up on to warm the heart, but beyond
that there's a recipe for every taste, from simple mac and Jack to
versions spiked with bacon or chutney. It can be chewy with tender
pasta or so loaded with cheese it's more like a nacho plate. There's
room for Oprah Winfrey's recipe (Munster, Jack, two kinds of Cheddar,
Velveeta, two eggs) and Paul Prudhomme's (low-fat Cheddar and cottage
cheese).</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are some defining principles for a great one.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to use good cheese, and the sauce should just fill the
spaces, it shouldn't flow," Peel says. "And it has to be baked. The
best part is the crusty part at the top, which you don't get with a
Kraft Dinner."</TE>
<TE>   White sauce enriched with cheese is what makes it macaroni and
cheese, but pasta gives it much of its character. Many restaurants,
including Marina del Rey's soul food favorite Aunt Kizzy's Back
Porch, use larger pastas than the traditional elbow macaroni, such as
shells or rigatoni, precisely because they keep the sauce from having
a soupy feel; the sauce clings better to the broad surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   And though a lot of us have the particular mild Cheddar flavor of
the Kraft Dinner in the back of our minds somewhere, there are other
ways to go. "There are basically two schools," says Nick Coe, the
former proprietor of Nick's in South Pasadena. "The French way mixes
different cheeses. But if you're only using mild Cheddar or American
cheese, you have to add onions or something to give it some
interest."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, these are just grown-ups' tastes. A children's Web site
called Topher's Castle (www.lava surfer.com) has a feature in which
kids vote for their favorite macaroni and cheese. They clearly prefer
bland, ultra-gooey sauce, and lots of it. It's no accident that the
Kraft macaroni and cheese home page (www.kraftfoods.com/the
cheesiest/home.html) shows a smiley dinosaur surfing a yellow ocean
of cheese sauce.</TE>
<TE>   But then, mac and cheese is a dish that crosses all sorts of
demographic lines. It's so all-American that nobody thinks of it as
Italian. But it is, or at least it started that way.</TE>
<TE>   The first Italian pasta recipes showed up in the middle-1300s.
They had their oddities--the earliest lasagna recipe used leavened
dough; macaroni started out as a flat noodle rather than a hollow
tube pasta--but they were all served with cheese.</TE>
<TE>   From Italy, the idea eventually spread to France, but it actually
reached England first. The ties of the English royal family were with
Normandy, which had possessions in Italy in the 14th century, so
Richard II's cookbook, "The Forme of Cury" (1390s), had recipes for
loseyns (lasagna) and makerouns (macaroni) when they were still
unknown in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The makerouns were served with grated cheese and melted butter, so
this was not really modern macaroni and cheese but something more
like pasta Alfredo. And for nearly 500 years, it was how most pasta
was eaten.</TE>
<TE>   Not in Britain, though. After Richard II's time, the English
forgot about macaroni altogether. But in the middle 1700s, English
gentlemen started taking the grand tour of the continent to complete
their education, and some of them brought back a taste for foreign
delicacies, including caviar and macaroni.</TE>
<TE>   The most pretentious of these connoisseurs were actually nicknamed
"macaronis." They were what you might call too cool for school. One
observer said they managed to talk without meaning, smile without
pleasantry and ride without exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Jefferson picked up a taste for macaroni in Paris too, and
he went on to serve it at the White House. The version he liked,
using a stick of butter and a quarter-pound of cheese for every two
cups of dry pasta, became widely known in this country.</TE>
<TE>   But he'd learned about pasta from the French, and French have
always been notorious for overcooking it. (To be fair, the concept of
al dente took awhile to develop, even in Italy. The most influential
Italian cookbook of the late 1500s said to cook macaroni for two
hours.) So well into the 20th century Americans habitually overcooked
macaroni, and in fact all forms of pasta.</TE>
<TE>   How badly did they overcook it? Many recipes said to boil macaroni
for 45 minutes. Even more appalling, Jefferson's cousin Mary Randolph
published a recipe for making "mock macaroni" when you couldn't find,
or afford, the real thing: "Break some crackers in small pieces, soak
them in milk until they are soft; then use them as a substitute for
macaroni." All this might explain why it never occurs to anybody who
grew up in this country that macaroni and cheese should be al dente.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the rest of the 19th century, macaroni and cheese
remained pretty much as Jefferson made it, except that people had
started baking it as a casserole, so from the 1840s on, most cooks
added white sauce to the cheese for stability and sprinkled the dish
with bread crumbs for an au gratin topping. Some took to putting in
mustard, Worcestershire sauce or cayenne, the usual flavorings of
Welsh rabbit, another dish that featured melted cheese.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time. macaroni remained an expensive import, so
macaroni and cheese was a relatively fancy dish. But at the end of
the century, the price came down and macaroni became an everyday food
in this country. The stage was set for home-cook inventions such as
the potato chip crust. At last, mothers had something nearly every
kid would eat. And then in 1937, Kraft Cheese Co. fatefully
introduced the Kraft Dinner, with which, they advertised, you could
make mac and cheese in nine minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Every version reflects the taste of its times. Welsh rabbit made
its contribution to macaroni and cheese in the 19th century, and
cheese nachos are making theirs today when people reach for salsa
with their mac and cheese. Others top it with ketchup, by analogy
with the cheeseburger. Deep-dish pizza will probably give rise to
versions spiked with pepperoni, if it hasn't already.</TE>
<TE>   One thing's certain: Macaroni and cheese will live through it all.
It's a survivor.</TE>

<TE>   The House's Scooter Kanfer based this elegant dish on her
grandfather's version. Panko are Japanese bread crumbs. Redwood Hills
makes a good goat's milk Cheddar. If you can't find it, you can
substitute 21/2 cups shredded Cheddar and 1/4 cup soft goat cheese.</TE>
<TE>   2 3/4 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup butter</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>

<TE>   1 1/4 cup fresh bread crumbs or panko</TE>
<TE>   Heat the broiler or the oven to 350 degrees. Heat the milk to just
below boiling and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a saucepan. When it starts to bubble, whisk in
the flour and cook for 1 minute to make a roux. Slowly pour the
heated milk into the roux, whisking constantly, and cook until the
mixture bubbles and becomes thick, about 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove from the heat and season with the salt, pepper, allspice,
nutmeg and cayenne. Stir in the grated Cheddar, Fontina and Gruyere.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the pasta in plenty of rapidly boiling salted water slightly
less than you normally would, about 10 minutes. Stir the pasta into
the cheese sauce and divide evenly among 6 buttered ramekins.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the bread crumbs evenly among the ramekins and scatter over
top. Brown the bread crumbs under the broiler 1 to 2 minutes or in
the oven, about 30 minutes.</TE>

<LD>It takes only a bite to realize that there must be a secret
ingredient in that macaroni and cheese so many people order at the
House on Melrose Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The dish is as rich and creamy as it should be, but it's also
perfectly balanced with a surprising little tang. And the sauce is
just thick enough to evenly coat the pasta, but not so thick it forms
gluey clumps.</LD>
<LD>   The secret? Goat's milk Cheddar.</LD>
<TE>   We followed chef Scooter Kanfer's recipe using the sharp goat's
milk Cheddar made by Redwood Hill Farm in Sonoma County. It's a pale
ivory cheese made from raw milk and aged at least six months. The
texture was so creamy it almost seemed a little wet. It melted
extremely well, and had a distinct goat's milk flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Besides making an excellent mac and cheese, it would be ideal for
grilled cheese sandwiches, quesadillas, crostini and salads. Or just
appreciate it simply, at the end of a meal with fresh fruit.</TE>
<TE>   The cheese is sold at the Redwood Hill Farm stand at the Wednesday
Santa Monica Farmers Market for $9.90 a pound; at the Winchester
Cheese stand at the Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Sunday Santa Monica
farmers markets for the same price; and at Whole Foods markets for
$19.99 a pound. It can be ordered online at www. redwoodhill.com.</TE>

<HD>Maestro of the Polo Lounge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's cocktail hour at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel. An
immaculately dressed Italian in a light wool suit and Savile Row tie
stands at the reception table chatting amiably with the maitre d'. A
young, briskly efficient American receptionist fields a small storm
of phone calls. The first possible break and she turns to the
Italian, thrusts out her hand and cries, "Nino! We haven't met. I am
Katrina. I'm new. It's an honor to meet you! You're a legend here."</LD>
<LD>   The Italian is briefly startled. He takes the eagerly extended
hand, but he doesn't shake it. Rather, he lifts it to his lips,
kisses it lightly, cups it ever so briefly with his free hand, then
gives it two small pats, as if to say "Thank you."</LD>
<LD>   This infinitely gracious recovery, the kiss, the pats: This was
the language of the Polo Lounge from 1968 to 1998, the 30 years that
Nino Osti was its manager. It is the style of a man who waited on the
crown princes of Europe and made Hollywood celebrities feel like
royalty.</LD>
<TE>   "Nino was a maestro," says Piero Selvaggio, the proprietor of
Valentino in Santa Monica. Selvaggio, the presiding host in Los
Angeles, started as a busboy at the Beverly Hills Hotel more than 30
years ago. "It was the most magic place in Los Angeles. But if you
think about it, the Polo Lounge is just like an empty stage, a room.
But it came alive every night. It was a temple, not for food but for
society. Nino orchestrated it."</TE>
<TE>   Osti retired four years ago. There are those who will argue that
madcap elegance of old Hollywood retired with him. Coaxing him back
to the Polo Lounge for even a brief visit took concerted importuning.
He wasn't sure he could stand the disorienting mix of the comfort of
nostalgia and shock of the new.</TE>
<TE>   The walls are the same rich green they have always been. There is
the booth where LeRoy Neiman used to sit and sketch the guests. There
are even jacks for plug-in phones.</TE>
<TE>   But the jaunty pink tablecloths are gone. The boisterous page, a
midget Osti used to introduce as the bouncer, is dead. The cigarette
girl is long gone. There is piped music filtering in, a curious
reggae cover of a Cat Stevens song. Strangest for cocktail hour, the
place is less than half full.</TE>
<TE>   In Osti's day, says Selvaggio, getting in was a trick. "Nino
became the password."</TE>
<TE>   That applied in spite of the place's being lushly formal. Men had
to wear jackets and ties. Overseeing this room, Osti wore suits at
lunch, a tuxedo in the evening. For Osti, the tux was a uniform with
a code of confidence every bit as binding as a priest's collar. Press
him for details about who came in with Frank Sinatra, who left with
Orson Welles, what Ronald Reagan drank, how much, how often and how
he held it, Osti will school you in the gentle art of evasion.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, I could name names," he'll say, "but I don't want to forget
someone."</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, so many memories, I couldn't choose one."</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, I could talk about it for hours, but that would be torment."</TE>
<TE>   Open the clip files, and one finds that on the rare occasions when
he rewarded prying columnists with a scrap of gossip, it was
something painfully obvious--that Welles spoke loudly, or that Jack
Lemmon was an amusing drunk.</TE>
<TE>   Read enough of them, and one can't help but notice that the
profiles, ostensibly about Osti, are always about those whom Osti
served, never about Osti himself. It amounts to a peculiar kind of
flattery, this invisibility. Osti's art is like the seam in a good
suit. You don't notice it.</TE>
<TE>   Osti didn't so much learn his trade as be born to it. The son of a
restaurateur, he grew up in Milan. In 1943, at 14, he was already
busing tables in Biffi, one of the city's top restaurants. By 17,
like so many Italians of his generation, he was off to Switzerland,
to Lausanne, to a job in a plush hotel. On the train north, he
spotted a petite, dark-haired girl with a round face, an unwanted
admirer and a temper.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a shoe in her hand, ready to hit this guy in the head,"
says Osti. The girl, a Sardinian named Ada Manca, turned out to be a
laundress at the Royal Savoy, the same place he worked. She ironed
fine linen and lace, the most special and delicate of garments, of
the elite guests, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Osti got up the nerve to ask her on a boat ride, during which a
sudden swell scared the girl into a screaming terror. The next day,
says Osti, "A customer from the hotel said, 'Nino, who was that wild
girl you had in the boat?' He was Juan Carlos, king of Spain."</TE>
<TE>   From Switzerland, it was on to a chateau in Luxembourg and waiting
on Perle Mesta, the "hostess with the mostess'" who was Truman's
ambassador there, or "Madam Minister," as she liked to be called. The
eating habits of the teetotaling Oklahoma-born Christian Scientist
shocked the Italian.</TE>
<TE>   "She said to me, 'Young man, this is a business dinner. When I put
my plate down, clear the table.' So I was watching, and she was a
really fast eater. I thought, 'Oh my God. What am I going to do?'"</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, he moved to Canada, where he worked in a private club.
Within months, he wrote to Ada saying, "It's kind of lonely out here.
It's probably kind of lonely where you are, too. Why don't you come
out here and we'll get married?'"</TE>
<TE>   By 1959, the Canadian cold and all that dirty snow drove the
Italian couple south, and west, to Los Angeles. From 1960 to 1968,
Osti worked at La Rue on Sunset Strip, a restaurant dating to 1943.
It had a special phone line for Sinatra's reservations and served all
the swell food of the day, says Osti, "You know, caviar and crepe
suzette, Dover sole, tournedos Rossini."</TE>
<TE>   After seating all the guests and ensuring that their orders were
taken, he would oil the social wheels. "I used to tell the owner, Mr.
Bruno, go say hello to so-and-so, and go say hello to so-and-so."</TE>
<TE>   Osti's silky touch, the habitual grace with which he could bone a
sole and the sure way he never over-fired a flambe pan, did not
escape the notice of Ben Silberstein, then owner of the Beverly Hills
Hotel. Silberstein began pestering him to move to the Polo Lounge.
Osti wanted to open his own restaurant with a chef from Perino's.
That didn't work out. "My friend at Perino's goes home one night has
a stroke and he dies," says Osti. So he took the job at the Polo
Lounge on a "temporary basis."</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills Hotel was already a haunt of the stars and had
been since Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks days. Osti didn't care
who the customers were as long as they met the dress code. "'Treat
everybody nice and you can't go wrong' is my credo," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Selvaggio goes further. "You have tables that are in very, very
high demand," he says. "You have clients where the position--being
seen in the right place with the right table--is everything. He had
the capacity of knowing who to put where. There has to be a real
affinity for people."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, he kept the mood high by making short work of
sassy waiters. "I used to say, 'Don't ever go over and say to a
customer, 'You did too order this.' Never argue."</TE>
<TE>   A big name never compensated for making a reservation too late. On
the occasions when he could not seat a regular, Osti would cry, "I am
more embarrassed than you!" He would then phone the customer the next
day to apologize and beg the customer to give him "a little bit more
notice" next time.</TE>
<TE>   He had built up the lunch crowd to 300 covers a day when
Silberstein asked him to take on nights. Osti recalls, "I remember
going by one night and wondering, 'What are all those hookers doing
here?'"</TE>
<TE>   One of Silberstein's vice presidents suggested demanding the
identification from every woman who came in alone. "It was such a
terrible idea. I said, 'Forget it! I'll take care of it.'" Osti's
solution was to seat single women near wives of married customers.</TE>
<TE>   "That sort of controlled it," says Osti. "But I used to tell even
the owner, 'This is not a church.'"</TE>
<TE>   Eventually he was a celebrity in his own right. Long-time
customers Kitty Carlisle and Soupy Sales could scarcely keep straight
faces as he went on "To Tell the Truth." The contestant had to pick
whether he was the manager of the Polo Lounge or the operator of a
float of gondolas in Venice. The contestant guessed gondolier.</TE>
<TE>   (At home, Ada berated him for not allowing her to believe it.)</TE>
<TE>   His greatest genius was for solving problems. When he finally
convinced management to take out a booth to move the piano to an
accessible spot, Christopher Plummer took to playing it.</TE>
<TE>   On Super Bowl nights, he'd call waiters together for his own
pre-game huddles. "Try to suggest a bottle of champagne," he'd say.
"Making 10 drinks will take too much time. Nobody will get an order.
Leave the empty bottles in a visible spot so the next people see them
and want champagne too." The night the Denver Broncos played the New
York Giants, he reckons they had the bar packed six per booth and
served 1,300.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1992, even Osti couldn't keep the place full. Hollywood had
changed. Silberstein was dead, the hotel had repeatedly changed
owners, staff was demoralized and the Beverly Hills Hotel was down to
30% occupancy.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the riots, "I remember I had to sleep in the hotel,"
says Osti. "I had to phone my wife and say, 'Ada, I wish you were
here. We've got the best suite.'"</TE>
<TE>   The next year, the hotel closed for refurbishment by the sultan of
Brunei, and Merv Griffin invited Osti to Trader Vic's.</TE>
<TE>   "They flew me to San Francisco," he recalls. "I said, 'Why do you
want me? I don't know nothing about your food. I don't know nothing
about your fancy drinks.' But they said, 'You know people.'"</TE>
<TE>   For 21/2 years, the man who had poured Robert Mitchum's scotches
learned how to put orchids in mai tais and gardenias in stingers. He
struck the low-selling dishes so customers didn't have to spend "the
first 20 minutes reading a long menu." He even learned some Chinese
to joke with the waiters.</TE>
<TE>   He was happy, he says. But when the Beverly Hills Hotel
refurbishment was completed in 1995, the management came looking for
him to relaunch the Polo Lounge. Osti hesitated, he says, but "when
they told me they had kept the same decor, the same green walls, my
heart went like this." He makes a patting gesture on his chest.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone from "60 Minutes" to the New Yorker magazine and even
Huell Howser seized on Osti as the soul of the bar during the
relaunch of the hotel. "He was one of the key elements to bring back
the old glory, the old luster," says Selvaggio. "But mostly the
Beverly Hills Hotel wasn't performing the old magic."</TE>
<TE>   Osti was indeed unhappy. He could make neither heads nor tails of
the new computerized phone system. The dress code was gone. Smart
crowds had moved on to Morton's, Spago and the Ivy. He stayed only
three years before retiring in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He spent his first New Year's Eve with his family. He and Ada
traveled and spent time with their sons, Nicholas and Daniel, and
grandchildren, Francesca, Nicholas and Christiana. Plummer got them
seats to "Barrymore" in front of Ann Miller. News of this flew across
Italy, where relatives joked about their being celebrities. He
introduced his grandchildren to an astronaut. They decorated their
home with drawings by Neiman, a wooden duck from Johnny Carson,
photos with Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 19, 2000, the bliss was shattered. He awoke at 3 a.m. to
find Ada struggling for air in a sudden asthma attack. "She said, 'Io
vado,'" whispers Osti. "It's Italian, for 'I'm going.'" Within hours,
his wife of 48 years was dead.</TE>
<TE>   The good and the great flocked to console Osti. Producer Arthur
Cohn wrote. Plummer embraced his old friend. Two years later, Osti is
still stunned by the loss and its incomprehensible suddenness.</TE>
<TE>   But this recent evening as he sits in the Polo Lounge, time plays
tricks on him. It could be 1968. The fact that the sultan of Brunei
didn't change the decor outside that infernal modern phone console is
both disturbing and comforting. "Maybe it should have changed," he
says. "We have."</TE>
<TE>   Pepe, the new tuxedoed maitre d', leads a party of guests past the
table. The guests wear shorts and slapping flip-flops. Osti winces.</TE>
<TE>   But in the next instant, another set of guests arrives. They are
dressed elegantly. They are old-time regulars. He is quick to his
feet, smiling with perfectly pitched bonhomie, greeting old friends
much as he has for three decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Nino was a star before people in restaurants became stars," says
Selvaggio. "He's a dying breed. Being a great maitre d' takes a
tremendous commitment and love for people, whether they're good, bad
or indifferent."</TE>

<LD>"A '97 Penfolds Grange. It was our 15th wedding anniversary. The wine
was unbelievable. There's a lot of hype with a lot of wines, and
sometimes they're all style and no substance. But the Grange has a
lot of substance--there's a lot going on in that bottle. '97 was not
one of the classic years by any means, but this lives up to its
pedigree."</LD>

<HD>The Essence of Smoke and Spice</HD>
<DH>Intricately spiced satays are a ritual in Thailand</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SU-MEI YU</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walk through Bangkok on a cool, quiet morning and you'll see puffs of
smoke rising from each side of the street. The air will be filled
with the scents of searing chile and cilantro, and the sounds of a
city stirring to life. Every day before sunrise, the same ritual
takes place: Thailand's satay vendors set up their carts, thread thin
slices of meat onto bamboo skewers and grill them over a vigorously
fanned charcoal fire.</LD>
<LD>   The seductive aroma--of smoke and meat and intriguing spices--is
the perfume of a Thai morning.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the lackluster versions so common in American Thai
restaurants, where they seem to be part of the standard appetizer
platter served alongside a pile of mee krob, real Thai satays are
intricately spiced and endlessly inventive. They can be made with
almost anything that can be cooked over an open fire--shrimp,
chicken, pork or even tiny whole fish and frogs.</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, because they can be prepared in advance to be
finished quickly just before serving, they also fit well into an
American summer menu, served either as appetizers or the main course.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout central and southern Thailand the satay scene is
repeated. The vendors are everywhere, in big cities and in small
provincial towns. They are at street corners, obscure lanes, busy
traffic-jammed intersections, open-air markets and even modern
supermarkets. Sold a handful at a time with a bag of cucumber relish
and peanut sauce, satays are a perfect snack to eat on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Even though they are everywhere in Thailand today, satays are
actually a fairly modern addition to the national cuisine. They
became the rage during the reign of King Chulalongkorn, who ruled
from 1868 to 1910. Known as a connoisseur, Chulalongkorn established
his royal court as an epicurean center. He was the first Thai monarch
to travel abroad, and among the many places he visited were Singapore
and Penang, a southern border town in Malaysia where he encountered
tiny skewers of grilled food dipped in savory sauces and called
satays.</TE>
<TE>   Shish kebab of one kind or other is characteristic of Muslim
cuisines, so satay may ultimately be a Middle Eastern import. The
Muslim traders who converted the Javanese to Islam exerted a strong
culinary influence on the islanders. The flavorings of satay are
Southeast Asian, though.</TE>
<TE>   Thai satay recipes are versatile. They are constantly being
altered to the tastes of different regions of the country, and even
of local neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   One vendor in Bangkok's Chinatown marinates long pieces of thinly
sliced pork with a touch of cumin, red chile powder and loads of
minced garlic, turmeric powder and coconut cream. When grilled, it is
slightly crispy and a bit chewy, like soft jerky.</TE>
<TE>   Another vendor in Phet Buri (Petchaburi), a province approximately
21/2 hours by car from Bangkok, uses more turmeric in the marinade,
staining the pork into glowing golden color. She also adds a chunk of
pork fat at the tip of the flattened pork strip. When grilled, the
fat is the best-tasting part of the satay, having turned crisp from
the grill. Her peanut sauce is sweeter than most, loaded with more
coconut cream and palm sugar, to please the local addiction to sweet
food.</TE>
<TE>   But there are certain things that are constant. For one thing,
Thais prefer charcoal to gas for cooking. The more intense heat sears
the food, browning the outside layer. Once the flames die down, the
ash-covered red embers provide a constant heat that allows food to
cook evenly.</TE>
<TE>   Although charcoal briquettes are readily available, search out
lump hardwood charcoal. It is closest to what Asians use to fuel
their grills. Though briquettes are convenient, they contain
additives that can impart a chemical taste.</TE>
<TE>   Also, they cut the meat into pieces small enough to cook quickly
over the high heat. Long, thin slices are the preferred form. They
can be neatly and securely threaded onto skewers.</TE>
<TE>   These sticks can be made of metal, wood, split bamboo or even
aromatic branches such as lemongrass stalks. To prevent them from
burning, soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes, then dry them
thoroughly before using. If you choose metal skewers, look for the
thin flat ones, which will prevent the meat from slipping.</TE>
<TE>   To me, the most exquisite of all satay recipes is the one by M.L.
Neong, who grew up in one of the lesser palaces after King
Chulalongkorn's reign. One day I was fortunate to be invited to lunch
with her by a mutual friend. Spry, rather petite and regal-looking,
she lived in a small wooden Thai-style home with her longtime
companion and lady-in-waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Neoung's recipe for satay originally came from one of the
aristocratic ladies of the court, who learned it from a Javanese. It
became one of the favorite dishes of a royal princess who bestowed it
with a special name--satay leuh, meaning "famous satay," for its
alluring and irresistible taste.</TE>
<TE>   The secret for this famous satay recipe is in its marinade and the
way the meat is laced through the skewer. Neoung said that unlike the
common folk's satay, which to her was crude and simple, this recipe
cleverly altered the Javanese recipe by reducing the amount of spices
in the marinade to retain the flavor of the meat.</TE>
<TE>   Paper-thin slices of pork--prohibited to Muslims but preferred by
the Thais--are marinated with freshly dry-roasted spices. They are
laced on a thin whittled palm frond and pushed together so tightly
that they resemble one solid chunk of meat. The satay is served
piping hot, fresh off the grill, with sweet-syrupy sauce.</TE>
<TE>   A bite of the moist succulent satay, juicy and scented with traces
of ancient spices, sent me on a journey with Neoung, back to her
childhood, to the fairy tale life of the royal court, where food was
considered not merely human sustenance, but a creative expression of
civilized people.</TE>

<TE>   1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup fresh unsweetened coconut cream</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons sake</TE>
<TE>   1 pound pork tenderloin, sliced into 1-to 6-inch paper-thin slices</TE>
<TE>   10 to 12 bamboo skewers, soaked in water</TE>
<TE>   Vegetable oil spray</TE>
<TE>   In a medium mixing bowl, combine coriander seeds, cumin seeds,
shallot, peanuts, turmeric, salt, sugar and brown sugar. Add the
coconut cream and sake and mix well. Add the pork and mix to coat
thoroughly. Cover and let sit for up to 1 hour at room temperature,
or, if making ahead of time, cover and refrigerate; it will keep
overnight. Remove from the refrigerator an hour before grilling, to
come to room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Mound the charcoals along one side of the grill, leaving the other
half empty. Heat the grill.</TE>
<TE>   While waiting for the grill to get hot, thread 3 to 4 pieces of
pork onto each bamboo skewer into a tight bundle, covering 5 inches
of the skewer.</TE>
<TE>   Spray the pork generously with vegetable oil spray. Lay the
skewers with the meat portion on the grill over medium-high heat,
arranging them very close to one another. (The uncovered portion of
the skewers should not be over the coals.) Grill, turning frequently
to prevent burning until the outside is crispy brown and the inside
white and tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and
serve immediately.</TE>

<TE>   2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   Place the peppercorns in a small skillet and dry-roast over
medium-high heat, sliding the skillet back and forth over the burner
to prevent burning, until the spice exudes a pleasant aroma, about 1
minute. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool. Repeat
with the coriander seeds. Grind the peppercorns and coriander seeds
together and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the garlic, peppercorns and coriander seeds, ginger,
cayenne, salt, basil and soy sauce in a bowl and mix well. Add the
oil and mix again to combine. Set aside. (Stored in a glass jar with
a tight-fitting lid, the marinade will keep for a week in the
refrigerator.)</TE>

<TE>   Meanwhile, add the shrimp to the marinade and mix well to coat.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes, but no longer than 1
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Mound the charcoal in one side of the grill, leaving the other
side empty. Heat the grill.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator. Thread a shrimp from the
tail through the body to the head onto a bamboo skewer, adding 3 to 4
shrimp to each skewer. Repeat with the remaining shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   Spray the shrimp generously with vegetable oil. Lay the skewers
with the shrimp portion on the grill over medium-high heat, arranging
them very close to one another. (The uncovered portion of the skewers
should not be over the coals.) Grill, turning frequently to prevent
burning and brushing with the reserved marinade, until the shrimp are
pink and firm, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vouvrays are among the most interesting dry white wines in the world
and are still tremendously undervalued. This dry, minerally Chenin
Blanc from one of Vouvray's best producers is a wonderful summer wine
that goes particularly well with Asian flavors.</LD>
<LD>   You can drink it young, but it also develops compelling honeyed
nuances with some age. Very few white wines under $20 have the
substance to improve with age; this is one.</LD>
<LD>   About $18. Available at Beverage Warehouse in Marina del Rey,
(310) 306-2822; Epicurus in Santa Monica, (310) 395-1352; Wally's in
West Los Angeles, (310) 475-0606; and Brigg's in Brentwood, (310)
476-1223. If you can't find it, have your local wine shop contact
distributor Robert Chadderdon Selections at (212) 775-8185.</LD>

<LD>Vegetable purees make nice soups that taste and feel rich, but use
only a little added fat. For this vegetarian soup, cook zucchini in a
combination of water and vegetable broth to allow the flavor of the
zucchini to come through. Puree the soup in a blender or use a
hand-held immersion blender to puree it right in the saucepan. All
you'll need is a couple tablespoons of whipping cream to turn this
simple mixture into a soup that seems rich and creamy, even though it
could be diet food.</LD>

<LD>The heat's on in the San Joaquin Valley, and after a month of so-so
"season-starter" stone fruit, better varieties are arriving every
week. Apricots, Pluots, Apriums and white peaches were all in
abundance at the Thursday Westwood farmers market.</LD>
<LD>   For Pluots, try Flavorosas like those grown by Robert Mizuno of
Reedley. They have sweet, juicy red flesh and a touch of astringency
in the skin. Apriums are another plum-apricot hybrid, this time with
the accent on the apricot. Flavor Annes, like the ones brought by
Orosi's Ken Lee, are darker, denser and juicier than most early
apricots. So are Honey Riches like the ones sold at the Pritchett
stand out of Visalia.</LD>
<LD>   Mizuno's Jordanne apricots are also good, much better than the
Castlebrites--beautifully blushed but bland--that are everywhere
right now. The much-loved Blenheims, the cream of the apricot crop,
won't be here until the end of the month.</LD>
<TE>   Early white peaches are also in the market now, but the Spring
Snows that Lee had, though lusciously ripe, were mild in flavor--like
most of the new low-acid varieties. Many people prefer this style
because it seems sweeter even when the peach is not picked at the
peak of ripeness. By July, tastier varieties should be available.</TE>
<TE>   There's good produce coming out of Southern California as well.
Melons and sweet corn are being harvested in the desert by farms such
as Kelomar, which works several large tracts near Brawley. It's got
red, orange and yellow seedless watermelons right now, along with
aromatic cantaloupes and super-sweet Bicolor corn.</TE>
<TE>   Nearer the coast, there's a new crop of Valencia oranges being
picked, such as those brought by Bob Polito of Valley Center. They're
good now, but will be at their peak in another month. Polito, a
citrus specialist, also has agretti, a traditional Italian spring
vegetable with chive-like tubes and a flavor hinting at beet leaves
and chard. Agretti are good blanched and dressed with olive oil and
lemon juice.</TE>
<TE>   Keep an eye out for zucchini blossoms, too, like the ones sold at
Lompoc's Suncoast stand. They're good simply dipped in an egg-flour
batter and fried.</TE>
<TE>   Another seasonal vegetable highlight are new potatoes, such as the
creamy French fingerlings brought by Weiser Family Farms in Edison,
so fresh that their skins were peeling off. They've also got Russian
Banana fingerlings in two sizes, small and tiny--the latter made
possible by their new ultra-fine harvester from Germany.</TE>

<LD>Bitoque is a French adaptation of bitok, a sort of Russian hamburger
given a lighter texture with bread crumbs and served with sour cream
sauce. Accompany it with matchstick potatoes and a salad of dandelion
greens, and serve fruit for dessert.</LD>
<LD>   Chewy, high-gluten crumbs, such as those from English muffins,
will create a good texture. (The French and the Russians like to soak
the crumbs in milk, but I prefer onion juice.) This is a good use for
a stale English muffin, but you can make crumbs from a fresh one and
dry them out.</LD>
<LD>   Don't use really fatty hamburger for this. On the other hand,
extremely lean hamburger will have a disappointing flavor; 20%-fat
ground beef is best. Light sour cream is as good or even better than
rich sour cream for the sauce.</LD>

<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 English muffin</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion</TE>
<TE>   1 pound ground beef</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon pepper</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   Oil for frying</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon of flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 to 1/3 cup sour cream</TE>
<TE>   Grind the English muffin to crumbs in a food processor. If fresh,
dry the crumbs in a microwave oven or by tossing in a skillet.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, puree the onion in the blender. Strain the onion juice
through a strainer and discard the solids. Mix the onion juice with
the crumbs and squeeze out any excess juice.</TE>
<TE>   Place the crumbs, beef, salt, pepper and a few grindings of nutmeg
in a food processor and process until it forms a ball on top of the
blade, or knead thoroughly by hand. Form the meat into 4 patties and
dust on both sides with flour.</TE>
<TE>   Heat about 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat until a corner of one of the patties sizzles
immediately if dipped into the oil. Fry the patties until browned on
both sides, 3 to 4 minutes, and remove to a warm platter.</TE>
<TE>   Pour off the oil. Add the chicken broth and scrape up the browned
bits from the skillet. Bring to a simmer. Stir the flour into the
sour cream until smooth. Add the sour cream to the skillet and return
to a simmer, stirring, 1 minute. Serve the patties with the sour
cream sauce.</TE>

<LD>Whenever I go to the farmers market, particularly at this time of
year, I always find that I've bought way too much. I come home laden
with far more tomatoes, squash, eggplants and bell peppers than I'll
be able to use in any single meal. The best thing to do is just grill
them all up. Serve most of them as a side dish the first night, but
save a couple of cups' worth to use as a filling for this vegetable
tart.</LD>
<LD>   The best utensil for grilling vegetables is a grill basket. But
even if you don't have one, it's easy enough. Cut the vegetables into
pieces that are manageably sized, then toss them in a bowl with a
couple tablespoons of olive oil, about a tablespoon of balsamic
vinegar and a teaspoon or so each of dried thyme and basil. Add salt
and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Grill the vegetables until
the are tender through, turning frequently to keep them from
scorching.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Tomato and Grilled Vegetable Tart</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   1 refrigerated piecrust for 9-inch pie</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried</TE>
<TE>   2 cups coarsely chopped grilled vegetables, such as red bell
pepper, cremini mushrooms and shallots</TE>
<TE>   2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup thinly sliced basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds red, yellow and orange tomatoes, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Coat the inside of a 9-inch tart pan
with a removable bottom with the cooking spray.</TE>
<TE>   Fit the piecrust into the pan and fold the excess crust under to
reinforce the sides of the tart. Prick the bottom of the crust with a
fork. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and brush
the bottom with the mustard. Sprinkle with the chopped thyme and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Stir together the grilled vegetables, Gruyere, basil and salt and
pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Spread the vegetable mixture evenly in the crust. Starting at the
outside edge, place the tomato slices on top, overlapping the slices
and alternating the colors until you have reached the center.
Sprinkle the tomatoes with the Parmesan.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese mixture is
bubbling, 40 to 50 minutes. Slice and serve warm or at room
temperature.</TE>

<TE>   Imagine crushing blood oranges together with hand-picked Mission
olives. The olive oil picks up the fragrant oils in the orange rind,
becoming subtly flavored. Blood Orange Olive Oil is the latest
product from the Olive Press, a 6-year-old partnership of 13 olive
growers in Glen Ellen, Calif. Drizzle the oil over fennel or spinach
salads, spring asparagus or other vegetables, or use it to add some
pizazz to simple grilled salmon or roasted chicken.</TE>

<HD>The Central Coast--Our New Chardonnay Country</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one carries on about Chardonnay these days. Pinot Noir and Syrah,
Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel--those are the grapes that dominate
conversations about wine and are the leading candidates to separate
you from some serious money. Talk about new Chardonnay discoveries to
a group of serious wine drinkers and most of them will roll their
eyes at the thought of yet another ripe, oaky bottling from yet
another winery.</LD>
<LD>   But if you truly care about wine, it is a mistake to dismiss
Chardonnay--and not just because of the famous (and expensive) ones
from Napa and Sonoma, and not just because it continues to be the
most consumed variety of all.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, after tasting hundreds of Chardonnays from California,
Washington and Oregon, I found many exceptional wines from
California's Central Coast. These have long stood out for their
direct fruitiness and exquisite balance. But now, I'm also
discovering increasing numbers that also have complexity and
ageworthiness.</LD>
<TE>   They are examples of world-class winemaking, and the results of
proven vineyards and maturing winemakers. The potential has always
been there, and it has not been missed by Central Coast stalwarts
such as Au Bon Climat and Ojai, Byron and Chalone. The difference is
that today, those revered names are being joined by others who are
building on the experiences of those that led the way.</TE>
<TE>   The best of the new breed boast great concentration and plenty of
ripeness. They no longer rely on the immediate fruitiness and
tropical notes so easily captured in the best locations of the area.
Along with their deeper, broader fruit has come fuller-bodied wines
and an ability to integrate oaky richness without giving in to the
toasty and caramelized vanillin notes that the barrel contributes.</TE>
<TE>   New names like Testarossa and Clos La Chance, Lafond and Varner
have joined the ranks of wineries that are creating a Chardonnay
dynasty in the Central Coast. Napa and Sonoma no longer rule the
Chardonnay roost.</TE>
<TE>   ** 2000 Clos La Chance "Vanumanutagi Vineyard," Santa Cruz
Mountains, $28. Don't be put off by the decidedly hazy appearance of
this wine. It is filled with a rich, complex mix of flavors and
aromas: graham cracker, creme brulee and ripe, appley fruit. This is
not a wine for those seeking grace and elegance, but it will find
willing takers among those who revel in intensity and richness.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Lafond Vineyard "SRH," Santa Ynez Valley, $16. Hailing
from the cool, coastal Santa Rita Hills area (hence SRH), this wine
adds oaky richness to comparatively compact fruit. It has a lightly
smoky aroma and just a touch of dryness in the finish. Overall, a
good value.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Rosenblum Cellars "Paragon Vineyard," Edna Valley, $19.
This wine and the Vine Cliff below stand as northern winery tributes
to Central Coast grapes. Here, Bay Area Zinfandel expert Rosenblum
has captured Meyer lemon and pineappley fruit notes to go along with
hints of roasted grains and lightly toasted oak. The wine is somewhat
oily and round in texture, but balanced with energy and firmness.</TE>
<TE>   $** 2000 Talley Vineyards, Arroyo Grande Valley, $22. This is not
the first time I have praised a Talley Chardonnay: They are among the
best-balanced Chardonnays in California. This latest effort starts
with pleasing aromas of lees, rich oak and ripe citrus and green
apple, and follows with deep flavors. It is the biggest and richest
of the Talley regular-bottling Chardonnays so far.</TE>
<TE>   *** 2000 Testarossa Vineyard "Bien Nacido Vineyard," Santa Maria
Valley, $32. A big and compelling wine in every way, this highly
oaked Chardonnay is brimming with honeyed fruit. Yet it also carries
near-perfect acidity and never becomes plodding or heavy-footed. A
fine example of the new breed; give it a try.</TE>
<TE>   ** 2000 Testarossa Vineyard "Michaud Vineyard," Chalone, $34. This
wine, from grapes grown in the mountains on the east side of the
Salinas Valley in the Chalone district, is the restrained relative to
its Santa Maria sibling. It is bright and firmly structured, and
reflects its terroir with flavors of minerals, roasted grains, toast
and honeyed fruit. In a year or two, it should open up a bit.</TE>
<TE>   ** 2000 Varner "Spring Ridge Vineyard, Bee Block," Santa Cruz
Mountains, $30. Like so many of the leading contenders from the
Central Coast, this wine is no shrinking violet. It is simply
overflowing with sweet ripe fruit and extravagant oak, with lemony
and herbal highlights. But its plushness comes at the expense of a
bit of heat in the finish.</TE>
<TE>   ** 2000 Vine Cliff "Bien Nacido Vineyard," Santa Maria Valley,
$36. Napa Valley's Vine Cliff has produced a very well-made wine from
one of Central California's most exceptional vineyards. Despite a
slightly acidic tendency and a touch of finishing coarseness, this
deep, ripe and balanced effort mixes bright, rich notes and vital,
energetic flavors.</TE>

<LD>Anders Karlsson, the head baker at Berolina Bakery, is Swedish, so
you'll find several Scandinavian breads at his Glendale shop. Orange
peel and anise-flavored Swedish limpa is a lightly sweetened rye
bread. Cracked oats sprinkled over the top give it a rustic look.
Ring-shaped Norwegian flat bread is thin and crisp, like a cracker.
Scandinavians eat it with butter or cheese or use it as the base for
open-face sandwiches.</LD>

<HD>Beyond the Human Toll, History and Artifacts Lost</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LUKAS I. ALPERT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>First editions of Helen Keller's books. Sculptures by Auguste Rodin.
Artifacts from the African Burial Ground, a centuries-old Manhattan
cemetery. Thousands of photographs of Broadway, off-Broadway and even
off-off-Broadway shows.</LD>
<LD>   All were lost--along with thousands of other important works of
art, photographs, negatives, artifacts and historical documents--when
the World Trade Center towers collapsed, a new report shows.</LD>
<LD>   "In emergencies, sometimes there is simply nothing you can do,"
said Lawrence L. Reger, president of the group that released the
report. "There was stuff put in vaults that were simply vaporized."</LD>
<TE>   The report, by Heritage Preservation, a Washington, D.C.-based
cultural preservation organization, surveyed 57 museums, archives and
cultural institutions close to the trade center site. It focused on
the scope of what was lost in lower Manhattan and at the Pentagon
during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Within and around the twin towers were works such as Fritz
Koenig's "The Sphere" and the Rodin collection in the offices of
Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond-trading firm that lost 658 of its nearly
1,000 employees Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sphere," which sat in the concourse between the towers, was
badly damaged and now serves as part of a temporary memorial in
nearby Battery Park.</TE>
<TE>   "It was next to a miracle that the Koenig sphere survived in any
way," Reger said.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the rare casts of Rodin sculptures did not survive.
Those that did were badly damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the works of art, thousands of important historical
photographs and documents also were lost.</TE>
<TE>   Almost the complete Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
archive was destroyed, including papers, photographs and blueprints
detailing the construction of the World Trade Center and dozens of
other city landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 40,000 of photographer Jacques Lowe's negatives, detailing
John F. Kennedy's presidency, were lost when 5 World Trade Center was
heavily damaged in the attack, destroying the bank vault where they
were stored. Lowe's family estimated the negatives were worth nearly
$2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people did not think that the World Trade towers had such a
variety and such a wide breadth of historical items," Reger said.</TE>
<TE>   While so much was lost at the trade center, the Heritage
Preservation report also showed that hundreds of thousands of items
in nearby institutions were saved by quick thinking and good
emergency plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that people really took common-sense action, and
that helped save quite a lot," Reger said. "Most of those who did
that had some kind of plan, but we do think too many institutions
don't have proper planning."</TE>
<TE>   For example, just across the street from where the towers once
stood, administrators at the Museum of Jewish Heritage climbed to the
roof and manually cranked vents closed when power was lost. As the
towers burned in the background, they stayed to turn off water
valves, even though police ordered them to leave.</TE>
<TE>   When they returned, not a trace of dust--which can be lethal to
artifacts--was found inside the museum, even though lower Manhattan
was covered in a thick layer.</TE>

<HD>TV Study: Black Roles Are Mixed Bag</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amidst promises by television networks to increase racial diversity
within their programming, African Americans are overrepresented
relative to their percentage of the U.S. population but "ghettoized"
in situation comedies, while other minority groups remain
underrepresented, according to a new UCLA study released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, titled "Prime Time in Black and White: Making Sense of
the 2001 Fall Season," represents the initial phase of a five-year
study that will monitor the presence of blacks in prime-time network
television. The findings are based on a content analysis of 224
episodes of 85 scripted series broadcast on the four major networks,
UPN and the WB in October and November 2001.</LD>
<LD>   According to the study, African American characters were most
visible on UPN, appearing largely on Monday and Saturday nights.
These characters represent 28% of the network's characters, compared
with 12% on other networks. CBS had the second-highest percentage,
with 17%.</LD>
<TE>   The study also said that whites overwhelmingly occupy pivotal
executive producer positions. Although official figures were not
available, black executive producers could only be identified for
five of the 85 shows covered by the study. Four of those shows were
sitcoms featuring predominantly black casts.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of the promise of change on behalf of the networks has been
lip service to appease people," said Darnell Hunt, director of the
UCLA Center for African American Study and author of the report.
"There's been all this anticipation of change, and there has been
very little. Most of the networks have thrown out a few symbolic
gestures and left most of the programming practices intact."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt was also the co-author of a 2000 Screen Actors Guild study
that resulted in similar findings. A recently issued report by
Children Now, a nonprofit organization, also concluded that the
networks have made little progress toward furthering prime-time
diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Although the study raises questions about gains African Americans
have achieved in terms of the quality of their roles and behind the
camera, as a group they have far more opportunities in prime time
than other minorities. Latinos, for example, comprise 12.5% of the
nation's population but account for only 2% of characters on all
prime-time network shows, according to the study. By contrast,
African Americans and whites jointly comprise 82% of the population
yet account for 92% of all prime-time characters.</TE>
<TE>   This study's release comes a few weeks after the announcement of
the new fall TV lineup, which has spurred renewed discussion about
whether the four major networks have taken steps to fulfill pledges
made more than two years ago to increase minority representation in
front of and behind the camera. While most new comedies and dramas
feature at least one minority in their casts, only two of the 26 new
fall series on ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox feature a minority in a starring
role.</TE>
<TE>   Network officials have stated that they feel as if they are making
significant progress on the issue of diversity, pointing out that
several minority performers are featured in key roles in the new
dramas and comedies. The major networks have also initiated showcases
to find fresh minority talent, and several new programs on smaller
networks--including the WB, UPN and cable channels such as HBO and
Showtime--prominently feature minority actors and actresses.</TE>

<HD>Is Paranoia Mushrooming in Baltimore? It's a Movie</HD>
<DH>Entertainment* The city's nuclear annihilation in 'The Sum
of All Fears' isn't rattling residents in the least.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KALTENBACH</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Baltimore gets nuked in "The Sum of All Fears." And people here seem
to be taking it all in stride.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't heard a whole lot on the street about it, to be
honest," says Mayor Martin O'Malley, who attended a special screening
of the film. "It's certainly riveting to see your skyline with a
mushroom cloud rolling over it. But then, Hollywood has been sending
tidal waves over New York for years."</LD>
<LD>   In the film, based on Baltimore native Tom Clancy's 1991 novel,
his hometown falls victim to the ultimate terrorist attack while
hosting the Super Bowl (yet another flight of fancy). Clancy's hero,
Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck, taking over for Harrison Ford, who played
Ryan in two earlier films), then has to convince U.S. leaders that
terrorists were behind the attack, and not the Russians.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever Ryan succeeds or doesn't succeed in doing, Baltimore does
not fare well here. But contrary to what some nervous prognosticators
feared, no mass paranoia seems to be gripping the city; no one seems
overly concerned that fiction and truth might be reflective of each
other.</TE>
<TE>   The city police chief won't talk about it, fire officials say it
isn't on their radar screens and theater operators say they haven't
noticed any undue concern over what Hollywood has devised for Charm
City.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing," says Scott Cohen, of R/C Theaters, which is playing the
film at its Eastpoint and Carrolltowne Mall cinemas. "I haven't heard
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Down the road in Washington, D.C., officials of the U.S. Customs
Office staged a news conference this week to show off all the
technological wizardry they've put in place to ensure renegade atomic
bomb parts don't find their way into or out of this country
undetected.</TE>
<TE>   But even they had to admit they weren't reacting to any upsurge in
concern over the possibility of such an event happening; the movie's
release just provided them a handy excuse to tell the public what has
changed in the 10 years since Clancy wrote his book. That includes
not only improved technology, but greater sharing of information with
our country's trading partners.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm told it is a very well-put-together movie," says Customs
spokesman Jim Michie, "and Tom Clancy always writes a very good book.
But something like this happening is very, very unlikely. It might
have happened in 1991, but not today."</TE>
<TE>   And if you're concerned that the movie was No. 1 at the box office
last weekend (bringing in $31.2 million), and worry that means people
are flocking to theaters because of some sense the filmmakers are
onto something, don't be. This is the fourth Clancy novel to be
turned into a movie, and all four have opened at No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, it's the Clancy franchise that's putting people
in the seats, not obsession with an impending Armageddon.</TE>
<TE>   And here in Charm City? "I think Baltimoreans are always kind of

<HD>Unseen Consequences of the Best Intentions</HD>
<DH>'T-Shirt Travels,' tonight on KCET, looks at the impact
that donations of used clothing can have on other economies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is something to think about, along with that tax write-off, the
next time you donate old clothes to charity. The documentary "T-Shirt
Travels: The Story of Secondhand Clothes and Third World Debt" (on
KCET tonight at 10) suggests that giving the shirt off your back can
have unintended effects in our new world economy.</LD>
<LD>   "You never know how far your clothes can go," says one cheery
passerby interviewed on a New Jersey boardwalk, perhaps unaware that
tons of U.S. donations have found their way to Zambia, in effect
crushing the African nation's garment-making industry.</LD>
<LD>   Shantha Bloemen's provocative and politically charged one-hour
film looks at the surprising impact of secondhand clothes on
international economics. More broadly, she uses the garment trade as
Exhibit A in an indictment of Africa's "economic colonialism" at the
hands of global bankers more worried about capital than people.</LD>
<TE>   Bloemen tells the bittersweet story of Luka Mafo, an industrious
19-year-old Zambian clothing vendor, to illustrate how the secondhand
garment trade works, while talking heads blame the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund for Africa's economic woes.</TE>
<TE>   Bloemen, a former relief worker at a remote Zambian village who
became fascinated by the incongruous images of local residents
sporting AC/DC T-shirts or Chanel knockoff jackets, shines a light on
a multibillion-dollar industry that has turned Africa into a dumping
ground for used goods from North America and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Charities such as the Salvation Army sell many of their donated
clothes to commercial dealers for 10 to 15 cents a pound. These
clothes are then shipped to Africa, where vendors like Mafo buy them
for $180 a bale, a markup of 300% to 400%. The vendors sell the
garments at outdoor markets called "bend-down boutiques," hoping to
eke out a profit.</TE>
<TE>   In Mafo's case, he travels 10 hours by bus to the capital city of
Lusaka to fetch each batch. After the market he hauls his unsold
garments to the river, trading them for fish, which he tries to sell
back at the capital. It's all part of a struggle to keep his siblings
in school and, perhaps, to someday realize his dream of buying a home
with electricity and water for his family.</TE>
<TE>   Bloemen captures the daily rhythms of a trying life. This is a
hand-to-mouth business for Mafo--and for the unemployed nurses,
teachers, civil servants and others in the same trade.</TE>
<TE>   As compelling as this case study is, Bloemen's broader case
against globalization is not entirely convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Zambia's mountain of debt stemming from borrowing in the 1970s,
when prices spiked for oil and plunged for its prized resource,
copper, has left the country at the mercy of creditors and in a state
of disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   Free-market reforms demanded by creditors over the last 20 years
have created great hardship, no doubt. Liberalized import laws, for
example, led to the flood of cheap goods that has wiped out Zambia's
textile and garment manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   But it's hard to believe that Zambia's leaders share none of the
blame for the nation's troubles. It's unclear how a hands-off policy
by bankers would enable the country to climb out from its debt.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bloemen's pointed questions are intriguing, even if she
doesn't have all the answers.</TE>

<HD>Wasserman Made Old Hollywood Into New</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NEAL GABLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lew R. Wasserman, who died Monday at age 89, was the only film
executive of the last 40 years whom one could compare to the great
generation of movie pioneers: Carl Laemmle, William Fox, Adolph
Zukor, Louis B. Mayer, the Warner brothers, Harry Cohn. Wasserman was
not one of them--he came much later--but he was their equal in rank
because, like them, he shaped the institutions of the industry and
fashioned its culture after his image. Where he led, everyone
followed. In many respects, they still do.</LD>
<LD>   Wasserman, however, was a different breed from the pioneers,
different at first by circumstance and then by intention. That first
generation, mostly Eastern European Jewish immigrants, had muddled
their way into the movie industry through exhibition; they understood
public taste and brought that understanding to production. Wasserman
pushed his way into the industry by representing performers as an
agent; he understood talent.</LD>
<TE>   He was born in Cleveland in 1913 and gravitated early to show
business, selling candy at a burlesque theater, ushering and managing
a nightclub before hooking up in 1936 with the Music Corp. of
America, a talent agency headed by an ophthalmologist named Jules
Stein. Stein mentored Wasserman--the agency represented most of the
biggest bands in the '30s and '40s--and Wasserman, who became
president of MCA in 1946, repaid Stein's faith by expanding the
company's reach into Hollywood, where his stable of stars included
Bette Davis, Jimmy Stewart, Marilyn Monroe, Burt Lancaster and Ronald
Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   The timing was auspicious. In the postwar period, the film
industry was beleaguered. The Justice Department, invoking its
antitrust powers, had forced the studios to sell off their theaters.
Television and other new recreations were siphoning off audience. The
House Un-American Activities Committee hearings shook Hollywood's
confidence and intensified its fractiousness. And the moguls
themselves were aged and weary, and no longer had the stamina to
prevent their studios from crumbling. In time, nearly all these
iron-fisted dictators would be unceremoniously deposed.</TE>
<TE>   And that is where Lew Wasserman came in. Like Lyndon Johnson, who
would later become his close friend, Wasserman understood power. He
saw that with the demise of the studios there was now a power vacuum,
and he realized that the most natural force to fill it was talent. It
was Wasserman who fought the unconscionable studio contracts that
effectively made his clients indentured servants, Wasserman who
engineered the first deals that ensured his prime clients a
percentage of the profits of a picture rather than a straight salary
and, above all, Wasserman who facilitated the first independent
production companies run by stars. In effect, Wasserman was the man
who put the inmates in charge of the Hollywood asylum.</TE>
<TE>   What Wasserman erected remains to this day. The film industry is
still fundamentally talent-driven, which means that big stars and big
directors are even more powerful than the executives who must vie for
them. But Wasserman, again like Johnson, was not content to let
himself be an adjunct to those he represented. He knew that while
talent was the source of power, a man who could merge the talent with
production would be the wielder of that power and the reaper of its
rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Like Adolph Zukor, who vertically integrated production,
distribution and exhibition at Paramount back in the teens, Wasserman
attempted to integrate his agency and production with himself at the
fulcrum. Among the first to see the future of television, he created
a television arm of MCA to produce programs with the agency's
clients. That led to a much bigger gambit: MCA bought a controlling
interest in Universal-International. Though the Justice Department
decided that it was a conflict of interest for a talent agency to own
the studio that would employ its clients, thus forcing Wasserman to
divest himself of MCA, the moment was nevertheless symbolically
significant. It certified that talent and the studios were now
partners.</TE>
<TE>   This achievement would have been enough to engrave Wasserman's
name in movie history. But if Wasserman understood the exercise of
power, he also understood the importance of its style, especially for
an industry predicated on aesthetics, and he bequeathed that too. The
old moguls ruled with bluster and bombast. They were bulls. Wasserman
ruled with seigniorial coolness. He was a shark. He wore plain, dark
suits and trademark oversized horn-rim glasses that, along with his
perfectly coifed silver hair, gave him the appearance of a Wall
Street broker, though his detractors claimed that this hid a dark
side.</TE>
<TE>   His years in the rough-and-tumble of big bands and nightclubs,
they said, had put him in league with the nefarious forces of
organized crime, from whom he borrowed his tactics. Whether or not
Wasserman actually ruled like a Mafia don, he certainly cultivated
the impression that he did. He was secretive, seldom granting
interviews or seeking publicity. He would communicate with associates
by scribbling notes, sliding them across the table, then withdrawing
and crumpling them.</TE>
<TE>   It was said that men would tremble, even vomit, in his presence
just as it was said with one phone call Wasserman could move any
mountain, whether that call was to one of the mob fixers with whom he
allegedly worked or to the president of the United States.
Appropriately, his monument was anything but ostentatious--the
monolithic black tower in Universal City that was the physical
embodiment of the cold, implacable power Wasserman held.</TE>
<TE>   In part because it worked so well and in part because it seemed an
aesthetic improvement on the noisy fulminations of the old moguls,
nearly everyone in Hollywood was soon emulating the Wasserman manner
until it became the dominant executive style in the industry. At the
same time, it changed the culture of the industry. As Wasserman
achieved the status of gray eminence, the only man who had passed
into his dotage without surrendering his power, he consummated the
long journey of those first moguls--from buccaneers to businessmen,
from outsiders to insiders, from the disreputable to the
desirable--and the journey of the industry itself from a novelty to
arguably the most significant cultural force in the world. Through
Wasserman, Hollywood had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, this may have proved his undoing, because the success
of Hollywood attracted a power that not even Wasserman could trump:
the power of money. When Japanese industrial giant Matsushita bought
Universal in 1990, with Wasserman's blessing, he soon found himself
an employee rather than a eminence, and when Seagram bought Universal
from Matsushita five years later, reportedly without even informing
him beforehand, he was eased from his seat into de facto retirement.
Still, it was one of the longest runs in Hollywood, and it left an
enduring legacy--in the balance of power, in the way power is
exercised and in the power of the movies themselves.</TE>

<LD>The entertainment world's chronic malcontents are assembling this
week, which is generally not something that chronic malcontents do
often or particularly well.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, last year's planned installment of the biennial Writers
Guild Foundation's "Words Into Pictures" conference was postponed
until now, as the strike threat that loomed over the industry
fostered concern no self-respecting writer would want to sit on a
panel beside executive types.</LD>
<LD>   The truth is many of them probably still feel that way, but more
than 1,000 people are nevertheless expected to attend this year's
symposium in Universal City, which kicks off Friday and continues
through the weekend. If the schedule (available at www.wordsinto
pictures.org) is any indication, the event will provide writers
another chance to fret about Hollywood's preoccupation with the
bottom line, which has exacerbated feelings of contempt and
powerlessness toward the industry that employs them.</LD>
<TE>   The elements that mingle at "Words Into Pictures," however, are
more complex than that. Easily identifiable, for example, are
enterprising agents and managers, who roam the halls trying to poach
clients from competitors. Some talent reps pursue this aim subtly,
but others might as well be pushing a shopping cart.</TE>
<TE>   Aspiring writers, meanwhile, pay more than $500 (WGA members and
students receive a discount) to be told that they must persevere,
that they need to keep honing their craft, that there is a dire
shortage of talent out there, and that truly gifted writers will find
a way to penetrate the industry's barriers, no matter how firmly the
gates appear to be locked.</TE>
<TE>   The hunger in the air at such gatherings is palpable. After
moderating a "Words Into Pictures" session a few years ago, I was
chased halfway to the parking lot by an agitated fellow who was irate
that the talk didn't focus on how he, personally, could sell his
script. I have no doubt he is hunched over a computer somewhere,
clacking away between rants about how he created "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" in 1988 before some scoundrel stole it.</TE>
<TE>   Although the festivities are billed as a writers' forum, not a
how-to seminar, wannabes will always be drawn to such affairs seeking
their break, prompting the WGA to remind attendees not to pitch
material to the 175 panelists donating their time.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if the goals of those with their nose pressed against the
glass remain constant, the prevailing mood among gainfully employed
writers does appear grumpier than ever. What promises to be the
program's most intriguing panel, titled "The Writer as Subversive,"
underscores that mind-set, with a group of A-list scribes being asked
to discuss if it's possible to "do personally important work that
serves their conscience and pays the mortgage" in a business run by
global conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, writers have always had a love-hate relationship with
Hollywood, one that mostly involves loving its money and hating its
practices. Their sense of unease has mushroomed, however, as studio
moguls gave way to corporate muckety-mucks who speak of movies and TV
shows as "product" or "software" to feed their distribution
machinery.</TE>
<TE>   The guild remains so apprehensive about this shift that it
petitioned the government this year to reexamine rules on media
ownership, maintaining that the public has as much cause to fear
these media behemoths as writers do.</TE>
<TE>   Network executives are obligated to downplay such concerns, but
they have tacitly acknowledged that concentrating creative decisions
in too few hands might not be the wisest policy. ABC officials
admitted in hindsight that they may have overdosed on "synergy" by
letting network parent Disney's production unit supply 26 out of 30
new-series candidates for next season.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, NBC announced plans for autonomous "pods" to develop
programs--an attempt to nurture independent thinking in a business
environment that seems antithetical to the term.</TE>
<TE>   While it's hard to criticize companies for a commitment to profits
and stock prices (yes, AOL Time Warner shareholders, we feel your
pain), it's equally clear that "art" can't always be made to fit as
neatly as a Big Mac in its container. No wonder writers worry about
their role when the $100-million movie opening weekend has become a
reality, films are called "franchises," and it's rare to see less
than a half-dozen names affixed to a blockbuster screen- play.</TE>
<TE>   In television, by contrast, the writer--or more accurately, the
series creator-executive producer-"show runner"--sits atop the food
chain; still, because these demigods double as producers who employ
other writers, they often have little in common with their
less-exalted brethren.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, TV's own version of a fast-food strategy is taking root,
placing more emphasis on familiar titles and names to stand apart
from the din of competing channels. As a result, you'll see a fourth
series under the "Law &amp; Order" banner later this month and a "CSI"
spinoff this fall. While this approach ignores that TV's biggest hits
usually originate from unexpected sources, at least it provides
executives a built-in alibi when dealing with their corporate bosses,
allowing them to say, "Hey, we went with the guy who created 'The
Practice,' how did we know he was gonna mess things up?"</TE>
<TE>   These are all frequent laments among writers but thus far haven't
helped them convince the public that movies and TV would be
demonstrably better if creative types were afforded greater freedom.
Perhaps that explains why this weekend's conference will open with a
bit of science fiction, as a panel of writers ponder the concept
"It's Good to Be King: If I Ran the Industry."</TE>
<TE>   One can certainly understand why writers feel even more frustrated
and unappreciated than usual as they churn out "software" for Viacom
or News Corp. Yet as those inside the belly of the beast share their
war stories, it's worth remembering that they will be surrounded and
outnumbered by an army of those who view the battle from afar and,
for the most part, just want to know how to enlist.</TE>

<LD>   Despite Tony Award, 'Sweet Smell' Closing</LD>
<LD>   "Thoroughly Modern Millie" rang up $350,000 in ticket sales the
day after it won best musical at the Tony Awards Sunday night, double
its usual daily take. "Into the Woods," "Mamma Mia!," "Urinetown" and
best play winner "The Goat" also reported significant boosts as a
result of the TV exposure.</LD>
<TE>   But producers of the $10-million "Sweet Smell of Success," whose
John Lithgow was named best actor in a musical, have decided to call
it quits on June 15 after 108 performances and the loss of their
entire investment. Lithgow, who played J.J. Hunsecker, a vengeful
gossip columnist who makes and breaks careers, was the only winner
among the show's seven Tony nominations.</TE>
<TE>   The production, directed by Nicholas Hytner, had music and lyrics
by Marvin Hamlisch and Craig Carnelia and a book by John Guare. It
opened March 14 to generally negative notices and has struggled at
the box office ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts a lot when people dismiss it and ridicule it ... and I
would be lying if I said that didn't occasionally fill me with rage
and resentment," Lithgow said after his Tony triumph. "For all the
people who have hated the show, an equal number have loved it just as
passionately. Every critic who has reviewed it in a London newspaper
has raved about it. Go figure."</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie Moving Ahead Despite Ventura Veto</TE>
<TE>   The board of directors of Minneapolis' Guthrie Theater have
decided to continue design and pre-construction work on a new
$125-million theater along the Mississippi River, despite Gov. Jesse
Ventura's veto of $24 million in state funding, the Minneapolis Star
Tribune reports.</TE>
<TE>   Though the future of the project requires lining up $35 million
from Minnesota coffers, there is a ray of hope. Since his veto,
Ventura has indicated that he thought the proposal had merit and
indicated that he'd entertain a capital-projects bill in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   At best, there will be at least a six-month postponement on the
groundbreaking, which was expected to take place in September.</TE>

<TE>   Besson Questioned in Stuntman Death</TE>
<TE>   A judicial investigator questioned French film director Luc Besson
on Tuesday in connection with the death of a cameraman during a movie
stunt in 1999. The director of films such as "La Femme Nikita" and
"The Big Blue" was placed under official investigation, judiciary
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation--which under French law is a step short of
pressing charges and does not necessarily lead to trial--was prompted
by accusations that not enough money was spent on safety during the
shooting of "Taxi 2," which Besson produced. The movie--and the
original, "Taxi"--were huge box-office hits in France.</TE>
<TE>   Cameraman Alain Dutartre was killed and two camera crew members
were injured on the set when a stunt car launched over two tanks flew
past barriers intended to stop it. Stunt specialist Remy Julienne
accused Besson's production company of refusing to spring for a
remote-controlled camera.</TE>
<TE>   Besson denies the allegations, saying he followed all safety rules
and didn't cut corners on spending. He's already started work on
"Taxi 3," the next installment in the series.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Avery Fisher Hall Now, but Will It Stick?</TE>
<TE>   The Avery Fisher family plans to meet with officials at New York
City's Lincoln Center this week to warn them against changing the
name of the prestigious Avery Fisher Hall. The building is one of
seven on the campus due to be overhauled during a 10-year renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, an electronics mogul, gave $10.5 million in 1973 to
rebuild the acoustically flawed building, home to the New York
Philharmonic, on the condition that it be named after him in
perpetuity. The outcome of the dispute, analysts say, could set a
precedent for how philanthropists and cultural organizations
negotiate naming rights.</TE>
<TE>   "In perpetuity means forever, and if we have to go to court to
protect the name, we will," said Fisher family attorney William
Zabel.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln Center's president, Reynold Levy, said he hopes to settle
the matter amicably. But most of the funding for the $1-billion-plus
project, including an estimated $300 million for Avery Fisher Hall,
must come from private donors who like their names on things.</TE>
<TE>   The disagreement signals a shift in unwritten philanthropic
guidelines from the honorary system to a more binding one, notes
Harvard University professor Peter Frumkin told the Nando Times.
"Donors want recognition, and the gift has gone from being a gift to
being a contract," he said.</TE>

<HD>Acting on Instinct</HD>
<DH>The highly disciplined Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet, at Kodak
Theatre, asks its dancers to draw on psychological motivations as
they perform</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's special about the Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet, warns artist
director Dmitry Bryantsev, won't be evident at a class Monday night
in a Culver City studio.</LD>
<LD>   "You'll have 75 dancers arriving after a 12-hour flight from
Moscow," Bryantsev said, speaking through a translator. He had
arrived in Los Angeles a few days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   "They will be jet-lagged. My objective will be only one: On the
basis of classical exercises, to restore their stamina, to make them
normal. Everyone really will be in a state to dance the Mad Scene of
'Giselle.'"</LD>
<TE>   Actually, except for some rough terminations and more yawns than
might be expected, the company--Moscow's second major troupe, after
the Bolshoi--looked eager and ready to tackle "Don Quixote" and "Swan
Lake" today through Sunday at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Ballet coach Arkady Nikolaev took them through a standard hourlong
class, beginning with warmups at the barre, moving through
increasingly complicated combinations of steps and finishing with
space-devouring bounds and leaps in diagonals across the huge studio.</TE>
<TE>   So what is special about the company, which is making its Los
Angeles debut?</TE>
<TE>   Its full title gives away one element: The Ballet Company of the
Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Music Theater. That
would be Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko,
the two legendary founders of the Moscow Art Theater and what's
usually called method acting. The idea was to have the dancers draw
on the same sort of psychological motivation as actors.</TE>
<TE>   The present troupe was founded in 1941. Nemirovich-Danchenko
directed its first productions. Bryantsev is just the third artistic
director at the company; he took charge in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "We pay very special attention to acting and the dancers acting
while dancing," he said. "Everyone has to develop their character in
a deeper way. There's no unmotivated running from one corner to
another as so many other companies unfortunately do. People must
reveal the reason for what they do. There are no 'abstract' ballets
in our repertory.</TE>
<TE>   "My point of view is that I'm working in the most important art
form in the world because we have to show the inner emotion, which
sometimes is very deep, while dancing. It is like a surgeon's work.
We make a cut in the surface and reveal everything inside to the
public."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to their psychological approach, the company is also
bringing its own versions of classic repertory to Los Angeles: "Don
Quixote," as staged by Alexey Chichenadze, Moscow Stanlislavsky
Ballet director from 1971 to 1984, and the more radical 1953 staging
of "Swan Lake" by Vladimir Bourmeister, company director from 1941 to
1971.</TE>
<TE>   Bourmeister went back to Tchaikovsky's original 1877 score,
choreographed by Julius Reisinger in a version that did not survive.
It was not until choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov revived
the work, rearranging some of the music, for the MaryinskiTheatre in
St. Petersburg in 1895 that the ballet began to conquer the world.</TE>
<TE>   Bourmeister re-choreographed the entire ballet, except for Act II.
In keeping with his company's founding fathers, he gave all the
characters psychological motivations, and he made the divertissement
dancers in the third act co-conspirators with the evil forces set
against the hero and heroine. The U.S. first saw this company in this
version in 1998, when the Moscow Stanislavsky came to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "As a vibrant theatrical spectacle, it is all fire and ice," wrote
Anna Kisselgoff in the New York Times. "So many of Bourmeister's
ideas have seeped into other Russian and Western productions of 'Swan
Lake' that it is difficult to imagine the initial impact of his
rethinking of this 19th century classic. [His] third act may actually
improve on Petipa's character dances."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Louise Levene wrote in the London Sunday
Telegraph after the January tour that Bourmeister's restoration of
what's now known as the "Black Swan" pas de deux to its original
place in the first act was a mistake. "You can't help agreeing with
Petipa that the 'Black Swan' music is altogether too grand for Act
I," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Bryantsev refuses to tinker with the ballet as he
inherited it.</TE>
<TE>   "I never intrude into others' work," he said. "That would be like
painting another kind of eyebrow for the Mona Lisa, simply because a
new kind of eyebrow is in fashion today.</TE>
<TE>   His troupe, which has 165 dancers including an orchestra, is based
in a 1,300-seat municipal theater that is state supported. It dances
18 performances a month on an 11-month schedule, according to
Bryantsev.</TE>
<TE>   "Each time, it is a full house," he said. "If a company has
problems, it's because the repertory is not interesting enough."</TE>
<TE>   He tries to limit touring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm deeply aware that when you have many tours, it's bad for the
company in terms of its wear and tear on the dancers. We must always
be in good professional form. You have to find the golden middle."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the troupe's schedule looks pretty filled. After Los
Angeles, the company will dance in Denver and Salt Lake City, then go
back to Moscow. Tours to England in December, Japan in April and
China in mid-summer are also on the books.</TE>
<TE>   In all of that, he has to schedule time for creating his own
works. "I myself have something to say with my original ballets. I
have many works for the future. Why collude with something that's
already been done?" Indeed, Bryantsev is regarded as "Russia's
leading contemporary dance-maker," according to Jenny Gilbert,
writing in London's Independent in December. But only one of his
works, "The Ghostly Ball," is on the current tour (it was danced at
the gala opening Tuesday).</TE>
<TE>   Bryantsev is a little miffed about that. He would like to bring
more of his works.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to pay tribute to the most treasured classics," he said.
"At the same time, our contemporaries can't live and see only these
ballets. But when impresarios look to the East, they want those
ballets that are only classical. When they look to the West, they
invite only modern companies. They are thinking in terms of success.
But I would like to bring my biblical ballets--"Sulamith," from "The
Song of Solomon," and "Salome"--and "La Dame aux Camelias" as well as
"Swan Lake" to show the level of the company. That would be very
interesting."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet will dance "Don Quixote" today at 8
p.m. and Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. at the Kodak Theatre, 6801
Hollywood Blvd. The company will dance "Swan Lake" on Friday at 8
p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. $32 to $72. (213) 480-3232.</TE>

<HD>Looking for Tanks Sunk on D-Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"D-Day: Beneath the Waves," which airs tonight on the Discovery
Channel, explores one of the lingering mysteries of June 6, 1944, as
a way to reexamine those early-morning hours of bravery and death.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery centers on a "secret" weapon devised by the Allies:
30-ton Sherman tanks equipped with propellers and disguised with
canvas so they could swim ashore from boats and then provide covering
fire for troops assaulting Hitler's heavily fortified Atlantic Wall.</LD>
<LD>   At Utah and Sword beaches, the strategy worked beautifully.</LD>
<TE>   But 27 of 29 tanks launched 6,000 yards from Omaha Beach sank
almost immediately, leaving troops trapped in the rolling surf and
barb-wired beach and vulnerable to withering machine-gun fire from
German soldiers on the bluffs above.</TE>
<TE>   Underwater archeologist and former U.S. Army tank driver Brett
Phaneuf was determined to find an answer to the failure of the 741st
tank battalion. He searched the sea bottom with a camera-equipped,
remote-operated vehicle to find the sunken Shermans and also combed
through British and American war records.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing quite like a tank, Phaneuf explains: "It's like
testosterone cast in steel."</TE>
<TE>   The mystery may be a slight one, and Phaneuf's conclusion hardly
surprising, but the success of "Beneath the Waves" lies elsewhere: in
vivid re-creations that rival those of "Saving Private Ryan,"
interviews with American, British and German veterans, and an
overview of the longest day that buffs and novices alike will find
instructive.</TE>
<TE>   A former German infantryman tells of manning one of the machine
gun nests and looking through the fog in disbelief to see that "the
whole horizon was full of ships."</TE>
<TE>   As "Beneath the Waves" notes, there were other foul-ups that
morning: aerial bombardment that missed its target, paratroopers who
were dropped miles from their rallying points. With 6,000 ships,
175,000 troops and a daring, complex plan of attack, miscues were to
be expected.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the soldiers of the 741st felt a particular sense of
failure, which remains largely undiminished by decades.</TE>
<TE>   "We all had a sense of shame that we didn't do what we were sent
out there to do," says one veteran. "I'm sure we could have saved a
lot of men," says another.</TE>
<TE>   "Beneath the Waves" makes a strong case that the 741st had no
reason for shame and that the GIs struggled bravely against
unforeseen circumstances that doomed their mission from the start.</TE>
<TE>   There are no plans to raise the tanks. They remain at the bottom
of the English Channel, the narrator says, "unique monuments to men
and women who gave their lives to that great crusade."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "D-Day: Beneath the Waves" airs at 9 tonight on the Discovery
Channel.</TE>

<HD>'42nd St.,' Lily Tomlin Set for Ahmanson</HD>
<DH>Theater* 'Mamma Mia!' 'Bring in 'Da Funk' are also on the
schedule, and a recent Broadway drama is being sought as well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lily Tomlin and "42nd Street" will join "The Producers" and one
additional non-musical play, yet to be determined, to make up the
2002-2003 season at the Ahmanson Theatre, producer-artistic director
Gordon Davidson said Tuesday. He also announced a brief return of
"Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk," starring Savion Glover.</LD>
<LD>   Tomlin will return to Los Angeles in a May 21-July 6, 2003 run of
"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe," her solo
show written and directed by Jane Wagner. The odyssey of intertwined
stories, as related by a bag lady, played the Doolittle Theatre in
1986 and the Wilshire Theatre in 1990. A slightly rewritten version
appeared at Orange County Performing Arts Center in 1999, landed on
Broadway in the 2000-2001 season, and recently played San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The touring company of the recent Broadway production of the
Depression-set backstage musical "42nd Street," which won the best
musical revival Tony in 2001, will visit the Ahmanson July 11-Aug.
31, 2003. Mark Bramble, who co-wrote the movie-inspired book of the
tap-heavy 1980 musical about a chorine who becomes a star, directed
the Broadway revival and will stage the tour.</LD>
<TE>   The season's non-musical entry, slated for December 2002, will be
selected from the recent Broadway productions of "The Crucible,"
"Fortune's Fool" and "Morning's at Seven," Davidson said. On Sunday,
Alan Bates and Frank Langella won Tony Awards for their performances
in Turgenev's "Fortune's Fool," but the casting in L.A. would not
necessarily match that of Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson said the three shows are not currently scheduled to tour
but that he is trying to arrange a special Ahmanson appearance of one
of the shows that would resemble the Broadway staging as closely as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Ahmanson will be bringing in two other "bonus"
shows as part of its season: the previously announced return of
"Mamma Mia!" to L.A., Sept. 19-Nov. 3, 2002, and a revival of "Bring
in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk," Jan. 28-Feb. 9, 2003, that will
feature Glover, the tap musical's original star and choreographer.
Glover's role was played by Derick K. Grant during the show's
previous Ahmanson run in 1998. Ahmanson and Mark Taper Forum
subscribers will get a chance to buy tickets prior to the general
public. As previously announced, the biggest ticket on the Ahmanson
list, "The Producers," will play the larger Pantages Theatre in
Hollywood, not the Ahmanson. The Ahmanson subscribers' dates for the
musical are June 1-Aug. 24, 2003. Subscribers to the Pantages'
resident group Broadway L.A. also will receive "The Producers" as
part of their subscriptions, May 6-June 1.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson said that this year's crop of possible musicals for the
Ahmanson was "slim pickings." However, "I have seven or eight
musicals to choose from for the following season"--among them, the
Tony-winning "Thoroughly Modern Millie" and the revival of
"Oklahoma!" Regarding the Tony-winning "Urinetown, the Musical,"
Davidson said it "belongs in a smaller theater" than the Ahmanson.
But a "Urinetown" tour is expected in L.A. at some point in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson tried to put together two home-grown productions for the
Ahmanson's next season, he said. One of them, which he would identify
only as a play from around 1900, was delayed because the desired
actress was not available. The other, a large-cast classic that he
also declined to name, was deemed unaffordable when a co-producer or
another booking could not be found. However, Davidson said the gap in
the Ahmanson bookings between "Noise/Funk" in February and Tomlin's
show in May could yet be filled--although any such production would
be a bonus option, not a component of the subscription season.</TE>

<LD>Thursday: A reconstruction of Harry Smith's bizarre four-screen film
"Mahagonny," in which Kurt Weill's opera "The Rise and Fall of the
City of Mahagonny" is reinterpreted through scenes of '70s New York,
is screened for the first time at the Getty Center.</LD>
<LD>   Friday: A daylong symposium at the Getty explores Smith's
"Mahagonny," concluding in the evening with a concert by Patti Smith
(who makes an appearance in the film). The same evening, an opera
singer, Angelina Reaux, who made a name for herself a decade ago as a
riveting Weill interpreter, directs and stars in a small but striking
production of "The Threepenny Opera" in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday: As a break from the Ojai Festival survey of late Beethoven
and Shostakovich string quartets, popular cabaret singer Ute Lemper
makes a rare daylight appearance for a morning recital that revolves
around Bertolt Brecht and Weill. A typical Weill weekend? Maybe not,
but everywhere you look, there are traces of the composer.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, the blockbuster Andy Warhol show at the Museum of
Contemporary Art has everyone talking about the merging of high and
low and about how art images brand themselves. Yes, of course, Warhol
gave the visual art world a shock of the new. But Kurt was there long
before Andy.</TE>
<TE>   The Doors sang, "Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar" in
the '60s; Brecht and Weill wrote it in 1927. When Bobby Darin put
"Mack the Knife" on the hit parade in the late '50s, it was just one
more example of the groundbreaking Brecht-Weill high-low breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   Even a connection between Warhol and Weill is not farfetched. I
can imagine the young Andy, a hustling fashion illustrator, as a
small character in Weill's Broadway hit "Lady in the Dark," a musical
about a fashion magazine editor. (Had Warhol been in it, by the way,
he would have seen Stravinsky and Richard Rodgers jostling each other
backstage, trying to be the first to congratulate the composer on
opening night.) Yet another connection: Lou Reed--who rose to stardom
as a member of the Warhol-linked rock band Velvet Underground--once
recorded a curiously credible version of "September Song" from
another Weill show.</TE>
<TE>   The range of Weill interpreters may be unprecedented. At one
extreme, worn-out German rock singer Nina Hagen makes a startling
appearance on a terrific recent recording of "The Threepenny Opera,"
conducted by noted Viennese composer HK Gruber. At another,
mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter and early music specialist John
Eliot Gardiner made a not-bad Weill recording several years ago that
included "Seven Deadly Sins." I happen to have a fondness for
Marianne Faithfull's not unfaithful version of it.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, under every musical stone seems to lurk a Weillian. David
Atherton, artistic director of the Mainly Mozart Festival that that
got underway in San Diego over the weekend, has a first-rate recent
recording of the two Weill symphonies. On the other hand, you can
also hear Weill's influence on songs in recent albums by Bob Dylan,
Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and Patti Smith.</TE>
<TE>   But for all that, it is still possible to get Weill wrong. And sad
to say, the past Weill weekend was more travesty than tribute,
beginning with the wrongheaded restoration of Harry Smith's film.</TE>
<TE>   Avant-garde filmmaker, alchemist, artist, folk-music
ethnomusicologist, oddball collector and who-knows-what-else Smith
made "Mahagonny" because of his obsession with the opera. He
apparently listened to it endlessly in his room at the Chelsea Hotel
and then came up with a half-cocked idea that he might make a film of
the opera based upon an elaborate mathematical analysis he undertook
of Marcel Duchamp's most famous work, "The Bride Stripped Bare by Her
Bachelors, Even," which is etched on a large glass. The connection is
vague at best, although Duchamp's "Large Glass," as the work is
sometimes known, and the city of Mahagonny represent sex machines of
sorts.</TE>
<TE>   What is interesting about Smith's film--which uses the 1956
recording of the opera, with Lotte Lenya, as its soundtrack--is not
the imagery or the elaborate structure. The shots of Manhattan 30
years ago and of underground celebrities (notably Allen Ginsberg) in
Smith's room are enjoyable enough, as is the homemade animation that
uses cigarettes, toys, drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The most original aspect of the project is that Smith intended the
film as a "performance" of the opera. He hoped to present it as four
films projected on pool tables set up in a boxing ring (the
"Mahagonny-Songspiel," Brecht and Weill's experimental predecessor to
the opera, was staged in a boxing ring). That never happened, but it
was first screened in New York "live" on four screens, the operators
syncing four 16-millimeter projectors as best they could. Smith
accompanied the film with his own reel-to-reel tape dub of the opera
LPs.</TE>
<TE>   The restoration includes professional synchronization of the films
to a terrible digital version of the original recording. At the
Getty, it was played at high volume, as if it were a John Williams
score meant for a summer blockbuster. The recorded performance was
highly flawed in the first place, and here sounded grating,
unmusical, untrue to Smith and Weill. Each element, the four films
and soundtrack, needs independence, a life of its own, not slick
synchronization.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that, in making the restoration, the Harry Smith
Archives now have the original materials in good shape, and a true
performance of the film is a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   In a very different way, Lemper also killed Weill with too much
slickness. There are some who enjoy her shtick (she had many in the
Ojai crowd Sunday morning asking for more). That she is not a very
good singer is not necessarily a deadly sin with Weill (we have Lenya
as the model for that). That she turns every deliciously cynical
phrase into something cute, however, is a very great one. Her
accompanist was classical guitarist Eliot Fisk, whose strumming along
was a musical non sequitur.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, the Weill that felt like Weill--raw, nasty, full of
deep meaning--was found in the most modest of the weekend's
enterprises. In Victoria Hall, a Santa Barbara church converted into
a small theater, Reaux offered a startling re-creation of "The
Threepenny Opera," in the English adaptation by Marc Blitzstein.
There were no sets. The cast looked like a kinky cross between the
Addams Family and the Simpsons.</TE>
<TE>   Baritone Michael Sokol was a fine Macheath. Reaux was a hilarious
Mrs. Peachum. The rest of the cast was vocally uneven. There was a
not very good four-piece band. But every number was staged in the
audience's face, and a very familiar work shocked and stunned all
over again.</TE>
<TE>   Reaux, who came to Weill fame with a show she did in New York in
the early '90s, "Stranger Here Myself," has been little-seen of late
(her last major local appearance was singing "Seven Deadly Sins" at
the Ojai Festival seven years ago). She is still as strikingly
effective and original a singer as she has always been. Now she shows
a real talent for direction.</TE>
<TE>   After the show, Santa Barbara had suddenly turned cold and misty.
It was exactly the right atmosphere for "Threepenny Opera." There was
no question that Weill was in the air that dark night.</TE>

<HD>N. Korean Famine an Open Wound</HD>

<LD>A 5-year-old child who has learned to smoke a cigarette with all the
mannerisms of an adult while hiding with his parents in an
underground shelter is one of the heart-wrenching faces that
"Nightline" puts to the ongoing famine crisis in North Korea, in a
three-part series of reports starting tonight (11:35 p.m., ABC).</LD>
<LD>   Like an estimated 100,000 refugees, his parents fled repressive
North Korea to China, where they had a better chance of finding food.
But a shelter in the woods is no place for his newborn sibling, who
is given up for adoption, nor for his older sisters, who must go to
school. So the girls are sent to an orphanage and the boy soon
follows, the cameras following the tear-filled separation from the
parents.</LD>
<LD>   The scenes were captured by freelance journalist Kim Jung-eun, a
South Korean who recorded the story and others in five visits to
China from March 1999 through April 2000. Her resulting film,
"Shadows and Whispers," which "Nightline" has adapted, offers a rare
personal glimpse into the world of the illegal refugees, who have
more recently been in the news for storming diplomatic compounds in
China hoping to find asylum in hospitable countries.</LD>
<TE>   One woman talks about the guilt she feels because "I gave birth to
my child but I never had the chance to feed my child a bowl of rice."
Instead, the child, who is left behind at age 4 when the parents
escape to China, got a gruel made of grass and flour.</TE>
<TE>   The series' third night tells the story of children who live on
the streets, smuggling money back to their families in North Korea in
plastic-wrapped wads that they swallow.</TE>
<TE>   Kim's affecting film has previously aired on Australian television
and at film festivals, winning numerous top awards, but the
"Nightline" showing is its American television premiere.</TE>

<LD>Rights to NBA basketball shift to ABC next season, but NBC is going
out with a bang, scoring its highest basketball rating in four
years--since Michael Jordan's last trip to the NBA Finals--with the
Lakers' overtime victory over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday, based
on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Not only did NBC benefit from Sunday's nail-biting finish, but the
Lakers' victory bodes well for the NBA Finals, putting a franchise
from the U.S.' second-biggest city back in the championship series.
The Los Angeles TV market is more than four times the size of
Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto, the 19th-largest media market.</LD>
<LD>   Because Game 7 ran until past 10 p.m. in the Eastern time zone,
the Lakers doubtless contributed to poor ratings for this year's Tony
Awards, which slipped 11% from last year's Nielsen level. ABC
generated so-so tune-in for its "reality miniseries," "The Hamptons,"
while Fox also garnered modest ratings with the premiere of "Looking
for Love: Bachelorettes in Alaska." Both performed best among younger
women.</LD>
<TE>   Among cable fare, TLC scored a coup with strong Memorial Day
numbers for its breakthrough hit "Trading Spaces," while HBO's "Six
Feet Under" closed its season on a solid note with 5.5 million
viewers, although viewing dropped by a third for the debut of the pay
channel's new drama "The Wire."</TE>

<LD>On the eve of a two-month, multi-city journey, the mind of John
Cleese whirs with varied and sundry preoccupations. Among them is the
plight of the lemurs. Yes, really. On Sunday, he christened the San
Francisco Zoo's new exhibit of the animals.</LD>
<LD>   His clipped British accent, familiar as a voice of incisive, dry
wit, turns tender as he speaks of the "half monkey, half cat" species
threatened by deforestation in Madagascar. "They're just the cutest
little critters on God's earth, extraordinarily good-natured," Cleese
said by phone from his home in Santa Barbara. "But not very bright."</LD>
<LD>   Cleese fell in love with the creatures as a boy growing up in
Bristol, England. He lived near a zoo and would visit regularly to
feed them. In his 1997 film "Fierce Creatures," a ring-tailed lemur
was cast in a starring role. Around the same time, Cleese raised
enough money to release five black and white ruffed lemurs that had
been bred in captivity into the rain forests of Madagascar in the
hopes that they would reproduce and multiply. In 1998, he and a
documentary crew trekked to the island off Africa to check on their
progress. "One of them had a girlfriend," Cleese recalled. "And there
were signs of fraternizing."</LD>
<TE>   These days, however, Cleese's adventures are relatively domestic.
From San Francisco, he was off to collect awards in Canada (from the
Banff Television Festival) and in Washington, D.C. (from the
Smithsonian). "I'm getting so old now that people are giving me
awards before I die," quipped the 62-year-old. Later this month, he's
on to London to unveil a plaque at Sigmund Freud's house and shoot
scenes for the next "Harry Potter" film as Nick the Nearly Headless
Ghost. "And the rest," he says, "is all trivia."</TE>
<TE>   Summer Wear</TE>
<TE>   for QVC Benefit</TE>
<TE>   Guests arrived early in their summer gear--linen shirts, straw
hats and sunglasses all around--and quickly clustered into groups on
the manicured lawns of a Malibu estate. Although the gray skies
didn't burn off until noon, soap stars and socialites strolled
between tents on the greenery, pausing to pick up lemonade and
long-stemmed strawberries while the Pacific Ocean winked behind them.</TE>
<TE>   At QVC's "Cure by the Shore" benefit on Saturday to raise money
for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Adam Sandler was one of
the last to arrive. Hours after the party started, Sandler cruised in
wearing torn gray sweatpants, a T-shirt and unlaced Nikes. After
looking at the swarms of flowered skirts and polo shirts on the other
guests, he bent over to posh himself up by tying his shoes. While
posing for pictures, Tom Sherak, chief executive of the Multiple
Sclerosis Society, grumbled good-naturedly about Sandler's late
appearance. "You told me 1 o'clock," Sandler said. "Yeah," replied
Sherak. "Did you think I meant 1 a.m.?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on Hawaiian time," Sandler said before sheepishly admitting
to a friend, "I didn't set my alarm--I thought I'd be able to wake up
on my own."</TE>
<TE>   Later, "Young and the Restless" star Don Diamont, the QVC host,
pulled Cuba Gooding Jr. aside to welcome him. The two men were on
live television when Diamont went into Jiminy Glick mode, throwing an
arm around Gooding and saying how much he'd loved him in "Men in
Black." "Uh, that wasn't me," Gooding said. The host waited a beat
before joking that he'd really blown that one.</TE>
<TE>   The event's bottom line was no joke at all: The benefit raised
more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The South</TE>
<TE>   in Westwood</TE>
<TE>   Limos and fans lined the block as the sun set over the movie
premiere capital of the world--Westwood. It was Monday night and the
lull between Laker playoff games drew scores of college students and
autograph hounds hungry to connect with Ashley Judd, Sandra Bullock
and Ellen Burstyn. The Delta blues echoed off nearby storefronts, an
attempt by event planners to bring some Deep South authenticity to
the premiere of "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," a film
about Southern women set in Louisiana. But the stereo system wasn't
powerful enough to drown out the strains of Los Angeles, which
included two hovering news helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   On the red carpet, a woman with a video camera asked producer
Bonnie Bruckheimer if she believed in a higher power. "We need to be
kinder to each other," the producer said. Director Callie Khouri told
a reporter she was keeping her fingers crossed to direct a "Harry
Potter" film. Meanwhile, Judd chastised a journalist for asking vague
questions. "Be like her," she said, pointing to another reporter.
"Ask me about my earrings."  Bullock offered the evening's most
astute summation of the scene. "Premieres, to me, are like
non-reality."</TE>

<LD>When Daniel was 6 weeks old, his drug-addicted mother left him and
his two older brothers with her parents after she was arrested on
suspicion of child neglect. Then she disappeared from their lives.
Because he was a "drug baby," Daniel suffered from twitches and
tremors until the first grade.</LD>
<LD>   "I sent him to kindergarten, and the teachers asked 'What could we
do?'" said his grandmother, Christina Marshall, 57, who cares for the
child with her husband, Patrick, a 58-year-old trucker. "I said, 'Put
your arms around him, hold him tight, make him feel secure.' And the
shaking would stop."</LD>
<LD>   Though the twitches are less frequent, Daniel, now a teenager,
still has to work twice as hard to get through school. "He is in
special ed because it takes a long time for him to finish his
schoolwork," said Salvation Army social-service aide Cindy Silvers.
"Special ed can be a stigma, but at camp he's not a special-ed kid.
He's just Daniel, a 13-year-old boy."</LD>
<TE>   Since he was 7, Daniel has spent five days each summer at Camp
Gilmore in Malibu, thanks to a Salvation Army program for
underprivileged children. This year, the camp program received a
$160,000 donation from the Los Angeles Times Summer Camp Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   His grandmother said camp has enabled Daniel to overcome his
insecurity and clingy dependence on her. "He had tears in his eyes"
when he first left for camp from their El Monte home. When she
arrived an hour early to pick him up at the session's end, she found
a much more outgoing boy. "He was jabbering with other kids ... and
as he ran by, I pulled on his shirt and said, 'Excuse me?'" Marshall
said, laughing. "He had learned a lot of independence."</TE>
<TE>   This was a different Daniel who as an infant had to sleep in an
incubator because he had severe jaundice. His grandparents would
"sneak him out at night so he could sleep with us," Christina
Marshall said. "We'd touch his little nose, and he had the most
beautiful curly hair. We probably shouldn't have taken him out, but
he needed to form that bond."</TE>
<TE>   Now that he's a teenager in baggy clothes, Silvers calls him a
contradiction. "He looks kind of gang-bangy, he's into skateboarding.
But he's very loving and respectful of his grandmother." Camp Gilmore
Program Director Jim Sparks said style doesn't matter at camp. It is
"not like in school, where all the kids are grouped together based on
dress ... here it doesn't matter." In between rope-climbing courses
like the "leap of faith" (where campers jump off a pole and try to
grab onto a trapeze), swimming, and hiking, everyone seems to be on
equal footing. Well, almost.</TE>
<TE>   "It is always the tough, tough kids who have the roughest time
with the long hikes," Sparks said. "They start out saying, 'Man, I
hike all the time.'" Once he gets them on a long hike, though, they
quickly shed their bravado.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel said he is looking forward to the new challenges when he
goes to Wilderness Camp this summer, but he still remembers how hard
it was the first year, when he got into a fight with other campers.
After talking to a leader, Daniel talked to the boys, "and they
started to be my friend. I saw them last year, and it was cool." It
is easier for everyone to get along at the camp, according to Daniel,
because they have to do more things as a group.</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer, thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year. The average cost of sending a child to camp
for a week is $150. This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will
match the first $1.2 million in contributions at 50 cents on the
dollar.</TE>

<HD>Take the Heat--and the 40 Bucks</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Occasionally, when the gods of baseball frown down upon you, and the
first furnace blasts of summer blow across the infield, you will be
called upon to umpire a Little League game. Go ahead. It's only your
life we're talking about.</LD>
<LD>   "Wanna make 40 bucks?" the league commissioner asks.</LD>
<LD>   "Does it involve any nudity?"</LD>
<TE>   "That's up to you," he says.</TE>
<TE>   See, apparently a guy can lead a somewhat virtuous life, pay the
bills, find the door to church now and then. He can feed the dog,
keep the lawn looking like Augusta and do all sorts of other good
fatherly deeds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he will be called on to umpire, to enter sports'
most-select purgatory in nothing but a T-shirt and a pair of
Reagan-era shorts. My advice? Go for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a little broom," says the commissioner, a lovely man
with a lawyer's smile.</TE>
<TE>   "A broom?"</TE>
<TE>   "To brush off home plate," he says, holding the whisk broom like a
bouquet.</TE>
<TE>   Over at the other field, the scheduled umpire has failed to show
up, leaving a playoff game without anyone to call balls and strikes.
As we pack up from our own game, the commissioner comes to us for
volunteers. In the suburbs, it's how heroes are born.</TE>
<TE>   "You wanna do it?" I ask Bill, my assistant coach, who's a
risk-taker by nature but in this case mumbles something about having
to shave his back.</TE>
<TE>   "How about you?" I ask Steve, another assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "Only at gunpoint," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty bucks," says the commissioner again.</TE>
<TE>   Now, to a lot of people in Los Angeles, 40 bucks is a valet tip.
So there's this smirking assumption that I don't need the 40 bucks or
that I am too proud to take it. Boy, are they wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Cash?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," says the commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "When do I see the money?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   Because here's another thing about Los Angeles: You always demand
the money upfront. Just ask Spielberg or Katzenberg. Ask any of the
Bergs. In L.A., you get the money upfront or you don't get it at all.
It's part of the culture. Like fake lips or Valium.</TE>
<TE>   And so far, all I've seen is this lousy whisk broom and a cheap
plastic umpire's clicker. I want my 40 bucks.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, where's the 40?" I yell as the commissioner walks away.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll never see the 40," Coach Bill assures me.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me about it," I say.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I reach the field, there's already a dispute. The game
hasn't even started, and the coaches are arguing over something to do
with the stolen-base rule.</TE>
<TE>   I stand there listening to the argument, pretending this is the
most important issue since the Oslo accords.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a raise," I tell the commissioner after 20 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Who said anything about money?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   Then he gives me tips on my strike zone, which is a little
personal, really. Strike zones are like fingerprints or hairlines.
Every umpire's is different.</TE>
<TE>   "Not too high," the commissioner says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah yeah yeah," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Or too low," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen," I finally say. "I don't like to get locked into
definitions."</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever," the commissioner says, and just walks away again, late
for his pedicure and massage.</TE>
<TE>   The game goes well. Since I don't have umpire's gear, I call it
from behind the pitcher's mound. Fortunately, there are only a couple
of close plays that threaten to escalate into World War III.</TE>
<TE>   The coaches bark at me, then at each other, then at their players.
It's like open-mike night at the psych ward, except there is less
medication available and no one is standing by with stun guns. On
deck, a little girl waits to bat.</TE>
<TE>   "Play ball!" I finally say.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally," says the pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, finally," says the catcher.</TE>
<TE>   I bear down early in the game because I'm a little nervous and
don't want to rile the crowd or seem incompetent, though that's never
really been a big concern of mine.</TE>
<TE>   "Good call, ump," the little shortstop says at one point.</TE>
<TE>   "Shows what you know," I say, and she actually winks at me.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the third inning I relax a little, and my strike zone
starts to move. It's the worst thing in umpiring, this floating
strike zone. No one seems to notice.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth inning, my mucous membranes dry up in the afternoon
heat, and I begin thinking about the upcoming Tyson fight.</TE>
<TE>   I think about how I have to reserve 16 seats at the sports bar for
my knucklehead friends and their knucklehead sons. It will be a
knucklehead evening, dedicated to knuckleheads everywhere, including
Tyson himself. Between pitches, I laugh a little.</TE>
<TE>   "Water?" asks Coach Brian after the inning is over.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, the other team does not accuse him of a bribe.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth inning, the shimmering heat makes me a little woozy.
My fingers curl as if holding a beer.</TE>
<TE>   I begin to dream about retirement and a little fishing spot near a
cool creek, where I'll catch brook trout and the occasional
freshwater mermaid.</TE>
<TE>   "Strike three!" I blurt out at one point. " ... Or is that four?"</TE>
<TE>   "Good call," says the shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Brian, noticing that my spinal cord has collapsed, pours
water on my head as if hosing down a hot radiator.</TE>
<TE>   "He OK?" I hear a parent ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Just dizzy," someone answers.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do they get these guys?" another parent asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the money?" I mumble.</TE>
<TE>   If you ever get tapped to be an umpire, here are three things to
remember:</TE>
<TE>   * Invariably, there will be some rule dispute over an issue that
comes up only once every 150 years.</TE>
<TE>   * At some point, you will forget the ball-and-strike count while
thinking about a margarita and the good-looking scorekeeper, who's
45, old enough to be your mother. Wait, you're 45. Never mind.</TE>
<TE>   * With the winning run on third, a line drive will threaten to
drill you in the private place.</TE>
<TE>   Other than that, umpiring is great exercise and a terrific way to
make a little extra cash.</TE>
<TE>   I recommend it to anybody.</TE>

<HD>Renegade Eagle Has Landed</HD>
<DH>Show will display $6-million, storied coin. Next stop:
auction block.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been called the Holy Grail of coin collecting, and behind it
lies a tale of a teetering American economy, international relations
and a mysterious disappearance.</LD>
<LD>   This 1933 Double Eagle--its worth estimated at up to $6 million,
some say more--will soon become the only coin of its kind to be owned
legally. The rare $20 gold coin, which never made it into circulation
as legal tender, will be on display Thursday through Sunday at the
Long Beach Coin &amp; Collectibles Expo. In July, it will be jointly
auctioned by Sotheby's and coin-seller Stack's in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a big buzz all over the world," says Ronald J. Gillio,
general chairman of the expo. "Everyone in the coin business is
talking about it."</LD>
<TE>   People outside the business are talking as well. "The thing about
this coin," says David Tripp, Sotheby's special consultant and author
of the auction catalog, "is you don't have to be a coin collector to
be intrigued. It's almost a one-coin collection."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 500,000 Double Eagles, so called because they were double
the value of the $10 Eagle coin, were produced in 1933 using a design
created by the late American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. But
they were never put into circulation because, in an effort to lift
the economy from the Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took
the country off the gold standard. So the coins sat in vaults.</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, U.S. Mint cashier George McCann sent two of the coins to
the Smithsonian's numismatic collection. Three years later, all the
remaining coins were melted into bullion. Or so it was thought.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, a Chicago-based company called Smith &amp; Son ran an
advertisement in the Numismatist magazine featuring two coins, one of
them a 1933 Double Eagle, which is 90% gold, 10% copper. It would be
three more years, however, before the government acted. During the
next decade, nine 1933 Double Eagles were either seized or
surrendered. But there was at least one remaining. This one belonged
to King Farouk of Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   The king, a voracious collector of coins and other ephemera,
imported the coin legally in 1944. He was given permission by the
U.S. Treasury. Weeks later, however, the government realized its
error. This was, after all, stolen property, just like the other
recovered coins. There was talk of requesting the coin's return. A
letter was drafted, but never sent. Diplomatic relations were too
important. Nothing was done.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, King Farouk was ousted. Sotheby's was enlisted by the new
republic to auction off his property, which included more than 8,500
coins, among them the 1933 Double Eagle. When the U.S. government
learned of the sale, it requested the Double Eagle be withdrawn and
returned to the U.S. Treasury. The coin was withdrawn, then it
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, a well-known London coin dealer named Stephen Fenton was
arrested at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel trying to sell a 1933
Double Eagle. He claimed he purchased it from an Egyptian seller with
ties to one of the colonels who helped overthrow Farouk, and that it
was, in fact, the Farouk coin. (This pedigree, however, cannot be
100% verified, Tripp points out.)</TE>
<TE>   The coin was seized, then followed five years of legal wrangling
between Fenton and the U.S. government. Eventually, the two parties
arrived at a settlement: The government would retain ownership, but
the coin would be sold with the two parties sharing the profit.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever purchases the 1933 Double Eagle at the July 30 auction
will have to write two checks, one for the purchase price and one to
the U.S. government for $20 (the coin's monetary value), thus keeping
government books balanced.</TE>
<TE>   According to Henrietta Holsman Fore, director of the U.S. Mint,
the government's half of the take will go into the U.S. Treasury. "It
goes back to the people, which is great," she says. "It might help
the war on terrorism possibly." Another mint executive said the funds
will be used to reduce the national debt. And Fenton? "It's like he's
going to get a big tax rebate," offers Tripp.</TE>
<TE>   As to whether there are other 1933 Double Eagles in existence,
aside from the two at the Smithsonian: "There may well be. There may
not be," says Tripp. "There have been rumors for years. I have asked
[the government], 'What if another pops up?' Their answer has been
unequivocal. 'It is illegal to own and we will seize it.'"</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the official "Bill of Sale and Transfer Title" that
will go to the winning bidder "certifies that the subject coin is
genuine and is the only 1933 dated $20 Double Eagle authorized to be
issued."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty serious document," Tripp says.</TE>
<TE>   "Arguably, the piece of paper is worth more than the coin."</TE>
<TE>   When the 34-millimeter-wide coin is unveiled Thursday morning, it
will be protected by a bullet-proof glass housing, U.S. Mint police
and possibly Secret Service agents, says Gillio.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an ordinary coin with an extraordinary story," Tripp says.
"It has international pizazz."</TE>

<HD>Driven to Enlighten</HD>
<DH>S.N. Goenka tours the U.S. teaching a technique of silent
sitting to relieve anxiety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The guru is in his RV, gently swaying and bouncing in his tan
armchair (seat belt fastened!), offering sage words on Buddhist
teachings, enlightenment, and how to cope with road rage.</LD>
<LD>   A small, round Indian man with bushy salt and pepper eyebrows and
a wise, kind face, 79-year-old S.N. Goenka has attained a kind of
rock-star status among meditation groupies. They swear his 10-day
sessions of sitting without speaking can drive fear from the heart
and calm anxiety in the deepest recesses of the mind.</LD>
<LD>   Now the meditation guru, who lives in Bombay, is on a road trip,
crisscrossing the United States and Canada for four months in his
immense, 37-foot-long, beige and brown Pace Arrow.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday morning at the tail end of rush hour, Goenkaji (the "ji"
suffix denotes affection and respect in Hindi) is setting out from
the Burmese monastery Bhrama Vihara in Azusa for a tour of the Museum
of Tolerance in West L.A. From there he and his entourage, consisting
of his wife, his cook, his secretary, a documentarian and several
devoted Vipassana teachers, will continue their 35-city North
American tour, "Meditation Now: Inner Peace Through Inner Wisdom."
Walkie-talkies in hand, handlers at the ready, the two-RV, two-camper
caravan will head upstate to North Fork, a town near Yosemite, and
the California Vipassana Center.</TE>
<TE>   Goenka, who remains unruffled even amid a mild media circus,
allowed a reporter to spend an hour aboard the RV as it cruised the
L.A. freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Goenka has hooked up at RV parks, from Charlotte, North
Carolina to Boulder, Colorado. He has spoken at high schools, college
campuses and, on Saturday, at the Wadsworth Theatre in Brentwood. He
has traversed the forests, mountains, deserts and national parks of
this country, driven the 5, the 10 and the 405, on a quintessentially
American road trip--not exactly seeking enlightenment, a la Jack
Kerouac or Ken Kesey, but delivering it.</TE>
<TE>   Regrettably, Goenka missed the Grand Canyon, because he had to fly
back to the United Nations to give a keynote address on May 28 for a
celebration of Vesakha, which marks the birth, enlightenment and the
death of Buddha. He called his talk "Buddha: Super-Scientist of
Peace."</TE>
<TE>   Goenka rides like a business traveler, reading spectacles ready,
crisp New York Times and Wall Street Journal tucked under his arm.
His chauffeurs are his students, volunteers who are honored to drive
the great teacher.</TE>
<TE>   His cook, who has been with him for more than 30 years, travels in
a separate camper full of spices brought from India and procured from
Indian groceries scattered across the nation, on call to cook
curries. All Goenka's support here in the U.S. is unpaid. Everywhere
he goes, his students turn out with food.</TE>
<TE>   From Azusa, the RV zoomed up the onramp and sailed down the
freeway, a bubble of calm and quiet, traveling through the mad urban
jungle that stretched gray and ceaseless to the horizon. Out the
window, the jagged skyline of downtown Los Angeles rose from the
sprawl and the smog. "When I pass through the downtown of a city, I
think, look at the people, they are so miserable," Goenka said.
"Look, they are running, running, running. I passed through that
life. So I know how much tension there is in that life."</TE>
<TE>   Goenka prefers the open country.</TE>
<TE>   As the RV caravan neared a downtown interchange, traffic ground to
a halt. Irritated drivers all around sighed, and screamed into their
cell phones. His wife tapped her watch. The secretary looked
agitated. Walkie-talkies crackled. Goenka remained unperturbed.</TE>
<TE>   "How much tension those people must be feeling," Goenka said,
peering with compassion through the panorama of the front window into
the ribbon of cars, buses and pickups. "They have to be at a certain
place, at a certain time, they hit a red light ... with this
practice, they can remain with a smile."</TE>
<TE>   Goenka was born to ethnic Indian parents in the city of Mandalay
in what used to be Burma and is now Myanmar. He became a successful
businessman, with manufacturing firms. At 31, he took his first
meditation course, and after the military took over the country,
nationalized its industry, he turned to his study of meditation full
time. He became a teacher, and in 1969 went to India to conduct his
first 10-day course.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, various meditation movements have achieved
popularity in America. In the 1950s, authors like Kerouac and poet
Allen Ginsberg popularized Zen meditation. Later, with the rise of
the Beatles, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's transcendental meditation
became something of a fad.</TE>
<TE>   Vipassana, which means "to see things as they really are," is one
of India's ancient meditation techniques. Practitioners are initiated
through a 10-day course, during which they sit for hours-long
stretches in absolute silence, without eye contact, writing, or
communication of any kind except with teachers at the end of each
day.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is freedom--often from the self.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of wandering like a monkey here and there, the monkey
mind gets calm," Goenka said.</TE>
<TE>   Courses, food and spartan accommodations are free (although
donations are encouraged and help support the centers).</TE>
<TE>   Vipassana courses have been taught in schools in India, and
high-security prisons all over the world, including Donaldson Prison,
near Birmingham, Ala. In 1996, the Indian state of Maharashtra began
offering paid leave to officials every three years for a Vipassana
course, to help the stressed bureaucrats mellow out. Today, there are
80 Vipassana meditation centers worldwide, from Mongolia to Serbia,
including four in the United States and three in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Goenka does not like to fly or to spend his time packing,
unpacking, rushing to and waiting in airports. Security concerns
since Sept. 11 have only made air travel more difficult. Why not an
RV, thought Dr. Dhananjay Chavan, an Indian psychiatrist who is
Goenka's secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never been in a motor home before," said Chavan. "We are
not used to this. If we go out and ask for a hookup [in India], they
will say, 'What is this?'"</TE>
<TE>   Here, it seemed perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "You get tired after an hour or so [in India]," Goenka said. "The
roads are so bad. There is dust all around. In this respect, it is
good here. You have good roads. Good cars."</TE>
<TE>   As the L.A. landscape flowed by--palm trees, the Hollywood sign,
smoggy sunshine--Goenka spoke of Buddha.</TE>
<TE>   Gautama Buddha, a prince born in the 6th century BC in what is now
Nepal, abandoned his life of luxury and embraced contemplation and
spiritual growth, promulgating what are called the "four noble
truths": Life is suffering, suffering is caused by desire, there is a
way to stop the suffering, and there is a path that will lead to that
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially in the United States, people have a very wrong
impression about Buddha. They think he is pessimistic, that he is
always talking of misery, misery. There is no optimistic person like
Buddha. He talks of misery, but how to come out of it."</TE>
<TE>   For world leaders, President Bush, harried executives,
stressed-out drivers, actors, writers, directors, producers, he has
one message: "Spare 10 days of your life," Goenka said. "Don't get
afraid with this name of meditation. Actually, it is a way of life.
An art of living. This is a way to get strength. To face the world."</TE>
<TE>   Goenka laughs at the notion that he could be considered a rock
star. "I am a servant of the people," he said. "This is not just for
entertainment. This is for inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett Miller, an Emmy-winning filmmaker from New York who has
"sat" nine times and took three months off from work to film a
documentary portrait of the Indian master, said Goenka is "very
anti-guru. You see people touching his feet all the time. The
impression is that he's not really into it. But he feels it would be
disrespectful to say anything."</TE>
<TE>   The RV pulled to the curb in front of the Museum of Tolerance on
Pico Boulevard, and Goenka climbed out, letting a few waiting Indians
touch his feet. "Be happy," Goenka said. Then he walked inside,
surrounded by fans and handlers, like a true star.</TE>

<LD>Update on Jean, Jake and Zoe</LD>
<LD>   Remember the Los Angeles Zoo's baby chimps Jean, Jake and Zoe? The
last time you read about them on this page, they were still in
diapers and being raised by animal keepers at the zoo's nursery.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few weeks ago, they joined other chimps in the main area of
the "Chimpanzees of Mahale Mountains" exhibit. This was a milestone
for these youngsters because they lived the first year of their lives
with humans. It is always best to have baby animals living with their
own kind, although occasional human help is necessary.</LD>
<TE>   When the keepers first started moving the baby chimps from the
nursery to the chimpanzee exhibit, they started with day trips to
expose them to the sights, smells and sounds of adult chimps. The day
trips soon turned into overnight stays. Then, the babies were
introduced to Toto, 48, and Bonnie, 46. The two older chimps soon
became surrogate grandparents to Jean, Jake and Zoe. They especially
loved Toto because of his tenderness toward younger chimps.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the zoo is halfway toward its goal of having the babies
live with most of the 13 chimpanzees. (About seven of the older
chimpanzees still have to be introduced to the young ones.) It takes
time because animal keepers have to make sure that the older chimps
will accept the youngsters and are willing to teach them chimpanzee
ways.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo's chimp keepers will continue working to get the baby
chimps living with more of the adults. Right now, they are trying to
introduce them to Shaun, who is the father of Jean and Jake. Because
of the introduction, the babies may not be on exhibit. However, you
can always see the other chimps in the main exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about the zoo and its chimpanzees, visit
www.lazoo.org. For general information, call (323) 644-6400.</TE>
<TE>   This information was provided by Judy Shay at the Los Angeles Zoo,
located in Griffith Park at the juncture of the 134 and 5 freeways.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Set among a cluster of bungalow-style cottages transformed into shops
in the South Lake Street neighborhood of Pasadena is a small gallery
dedicated equally to the visual and literary arts.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, creativity and life exude in an atmosphere that is at once
informal and professional. In every room, the walls are adorned with
paintings, prints, textile arts, ceramics, photographs and
sculptures, all framed by built-in bookshelves bursting with
contemporary poetry books.</LD>
<LD>   In a back room off to the right, set apart by glass-paneled doors,
is owner Lisa Krueger's office, also hung with a colorful array of
works. But it's not a typical gallery office; it's a therapy office.
Krueger is a clinical psychologist with a lifelong passion for poetry
and art and a vision for blending her vocation and avocation.</LD>
<TE>   "I had this idea of creating a gallery to honor poetry, art and
literature for a long time," says Krueger, 45, a Pasadena resident
and the mother of two teenage boys and a 9-year-old daughter. "Both
of my parents were avid readers and writers, and my mother was a
docent at LACMA throughout my childhood. She is also an art
consultant, so I grew up going to artists' studios and galleries."</TE>
<TE>   Krueger, who writes poetry and has had a psychology practice since
1991, says she has always incorporated writing and the arts into the
work she does with her clients. "Last summer," she says, "when I
moved my office from a bungalow on Marengo, I decided to try to
create this space. It was the right time in my life for this kind of
adventure."</TE>
<TE>   With a dazzling smile that at once seems to light up and soften
the room, Krueger describes her therapy approach as, in part, "very
interactive and direct." She adds that she believes "writing poetry,
journal writing, making art and talking about art and poetry can help
people in therapy better understand their 'cognitive lives,' which
can have a very positive effect on their general well-being." To this
end, Krueger conducts weekly workshops on journal writing and
creative writing.</TE>
<TE>   Deena Metzger, an L.A.-based poet and author of a well-received
book on writing, supports Krueger's efforts. "Journal writing allows
people to come to know their own story, just as poetry sees through
life's illusions, and when this occurs, healing happens," says
Metzger, who has read from her work in the Krueger Gallery reading
series.</TE>
<TE>   Krueger, who has published two volumes of poetry, keeps up with a
growing body of scholarship that supports the benefits of journal
writing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very research-oriented," she explains, "and what springs to
mind is Dr. James W. Pennebaker's work at the University of Texas a
few years ago on journal writing that is now being replicated in many
places. It shows a strong correlation between journal writing and a
deep decrease in the symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as
in physical ailments such as diabetes and arthritis. This is this
whole new and exciting area in psychology."</TE>
<TE>   Though the American Psychological Assn. takes no official stand on
writing therapy as a healing tool, an article published in this
month's Monitor on Psychology, the group's magazine, discusses the
practice. Merely venting feelings or reliving upsetting events in
writing is not the purpose, several psychologists say. But it can be
useful if patients focus on the meaning they derive from the writing.</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area poet Brenda Hillman, whose recently published
experimental book, "Cascadia," explores the link between the Earth's
geologic processes and the language of the human spirit, believes the
word "redemptive" rather than "healing" better describes art and
poetry's promise and essential quality.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't hesitate to recommend that people read difficult poetry
in times of distress because easy truths don't feed people
ultimately, whereas difficult paradoxes, in which nothing is resolved
but the world is seen for its horror and beauty, can make deep sense
and stave off despair," Hillman said in an e-mail. "We humans don't
really know why art is transformative in this way, just as we don't
understand the nature of suffering itself, but we do recognize that
some help for suffering might come from love and imagination."</TE>
<TE>   The Krueger Gallery offers poetry readings on the first Friday of
the month, where nationally acclaimed poets such as Dana Gioia, Ron
Koertge, Charles Harper Webb and Metzger have appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Along with her assistant, visual artist Karen Kice, Krueger
creates fine letterpress broadsides of poets' works, which can be
purchased at the readings. Broadsides by a range of other poets adorn
the gallery's walls, mixing nicely with other works of art.</TE>
<TE>   There's a poet's corner, with signed books, printed poems and a
few handwritten ones. Krueger also has set aside an area for local
poets and another for, as she says, "all poets who have put together
chapbooks."</TE>
<TE>   "Karen and I have been making these little fiber art gift bags,"
Krueger says, "and when people buy jewelry, scarves or ceramics, I'm
putting a printed poem in each bag so they walk out with a poem."</TE>
<TE>   The poetry series at the Krueger Gallery, at 826 E. California
Blvd., Pasadena, continues with Carol Muske-Dukes and Chris Abani
reading Friday, Eloise Klein Healy on July 5, and an open reading on
Aug. 2.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the dust jacket of Earl Emerson's new thriller, "Vertical Burn"
(Ballantine, $24.95, 340 pages), Sue Grafton is quoted as saying it
is "the most exciting book I've read in years." Though cover blurbs
are generally to be approached with some skepticism, this one you can
take to the bank.</LD>
<LD>   Barely has this compelling story begun when Seattle firefighter
John Finney and his partner find themselves trapped in a warehouse
blaze. Emerson, a seasoned lieutenant in that city's real fire
department as well as an award-winning novelist, describes his hero's
predicament in such chilling, utterly convincing detail that readers
may wind up struggling to breathe along with Finney as he tries to
break free from the smoke and flames. As is the case with the best
suspense fiction, the fireman escapes only to find himself in hotter
water.</LD>
<LD>   Though no charges are made against him, he's being blamed
unofficially by his superiors and his fellow firefighters for
panicking and causing his partner's death. Like many another unjustly
accused protagonist, he begins to sift through the ashes of the
fatality. Each sooty clue brings him one step closer to The Big
Answer, but it also places him in greater jeopardy. That's part of
the proven thriller formula too.</LD>
<TE>   What gives "Burn" a special glow are Emerson's flair for
storytelling (proved time and again in a pair of successful series
featuring private detective Thomas Black and fireman-sheriff Mac
Fontana) and his real-life experience under fire. Not only has he
come up with several ingeniously incendiary setbacks for Finney,
including an airtight frame for murder and arson, he also forces the
self-styled sleuth to gather his information by stepping into a
series of roaring fires so stunningly depicted that you can feel the
heat and smell the acrid smoke.</TE>
<TE>   The author saves the best for last, with the bruised and beaten
but unbowed Finney racing through a high-rise inferno, struggling to
evacuate trapped innocents while being stalked by a cadre of
arsonist-killers. Exciting barely covers it.</TE>
<TE>   Ex-Con Heroine Is</TE>
<TE>   Drawn Into More Trouble</TE>
<TE>   Five books ago, Barbara Seranella introduced Miranda "Munch" (for
Munchkin) Mancini, a unique series protagonist--a former prostitute
and addict (booze and heroin), fresh from prison. Since then, Munch
has struggled to put her life in order. With each novel, set in the
early to mid-1980s, she's moved closer to that goal, maintaining
sobriety, establishing herself as an expert car mechanic and the
owner-operator of a limousine for hire and experiencing the joys of
single motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Her main roadblocks have been companions from the past, mainly
bad, who've drawn her into situations that have tested her
cleverness, physical endurance and resolve to stay straight. One of
her closest pals, a hard-boiled, wig-addicted ex-con named Ellen
Summers, popped up in "Unwanted Company" (2000) to complicate a caper
involving a rogue CIA agent and a series of murders. In the new "No
Man Standing" (Scribner, $24, 304 pages), Ellen returns, released
from prison to a world made even more hostile than usual by an
assortment of uglies willing to torture and destroy for the fortune
she hid before her last arrest.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't hesitate to draw Munch and her daughter into her
dangerous circle. Munch needs no more badness; she's already being
stalked by the semi-psychotic mother of one of her daughter's
friends. But that problem soon pales besides finger-breaking thugs,
suspicious cops and double-dealing feds.</TE>
<TE>   Seranella's strong suit is her ability to view life in an
unconventional, believably streetwise manner. A bristling attitude of
unrelenting suspicion permeates the novels. Munch doesn't just meet
people, she sizes them up. She senses as well as sees, not that what
she senses always helps her. She's aware of what a self-serving,
self-deceiving twit Ellen is, but she still likes her. And because of
the author's ability to create raffish characters in full without
feeling the need to excuse their bad behavior, against our better
nature, we tend to like her too.</TE>
<TE>   New Commander on Spot</TE>
<TE>   as Scams Lead to Murder</TE>
<TE>   Anyone in the mood for a fresh and slightly offbeat police
procedural should immediately investigate Elizabeth Gunn's
"Seventh-Inning Stretch" (Walker, $23.95, 219 pages). The setting is
the normally peaceful town of Rutherford, Minn. The hero is a
no-nonsense lawman named Jake Hines who, after four previous outings,
has been promoted to chief of detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Here, he's trying to adjust to the administrative side of
crime-busting--justifying his staff selections to his superior,
closing out cold cases and establishing working procedures--when a
group of con artists hits town. The scams eventually lead to grim
murder, putting the pressure on Hines and his crew.</TE>
<TE>   First-person narration is unusual in police tales, especially when
the story involves ensemble activity. But Gunn's decision to let us
see his crew through Jake's eyes is a sound one. The crime story is
tricky, involving a member of Jake's team. And the subplot, in which
Hines and his significant other, a crime lab technician named Trudy
Hanson, struggle to make their new fixer-upper farmhouse livable adds
a nice personal balance to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Lochte, author of the prize-winning novel "Sleeping Dog," and
its sequel, "Laughing Dog" (Poisoned Pen Press), reviews mysteries
every other Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>Do you think it's pleasant sitting on the dining table with that dog
staring at me? It is not! His eyes never blink. They're like
searchlights glaring at me. I can't even lick myself clean from that
dog's breath. I tried to ignore him. I even tried to fake a nap,
hoping he would get bored and let me alone. But not that dog. He
won't give up, and where are the Rogerses? Why don't they come home?</LD>
<LD>   I waited and waited, until I got so tired of waiting I decided to
take my chances at sneaking away. I crept slowly off the back of the
table with that dog staring at me, but he didn't move. I slowly let
myself down onto a chair and then--whoosh! Out the dining room and
into the living room I ran. Eowwww! He was after me!</LD>
<LD>   I raced under the piano. Too late! He was on my tail. I zoomed
down the hall, into the bedroom, and slipped under the quilt. Pow! He
jumped on the bed and pounced on me.</LD>
<TE>   Meowwww!!! I jumped off the bed, back down the hall, into the
closet, and climbed onto the top shelf.</TE>
<TE>   There he was, looking up at me with those eyes, but he couldn't
reach me.</TE>
<TE>   Na-na-na-na-NA-na!</TE>
<TE>   I sat and waited, and so did he. It seemed like forever, and then
I heard the front door open. It was the Rogerses, finally, and that
dog went to greet them.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, Billy," Johnny said. "Have you been lonesome waiting for us?
Want to go for a walk?"</TE>
<TE>   And then Mrs. Rogers came into the hall and passed the closet
where I was sitting on the top shelf. "Who left the door to the linen
closet open?" she asked, and she slammed it shut with me inside.
Oh-oh!</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: HEELLLP!!!</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Gould likes to write about her pets. Her book, "Golden
Daffodils," has a cat named Pickles that is a lot like Fluffy. This
story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

of Honor more frequently than any other ethnic group. According to
the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, there have been 87 African
American and 40 Latino recipients. The story should have said that
Mexican Americans have the most recipients within the larger Latino
community. Additionally, some others that could be defined as ethnic
groups, such as Irish Americans, also have more Medal of Honor awards
than Latinos.</LD>

<HD>Andersen Testimony Ends</HD>
<DH>Courts: With the case's basic facts not in dispute, the
verdict could hinge on closing arguments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for accounting firm Arthur Andersen rested their case
Tuesday, setting the stage for crucial closing arguments today that
trial observers believe could tip the balance in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides in the Andersen trial have essentially battled to a
draw, making the summation a potential turning point, said veteran
Houston litigator David Berg. With the basic facts not in dispute,
Berg said closing arguments will be a last chance for the attorneys
to give jurors the arguments they need to persuade others on the
panel to their way of thinking.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to arm your friends and disarm your enemies on that
jury," Berg said.</LD>
<TE>   Each side is expected to take up to four hours to present their
summation. Prosecutors plan to argue that Andersen, already on
probation for previous audit failures, feared additional sanctions
arising from Enron Corp.'s collapse and orchestrated a campaign to
destroy potentially incriminating documents to impede a Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation.</TE>
<TE>   One of the government's primary objectives, analysts say, should
be to undermine Andersen's contention that the document shredding
that took place in October was an exercise in routine housekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   For the defense, led by veteran Texas lawyer Rusty Hardin, the
closing will be a final chance to argue that Andersen lacked the
criminal intent required for a conviction, and that the Justice
Department, by indicting the firm, unfairly tainted a company of more
than 25,000 people--most of whom didn't work on auditing Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, if I were Rusty Hardin, I'd want to get very, very
over the top," Berg said. "I'd put the government on trial, say that
what they've done is unconscionable."</TE>
<TE>   Several wild cards remain. One is the extent to which jurors may
lean toward punishing Andersen for obstruction of justice because of
its connection to Enron, whose collapse cost thousands of local jobs
and billions of dollars in investment and retirement losses.</TE>
<TE>   Another is how the panel will feel about Hardin, who has openly
quarreled with what he considered pro-prosecution rulings by U.S.
District Judge Melinda Harmon. Almost every major evidentiary ruling
in the case has gone the government's way.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon also will instruct the panel on the law governing the case
today. The statute under which Andersen is charged says it is a crime
to "corruptly persuade" another person to destroy materials with the
intent to "impair the object's integrity or availability for use in
an official proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   Under the prosecution theory, when Andersen in-house attorney
Nancy Temple sent an e-mail Oct.12 referencing the firm's document
retention policy to a Houston partner, she intended it as a coded
signal to begin shredding Enron-related documents. The policy calls
for the retention of papers needed to back up an auditor's
conclusions and the disposal of drafts and other files deemed
unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's lead Enron auditor, David Duncan, testified that the
e-mail was part of what motivated him Oct. 23 to direct his team to
comply with the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who has pleaded guilty to obstruction, said he knew his
order would result in the destruction of documents and make them
unavailable to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Duncan's plea is all the government needs to prove
that Andersen is guilty. The instructions said Duncan's plea alone is
not evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also had made an unusual request to Harmon to let the
jury consider three Andersen employees' refusal to testify as
evidence against the firm. But the judge rejected the request, with
the two sides agreeing that she should instruct jurors that for
reasons "with which you need not concern yourself," the employees
"were unavailable to testify" and that no conclusion should be drawn
for or against either Andersen or the government.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, prosecutors finished cross-examining Andersen's
last witness, senior partner John Riley, a former SEC official who
testified Monday that he didn't expect regulators to investigate
Andersen until after the firm concluded Nov. 5 that Enron would have
to restate its earnings from earlier fiscal quarters.</TE>
<TE>   But in questioning Riley, Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Weissmann
suggested that Riley, who worked at the SEC for 11 years, should have
known--based on his personal experience with Andersen's botched
audits of Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp.--that the agency
would be asking for Andersen files.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon, wrapping up the proceedings for the day, told jurors to
"bring your pajamas" because she plans to sequester the panel during
deliberations.</TE>

<HD>Housing Market Boosted Economy</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The robust industry was a key reason the
Southland experienced a mild recession, report shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The housing industry accounted for a larger share of the economy in
Southern California over the last six years than in any other region
in the U.S., according to a report that will be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The findings, which will be announced in Washington by a
consortium of industry groups, confirm the role housing played in
buffering the region and the nation against recession. The robust
housing market was a key reason that Southern California experienced
only a mild slowing in economic growth, the report showed, while the
Bay Area and other parts of the country recorded a sharper decline.</LD>
<LD>   More than half of the growth in the region's gross domestic
product since the mid-1990s has been due to boom-like activity in
housing and rising home prices, according to Economy.com, a data
tracking firm in West Chester, Pa., that compiled the report.</LD>
<TE>   Higher prices "lifted equity significantly and increased the
willingness of consumers to spend on everything else," said Mark
Zandi, the firm's economist. Home buying and home building, along
with brisk consumer spending, were the main reasons the recession was
one of the mildest in history.</TE>
<TE>   American homeowners received about $90 billion in cash-out
mortgages that were refinanced last year, according to Freddie Mac, a
major secondary lender.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for new housing eventually will diminish as more consumers
find homes and the costs of borrowing increases. But the drop-off in
Southern California will be milder than elsewhere because of an
inadequate amount of planned construction to handle growth.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other markets that got a big economic boost from housing
were in Orlando, Fla., Miami and Tampa, Fla. Those that received the
least benefit included Detroit, Memphis, Tenn., Salt Lake City and
Austin, Texas.</TE>

<HD>Bristol-Myers Sued Over Taxol Generic</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: States accuse firm of illegally blocking
cheaper rivals to its breast cancer drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adding to a growing legal assault on drug industry marketing
practices, California and 28 other states Tuesday charged
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. with illegal efforts to block cheaper
generic rivals to its top-selling breast cancer drug Taxol.</LD>
<LD>   The states accuse the company, in part, of manipulating the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office process with fraudulent patents, a tactic
designed to prevent competitors from entering the market until 2000.
The drug industry giant had fought competitors for years to preserve
its exclusive right to manufacture and sell Taxol, which had brought
in $1.6 billion in annual sales until a generic version slashed that
figure by 45% in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit seeks unspecified civil penalties and a court order
that would prohibit Bristol-Myers Squibb from engaging in such
tactics in the future. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer added that
the states are seeking the return of $200 million to $250 million in
estimated overcharges on Taxol.</LD>
<TE>   "This particular action is in response to one of the more
egregious cases of antitrust violations. We strongly believe that BMS
violated these laws," Lockyer said, adding that settlement
negotiations were not successful.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief statement, Bristol-Myers Squibb essentially accused the
states of piggybacking on an old case. "The only news in this lawsuit
is that the states have chosen to enter late in the litigation. The
actual events at issue are several years old and have been the
subject of litigation for some time," said the company statement. "We
will continue to deal with the issues raised by this new suit as we
have been doing with other litigation related to these matters."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Steven Gerber, with CIBC World Markets, said, "This is
going to be a difficult case for the states to fight because existing
law has allowed the pharmaceutical companies to engage in such
practices, and the law needs to be changed." He added that pending
legislation in the Senate, sponsored by John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), would tighten loopholes and "make it
more difficult for companies to engage in delay tactics that
ultimately hurt consumers."</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the states, as well as consumer groups and
health plans, have filed lawsuits against large and small
pharmaceutical companies in the last year, claiming antitrust
violations and illegal manipulations of prescription drug prices.
Some generic drug manufacturers have even been named in some of the
lawsuits for allegedly colluding with brand name companies to stall
the manufacture of a cheaper drug.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer and Jeff Boyd, the Texas deputy attorney general for
litigation, added that other shoes would drop in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Texas has already charged three drug makers--Dey Inc., Roxane
Laboratories Inc., a unit of Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim  , and
Warrick Pharmaceutical Corp., a unit of Schering-Plough Corp.--with
inflating their average wholesale prices, which states use to
determine what they will have to pay for medications.</TE>
<TE>   Through that inflation, Boyd said, doctors received higher
payments than warranted for the drugs, leading them to prescribe more
of those drugs, helping the companies gain market share.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd said that Texas Atty. Gen. John Cornyn is pursuing 17 similar
cases against other drug companies. In California, Lockyer said that
the state has issued administrative subpoenas and is investigating
"dozens" of drug manufacturers for price manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Several other multi-state lawsuits were filed in 2001 and this
year, including one in January by Nevada against 12 major drug
companies for "employing a pricing scheme which we think robs states
and consumers of a great deal of money," said Nevada Atty. Gen.
Frankie Sue Del Papa, adding that the state spent $60 million on
prescription drugs in 2001, up from $40 million in 1999. "We are
trying to protect the taxpayers' health and their pocketbooks."</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Trade Commission also has entered the fray, with
Commissioner Timothy Muris telling Congress that his agency can crack
down on drug patent disputes that delay generic competition. Muris
cited Biovail Corp., which agreed to settle FTC claims this year that
it improperly listed a patent with the Food and Drug Administration
to prevent generic competition.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers Squibb also is the subject of a lawsuit filed in
December by 29 states and Puerto Rico that alleges the company
conspired to keep generic versions of its Bu- Spar anti-anxiety drug
off the market.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb closed at $28.65,
down $1.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Improper Power Data Sale Alleged</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Bidding system 'holes' reportedly were
revealed to energy companies by computer firm Perot Systems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perot Systems Corp., a Texas company that set up the computer systems
behind California's electricity markets, peddled a detailed blueprint
of how to exploit market loopholes to raise power prices--a clear
conflict of interest, a state senator said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana), who chairs a committee
investigating price manipulation in California's energy markets,
released a document by Plano-based Perot Systems that discusses
"holes" in the bidding systems of the California Power Exchange and
the California Independent System Operator, the two markets set up in
1998 to trade power under California's newly deregulated electricity
business.</LD>
<LD>   The document consists of 43 graphics from a computerized
presentation made to Reliant Energy and other sellers in California's
electricity market.</LD>
<TE>   A Perot Systems spokesman said: "While we have not had the
opportunity to review these documents, we are proud of the work we
did for California consumers."</TE>
<TE>   The firm, which designs and maintains computer systems, was
founded in 1988 by H. Ross Perot, the former presidential candidate.
He remains chairman of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems did not create the rules governing California's
electricity markets but did design the computer systems for the PX
and Cal-ISO and continued to offer technology services for a time.</TE>
<TE>   The Perot Systems presentation appears to be a primer on
California's markets for electricity that seeks to answer the
question: "What strategies will help you prosper in the California
market structure?" It notes that "strategies can affect prices" and
"a small participant could control prices in CA and destabilize the
PX market."</TE>
<TE>   The final pages of the document map out a "game" to create
congestion on the electricity grid that could significantly increase
the price that the seller would receive for electricity--a strategy
similar to one Enron Corp. used in California, as detailed in
recently disclosed memos.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the ultimate of conflicts of interest. It could open them
up to civil and criminal liability issues," Dunn said, adding that
Perot Systems had the duty to alert the PX and Cal-ISO to loopholes,
not sell the information to market participants. The undated
presentation appears to have been created early in the markets' life,
Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant included the Perot presentation in documents it sent to
Dunn's committee and to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
which also is investigating manipulation of Western energy markets.
Dunn released the document after Reliant waived confidentiality,
noting that the presentation had been made to other California market
participants.</TE>

<HD>FERC Threatens to Punish 4 Firms</HD>
<DH>Energy: Regulators say they could revoke trading rights of
the companies over lack of data on dealings in California's market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators investigating abuses in California's energy
markets accused four companies Tuesday of withholding information and
threatened to revoke their trading rights.</LD>
<LD>   The aggressive move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
was intended to jolt the companies into cooperating, an agency
official said.</LD>
<LD>   "What the commission wants is answers to its questions," said the
official, who asked not to be identified.</LD>
<TE>   FERC last month demanded that about 150 energy-trading firms
declare under oath whether they engaged in any of several
manipulative trading strategies described in internal Enron Corp.
memoranda, which involved taking advantage of market rules to boost
profit.</TE>
<TE>   The four companies named Tuesday, Avista Corp., El Paso Electric
Co., Portland General Electric Co. and Williams Energy Marketing &amp;
Trading, were trading partners with Enron during the 2000-2001 period
that FERC is investigating. (El Paso Electric is not affiliated with
larger El Paso Corp. of Houston. Portland General is a utility in
Oregon and is a subsidiary of Houston-based Enron.)</TE>
<TE>   "Certain public utilities ... are not fully cooperating with the
investigation, thus hindering the commission's ability to determine
whether the Western markets have been manipulated," FERC said. . It
also warned, "Additional orders of this nature may be forthcoming."</TE>
<TE>   The four companies said they are cooperating with FERC's
investigation and will attempt to provide more information.</TE>
<TE>   FERC ordered the companies to show within 10 days why their
ability to charge market prices should not be revoked.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, utility rates have been set by regulators on the
basis of what it costs a firm to produce power, plus an allowance for
profit. With the coming of deregulation in several states, FERC has
granted about 1,200 companies the right to set their own
"market-based" rates for wholesale electricity.</TE>
<TE>   But that privilege is contingent on good behavior and maintaining
"just and reasonable" rates. Loss of market-based pricing would
hobble the companies' ability to compete.</TE>
<TE>   FERC found various problems with responses from the four firms.</TE>
<TE>   Portland General admitted taking part in 17 "ricochet" trades
during a two-month period in 2000. Ricochet was the name Enron
traders gave to transactions that involved shipping power out of
California and then selling it back into the state's energy market at
higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   However, FERC said recorded trading floor conversations point to a
wider role of Portland General from April to June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area was the destination for most of the power
from the 17 transactions that was sold out of state and then imported
with a markup, FERC said.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC order does not say whether the power went to the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power or another municipal utility in
the Los Angeles area, such as Glendale Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   DWP has denied sharing profit with Enron and insists it only sold
the company access to its transmission wires.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Water and Power is investigating whether its traders
knowingly participated in Enron's market manipulation. Glendale had a
profit-sharing agreement with Enron from June 1999 to June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Avista denied it had taken part in ricochet trades. However, FERC
said transcripts of routinely recorded conversations among traders
that were provided by Portland General reveal that "Avista personnel
were indeed actively involved in such transactions."</TE>
<TE>   FERC said El Paso responded that it had no knowledge of any of the
abusive trades described in the Enron memos. But regulators deemed
that answer "simply not credible" in view of the fact that the
utility had "extensive joint dealings" with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said in its filing that it could not tell whether its
traders had engaged in the ricochet strategy, but FERC deemed that
answer "an unacceptable failure to cooperate."</TE>
<TE>   Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams said it will tell FERC it did not buy
power in California for sale outside the state at higher prices.</TE>

<HD>Fed Chairman Says Prospects Looking Brighter</HD>
<DH>Economy: Greenspan cautions central bankers not to let down
their guard against inflation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that America's
economic prospects were looking brighter, but cautioned that economic
growth in the coming months will slow from the January-March pace.</LD>
<LD>   "I suspect the American economy is in an upswing--it's not going
to be a dramatic upswing ... but events look increasingly positive,"
Greenspan said during a panel discussion with other central bankers.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. economy, which suffered its first recession in a decade
last year, rebounded at an annual rate of 5.6% in this year's first
quarter. But Greenspan, agreeing with the consensus of private
forecasters, said that going forward, "We will not grow at the pace
of the first quarter."</LD>
<TE>   Many private forecasters say the economy will turn in growth rates
of 3% to 4% for the rest of the year. U.S. unemployment, currently at
an eight-year high of 6%, is expected to peak around 6.5% later this
summer before starting to decline.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank, after pushing interest rates to a 40-year low of
1.75% last year to fight the recession and the shocks from the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, has left rates unchanged this year.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe the Fed will remain on the sidelines until
at least their August meeting, waiting for signs that the jobless
rate has begun to fall.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank has room to maneuver, because inflation outside
of energy prices has remained moderate. Greenspan said businesses had
very little power to raise prices because of the lingering effects
from last year's recession. But he cautioned that it would be a
mistake for central bankers to let down their guard against the
threat of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said last year's recession could be the shallowest of
the last 50 years. The rebound this year would be "pedestrian"
because the economy did not have to make up much lost ground.</TE>
<TE>   He said the U.S. economy was able to bounce back so quickly from
the recession and the terrorist attacks because of a "dramatic
increase" in the use of information technology by companies, which
allowed them to quickly adjust to changing circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said a big swing in inventory investment by businesses
was stimulating production dramatically, although he said there was a
question over whether final demand will hold up. His comments came at
the International Monetary Conference, an annual meeting between top
officials of the world's largest banks and central bankers.</TE>

<HD>HP Trims Annual Revenue Estimates</HD>
<DH>Technology: The firm expects greater savings from Compaq
merger and says 10,000 jobs may be cut by Nov. 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. executives Tuesday trimmed sales estimates for
the next year and a half in their first gathering for financial
analysts since HP acquired Compaq Computer Corp. after a hotly
contested shareholder vote.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Financial Officer Robert Wayman guided analyst expectations
for the second half of this year to $35 billion to $36billion--the
same as a year before and down from just more than $37billion.</LD>
<LD>   "We thought we might see a muted recovery in '02. I don't think
we'll see that," Chief Executive Carly Fiorina told the all-day
gathering in Boston.</LD>
<TE>   For the next fiscal year, HP now expects sales to increase by 7%
to 9%, to as much as $86 billion, instead of 8% to 10%, Wayman said.
The company didn't give earnings projections.</TE>
<TE>   But the executives said savings from the Compaq purchase should be
better than they had predicted because of additional contract
renegotiations, real estate consolidation and other factors. Although
HP had forecast savings of as much as $2.5 billion a year, it said
Tuesday that it should carve away $3billion in costs in fiscal 2004.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares rose 12 cents to $18.97 on the New York Stock Exchange,
up nearly 9% since the merger's completion a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina also gave more detail on the timing of job reductions,
predicting that 10,000 jobs will be eliminated by Nov. 1, when the
fiscal year ends. An additional 5,000 positions will be dropped in
fiscal 2003, one year ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The executives said corporate information technology spending is
still retrenching, and that businesses are more concerned about
integrating the products they have than in buying new gear.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Compaq deal claimed that Fiorina had been
underestimating the amount of revenue that will be lost when
overlapping product lines are eliminated. But Fiorina said she was
sticking by her earlier estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "We remain comfortable with the revenue loss due to the merger we
laid out," Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the merger, HP had an incentive to give optimistic
forecasts in order to win over shareholders. Now that the merger is
over, Fiorina acknowledged she will probably give low targets in
hopes of impressing Wall Street when they are exceeded.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is not the time to set that bar too high," she said. "Now is
the time to set the bar that we can meet or beat."</TE>
<TE>   Marty Shagrin, an analyst at Victory Capital, which owns about 6
million HP shares, said HP's outlook was positive, since the
company's restructuring proved a source of strength.</TE>
<TE>   "In the face of a very difficult environment, it is nice to have
[an investment] thesis built on not having the economy get better,"
he said. "The next year is going to be driven by their ability to
take costs from the business, and they seem to have a handle on
that."</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros. analyst Dan Niles said HP's assessment of still-slow
tech spending cast a shadow on the industry. "For many, it is going
to be a disappointment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he added that HP was dealing with it well. "They are executing
better than they expected and we expected," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Niles said he expected Wall Street to lower its earnings estimates
for the company based on the new HP revenue guidance. Currently,
analysts expect the company to post earnings of 88 cents a share for
fiscal 2002 and $1.29 for fiscal 2003.</TE>

<HD>Panel Subpoenas Ex-ImClone Chief</HD>
<DH>Biotech: CEO is called to testify at House hearing on
whether investors were misled about drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A congressional committee Tuesday subpoenaed former ImClone Systems
Inc. Chief Executive Samuel Waksal to appear at a hearing next week
on whether the drug maker misled investors about its colon cancer
drug Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   Waksal met with investigators for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee last month for four hours but answered "only a few of the
many questions raised," said committee spokesman Ken Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Waksal, who resigned as chief executive in May, refused to meet
again with investigators on the advice of his attorney, Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   Neither Waksal nor his attorney, Lewis Liman, could be reached.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing, set for next Thursday, is expected to cover a number
of issues surrounding ImClone's handling of Erbitux, a highly touted
cancer treatment that failed a critical regulatory milestone in
December. Hype about the drug drove ImClone's shares as high as $70
in the weeks before the Food and Drug Administration rejected the
company's application. ImClone's shares closed at $8.95 on Tuesday,
up 15 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the actions of ImClone itself, the committee, chaired by
Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), will investigate whether the FDA's
secret drug review process creates an environment in which
"pre-market promotion and stock manipulation can occur," Johnson
said.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone told investors about the December rejection letter but did
not share many details. The serious nature of the problems facing
Erbitux emerged when an industry newsletter published a leaked copy
of the FDA letter. The newsletter revealed that the FDA considered
the data from Erbitux clinical trials so flawed that the agency could
not tell whether the drug worked.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan Waksal, ImClone chief executive and Samuel's brother, is
expected to testify at the hearing. Representatives from the FDA and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. also are expected to appear. Bristol paid
$2billion last fall to acquire a stake in ImClone and marketing
rights to Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based ImClone released a statement saying it would
continue to "work closely with and cooperate fully" with the
committee. The company also is the subject of an inquiry by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.</TE>

<HD>Water-Damage Payments in State Have Doubled Since '97,
Survey Says</HD>
<DH>Insurance: More firms seek to raise premiums and to be
exempt from covering mold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Insurance payments to homeowners for water damage have doubled in
California since 1997, according to an industry survey that's sure to
intensify the debate over rising premiums and insurers' increasing
reluctance to pay claims related to mold.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, to be released today by the Insurance Information
Network of California, showed 24% of property insurance claims filed
by the state's homeowners in 1997 involved water damage, the category
that includes mold claims. By last year, the figure had climbed to
32%.</LD>
<LD>   The amount insurers paid in water claims to homeowners rose even
more sharply, from $206.1million, or 20% of all property insurance
payments, in 1997, to $430.5 million, 31% of such payments, in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The survey included insurers representing 63% of the state
homeowners' market, but no commercial lines, and the figures aren't
inflation-adjusted. Nonetheless, the industry says it's enough data
to explain why insurers are seeking to raise homeowners' premiums and
to be exempt from covering mold claims, or--in the case of State Farm
Insurance Cos.--to stop writing new homeowner policies in California
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "There are concerns that we're heading for a crisis," said
Insurance Information Network spokeswoman Candysse Miller. "Think
back a few years to the period after the Northridge earthquake, when
any homeowner insurance was nearly unavailable."</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Insurance last month granted Allstate
Corp., California's third-largest insurer, an 18.5% increase in
premiums for home insurance policies, the latest in a series of
approved rate increases.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm's California home insurance subsidiary, the state's
largest home insurer, recently won two hikes totaling 14%, and
Farmers Insurance Group and the Automobile Club of Southern
California have rate-increase requests pending.</TE>
<TE>   With insurance claims rising nationwide after a relatively quiet
period during much of the 1990s, the industry also has been seeking
to limit its coverage of events including terrorism, dog bites and
mold-related health claims.</TE>
<TE>   As of May 1, the state Insurance Department had received 287
filings from insurers seeking to exclude or limit water-damage
claims--mostly for commercial lines, but also on homeowners and even
auto policies.</TE>
<TE>   During recent hearings, though, some state legislators questioned
whether the industry had proved the mold risks were extreme enough to
warrant the exclusions. According to the Department of Insurance, the
companies were only willing to reduce premiums by 1% to 3% after
excluding mold claims.</TE>
<TE>   "The average person would conclude this just doesn't smell right,"
said state Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento). "It's the equivalent of
saying, 'If there's a fire, we won't cover smoke damage.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz has sponsored legislation requiring insurers to cover mold
claims that result from a "covered peril" such as a burst water pipe.
The bill, which also would require more disclosures about policy
exclusions, passed the Senate last month and will be taken up by an
Assembly insurance committee.</TE>
<TE>   The issue snowballed nationally after claims for mold-abatement
work and mold-related health claims mushroomed in Texas, which
requires insurers to provide mold-related coverage. Farmers Insurance
Group is appealing a $32-million judgment last year for its handling
of one such claim. As lawmakers across the country consider
legislation such as that sponsored by Ortiz, the industry is arguing
that new laws should be delayed until more studies are completed of
the health hazards presented by mold.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no scientific consensus on what the mold problem is or
how to deal with it. If insurers pay for mold remediation, they have
no certainty that what is being done is effective or even necessary,"
Eric Goldberg, assistant general counsel for the American Insurance
Assn., told a New York state Senate health committee last month.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said water damage--and consequent mold claims--can be
significantly reduced by better maintenance, quick repairs and
ensuring bathrooms and laundries are well-ventilated. She said the
industry will undertake a major campaign to educate policyholders.</TE>

<HD>Knight Trading's Shares Sink on SEC, NASD Probe</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Firm is accused of placing its orders for
stocks before orders placed by clients during tech boom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest trader of Nasdaq stocks is the latest firm to trigger
mistrust on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Knight Trading Group Inc. acknowledged Tuesday that a former
employee has accused it of improper trading practices during the
1990s tech boom, prompting investigations by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. The
company denies any wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   "The allegations are completely unfounded. The very private
arbitration case was made public by an unhappy ex-employee. We are
comfortable that we have not done anything wrong.... We will be
totally vindicated," Chief Executive Thomas M. Joyce said.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC declined to comment, and the NASD couldn't be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's stock took a beating Tuesday. The shares fell $1.28, or
22%, to $4.64 in Nasdaq trading after falling as low as $3.75 early
in the day.</TE>
<TE>   The probe is a result of a sealed arbitration complaint filed late
last year by Robert Stellato, the former head of Knight Trading's
institutional trading desk, Joyce said.</TE>
<TE>   Jersey City, N.J.-based Knight Trading, the biggest trader of
stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, is accused of placing its
own orders for stocks before orders placed by clients. The
practice--known as front-running--would have allowed Knight Trading
to profit from the increase in stock price caused by its client's
subsequent order.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint by Stellato, as reported in the Wall
Street Journal, Stellato was warned of missteps at the firm soon
after joining Knight in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint: "These warnings prompted Stellato to
interview the rest of the institutional sales traders, who each told
him that [company executives] were, at the least, front-running
customer orders."</TE>
<TE>   In January, Knight was fined more than $1.5 million for a series
of violations, the largest penalty imposed by the NASD for the
violations involved. The fine coincided with the departure of Kenneth
Pasternak, who helped found Knight in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Knight reported a loss for the first quarter as revenue slid to
$133.5 million, down 74% from the same quarter two years earlier at
the height of the bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday marked the second day of bad news for Knight. On Monday,
the firm said a software glitch caused its computers to dump more
that 1 million shares of its own stock--causing the price to plummet
by 50% in pre-market trading. The Nasdaq market later canceled the
trades at Knight's request, and the stock ended the day down only 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Knight carried out an average of 480,000 stock trades a day in the
first quarter, down 31% from 700,000 two years earlier. Joyce said
that the latest two days of turmoil have not reduced trading volumes
noticeably.</TE>

<TE>   The Nasdaq composite gained 15.56 points, or 1%, to 1,578.12.</TE>
<TE>   Key indexes had tumbled Monday, depressed in part by new
allegations of scandal in the executive suites of major companies.
The Dow slumped 215 points. Nasdaq slid 53 points.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, some investors took advantage of recent declines to
snap up bargains. But losers still outnumbered winners by 8 to 7 on
the New York Stock Exchange and by 19 to 16 on Nasdaq in active
trading.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow's close was its lowest since Feb. 7.</TE>
<TE>   News of possible trading abuses at leading Nasdaq dealer Knight
Trading Group undercut investor confidence. The revelations came a
day after the chief executive of conglomerate Tyco International quit
amid allegations he did not pay state taxes on art purchases. Tyco
CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski was formally charged Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a perfect storm in stocks," said Philip Ruffat, senior
vice president at Mizuho Securities USA. "You have fraud and deceit
in accounting, and you have high [stock] valuations."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts noted that the continuing threat of a nuclear conflict
between India and Pakistan also is weighing on sentiment. That same
concern is helping gold: Near-term gold futures in New York rose
$1.10 to $327.80 an ounce, highest since October 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The latest comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan sent stocks lower in late trading after he qualified a
statement that an upswing in inventory investment by businesses was
stimulating production. Greenspan said inventory rebuilding was "a
one-shot affair ... and the question is: 'Will final demand hold up
continued growth?'"</TE>
<TE>   In foreign trading, European markets were sharply lower on the
heels of Monday's U.S. stock decline. The German market plunged 2.6%,
the French market lost 3.8% and the Swiss market slid 2.1%.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the dollar recovered a bit after its steep
recent losses against the euro and the yen.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Tech shares getting a lift included Cisco Systems, up 75 cents
to $16.08; IBM, up $1.20 to $79.31; and Intel, up 88 cents to $27.50.</TE>
<TE>   But contract manufacturer Flextronics International skidded $2.43,
or almost 20%, to $9.89. The company warned it would miss Wall Street
earnings and revenue estimates this quarter because of
still-depressed technology spending.</TE>
<TE>   * In the telecom sector, Qwest Communications fell 2 cents to
$5.08 after eliminating its quarterly cash dividend to save money.
Also, Nortel Networks sank 28 cents to $1.80 after the company said
it plans to raise $800 million by issuing new shares.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline shares continued to slide on worries about industry
losses. Continental fell $1.54 to $19.51 and Northwest dropped 75
cents to $15.18.</TE>
<TE>   * In the drug sector, Novartis lost 62 cents to $41.83, Lilly fell
$1.89 to $62.06 and Pharmacia gave up $1.11 to $40.40.</TE>
<TE>   * AOL Time Warner dropped 89 cents, or 5%, to $17.20 after Lehman
Bros. analyst Holly Becker cut her sales and earnings outlook for the
company in 2002, saying the online advertising slump may last longer
than anticipated. She now forecasts cash flow of $9.6 billion, down
from $9.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of Plumtree Software, which makes Internet infrastructure

<HD>N.Y. Arrests Have Ties to Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Courts: Charges against alleged members and associates of
the Gambino family include attempted extortion of a film figure,
reportedly Steven Seagal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH and PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The former producing partner of actor Steven Seagal was arrested
Tuesday and accused of taking part in a plot by the Gambino crime
family to extort money from a Hollywood film figure, later identified
as the action star.</LD>
<LD>   The charges against Julius "Jules" R. Nasso came in a sweeping
indictment whose broader purpose is to crush organized crime's hold
on local waterfronts, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Named along with Nasso in Tuesday's 68-count federal indictment
charging racketeering, fraud and extortion was the crime family's
acting boss Peter Gotti, the brother of imprisoned "Dapper Don" John
Gotti, now serving a life prison term in Joliet, Ill.</LD>
<TE>   Also among the 17 indicted were two other Gotti relatives, as well
as Nasso's brother Vincent, and Frank "Red" Scollo, the president of
the International Longshoremen's Assn., Local 1814, described as a
mob family associate.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso, 49, of Staten Island, was charged with two counts,
conspiracy to commit extortion and attempted extortion of a figure in
the motion picture industry. Although prosecutors did not identify
the extortion target in the indictment, Nasso's lawyer said after
court that Seagal is the film figure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely Steven Seagal," said Nasso's lead attorney, Barry
Levin. "Steven Seagal has been seen talking to the grand jury."</TE>
<TE>   Nasso had a 15-year business relationship with Seagal until a
bitter falling-out. In March, Nasso filed a $60-million lawsuit
against the actor, alleging the star of such films as "Under Siege"
had backed out of a contract to perform in four movies. The two have
not spoken in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Seagal's attorney, Martin Pollner, would not confirm that Seagal
was the Hollywood figure allegedly targeted. In a statement, he said:
"The indictment against Mr. Nasso contains no allegation of any
wrongdoing or impropriety on the part of Mr. Seagal or any of their
former business ventures."</TE>
<TE>   Nasso's lawyer, Levin, said his client and the actor have been
negotiating the breakup of their partnership for nearly 18 months.
The attorney said the negotiations "didn't get anywhere." He
suggested that Seagal went to the FBI to retaliate against Nasso for
filing the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "Lo and behold, Seagal makes up this extortion allegation," Levin
said. "Why would any man who has a public lawsuit to vindicate his
claims ... attempt to extort money from the guy?"</TE>
<TE>   The indictment states that the extortion scheme ran from September
2000 to last month, and involved Gambino crime family captain Anthony
"Sonny" Ciccone with Nasso and two others, including Nasso's brother,
Vincent.</TE>
<TE>   They were accused of muscling in on the entertainment figure, "by
wrongful use of actual and threatened force, violence and fear."</TE>
<TE>   Ciccone, the indictment alleged, personally met "on more than one
occasion" with the entertainment figure to "extort hundreds of
thousands of dollars." On a taped phone call, Ciccone is heard
instructing Jules Nasso to demand $150,000 per film, court filings
said.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas DeMaria, executive director of the Waterfront Commission of
New York Harbor, said the case began as another in a string of
investigations over the years into corruption on docks where "the mob
infiltrates the union and holds key positions and then demands
extortion and kickbacks."</TE>
<TE>   Wiretaps revealed the extortion attempt, prosecutors said. "These
mob figures were discussing other ventures," DeMaria said, including
"extortion of a figure in the motion picture industry."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment does not indicate that the Gambino family received
any money from the film figure. But the filing alleges a plan by
Ciccone to "use his position as a captain in the Gambino organized
crime family to pressure the victim either to pay them money, or in
the alternative to include Julius Nasso in the victim's film
projects."</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion, Ciccone "excoriated Nasso" after hearing that
the producer had promised to share some of the extorted money with
others without "prior approval," prosecutors allege.</TE>
<TE>   In an expletive-filled diatribe caught on tape, Ciccone is quoted
as telling Julius Nasso: "Don't you ever, ever bring somebody in for
... nothing on something I'm ... doing ... without telling me first."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hantman, one of Nasso's attorneys, denied his client did
anything wrong. "We're looking forward to hearing the tapes."</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's arraignment in federal court in Brooklyn, Nasso
pleaded not guilty and was released on $1.5-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso got a foothold in Hollywood after serving as a production
assistant on Sergio Leone's film, "Once Upon a Time in America."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to producing seven of Seagal's films, including "Under
Siege 2" and "The Patriot," Nasso recently branched out to produce
other movies. They included "One Eyed King," a drama that starred
William Baldwin and Armand Assante, who portrayed a local mob boss,
and "Narc," a gritty drama exploring the drug underworld that starred
Ray Liotta, who also produced the movie. Tom Cruise's CW Productions
also was involved with "Narc" as an executive producer. The film is
expected to be released by Paramount Pictures later this year,
according to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise's producing partner, Paula Wagner, said Tuesday that
neither she nor the actor has ever met Nasso.</TE>
<TE>   Those who worked with Nasso in the entertainment industry said
they were surprised by the indictment. Producer Arnold Kopelson, who
worked with him on "Out for Justice," said: "[Jules] was always
extremely personable, very diligent in his attending to movie sets,
instrumental in setting up the New York part of the shoot. I liked
him very much and it was a pleasure dealing with him."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Alan Vinegrad in Brooklyn said the indictment stemmed
from a three-year investigation that uncovered "a stark picture of
the mob extortionate control over the waterfront in almost every
conceivable way."</TE>
<TE>   Busch reported from Los Angeles and Lieberman from New York.
Robert W. Welkos in Los Angeles also contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Oakley in Military Product Venture</HD>
<DH>Apparel: Sunglasses maker says it is working with the U.S.
armed forces to develop a boot and protective lens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oakley Inc., known for its trendy sunglasses, is developing two
products intended for the U.S. military, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   While offering only sketchy details about the project, the
Foothill Ranch-based company boasted about the venture on its Web
site, saying it is working with the military to produce "laser eye
protection and an alternative assault boot for elite special forces."</LD>
<LD>   Oakley has sold its products to the military for 15 years, but the
boot and laser lens will be the first products developed specifically
at the request of the armed forces, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   A deal has not yet been struck, but the company said a final
prototype of the boot is expected to be sent to the military by
September, and the lens should be ready shortly thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley declined to speculate on the financial implications of any
contract with the military. Analysts said they don't expect such a
contract to have a significant financial effect on Oakley. But having
the company's products identified with the armed forces would help
highlight the technical aspects of Oakley shoes and eyewear, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like it's going to be a big profit driver," said Michael
Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. "I think Oakley's
doing it because they can, and they want to be able to kind of
advertise how high-tech, cutting-edge and performance-driven the
company is."</TE>
<TE>   Oakley is known largely for its sunglasses, which are worn by
police officers, Olympic athletes and film stars.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the company has broadened its line to a wide
array of products, including apparel, shoes, watches and prescription
eyeglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley products purchased by the military in the past include
sunglasses, goggles, backpacks and jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Some products are modified for military use, the company said. For
example, the silver "O" logo may be darkened to gray or black.</TE>
<TE>   The boot being tested is lightweight and intended for missions
that last two to 10 hours, Oakley said. The lens is designed to
deflect laser light.</TE>
<TE>   The company declined to say how much the military would pay for
the products if an agreement were struck. The boot and laser lens
will not be for sale to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley's stock closed Tuesday at $17.93, down 27 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>

<HD>Standards for Organic Meat Under Review</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Critics say easing rules could render the term
meaningless for a wide range of products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Agriculture Department is considering a request that would loosen
standards for organic meat and poultry, a development that critics
say could cheat consumers and shake confidence in the small but
fast-growing organic food industry.</LD>
<LD>   Consumption of organic meat has grown rapidly in the last several
years, in part because of new rigorous federal standards that require
animals to be given organic feed--free of pesticides, antibiotics and
other chemicals.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers typically pay more for these products because of the
higher costs associated with these assurances.</LD>
<TE>   But now Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman, under pressure from
a delegation of Southern members of Congress, is considering a
request by a Georgia poultry company to allow it and other companies
to label their livestock as organic, even if their diet is not 100%
organic.</TE>
<TE>   The case, analysts say, shows that the new federal standards for
organic foods--being implemented in October--could be manipulated.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin, Ga.-based Fieldale Farms Corp., the company requesting
the waiver, said there isn't enough organic feed produced in the U.S.
to feed the 300,000 organic chickens it wants to turn out each week.</TE>
<TE>   "We can meet all the standards as to how birds are raised on the
farm, but we cannot continue to grow our market through feed
availability," said Stephen Gray, managing director of logistics for
Fieldale, which sells chickens mainly on the East Coast under the
Springer Mountain brand.</TE>
<TE>   Organic farming officials and large grain companies disagree. They
say there is more than enough pesticide-free grain available to meet
Fieldale's and other companies' demands--just not at a price Fieldale
wants to pay. Corn and soy--which most feed is made of--can cost two
or three times more in organic form than in conventional form.</TE>
<TE>   "Fieldale is just trying to secure the benefits of organic without
any of the responsibilities," said Lynn Clarkson, president of
Clarkson Grain, one of the country's largest organic grain suppliers,
who said he has told the company that Clarkson could supply it. In
addition to his company, "there are two or three other companies that
could cover their needs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Organic industry officials said that if Veneman grants the waiver
for livestock, it would render the term "organic" meaningless for a
wide range of products including meat, eggs, milk and butter, as well
as packaged products that contain dried versions of these foods.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1997, over 275,000 consumers told the U.S. Department of
Agriculture that they wanted strict requirements for organic
production and processing," said Katherine DiMatteo, executive
director of the Organic Trade Assn., representing the organic
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "USDA responded to that demand [with a federal organic rule] but
is now being lobbied to break consumers' trust," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Meat companies have been allowed to label their products as
organic since 1999. Although sales of these products represent less
than 1% of all meat sales, they are expected to grow 175% between
2000 and 2005, according to an Organic Trade Assn. survey.</TE>
<TE>   Large companies such as Tyson Foods Inc. have begun introducing
organic meat products after lining up organic grain suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   However, Tyson and other companies have not asked for a similar
waiver. They are boosting organic product sales as demand increases
and sourcing additional grain as they need it.</TE>
<TE>   Fieldale is "looking for any way they can work outside the
system," said Randy Duranceau, president of Petaluma Poultry, the
Petaluma, Calif.-based producer of the Rosie the Organic Chicken
brand.</TE>
<TE>   If Fieldale's request is granted, Duranceau said, it would provide
less incentive for grain growers to make the three-year transition to
becoming certified organic, making it harder for those who want to
follow the rules as written.</TE>
<TE>   Fieldale's Gray said his firm is not asking for a permanent
waiver, just a temporary order allowing it to use a mix of organic
and conventional feed until supplies become more readily available.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing we have asked for is more time to get the market
[for feed] in place," Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   There is currently no label that would allow for this partially
organic product. Gray suggested his company could use the term
"raised as organic" instead of using the official USDA organic seal.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Gray said, Fieldale is able to feed only about 20% of
its chickens organic feed. This product is marketed under an organic
label. However, the company's feed use has been repeatedly called
into question by the industry, allegations that the company denies.</TE>
<TE>   Fieldale's certifying group that was approved by USDA--Georgia
Crop Improvement Assn., or GCIA--has only Fieldale's producers as
members, according to the Organic Trade Assn. And other certifying
agencies, trade groups and feed companies said this agency's
standards do not mirror new federal standards, as most other state
programs do.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Clarkson said, GCIA has told him that existing policy
exempts Fieldale from purchasing all-organic grain if affidavits from
suppliers say none is available. So Clarkson and other critics
suspect that organic chickens from Fieldale could have been fed some
conventional grains.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with GCIA could not be reached for comment. Fieldale
officials have insisted that their chickens labeled organic are
getting a totally organic diet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just embarrassing for the industry," said Brian Leahy,
president of California Certified Organic Farmers, a Santa Cruz-based
accrediting organization.</TE>
<TE>   Veneman's office declined to discuss the matter, saying that the
issue is under review.</TE>
<TE>   However, a letter from Barbara Robinson, deputy administrator of
USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, suggests that USDA is giving
the matter serious consideration.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Fieldale obtained by The Times, Robinson said there
may arise "situations in which the market fails to result in an
efficient outcome, and where there is justification for a change in
the national standards to help the market perform more efficiently."</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials say such a move would be disastrous for an
industry just finding its footing.</TE>
<TE>   "If the secretary of Agriculture allows a special interest to
flout an organic rule that took 12 years to write, what hope do we
have for the credibility of USDA in the future?" said Bob Scowcroft,
executive director of the Organic Farming Research Foundation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after reporting a surprising 12% decline in sales for May,
General Motors Corp. said it was increasing cash rebates on pickups
and sport utility vehicles to match those from Ford Motor Co.</LD>
<LD>   Trucks are key to profits for Detroit's Big Three, and GM has
credited truck sales for growing its earnings this year. But GM's
full-size pickup sales fell 23% in May, while sales of Ford's
F-Series pickups fell 1.3% and sales of Chrysler Group's Dodge Ram
pickups increased 19%.</LD>
<LD>   GM said it was raising the rebates on mid-size SUVs by $750 to
$1,750. Rebates on most four-door, full-size pickups were raised to
$1,500 from $1,000, and rebates on other full-size pickups were
raised from $2,000 to $2,500.</LD>
<TE>   GM shares fell $1.80 to $59.45 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. plans to take a pretax charge of $2 billion to $2.5
billion, primarily in the second quarter, to cover job cuts from a
restructuring amid weak technology spending.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest computer maker said the majority of its
work-force reductions were complete. IBM said earlier that it cut
1,500 microelectronics jobs, pushing above 5,000 the estimated total
of jobs cut companywide.</LD>
<LD>   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM has quietly trimmed its 318,000-member work
force in recent weeks as Chief Executive Sam Palmisano tries to align
costs with customers' reduced technology spending. Other recent
actions aimed at cost cutting include IBM's decision to sell its
money-losing hard disk drive business to Hitachi Ltd..</LD>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, IBM shares closed at $79.31, up
$1.20--near lows set five years ago.</TE>

<LD>The largest smokeless tobacco company is violating a 1998 legal
settlement by targeting children in its ads, lawmakers who cited a
study by Massachusetts health officials said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. spent $9.4 million last year on
advertising in magazines that have substantial numbers of young
readers, up from $3.6 million in 1997, according to the report by the
Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program.</LD>
<LD>   "These results are troubling and indicate to us that UST is not in
compliance with the agreement it signed with the state attorneys
general," Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) and Sen. Richard Durbin
(D-Ill.) said in a letter to the National Assn. of Attorneys General.
UST Inc. is the holding company for U.S. Smokeless Tobacco.</LD>
<TE>   The lawmakers urged the attorneys general to take legal action
against the Greenwich, Conn., company.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Verheij, the company's general counsel, said he was
confident the manufacturer had not violated the 1998 agreement.
"We're very comfortable with the publications that we selected,"
Verheij said.</TE>
<TE>   UST shares closed up 83 cents at $38.60 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>The Federal Trade Commission said it has determined that sweetened
alcoholic beverages, such as Smirnoff Ice and Mike's Hard Lemonade,
aren't being marketed to minors.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC investigation followed a request by the Center for Science
in the Public Interest. The consumer group alleged that shoppers
easily mistake the beverages, found in stores beside orange juice and
sports drinks, for nonalcoholic drinks.</LD>
<LD>   FTC Consumer Protection Bureau Director Howard Beales said better
labels are needed to disclose alcohol content. Some labels are
unclear, and others don't disclose the alcohol content at all, he
said. Beales said he'll press his arguments with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hershey Foods Corp., unable to persuade striking workers to accept a
new contract calling for an increase in their health-care costs, said
it restarted production at one of its two shuttered candy plants with
nonunion workers.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations aimed at ending a five-week strike at two plants,
representing about a fifth of the largest U.S. chocolate maker's
total production, broke off early Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Investors have begun to worry that the maker of Kisses, Hershey's
bars and other confections will have difficulty meeting production
demands as it begins to ramp up for the critical back-to-school and
Halloween selling season. Hershey shares fell $1.38, or 2%, to $64.40
on the NYSE.</LD>

<LD>Walt Disney Co. sued a Swedish importer for copyright infringement
and requested the destruction of 25,000 teddy bears it says are
illegal replicas of Winnie the Pooh.</LD>
<LD>   The stuffed bears, which were made in China, were intercepted by
Swedish customs in April.</LD>
<LD>   Disney sued the importer, Malmoe-based Harlequin Trade, to prevent
the bears from being sold in Sweden, but the issue could be solved
outside of court if the importer agreed to destroy the bears,
attorney Ann-Charlotte Soederlund said.</LD>
<TE>   Harlequin Trade President Hans Brefelt declined to comment on the
lawsuit but said his company had a "mutual understanding" with
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Harlequin Trade reached a settlement with Disney
earlier this year after trying to import alleged replicas of two
other Pooh series characters, Piglet and Eeyore.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Disney said it plans to introduce a Disney-branded
Visa credit card with Bank One Corp. next January.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares closed down 26cents at $22.24 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>TRW to Spin Off Auto-Parts Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>TRW Inc., facing an $11.9-billion takeover bid from defense giant
Northrop Grumman Corp., filed Tuesday to spin off its auto-parts
unit.</LD>
<LD>   TRW valued shares of the unit at $1.5 billion, according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing. For each share of TRW
owned, the firm's shareholders would get one share of the automotive
business, which is the No. 2 maker of air bags and also produces seat
belts and braking systems.</LD>
<LD>   The spinoff comes as Northrop and other companies are holding
talks with TRW about a friendly takeover. Los Angeles-based Northrop,
the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, wants to buy TRW's
defense unit to expand its military space operations. Northrop has
said it would dispose of the auto business, which accounted for
two-thirds of TRW's $16.4 billion in sales last year.</LD>
<TE>   "If anything, it might expedite Northrop's plans," said Scott
Keller, the head of DealAnalytics.com, a New York-based firm that
analyzes mergers.</TE>
<TE>   TRW said in March that it planned to either sell or spin off the
Livonia, Mich.-based auto-parts business to become a stand-alone
defense contractor. Chief Executive Phil Odeen had said several
"well-capitalized" companies, which he wouldn't name, were interested
in buying the business.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, TRW has opted to spin off the unit in what it hopes will
be a tax-free deal for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The filing didn't specify a date for the spinoff. TRW said the
distribution could take place in six to nine months. Shares of the
new company would trade on the New York Stock Exchange under a symbol
that hasn't been picked. The auto unit is expected to have $2.8
billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   TRW Automotive also is selling an unspecified amount of
convertible preferred stock to outside investors as part of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   TRW is the No. 8 U.S. defense contractor and is a major
subcontractor on the U.S. missile-defense program. Northrop is the
maker of the Global Hawk aerial drone and is the largest military
shipbuilder.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Cleveland-based TRW rose 5 cents to $54.48 on the NYSE
in regular trading. The spinoff was filed after markets closed.</TE>

<HD>Group OKs TV-Piracy Safeguards</HD>
<DH>Technology: Divisions remain as studios try to keep digital
broadcasts from being transmitted over the Internet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An effort by Hollywood studios, technology companies and electronics
manufacturers to guard free television programs against piracy moved
forward this week, despite some major players' objections to the
process and the potential effect on consumers.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is how to change TV receivers, recorders and related
products so they won't enable digital TV programs to be retransmitted
over the Internet. Studios, manufacturers and tech companies started
the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group seven months ago to float
their ideas and search for common ground.</LD>
<LD>   The co-chairmen of the group issued their final report Monday,
saying "substantial agreement" had been reached on many key issues.
These included a requirement that any digital recording or
transmission of digital TV programs be protected with a pre-approved
scrambling technology.</LD>
<TE>   However, the report also indicates that no such agreement could be
reached on "a number of significant points," including the scope of
the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "There were at least as many significant issues left in
disagreement ... as were actually agreed upon," said Andy Moss,
technical policy director for the Windows division of Microsoft Corp.
"While a lot has been accomplished, there's still a big challenge in
front of us to do something useful with that information. There's no
consensus, and there are many ambiguities."</TE>
<TE>   Co-chairmen of the group said critics exaggerated the divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is substantial agreement on everything but a couple of
items," said Andy Setos, president of engineering for Fox Group.
Those "small gaps" can be bridged as discussions continue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have identified a number of technology solutions to
accomplish the goal," said Robert A. Perry, vice president of
marketing for Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America Inc. "We are not
really creating a standard. What we are creating are some
public-policy alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   The report moves on to another inter-industry group that will
discuss how to implement and enforce the proposed protections.
Ultimately, advocates say, either Congress or federal regulators will
have to adopt rules requiring digital TV products to include
technology to protect programs from being redistributed over the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The protections are important to Hollywood studios because online
piracy is burgeoning. If the studios aren't assured that their most
valuable programming will be protected, they won't make it available
to over-the-air broadcasters, said Jack Valenti, president of the
Motion Picture Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers also are concerned that the transition to digital
broadcasting is being hampered by studios withholding top-quality
programming. Stations were supposed to complete the switch by 2006,
but the deadline could be pushed back if consumers don't embrace the
new technology.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group said it
should have tried to achieve a formal consensus through open
meetings. Although supporters of the report said it took pains to
preserve consumers' recording rights, some consumer advocates argued
that the proposals would make TV programs recorded digitally onto DVD
incompatible with DVD players.</TE>

<HD>Kozlowski Charged With Tax Evasion</HD>
<DH>Indictment: Ex-CEO of Tyco pleads not guilty to dodging
$1million in New York City and state sales levies on art.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>L. Dennis Kozlowski, the mega-rich deal maker who built Tyco
International Ltd. into a huge conglomerate, was charged Tuesday with
evading more than $1million in taxes owed on purchases of artwork.</LD>
<LD>   In a 12-count indictment in New York State Supreme Court,
prosecutors alleged that Kozlowski engaged in an elaborate scheme
with several art dealers to avoid paying New York state and city
sales taxes on at least six paintings worth $13.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The paintings, including works by Claude Monet and Pierre Auguste
Renoir, were purchased by Kozlowski over the last 10 months.</LD>
<TE>   Under state law, people who buy goods in New York do not owe sales
taxes as long as the items are shipped out of the state for use
elsewhere. But Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau alleged that
Kozlowski sought to give the appearance that the paintings were
destined for Tyco's executive offices in New Hampshire when in
reality they were hanging on the walls of his opulent Fifth Avenue
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, Kozlowski had an art dealer ship five empty boxes
to New Hampshire, Morgenthau alleged. Another time, a painting
mounted in Kozlowski's apartment was taken down and driven to New
Hampshire. There, a Tyco employee signed for receipt of the painting,
which was then immediately trucked back to New York, the prosecutor
said.</TE>
<TE>   "For somebody who is highly paid to fail to pay over $1 million in
sales tax is a serious crime," Morgenthau said at a news conference.
"The city and state need the money and everybody has to pay their
fair share." The combined state and city sales tax rate is 8.25%.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the money Kozlowski used to buy some of the paintings
came from a fund Tyco set up to help employees exercise stock
options, prosecutors said. It let workers borrow money at no
interest. Kozlowski appears to have repaid some of the money,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   As chief executive of Tyco, Kozlowski was awarded a pay package
last year worth about $125 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski, who resigned from Tyco on Monday, pleaded not guilty to
charges of sales tax violations, falsifying business records,
tampering with physical evidence and conspiracy. Each charge is
punishable by up to four years in prison, except for the conspiracy
charge, which carries a maximum one-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski, 55, was released on a $3-million bond. Judge Arlene
Goldberg ordered him not to travel outside the country without court
permission and to surrender his passport to his attorney. His next
hearing is June 26.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, disputed the charges in
court, deriding them as "lacking in substance." Kaufman declined
further comment outside the courtroom, as did Kozlowski.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment of Kozlowski probably marks the denouement of one
of the most highflying, and controversial, careers in corporate
America in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   It also deals perhaps the most serious blow yet to the soiled
image of American CEOs.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, many CEOs, including Kozlowski, were lionized
as the personification of "new-economy" opportunity and success.</TE>
<TE>   But a flurry of financial scandals since late last year, including
the collapses of Enron Corp., Global Crossing Ltd. and Adelphia
Communications Corp., have been accompanied by charges of massive
accounting chicanery and executive self-dealing. The scandals have
left many CEOs looking like avatars of bull-market greed.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about athletes and sports stars, and do they have a
social duty to conduct themselves as role models for those who look
up to them," said Dov Seidman, who runs a Los Angeles consulting firm
that gives legal and ethical training to employees of major
corporations. "The same question is appropriately asked of CEOs, and
perhaps more so."</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski's indictment recalls the saga of New York hotel magnate
Leona Helmsley, who was at the center of a high-profile tax brawl in
the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Helmsley was convicted on 33 counts of tax evasion for claiming
$1.2 million in personal expenses incurred between 1983 and 1985 as
business deductions. Kozlowski's attorney, Kaufman, also represented
Helmsley.</TE>
<TE>   Morgenthau said his investigation began with a tip from the
state's banking department. It also was spurred by his concerns about
U.S. companies that designate offshore locales as their official
corporate headquarters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such headquarters shifts, which usually are made to minimize U.S.
taxes, often raise a red flag about a company, Morgenthau said.
Kozlowski relocated Tyco's nominal headquarters to Bermuda in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what role, if any, other Tyco workers may have
played in the Kozlowski episode.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco employees were ordered to sign false documents claiming to
have received artwork in New Hampshire, Morgenthau said. But he said
he didn't know if any Tyco employees were involved in the alleged
sales tax scheme. "The investigation is continuing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco spokesman J. Brad McGee said the company is cooperating with
Morgenthau's office, adding that "we have not been informed of any
employee being part of the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Kozlowski, the indictment charges four unnamed art dealers
and consultants with taking part in the fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Since the late 1990s, Kozlowski has been lauded as the architect
of a fast-growing leader of the new economy, as Tyco's sales rocketed
from $13 billion in 1997 to $36 billion last year, thanks to hundreds
of acquisitions. The company's products include electronic parts,
telecom systems, medical equipment and burglar alarms.</TE>
<TE>   But along the way Tyco was dogged by allegations that it used
accounting tricks to plump its earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's stock soared from $13 in 1996 to a peak of $62 in 2001. But
the price has collapsed this year amid mounting worries over Tyco's
debt load from its acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The shares, which dived $5.90 to $16.05 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Monday, inched up 72 cents to $16.77 on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>MCA Urged Workers to Lobby Against Artists Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief financial officer at MCA Records, a division of Vivendi
Universal, pressured employees to lobby California lawmakers to
oppose legislation that could open the door to free agency for
recording acts, documents show.</LD>
<LD>   The move occurred before the launch of a letter-writing campaign
this week staged by the California Music Coalition, an offshoot of
the Recording Industry Assn. of America, a Washington trade group
representing the world's five biggest record companies.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives from the RIAA set up tables this week at the
offices of Vivendi Universal, Sony Music, AOL Time Warner Inc., EMI
Group and BMG to help employees sign form letters asking lawmakers to
reject a bill that would repeal an amendment in the state labor code
that, in effect, extends contracts for recording acts longer than for
other workers.</LD>
<TE>   MCA is the only record label known to have pressured its employees
to comply with the letter-writing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal declined to comment. But some Vivendi executives
said privately that the letter-writing campaign was voluntary and
that employees participated because they wanted to be heard on the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday afternoon, record chiefs at nearly a dozen
Universal-owned record labels e-mailed thousands of employees, urging
them to participate in the "important" letter-writing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, MCA Records employees received a follow-up e-mail
from the label's chief financial officer, Paul Satenstein, telling
them to notify his assistant after completing their letters, "as she
will need to ensure everyone complies."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail ended with these words: "Thank you for complying."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, several Universal employees told The Times they were
"coerced" into participating in the campaign. One employee said he
and others "capitulated only because they were scared for their
jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The debate over the artists rights campaign stems from a growing
rebellion among music acts, many of whom have complained to lawmakers
that music corporations force them to sign unfair contracts that can
tie them up for their entire careers. The musicians also have
questioned the companies' accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, today attorney Johnnie Cochran and the Rev. Al Sharpton
are expected to launch an initiative in New York that would focus on
the free-agency issue for East Coast recording artists.</TE>

<HD>Liberty Media May Sell Part of Stake in Vivendi</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Cable firm joins two other major investors
considering a sale of the French company's stock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another sign of investor unease with Vivendi Universal, the French
entertainment giant said that Liberty Media Corp., one of its major
shareholders, may scale back its investment in the company.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi disclosed in a filing Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that Liberty Media, the Englewood, Colo.-based
cable TV company headed by billionaire John Malone, may sell part of
its 3.5% Vivendi stake in the next two years.</LD>
<LD>   Liberty joins two other top investors in Vivendi
Universal--Saint-Gobain and Royal Philips --that have indicated in
recent months that they may sell stock in the company.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi's largest shareholder, the Bronfman family, which is
unhappy over a 46% decline in its holdings this year, has said it is
reviewing its 5.3% stake in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Any pullback by Liberty and other top investors would only
complicate efforts by battered Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Marie
Messier to rebuild investor confidence in the company.</TE>
<TE>   The Paris company's stock has fallen this year because of concerns
about the company's direction and heavy debts from a spate of
acquisitions, including Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Messier emerged from a marathon meeting with frustrated
board members with a new layer of oversight by a committee that will
monitor his performance and plans to slash debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Liberty is a very respected company within the global media
sector," said Mark Harrington, a media industry analyst with J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. "A sale from them or any of these companies would
send a negative signal to the market."</TE>
<TE>   The market already reacted coolly to the filing. Vivendi's
American depositary receipts continued to slide on the New York Stock
Exchange, falling $1.17 to $28.88 on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty Media received 37.6 million shares in Vivendi last month
as payment for part of Vivendi's complex $11-billion acquisition of
the film and television businesses of Barry Diller's USA Networks
Inc. Liberty owned stakes in USA Networks plus Multithematiques, a
European TV production company.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Vivendi declined to comment on the filing.
Representatives of Liberty Media could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch Clients Get Better Ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. confirmed this week what many investors probably
suspected: The big brokerage is more bullish on the shares of its
corporate investment banking clients than other companies it covers.</LD>
<LD>   Under a new disclosure system negotiated with the New York state
attorney general, Merrill revealed that its 500 analysts have a
higher proportion of "buy" ratings on stocks of corporate clients
than on shares of companies the brokerage hasn't done business with
in the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill analysts rate 26% of clients' stocks "strong buy" compared
with 18% for all the stocks the analysts cover. They rate 40% of
clients' stocks "buy" compared with 36% for all companies.</LD>
<TE>   Merrill is disclosing the ratings distribution as part of its
agreement last month with Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer. Merrill also
agreed to pay a $100-million fine and create a panel to review rating
changes to settle Spitzer's claims that the firm's analysts misled
investors by recommending shares of companies largely or solely to
win or retain banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill spokeswoman Susan McCabe declined to comment on the
specifics of the ratings distribution. "A part of the analyst's role
is to assist in the capital-raising process by identifying companies
and transactions that are appropriate for and will benefit our
investor clients," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill analysts rate 40% of all companies "neutral," compared
with 30% of investment banking clients. Merrill has "sell" ratings on
6% of all companies it follows, compared with 4% of clients' shares.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill may award better ratings to shares of corporate customers
because "it can pick and choose its clients," said Georgetown
University finance professor James Angel. It may agree to underwrite
and advise on mergers only companies it believes have the best
prospects, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, "at face value, this looks rather suspicious," Angel
said. "Is Merrill tilting their research recommendations in favor of
clients?"</TE>
<TE>   When he announced his investigation on April 8, Spitzer released
e-mails from Merrill analysts, including former Internet analyst
Henry Blodget. The e-mails showed analysts disparaging companies they
recommended to investors, and indicated that banking relationships
influenced Merrill's ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks after Spitzer announced the probe, Merrill agreed to
disclose more information about conflicts of interest in its research
to avoid charges under New York's Martin Act, one of the nation's
most powerful anti-fraud laws.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle with
Spitzer, but Chief Executive David Komansky told employees last month
that the firm was tarnished by Spitzer's investigation.</TE>

<HD>Envoy Says U.S. Will Back New Afghan Union</HD>
<DH>Politics: With a council to select a transitional regime
about to begin, the diplomat aims to dispel the idea that the West is
in charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. forces are hunting Taliban stragglers, and international troops
have brought a fragile peace to this capital. But ultimately, Afghans
will have to unite if they can ever hope to be truly secure,
President Bush's special envoy said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A gathering next week of Afghan political leaders will be a vital
step toward creating that self-reliance, he said.</LD>
<LD>   In a cautious assessment of Afghanistan's progress through more
than five months of U.N.-brokered interim government, U.S. envoy
Zalmay Khalilzad assured his former countrymen here that Washington
will be respectful and supportive of whichever leader is chosen at
the loya jirga, or grand council, that is scheduled to convene
Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The Afghan-born envoy's arm's-length praise for interim Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai appeared aimed at dispelling the widespread
impression here that the West--with the U.S. first and foremost--is
trying to impose its political will on this country's future.
Although the international community has lavished attention and aid
on Karzai, making no secret of its hopes that he emerges from the
loya jirga as head of state, support among Afghans for the
charismatic 44-year-old ethnic Pushtun is far less certain.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is elected, we will be with him. We will respect him and
honor him and assist him in the way we have dealt with him before.
But if it's another choice, we will do the same. It's an Afghan
choice," said Khalilzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen who has served
Republican administrations since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States does not have a strategic interest in whether
Ahmad is the minister of health or Mahmoud is the minister of
education," he said, referring to common Afghan names. "That's not
our game. We're interested in people who can do their job and who
have the confidence of their own people.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals are not an issue of strategic value to the United
States," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The envoy's distancing of U.S. policy from the outcome of the loya
jirga could serve two objectives. First, it might weaken the argument
of Karzai's opponents that he is being installed by meddling foreign
powers. Second, it might protect the Bush administration from
accusations of fumbling in the unlikely event that Karzai is
sidelined by a rejection of U.S. influence.</TE>
<TE>   United Nations observers who have watched the selection of loya
jirga delegates have uncovered rampant corruption, intimidation and
vote-buying. Eight men vying for the right to represent their
districts were slain, and a special commission overseeing the
assembly had to intervene in 20 instances when threats and violence
marred the procedures. Some figures with dubious loyalties have
chosen to attend the gathering, though they might be regarded as
dangerously unsuitable to help select a leader with Afghanistan's
best interests at heart.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing the views of other foreign dignitaries and military
commanders, Khalilzad said that Taliban and Al Qaeda forces are on
the run but remain a danger to the fragile stability and recovery of
this country.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a threat. I suspect they're not happy about what's
happening in Afghanistan," Khalilzad said of the terrorist remnants,
many now believed to be hiding in the lawless tribal areas of
neighboring Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Al Qaeda is known to be seeking weapons of mass
destruction, Khalilzad said the possibility of future attacks by the
network cannot be ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist forces blamed for orchestrating the Sept. 11 attacks
no longer find reliable refuge in Afghanistan or operate in armed
formations, Khalilzad said, describing the U.S.-led battle here as in
"a manhunt phase."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the loya jirga site--a giant Oktoberfest beer tent lent by
Germany and erected on the soccer field of a bombed-out
college--spreads below towering mountains that encircle the battered
city and could provide vantage for any disgruntled ragtag fighter
with a rocket launcher.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Interior Minister Younis Qanooni said that ousted
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar is alive and known to return from
refuge in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "He comes and goes to his hide-outs in mountainous areas along the
border," Qanooni told journalists. Asked why Afghan or U.S. forces
don't arrest him, Qanooni replied that "unfortunately, those areas
are out of our access."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a pan-Arab newspaper quoted Omar as vowing war against
both the U.S. and Afghanistan's new leaders. "The future of America
in Afghanistan is fire, hell and certain loss," the paper quoted the
fugitive leader as saying during an interview.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials and foreign diplomats also worry about provocations
from regional warlords who have refused to accept the three-stage
process for restoring civilized rule to this country--a process that
a diverse gathering of Afghans mapped out near Bonn in December. The
interim authority headed by Karzai will be replaced by a transitional
administration to be decided upon by the loya jirga, and that will
give way to a popularly elected leadership in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Some warlords, such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, have vowed to disrupt
the U.N.-brokered procedures. Others have refrained from open threats
but are thought to be awaiting the results of the loya jirga before
deciding whether to align with the transitional government or wage
fresh warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Fears that attackers will try to disrupt the weeklong loya jirga
have confronted the international community with another awkward
task: beefing up security while avoiding what might be viewed as
further interference. The 18-nation International Security Assistance
Force has swelled to 5,000 strong as it prepares to transfer command
from Britain to Turkey this month, but it has pointedly left the
inside-the-tent work to Afghan police and a fledgling national guard
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Heeding the deep fractures separating Afghans by region, politics,
religion and ethnicity, Khalilzad said the loya jirga will have to
strike a delicate compromise between "continuity" with the interim
government and respect for the needs and interests of the country's
diverse regions.</TE>
<TE>   "This country's fragmented. What's needed is for a state to be
built that is a balance between the powers of the center, the
government that's being built and the regions," he said. "What that
exact balance will be is for the Afghans to decide."</TE>

<LD>   Farmers protesting the construction of an international airport
near Mexico City have released a Bulgarian engineer and five Mexicans
they took captive last week as punishment for conducting
airport-related studies on their land.</LD>
<LD>   Bulgarian Krassimir Kirilov and the five Mexicans were seized
Friday in San Salvador Atenco, outside the capital, while carrying
out studies for a Spanish company that plans to build three highways
as part of the new airport. About 150 machete-wielding farmers
released the captives in front of the Supreme Court in Mexico City.</LD>
<TE>   San Salvador Atenco is one of several communities in the area
known as Texcoco, where the six-runway, $2.3-billion airport is to be
built.</TE>

<HD>Chile's Storms Cause Chaos, Kill 9</HD>
<DH>Weather: Thousands flee homes. Copper production, stock
market are disrupted.</DH>

<DL>SANTIAGO, Chile</DL>
<LD>Serious storms killed nine people, forced thousands from their homes
and disrupted business in Chile on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Meteorologists said the torrential rains sweeping in from the
Pacific might be the beginning of a new El Nino weather phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   The Santiago stock exchange closed two hours early, and production
at a key copper mine was halted.</LD>
<TE>   The National Office of Emergencies said it was the worst flooding
in more than a century in Chile. More than 7.8 inches of rain had
fallen on Santiago since Sunday, according to meteorologists,
two-thirds the capital's average rainfall for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been up all night fighting against this," said homeowner
Claudio Rojas, sweeping rainwater from his house in a low-lying
neighborhood near the Santiago airport.</TE>
<TE>   Police helicopters plucked stranded residents from flooded rural
areas northwest of Santiago. Treetops and roofs poked through the
brown water.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials said the homes of 33,000 people in central
Chile had been seriously damaged. Several thousand people took
shelter in schools and public buildings.</TE>
<TE>   A blackout caused by the storms halted copper production at the
Los Bronces mine, owned by a unit of Exxon Mobil Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market closed early for a second straight session, and
trading in the Chilean peso also was limited. The currency slid
0.26%, partly because of a fall in the Brazilian real.</TE>
<TE>   Weather experts said the Chilean storms could be a sign that the
El Nino phenomenon, which begins in the Pacific, is taking shape.</TE>

<DL>ZIARA, Syria</DL>
<LD>A dam collapsed in northern Syria and flooded several villages
Tuesday, killing at least two people, residents and officials said.</LD>
<LD>   After the Zeyzoun Dam burst, villagers said some areas were
submerged under 13 feet of water. But the flood receded quickly, and
a few hours later the water level was down to about 4 inches.</LD>
<LD>   The dam, built in 1996, burst near Idlib, about 160 miles north of
Damascus, the Syrian capital. It is on the Orontes River.</LD>
<TE>   In the nearby village of Ziara, residents described a sudden
deluge of water flooding homes and farmland shortly after 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Yasser Ibrahim, 33, a farmer, said two women were killed by the
flooding. "The water took them," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Packs Carrots for South Asia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Russians and Chinese haven't been able to do it. Neither have the
other Asian nations meeting this week in Kazakhstan. So what can the
United States bring to the crisis between India and Pakistan to
ensure that the two nuclear powers don't go to war?</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials were facing that question after Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin failed Tuesday during an Asian security summit in
Kazakhstan to persuade Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to hold face-to-face talks to
head off a possible war over the disputed region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   Top U.S. diplomatic and defense officials are heading for the
South Asian region to take up where Putin left off. They will wield
America's unparalleled influence as the world's sole superpower--and
bank on the fact that neither side can refuse to listen. That clout
will be backed up with hard intelligence about what's really
happening among forces on the ground and alarming projections about
what could lie ahead if war erupts, according to Bush administration
officials.</LD>
<TE>   But when Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage and Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld make stops on the volatile subcontinent
over the next five days, they'll also be asking both countries to
make tough choices--and holding out carrots if they cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Their strongest message will be for Pakistan, where both will
begin their missions. Armitage, known for his blunt talk and
intricate knowledge of South Asia, intends to lay it on the line
Thursday with Musharraf, U.S. officials say. He'll call for an
immediate end to infiltration by Muslim extremists across the
cease-fire line in Kashmir and a clampdown on the staging areas they
use for attacks on targets in the Indian-controlled portion of the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Promises of Gains</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the U.S. will tell Musharraf that he stands to make
gains--not necessarily in Kashmir but on other fronts.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll have a chance for a new position in the world, as leader of
the moderate Muslim world, and for new economic assistance through
continuing debt relief ... that we can offer him," said a senior
State Department official who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can work with him on ending support for violence, then
that's the kind of country we can do business with. So this is a
chance for Pakistan to achieve its own goals and in the process make
itself a respected member of the international community," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials saw a glimmer of hope Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have some indications that Pakistani actions go beyond
words," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   But he added, "At this point, we are not prepared to say that we
have seen the cessation [of extremist activity] that we are all
looking for and that President Musharraf has promised."</TE>
<TE>   On their second stops, Armitage and then Rumsfeld will urge India
to show restraint while giving Pakistan a chance to rein in militants
and cut their access to Kashmir. Once that process shows significant
progress, India should reciprocate by de-escalating its military
readiness in the area, the U.S. officials will advise.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries have a total of about 1 million soldiers
positioned along the 1,800-mile border.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage and Rumsfeld will concentrate on these delicate initial
steps while outlining possible follow-up measures if the two nations
adhere to efforts to defuse hostilities, the senior State Department
official said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has indicated that the U.S.
will try to prod the two Asian nations into a face-to-face political
dialogue on the future of Kashmir, a region over which they have
already fought two wars. India does not want the United States or any
other party to intervene in an attempt to mediate the issue, while
Pakistan is anxious to have Washington play a direct role, as it has
in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "There are various sensitivities. The Indians do not want us to be
a mediator, but they want U.S. help to facilitate their discussions
with Pakistan," said the senior State Department official. "We would
like to see a dialogue with all issues on the table, and we might
even be able to contribute some ideas."</TE>
<TE>   For the U.S., the hardest task--and the key to ensuring that
tensions don't quickly flare up again--will be getting Musharraf to
hold the line against militants.</TE>
<TE>   In a nationwide speech heralded by U.S. officials as courageous,
Musharraf pledged in January to end extremist activities both at home
and in neighboring regions. And Pakistan followed up with the arrest
of at least 2,000 Islamic militants in what was its biggest crackdown
in decades.</TE>
<TE>   An Effort Not Sustained</TE>
<TE>   But the effort was not sustained, many extremists were released,
and raids on Indian territory in Kashmir began again this spring. The
Muslim militants are seeking independence for the predominantly
Islamic region or the union of the Indian-controlled section with
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Regional experts say Musharraf must be told that he can no longer
take half-measures--and that the only way out of the crisis is if he
takes the same tough stance toward militants in Kashmir that he did
against pro-Taliban extremists along his nation's border with
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. needs to clarify how Pakistan's failure to fully crack
down on extremists will also fail to lead to a resolution on Kashmir,
according to Michael Krepon of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a
Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "This policy is failing Pakistan. It's not helping Kashmiris or
rescuing Kashmir from India's grasp.... If it continues, it could
spark a nuclear exchange and wipe out millennia of Muslim
accomplishments," Krepon said.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "And if Pakistan doesn't cross the nuclear threshold and
they find themselves in a conventional war, it will lose that war,
leaving the army discredited and the country destabilized. Finally,
if Pakistan fights a war over Kashmir, it will fight it alone."</TE>
<TE>   If Pakistan cracks down on the extremists, however, Krepon said
the Bush administration can use its leverage with India to encourage
a dialogue on Kashmir, as well as resumption of diplomatic ties and
of trade and transportation links vital to both sides.</TE>
<TE>   On an issue assuming increasing prominence, the U.S. could also
encourage India to take action on human rights concerns in Kashmir.
Key Indian police units, some made up of former Kashmiri militants
who changed sides, have been behind a good deal of the abuse in the
region, Krepon said. These units could be disbanded and individual
soldiers accused of rapes and other violations prosecuted as a way to
show that India takes basic rights seriously, a key demand by
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Confidence</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe that India and Pakistan are anxious to find
a face-saving way to avoid a full-scale conflict and that neither
wants to use its nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I do have confidence that the leadership in those two countries
are fully respectful of the power of the weapons and the importance
of their being managed and controlled in a way that reflects that
fact," Rumsfeld said Tuesday at a Pentagon briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he will also focus on the impact of the
Indo-Pakistani hostilities on the U.S.-led campaign to eliminate the
Al Qaeda terrorist network and its leaders. Pakistan's priority has
shifted from its western border with Afghanistan to its eastern
border with India.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld acknowledged Tuesday that the South Asian crisis has been
a distraction from the war on terrorism. But he also expressed
confidence that war between India and Pakistan can be avoided.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is, and certainly my hope is, that two countries as
important as they are will figure out ways to get from where they are
to where the world would like them to be--which is in a less tense
situation," Rumsfeld said.</TE>

<HD>Hong Kongers Mark 13th Anniversary of Tiananmen</HD>
<DH>China: In holding vigil, residents of territory exercise
freedoms that mainlanders don't have.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Hong Kong residents put aside World Cup frenzy for a few
hours Tuesday to join a candlelight vigil marking the 13th
anniversary of the military assault that crushed democracy
demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</LD>
<LD>   As patriotic songs reverberated amid the surrounding skyscrapers,
participants held white candles and filed solemnly into a paved plaza
in downtown Victoria Park, exercising rights of speech and assembly
forbidden to Chinese on the mainland.</LD>
<LD>   Local media reported that 10,000 Hong Kongers showed up to mourn
the crackdown that killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed
demonstrators on June 4, 1989. Official attendance figures were not
available. Last year, 40,000 participated.</LD>
<TE>   "True patriotism is when you stand up for what you believe in,
even if it costs you your life. I really respect the Tiananmen
demonstrators, and I come each year to bow to them," said Stephanie
Cheung, holding one flickering candle among thousands.</TE>
<TE>   In the Chinese capital, where the regime suppresses all efforts to
mark the anniversary, security was tighter than usual around
Tiananmen Square. But there were no reports of protests there or
elsewhere on the mainland, where most attention appeared focused on
the national team's debut in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong's annual June 4 rallies began in 1989, when more than 1
million residents gathered in protest. With the number dwindling to
the thousands, lawmaker and rally organizer Szeto Wah urged those
attending to educate the next generation to "take up the baton of
democracy" to ensure that the deaths of the protesters are not
forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "We must persist to the end, no matter how difficult the path," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Amid extensive World Cup coverage in the Ming Pao newspaper was a
half-page memorial ringed in black that read, "The memory of June 4
will remain forever." It was signed by dozens of churches, activist
groups and individuals.</TE>

<HD>Putin Fails in India-Pakistan Peace Bid</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Russian president meets with leaders of two
nuclear rivals at security summit. Direct negotiations don't appear
likely soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALMATY, Kazakhstan</DL>
<LD>Russian President Vladimir V. Putin's attempt to play peacemaker
between India and Pakistan fell flat Tuesday, leaving the two
nuclear-armed South Asia neighbors still on the brink of war over
Kashmir with no prospect of direct negotiations any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   Taking advantage of an Asian security meeting in Kazakhstan to
press the world's plea for a reduction in tensions, Putin held
back-to-back meetings with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee that lasted a total of
three hours late Tuesday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The two countries reportedly have massed 1 million troops on their
border. Putin's discussions were aimed at drawing them into some kind
of negotiating process with himself as mediator to cool tempers and
help de-escalate the situation.</LD>
<TE>   But in the end, the Russian leader was forced to tell reporters
gathered outside a mountain retreat where the discussions were held
that he had achieved little, aside from what he considered to be
positive signals.</TE>
<TE>   "The necessary conditions for holding meetings [to negotiate] are
viewed differently by the two sides so far," Putin said. "But a
desire for direct contacts is there. And what is just as important,
both have emphasized that they do not intend to use force to solve
the problems that have accumulated over many years.</TE>
<TE>   "To my mind," he added, "this is a very important thing."</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Vajpayee told a news conference here that India would
consider working jointly with Pakistan to monitor the Line of Control
that divides the two nations in Kashmir, Associated Press reported.
There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan to the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over the mainly Muslim
region of Kashmir. Militants have been seeking to either create an
independent Kashmir or unite the Indian-controlled sector with mainly
Muslim Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday evening, Musharraf described a Russian proposal to
bring him and Vajpayee to Moscow for further talks. But the idea
apparently failed to take off.</TE>
<TE>   At a packed news conference, the Pakistani president said he had
accepted the Russian invitation at once and hoped that India's leader
would follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it is bilateral or trilateral, we are in for any kind of
mediation," Musharraf said. "It depends on Prime Minister Vajpayee
whether he would like to attend."</TE>
<TE>   But after Vajpayee emerged from his talks with Putin, an Indian
spokesman indicated that the prime minister had not been invited to
Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   According to Russian and Indian sources here, the Indian stance
against direct talks was so strong that ultimately Putin issued no
new invitation to Vajpayee. Rather, Putin told reporters, he hoped to
take advantage of a previous Indian invitation for him to travel to
New Delhi later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Putin tried to put the best face on his talks here in the former
Kazakh capital.</TE>
<TE>   "The very fact that the two leaders agreed to come to Almaty, and
then came, means a great deal and instills great hope," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, a pall hung over the conference's end, heightened by
Musharraf's refusal--as in the past--to categorically rule out the
use of nuclear weapons by Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has an estimated 25 to 50 nuclear warheads, while India
is believed to possess 100 to 150, according to Jane's Strategic
Weapon Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the efforts toward peace, fresh artillery duels and gunfire
broke out Tuesday across the Line of Control that divides Indian and
Pakistani areas of Kashmir. There were unconfirmed reports of deaths
on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Putin's efforts to negotiate between the two South Asian leaders
should be viewed as a failure, one Russian analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing was achieved. The situation hasn't changed an iota from
where it was yesterday," was the dour assessment Tuesday by Andrei A.
Piontkovsky, a Moscow-based political analyst with the Independent
Institute for Strategic Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the obvious pro-Indian stance of the Russian Foreign
Ministry, today's meeting demonstrated that the Russian Foreign
Ministry and President Putin himself have zero influence over India,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   With the apparent failure of the Russian peace effort, the next
mediation effort will be taken up by the Americans. Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage
are scheduled to visit South Asia in coming days.</TE>
<TE>   The problem facing Putin at the Almaty conference was that India
and Pakistan had staked out their positions well before their
meetings with the Russian leader.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf repeatedly has stated that Pakistan is not tolerating
any terrorism across the Line of Control aimed at the Indian-held
portion of Kashmir or at India itself. He says that Vajpayee's
government, therefore, has no reason to threaten his country but
instead should begin a dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Vajpayee says that his nation has yet to see any
convincing changes on the ground and that talks with the Pakistani
president won't make sense until India is convinced that Musharraf is
keeping his promises to stop terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The two leaders were among the 16 participants in the first
Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia,
which adopted a declaration condemning "all forms and manifestations
of terrorism" and promising "to strengthen cooperation and dialogue."
But even though they sat for hours in the same room and then lunched
together, Musharraf and Vajpayee managed to avoid talking to each
other during the two days.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he had met or had any contact with Vajpayee,
Musharraf huffed: "No, I didn't meet him. And no, I didn't shake
hands with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I had shaken his hands once before, and I did not get any
reciprocation," he said. "Maybe he should have shaken hands with me
this time. Maybe I was waiting for him."</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee did not hold a news conference here. But his
representative, Indian National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra,
confirmed that there had been no personal contact between the prime
minister and Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have had another handshake here, but it would not have
been any different on the ground situation unless President Musharraf
and the government of Pakistan implement what they have promised to
do publicly" and put an end to cross-border attacks, Mishra said.</TE>
<TE>   Kazakh President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, who was the moving force
behind the summit, said he was not surprised that the talks between
India and Pakistan had proved so difficult, but he said the matter
had to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "The India-Pakistan problem arouses concern all over the world,"
he said. "The international mass media is already counting the dead
in case of a nuclear exchange between them."</TE>
<TE>   Like Putin, he said, he spent hours with the two leaders trying to
defuse the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I can say I achieved for sure is as follows: The
Indian prime minister told me that if the Pakistani president takes
one step [toward peace], he was ready to take two in return. I passed
it on to Musharraf."</TE>

<HD>Arafat, CIA Chief Discuss Security</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian leader's plan to reform the bloated
system leaves his people and Israel skeptical. In latest violence, a
bus explodes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>At least 14 people were reported killed early today when a car packed
with explosives blew up alongside a crowded bus during the morning
rush hour in north-central Israel, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens more were wounded in the blast, which came just hours after
CIA Director George J. Tenet met in the West Bank with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat to discuss ways to reshape the
Palestinians' tangled and ineffective security forces. U.S. officials
are demanding, among other things, that Palestinian police agencies
fight terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But in northern Israel this morning, the scene was a familiar one
of carnage. Bus No. 830, many of its passengers soldiers on their way
to work, was making its daily cross-country run from Tel Aviv on the
coast to Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee. At the Megiddo junction
about halfway along the route, a car presumably driven by a
Palestinian suicide bomber sidled up to the bus and blew up, police
said.</LD>
<TE>   Army Radio reported 14 people killed. Many of the dead were
believed to have been soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The car was a crumpled mass of metal, and the bus fared even
worse; little was left of it beyond a charred skeleton that was still
smoldering 11/2 hours after the blast. Bloodied debris was strewn
along the highway's median; emergency workers lined up black body
bags on the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   "The scene is very serious, this is an incident with a very large
number of casualties," northern Israeli police commander Yaakov
Borovsky told reporters. "A car drove alongside a bus, and the result
was very, very serious."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his security Cabinet
to discuss the attack, which overshadowed Tenet's efforts to defuse
tensions here.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the bombing, and as Tenet met with Arafat at his
Ramallah compound still littered with sandbags from this spring's
prolonged siege, neither Palestinians nor Israelis held out much hope
that the famously autocratic Palestinian leader would institute
profound reforms in his security bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat won't even change his jacket," said a Palestinian
government minister who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You think
he will change his Cabinet?"</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that the security apparatus has grown bloated,
Arafat agreed to trim the services from about a dozen branches to
six. He also called up a 73-year-old onetime general, Abdel Razak
Yehiyeh, from retirement to become security chief. Before the 1993
Oslo peace accords led to the creation of a Palestinian government,
Yehiyeh headed the exiled Palestinian National Army in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of the aging general over younger, more ambitious
upstarts such as Mohammed Dahlan, security chief for the Gaza Strip,
raised concerns that Arafat plans to keep tight control over the
forces by appointing a weak deputy.</TE>
<TE>   "Reforms that have no substantial change in strategy and policy
are worthless," said Raanan Gissin, spokesman for Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Both in Israel and in Ramallah, Arafat's headquarters, the
Palestinian security services are already regarded with varying
degrees of cynicism.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's government complains that Palestinian intelligence
officers are more interested in helping militants wage renegade
attacks on Israel than in cracking down on political violence.</TE>
<TE>   And on Palestinian turf--where suicide bombers often are
celebrated as martyrs and Israel reviled as an enemy--security forces
are often written off as corrupt and even, at times, as acquiescent
to Israeli wishes. Beginning in 1995, Palestinians watched their
security officers patrol alongside Israeli soldiers. Many
Palestinians were also disappointed when the security apparatus
failed to rise up in an organized fashion against Operation Defensive
Shield, Israel's five-week military incursion this spring into the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   In the thick of some of the region's worst violence in years,
Arafat spent five weeks besieged by Israelis in his sprawling
Ramallah compound during the incursion. The main entrance is still
choked shut by mounds of dirt and crushed cars, so a convoy of
American trucks made its way past a swarm of chanting protesters
Tuesday morning to the back door. Tenet disappeared inside for a
three-hour, closed-door meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat reportedly urged the CIA director to put a halt to Israel's
crackdown on Palestinian territory. For months, soldiers have
systematically clamped Palestinian towns under curfew, rounded up
hundreds of suspects and searched homes in an effort to head off
suicide bombings and find militants. Palestinian authorities argue
that the security apparatus can't do its job when the region is
paralyzed by roadblocks and lockdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has been struggling to coax the two factions back toward
peace negotiations but to little effect. Sharon, who is due in
Washington next week, has said that meaningful reform of the
Palestinian Authority is impossible as long as Arafat stays in power.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Sharon agreed to erect a series of walls, electronic
fences and razor wire along a stretch of the boundary between Israel
and the West Bank. The idea of a fence has long been anathema to
nationalistic Israelis and Palestinians alike. Israelis fear that
they will cut themselves off from lands they've worked for years to
settle, while Palestinians regard the fence as a further blow to
their freedom of movement.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions continued Tuesday in the countryside. In a village near
Hebron in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers killed a 16-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokeswoman said a crowd of villagers had attacked the
soldiers with rocks, and the Israelis fired into the ground to
disperse the crowd. The bullets sometimes ricochet, said the
spokeswoman, Yael Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian witnesses said the boy was standing quietly outside
his house when he was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Palestinians along a Hebron roadside threw
rocks at a pair of Israelis driving by. The driver was clobbered in
the head, lost control of the car and crashed into a post. The pair
survived the wreck, but their story was a reminder of yet another
sticking point: the seething resentment between Palestinians and
Jewish settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson in Jerusalem contributed to
this report.</TE>

family and subjects as four days of pomp and pop-filled Golden
Jubilee celebrations drew to a close Tuesday on a tidal wave of
emotional support.</LD>

cheering and singing patriotic songs as the monarch, 76, smiled and
waved from the balcony of Buckingham Palace at the climax of the
festivities.</LD>
<LD>   She even made an encore appearance to satisfy the crowd of all
ages and from all corners of the world before rain--which had
threatened all day--came down.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we can look back with measured pride on the history of
the last 50 years," the queen said earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Gratitude, respect and pride. These words sum up how I feel about
the people of this country and the Commonwealth, and what this Golden

<HD>Deeper U.S. Role in Asia Urged</HD>
<DH>Philippines: American commanders advise the Pentagon chief
to widen the Army's anti-terror effort, but he has doubts about costs
and dangers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday that he has
resisted authorizing increased U.S. military activity in the
Philippines despite repeated recommendations by senior commanders
that American soldiers become more directly involved in the search
for Abu Sayyaf guerrillas holding two American hostages.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld said he has not decided whether to extend a joint
military exercise, begun Jan. 15, in which Army Green Berets are
training the Philippine military in a combat zone on Basilan island,
home to an estimated 80 to 100 of the Muslim separatist fighters.</LD>
<LD>   However, with the mission scheduled to end next month, Rumsfeld
expressed concern that U.S. soldiers might be put at risk on a
mission that could simply prompt the rebels to move their operations
elsewhere. Abu Sayyaf guerrillas have been linked to Osama bin
Laden's terrorism network.</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's reluctance to expand the Green Berets' mission
highlights the limitations of the Bush administration's deployment of
forces to combat terrorism, even in areas where the United States has
enduring relationships.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Saturday to West Point graduates, President Bush
reiterated his view that an expansive war on terrorism across
international frontiers is necessary. Although the U.S. presence has
quelled Abu Sayyaf's activities, according to Philippine commanders,
Pentagon officials have determined that simply being there is not
enough. That realization leaves the U.S. with a choice: Keep troops
in trouble spots, at the risk of American lives, or leave and
possibly embolden terrorists who are in hiding.</TE>
<TE>   "You can improve the situation in one place by your presence, but
unless you get the terrorists, you have not improved the situation
net in the world," Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon briefing. "And there
has been very little of getting terrorists in the Philippines thus
far."</TE>
<TE>   The mission--to train the Philippine army at the battalion level,
which includes hundreds of soldiers--is restricted to Basilan island
and the nearby port of Zamboanga. U.S. soldiers in the southern
province of Mindanao, which includes the island and the port, are
prevented from going on smaller patrols with Philippine soldiers in
search of the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Philippine Constitution prohibits foreign troops from
engaging in combat in the nation except in self-defense, the mere
presence of the Americans could encourage an attack by rebels,
Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior military officials have recommended expanding U.S.
participation in the effort to track down the rebels who kidnapped
American missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham in May 2001. Among
those calling for a greater U.S. role are the former head of the U.S.
Pacific Command, Adm. Dennis Blair, and his replacement, Adm. Thomas
Fargo.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld acknowledged Tuesday that Marine Gen. Peter Pace, vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was at his side for the
briefing, also recommended a wider role for the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army officials in the Philippines said recently that they
were prepared to become more involved if they were asked. They take
credit for helping to shut down Abu Sayyaf's activities on Basilan,
including massacres of villagers who refused to assist the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "They're nonfunctional as an organization," U.S. Army Brig. Gen.
Donald Wurster, the commander of U.S. soldiers in the region, said in
a recent interview. "As I look around, I can see the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Expanding the mission would require the approval of both
countries' defense officials.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in his most candid statements to date on the military
exercise, Rumsfeld indicated that he saw little reason to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "I need a greater comfort level that I understand what I am
recommending to the president this country get involved in--in terms
of people, in terms of dollars and in terms of potential benefit," he
said.</TE>

<HD>2 Teens on Bus Killed in Thailand</HD>
<DH>Asia: Gunmen open fire on vehicle near Myanmar border,
wounding 15.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BANGKOK, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Three masked gunmen opened fire on a Thai school bus near the border
with Myanmar on Tuesday, killing two teenage students and wounding 15
others.</LD>
<LD>   A senior Thai defense official said the shooting in Ratchaburi
province, about 12 miles from Myanmar, was probably carried out by
one of Myanmar's ethnic minority guerrilla groups and may have been
intended to "create more misunderstanding" between the two countries.</LD>
<LD>   The school bus was carrying about 20 students when it came under a
hail of bullets as it was climbing a steep road in the mountainous
jungle district of Suan Phung.</LD>
<TE>   "I heard a series of loud shots, and many of my friends were hit,"
said Siriporn Sornpad, 13. "My school uniform was splattered with
their blood."</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen "wore black masks and green jungle uniforms," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of her friends, a boy and a girl, were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Among the wounded, all between 13 and 17 years old, nine were in
critical condition, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I first thought it was firecrackers going off, and realized later
that they were real bullets when I saw blood on my friends," one boy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police and local officials said the gunmen looked like rebels from
Myanmar's Karen ethnic minority, and they apparently escaped back
into Myanmar. A spokesman for the main Karen rebel group fighting
Myanmar's government denied involvement and speculated that Myanmar's
military junta may have been behind the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Thai soldiers and border police assisted by
helicopters were searching for the gunmen in the area near the
attack, said Thailand Deputy Defense Minister Yuthasak Sasiprapha.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who has been trying to smooth
ruffled relations with Myanmar, said evidence pointed to armed
militias operating on the border and not Myanmar troops.</TE>

<HD>Bishops Call for Abuse Crackdown</HD>
<DH>Religion: National group will consider a proposal to oust
new offenders but allow one molestation in the past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic leaders called Tuesday for unprecedented national
safeguards to protect minors from sexual abuse by priests, but
stopped short of an across-the-board zero-tolerance policy.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal--intended to stem a sexual abuse scandal that has
rocked the church since January--calls for defrocking any priest who
commits an act of sexual abuse after the new policy takes effect. A
priest with an incident in his past could stay on if he were found to
have molested only a single child, had undergone psychological
treatment, had been found not to be a pedophile and had the backing
of a lay-dominated sexual-abuse committee that heard from both the
victim and the priest. The priest's record would be disclosed to
those involved in his new ministry.</LD>
<LD>   Advocates for sexual-abuse victims remained skeptical Tuesday,
saying they wanted to see if the nation's bishops adopt the plan next
week. But other critics said the proposal was hard-hitting and
comprehensive, and in some cases more than they expected from a
church whose American leaders have often reacted defensively.</LD>
<TE>   The document, which contains an unusually candid apology from
bishops, was unveiled by the Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse of the
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The full conference meets in
Dallas next week.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by at least two-thirds of the 285 bishops, the
initiative would eclipse all previous efforts by the church to rein
in sexual abuse, a protracted scandal that has escalated into what
the church now views as its greatest crisis in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   While past recommendations have been largely general in nature,
the new plan calls for specific steps which all 194 U.S. dioceses
will be expected--but not technically forced--to take.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal also calls for greater involvement by lay Catholics
in developing and carrying out sexual-abuse prevention policies in
local dioceses, police background checks of church employees who work
with children and youth, and an end to confidentiality agreements
with victims unless the victims insist on privacy. Local sexual-abuse
advisory committees would also review complaints made against
priests. A new national Office for the Protection of Children and
Youth would be created to assist local bishops in implementing the
plan in their local dioceses--and issue annual public reports
tracking a bishop's compliance.</TE>
<TE>   The most contentious issue was what to do about priests who
committed a single act of sexual abuse in the past but have had a
flawless record since then. It illustrated tension between the
church's growing recognition that it needs harsher policies and
Christian virtues of forgiveness and redemption.</TE>
<TE>   The draft's apology from bishops--some of whom have outraged
rank-and-file Catholics by transferring sexually abusive priests from
parish to parish--says:</TE>
<TE>   "We express great sorrow and profound regret for what the Catholic
people have had to endure. We are profoundly sorry for the times when
we have deepened its pain, by what we have done or by what we have
failed to do. We reach out to those who suffer. We apologize to them
and offer our help for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Compliance is voluntary because each diocese reports to the
Vatican, not the national bishops group. Archbishop Harry J. Flynn,
chairman of the committee that authored the plan, said bishops will
send the plan to the Holy See.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican has issued mixed signals: Pope John Paul II told U.S.
cardinals in April that "there is no place in the priesthood or
religious life for those who would harm the young." But after the
Rome summit, an Italian Jesuit magazine reviewed in advance by the
Vatican said bishops should not refer an abuse allegation to police
until the bishop had reached a "moral certainty" that the priest was
guilty. The article said that if a priest is reassigned after a
molestation incident, his past should not be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America, which
has been critical of the bishops' past responses and recently called
for a zero-tolerance policy for abusive priests, praised the
recommendations. Bishops have "done a very good job. It's a tough
document," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Thomas Doyle, who in 1985 wrote a report urging the
church to address a then-budding sexual-abuse scandal, said the new
document's contrition "is certainly extraordinary.... [but] there
have been so many promises made," that even if one or two bishops
continue to treat victims with hostility, "that will blow the bottom
out of any credibility they wish to restore."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Christine Schenk, executive director of Cleveland-based
FutureChurch, which calls for married and women priests, said the
plan is "a very good beginning."</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds to me like they've done a good job of hearing what the
grass-roots Catholics are saying," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the beginning of the year, bishops have been forced to
resign, at least 225 of the nation's 46,000 Catholic priests have
been dismissed or quit, and civil suits involving millions of dollars
in damages have been filed in courts from coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal also prompted a rare meeting at the Vatican between
Pope John Paul II and U.S. cardinals and officers of the bishop's
conference.</TE>
<TE>   The draft is subject to amendment in Dallas. "This is not written
in stone, nor is it a final judgment," said committee Chairman Flynn,
archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis, who nonetheless clearly hoped
the committee's draft would survive largely intact.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he expects lively debate by bishops in Dallas,
particularly over the rule allowing a priest with a past case of
sexual abuse to conditionally continue in ministry, which he said was
his committee's "most challenging debate."</TE>
<TE>   "The committee is well aware that many strongly believe that there
should be no such provision," Flynn said Tuesday. But he said "a
large enough minority" of bishops, experts and people in the pew had
asked for some "flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   "We need to believe in the possibility of conversion and we need
to believe in the possibility that people can grow, people can turn a
corner," Flynn said. "Psychologically, medically, we would be fools
if we were to say that someone cannot grow."</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy, national director of the St. Louis-based Survivors
Network of Those Abused by Priests, said the compromise was
unsatisfactory. "The bishops' take on zero tolerance seems to be
'kinda, sorta, maybe, sometimes--but only in the future,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles said he has already
implemented a zero-tolerance policy that covers the past, present and
future. "'Zero tolerance' means zero tolerance," Mahony said in an
interview..</TE>
<TE>   The president of a conservative Catholic group criticized the
exception to zero tolerance. "You can excuse one sexual assault on a
child? Maybe they are thinking about some bishops out there," said
Stephen Brady, president of the Petersburg, Ill.-based Roman Catholic
Faithful, an orthodox movement within the church with more than 4,500
members.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn defended the proposal's voluntary nature when it comes to
compliance by local bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he found it inconceivable that a bishop would refuse to
put the plan into effect. "Public disclosure will be sanction
enough," Flynn said in response to a question. "I can't imagine a
bishop who would subject himself to that."</TE>

<HD>Filling the Need for Speed</HD>
<DH>A new breed of bikers is tearing up the roads on machines
that easily top 100 mph--and leave police in their dust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Kelly thunders from one freeway to another on his racing
motorcycle, splitting lanes and dodging traffic on his way to work.
No, he's not running late--he's trying to beat his best time.</LD>
<LD>   On weekends, he really gets wild. Pitching and rolling through the
curvy roads of the Santa Monica Mountains, he feels as if he's taking
flight.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly has been banged up and bruised, tossed over his handlebars,
and left unconscious at the bottom of a ravine. But even his worst
brush with death hasn't slowed him down.</LD>
<TE>   "At 120 mph, that's when everything comes alive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From the bluffs of Mulholland Drive to the canyons of Orange
County and San Diego, sport bikers are shaking up the Southern
California motorcycle scene, injecting an element of high-speed
thrill-seeking that has led to conflict with police, motorists and an
older, more laid-back generation of bikers.</TE>
<TE>   They ride a new breed of lightweight, super-fast motorcycles and
sport flashy leather jumpsuits that give them the look of futuristic
comic book heroes. The daredevils among them play chicken with slower
traffic, perform circus-like stunts and often leave motorcycle cops
eating their dust.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the biking world was dominated by the Harley-Davidson
crowd, most of them older riders who prize the freedom and
camaraderie of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the younger bikers are in it for something else--the speed
and sense of danger. Motorists complain about being run off the road
by their risky stunts. Police admit they are outmatched by the
powerful machines.</TE>
<TE>   "Those bikes are incredibly fast. They're difficult to chase,"
said California Highway Patrol Officer Steve Miles, who patrols the
Ortega Highway in Orange County, a favorite biker route. "Usually
they try to outrun us. They know they can."</TE>
<TE>   Today's sport motorcycles are half as heavy and nearly twice as
fast as those produced a decade ago. Frames are made of aluminum and
plastic rather than steel.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest change is in the engines. Many bikes can reach
nearly 200 mph, and some are faster out of the box than a NASCAR race
car.</TE>
<TE>   A standard motorcycle license is all that is needed to ride them.
And with many of the bikes selling for less than $10,000--half the
price of Harleys--they appeal to riders of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of sport bikes in California have doubled in the last few
years, according to industry estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The view among many speed riders is that you haven't lived until
you've survived a spectacular crash. Some carry two-way radios to
alert one another to police patrols, and cell phones so they can
summon friends to help them if they wipe out. "Ambulance rides are
really expensive," said Dave Vernick, 32, a sport biker from San
Diego. "And if the cops come, they give you tickets for crashing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has half a dozen sport bikes in the garage of his Culver
City home. Splashed with reds, greens, yellows and other bright
colors, Kelly's collection, worth about $35,000, includes many of the
models that have become the thrill toys of choice for younger riders.</TE>
<TE>   "Death with keys," Kelly calls them.</TE>
<TE>   He's been a motorcycle fanatic since he was a kid, when he swapped
his BB gun and $30 for his first bike, a red Honda cruiser. He
graduated to faster, more nimble machines as they hit the showrooms.
Now, he says, he's addicted to the adrenaline rush. When he's not
racing through town, he's on a racetrack trying to boost his speed.</TE>
<TE>   Like many in his crowd, Kelly, 32, leads a surprisingly
conventional life when not in the saddle. He owns a home and works
for a Pasadena engineering company.</TE>
<TE>   But on these bikes, even the most conservative riders can't make
any promises. "As soon as you twist the throttle," Kelly said, "it's
like putting drugs in your veins."</TE>
<TE>   He clocks his commute to work and is constantly trying to improve
his time. A speeding ticket last year slowed him down for a little
while. But soon he was at it again.</TE>
<TE>   On a whim, he went to a Ducati motorcycle dealership during a
lunch break to test-drive a new Italian model.</TE>
<TE>   He and a salesman were blazing on separate bikes at 100 mph when
they blew past a cop. They raced back to the dealership, changed out
of their leathers and dashed inside. By the time the police cruiser
pulled up, they were sitting at the salesman's desk as if they had
been innocently discussing business all along.</TE>
<TE>   For Kelly and other rocket riders, the real fun begins on
weekends. That's when they hit the scenic hillsides to test their
skills on two-lane roads that dip, dive and roll. A favorite
destination for Kelly and his biking buddies is the Santa Monica
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   For protection, they wear thick, skintight leather jumpsuits and
aerodynamic helmets.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's shiny outfit, speckled with white, black and chrome, cost
him $1,500 and is considered top of the line. Under this shell are
layers of Kevlar, plastic and high-density foam at the knees, elbows
and other vulnerable spots.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly knows he can look silly in this skin, but it has saved his
life. His closest call was two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   He was riding his Ducati alone through the Santa Monicas and took
his eye off the road for a split second to watch the speedometer
needle cross the 120-mph mark. When he looked up, the road was
turning left. And he didn't have time to turn. He squeezed the front
brakes hard and was thrown headfirst over his handlebars. His midair
thoughts were on his bike and how much it was going to cost to fix
it.</TE>
<TE>   Then the 300-pound machine--and reality--caught up to him.</TE>
<TE>   "My bike hit me in the back," Kelly said. "Then I pretty much
blacked out."</TE>
<TE>   When he regained consciousness, he saw the outline of four bikers
who had seen the crash and came to help him.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly pushed his banged-up bike up a hill to the road and climbed
on board. With all the machismo of Mel Gibson's "Mad Max" character,
he then rode six miles to the nearest coffee shop with crushed ribs
and a punctured lung.</TE>
<TE>   He checked himself into a hospital, where doctors had to perform
emergency surgery for a collapsed lung. Three weeks later, he began
riding his motorcycle again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite his antics, Kelly is on the conservative side of the
speed-biking world. The real daredevils perform wild stunts on rural
back roads, deserted city streets, parking lots, even cemeteries.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Vernick, who loves canyon racing and stunt-riding, says
walking away from a spectacular crash without serious wounds is like
riding all the attractions at Disneyland in a 10-second span.</TE>
<TE>   He should know. He has crashed every bike he ever owned.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to be afraid of doing anything because it's
dangerous and you might die, you might as well be dead," Vernick
said. "You're wasting your life."</TE>
<TE>   Vernick moved to San Diego about three years ago, abandoning the
family construction business in Port Jefferson, N.Y., so he could
ride year-round.</TE>
<TE>   He landed a job in San Diego selling motorcycles and Jet Skis. He
now manages a physical therapy office.</TE>
<TE>   Vernick and his friends often videotape their stunts, trying to
earn a starring role on videos such as "Urban Assault" and "Moving
Violations," which chronicle the adventures of speed riders.</TE>
<TE>   Among his favorite stunts are "stoppies" or "endos," in which
riders go as fast as they can, hit the brakes and pitch forward on
the front wheel until they find a balancing point.</TE>
<TE>   "Wheelies," in which you ride with the front wheel in the air, can
be performed standing up, sitting on the gas tank, with both legs
stretched over the front wheel, or standing with one leg on the seat.
Some riders even do headstands.</TE>
<TE>   Vernick and his friends like to race up and down Palomar Mountain
east of San Diego on the weekends, taking breaks at Mother's Cafe, a
mountaintop hangout where hundreds of sport bikers show up by
breakfast time.</TE>
<TE>   One of Vernick's favorite tales of misadventure involves a
round-trip journey to San Francisco with a few friends two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   On the way, the group was riding about 150 mph on Interstate 5. A
Highway Patrol officer trailed them for miles before he caught up to
them near a construction zone. They talked their way out of tickets
by promising to stay under the 70-mph speed limit. The cop warned
them he was going to radio every other officer ahead of him to be on
the lookout.</TE>
<TE>   "So we did 70 mph for about an hour," Vernick recalled. Then they
let loose, capping it off by doing 120-mph wheelies across the San
Francisco Bay Bridge about midnight.</TE>
<TE>   On the way back, they ended up on a portion of California 1
outside San Luis Obispo that was closed for construction. Vernick,
racing ahead of the pack, missed a left turn at 90 mph. He plowed
into a guardrail that saved him from a 100-foot plunge into the
ocean. He was bloodied and dazed. His bike, one week old, was
totaled.</TE>
<TE>   His friends--and a pickup truck he had passed earlier--eventually
caught up to him and took him to a hospital. He checked himself out a
few hours later and immediately assessed the damage to his mangled
bike. He managed a few wheelies in a motel parking lot before putting
the machine in a friend's pickup. A week later, he purchased a new
one.</TE>
<TE>   "When you fall off, you've got to get back on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tales of near-misses and tragic deaths have become common in the
mountains and canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Angeles Crest Highway and Ortega Highway are among the deadliest
roads for motorcyclists in California. In the last six years, 24
bikers have died on Angeles Crest--three-quarters of them in
single-vehicle accidents in which they lost control. Sixteen
motorcyclists died on the Ortega during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the daredevil tactics of speed racers are one reason
motorcycle fatalities are rising nationally after declining for much
of the '90s. Motorcycle deaths dropped from 3,128 in 1990 to 2,056 in
1997, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. But in
the last three years, the number has risen, reaching 2,793 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Bennett regularly runs into racers on the Ortega Highway, a
narrow, two-lane road through Cleveland National Forest that connects
San Juan Capistrano and Lake Elsinore.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett, 70, has lived along the highway for years but says the
last few have been the worst. The riders hang on the back bumper of
his motor home, and then pass him in a blur.</TE>
<TE>   "It scares the hell out of you," Bennett said. "These guys come
whipping around you. They'll usually take you on an inside curve or
outside curve that they can't see around. They're obscene. They're
obnoxious. And they ought to be horsewhipped."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Gee, a 31-year-old physical therapist from San Diego, was
driving his pickup along the Ortega Highway with his buddies on the
way to a mountain bike excursion when he had to swerve to avoid a
head-on crash with a rider who had crossed the median.</TE>
<TE>   "He got over just in time," Gee said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Miles, the highway patrolman, has policed the Ortega Highway
for 13 years and shares Gee's frustration. At the beginning of each
shift, he drives by those little white crosses that pay tribute to
people who lost their lives on the road, a growing number of them
bikers.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP began a crackdown after one officer was beaten up last
year just outside San Juan Capistrano by two speed bikers he had
pulled over for speeding. But Miles acknowledges that more patrols
and stiffer speeding fines have done little to slow down the new
breed of bikers.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, Miles got into a pursuit through the canyon, with
speeds topping 100 mph. On a curve, he lost control of his cruiser,
which flipped over. He escaped with minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, he thinks twice before trying to catch sport bikers.
"There's situations where I have to stop. It's too reckless," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers who patrol another playground for speed racers--the
twisting Angeles Crest Highway above Los Angeles--have also cracked
down but with more success. The effort involved more officers as well
as road improvements, including repaving and widening the shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   The state increased patrols along the two-lane road, assigning at
least nine units on summer weekends and using a helicopter to monitor
activities from above.</TE>
<TE>   In the two years before the project began, there were 24
fatalities along the 40-mile road, most of them motorcyclists, said
CHP Officer Vincent Bell. In the two years since--during which 500
tickets were written--there have been five deaths.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stunts and aggressive riding are especially aggravating to
Harley loyalists, many of whom are drawn to the open road less for a
speed fix than for the fellowship and feeling of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Bike gangs such as the Hells Angels make up a small portion of the
Harley crowd, and garner headlines for drug dealing and other crimes.
But most of the Harley crowd are weekend warriors who enjoy a morning
of leisurely cruising on their hogs.</TE>
<TE>   Joe "Ol Jug" Pultorak, 81, a World War II fighter pilot and Harley
loyalist, remembers when Harley riders had the highways, hillsides
and hangouts to themselves. They have watched the scene change from
the seats of their Harleys. First came the wealthy, corporate types
who ride their hogs and wear their designer leather on weekends. More
recently, they've noticed the rising tide of sport bikers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole different world now. Everything has changed,"
laments Dusty Switzer, 57, a member of Pultorak's group of aging
Harley loyalists. "It's a little unreal when you used to see two or
three sport bikes, and now you see 103."</TE>
<TE>   An afternoon at the Rock Store restaurant along Mulholland Highway
provides a snapshot of this invasion.</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, Harley riders pull up to the biker hangout, tattoos
and all, on vintage choppers like those seen in the film "Easy
Rider." Sport bikers zip in and out in equal numbers, swapping tales
of derring-do. By the time the place fills up, it looks like a bunch
of superheroes got lost on their way to a cartoon convention and
somehow ended up at a casting call for a remake of "The Wild Ones."</TE>
<TE>   Following an unwritten rule, Harley riders and sport bikers park
on separate sides of the parking lot. When their paths cross on the
road, things can get ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Botswaner of Westchester recalled approaching a traffic light
next to a group of Harley riders who greeted him with an obscene
gesture. He waited for the light to turn green, then let out the
throttle and aimed for the convoy. He swerved at the last instant to
avoid contact, then sped away.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Rock Store, 34-year-old Duke Maltin has his own stories
about encounters with Harley riders, which he recounts between bites
of scrambled eggs and glimpses of a motorcycle race being broadcast
on a big-screen television.</TE>
<TE>   Maltin said he and a friend were speeding up Mulholland when they
came upon a Harley pack out for a ride last year. Instead of waiting
for a safe chance to pass on the left, his riding partner weaved
through the formation.</TE>
<TE>   "He was cutting these Harley guys up like Swiss cheese. He didn't
care," Maltin said.</TE>
<TE>   The Harley pack tracked down Maltin and his friend and started
beating up the friend. Maltin begged them to stop, explaining that
his friend was new to the sport and didn't know the rules of the
road.</TE>
<TE>   With his red jumpsuit peeled to his waist to expose a "Speed
Racer" T-shirt, Maltin personifies the new generation of speed biker.
A computer consultant and struggling actor, he is obsessed with
speed. Harleys are like any other "slowpoke" getting in his way.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a thrill-seeker," he says with a devilish grin, before taking
off on his Suzuki 600. "I'm out here to risk it all."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse released its recommendations
Tuesday on how Roman Catholic bishops in the United States should
respond to the clerical sexual abuse crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Recommendations for the bishops:</LD>
<LD>   * Report all abuse allegations to civil authorities.</LD>
<TE>   "Dioceses will report any accusation of sexual abuse of a person
who is a minor to the proper authorities and cooperate in their
investigation. Diocese will cooperate with proper authorities about
reporting when the person is no longer a minor. In every instance,
diocese will advise and support a person's right to make a report to
proper authorities."</TE>
<TE>   * Remove all priests who abused more than one child in the past
and those who abuse any child in the future.</TE>
<TE>   * Have each diocese create a review board, composed mainly of
laypeople, to examine abuse claims. The review board's functions
would include determining whether a priest who molested one child in
the past can continue to serve under supervision and other
conditions, such as continuing counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "Where the allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a cleric is
admitted or otherwise determined, the following will pertain:</TE>
<TE>   " ... Regarding acts of sexual abuse committed subsequent to this
date, the diocesan policy will provide that, effective immediately,
even a single act of abuse of a minor will bring about a request for
laicization [removal from priesthood], even without the consent of
the cleric.</TE>
<TE>   "Regarding acts of sexual abuse of a minor committed prior to this
date, if the cleric is a pedophile, or if he has committed more than
one act of sexual abuse of a minor, there will be a request for the
cleric's laicization even without his consent if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   " ... Regarding clerics with past offenses who have been treated,
not diagnosed as pedophiles, and who have not committed more than one
act of sexual abuse of a minor, their ministerial status must be
considered by the [lay] diocesan review board. In every instance the
victim of the abuse will be offered the opportunity to contribute to
the evaluation and recommendation. A similar opportunity will be
offered to the offender. Any subsequent ministerial assignment must
be accompanied by disclosure of the cleric's situation to those with
whom he will live and serve. For the sake of due process, an accused
is to be encouraged to retain the assistance of civil and canonical
counsel."</TE>
<TE>   * Bishops should no longer enter into confidentiality agreements
in settlements of civil lawsuits over sex abuse unless the victim
insists.</TE>
<TE>   * Require background checks for diocesan and parish workers who
have contact with children.</TE>
<TE>   * Have bishops provide an "accurate and complete" description of a
priest's personnel record if the cleric seeks to transfer to another
diocese.</TE>
<TE>   * Have dioceses establish an outreach program to support victims
of priestly sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   * Create a commission to research how the U.S. church has
responded to sexual abuse by priests and join other denominations and
organizations in researching child sexual abuse in society at large.</TE>
<TE>   * Create a national Office of Child and Youth Protection in the
United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to implement "safe
environment" programs to protect children from abuse.</TE>
<TE>   * Create a review board, including parents, to work with the Child
Protection Office to annually examine how the bishops are responding
to abuse.</TE>

<HD>THE SECESSION DEBATE</HD>

<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of a vote likely to put Hollywood secession on the
November ballot, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn joined about 50
anti-secessionists in the heart of Hollywood to argue against it.</LD>
<LD>   "Los Angeles wouldn't be a great city without Hollywood in it,"
the mayor said at a midmorning rally staged at the MTA Red Line
station at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street by a group calling
itself HALO--Hollywood and Los Angeles as One.</LD>
<LD>   "Secession," Hahn said, "isn't the answer."</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra quietly waited for the
rally to end so he could make his case to reporters. Group officials
said they held the event before today's scheduled vote by the Local
Agency Formation Commission of Los Angeles County to show there is
opposition in Hollywood to breaking away from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The panel, which sets the terms and conditions for forming new
cities, has already decided to put the San Fernando Valley secession
measure on the Nov. 5 general election ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, panel Executive Director Larry Calemine released a
report Tuesday showing that the cumulative financial impact of the
Valley and Hollywood breaking from Los Angeles would probably be more
positive than negative for the new municipalities and the city they
would leave behind.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hollywood rally, Hahn urged the commission to decide
against putting the Hollywood measure on the citywide ballot, noting
that recent economic studies by Los Angeles officials and state
Controller Kathleen Connell said Hollywood would not be a viable
city.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn argued that support for secession in Hollywood isn't
widespread, noting that a recent survey by the Hollywood Chamber of
Commerce showed that chamber members were opposed to breaking away
from Los Angeles by a 2-1 ratio.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession is "half-baked," Hahn said. "We don't want to
be part of it."</TE>
<TE>   One of the speakers at the rally, Los Feliz resident Christi Van
Cleve, said Los Angeles officials were working hard to provide
services to overcome problems in hard-luck neighborhoods, where
secession might seem appealing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [La Pietra's] solution is the answer," Van Cleve
said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to carrying placards that read "I Love L.A." and
"Divorce Might Work for People but [Is] Bad for Cities," secession
opponents circulated papers asking the panel to exclude Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles and residential areas covered by the Los Feliz
Improvement Assn., the Franklin Hills Resident Assn., the Melrose
Hill Neighborhood Assn. and the East Hollywood Community Assn. from
the proposed new city of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   When the rally ended, reporters sought out La Pietra. He accused
Hahn and other anti-secessionists of trying to scare voters with dire
predictions of financial doom. "There's nothing to be afraid of," La
Pietra said. "One great city will soon become three great
cities--Hollywood, Camelot [a proposed name for the Valley] and Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   For example, contracting police services from the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department would save the new Hollywood $9 million a
year, La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed suggestions that the new city would replace the Los
Angeles Fire Department. "It's a great fire department and it will
stay in Hollywood," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the new Hollywood would continue to enforce rent control,
which the Los Angeles City Council enacted citywide in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   "Seventy-two percent of Hollywood residents are renters," he said.
"The power is with the renters, not with Gene La Pietra."</TE>
<TE>   Calemine's report was in response to concerns by Los Angeles
County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski that the financial harm caused by two cities breaking
away could be cumulatively greater than each analyzed separately.</TE>
<TE>   "In a rational world, the city of Los Angeles will 'right-size'
and reorganize in the long term to effectively and efficiently
deliver services to [its] smaller constituent base," Calemine said in
the report.</TE>
<TE>   He said research in the field of urban management indicates that
some services, including police and fire, are provided at a higher
cost per capita in large cities than in smaller municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Calamine said, it would be less expensive to
contract with the Sheriff's Department instead of using the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Other services, including sewage treatment, water and electric
service, benefit by the economies of scale in larger cities, Calemine
found. He noted that sewage treatment and utility services would
continue to be provided to the new cities by Los Angeles under the
breakup scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine's findings were dismissed by Los Angeles Deputy Mayor
Matt Middlebrook, who said they were flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Patrick McGreevy contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Leader of Breakaway Bid Has a Hollywood Flair</HD>
<DH>Politics: Gay nightclub owner Gene La Pietra brings his own
style to secession effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gene La Pietra sits in a back corner booth at Musso &amp; Frank, telling
the story of his first days in Hollywood, when he begged for nickels
in front of the Hollywood Boulevard restaurant and slept for a month
in a nearby church parking lot, washing his one shirt each night in
the gas-station sink across the street.</LD>
<LD>   At 54, he's now a millionaire, the owner of two of the most
popular gay nightclubs in town. He's also the leader of the Hollywood
secession movement, to which he has contributed "at least half a
million" so far, he says. His dollars and drive pushed the campaign
forward so fast that it was already inches from the ballot before
City Hall and much of Hollywood seemed to notice.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the Local Agency Formation Commission is expected to put
the proposal to break Hollywood off from Los Angeles on the Nov. 5
ballot, alongside the secession bid for the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<TE>   La Pietra's critics say his motives are selfish, that he hopes to
use a new city to make more money at his clubs. He says he wants to
be Hollywood's mayor, so he can fully restore its lost glory.</TE>
<TE>   His own rags-to-riches tale mirrors his plan for a Hollywood city.</TE>
<TE>   Between bites of orange roughy and the media calls that keep his
cell phone constantly dancing on the tablecloth, he leans back in the
red-leather booth and describes how he grew up in a Rhode Island
orphanage and foster homes, and then hitchhiked west, tugged straight
across the country by a celluloid image of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood name still lures people from everywhere, only to
disappoint them when they get here, he says in the slightly twangy,
street-tough Rhode Island accent he's never shed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to bring Hollywood back to the future, to restore it to
the glamour and the grandeur it once had," he said. "Right now,
Hollywood is so far down in the garbage, we can only do better. We
can only see daylight."</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, Hollywood might seem to be on the upswing. The
city has a hot bar and club scene in addition to the new Hollywood &amp;
Highland mall, built for nearly $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But La Pietra and others in his small secessionist group Hollywood
VOTE, which includes his hypnotherapist brother John, say the
district has a long way to go. They point out that stores at
Hollywood &amp; Highland already are closing, and that the city is paying
about $500,000 a month to cover the shortfall at the mall parking
lot, which was built with city funds. They say money would be better
spent on sprucing up Hollywood Boulevard around the mall and on
fighting the drug dealing on the surrounding streets.</TE>
<TE>   Driving east on Hollywood Boulevard after leaving Musso &amp; Frank,
La Pietra can't stop fuming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rough neighborhood here," he says. "It gets pretty scary.
And there's so much denial at City Hall about the crime and the
gangsterism, which goes all the way from here to Melrose [Avenue].
Any idiot can see it's grown. Some people have made gallant efforts
to turn things around. But they need an engaged government. They
can't do it alone."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra recently hired a public relations representative, who
sits by his side at LAFCO meetings. But Hollywood secession hardly
needs professional help to attract attention.</TE>
<TE>   For months now, La Pietra has been fielding calls from the likes
of the Times of London and Tokyo TV. As a news story, Hollywood has
more sex appeal than the San Fernando Valley. So does the Hollywood
movement's leader, a very different breed of secessionist from the
conservative real estate types running the Valley breakaway movement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not as angry. I'm pretty happy," he said, laughing, while
noting that the Hollywood and Valley campaigns are united. In fact,
he says, he got the idea for Hollywood secession from a news article
about Valley secessionist Jeff Brain, "who made it all sound so
easy."</TE>
<TE>   But the differences between La Pietra and other secession leaders
run deep.</TE>
<TE>   He is a liberal Democrat and a longtime major donor to Gov. Gray
Davis, who appointed him to the state Parks Commission.</TE>
<TE>   He is openly gay, and open, too, about the fact that in the early
1970s, he was convicted of state and federal obscenity charges for
selling sexually explicit movies and books.</TE>
<TE>   His partner, Alejandro Lopez, 28, is a popular mariachi singer at
the clubs. The two men drive silver and gold Lexus sedans. They
divide their time between an almost entirely unfurnished,
10,000-square-foot white mansion on Los Feliz Boulevard--complete
with pool, tennis court and topiaries shaped into dogs and a teddy
bear--and a cozy bungalow on Fountain Avenue in Hollywood, where La
Pietra fashioned the beige marble bathroom to look like the ones at
Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Feliz house lies just outside the proposed Hollywood
boundaries. La Pietra says he uses it mostly for fund-raising, and
quips that it will be Hollywood's Los Angeles embassy after
secession.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra's brash ways rile some people. Former employees say he
really wants to take control of Hollywood so he can keep his clubs
open all night. John Walsh, a transit advocate who lives in
Hollywood, says La Pietra wants to make Hollywood "pornopolis."</TE>
<TE>   "Gene is a promoter and I feel he's very typical of all
promoters," said Chris Schabel, a longtime Hollywood activist who was
upset when La Pietra got city permission to close part of Hollywood
Boulevard for his annual New Year's party, which raises money for
youth programs.</TE>
<TE>   But La Pietra also inspires fierce loyalty among those who are
moved by his longtime community activism and philanthropy.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the proof has been in what he's contributed. And from the
perspective of the gay community or AIDS, there's been no better
friend," said Michael Weinstein, head of the AIDS Healthcare
Foundation, who has known La Pietra since 1987, when the nightclub
owner donated $200,000 to an AIDS hospice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's passionate, he's smart, he's compassionate and he's
generous--to the tune of I don't know exactly how much but easily
into the seven figures," Weinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Miki Jackson, who runs Aunt Bee's, a nonprofit organization that
benefits people with AIDS, described La Pietra as an iconoclast.</TE>
<TE>   "He's his own man. Nobody tells him what to do or think. He
doesn't care what the fashionable thing to do is. He just does what
he thinks should be done," she said.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra's clubs, Arena and Circus Disco on Santa Monica
Boulevard, regularly draw long lines, especially for Boys Night Out,
a Tuesday tradition at Circus since the 1970s. Arena has a gilded DJ
booth that La Pietra designed, and a balcony with private cabanas
hung with leopard-print curtains. At Circus, silver disco balls hang
over an enormous wooden dance floor, kept gleaming by La Pietra's 166
employees.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, La Pietra, who says he was "pretty much all
schooled out by the eighth grade" (and admits that he paid a teacher
$300 to get a high school diploma), has become fluent in the dense
jargon of LAFCO, with its comprehensive fiscal analyses, mitigation
payments and intangible assets.</TE>
<TE>   He's equally fluent in the businesses he runs, where he proudly
shows off the immaculate, graffiti-free restrooms and talks about the
different crowds that fill the clubs on different nights--"gay Latino
over here, black lesbians over there."</TE>
<TE>   He is a short man, who rocks a little when he walks. He has a
politician's toothy grin and a corporate look--navy blue suit, crisp
blue oxford shirt, maroon tie.</TE>
<TE>   But he is anything but conventional.</TE>
<TE>   He naps every day from around 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Then he stays up at
his clubs until around 4 a.m. He's up again at 7:30 a.m. to start his
day.</TE>
<TE>   But even though he spends his nights under disco balls and laser
lights, he doesn't drink or smoke. He says grace before meals. He
coos over his pets, especially his five cats. He says the "Chicken
Soup for the Soul" books make him cry. He says Andrew Carnegie should
be on Mt. Rushmore "because he gave everything away."</TE>
<TE>   On the path from Hollywood homelessness to wealth, La Pietra did a
number of things ordinary and less so. He served in the Coast Guard.
He worked in an insurance company mailroom. He sold adult materials
in Hawaiian Gardens and Bell Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   His arrests became a major campaign issue in 1986, when he spent
more than $334,000 to run for the West Hollywood City Council.</TE>
<TE>   But La Pietra said he never served time, and that getting arrested
made him an activist.</TE>
<TE>   Talking about what's wrong with Hollywood and how to fix it, he
gets in his car and gives a tour. On Hollywood Boulevard, he points
out a drug dealer working in plain sight in front of the Roosevelt
Hotel. Driving east, he passes a theater whose facade is grimly
boarded up with plywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at that. That should be allowed?" he asks. "Before the
Pacific Theater gets a license in the new Hollywood, they're going to
have to fix that."</TE>
<TE>   On Van Ness Street, south of Hollywood Boulevard, he points out
"Couch City," an area where furniture sits abandoned on the street
for months. In his city, he'd have a truck come around every day, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Quality of life is the last thing they're going to enforce. God
bless 'em, they're going after the murderers," he says of the Los
Angeles police. "But it's quality-of-life issues that will destroy a
neighborhood overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "You and I together could go out and pick up those couches," he
says, then laughs. "Well, you could pick 'em up. I could drive."</TE>
<TE>   He says Los Angeles is so big that it no longer knows how to solve
small problems.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. always has to apply everything in a big way. It's time to
think small," he says.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra's version of small isn't everyone's. He's working on a
plan to renovate a park in Hollywood and turn it into "Centre of the
Universe," a free, 24-hour youth center, where kids would be fed, get
health care, play sports of all sorts, and learn cutting-edge skills
at film and culinary schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you believe it?" he says, showing off a brochure for the
park, with a drawing of a "Jetsons"-like campus.</TE>
<TE>   When he gets enthusiastic, he can't stop. He's prone to comparing
himself to George Washington, who he says paid his soldiers out of
his own pocket when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "George Washington put his money where his mouth was.... You've
got to," he said. "It does no good to go and complain unless you're
willing to do the work, unless you're fully committed."</TE>
<TE>   He also says he's been checking out the first president's
playbook.</TE>
<TE>   "I go on the Web site there--the George Washington one--and I read
how he did it. And that's the strategy we used here. It was a very
stealth strategy. He didn't engage the enemy on every hill. But he
stayed strong, and in the end he won."</TE>

<HD>Police May Have Missed Boy's Body</HD>
<DH>Westside: Child, 7, who disappeared Sunday, is found in
pool that was checked earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anguished Los Angeles Police Department detectives said Tuesday they
may have failed to notice a 7-year-old boy who was lying dead for two
days in a swimming pool in Holmby Hills, after saying only hours
earlier that someone must have dumped the body there overnight.</LD>
<LD>   The case of Paolo Alexander Ayala, who disappeared Sunday after an
afternoon pool party, could be a sloppy police investigation of a
drowning or a mysterious killing in one of Los Angeles' most affluent
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Hours after Paolo's body was spotted by a housekeeper Tuesday
morning, face-up on the bottom, police were leaning toward the
simpler explanation. A preliminary coroner's examination showed
"signs of drowning," said LAPD Deputy Chief David Kalish.</LD>
<TE>   The boy was wearing the same blue-and-white swim trunks he wore at
the party and showed no obvious signs of trauma, he said. An autopsy
is expected today.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we determine the child was in the pool the entire
time... no one should feel guilty. There is nothing anyone could have
done," Kalish said. "Maybe everyone missed him."</TE>
<TE>   Kalish backed away from his earlier declaration that "there is no
way that boy's body was there yesterday." He conceded that an
extensive police search may have overlooked the child.</TE>
<TE>   Officers checked the pool but never physically swept it, he said,
even though the boy was last seen alive in the shallow end with other
youngsters. The pool is 35 feet long, 20 feet wide and 9 feet deep at
one end, police said. It has a light-colored bottom.</TE>
<TE>   One detective who took part in Monday's all-day search, Lt. Michelle
Veenstra, said she is certain she checked the pool but saw no evidence of
the child.  The water, she said, was clear.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan said a number of people had looked in the
pool on Sunday, as well as during an extensive search for the missing
boy Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "There were dozens of people around, all of whom looked in the
pool and came to the same conclusion," he said: that the pool was
empty. "Several officers also made a statement that they looked in
the pool and believed he was not in there."</TE>
<TE>   According to officers on the scene, Brennan said, "It was either the
most convincing optical illusion ever, or that body was not in that pool."</TE>
<TE>   Paolo Ayala could not swim, said his uncle, Daniel Salazar.
The boy was one of three children of Franklin and Edwina Ayala, who live
in a one-bedroom apartment on Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills,
seemingly a world apart from the posh estates of Holmby Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The father, a maintenance man, and mother, who house-sits and
cares for children, "live from paycheck to paycheck" supporting a
12-year-old son and 10-month-old baby, a family friend said.</TE>
<TE>   Paolo had never been to a mansion until he attended Sunday's
birthday party for Alex Farkhondehpour, a classmate at El Rodeo
Elementary School. Alex's parents, Saeed and Kimberly Farkhondehpour,
own the eight-bedroom home where the party was held, about a block
from Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Zakariaie, an attorney for the Farkhondehpour family,
described them as distressed about the incident and said, "They
absolutely had nothing to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Paolo's family was shown a photograph of him Tuesday with blood
visible around his nose, according to the boy's uncle. They seemed to
immediately go into shock, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to speak to anyone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though emphasizing that it is still unclear how the boy died or
came to be in the pool, Brennan said it is not unknown for drowning
victims' bodies to escape detection at first. For reasons that are
not clear, there have been cases in recent years in which a person
has drowned in a swimming pool, but an initial search found no body,
he said. In such cases, he said, the body turns up in the pool hours
later.</TE>
<TE>   There was such a case in 1997 in Santa Ana, and another in 1999 in
Modesto. In the Modesto case, the death of a 4-year-old girl was
investigated as a homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the boy's body was discovered about 8:30 a.m.
Tuesday, Kalish seemed to leave no doubt that somebody had dumped the
child in the pool after investigators had left the area.</TE>
<TE>   Noting the clarity of the water, the deputy chief said, "There's
no way that body could have been in the pool when we left at 10 last
night. There's no way he could have been missed.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears at this time someone placed the body in the pool early
this morning or late last night," Kalish said.</TE>
<TE>   After the initial evidence of drowning, Kalish retreated from
those comments, but police continue to investigate the possibility of
foul play. Detectives obtained search warrants Tuesday afternoon and
used "cadaver dogs" to search the home in the 10300 block of Wyton
Drive for evidence that the body had been moved, said Sgt. John
Pasquariello.</TE>
<TE>   The search ended at 5 p.m., but police would not reveal what they
found.</TE>
<TE>   During today's autopsy, coroner's investigators will try to
determine whether the boy drowned. His body temperature and the time
of his disappearance will provide clues, said Craig Harvey, the
county coroner's operations chief.</TE>
<TE>   Pathologists will also look for pool chlorine in the lungs and the
presence of the foamy mucus that often results from choking. They
will examine the boy's stomach for evidence of food served at the
party, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Bassler, a retired pathologist and former deputy
medical examiner for Los Angeles County in the 1960s, said tests also
consider whether stabbing, shooting, suffocation or strangulation
might have caused the death.</TE>
<TE>   A body lying in a pool for two days would show "a good
dishpan-hand effect" on the tissues, he said. A body dumped more
recently would not.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy also might show signs of a struggle, Bassler said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surprising how easy it is to tell," he said, "because even a
small child would show signs, like a broken fingernail, something
under the fingernail. You become very strong if you're fighting for
your life."</TE>
<TE>   Bassler recalled "a lot of cases where bodies were in the pool and
no one can see them. You can stand and look in it and you think
you're looking at the bottom, but what you're looking at is dirty
water at the bottom. If he was down at the bottom all this time, the
water would have to have that optical illusion."</TE>
<TE>   Photographs from the party showed the pool looked "murky," said
Kalish, but a pool cleaner visited the home Monday and used chemicals
to clean it. The pool cleaner did not sweep the pool, however, the
deputy chief said.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD set up a command post Monday at a nearby country club as
part of its effort to locate the missing boy. About 50 officers
participated in the search with help from Beverly Hills police.</TE>
<TE>   Bloodhounds tracked the boy's scent to a nearby park, but
investigators later learned that he visited the park before the
party. Neighbors and parent volunteers from his elementary school
also searched the area.</TE>
<TE>   The housekeeper noticed the boy's body Tuesday and screamed for
help. Residents immediately called 911, Kalish said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they were shocked by suspicions that the child may
have been killed. "This is one of the safest places to live," said
Nor Ghodsian, 48, who lives five houses away. "That's why I pay $1
million-and-a-half to live here."</TE>
<TE>   Ghodsian said she walks the neighborhood about 10 p.m. most
nights, but didn't Monday. On Tuesday, members of the El Rancho PTA
announced a fund to assist the Ayala family. Contributions to the
Paolo Ayala Memorial Fund can be made at City National Bank, 400 N.
Roxbury Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90210.</TE>

five of 17 corruption charges but left intact more serious
allegations that he headed a criminal empire run out of City Hall.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Ernest Torres, ruling in mid-trial, said
prosecutors failed to prove Cianci extorted bribes from tow truck
operators or urged a witness to lie to the FBI. Cianci still faces
some key charges, including two counts of racketeering.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also acquitted former top mayoral aide Frank Corrente of
taking bribes and urging an official to lie to the FBI. Edward
Voccola, a convicted felon and businessman, had both federal
racketeering charges against him dismissed.</TE>

<HD>Attack May Be Tied to Autopsy, Police Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Tenn. medical examiner's finding in killing of
police officer has stirred controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>O.C. Smith, the medical examiner in Memphis, Tenn., is known for his
contentious findings. Some of his colleagues in the no-nonsense world
of forensic pathology have even said that "he reaches."</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, investigators said that one of Smith's autopsies
likely was behind an attack that left the 49-year-old pathologist
hogtied outside his office last weekend with a bomb ticking on his
chest.</LD>
<LD>   "He's worked some pretty controversial cases that made people
upset," Memphis police inspector Matt McCann said. "That's who
probably did this."</LD>
<TE>   Police rescued Smith before the bomb went off, and the wiry doctor
was back at work the next day. He's declined interviews, saying he is
concerned about his safety.</TE>
<TE>   To fellow medical examiners, the circumstances of the attack are
weird--but the fact that a forensic pathologist was targeted is not.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten stalked and threatened countless times," said Stanton
Kessler, formerly Boston's chief medical examiner. "That's what you
get in this job. You deal with nuts."</TE>
<TE>   Often, a medical examiner's analysis of a mysterious death or
grisly crime scene can spell the difference between guilt and
innocence in a murder trial.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis investigators believe that a man enraged about Smith's
role in a cop-killer case ambushed him around 10 p.m. Saturday as he
was leaving his office, the Shelby County Regional Forensic Center.</TE>
<TE>   He told police that the attacker splashed fluid in his face,
slugged him to the ground, tied him up with barbed wire and attached
a small explosive device to his chest. Police wouldn't say what kind
of bomb it was.</TE>
<TE>   "But it was live," McCann said. "It could have killed him."</TE>
<TE>   Smith could not identify the attacker. But police think it was the
same person who wrote a threatening letter last year calling Smith a
"killer" and a "soulless demon." The author accused Smith of lying in
his testimony regarding Philip Workman, who now is on death row.</TE>
<TE>   Workman was convicted of killing a police officer and wounding
another during an armed robbery at a Wendy's restaurant in 1981. The
bullet that killed Lt. Ronald Oliver was never found, and Workman
always has insisted that it was another cop who shot Oliver in a
friendly-fire exchange.</TE>
<TE>   His case has become a cause celebre among death penalty critics.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when Workman came up for a clemency hearing, Smith used
electron microscopy--which can magnify an object up to 10 million
times--to determine that there were flecks of aluminum in the
officer's tissue samples, implicating Workman as the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   The gun Workman had on the night of the robbery was loaded with
aluminum-jacketed bullets.</TE>
<TE>   But two pathologists have cast doubt on Smith's findings.</TE>
<TE>   Cyril Wecht, Pittsburgh's chief medical examiner and president of
the American Board of Legal Medicine, said: "Nobody in forensics has
used electron microscopy before. It wouldn't meet peer review
standards and shouldn't have been accepted."</TE>
<TE>   Werner U. Spitz, author of "Medicolegal Investigation of
Death"--which is considered to be the bible of forensic
pathology--also said there was no scientific basis for Smith's
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, he reaches," Werner said. "And that's wrong. You
can't be an advocate for anyone in this business.</TE>
<TE>   "Your job is to go in there and tell the truth," Werner added.</TE>
<TE>   Both have said they would testify on behalf of Workman, whose case
is under appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In response to questions, a spokeswoman for Smith issued a
statement Tuesday saying: "We feel that it is important that we not
engage in starting a debate of any kind that may inflame the attacker
and have the potential to create an increased safety issue for Dr.
Smith."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler, the former Boston medical examiner, said Smith is very
careful and meticulous.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that he's aggressive and he's a bulldog," Kessler said.
"But I know he really believes in what he does."</TE>

<HD>Gephardt Endorses Ousting Hussein</HD>
<DH>Politics: The House Democratic leader's support of military
force could help Bush get congressional backing if he chooses that
course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), detailing the
foreign policy agenda of a possible presidential campaign, on Tuesday
backed President Bush's call for the ouster of Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein but accused the administration of lacking an "appropriate
sense of urgency" in strengthening homeland defenses.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech here, Gephardt explicitly endorsed the use of military
force to remove Hussein, as the administration has been considering.
"We should use diplomatic tools where we can, but military means when
we must to eliminate the threat he poses to the region and our own
security," Gephardt said.</LD>
<LD>   Gephardt's comments could help Bush build congressional support
for an attack on Iraq if the president chooses that option. Other
Democrats considering a 2004 race--including Sens. Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and John
Edwards of North Carolina--have also said they would support the use
of force against Iraq. Kerry, though, has said he would prefer to
first provide more aid to Hussein's foes within Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Gephardt generally avoided criticizing Bush's initiatives and
performance, but he suggested that the president had allowed an
"undercurrent of unilateralism" to strain our relations with allies
abroad. Gephardt also argued for the creation of a Cabinet agency to
direct homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, Gephardt confined his differences with Bush to arguing
that the administration should push further in directions in which it
is already heading on such matters as modernizing the military and
reforming foreign aid.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to all we are doing now, we will need to do more,"
Gephardt said. "We will need to make our military stronger, our
homeland safer and build alliances abroad to serve American
interests."</TE>
<TE>   The speech's overall tone was more conciliatory toward Bush than
Gephardt's typical comments on economic or social policy. That
continued a pattern in which most leading Democrats have sought to
minimize their arguments with Bush on terrorism-related concerns
while accentuating their differences on domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Since the early 1980s, Gephardt has been considered a leader of
the Democrats' traditional liberal wing, with particularly close ties
to organized labor. But he appears to be moving toward the center as
he considers a run for the White House in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Gephardt delivered a centrist speech on
economic policy to the Democratic Leadership Council, the party's
leading moderate group. And in Tuesday's address, Gephardt struck a
generally hawkish tone, implicitly endorsing Bush's call for a
massive increase in defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt's main argument was that, to safeguard the nation against
terrorism, the United States needs not only to strengthen its
defenses but also to intensify its engagement abroad. He christened
that approach "commitment" and presented it as a successor to the
strategy of "containment" that guided U.S. foreign policy through the
Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   "We must be prepared to deliver the most forceful military
response to provocation but also to expand opportunities for peace
and prosperity," Gephardt said.</TE>
<TE>   He said his policy of "commitment" would have three priorities:</TE>
<TE>   * Modernizing the military. Gephardt urged the appointment of a
bipartisan advisory commission to spur development of technologically
advanced "smart" weapons, like the pilotless Predator drones used in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt also said he would pursue legislation to increase the
size of the nation's 1.4-million member armed forces. And he urged
comprehensive reform of the Pentagon's supply and logistics systems,
which he said is wasting $20 billion to $30 billion annually.</TE>
<TE>   * Encouraging diplomatic engagement abroad. Gephardt broadly
embraced Bush's recent proposal to increase U.S. foreign aid while
tying the assistance to economic and political reform in the
recipient countries--the so-called Millennium Challenge Account. But
he urged Bush to use the initiative to push Arab and Muslim nations
to specifically lower trade barriers, encourage a stronger rule of
law and expand access to public education.</TE>
<TE>   "We should work with developing nations to help them create
universal education systems," Gephardt said, citing recent
legislation that offers U.S. foreign aid to provide meals for
children whose parents allow them to attend school.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt also said the administration should "redouble efforts" to
strengthen America's international alliances.</TE>
<TE>   * Strengthening homeland security. In his sharpest criticism of
Bush, Gephardt said the nation was "moving too slowly to develop a
homeland defense plan that is tough enough for this new war."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is proposing to photograph, fingerprint and
get detailed information from thousands more foreign visitors to the
United States, law enforcement officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, the Justice Department would expand the reach of
an existing law to keep better track of tourists, business travelers,
students and temporary workers considered possible security threats.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department officials declined to comment on the plan,
details of which are expected to be announced this week.</LD>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has undertaken a number of initiatives to
better track foreign visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners seeking to live in the United States are photographed
and fingerprinted and must provide background information to the
government. But the same is not required of most visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft is seeking to expand a 1998 rule that requires visitors
from Libya, Iraq, Sudan and Iran to register with the government. The
rule could be applied to people from as many as 35 countries under
the proposal.</TE>

<HD>Cookout May Have Led to Colorado Fire</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Overturned grill, high winds could explain a blaze
that destroyed 100 homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COTOPAXI, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Investigators are pursuing reports Tuesday that a barbecue grill left
unattended by a group of off-road driving enthusiasts was responsible
for the massive fire that has so far consumed 100 homes and more than
100 other structures.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told authorities that several people were driving
four-wheel-drive vehicles Sunday on private land near subdivisions in
the hilly area near Canon City, about 130 miles southwest of Denver.
The group stopped for a cookout, and investigators believe their
grill was either left behind or the afternoon's high winds blew it
over, spraying white-hot charcoal briquettes into the highly
combustible surrounding forest.</LD>
<LD>   One county official said it appeared that the individuals were not
from the area.</LD>
<TE>   "I just can't believe that somebody would be that irresponsible to
run that barbecue grill," Fremont County Commissioner Jim Schauer
said. "But I can see that happening. You drive down the street and
people throw cigarettes out their car windows. They've done it for
years. Even with this drought, we find people with open fires in
campgrounds."</TE>
<TE>   He said the overturned grill was found by investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-moving blaze scorched 4,400 acres of private and public
land on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. More than 1,400
residents were evacuated. Tuesday's rain and cooler temperatures gave
firefighters the upper hand. Officials estimated the blaze was 85%
contained and would be 100% contained today. By late Tuesday,
sheriff's deputies began escorting residents to the burned-out
subdivisions, where scores of homes were gutted.</TE>
<TE>   With the fire at bay, much of the effort shifted to determining
the cause and finding those responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Baxter, a law enforcement officer with the Forest Service,
was one of four investigators who examined the scene Tuesday. He said
that the movements of residents and volunteer firefighters destroyed
much of the evidence at the fire's origin.</TE>
<TE>   The Iron Mountain fire has been by far the most destructive of
this wildfire season and one of the worst in recent years. The fire
season began months early in March with a blaze near Ruidoso, N.M.,
that destroyed 28 homes.</TE>
<TE>   The drought has transformed forests and grassland into prime
fire-fuel areas. Fire bans, in effect across most of Colorado, appear
to have had only mixed results in preventing open fires in parched
forests.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens declared a fire ban on all
state land. Most of the state's national forests and national parks
have banned open fires for weeks. Some public land, such as Rocky
Mountain National Park, restrict smoking to within vehicles, or
outside only in areas with at least 3 feet of cleared space.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Fremont County, open fires were prohibited April 23.
Schauer said no one has yet been ticketed or fined for fire
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Other counties throughout the state have imposed similar fire
restrictions. Colorado has been declared a federal disaster area
because of the severe drought, the worst in decades.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple fires were burning elsewhere in the West on Tuesday. A
fire along the Colorado-New Mexico border burned 4,800 acres and
destroyed at least one home and forced the evacuation of 11 ranches
and three other homes near Trinidad, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   A separate fire of about 15,000 acres in the same area threatened
three communities and had burned across some methane-gas fields. Fire
information officer Alan Hoffmeister said few homes or people were
threatened.</TE>
<TE>   He said gas wells were shut down and pipelines were drained.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Cotopaxi, evacuees sheltered at the local school peppered
authorities with questions at a spirited town hall meeting Monday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "All you had to do was look at those people," Schauer said. "They
weren't angry. But if the guy who started it was there, he would have
probably been lynched."</TE>
<TE>   Officials would not say whether they have suspects in the case.
But if charges are brought in this fire, the consequences are likely
to be severe.</TE>
<TE>   Three teenagers were charged with felony arson in a fire near
Bailey, Colo., in April that burned 2,300 acres and threatened
hundreds of homes. Authorities say the boys were smoking and their
discarded cigarettes started the blaze, which caused more than $2.6
million in damage.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no damage estimates in the Iron Mountain fire.</TE>
<TE>   "If they find the guy, he will be charged," Schauer said. "He'll
have to pay."</TE>

<HD>Congressional Panel Widens Terror Probe</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: House-Senate committee will look at intelligence
lapses dating to the 1980s. The unsolved anthrax attacks will also be
investigated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A joint congressional panel agreed Tuesday to conduct a surprisingly
broad probe of intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11, even as
President Bush acknowledged past lapses and sought to curb Congress'
appetite for an ever-widening investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the House-Senate panel said they plan to go back 16
years to the days of the Reagan administration in examining what the
U.S. intelligence community knew--or should have known--about
terrorist threats to the United States. And the review will encompass
related areas such as last fall's anthrax attacks along the Eastern
Seaboard, an expansion of the panel's mandate that stirred sharp
debate among lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   The aggressive opening of the intelligence panel's review came as
the finger-pointing within the besieged intelligence community
continued to escalate. A senior FBI official sought to explain to
members of Congress at a separate closed hearing why he had failed to
connect terrorism leads in Phoenix and Minneapolis, while CIA
officials defended their handling of intelligence information in the
weeks and months leading up to Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   With Tuesday's start of closed-door hearings before the joint
House-Senate intelligence committee, Congress has now clearly seized
control of the debate over whether the U.S. intelligence community
missed warning signs that could have allowed authorities to prevent
the hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators have already begun collecting more
than 400,000 documents from government agencies, and the agenda laid
out by panel leaders Tuesday after their meeting allows them to go
back to 1986, the year the CIA's counter-terrorism center was
created, in examining the U.S. response to terrorism. That period
will include the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, as
well as more recent attacks on U.S. embassies and facilities
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important for us to go back. The farther we go back,
the more we learn ... from our mistakes," Sen. Richard C. Shelby of
Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee,
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Congress, however, continued to push for an
independent commission to investigate the intelligence failures
surrounding Sept. 11, saying that Congress is not up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that, with every recent revelation
of missed warning signals, the call for an independent commission
"gains momentum.... Sooner or later, we're going to win. The American
people deserve a thorough and complete investigation."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, however, reiterated his strong opposition to that
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about distractions from this perspective: I want
the Congress to investigate, but I want a committee to investigate,
not multiple committees to investigate, because I don't want to tie
up our team when we're trying to fight this war on terror," Bush told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Bush added that investigators have to be careful to "guard the
methodology" used by the intelligence community in its
counter-terrorism operations. "It's important for us to not reveal
how we collect information. That's what the enemy wants."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, Bush acknowledged in his most explicit
terms to date that the counter-terrorism system had not worked as
designed before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of whether or not the FBI and the CIA were communicating
properly, I think it is clear that they weren't," Bush said. "Now
we've addressed that issue. The CIA and the FBI are now in close
communications, there's better sharing of intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   A Surprise on Anthrax</TE>
<TE>   The decision to investigate the still-unsolved anthrax attacks as
part of the intelligence committee's scope was something of a
surprise and came only after at least one member insisted that it be
included, according to a congressional source who asked not to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   "That broadens the scope. The only real debate was over anthrax,
and [the members] had to figure out a way to accommodate that," the
source said. The result, part of a seven-point plan developed by the
joint panel, was a decision to look at how well the intelligence
community has investigated biological, chemical, radiological or
nuclear threats, including the anthrax attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby said the anthrax attacks, which killed five people and have
stymied the FBI in its efforts to find a culprit, are relevant to the
investigation. "I don't think we should close our eyes to anything.
As surely as night follows day, we'll be hit with biological and
chemical weapons," Shelby said.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the 37-member joint panel emerged from their three-hour
meeting, held in a sound-proofed room at the Capitol, with bipartisan
pledges of cooperation. They also condemned the recent rash of
finger-pointing within the intelligence community.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), who heads the Senate Intelligence
Committee, called the joint inquiry a milestone for Congress and a
rare instance of two standing committees from two chambers working as
one. "There is no set of precedents."</TE>
<TE>   Graham will alternate with Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman
of the House Intelligence Committee, in chairing the hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're off and running with momentum," Goss said, promising a
"fact-driven, witness-driven" review. Goss said no decision had been
made on who will testify before the committee, which is scheduled to
hold its first public hearings at the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   A senior FBI official at the center of a key breakdown was called
Tuesday before a separate closed-door hearing of Senate Judiciary
Committee staff members to explain the FBI's performance.</TE>
<TE>   David Frasca, head of the FBI's Radical Fundamentalists Unit, led
Washington's much-criticized supervision of the Minneapolis field
office's investigation into suspected "20th hijacker" Zacarias
Moussaoui last summer. A memo written in July by a Phoenix FBI agent
about the threat posed by Middle Eastern flight students was also
sent to his attention, and members of Congress have demanded to know
why the FBI failed to connect the threats.</TE>
<TE>   Frasca told committee staffers that two research analysts in his
11-person unit didn't give the memo to him at the time, and he was
unsure whether anyone in his office had done any research of name
traces on the people identified in the memo, according to
congressional sources familiar with the briefing. Frasca said the
first time he saw the memo was in October, after the Justice
Department inspector general's office, which is reviewing the FBI's
handling of pre-Sept. 11 intelligence, informed him of it.</TE>
<TE>   Frasca's comments "say that nobody in that office was putting two
and two together. You'd think one person would have remembered that
Phoenix memo," a congressional official said.</TE>
<TE>   Frasca also told the committee that on four separate occasions he
brought the Minneapolis office's request for a secret search warrant
on Moussaoui to the FBI office that handles those requests, sources
said. But FBI officials in Washington agreed that there was not
enough evidence linking Moussaoui to terrorists to justify the
request.</TE>
<TE>   That decision was heavily criticized in a letter last month from
Minneapolis FBI agent and lawyer Coleen Rowley, who is expected to
meet privately with several senators today and will testify publicly
before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   CIA Hit by Criticism</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of the intelligence failures has shifted in part from
the FBI to the CIA in recent days amid allegations that the agency
failed to share or act on information about threats, but on Tuesday
CIA officials defended their performance in several of the episodes
that have come under attack.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview in Tuesday's
New York Times that his country had warned U.S. intelligence
officials of a vague but serious and impending attack a week before
the Sept. 11 hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   But a CIA official who asked not to be identified said the agency
''received no such warning.'' The Egyptians had passed on
intelligence months earlier about Al Qaeda intelligence they had
picked up, but such information was fairly commonplace, did not refer
to hijackings or attacks on U.S. soil and was ''not anything like
what was represented'' by Mubarak, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt also downplayed the significance of Mubarak's comments
Tuesday. The intent of Mubarak's remarks, said spokesman Nabil Osman,
was to emphasize that ''Egypt has been cooperating with the United
States on the campaign against international terrorism dating back
many years, as we are veterans of terrorism in our own country. The
cooperation in this field is an ongoing process. It's nothing new.''</TE>
<TE>   The CIA has also come under criticism for allegedly poor
coordination with the FBI in tracking Sept. 11 hijackers Khalid
Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, who were allowed into the country and
then lived openly in the San Diego area despite suspicions that they
had ties to terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA official insisted Tuesday that, despite the FBI's
insistence that it was kept in the dark, the CIA sent electronic
communication to the FBI about Almihdhar both in January 2000, when
his name came up in connection with a suspicious meeting in Malaysia,
and a year later, when his link to a suspect in the bombing of the
U.S. destroyer Cole was confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   A Jan. 5, 2000, cable about the Malaysian meeting said that ''the
FBI already has the facts'' on the case, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   ''The point of the matter is that the [FBI] was aware of this,''
the CIA official said.</TE>
<TE>   What remains unclear, however, is what the FBI did with that
information, what the State Department and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service were told, and why the two men were allowed
into the country despite the CIA's suspicions. Members of Congress
said they want to explore that issue in depth as part of their
ongoing investigation.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Knew of Attack Plans Worse Than 9/11, Prosecutors Say</HD>
<DH>Courts: Failure to warn is the same as active engagment in
anti-U.S. plots, attorneys argue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Before his capture last fall in Afghanistan, John Walker Lindh knew
of plans for 20 suicide attacks "even worse" than those of Sept. 11,
involving as many as 50 people working under Osama bin Laden's
terrorist umbrella, the government alleged Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors did not specify the source of this new
information. But they made it clear in court papers that their case
against the 21-year-old from Northern California is "principally
based on ... Lindh's incriminating statements to the FBI."</LD>
<LD>   Further, while not directly tying Lindh to the death of CIA Agent
Johnny "Mike" Spann, the first U.S. combat fatality in the war on
terror, prosecutors nevertheless stressed that Lindh could have tried
to alert "his fellow American" that his life was in danger in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   "Instead," the prosecutors said, "he chose silence."</TE>
<TE>   With this allegation, the government is fortifying its portrayal
of Lindh as someone who was in the thick of an ambitious effort to
mount a campaign of terror against the United States and shares
responsibility for it.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the defense is presenting Lindh as a student of Islam
who was trained to be a soldier for the Taliban and never purposely
took up arms against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys did not immediately respond to the new
revelations.</TE>
<TE>   The government's new details were filed in federal court in
Alexandria, Va., where Lindh is to stand trial in August. The filing
was in response to a defense request that the charges against Lindh
either be dismissed, or the case moved to San Francisco because of
what the defense team calls too much pro-prosecution sentiment in the
Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors argued that it was the defense, not the
prosecution, that was stirring up "intense media coverage" to portray
their client as a "gentle, sweet youth, as a devoted practitioner of
his faith, and as a loyal American."</TE>
<TE>   The government also mocked the defense team's idea that Lindh's
home was in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a curious assertion given that Lindh left this country in
February 2000 and, despite repeated entreaties from his family to
come home, refused to do so," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving California, Lindh journeyed to Central Asia to study
the Muslim faith, according to his parents.</TE>
<TE>   But the government contends that Lindh instead joined an Al Qaeda
training camp and agreed to take up arms against Americans. That is
at the heart of the case against him; if convicted, he faces a
maximum sentence of life in prison with no parole.</TE>
<TE>   "The events of Sept. 11--and Lindh's clear understanding of who
was behind it--prove that Lindh knew he was in league with a group of
individuals dedicated to the murder of Americans," the government
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lindh knew, even before he got to the Al-Farooq training camp,
that he was joining a camp that was an Al Qaeda/Osama bin Laden
operation. Lindh also knew that Al Qaeda/Osama bin Laden's purpose
was to fight Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "As early as June 2001, Lindh also knew that terrorist
acts--specifically 20 suicide operations involving 50
operatives--were being planned by his Al Qaeda associates and that
his fellow Americans might well be the targets of those attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said that the assaults on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon "confirmed what Lindh already knew--Al Qaeda was
determined to murder Americans."</TE>
<TE>   They said Bin Laden visited Lindh at the training camp and
"personally thanked him for participating in Jihad," a clear sign to
Lindh that Bin Laden "was behind the terror of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   They added: "Lindh also knew that future terrorist acts were
planned, that these were likely to be even worse than the events of
Sept. 11, and that these were targeted against his fellow Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also outlined a number of statements Lindh made to a
CNN reporter after his capture in Afghanistan, such as that it was
the "goal of every Muslim" to be a martyr, as further evidence that
Lindh was brazenly threatening his fellow countrymen.</TE>
<TE>   That was a similar argument to one the government made about Lindh
and the death of Spann. While conceding that Lindh did not personally
fire the bullet that killed the CIA agent, prosecutors said he
indirectly led Spann to his death by not warning him that his life
was in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   The two men met at a prison fort in Afghanistan, where Lindh had
been captured. Spann and another agent, identified only as CS-1,
tried to interview Lindh, but Lindh did not cooperate. Shortly
afterward, a prison revolt erupted and Spann was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "Here they were," the government said, "in the middle of a
fortress in Northern Afghanistan, and Lindh was being offered a last
chance to extricate himself, to withdraw from, to renounce the
conspiracy" led by Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "What he could have told Mr. Spann and CS-1 was this: I am, like
you, an American. I have met Osama bin Laden. I have spoken with him.
I have trained at Al-Farooq....I am ready to talk."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he refused to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   By that inaction, the government asserted, Lindh "did personally
kill Mr. Spann."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also responded to an earlier defense contention that
Lindh was held incommunicado for 54 days without access to his San
Francisco lawyer, or mail from his family, while in custody in
Afghanistan and aboard the Peleliu. "Not quite" true, the government
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, prosecutors said:</TE>
<TE>   "During this 54 days, Lindh was visited twice by the Red Cross,
dictated a letter to his parents (which his parents received),
dictated a second letter to his parents (which was also delivered),
was visited by a chaplain aboard the Peleliu, received letters from
his mother and father, and even received a letter from defense
counsel."</TE>

<HD>House Backs Port Security Bill in Fight on Terrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Now that Congress has enacted laws to secure the nation's air travel
system from terrorists, the House approved legislation Tuesday
designed to protect Americans from attack at the nation's 361 ports.</LD>
<LD>   But protecting the waterfront from terrorists could prove far more
complicated than safeguarding the skies.</LD>
<LD>   While the air travel system has received far more attention,
security experts worry about the vulnerability of ports to an attack
that could cripple the U.S. economy. Of special concern are the
thousands of cargo containers arriving every day that could be used
to sneak terrorists or dangerous weapons into the country.</LD>
<TE>   The House bill would authorize U.S. security sweeps of foreign
ports, expand the Coast Guard's authority to direct ships and provide
$225 million in security grants to U.S. ports. Some of that is
expected to go to the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex, the
nation's busiest with more than 1 million passengers, 5,500
commercial vessels and $170 billion in commerce annually.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would put in place a number of measures to better
screen the 6 million cargo containers that arrive in U.S. ports every
year. Only a fraction of the 20- to 40-foot-long metal boxes are
physically inspected, although customs officials check cargo lists
and target suspicious containers for a closer look.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James L. Oberstar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House
Transportation Committee, said the bill would close "another hole" in
America's defense shield. "We have 95,000 miles of coastline in the
United States. We have to protect that coastline and our ports."</TE>
<TE>   While aviation security legislation was approved about two months
after the Sept. 11 attacks, port security has been more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers want to increase security at ports but do not want to
slow down the U.S. economy and impair the ability of businesses and
farmers in their states to reach global markets.</TE>
<TE>   And ports are difficult to protect because of their size and
immense operations. "Look at the Port of New Orleans," said Coast
Guard Capt. Mike Lapinski. "It stretches up one side of the river and
down the other side about 100 miles."</TE>
<TE>   The House bill is similar to a measure passed by the Senate last
year, virtually ensuring that a port security bill will be sent to
the president soon.</TE>
<TE>   But one issue that still needs to be resolved is whether
individuals who have served time for felony convictions, such as a
drug offense, will be barred from working in secure areas.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill is patterned after the aviation security bill,
which denies workers security-sensitive jobs if they have been
convicted of any of more than two dozen felonies. Industry officials
say dockworkers should be held to the same standard as airport
workers. The House bill, which the unions prefer, would let federal
transportation authorities decide what crimes to consider in
determining whether a worker poses a terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   Although port officials were pleased with progress on the
legislation, they said it did not provide enough money.</TE>
<TE>   The House measure would give $225 million to ports for security
improvements, the Senate bill $390 million. (The Senate measure in
total provides slightly more than $1 billion, but much of it goes to
hiring additional customs agents and purchase of screening
equipment.)</TE>
<TE>   The amount going directly to ports is far less than the $2 billion
that an anti-crime commission said was needed to secure ports before
Sept. 11. And, when the Department of Transportation recently invited
ports to apply for $93 million in security funds allocated in
December, the agency received requests for almost $700 million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the American Assn. of Port Authorities, which represents
public port authorities, applauded the House vote. "Greater resources
for continued improvements in security at our nation's ports are
critical," said Kurt J. Nagle, the association's president.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Los Angeles port declined to comment, noting that
the city had not yet taken a position on the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also would set a June 30, 2003, deadline for
authorities to develop an "anti-terrorism cargo identification and
screening system" for cargo containers.</TE>
<TE>   No one expects every cargo container to undergo the kind of
screening planned for airline baggage. But the measure requires
shippers to transmit cargo information to U.S. authorities before the
cargo reaches port, something that most shippers have been
voluntarily doing since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Customs officials are also moving to assign inspectors to foreign
ports in an effort to intercept suspicious cargo bound for the United
States. On Tuesday, Singapore became the first port outside North
America to announce plans to work with the U.S. Customs Service in
screening U.S.-bound cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Although customs does not physically inspect every container, it
does use the information to single out suspicious cargo. Customs
officials say they are beginning to use "e-seals" on cargo that send
out an alarm if a container is opened, and they are exploring
electronic systems to track containers.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation also requires ships to electronically transmit
passenger and crew manifests before arrival. Coast Guard officials
say the manifests now are often handwritten and faxed, making it
difficult for authorities to read them and check names against FBI
and INS databases.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jessica Garrison in Los Angeles contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>S. Dakota Governor Wins GOP Primary for House Seat</HD>
<DH>Politics: Voters in six other states choose nominees for
November congressional, gubernatorial races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SIOUX FALLS, S.D.</DL>
<LD>In a battle between two of the state's political heavyweights,
term-limited Gov. William Janklow easily defeated former Sen. Larry
Pressler on Tuesday to win the Republican nomination for South
Dakota's lone House seat.</LD>
<LD>   He will face an opponent half his age this fall: Stephanie
Herseth, the 31-year-old granddaughter of a former governor, won the
Democratic primary over three opponents.</LD>
<LD>   In the night's biggest surprise, former state lawmaker Michael
Rounds won the GOP nomination for the open governor's seat by
defeating state Atty. Gen. Mark Barnett and wealthy former Lt. Gov.
Steve Kirby.</LD>
<TE>   Rounds will face Democrat Jim Abbott this fall.</TE>
<TE>   On the busiest primary day so far, voters in Montana, Iowa,
Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico and Alabama also set matchups for
November in the race for control of Congress and governors' mansions.
All 435 House seats will be at stake, along with 34 of the 100 Senate
seats and governorships in 36 states.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa Republican Rep. Greg Ganske overcame a stronger-than-expected
challenge from conservative farmer Bill Salier to win the chance to
face Democratic incumbent Sen. Tom Harkin in November, while South
Dakota and Montana Republicans also selected challengers for
Democratic Senate incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   In the Iowa gubernatorial primary, Doug Gross, former chief of
staff for former GOP Gov. Terry Branstad, narrowly avoided a runoff
and will face Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   In Alabama, Democratic Gov. Donald Siegelman and Republican Rep.
Bob Riley easily won their parties' nominations for governor, setting
up a showdown Nov. 5 that will focus on education and ethics.</TE>
<TE>   Siegelman brushed aside opponents who had focused on Alabama's
sagging economy and an ethics probe of his administration. Riley, a
three-term congressman, won a nasty campaign against Lt. Gov. Steve
Windom and businessman Tim James, the conservative son of a former
governor.</TE>
<TE>   In New Jersey, millionaire businessman Douglas Forrester won the
Republican nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli,
whose first term has been shadowed by a campaign finance
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I am here to say to New Jersey that help is on the way,"
Forrester said in declaring victory to his cheering supporters.</TE>
<TE>   In the state's other big race, conservative state lawmaker Scott
Garrett won the GOP primary to succeed Republican Rep. Marge Roukema,
who had warned that choosing him might cost the party the seat this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats need to pick up seven seats to take control of the House
for the first time since 1995. Garrett is backed by House Majority
Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Garrett will face ophthalmologist Anne Sumers, a self-proclaimed
"Roukema Republican" who rejoined the Democratic Party just this
year.</TE>
<TE>   In New Mexico, Democrat Bill Richardson and Republican John
Sanchez won gubernatorial bids.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, a freshman state lawmaker considered a rising star in the
Republican Party, defeated two-term Lt. Gov. Walter Bradley and two
other candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old Sanchez will face a well-funded veteran politician
with a long resume: Richardson, 54, is a former congressman, Clinton
administration official and United Nations ambassador. He faced only
a write-in candidate.</TE>
<TE>   There is no incumbent in the race. Republican Gov. Gary Johnson
was barred from seeking re-election because he has served two
consecutive terms.</TE>
<TE>   In Montana, Republicans chose farmer and state Sen. Mike Taylor to
challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Max Baucus.</TE>

<HD>Key 9/11 Planner Is Named</HD>
<DH>Terror: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a top Bin Laden officer,
probably was a mastermind of the attacks, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. intelligence officials believe they have identified a mastermind
of the Sept. 11 attacks--a mysterious Kuwaiti already wanted for his
alleged role in a 1995 plot to bomb a dozen U.S. airliners over the
Pacific Ocean, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like he's the man, quite honestly," one Bush
administration official said of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a key
lieutenant to Osama bin Laden. "We believe he is probably the leader
of this. We have reason to believe it was his idea to create the plan
for the four hijackings and [that he] discussed the plan with ... Bin
Laden."</LD>
<LD>   The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he had
been briefed recently on Mohammed's alleged role in the attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and was told that the
information was coming from the interrogations of "various people,"
including Al Qaeda members in custody.</LD>
<TE>   In particular, captured Al Qaeda leader Abu Zubeida has told his
interrogators of Mohammed's role in the plot, according to the Bush
administration official and a second U.S. official. Both spoke to The
Times on the condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing investigation
and the fact that Mohammed is still at large and believed to be
hiding somewhere in Afghanistan or Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   A third person, an FBI counterterrorism official closely involved
in the investigation, also described Mohammed as "perhaps the most
wanted" of Al Qaeda operatives, possibly even more so than Bin Laden
and top aide Ayman Al-Zawahiri, because of his direct operational
role in various terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times two weeks ago, that FBI official
would not specifically discuss Mohammed's role in the suicide
hijackings but cited him as a key fugitive who figures prominently in
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials, though, downplayed Mohammed's role. ''He's one of
the people believed to be behind it. It may be a stretch to say he's
the mastermind,'' said a U.S. intelligence official. ''It's not clear
at this point what role he played.''</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, who is believed to be 36 or 37 years old, was designated
one of the Bush administration's 22 most-wanted terrorists after the
Sept. 11 attacks. He was linked not to Sept. 11, but to the 1995 plot
to blow up airliners. Authorities had placed a $25-million bounty on
his head.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent weeks, those authorities have come to believe that
Mohammed discussed the Sept. 11 plot in detail before the attacks not
only with Bin Laden but also with Zubeida, who was an operational
commander for Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Zubeida put Bin Laden's global vision for a
worldwide Islamic state into action by orchestrating a series of
terrorist attacks, managing the training camps in Afghanistan and
serving as a liaison with terrorist cells around the world. Tuesday's
disclosures are also the first indication that Zubeida has been tied
directly to the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida, a Palestinian who is believed to be about 31, was
captured in a raid in Pakistan in late March. He has been
interrogated almost continually since recovering from gunshot wounds
suffered when he tried to escape.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration official said Zubeida's identification of
Mohammed as a key orchestrator of the Sept. 11 attacks occurred over
the last two months and that U.S. authorities have been able to
corroborate significant elements of his story. The official said such
independent corroboration is important because authorities have been
highly skeptical of some of the information provided by Zubeida, a
hardened terrorist with no obvious reason to help the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Information from Zubeida has prompted authorities in recent weeks
to go public about potential terrorist attacks on U.S. banks,
shopping malls and even the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of
Liberty--even when they could not find any independent corroboration
or even a time, date or place for such attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration official speculated that Zubeida may have
identified Mohammed as a way of taunting U.S. military forces in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Zubeida is definitely talking. I think he knows that Mohammed is
alive and on the loose and that we won't be able to catch him," said
the official. "Who knows? It's all pop psychology at this point.
[But] I'm very confident that there were discussions with Mohammed
and Abu Zubeida over what ultimately became the 9/11 attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have long believed that Mohammed played a significant
role in Al Qaeda, ranking one or two levels below Zawahiri and
Mohammed Atef, Al Qaeda's military commander, in the terror network's
hierarchy. They also think he was involved in the 1998 truck bombings
of two U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 224 people, including 12
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "The point here is that we knew of Mohammed prior to 9/11, but no
one knew the role he had in the organization, or his significance,
until we began the interrogations," the Bush administration official
said. "Our knowledge base of him was limited. But now we know he is
an extremely significant player in the Al Qaeda hierarchy."</TE>
<TE>   The official said the investigation into Mohammed's alleged role
in the plot, and within Al Qaeda, is proceeding at a breakneck pace
now that authorities have leads to follow. Already, they believe that
Mohammed participated in planning the financial aspects of the Sept.
11 plot as well as conceiving and orchestrating it.</TE>
<TE>   The second U.S. official who confirmed that Zubeida has identified
Mohammed as a key orchestrator of the attacks said Pentagon
interrogators gleaned the information from him. He would not say
where Zubeida is being held or what other information has been
released to the White House and to the Justice and State departments.</TE>
<TE>   For years, U.S. authorities have quietly investigated Mohammed for
his alleged role in Bojinka, the terrorist plot based in the
Philippines to blow up airliners flying routes to the United States
from Southeast Asia in January 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In a test run, a small bomb was detonated aboard one plane and a
man was killed, but the plane did not crash. U.S. authorities and
their Asian counterparts uncovered the larger plot after a fire broke
out in Mohammed's apartment in Manila.</TE>
<TE>   The conspiracy was orchestrated by suspected Al Qaeda operative
Ramzi Yousef, who was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison
without the possibility of parole for his role in the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing. Yousef was also implicated in a 1995 plot to
crash a small plane into CIA headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   When unveiling their ''most-wanted list'' in October, U.S.
authorities said Mohammed went by many aliases, including Ashraf
Refaat Nabith Henin, Khalid Adbul Wadood, Salem Ali and Fahd bin
Abdullah bin Khalid.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff--who is heading
the Sept. 11 inquiry--described Mohammed as a fugitive ''at large
from one of the plots that didn't go off.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Ramzi Yousef, who's one of the masterminds among the terrorists,
had a plan to blow up 12 airliners over the ocean and kill hundreds
of people,'' Chertoff said in an interview in December on CNN's
''Larry King Live.'' ''They actually tried a test run and exploded a
small device on a plane, killed somebody. Ultimately, through good
luck and good investigative work, the plot was foiled.''</TE>
<TE>   ''This particular individual,'' Chertoff said of Mohammed, ''is
one of the fugitives in the case.''</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed also uses several birth dates, including April 14, 1965,
and March 1, 1964, according to the FBI. Authorities describe him as
having black hair and brown eyes and being slightly overweight. He
also wears glasses on occasion, has olive skin and may or may not
wear a beard, according to his wanted poster, which has been
distributed worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also says Mohammed was born in Kuwait, but even that is a
matter of dispute.</TE>
<TE>   In December, when his name was circulated on the most-wanted list,
Kuwaiti leaders officially disassociated themselves from Mohammed,
saying he was ''not a Kuwaiti,'' as U.S. and European officials had
claimed.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Kuwaiti editors, Kuwait's information
minister, Sheik Ahmed Fahd Al Ahmed Al Sabah, said Mohammed was
actually a Pakistani national who was born in Kuwait and that people
born in Kuwait don't automatically qualify for citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said the Justice Department has
identified 23 people in the United States with various levels of
''terrorist ties.'' At least one of them allegedly had links to Al
Qaeda, according to officials who said the men are either in custody
or are being closely watched.</TE>
<TE>   Information about the suspects was given to the FBI, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Bob Drogin contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>INS Detains Flight Student Named in Pre-Sept. 11 FBI Memo</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: The alleged Mideast extremist came under suspicion
during Arizona pilot training.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN and RICH CONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the eight alleged Middle East extremists named in the FBI
"Phoenix memo" has been taken into custody by federal anti-terrorism
agents in Arizona for alleged violation of immigration laws.</LD>
<LD>   Zakaria Soubra, a longtime flight school student who came to the
attention of FBI agents in Phoenix more than a year before the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, is being held at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's detention facility in Florence, outside
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   An INS official refused to say how long Soubra has been in custody
or whether he was being held without bail.</LD>
<TE>   A lawyer representing Soubra declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   One federal law enforcement source said the 25-year-old Lebanese
national was taken into custody hours after Phoenix-based FBI Agent
Kenneth Williams testified on May 23 before a U.S. Senate
intelligence panel. In his five-page memo written last July, Williams
warned that Islamic extremists were attending U.S. flight schools and
could have terrorist ties. Soubra was one of the flight school
students mentioned in the memo to FBI headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The same federal source said Soubra was being held without bond
after being taken into custody by INS agents assigned to a Joint
Terrorism Task Force in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Records and interviews show FBI agents have been interested since
at least early 2000 in Soubra's attendance at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz., as well as his membership
in Al Muhajiroun, a hard-line anti-American group that some
intelligence agents suspect is linked to Osama bin Laden's terrorist
network, Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   It was partly the concern about the London-based Al Muhajiroun and
connections to flight schools that prompted Williams' memo.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not alleged any links between Soubra and
September's hijackers. But investigators long ago established that
one of the 19 terrorists, Hani Hanjour, first came to Arizona in the
mid-1990s and trained at local flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   Soubra has acknowledged stirring political controversy in Arizona.
He organized a Tempe street demonstration protesting Russia's war in
Chechnya, arranged a critical discussion of the U.S. presence in
Yemen at Embry-Riddle and was asked to leave a mosque after
criticizing members for supporting non-Islamic governments in the
U.S. and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last fall with The Times, Soubra said, "We are
promised by the prophet that Islam will rule the whole world." The
U.S. and other Western governments must be removed using intellectual
and political means, he said. But Soubra condemned the attacks of
Sept. 11 as a violation of Islamic law because they targeted
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of interesting aspects to him," said the federal
law enforcement source. "He wasn't being investigated for violating
his student visa, that's for sure."</TE>

<HD>Artists Give N.Y. Mayor a Bad Rap on Teacher Pay</HD>
<DH>Education: At a large rally, hip-hop musicians blast
Michael R. Bloomberg for failing to approve raises and proposing more
cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A coalition of America's leading hip-hop artists joined forces with
New York City teachers Tuesday to protest $1 billion in budget cuts
for the nation's largest public school system.</LD>
<LD>   At a noisy City Hall rally, Hip-Hop Summit organizer Russell
Simmons and a host of speakers blasted Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for
failing to approve a pay raise for teachers, who have been working 18
months without a contract.</LD>
<LD>   "Many of you don't have desks at school, many of you bring home
Xeroxed papers to read instead of real textbooks because of budget
cuts," Simmons told the crowd of several thousand people, most of
them high school students who had been urged in radio spots to
attend. "We're not here to play music for you today.... We're here to
stand up for schools, teachers and kids."</LD>
<TE>   Besides Simmons, celebrities included Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, P.
Diddy, L.L. Cool J, Chuck D., Reverend Run, Erykah Badu and Big
Tigger. Although the dais also included local ministers, community
activists and New York city politicians, it was clear whom the
swelling crowd had come to see.</TE>
<TE>   "Jay-Z's the man!" high school senior James Washington said.
"They're trying to cut schools, the budget. But we're going to win
this thing."</TE>
<TE>   The rally underscored a long-running feud between Bloomberg and
the United Federation of Teachers over who should control the city's
faltering public schools. The Republican mayor, who has been pressing
state legislators to give him greater powers to run the schools, has
withheld approval of a pay raise for teachers until the control issue
is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg declined to comment on Tuesday's rally except to say
that he would be standing firm in his demands and his overall
negotiating strategy. Although the mayor had been scheduled to submit
his final budget proposal for the city's schools today, aides said
that decision has been delayed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to negotiate a contract in the press," Bloomberg
said, hours before the streets near City Hall began filling up with
students, teachers and parents, many holding signs and placards. "I
think real progress is being made, and I believe we'll get a contract
that pays the teachers and also gives us more flexibility in trying
to improve our public schools."</TE>
<TE>   But state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a New York City
Democrat and strong ally of the teachers union, has yet to sign off
on a sweeping reorganization promoted by Bloomberg that would abolish
the politically powerful board of education and give the mayor the
power to hire all school district leaders.</TE>
<TE>   A key disagreement is that the mayor wants to take total control
of the school budgets away from city council members and state
legislators. Silver also has insisted that Bloomberg promise to
forego further budget cuts in the public schools unless the city
faces a fiscal catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides reportedly are moving closer to agreement, although the
complex deal still could fall apart in the coming weeks. If it is
approved, Bloomberg would be the first New York mayor in more than 25
years to follow through on a campaign promise to take charge of the
city's beleaguered public schools.</TE>
<TE>   What he actually might be able to accomplish is debatable, given
the city's $5-billion budget deficit. New York cut $450 million from
schools in former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's final budget, and
Bloomberg, citing a "doomsday scenario," has said he may now have to
cut an additional $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "How much more of this can we take?" asked UFT President Randi
Weingarten, citing a litany of school woes. "How many of you have had
a really good teacher leave because she couldn't put up with these
conditions?" she asked the crowd. "This is all about your future."</TE>
<TE>   Union officials are projecting that as many as 10,000 veteran
teachers will quit the New York schools this year for better-paying
suburban jobs. Bloomberg's threatened cuts would drive even more
teachers away, creating a "brain drain" among qualified city
educators, Weingarten added.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't enough books for our kids, and the schools are
falling apart," said Jay-Z. "If you don't learn, you suffer. You have
no future to live for."</TE>
<TE>   For Alex Cross, a Bronx high school senior, the message of the
rally was simple: "People are always saying we're the hope of the
future. If that's true, how can you not have enough textbooks? How
can you have classes that are too big? If we're the future, how can
you allow this?"</TE>

<HD>Bush Threatens to Veto Expanded Anti-Terror Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An emergency spending bill sought by the White House to pay for
anti-terrorism efforts has ballooned in cost so much that President
Bush is now threatening to veto it.</LD>
<LD>   Joining Bush in attacking the measure is his erstwhile Republican
rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who criticized the bill Tuesday
as an exercise in pork-barrel spending that the nation can ill
afford.</LD>
<LD>   The version being debated by the Democrat-run Senate totals $31
billion--$4 billion more than the White House requested to beef up
anti-terrorism efforts at home and abroad after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The bill's bottom line has increased in part because it is laced
with projects that have little to do with domestic and international
security--such as $16 million to aid New England fishermen affected
by federal fishing restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued Tuesday, Bush's Office of Management Budget
said that if the Senate's version of the bill is sent to the White
House, senior advisors would recommend it be vetoed. Bush has yet to
veto a bill.</TE>
<TE>   In its criticism, the White House found an ally in McCain, who in
2000 was Bush's main challenger for the GOP's presidential nomination
and whose legislative initiatives--most notably campaign finance
reform--have often put him at odds with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "The surplus we relied on last year [has] largely disappeared,"
McCain said. "It is unfortunate in a time of war, our colleagues
cannot curb their appetite for non-emergency, wasteful spending."</TE>
<TE>   The administration's veto threat is the opening gambit of what is
likely to be an ongoing struggle between Bush and Congress over
spending in the next several months. Although Bush and most lawmakers
avow concern about the return of budget deficits, there are huge
pressures to spend more freely--both in this emergency bill and in
the 13 regular appropriation bills that Congress must pass to finance
the government in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The politics of this fall's high-stakes battle for control of the
House and Senate are pushing leaders of both parties to back projects
that will help vulnerable members win votes. And with national
anxiety about terrorism running high, no politician wants to risk
stinting on preventive measures.</TE>
<TE>   But McCain complained that the bill before the Senate amounts to
"war profiteering, plain and simple" because, he said, it includes
political pork masquerading as national security measures.</TE>
<TE>   The measure's proponents said Congress has the right and
responsibility to make its own judgments about what it deems urgent
spending. They warned that bickering will delay the delivery of
needed funds. Even after expected Senate passage of the bill,
differences with a version passed by the House must be resolved
before a measure is sent to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to move this train," Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said
Tuesday. "These are resources going to agencies in America that
people desperately need."</TE>
<TE>   At issue are emergency appropriations for the Pentagon's military
operation in Afghanistan, for homeland security programs operated by
the Coast Guard, Justice Department and other domestic agencies and
aid to help New York recover from the damage caused by the Sept. 11
attacks on the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Bush requested $27 billion. The House version, passed in May,
would provide $29 billion. That includes almost $2 billion for the
Pentagon that would be spent only if the administration deemed it
necessary--a move that made the bill acceptable to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The additional money in the Senate bill went too far for the
administration and other fiscal conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), who joined McCain and the White House
in complaining about the bill's price tag, questioned $3.5 million
added to provide training for journalists in the Middle East. That
provision was included at the request of another Republican, Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Other Senate add-ons include $10 million in flood relief for
several states and $2 million for the Smithsonian Institution to
begin planning to move its collection of animals preserved in alcohol
away from downtown Washington. Proponents say the containers are a
flammable hazard that should be located somewhere else.</TE>

<HD>Class-Action Status Ruled Out in Rampart Lawsuit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has declined to grant class-action status to a former
gang member's malicious-prosecution lawsuit against Rampart police
officers.</LD>
<LD>   In a 22-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess wrote that
Raul Rodriguez's case was not sufficiently representative of the
proposed class of victims.</LD>
<LD>   The former 18th Street gang member sought to represent anyone
whose civil rights had allegedly been violated by officers in the Los
Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division since 1990.</LD>
<TE>   He contended that the division had a practice and policy of
violating suspects' rights by making unfounded arrests, using
excessive force, fabricating evidence and lying in court.</TE>
<TE>   But Feess said that because Rodriguez was not himself a victim of
excessive force, he did not have standing to seek relief for those
who were.</TE>
<TE>   In his original lawsuit in 1999, Rodriguez alleged that Rampart
officers tried to frame him for a murder he did not commit. He was
acquitted at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Rodriguez were representative of the broad class of
Rampart victims, Feess suggested, a class-action lawsuit would be
unwieldy.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the court would be forced to conduct hearings for
each member of the class to determine whether his or her maltreatment
resulted from the police division's alleged policy and practice of
abusing crime suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Although Feess said he had no idea how many new plaintiffs might
be brought into the litigation through class-action certification, he
pointed out that more than 150 individual lawsuits have been filed in
federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them have been settled for substantial sums, he said,
suggesting that it might be better for prospective class members to
file their own lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Kamin, one of Rodriguez's lawyers, said that he was
disappointed by the decision but expressed hope that Feess would rule
favorably on another class-action request that is pending.</TE>

<HD>The Business of America Is Out of Control</HD>
<DH>Store aisles and the Internet are becoming vents for
popular anger over corporate greed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last weekend I went shopping for electrical wiring at one of those
sprawling home improvement centers. I encountered an employee who was
battling to keep his temper in check. He was loading items in a
shopping cart and muttering about the world going to pot.</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, his world is.</LD>
<LD>   Customers are quietly rebelling.</LD>
<TE>   For the last six months or so, shoppers have been making a mess in
the section of the store he supervises.</TE>
<TE>   He showed me where paint brushes are misplaced and stuffed in with
circuit boxes, where drapery rings are tossed in with wire nuts,
where a can of custom-mixed paint is left abandoned, now worthless.
Each morning, he loads up a cart with products that customers
brazenly scatter out of place.</TE>
<TE>   This has always been a problem in retail. But this employee says
he's never seen it so bad, and it's getting noticeably worse.</TE>
<TE>   I think I know why. It's a small sign of bigger grief in the land.</TE>
<TE>   You can see it at the grocery store with avocados and bananas that
have been squeezed hard with the intent to ruin them, or in the
finger holes that penetrate the plastic packages at meat counters. I
read it almost every day in my mail. People say it is their
justification for stealing music and movies and software over the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers are mad, and some are declaring petty war against the
mighty corporation, against the shenanigans, the double-dealing, the
get-rich-quick schemes, the fraud, the self-serving deals--the
corporate wrongdoing that splashes into the daily headlines and mocks
American values.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be a retail vandal or an Internet pirate to
understand the ground-level frustration of citizens. It creeps into
many, if not most, of the conversations I have with friends,
sometimes with startling ferocity.</TE>
<TE>   Americans, if I can generalize, are feeling powerless right now.
Not just against the threat of terrorism but against the
overindulgences of their own free-market system and the stubborn
indifference of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   One of the promises of democracy, the essential promise, is that
it will react to crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, it isn't happening. Representative government is
inert against the disclosures of corporate corruption,
corner-cutting, fraud and unfairness.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't seem to matter that the allegations grow more numerous
and shocking by the week. Headlines tell us that Congress is
gridlocked over "reform" of the accounting profession and pension
law.</TE>
<TE>   But look past the rhetoric and you quickly see the arguments
amount to little more than whether to use squirt guns or water
balloons against a high-rise fire. For instance, Congress cannot
agree whether chief executives should have to attest to the honesty
of their company audit reports. You mean they don't already?</TE>
<TE>   Compare that with the far-reaching retirement "reforms" that
business engineered in the late 1970s, when corporations decided they
didn't want to offer direct-paid pensions to workers anymore. The
401(k) system was dreamed up as a gradual replacement. Recent studies
have shown that business saved 14% to 22% in pension costs in the
ensuing years, while the median net worth of American workers, ages
47 to 64, has fallen more than 13%, chiefly as a result of shrinking
retirement nest eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, these changes in pension law explain why today's business
malfeasance has become so gripping, at least outside of Washington.
Our investment markets are no longer a game played primarily by those
who can afford to lose. At last count, 52% of us have our
bread-and-butter retirement hopes tied up in mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   The decline of stocks has meant not just a loss of billions of
dollars in savings for millions of workers, but it also has exposed
levels of social corruption and avarice that the U.S. has not seen
since the Gilded Age at the end of the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   For a family that has watched its retirement shrivel by one-third
while corporate executives rake in nine figures, it is no
satisfaction to hear the Bush administration and timid opposition
Democrats argue over how many contacts Enron had with the White
House. It is of little consolation to listen to regulators promise
that market forces will eventually set things right after taking us
so far off track.</TE>
<TE>   Americans know exactly what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   A Harris Interactive poll conducted in April found that 87% of
those who responded believed that big corporations had too much power
in Washington. This was not a measure of anti-business sentiment so
much as dismay with politics, because an equal 87% said small
companies had too little influence over national policy.</TE>
<TE>   Big corporations have used their power shrewdly. They have
sweet-talked the Republicans into forgetting about the values of law
and order. They have blunted the wage-earner sympathies of the
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   For that privilege, they'll happily pay clerks to restock the
shelves.</TE>

<HD>Korean Elections Will Cast Pall Over 'Sunshine Policy'</HD>
<DH>With a new and harsher president in the South, tensions
with the North will rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie is a senior associate at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., and a
syndicated columnist and political cartoonist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Dec. 19, a day after the South Korean presidential election, the
world will add a panic button to the two existing ones: The dangers
of the North-South Korean conflict will join the Middle East and
Kashmir perils.</LD>
<LD>   Without a doubt, Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's good-natured
president, will be replaced with a tougher, "get the communists"
president who will take a no-nonsense approach toward the most
isolated dictatorship today: North Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Thriving South Korea is a proud nation that suffered tremendously
throughout the last century, and it is eager to carve out a
respectable niche among the advanced nations of the world.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, it invested a fortune--$1.4billion--to build 10 gorgeous
stadiums, where some of this month's World Cup soccer matches will be
held.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea is also a socially conscious nation, with a deep
desire to support its poor and elderly citizens with a social
infrastructure. It is a culture that respects age. It is also a
nation that won't allow any disturbance of its economic security.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has two strong conflicting undercurrents. One is its
people's sincere love and concern for their North Korean brethren,
their flesh and blood (there are 10million people in North and South
Korea whose main dream is to be united with their families on the
other side of the border).</TE>
<TE>   The other undercurrent is the knowledge of the devastating
financial effect that unification would have on the South's growing
economy. The South Koreans noticed the ramifications of the fusion of
East and West Germany and started to bite their nails with anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   The dream of unification, if it comes true, would catapult the
South Koreans back to the early postwar years of scarcity. It would
take care of the North but would sink the South into the poverty it
just managed to crawl out of a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   When I visited President Kim in July 1998, he introduced me to his
foreign, defense and economic ministers. They told me of their plans
and hopes, which seemed somewhat innocent and trusting.</TE>
<TE>   I noted that, when they were looking at the picture of the "big
sunrise of unification," they may have been ignoring the devilish
details.</TE>
<TE>   Kim was very curious to hear what impression his Cabinet made on
foreigners. It was like visiting a remote uncle who had a new
invention, and he was eager for the world to learn of it. In Kim's
case, it was his "sunshine policy" toward the North. Its principle
was basically to stretch two hands toward North Korea, one carrying
an olive branch and the other offering the communist brethren
Coca-Cola and grain--with reunification as a goal. (Food is an
important psychological factor in the Koreas because of the long
years of war that devastated the people's ability to produce food.
When I was the president's guest at his home for a breakfast, his
wife smilingly growled at me for leaving food on the plate.)</TE>
<TE>   The "sunshine policy" initially went well.</TE>
<TE>   Kim won the Nobel Peace Prize for his idea. Dozens of North and
South Korean families held emotional reunions in front of television
cameras. Kim Dae Jung shook hands with North Korean President Kim
Jong Il.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the North proved to be stubborn and insisted on having things
its way. The policy is now faltering.</TE>
<TE>   The South Koreans--smart, earthy and hard-working--on Dec. 18 will
have to choose between serious economic sacrifices and pleasing their
emotional needs for their unification dream.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are that the North will confront in December a new,
harsher, pragmatic South Korean president, a lawyer named Lee Hoi
Chang. He will talk tough and carry a big stick.</TE>
<TE>   Come midnight Dec. 18, add the third panic button.</TE>

<HD>A Sinister Hand Manipulates a Nuclear Crisis</HD>
<DH>If India and Pakistan drag each other over the edge, who
benefits? Al Qaeda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT STEWART</AU>
<BD>Robert Stewart, an Army intelligence analyst from 1990
to 1994, is a writer based in Washington, D.C. E-mail:
trawets67@hotmail.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The Sum of All Fears," the latest movie based on a Tom Clancy
novel, terrorists hope to give rise to a new wave of international
fascism. Realizing that it is impossible for the small group to
topple the United States or Russia, one neo-fascist in the film
explains the plan to pit the two nations against each other and
obliterate them both: "Hitler wasn't crazy, he was stupid. You don't
fight Russia and America. You get Russia and America to fight each
other."</LD>
<LD>   Clancy's scenario, as usual, is all too real. But in a post-Cold
War twist, the U.S. and Russia are not the target.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, terrorists hope to use the potential nuclear crisis
between India and Pakistan to pursue their depraved ends. And rather
than neo-fascists, the current emergency appears to be bred of a
familiar catalyst: Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda followers. By
taking on these terrorists in its own backyard, Pakistan has the
ability to thwart Al Qaeda.</LD>
<TE>   Cross-border incursions by terrorists based in Pakistan-controlled
areas of Kashmir have increased in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks and mounting death toll among Indian civilians led to
a higher state of alert among the Indian military.</TE>
<TE>   Reports from Indian intelligence claim terrorists trained by Al
Qaeda have been among those killed by border troops.</TE>
<TE>   Short of the destruction of the U.S., Bin Laden would love to see,
and would certainly benefit from, the ruin of the anti-terrorist
(and, some say, anti-Muslim) democracy in India.</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneously, a war in South Asia provides Bin Laden with
revenge-by-proxy on the primarily Muslim nation of Pakistan--a
country that, instead of allying with Al Qaeda, is joining the U.S.
on its Western border to help fight the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   As former Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth put it in a
recent interview, Al Qaeda wants Pakistan and India to go to war
because Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf is on Al Qaeda's
most-wanted list.</TE>
<TE>   There is little doubt that Al Qaeda has been active in recruitment
and training in the disputed Kashmir region.</TE>
<TE>   As Newsweek reports this week, at least five Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan were devoted to the training of Kashmiri militants before
American and coalition military action put a lethal end to their
activity.</TE>
<TE>   Although there have been tensions and small regional conflicts
between these neighboring countries for decades, the current conflict
makes little sense: Neither country benefits from the flare-up,
neither aims to annex the other, and the terrorism merely hardens
India's resolve against independence for Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   So the question remains: Who benefits?</TE>
<TE>   If in fact Al Qaeda is fanning the flames, the current situation
not only threatens the world with a nuclear war and divides Pakistan
and India, it also drives a wedge between the U.S. and Musharraf, a
valuable ally in the war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than continuing to praise Musharraf's efforts, President
Bush must now demand that he do more to stop the cross-border
incursions. Musharraf would be forced to do so at a time when the
U.S. is relying on the Pakistani military to help seal the
Pakistan-Afghanistan border and hunt terrorists fleeing and
regrouping in the South Asian nation.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf made a difficult and potentially life-threatening
decision in the days after Sept. 11. He bucked conventional wisdom
and the Arab street to throw his support behind American efforts in
Afghanistan and against many of the Muslim extremists in Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the bold leader must choose an even bolder action. He
must change course and move against terrorists--or "freedom
fighters," depending on your point of view--on the Pakistani side of
the Line of Control in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   None of these actions will be popular within his nation's borders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appeased Adolf
Hitler's Germany and declared "peace in our time."</TE>
<TE>   World War II began a year later.</TE>
<TE>   If Musharraf can remember the mistakes of the past, and learn from
recent success against terror, perhaps World War III will not be
launched from Islamabad.</TE>

<HD>Pork Politics Fuel a $40-Billion Energy Boondoggle</HD>
<DH>This proposed natural gas subsidy has no redeeming
qualities whatsoever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY TAYLOR and ROGER BERLINER</AU>
<BD>Jerry Taylor is the director of natural resource
studies at the Cato Institute in Washington. Roger Berliner, an
attorney in Washington, was legislative director for former Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) from 1978 to 1979.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ready for lots and lots of pork? Congress stands on the precipice of
granting a potential $40-billion subsidy to natural gas investors, a
giveaway that would hurt energy producers, fleece taxpayers and do
gratuitous harm to our most important trading partners.</LD>
<LD>   The giveaway is in the form of a guaranteed "floor" price of $3.25
per million BTUs for natural gas coming from Alaska's North Slope.</LD>
<LD>   The subsidy, included with little fanfare in the Senate energy
bill passed in April, is intended to virtually guarantee the
profitability and therefore the production of sizable natural gas
reserves that have been found in association with North Slope oil.</LD>
<TE>   Even though the economics aren't there to transport the gas
reserves to the market, the necessary political ingredients clearly
are. Many senators were interested in offsetting their opposition to
Alaskan oil drilling with support for increased natural gas
production. Unions support job creation, subsidized or not. Steel
producers see a selling opportunity. And Senate Democrats, who hold
on to power by one vote, want to help Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, a
Democrat, in his race for the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   These political dynamics led the Senate to mandate that any
natural gas pipeline built to carry North Slope gas must be built
through Alaska, even though it's cheaper to go through Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate thus made the economics of North Slope gas worse in two
ways: The project is billions of dollars more expensive to build, and
any leverage the producers had with the state of Alaska to create a
more favorable royalty and tax package was eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Having legislated the more expensive route, the Senate then
apparently felt that it had to make sure it would be built. Thus was
born the guaranteed minimum price.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasts of natural gas prices over the next 15 years are in the
$2.25 range, $1 less than what these producers will get from
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   According to independent studies, the cost to American taxpayers
of this direct subsidy to a handful of players could exceed
$40billion.</TE>
<TE>   The guaranteed profitability of this gas will distort the flow of
capital and goods that otherwise would have run to other sectors of
the natural gas-producing community, including the independent
producers in the Rocky Mountains, the San Juan Basin of northwest New
Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. In effect, this $40-billion taxpayer
gift to a few producers will reduce the economic incentives to
produce natural gas in every other part of North America.</TE>
<TE>   Not only should this subsidy concern our domestic producing
industry, but it also will be troublesome to our North American Free
Trade Agreement partners.</TE>
<TE>   It comes at an awkward time in our trading relationship with
Canada; the U.S. has just slapped a huge tariff on softwood lumber in
response to allegations of subsidies north of the border. It probably
will not be long before Canada retaliates, creating further
dislocations in other sectors of our economy.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, this subsidy is directly contrary to U.S. efforts to
liberalize and privatize major elements of Mexico's energy industry
sector.</TE>
<TE>   What is wrong with this picture? Just about everything.</TE>
<TE>   And what makes the Senate action even more egregious is the fact
that the North Slope gas lies underneath state land, not federal
land.</TE>
<TE>   So Alaska, not the whole country, will earn billions of dollars in
royalties on the production of this natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   And yet all of us will pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which has indicated that it opposes the
subsidy, needs to make sure that the energy bill that emerges out of
the upcoming conference committee does not contain this $40-billion
taxpayer gift to a few at the expense of the rest of us.</TE>

100-year-old funicular contributed to last year's fatal crash. But
these multiple and inexcusable safety problems can be fixed. It would
be a shame if the February 2001 accident scared local leaders away
from once again restoring the Bunker Hill line.</LD>
<LD>   The state Public Utility Commission's report on the crash, which
killed tourist Leon Praport and injured seven other people, leaves
little doubt as to what happened: A cable unraveled from one of the
system's two drums; there were "critical errors" in the design of the
drive system, including the use of gear systems that were
"incompatible and subject to failure"; and track brakes and other
safety features from the original design were never installed.</LD>
<LD>   The result was a terrifying lunchtime accident in which one of the
two cable cars hurtled down the steep track and crashed into its
twin. Passengers inside one of the wooden cars tumbled about wildly
while pedestrians at the top and bottom of the hill watched in
horror.</LD>
<TE>   The PUC, which oversees rail safety, blames the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency, which owned the line; the Angels Flight Railway
Foundation, a fund-raising group; and Angels Flight Operating Co.,
the operating contractor.</TE>
<TE>   Angels Flight first opened on New Year's Eve 1901. The orange and
black cars ferried office workers and tourists up and down Bunker
Hill until 1969, when the line closed as passenger traffic dropped
off.</TE>
<TE>   The 298-foot railroad--which once billed itself as "The Shortest
Paying Railway in the World"--reopened in 1996 after a $4.1-million
restoration and years of effort by preservationists.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the two heavily damaged cable cars are back in cold
storage. Not forever, we hope. The tiny rail line had an almost
unblemished safety record before the crash. The mechanical and
operational problems that caused it can be avoided if the line is
rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC is revamping the way it certifies rail lines as small as
Angels Flight to make sure they are safe. The city and its engineers
should insist on stringent oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Angels Flight, in its short rebirth, was more than a local
attraction and a charming relic of a bygone era. It was a meaningful
link between the immigrant bustle of Broadway and the financial
muscle of Bunker Hill. Rebuild it.</TE>

<LD>Feared by immigrants, despised by nativists, scorned by employers and
rendered uselessly bureaucratic by public officials, the old
Immigration and Naturalization Service may be coming to an end. And
not a day too soon.</LD>
<LD>   The national chorus calling for change in the long-troubled agency
includes President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has introduced a bill (S-2444) that
seeks to terminate the INS and replace it with a new Immigration
Affairs Agency within the Justice Department. The House has passed a
similar bill, but Kennedy's is the stronger of the two.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy's bill seeks to bring the immigration system into the 21st
century by recognizing that most people who come to the United States
share the honorable motivations that have always led people here,
while forcefully addressing the relative few who arrive with less
noble aims, including terrorism. And it has an advantage over the
House version by creating a position at the top of the agency with
new clout and well-defined duties.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's bill would invest this director with authority similar
to that of the FBI's director. As former congressman and longtime
chair of the House Immigration Subcommittee Romano Mazzoli noted at a
hearing, this would put the immigration head in a strong position to
develop, implement and finance immigration policy. It would also
ensure close coordination with the State Department, the FBI, the CIA
and other agencies--power INS commissioners have never had.</TE>
<TE>   Another strong feature of the Senate bill is that it would divide
the agency into an enforcement bureau and a services bureau, each
headed by a deputy director, with a clear chain of command leading to
the director.</TE>
<TE>   This would do away with contradictions that have plagued the INS,
which is charged with both arresting and welcoming immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's bill also would establish an Office of Children's
Services within the new agency to ensure that federal authorities
recognize the special needs and circumstances of unaccompanied
immigrant children.</TE>
<TE>   Clear national consensus on immigration policy remains a distant
goal. In the meantime, Kennedy's new immigration agency, with its
proposed clarity of purpose--keep bad guys out, make life easier for
the good guys who come legally--would be a big improvement on the
current chaos.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration needs a policy on Iraq more detailed than
intense dislike of its dictator, Saddam Hussein. The place for that
policy to start is not with toppling Hussein, at least not until
there's a much better picture of what that would entail and what kind
of regime would succeed him. Begin by insisting that U.N. weapons
inspectors be readmitted by the end of summer and allowed to inspect
anything, anywhere, at any time. Allies skeptical about overthrowing
Hussein can get behind an inspection demand.</LD>
<LD>   In his commencement address to West Point cadets Saturday,
President Bush spoke of "preemptive action" against terrorist
threats, not mentioning Iraq by name and not needing to. Bush's
father built the coalition that drove Iraqi invaders out of Kuwait,
but he did not try to oust the tyrant, believing the Iraqis would do
that themselves. Instead, Hussein crushed his foes. Then, Iraq
allegedly plotted to murder the first President Bush. George W. Bush
took office surrounded by aides believing a "regime change" in Iraq
was necessary to take care of unfinished business.</LD>
<TE>   Hussein dropped poison gas on his own people when he believed them
a threat to his rule and refrained from using chemical weapons in the
Gulf War 11 years ago only because he feared the U.S. pledge of
overwhelming retaliation if he did. He lost the war but retained his
iron grip. If he believed the current U.S. threats to remove him, he
would have little motivation not to use chemical or biological
weapons this time.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the United Nations revamped its sanctions against Iraq
to bar its purchase, without specific approval, of products with
potential military use. In return, the Persian Gulf nation was
promised permits to import food and medicine more easily.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Russia threatened to veto a similar plan in the U.N.
Security Council. Not this time. Since Sept. 11, Russia and the
United States have emphasized similarities in their interests. Though
Moscow is concerned about an attack on Iraq, it has not opposed the
return of weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   If the Security Council insists that Iraq stop stalling, Hussein
has the choice of living without weapons of mass destruction--or
risking his life in a war trying to keep them.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration keeps looking for Iraqi exiles who may be
able to get enough support inside the country to help topple the
tyrant, although that quest has been futile so far. Hussein's brutal
security forces and spies keep turning up real and imagined foes to
be tortured and executed.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein should not be allowed to keep developing and stockpiling
weapons of mass destruction. Intelligence agencies say that's exactly
what he's doing; their reports gain credibility from Baghdad's
refusal to admit inspectors. If the door stays barred, Washington
will have more support from its allies in Europe and elsewhere for
other options.</TE>

<LD>Re "One Misstep Away From Nuclear War," June 2: Pakistan's President
Pervez Musharraf insists that "any sane individual" cannot
contemplate fighting a nuclear war. I agree. What then does this say
about his current deployment of nuclear weapons and about India's
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee doing the same, or about the
military policies of Russia, France, Britain, China or the United
States? Sanity appears to be in short supply.</LD>

<TE>   Your headline could have just as easily been printed anytime in
the last 50 years. As long as nuclear weapons exist, the world will
always be "one misstep away." To a sane person their use is
unthinkable, and the only security from a nuclear holocaust is to get
rid of all nuclear weapons--and that doesn't mean stockpiling them.</TE>
<TE>   William McCall</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Teddy Roosevelt based his foreign policy, at the beginning of the
last century, on the concept "speak softly and carry a big stick."
With President Bush's administration, as this century begins,
identifying numerous "evil" potentially enemy nations and justifying
the possible use of nuclear weapons, including tactical and even
first-strike scenarios, the admonition is unfortunately changing to
"speak loudly and threaten nuclear destruction."</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan are approaching that option. For all of us, may
more sane thinking prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Hessell</TE>

<TE>   Evidently the nations of India and Pakistan, poised on the brink
of nuclear war, have not learned from the tragic consequences of the
atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan; my aunt died there. Man is the
most dangerous animal on Earth because we are self-destructive,
irrational, emotional and unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   A nuclear war will have global consequences. The potential
environmental damage, in addition to untold millions of lives lost,
is a lesson we don't need. Nuclear radiation from fallout will
threaten the Middle East, which supplies the West with much-needed
oil.</TE>
<TE>   Why aren't the environmentalists and peace activists from the West
making a beeline for India and Pakistan to protest? Their silence is
deafening!</TE>

<LD>Re civilian deaths in Afghanistan ("The Untold War," June 2-3):
Thanks to The Times for attempting to account for the thousands of
civilian deaths caused by the U.S. attack on Afghanistan. While the
second report framed those dead Afghans in the context of exaggerated
claims by the Taliban government, it could just as easily have been
framed in the context of U.S. military and government denial and
downplaying of innocent civilians killed while heavy bombing was a
daily occurrence.</LD>
<LD>   I still wonder whether the people who called for war and revenge
after Sept. 11 are happy. Almost as many innocent people were killed
in the U.S. attack on Afghanistan as were killed in the terrorist
attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, not counting
(because no one yet has) the hundreds of thousands more who suffered
and died from starvation exacerbated by the war. Now that they have
their "eye for an eye" can we withdraw our military from Central
Asia?</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Donegan</LD>
<TE>   Berkeley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What is this nonsense that some in Afghanistan want compensation
for the deaths because of the bombings? Did the participants in WWII
compensate the people who were bombed and killed? How about Korea and
Vietnam? So they say that 150 people died in a village near Tora
Bora, an insignificant number if you compare it to London and
Coventry, England; Hamburg and Dusseldorf, Germany; Tokyo; Hiroshima;
Seoul; and Hanoi, to mention a few places that were bombed. Those
folks need to get real and face reality.</TE>

29: Though I agree with Kimmi Kappenberg about reality shows and
cruelty to animals not being entertainment, I had to chuckle in
wonderment. Where do all the poultry and meats we consume in this
world come from? The meat fairy? I don't think the farmers of America

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Spielberg Role as Student a Wrap," June 1: It was with a great
sense of pride that I read the story on Steven Spielberg's graduation
and the completion of his degree. Too many times the stories
associated with celebrities are of a negative nature.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to Spielberg, Shaquille O'Neal and Emmitt Smith (and
others) have returned to school to complete their education. These
are the true role models for our youth. These men have reached the
summit in their respective careers, but the reason that they are role
models is their sense of commitment. O'Neal and Smith made promises
to their families that they would return to school and complete their
degrees. Spielberg's reference to his parents was very touching to
me.</LD>
<LD>   After almost 20 years away from school, I will be earning my
degree this fall. There are many reasons that I went back (career,
income, self-fulfillment), but the main reason is for my family. To
honor my parents and the sacrifices that they made for their
children, and for my children--to be a role model for them. Thank
you, Mr. Spielberg, for being a role model to me.</LD>

<TE>   Spielberg said he wanted to get his bachelor's degree to thank his
parents and show his children the importance of a college education.
But returning to Cal State Long Beach to get his degree is a
monumental message for all young people. Education is so much more
than a means to a good job.</TE>
<TE>   Marlene Bronson</TE>

<TE>   Having learned that Spielberg has received his bachelor's degree,
I am wondering how he did it. Was he required to complete Algebra 1
and 2 and Statistics 110? If there is a way for senior citizens to
return to college and receive a B.A. without this unneeded math it
would be wonderful to learn the secret. Many of us are not
math-oriented but would like the wonderful experience of learning in
a classroom and earning a B.A. Math is the stumbling block to the
fulfillment of a long-held dream.</TE>

<LD>I just read "In Jittery Gaza, Till Peace Do They Stay Apart" (June
3), about Palestinians in the Gaza Strip who cannot plan weddings or
find jobs. No mention was made of the Palestinian suicide bombers who
blew up wedding halls, icecream parlors, markets, billiard parlors,
buses, Seders, etc., in Israel. Am I supposed to feel sorry for these
people who feel solidarity with suicidal maniacs but not for innocent
people who, if they survive, have nails and screws embedded in their
bodies and brains for life?</LD>
<LD>   The Times' reporting should be more balanced and objective. Your
reporter might have explained that they are not working because of
the Palestinian terrorist attacks. The checkpoints have been
established (as well as the shut-off of Palestinian workers in
Israel) to protect the lives of Israelis.</LD>

<LD>Re "How Big a Corporate Disaster Is Needed?" Commentary, May 31:
Bravo, Arianna Huffington! Are she and I the only ones to express
shock and rage over what Congress and the administration are doing
(or not doing) in the aftermath of the Enron/Andersen scandal?</LD>
<LD>   Why isn't there a national uproar of indignation? Why aren't all
the politicians, from President Bush on down, following through with
the appropriate restraints on corporations and accounting firms?
Alas, I think we all know why. Follow the money. This, as Huffington
says, is "democracy at its worst."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "It's Not About Downtown" (editorial, June 2) you wrote of the
need to adhere to the redistricting commission's recommendations of
proposed City Council boundaries. Although I agree that the
commission was a hard-working volunteer group, I do not believe its
role usurps the rights or responsibilities that elected city leaders
have to their constituencies in this matter.</LD>
<LD>   By not challenging the boundaries set by the commission, the 8th
Council District could be severely harmed. This is no small matter
and not merely political squabbling. The lives and destiny of our
community would be decimated by the commission's boundary proposal,
which takes away First AME Church, Trinity Baptist Church, Baldwin
Hills Shopping Center and other resources and aligns them with an
area that has no particular ties to the established communities of
interest. I will not abdicate my responsibility on this issue and
have every right to fight to make sure my constituents are protected.</LD>

<TE>   Having attended many of the public redistricting hearings and
written every member of the commission, I can safely say that
"kowtowing to politicians' interests" is very much alive and well in
our fair city. Public comments have been largely ignored; ask the
folks who will be disenfranchised with the move of the 6th Council
District to the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The new coastal district is anything but a community of interest.
How many Brentwood and Pacific Palisades residents are concerned
about LAX expansion and Playa Vista? Based on the public comments
I've heard, none!</TE>

<TE>   I always thought I knew the difference between Venice and the
Valley, but now I'm confused. The City Council is moving my Venice
6th Council District to the East Valley. They're arguing about
whether my Venice council member should start driving there in July
or December. Meanwhile, I get to vote in November on whether the
Valley should be a separate city. If Councilwoman Ruth Galanter moves
from the Westside in July and secession passes in November, can The
Times help me find out exactly who represents Venice in December? The
answer could certainly help determine how I vote.</TE>

<TE>   The self-centered political powers of L.A. are playing Monopoly
with their constituents--the same constituents who voted for them
during their previous election campaigns. But now they want to dump
some of these households to pick up more lucrative geography that may
just possibly give them more clout and visibility for future
political gain. A suggestion might be to have this so-called
redistricting coincide with the next election in that particular area
so that the voters have more of an input as to who they actually
would want representing them. The political leaders of this city are
always perplexed at why voter turnout drops year after year. They
need to look no further than this current redistricting squabble.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re Councilwoman Galanter's May 30 commentary: To deny the Valley
the new district for a year would be a disaster for L.A. and the
Latino vote. If the City Council is looking toward keeping the city
together, it should think twice before alienating the voters in the
Valley. After attending all of the Valley redistricting meetings and
those downtown and having watched the two Latino coalitions at work,
I'm of the opinion that you might as well wave a red flag in front of
a bull. I'm sure Galanter would do her best to get the new Valley
district off to a great start.</TE>
<TE>   It makes you wonder if some of the council members who are nearing
the end of their careers under term limits are not actually pushing
for splitting up the city so that they can run for a seat on the San
Fernando Valley city council.</TE>

<HD>Barred Travelers Charge 4 Airlines With Race Bias</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Passengers denied passage on post-Sept. 11
flights sue carriers on grounds of discrimination. The firms deny
allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four airlines were sued Tuesday by five passengers who alleged they
were barred from flights after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because
of racial discrimination.</LD>
<LD>   The federal lawsuits against American, United, Continental and
Northwest airlines were filed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Maryland
and New Jersey by the American Civil Liberties Union. The airlines
denied discriminating.</LD>
<LD>   The plaintiffs, two of whom are of Arab descent, were ordered off
planes or not allowed to board after clearing security checkpoints at
airports between October and December, according to the suits.</LD>
<TE>   Four of the plaintiffs are U.S. citizens and the fifth is a
permanent U.S. resident. They ask for declarations that the alleged
practices are illegal, court orders banning them, and in some cases,
unspecified damages.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not enter into this litigation lightly," said Albert
Mokhiber of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a
co-plaintiff in three of the lawsuits. "We do so only after extensive
consultations'' with the airlines and the Department of
Transportation, which have failed to produce results, Mokhiber said.
The committee asked the airlines, the Department of Transportation
and the pilots union to establish guidelines to prevent further
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Department said it is investigating 31
complaints from people who have been prevented from flying since
Sept. 11 and 111 complaints from passengers who said they were
singled out at security screenings because of their appearance. No
conclusions have been reached, according to a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't allow any passenger or crew member who feels
uncomfortable with someone else to exercise veto power over our civil
rights laws," said ACLU staff attorney Ben Wizner, who filed a
complaint on behalf of Assem Bayaa in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Bayaa, 40, who was born in Lebanon and moved to this country in
1976, said he was told to disembark from a United Airlines plane at
Los Angeles International Airport on Dec. 23 after he told a flight
attendant that his final destination was Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Bayaa, an audit manager for Arthur Andersen stationed in Riyadh,
said an airline employee told him the crew was uncomfortable with his
presence on the flight bound for New York. He was given a boarding
pass for the next flight, but declined to use it because the airline
could not guarantee that he would be permitted to fly.</TE>
<TE>   "I will never forget how I felt when I saw that plane leave
without me," he said. "I felt as though the previous 22 years of
freedom I had enjoyed in America had vanished in an instant."</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines spokesman Joe Hopkins said it is against company
policy to discriminate. Added Hopkins: "Behavior is another matter.
If somebody is staring intently at the cockpit, for example, perhaps
a person could be deplaned."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs in the other lawsuits include Arshad Chowdhury of
Pittsburgh, who alleged he was prevented from boarding a Northwest
Airlines flight in San Francisco on Oct. 23. Chowdhury, who is a
Muslim of Bangladeshi descent, said the airline placed a hold on his
name in a database although he had cleared several screenings.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest Airlines spokesman Bill Mellon said the company has
investigated Chowdhury's allegations and found that its employees
"acted in accordance with [Federal Aviation Administration] security
directives and federal regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Chowdhury was barred because the pilot received conflicting
information about whether authorities had cleared him, Mellon said.
"After confirming that authorities cleared him, Northwest
accommodated Mr. Chowdhury by rebooking him on a direct flight
scheduled to arrive at his final destination before his originally
scheduled flight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan Sader, a Virginia resident who was born in Morocco, said he
was asked to get off an American Airlines plane in Baltimore on Oct.
31 after a passenger complained about his presence.</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said the company was
"enormously disappointed" by the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Edgardo Cureg and Michael Dasrath said they were removed from a
Continental Airlines flight in Newark on New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Dasrath, a Brooklyn, N.Y., resident who was born in Guyana, said
he heard a passenger tell the captain, "Those brown-skinned men are
behaving suspiciously." Cureg, a Filipino who lives in Tampa, Fla.,
and Dasrath filed separate suits. The two did not know each other
before the flight.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said: "Continental has a strong policy
and a long-standing policy against discrimination."</TE>

<HD>Irvine Debates Growth Plan</HD>
<DH>Land use: Residents speak out about effects of 3,600-acre
development north of El Toro base. Concerns include traffic and the
city's character.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An eleventh hour grass-roots campaign threatened briefly Tuesday to
derail Irvine's plan to expand the city by a third.</LD>
<LD>   After an occasionally tense, hours-long session, the council at 11
p.m. still had not voted on the plan.</LD>
<LD>   Of dozens of residents who turned out, 17 spoke against the
proposal, which would put houses, businesses and schools on 3,600
acres that are now mostly undeveloped or agricultural. Some cited
concerns about traffic congestion, others about loss of the city's
village character.</LD>
<TE>   Among those urging the City Council to delay action on the
proposal was former Mayor Christina Shea.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about developing an area the size of a small city,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have held public hearings for 18 months and completed
environmental studies for the project, which would add 12,350 homes,
at least four schools, businesses, medical and research facilities.
The new community would be about twice the size of Irvine's
Woodbridge village. Criticism had been muted until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Caustin, founding director of local environmental group Defend
the Bay, particularly objected to loss of agricultural land, accusing
the council of "wiping out the history of Irvine." The city grew from
what was formerly the Irvine family ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Chris Mears chastised Caustin for not attending earlier
community meetings on the project.</TE>
<TE>   After a heated exchange, Caustin threw his hands in the air and
asked, "Why are you picking on me?"</TE>
<TE>   Others asked why the public hearing started at 4 p.m., before many
people get off from work, rather than the council's usual 6 or 6:30
p.m. meeting time.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Chuck Devore asked officials, "What is the rush? Irvine
has been very deliberately planned over 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   A final vote on the development plan will be in 30 days.
Construction of 400 homes along Jeffrey Road could begin in 18
months.</TE>
<TE>   The massive development north of the former El Toro Marine base
will increase the city's population, now 143,000 by about 30,000
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the land to be developed, 4,100 acres in the city's
so-called Northern Sphere will be preserved as open space, including
Irvine's portion of Limestone Canyon Regional Park.</TE>
<TE>   The project, to be built over the next 20 years, would generate
thousands of car trips daily, according to environmental projections.
No freeway improvements are proposed, but the city and the
developer--the Irvine Co.--have agreed to set aside funding just in
case.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commission Chairman Anthony Dragun has said that traffic
will be analyzed as plans for each tract are presented for approval.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that Sand Canyon Road, Portola Parkway and the
Foothill Transportation Corridor, which cut through the area, are
underused and could handle overflow from the San Diego Freeway, which
critics of the new development have said would become gridlocked.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Melvold, who lives in north Irvine, said those assurances are
of little comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "When you figure the roadway infrastructure was constructed
without the intention of this land being developed, it's just
unfathomable to imagine putting all that development in there without
any major new roadways or improvements," Melvold said.</TE>

<HD>F. Belaunde, 89; Served Twice as Peru's President</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Peruvian President Fernando Belaunde, who was hustled out of
office by generals in 1968 and returned to power by a massive
majority in elections 12 years later, died Tuesday. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Andres Garcia, Belaunde's nephew, said the former president
died of complications from a stroke at a Lima hospital.</LD>
<LD>   A veteran of more than half a century in politics, Belaunde was
regarded as a patriarch of democracy in Latin America. He had a
reputation for personal honesty that made him an exception to the
rule among Peruvian political leaders.</LD>
<TE>   First elected president in 1963, Belaunde was overthrown and
exiled in 1968 by Gen. Juan Velasco, who ushered in 12 years of
military rule.</TE>
<TE>   During his 10 years in exile, Belaunde worked as a college
professor, teaching at Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hopkins and George
Washington universities. The experience left him with great
admiration for U.S. democracy.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Peru to win the 1980 presidential election in a
landslide, marking the restoration of democratic rule.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Lima on Oct. 7, 1912, Belaunde spent his early years in
Paris and the United States after his well-to-do and politically
active father was sent into political exile in 1924. He went on to
study architecture at the University of Miami and the University of
Texas, from which he graduated in 1935.</TE>
<TE>   He helped to found the National Democratic Front in 1943 and in
1956 started the centrist Popular Action party, which he led until
his death.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Chamber of Deputies for one term from 1945 to
1948 and ran unsuccessfully for president twice. President Manuel
Prado, his political foe, confined him in 1959 to an island prison,
from which he tried to escape by swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Belaunde was succeeded as president by Alan Garcia in 1985, the
first time in more than 40 years that one democratically elected
Peruvian president handed power to another.</TE>
<TE>   During his two administrations, Belaunde built important highways
and major hydroelectric dams and brought electricity to thousands of
towns. He also constructed many housing projects in Lima and other
cities. But by the end of his second term, Peru faced severe debt and
a new urban and rural armed struggle led by the Maoist Shining Path
(Sendero Luminoso).</TE>
<TE>   Belaunde wrote several books, among them "The Conquest of Peru by
Peruvians," which laid out his vision of the country and how it
should be developed.</TE>
<TE>   He supported the failed 1990 presidential campaign of his close
friend, famed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who was beaten by an
unknown university rector, Alberto Fujimori.</TE>
<TE>   Belaunde condemned Fujimori's 1992 "self-coup," in which he
suspended the constitution and dissolved Congress and the Supreme
Court with military backing.</TE>
<TE>   Belaunde is survived by three children from his first marriage.</TE>

<LD>Assemblyman Bob Hertz- berg (D-Sherman Oaks) is close to completion
on a detailed plan to divide Los Angeles into nine boroughs, the
former Assembly speaker and others said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Hertzberg, who carried legislation to make secession possible,
said his borough plan, when finished, will be better than breaking up
the city.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm trying to change the governance structure of Los Angeles," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel said Hertzberg's plan
may be melded into her proposal for a borough system.</TE>
<TE>   At a public hearing Tuesday night in North Hollywood, about 100
people turned out to discuss the idea of boroughs for Los Angeles
before a City Council subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hendrickson, 59, a lifetime North Hollywood resident,
dismissed the borough plans as a tactic to block secession efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's too little too late," Hendrickson said. "They are
only offering this stuff to change our votes on secession."</TE>
<TE>   But Theresa Newham of the Mid-Valley Neighborhood Council said she
opposes Valley secession. "I'm really afraid that if we secede, we'll
be trading the devil for his mama."</TE>

<HD>Data Reflect Southland's Highs, Lows</HD>
<DH>People: Poverty and education levels reflect immigration
patterns, demographer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California has the highest percentage of poor families and
poorly educated residents among the nation's large metropolitan
areas, according to data released Tuesday by the Census Bureau.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County area has the highest
percentage of residents with less than a ninth-grade education, the
lowest percentage of those who have completed high school and the
highest percentage of families in poverty.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of the Greater Los Angeles area also use more of their
income to pay for housing than those in most other metropolitan
areas, and are among the most likely to speak a language other than
English at home.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday marked the first time the government released nationwide
totals from the Census 2000 "long form," a survey distributed to 20
million households covering topics from income to education to
commuting.</TE>
<TE>   State-by-state data had been released earlier this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' rankings further confirmed the impact of immigration,
said USC demographer Dowell Myers, an expert in census analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is skewed because we draw so heavily from Mexico and
Central America," and immigrants from those countries often have low
levels of schooling, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Myers said the bleak statistics may not reflect the reality for
native-born or better educated Southern Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "Because there's a high percentage of poor, does that mean you'll
become poor if you move to L.A.? No. Does it mean we're doing a bad
job at education? Not if people moved here after they've finished
their education.... Does it mean the economy is not performing well?
No. If someone comes here with less than a ninth-grade education,
they're almost doomed to a life of poverty," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area tied Miami as the region with the highest
percentage of Latinos, at 40.3%. The San Francisco area was the only
metropolitan area with a larger share of Asian American residents, at
18.4% compared with Los Angeles' 10.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's white and African American populations were
proportionately among the smallest of the large metropolitan areas.</TE>
<TE>   Whites made up 39% of the Los Angeles area population; it was the
second-smallest percentage among the 14 metropolitan areas with 3
million or more residents. African Americans represented 7.6% of the
area's residents, the 10th-highest percentage among the 14 metro
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles had the second-highest percentage of foreign-born
residents (30.9%), behind Miami and ahead of San Francisco, New York
and Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Myers said different immigration patterns account for San
Francisco and New York having large foreign-born populations but
lower poverty and higher education levels than Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco has a higher proportion of Asian immigrants, and New
York receives many African, West Indian and European immigrants who
tend to have higher education levels than those from Mexico and
Central America, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The newly released census data also showed that Los Angeles area
residents might have some surprising advantages over those in other
big cities.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Los Angeles area's rush hour traffic, mean travel time
to work is longer in New York, Washington, Atlanta, Chicago and San
Francisco than the 29.1 minutes it takes the average Angeleno to get
from home to job.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area ranks eighth in the percentage of residents
who use public transportation to get to work.</TE>
<TE>   Some highlights from national data released Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * The percentage of Americans living below poverty level decreased
slightly from 13.1% in 1989 to 12.4% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   (In the Los Angeles area, individuals below the poverty level
increased, from 13.1% to 15.6%. By another measure--the proportion of
families below the poverty level--Los Angeles had the worst total
among large metropolitan areas.)</TE>
<TE>   The poverty level differs according to a household's makeup.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in 1999, the poverty threshold for a family of four
with three children was $16,954.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, that threshold for a three-person household with
one child was $13,410.</TE>
<TE>   * Americans' median household income went up from an
inflation-adjusted $39,008 to $41,994 during the decade. In the L.A.
area, it fell from $47,646 to $45,903.</TE>
<TE>   * The average one-way commuting time increased by three minutes to
nearly 26 minutes. More people drove to work alone, and fewer people
carpooled or took public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   * Nearly one in four Americans age 25 and older have at least a
college education, up from one in five in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area is close to the national average--24.4% have
at least a bachelor's degree--but that ranks the area only 12th out
of the 14 large metropolitan areas.</TE>
<TE>   John Logan, a sociologist at the State University of New York at
Albany, said Midwest metropolitan areas benefited from the 1990s
expansion more than Southern California and the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   For example, metropolitan areas such as Detroit made big gains,
although the city still suffers from high poverty and unemployment,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose was the most prosperous metropolitan area, Logan found.
It was followed by Nassau and Suffolk counties in New York, home to
New York City suburbs, and the Washington, D.C., area--mainly because
of gains in outlying communities rather than Washington itself.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area tied metropolitan Atlanta for sixth place in
the percentage of households with incomes over $200,000, with 3.4% of
households.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have said part of the reason for poverty increases in
urban areas may be because much job growth over the decade came in
lower-paying positions. For many people, that wasn't enough to keep
up with rising costs of housing and child care.</TE>

<DH>Mobile classrooms are helping keep teenagers who have

<LD>It's before 8 a.m. and Larry Keegan, dressed in shorts and tennis
shoes, drives into the parking lot of a dusty Santa Paula strip mall.
He swings open the side door of the paint-peeled motor home.</LD>
<LD>   And class is in session.</LD>
<LD>   The teacher waits as, one by one, his students file in. They are
teenage mothers, former gangbangers and other would-be dropouts who
are getting one last chance at a high school diploma.</LD>
<TE>   "It's way better than regular school," gushes student Alexandria
Ramirez, who has been in and out of Juvenile Hall since she was 14.
"Everyone has an opportunity here--it's just taking it."</TE>
<TE>   The mobile classroom is part of Ventura County's Gateway School
program, which aims to recapture kids who have fallen behind in
classes or been expelled from mainstream middle and high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a Different</TE>
<TE>   Approach to School</TE>
<TE>   It reflects a growing effort by educators throughout Southern
California to bring these alternative school programs to the
communities that need them most. Whether they are in storefronts,
churches or vehicles, the schools are attracting teenagers who might
otherwise be out on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than letting them drop out, we reach out, and serve them
in the environment in which they're most comfortable," said Karen
Medeiros, director of curriculum for alternative education in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where they can be the most successful."</TE>
<TE>   In the satellite program that began in Santa Paula about 15 months
ago, teachers believe the approach is working.</TE>
<TE>   Keegan's students are on independent study, which means they
complete assignments at their own pace. For one reason or another,
they couldn't survive either academically or socially at the town's
comprehensive school, Santa Paula High.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandria, 17, said the tension with some other girls at the high
school was so bad, she couldn't walk across campus without getting in
fights.</TE>
<TE>   C.B. Vasquez, 17, was lost in many of his classes and said his
teachers were always too busy to help.</TE>
<TE>   Now, they come to the motor home for 90 minutes twice a week,
where they turn in work, meet with the teacher and update the weekly
"contracts" that spell out their next list of assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry goes through everything with me, and it really helps," said
C.B., who hopes to earn his diploma next year and join the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandria said being with Keegan in the mobile school has taught
her how to control her impulses to fight.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, it's a nicer atmosphere, and everyone knows each other,"
she said. "I've learned it's all about the way you present yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Keegan's 1992 Chevy Chaparral, which Ventura County leases for $1
a year from an Orange County program, is a converted classroom with
eight workstations.</TE>
<TE>   At four makeshift desks that face windows, there is space for two
students each. Lawn chairs are stashed behind the seats in case more
show up.</TE>
<TE>   There is no bathroom, but students use nearby public restrooms
available at each of Keegan's three daily stops, which include a
sheriff's substation, a library and the shopping center parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   With oldies radio humming in the background, students hunch over
workbooks as Keegan sits facing them in the passenger seat,
monitoring their behavior and grading their assignments. Every couple
of minutes, one of them has a question for him.</TE>
<TE>   His route, which is about 12 miles a day, begins at 8 a.m. and
ends at 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just worked great up here," Keegan said. "It's perfect for
the environment we're in."</TE>
<TE>   The motor home is one aspect of the satellite, which also includes
a daily classroom run by teacher Judy Dobbins out of a Baptist
church. That program also includes a day care center for teenage
mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Students are moved around between the two venues to meet their
specific needs, Keegan said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten Santa Paula teenagers will graduate from the community school
on June 13, among them 16-year-old Candace Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   She said she never got the attention she needed in mainstream high
school.</TE>
<TE>   She will be the first person on either side of her family to earn
a high school diploma and plans to continue her education at Ventura
Community College in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably would've dropped out a long time ago," she said.
"There's no way I would've made it there."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, a working-class farm town where juvenile crime
rates are among the highest in the county, the service was needed,
Keegan said.</TE>
<TE>   He taught in Ventura County court schools for 10 years before
volunteering to create Gateway's first satellite school in Ventura in
1989.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has helped create seven more, from Ojai to Simi
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, Gateway students had to travel to the main school
site in Camarillo, which was very difficult for teenagers in places
like Santa Paula, which is 30 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "We were asking kids who have had major problems with attendance
and truancy to get on a bus for 45 minutes to go to school," he said.
"Since we have located ourselves in the community, we have seen a lot
more success."</TE>
<TE>   Programs Face Cuts</TE>
<TE>   in State Funding</TE>
<TE>   But the programs also face some serious challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis' state budget initially included proposals to
slash independent study by 10% and to cut the higher revenue that
county-run schools get to educate kids who are on probation.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, programs in Ventura, Orange and Los Angeles
counties have seen rapid growth in the last five years and still need
to expand, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The programs are held to the same standards as other schools,
including the requirement that all students pass the California High
School Exit Exam beginning in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Keegan admits he is worried about the effect that the test will
have on the numbers of students the county programs will be able to
graduate.</TE>
<TE>   But he and Dobbins say that they have no intention of giving up.
They will continue to push things like volunteer job training and
vocational programs to show even the most discouraged kids they have
a chance at a better life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see everyone make it," Keegan said.</TE>
<TE>   At 10 a.m., it's time for his next set of students. Climbing back
into the driver's seat, he takes his classroom with him.</TE>

<LD>A 17-year-old girl who was preparing to graduate this week from
Paraclete High School in Lancaster died Tuesday after her car swerved
off the Antelope Valley Freeway and crashed into an embankment,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Emily Hofmeister, whose graduation was scheduled for Friday, was
alone in a 1991 Lexus and driving north on the freeway at "a high
rate of speed" when the crash occurred, according to the California

<LD>   Hofmeister had passed a tractor-trailer and as she pulled ahead of
the truck her car veered far to the right, authorities said. It hit a
guardrail and went off the freeway, landing upside-down on the
embankment near Avenue P-8, CHP Officer John Seumanutafa said.</LD>
<TE>   Hofmeister, of Quartz Hill, was pronounced dead at the scene at
12:17 a.m. by county paramedics, said David Campbell of the Los
Angeles County coroner's office. She was not wearing a seat belt,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Harold Hofmeister, said she had gone to her
boyfriend's house in Lancaster to take his sister to a Little League
game. She had promised to be home by 11 p.m., said Hofmeister, a
Lancaster fire captain.</TE>
<TE>   When his daughter failed to return home, Hofmeister said he called
the boyfriend, who said she was headed home. Hofmeister said he drove
the route he knew his daughter would have taken and stopped when he
saw an ambulance and fire engine.</TE>
<TE>   "They said she had passed away," Hofmeister said of the rescue
workers, some of whom he knew. "She was an outgoing person who wanted
to experience life."</TE>
<TE>   The family said Emily Hofmeister was driving her mother's Lexus
instead of her own pickup because her mother thought it was safer.</TE>
<TE>   Hofmeister was planning to study business at San Francisco State
University, her family said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Hofmeister's senior photo was displayed inside the
chapel at Paraclete High, a Catholic school, and friends and teachers
wore pink ribbons in her memory--pink was her favorite color.</TE>
<TE>   "When she walked in, she just brightened up the room," said
16-year-old Maggie Courtney, a junior and fellow cheerleader. "I'm
going to miss her so much."</TE>
<TE>   "She always had a smile on her face," said Kelsey Vincent, a
17-year-old senior and close friend. Kelsey said her friend was a
bright and beautiful girl. "It hasn't hit me yet."</TE>
<TE>   Father Joseph Scalco, the school's spiritual director and
Hofmeister's French teacher, described her as "an all-American girl."</TE>
<TE>   She was an honor roll student who "never gave any attitude to
anyone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you didn't know her, then you actually missed out on someone
special," English teacher Stephanie Kirkwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Another friend, Tiffany Brouwer, 18, said she, Hofmeister and
several friends had dressed up for Halloween as the Pink Ladies from
the movie "Grease."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in a zone right now. It's unreal," said Brouwer, who
remembered how Hofmeister liked to joke during cheerleading practice.
Hofmeister was the group's therapist, Brouwer said, always ready with
sound advice.</TE>

<HD>Hazardous Waste Site to Be Closed by State</HD>
<DH>Safety: Rialto yard with a record of violations has failed
to do promised cleanup, officials say. The EPA is called in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Rialto hazardous waste yard with such a poor maintenance record
that it once spontaneously combusted will be closed, state officials
said Tuesday as they called in the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to clean up the site.</LD>
<LD>   The company, Denova Environmental Inc., located in the elbow
formed by Interstates 10 and 15 west of San Bernardino, has rankled
residents for years.</LD>
<LD>   Some say they often had to close their windows because of the
stench that wafted from the 20-acre facility. Last year, canisters of
chemicals and hazardous waste suddenly ignited, causing a brief fire
and prompting firefighters to develop contingency plans for
evacuating a large portion of the city.</LD>
<TE>   Then, in March, state officials entered into a controversial
agreement with Denova that allowed it to remain open and offered a
legal maneuver that would permit the company to avoid a $2.5-million
fine. Critics said the agreement was typical of slipshod
environmental oversight in the Inland Empire, where a population boom
is being fed in part by enormous growth in industrial operations.</TE>
<TE>   But state environmental officials said Tuesday that they learned
that Denova has violated the terms of that March agreement by failing
to clean up the waste on the site. The state has now taken steps to
shut down the site altogether and will attempt to get the
$2.5-million fine paid, said Jeanne Garcia, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Toxic Substances Control.</TE>
<TE>   "They did not comply," Garcia said. "So it voids everything."</TE>
<TE>   Denova's attorney could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the state's move to shut down Denova, it has also
called in the EPA to remove toxic waste from the site, officials
said. Emergency crews descended on the site Tuesday morning and,
after donning protective white suits, began sorting through the
waste.</TE>
<TE>   The crews will be there for two to three weeks and, eventually,
all of the waste will be removed, said EPA spokeswoman Lisa Fasano.</TE>
<TE>   First, however, comes a more daunting task: figuring out what is
inside thousands of chemical bins.</TE>
<TE>   So far, crews have learned that Denova was essentially divided
into two businesses--one that stored hazardous waste and another that
stored explosive waste, said Steve Calanog, the EPA's on-scene
coordinator at Denova.</TE>
<TE>   On the hazardous waste side of the compound, Calanog said,
investigators have found 750 containers full of laboratory chemicals,
industrial compounds and medical waste.</TE>
<TE>   On the explosive side were rocket fuel, shells, mortars,
detonators and other ordnance.</TE>
<TE>   Denova was the last private company left in California licensed to
handle many types of explosive waste, and it was a repository of
sorts for law enforcement agencies and government contractors. The
Tempe, Ariz., Police Department, for example, stored 1,000 pounds of
small-arms ammunition there, Calanog said. Other law enforcement
agencies used Denova to store chemicals seized during raids on
methamphetamine labs.</TE>
<TE>   Not only were the materials stored improperly, Calanog said, but
the site had been effectively abandoned, meaning there was no
security.</TE>
<TE>   "You have explosive, unmanaged, highly sensitive waste that
presented imminent threats," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that any police or governmental agency, or
any hospital, knew when it handed toxic waste to Denova that the
material would not be disposed of correctly, Fasano said.</TE>
<TE>   The company had argued that government contractors and law
enforcement agencies that had counted on Denova to cope with excess
waste will now have to ship that waste out of state, incurring higher
costs in many instances.</TE>

<HD>DWP Defies City, Votes for PR Pact</HD>
<DH>Spending: Board approval of $2.4-million contract sparks a
council effort to shoot it down. Controller calls the agency
'dysfunctional.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and JEFFREY RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defying Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and the city's top financial
officer, Department of Water and Power commissioners unanimously
approved a $2.4-million public relations contract Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   However, City Councilman Jack Weiss said he plans to introduce a
motion today that would overturn the decision.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard to fathom why PR for a public entity is so important
that millions of dollars have to be committed before public watchdogs
have an opportunity to examine the books," Weiss said.</LD>
<TE>   "Good PR for DWP in this instance would clearly have been to
wait," he said. "Since they didn't wait, we have to act."</TE>
<TE>   Under the contract, the DWP would hire Lee Andrews Group Inc. to
promote DWP's Green LA program, which encourages its customers to
select environmentally friendly energy sources such as wind and
hydroelectric power. The contract, which runs through May 31, 2003,
includes an optional one-year, $2.4-million extension.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Controller Laura Chick, who has previously mocked
the agency as the "Department of Wasteful Practices," had asked DWP
commissioners to delay acting on the contract until she completed an
audit of the $60-million public benefits program, which includes
media relations for Green LA. The audit is scheduled to be finished
next month.</TE>
<TE>   After the commission's 3-0 vote on Tuesday, Chick called the
agency "dysfunctional" and urged city leaders to kill the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "In the name of good government and common sense, I ask the City
Council to vote to veto this multimillion-dollar PR contract," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slap in the face to the taxpayers and ratepayers," Chick
said. "The commission is saying, 'We don't care how the program has
been going. We don't care about an outside objective audit. We'll do
what we want and we'll go ahead ... without really looking at it.'"</TE>
<TE>   It would take a two-thirds vote of the 15-member council to take
up Weiss' motion and another two-thirds vote to veto the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hahn also had pressed DWP board President Kenneth T. Lombard
to put off a vote on the matter until the audit is completed.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Lombard led the effort to get the contract approved. He
was among black leaders who were fiercely critical of Hahn's
opposition to ousted LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Wong, a Hahn spokeswoman, noted that the contract was
downsized from its original version--a two-year agreement with a
one-year optional extension.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, the mayor accepts the commission's revised
proposal, as long as they revisit it after the audit comes out," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach DWP and Lee Andrews Group officials late Tuesday
were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   However, earlier in the day, DWP spokesman Walter Zeisl said the
public relations firm will help the agency by creating "worthwhile,
cost-effective marketing and community programs."</TE>
<TE>   "We think they do a very good job for us," he said. "Without this,
we would be severely crippled."</TE>

<HD>Pledge May Help Irvine's Effort to Annex El Toro</HD>
<DH>Land use: City won't form a redevelopment agency till after
land is sold, a promise aimed at keeping Supervisor Coad's support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine has pledged to delay creating a redevelopment agency for the
former El Toro Marine base until after the land is sold to private
developers, a move that would increase the property's value on Orange
County tax rolls and feed a trust fund that could be used for parks
elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad is supporting
Irvine's annexation of 3,700 acres of El Toro, rezoned by voters in
March from an airport to a park and limited development.</LD>
<LD>   Coad's vote is contingent, however, on the city's promise to find
$800,000 a year from the development of El Toro to finance parks in
north Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   In a plan delivered Tuesday morning to Coad, Irvine City Manager
Allison Hart said the only way to guarantee money for parks is
through property taxes paid by future private owners of El Toro land.
The base's current owner, the Navy, is exempt from property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors agreed in April--on Coad's swing vote--to let Irvine
annex the base, with the county to get 82% of the property taxes it
would have received had the property been developed under its
jurisdiction. When Irvine forms a redevelopment agency, however, the
county's share of taxes would be frozen and the agency would receive
most tax growth.</TE>
<TE>   Under state redevelopment law, the county could keep only 25% of
its share of future tax revenue once a redevelopment agency is
formed--far less than the $800,000 a year Coad has demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Coad said she wants Irvine to present a legally binding plan for
providing North County park money to supervisors by June 25 or she
will rescind her vote allowing annexation. That would create a
roadblock for Irvine's plans to take control of the base, because the
annexation needs county approval.</TE>
<TE>   "MCAS El Toro is federal property and its sale should benefit all
of Orange County," Coad said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Sale proceeds should "not just overwhelmingly accrue to residents
in South County, who already have approximately 40 times the amount
of parks and open space as in the north," she said.</TE>
<TE>   County officials couldn't say what El Toro is worth because the
land isn't taxed. Officials declined to say how much assessed value
would be needed from El Toro to reach Coad's goal of $800,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   But based on the county's average tax rate, its share of total
taxes and the percentage that would go to the county under the
tax-sharing agreement approved in April, an assessed value of $1.5
billion for the El Toro land would generate $738,000 a year in
property taxes for the county.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's plan calls for developing about 1,800 acres of the
4,700-acre base.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 acres already have been set aside for a wildlife
refuge.</TE>
<TE>   The most valuable land is the 440 acres at the base's southern
tip, where the city proposes allowing 1,500 homes,
research-and-development businesses, and the expansion of the Irvine
Auto Center.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the property is envisioned as a satellite campus of
Cal State Fullerton and other institutional users.</TE>
<TE>   However, if government entities, including the university, buy the
property, they are exempt from paying property taxes.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Try to Tame 5 Wildfires</HD>
<DH>Weather: Forecasts of heat and low humidity are bad news
for crews. Near Ojai, largest blaze is still out of control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forecasts of soaring temperatures and plunging humidity posed new
problems for firefighters Tuesday as they battled five wildfires that
had blackened more than 10,000 acres in Ventura, Los Angeles and San
Bernardino counties.</LD>
<LD>   The largest of the fires, north of Ojai, continued to burn out of
control Tuesday night after charring more than 7,500 acres of brush
and timber and destroying four unoccupied ranch buildings. The four
smaller blazes burned near Azusa, Lake Arrowhead, Castaic Lake and
Val Verde.</LD>
<LD>   "The weather isn't looking good for the next couple of days," Joe
Pasinato, a U.S. Forest Service fire information officer, said as he
eyed forecasts of temperatures from the mid-90s to considerably more
than 100 in the burning areas today.</LD>
<TE>   Tim McClung, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said the
lack of rain this winter and spring is contributing to one of the
earliest fire seasons in decades.</TE>
<TE>   "The ground is dry and the brush is dry," he said. "Over the next
few days, the air will be dry too. And it'll be hot, which helps
fires burn and is hard on the firefighters."</TE>
<TE>   An elite firefighting team arrived Tuesday to join the battle
against the Ojai blaze, which burned in rugged mountain terrain north
of town. The crews, specially trained in high-mountain brush fires,
were deployed throughout the day, while water-dropping helicopters
and tanker planes continued their air assault on the swift-moving
fire.</TE>
<TE>   But despite their efforts, the Wolf fire continued to burn out of
control across a swath of the Los Padres National Forest just east of
California 33 and south of Lockwood Valley Road. The 4-day-old fire
clouded skies and sent ash raining down on much of Ventura County. By
nightfall, the blaze was only 15% contained.</TE>
<TE>   From highway turnouts, fire crews on break watched as the blaze
erupted into five separate fronts Tuesday afternoon, with flames
moving east along hillsides in the Sespe Wilderness about 12 miles
from the California Condor Sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire terrain has been very difficult," said Jim Smith,
division chief for Los Padres National Forest. "We're not going to be
putting people out in front of the flames."</TE>
<TE>   The 44 firefighters in the special unit came from state and local
agencies and have received training in how to battle large-scale
wildfires in dangerous terrain, officials said. The unit is part of a
larger national wildfire planning team based in Boise, Idaho, said
Kris Fister, a spokeswoman for the team. Members are on call
throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze started Saturday near the Wolf Grill Restaurant off
California 33 about 12 miles north of Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the massive deployment, no one has been injured fighting
the blaze, which has strewn ashes as far east as Thousand Oaks and
cast a thick blanket of brown and orange smoke across much of the
Ventura County sky.</TE>
<TE>   A fire that began Friday near Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino
National Forest was about 90% contained Tuesday night after burning
more than 2,700 acres and destroying two commercial buildings, four
storage sheds and a trailer. Officials said that because of the
steep, mountainous terrain, low humidity and high temperatures, it
could be Friday before the blaze is fully contained.</TE>
<TE>   A brush fire that erupted about 2:45 p.m. Monday in the Angeles
National Forest about 15 miles north of Azusa had burned about 125
acres in Susana Canyon by Tuesday night. The Forest Service said the
fire, which was largely contained, apparently was started by a
campfire.</TE>
<TE>   Two blazes broke out Tuesday afternoon near Castaic and spread
rapidly through dry brush.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 Los Angeles County firefighters and air tankers were
deployed to fight the first, which was reported about 4:45 p.m.
between Castaic Lake and the Golden State Freeway. Ground crews and
planes also moved in to battle the second, which broke out near Val
Verde Park, about five miles southwest of the other fire. Officials
said brisk breezes were blowing in the area. Arson investigators were
looking into the cause of the blazes, a standard practice, officials
said. The two fires, which together burned 130 acres, were contained
by 10 p.m. Tuesday, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Another blaze was reported about 10:15 p.m. Tuesday in the Kagel
Canyon area, but was out in about 40 minutes. Kagel Canyon runs into
the mountains from the northeast San Fernando Valley, near Lake View
Terrace.</TE>
<TE>   McClung said the breezes, heat and low humidity are products of a
giant, high-pressure weather system that edged into Northern and
Central California on Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The weather service predicted a record-breaking high of 100
degrees in Pasadena today. The existing record for a June 5 in
Pasadena is 95, set in 1930.</TE>

<CX>   Los Padres wildfire--A caption with a story that ran in the
California section June 5 on a wildfire in the Los Padres National
Forest referred to a firefighter swinging a thermometer to calculate
the humidity. What he was actually using was a psychrometer, a
combination of two types of thermometer whose readings together can
be used to calculate humidity.</CX>

<HD>Murray Fisher, 69; Shaped Playboy Interview Feature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Hugh M. Hefner walked into his new Playboy magazine office in
Chicago in 1962, ordering the creation of an in-depth interview
feature, he suggested that staff members take a look at leftover
celebrity stories meant for the glossy publication Show Business
Illustrated that he had just folded.</LD>
<LD>   The task fell to a young associate editor named Murray Fisher who,
rummaging among the inventory, found an unfinished piece by the
unknown writer Alex Haley on jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. Intrigued by
Davis' raging commentary about being black in white America, Fisher
urged Haley to spend more time with the musician.</LD>
<LD>   The result, published in September 1962, was the first Playboy
Interview, a feature that became one of the magazine's most popular
attractions and over the decades has elicited remarks that made
headlines.</LD>
<TE>   Murray Fisher, who edited that first Playboy Interview by Haley
and all the monthly versions that followed until he left the magazine
to help Haley complete his autobiographical saga "Roots," has died.
He was 69.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher died Friday in Santa Monica after suffering from
Alzheimer's disease and a series of strokes, said his wife, Sara.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Weyr, who examined the development of Playboy in the book
"Reaching for Paradise," wrote that Fisher "made the Playboy
Interview a form of literary expression that neither the looser
models--from the Paris Review to Redbook--nor the television version
ever matched."</TE>
<TE>   "The Davis interview would prove a Playboy benchmark, and not only
because of the searing discussion of race it presented," Weyr wrote.
"It marked the beginning of the Playboy Interview, which has become
one of the most vibrant and important public-opinion forums in the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years after he helped launch the feature, Fisher described
the in-depth Playboy Interview for the New York Times as equal parts
psychoanalysis and jury trial, with the interviewer reserving the
right to cross-examine.</TE>
<TE>   "Celebrities are used to being interviewed," he said then. "They
have a ready-made set of answers to questions they've been asked
before. So you ask those, but then you don't leave. You let them
exhaust their repertory of defense mechanisms, and after three or
four hours you're down to bedrock. That's when it gets interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Befriending Haley as he emerged from 20 years in the Coast Guard
to begin a writing career in his 40s, Fisher edited several of his
interviews and then left Playboy and Chicago in 1974, moving to Los
Angeles to help Haley edit his epic. Haley thanked him in the
acknowledgments to "Roots" when it was published in 1976:</TE>
<TE>   "Murray Fisher had been my editor for years at Playboy magazine
when I solicited his clinical expertise to help me structure this
book from a seeming impassable maze of researched materials. After we
had established 'Roots'' pattern of chapters, next the story line was
developed, which he then shepherded throughout.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, in the book's pressurized completion phase, he even
drafted some of 'Roots'' scenes, and his brilliant editing pen
steadily tightened the book's great length."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher was such an excellent editor that some Haley critics later
claimed that Fisher actually wrote the book. Fisher vehemently denied
any personal authorship, and said his efforts on Haley's behalf were
nothing more than normal editing. He praised Haley's writing in his
introduction to the 528-page book Fisher edited, "Alex Haley: The
Playboy Interviews."</TE>
<TE>   In that book, Fisher rated Haley's question-and-answer articles
"among the best ever printed" and noted that Haley's last interview,
"Malcolm X Remembered" published in July 1992, was delivered
"letter-perfect and on time."</TE>
<TE>   "It was very important to Murray that his role in the creation of
'Roots' remain in the background," said Larry DuBois, who did Playboy
interviews for Fisher on Robert Redford and Roman Polanski, among
others, and later worked with the editor at Medallion Books in Los
Angeles. "He loved Alex Haley and what 'Roots' meant to blacks in
America. He wanted all the credit to go to Alex."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, who had assigned Haley to do a 1963 Playboy Interview with
Malcolm X, also edited Haley's efforts on "The Autobiography of
Malcolm X," which grew out of the interview.</TE>
<TE>   As Fisher related in the book of Haley's Playboy Interviews,
Malcolm X originally chastised Haley for permitting Fisher to
"censor" the book. He changed his mind after Haley had him read
Fisher's editing notes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not trying to water it down. He's trying to make it better,"
Malcolm X told Haley with surprise. Later, just before his
assassination and the book's publication in 1965, the activist wrote
to Fisher, saying: "The friendship of people like yourself gives me
hope that black and white can learn to live in peace."</TE>
<TE>   Born in China to American missionaries, Fisher grew up in
post-World War II Tokyo, where his father was working for Reader's
Digest. Fisher became a war correspondent in South Korea, then worked
for NBC in the 1950s before joining Hefner's neophyte Playboy.</TE>
<TE>   It was as an editor, rather than as a writer, that Fisher built
his quiet reputation. When he edited Playboy Interviews in their
formative years from 1962 to 1974, according to his successor,
Playboy Executive Editor G. Barry Golson, in his 1981 book "The
Playboy Interview," Fisher imposed the rigorous standards that would
make the feature a literary phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher first assigned an interviewing journalist to submit several
hundred written questions, which Fisher would discuss with him and
edit. Under Fisher's direction, the interviewer would spend another
month researching the subject's background and talking to those who
knew him.</TE>
<TE>   Then Fisher sent the journalist to do the interview--which could
occur over several sessions and produce from six to 20 or more hours
of taped conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher's technique, changing the interview from ear-friendly to
eye-friendly for the page, was, as Golson described it, to sift and
refine the endless taped verbiage into a continuous, linear and
always fascinating conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation required considerable editing
skills--condensing, rearranging, squeezing out repetitions,
meanderings and pauses, yet keeping the result true to the subject's
conversational pattern and statements.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher's standards calling for hundreds of questions and hours of
talk, coupled with his admonition "but then you don't leave,"
produced Playboy's first coup in 1963 when he assigned Norman
MacKenzie to interview Bertrand Russell. They expected to hear the
Nobel-winning mathematician, philosopher and pacifist's views on
disarmament, and criticism of the U.S.-Soviet arms race.</TE>
<TE>   "But as it turned out, Lord Russell had some unconventional views
on other matters, too, calling for a new outlook on sexuality, for a
revamping of sexual education, for a new and open morality--topics
congenial to Playboy but not often articulated by such a respectable
spokesman," wrote Golson in introducing the interview in his book.
"It was Fisher's--and Playboy's--first real coup."</TE>
<TE>   DuBois, who called Fisher "a main force in making Playboy a
literary effort" from its inception, said Fisher also started the
magazine's "Sex and the Cinema" column and worked to develop such
writers as humorist Jean Shepherd.</TE>
<TE>   After Fisher left the magazine in 1974, he kept a close
relationship with the staff and with Hefner, DuBois said, and in the
1990s helped Hefner work on an autobiography that was never finished.</TE>
<TE>   As an editor, Fisher worked with Medallion Books and, until
illness intervened a few years ago, as editorial director of General
Publishing Group, which has published such books as "Playboy: 40
Years" and "In the Kitchen with Rosie" by Oprah Winfrey's cook, Rosie
Daley.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher is survived by his wife of 14 years, Sara; and two children
from a previous marriage, Suzanne Fisher of Aspen, Colo., and Garrett
Fisher of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be private.</TE>

<HD>Trial Starts for Man Accused of Killing Girl, 7</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutors say evidence, child porn tie David
Westerfield to Danielle van Dam's murder. Defense focuses on her
parents' lifestyle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Forensic evidence and child pornography link David Westerfield to the
kidnapping and murder of Danielle van Dam, the lead prosecutor told
jurors Tuesday, while a defense attorney sought to portray the
7-year-old's parents as liars who tried to mislead police to cover up
their drug use and permissive sexual practices.</LD>
<LD>   In his opening statement in Superior Court, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Jeff Dusek said that Danielle's blood and hair were found inside
Westerfield's recreational vehicle, along with carpet fibers from the
Van Dam home. Some of the hair still had roots, suggesting a
struggle, Dusek said.</LD>
<LD>   But defense attorney Steven Feldman said there is no evidence that
Westerfield was inside the Van Dam home, which is two doors from his
own house in the upscale community of Sabre Springs.</LD>
<TE>   He suggested that the blood, hair and fibers may have been left
behind when Danielle and her mother, Brenda van Dam, came to
Westerfield's home selling Girl Scout cookies in the days before
Danielle disappeared Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed engineer, faces the death penalty
if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested Feb. 22, five days before Danielle's nude and
decomposed body was found in a rural area 40 miles from her home.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek gave a protracted description, in graphic detail, of child
pornography he said was found in Westerfield's home.</TE>
<TE>   But Feldman said he will present evidence that Westerfield is
sexually attracted to adult women, not children.</TE>
<TE>   Early in Feldman's highly animated statement, Judge William Mudd
interrupted to instruct jurors, "This is not evidence, ladies and
gentlemen. This is argument."</TE>
<TE>   Snapping his fingers, Feldman described the Van Dams sarcastically
as "just like any other family."</TE>
<TE>   He went on to describe how the couple smoked marijuana at home and
indulged in extramarital sex.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said the Van Dams' lifestyle allowed many strangers to
come into the home.</TE>
<TE>   The night Danielle disappeared, he said, Brenda van Dam was at a
local restaurant-bar dancing, smoking marijuana, drinking, "flirting"
and asking numerous men if they would like to return to her home.</TE>
<TE>   While his wife was at the restaurant-bar, Damon van Dam was home
with Danielle and the couple's two sons.</TE>
<TE>   At a preliminary hearing, the father testified he tucked the
children into bed at 10 p.m. and was horrified the next morning to
find Danielle missing.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Dusek said that Westerfield, rebuffed in his advances
toward two of Brenda van Dam's female friends, left the restaurant
early and then kidnapped Danielle.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek told jurors that during the trial they would learn "what he
did to Danielle van Dam, what he did with Danielle van Dam, where he
took her, and where he dumped her."</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said that while Westerfield was open and talkative with
police in the days after the disappearance, the Van Dams were not.</TE>
<TE>   "It took six interviews [by police] to get to the bottom of the
Van Dams' story," the defense attorney said. "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   Justin Brooks, a law professor at California Western School of Law
in San Diego, said that Feldman's strategy of questioning the Van
Dams' lifestyle is relevant because it brings up questions of how
many people had access to the house and might have murdered the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "While such questions might seem inflammatory, it's the legitimate
role of the defense attorney to raise questions about whether there
could be other suspects out there," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   In a week's worth of debate over pretrial motions, Dusek had
sought to limit Feldman's ability to probe the Van Dams' lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd ruled that he would allow limited examination of such issues,
but only as it relates to the night Danielle disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Dams sought to attend Tuesday's session but, as potential
witnesses, were barred by sheriff's deputies.</TE>

<HD>1 Charge Dropped Against Researcher</HD>
<DH>UC Davis: Allegation of embezzlement remains in a case
involving corneal transplants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors Tuesday dropped a charge of trade secret theft against a
UC Davis researcher who had been doing corneal transplant work in a
university lab.</LD>
<LD>   Bin Han, 40, who still faces embezzlement charges, was
subsequently released from the Yolo County jail, where he had been
held without bail since being arrested at his Davis home May 18.</LD>
<LD>   "In essence, the trade secret count [was] dismissed because the
information is not a trade secret," said Richard Allaye Chan, Han's
defense attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Han, who Chan said was fired May 13, had worked as a UC Davis
researcher since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested after campus police searched his home and found
what they described as research notes and vials of material for the
growing of cornea cells.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, UC Davis police launched an
investigation after a manager in the Davis Medical Center
Ophthalmology Department reported her concerns that Han was stealing
research ideas and apparently setting up a lab in China, from where
he had emigrated.</TE>
<TE>   Chan said in an interview that the notes police found in Han's
home were personal and of the sort any researcher would scribble,
that the vials of material in his freezer were not patented and that
work of a similar nature had been conducted elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   He also said Han was the lead author on an article describing the
research, which had been submitted to a medical journal.</TE>
<TE>   "All the research he was doing was in the public realm already,"
Chan said, adding that there was "nothing sinister" about Han's
possession of the vials, which the university says Han picked up as
part of a lab delivery from a local biotech firm.</TE>
<TE>   Yolo County Deputy Dist. Atty. David Akulian declined to comment
on the case.</TE>
<TE>   A UC Davis spokesman said the trade secret charge was dropped with
the understanding it could be refiled if additional evidence was
uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation is continuing," said university spokesman Paul
Pfotenhauer.</TE>
<TE>   "Did he have information where perhaps he could have benefited by
selling this to China? We are still investigating this issue of
intellectual property."</TE>
<TE>   Han's lab was conducting research on the growth of human corneal
cells that might be used in corneal transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Han, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was ordered to surrender his
passport during Tuesday's Superior Court hearing and was released on
his own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary hearing on the embezzlement charge is scheduled next
month.</TE>

<HD>Board OKs Suit to Block Wage Measure</HD>
<DH>County: The initiative would increase the pay of aides who
assist the elderly or infirm. Supervisors say they would lose the
power to manage budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA and GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The county Board of Supervisors will sue to block an initiative to
increase the salaries of health aides who care for the elderly and
infirm in their homes, arguing that the measure illegally interferes
with the board's ability to set its budget.</LD>
<LD>   The move was contrary to a written opinion by the county's lawyer,
who has told the supervisors that fighting an initiative before it
appears on the ballot is a difficult legal maneuver.</LD>
<LD>   The measure is due to appear on the November ballot.</LD>
<TE>   "We've known all along that there are serious constitutional
issues involved and that it totally removes the supervisors' ability
to manage our budget," said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.</TE>
<TE>   "If every employee group puts on the ballot what salary they want
... we would lose all control."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's unanimous vote was the second attempt by the board to
stop the initiative, which would increase the aides' hourly wages
from $6.75 to $11.50, costing the county about $245 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier closed-door vote to kill the measure led to a
protracted controversy about the board's secret dealings and
eventually to new policies increasing public access to county
government.</TE>
<TE>   "We would not circulate a petition if we thought it was unlawful,"
Tyrone Freeman, president of Service Employees International Union
434B, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent here is to increase the wages and the quality of care
for seniors and people with disabilities."</TE>
<TE>   The proponents have gathered enough signatures to put the measure
on November's ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their opposition to the measure, to satisfy a legal
requirement supervisors voted Tuesday to place the initiative on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But Supervisor Gloria Molina also asked the county's outside legal
advisors to testify about whether the measure was constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jones, of the O'Melveny and Myers firm, said he did not
believe that it was legal.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors then went behind closed doors to discuss whether
they should sue to block it.</TE>
<TE>   Molina said she believes that the workers deserve better pay, but
that the burden should fall on the state, not the county.</TE>
<TE>   The state saves millions of dollars on hospital stays by hiring
the aides to help dress, feed and perform other basic tasks for
low-income elderly and infirm in their homes, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The aides are paid by a mix of federal, state and county funds and
have battled with the county for years over higher wages and health
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The state has approved raises for the aides, but local governments
have to agree to pay their share for the raises to take effect.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem that some of us have is that we believe the state has
full responsibility--not partial responsibility," Molina said.</TE>
<TE>   Another concern, however, is that powerful unions will resort to
initiatives to set salaries and benefits when they are unhappy with
the county's offers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the union representing county sheriff's deputies filed an
intention Monday with the registrar-recorder to circulate a petition
for an initiative for better retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "When you set salaries by initiative, when you have benefits set
by initiative, you have the unsettling specter of having salaries set
by the voters that exceed the government's ability to pay," said
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about the home-care workers. This is about how the
county is going to govern itself and how salaries are going to be
set."</TE>
<TE>   He said that the county was willing to offer a modest raise,
bringing salaries up to $7.50 an hour, but that the union chose to
take the issue to the voters.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors have wanted to stop the initiative since the union
served notice of it in December.</TE>

<HD>UC Names Administrator to Head Livermore Nuclear Weapons
Lab</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Michael R. Anastasio gets post after security
concerns arose about earlier candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of California on Tuesday named Michael R. Anastasio, a
senior administrator at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
as the new director of the nuclear weapons facility.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to appoint Anastasio, a veteran Livermore employee
who has served recently as its deputy director of strategic
operations, came a month after the university abruptly dropped plans
to appoint another candidate.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, whose department contracts
with UC to run Livermore and two other national laboratories, raised
concerns about the earlier candidate's supervisory role at the Los
Alamos lab during the controversy surrounding lab scientist Wen Ho
Lee. Lee was once suspected of espionage at the New Mexico lab, but
was never charged with that allegation.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, UC President Richard C. Atkinson praised Anastasio,
53, as a top scientist and able administrator who will make a superb
director of the Livermore lab, which is near Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The position is among the most sensitive in the national security
bureaucracy. The appointment of Anastasio, a 22-year employee of
Livermore, comes at a particularly sensitive time, in the wake of
Sept. 11 and against the backdrop of the U.S. war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Anastasio, a theoretical nuclear physicist who is considered a
national leader in the safe stewardship of weapons, said he would
testify in Washington next week before a congressional committee
studying how to safeguard the nation's nuclear stockpile.</TE>
<TE>   But in a news conference, Anastasio also alluded to Livermore's
increasing role in counter-terrorism research, noting that the
government turned to the lab for help during the anthrax scare last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Anastasio said he was not troubled that he was not the first
choice for the job. "My focus is forward and how to lead the lab," he
said. "That's what I'm putting my energy into."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he hoped to continue building the relationships among
the nation's often competitive nuclear laboratories, especially with
Los Alamos.</TE>
<TE>   The Livermore laboratory and Los Alamos are the nation's two
largest nuclear weapons labs. UC also manages the Lawrence Berkeley
lab, which does not perform weapons work, on behalf of the U.S.
Department of Energy.</TE>
<TE>   The labs' directors are chosen by the university's president, in
consultation with the Energy secretary and approval of the
university's regents.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the university dropped plans to name Ray Juzaitis, a
senior administrator at Los Alamos, as director of Livermore amid
questions about his role in supervising Lee, once suspected of spying
for China.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who was held in solitary confinement for 275 days, ultimately
pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling restricted data and was
sentenced to time served. He denied being a spy and alleged that he
was singled out because of his Chinese ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   Juzaitis was found to have had little to do with the Lee affair
and a selection committee chose him for the Livermore job from a
field of 40 candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Abraham raised concerns about Juzaitis' personal connection
to Lee. A scheduled vote by UC regents was put off at the last minute
and Juzaitis later withdrew, a UC spokesman said.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Mayor in Lead</HD>
<DH>Election: With slightly less than half the vote counted,
incumbent Beverly O'Neill holds a comfortable margin against two
rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach residents were favoring termed-out incumbent Beverly
O'Neill for mayor in early returns Tuesday in a runoff election that
had only one name on the ballot but two write-in contenders.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill, who ran as a write-in candidate because she has already
served two terms, was leading with 48% of the votes, with 81 of 188
precincts reporting.</LD>
<LD>   Vice Mayor Dan Baker, the only name on the ballot, was in second
place with 37% of the vote and Norm Ryan, who previously authored a
winning utility tax cut proposition and ran as a write-in candidate,
was in third with 14% of vote.</LD>
<TE>   The unusual number of write-in votes slowed the ballot counting,
the Long Beach city clerk's office said. . Final unofficial results
were not expected until 3 a.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to tell you," O'Neill said. "it's too early for me to be
excited. I'm thrilled ... but I know in an election ... things can
change a lot" by the end of the night.</TE>
<TE>   In some parts of Long Beach, voters Tuesday were deciding two
other runoff contests: the 7th District City Council seat and the 5th
District seat on the Long Beach Unified School District board.</TE>
<TE>   With 17 of 50 precincts reporting, Jeannine McManigal-Ball was
leading in the school board race with 52.6% of the vote, followed by
James John Choura with 47.3% . In the 7th District council race, Mike
Donelon was leading with 55%, followed by Tonia Reyes Uranga with 45%
with only four of 23 precincts reporting.</TE>
<TE>   But the peculiar mayor's race has attracted attention even outside
this city of 461,000.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach's voter-approved term limits law precludes any elected
city official from running for a third term. But unlike most term
limits laws, the city's statute allows an incumbent to run as a
write-in candidate.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's first-place finish in the primary stunned political
observers because it is so difficult, even for a popular incumbent,
to win as a write-in. A runoff was necessary because none of the
candidates got more than 50% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, voters in Saugus approved an elementary school bond
measure in the Santa Clarita Valley city. The bond garnered 73% of
the vote in unofficial final results. . The measure needed two-thirds
approval for passage.</TE>
<TE>   The $48-million bond measure would help fund a $120-million plan
to renovate old elementary schools and build two new ones, district
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Laurie Fish said the money would provide some relief for a
13-school system that isn't overcrowded now but does rely on portable
classrooms for nearly half its learning space.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Saugus has done a good job of keeping up with the
growth, we are still growing rapidly," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In Pomona, two measures to reduce or eliminate the utility users
tax were losing in early returns.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Richard Fausse, Gariot Louimat and Hector Becerra
contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>In what might be the low point of his career, Los Angeles Mayor Jim
Hahn went to an Encino park Saturday to lead a rally against San
Fernando Valley secession, and 50 people showed up.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn had a finger in the air to chants of "One L.A.," but given
the meager assemblage, it was more a case of public loitering than a
rally.</LD>
<LD>   At this point, I think Slim Jim may be doing more harm than good,
and his handlers should consider locking him in his office the rest
of the way. Why should the Valley stick with a mayor who, in a city
of millions, can't put more than four dozen people into a park on the
most vital issue of his career?</LD>
<TE>   You bus in the sick and infirm, and even the homeless, if you have
to. But you do not, under any circumstances, show your face at a sad
little confab of 50 lonely souls.</TE>
<TE>   To tell you the truth, though, Hahn's failure of leadership in
keeping the city together may be a blessing in disguise. I was out of
town last week, and with the benefit of time and distance, secession
began to make more sense.</TE>
<TE>   Look, this is a rocky marriage. Has been for a long time. And
frankly, I'm growing weary of all the carping and moaning from
professional whiners who'd have you believe that those of us who live
south of Mulholland are picking the Valley's pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of getting slapped around all summer just to be dumped in
November, we ought to stand together, and, in unison, send a shout
over the Hollywood Hills:</TE>
<TE>   Get lost.</TE>
<TE>   That's right. You wanna start your own city? Go ahead, and good
luck. I'm sure it'll be a neat, tight little community of 1.35
million. No hacks, no boondoggles, no power grabs.</TE>
<TE>   And by the way, you can call off the campaign for a new name,
because a reader sent me a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Less Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Bon voyage.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know if I can endure five more months of listening to the
tired litany of reasons the Valley ought to secede. Here's the
promise of a nickel to the first person who can tell me why we ought
to keep it.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I know. The Valley pays its taxes. But the numbers offered
up as an argument for secession don't add up, as I read them, despite
the claims of the Proposition 13-inspired crackpots who started this
whole thing.</TE>
<TE>   The gripe is that the Valley pays roughly 5% more in taxes than
what it gets in services. But does anyone really believe you can
build a huge new city from scratch and not burn through that 5% in
about 10 minutes?</TE>
<TE>   Besides which, the rap about getting cheated on cops-per-capita is
the work of fools. In every city in America, you'll find a higher
concentration of cops in high-crime areas, keeping lawbreakers from
escaping to well-heeled environs. Every once in a while, an
enterprising marauder breaks through the blue line, sure.</TE>
<TE>   But what happened when Rodney King made the mistake of entering
the Valley? You know exactly what happened. Your tax dollars went to
work in a big way.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the gripe?</TE>
<TE>   Seriously, though, don't let math or logic get in the way of
creating a boiling, landlocked city with no Lakers and no beach,
among other things. This isn't about math, anyway, or the November
ballot measure would go down in a ball of flames. It's about the
wounded psyche of the Valley, and its enduring sense that it gets no
respect.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, the Valley has a legitimate gripe, but it's a
historical, not a current one. Real estate developers and other
robber barons, including certain newspaper tycoons, sold the Garden
of Eden to the devil, fattening their wallets on sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   The city reached beyond natural borders and available resources,
stealing water as needed and always, always laying concrete pathways
to the farthest reaches of the promised land, even as the whole mess
began to resemble hell's parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   We built a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   We paved over our own history.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley is right. We screwed this thing up pretty badly. But
there are smart, impartial analysts out there who make a compelling
argument that breaking up now will only add to the misery. The most
serious problems--traffic, air quality, schools--won't be any easier
to fix, and might become even more intractable.</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, a proud tradition around here of doing the
wrong thing when it comes to public policy. This is no time to change
course.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, we've got to start thinking of ourselves in the basin. We
can only wonder how much further along we'd be in creating a real
downtown--a thriving center of commerce and culture--if we hadn't
been delivering services halfway to Magic Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to cut the Valley loose. Not for their sake, but our
own. If the sprawl that defines the Valley was our original sin,
secession must be our penance.</TE>
<TE>   Go with God, Less Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   And, please, take Jim Hahn with you.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Is Falsely Accused in PR Snafu</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's spin machine spun out of control Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A week after hiring the high-priced crisis management and public
relations firm Sitrick and Co., the Los Angeles Archdiocese issued a
news release announcing an allegation of sexual misconduct against
Mahony, as well as the cardinal's emphatic denial.</LD>
<LD>   A man claimed that he was forced to inappropriately touch Mahony
two decades ago in Stockton, the release said.</LD>
<TE>   But the alleged victim told The Times that he never made such an
accusation.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he said in a telephone interview, he has never met the
cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   The man said he had sent the archdiocese in Stockton a letter
earlier this week, saying that he was ashamed of the way the church
has handled sexual abuse by priests. The man said he wrote, "I want
to see his face in court," referring to Mahony, who was the bishop of
Stockton from 1980 to 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, a Mahony spokesman, said the archdiocese learned from
The Times late Tuesday that the Stockton man had not accused Mahony
of any sexual impropriety. The archdiocese released a second news
release, titled "Archdiocese Receives Independent Corroboration That
Allegation of Sexual Abuse Against Cardinal Roger Mahony Is False."</TE>
<TE>   In the first news release, Mahony denied the allegation, saying
that he has "never engaged in any sexual activity, abuse or
misconduct with anyone throughout my 40 years as a priest and a
bishop." Mahony said he urged his representatives to alert Stockton
police and asked for "an immediate and full investigation." Mahony,
in the release, pledged his full cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said Mahony learned of the allegation from archdiocese
lawyers. They told the cardinal that the man's grandmother had
reported to Mahony in 1982 that a priest molested him. After that
conversation, the victim--who was about 10--alleged that Mahony took
him aside and encouraged the boy to inappropriately touch him,
according to the news release.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not know anyone by the name of the individual making the
allegation, nor do I know his grandmother," Mahony said in his
statement for the media.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old Stockton man, whose name is being withheld at his
request, said he had "issues" with Father Oliver O'Grady, a Stockton
priest who was accused of molesting two brothers and was then moved
to another parish by Mahony, where he continued to molest.</TE>
<TE>   O'Grady's victims won a $30-million jury verdict, which was later
negotiated to $7 million. Mahony testified in the civil trial that he
was unaware of the accusations against O'Grady when he transferred
him.</TE>
<TE>   In April, a Fresno woman with a history of mental illness claimed
that Mahony molested her 32 years ago. The cardinal, who denied the
allegations, was cleared by police.</TE>

<HD>Officer in Trouble for Bush Criticism</HD>
<DH>Military: The Air Force colonel could be court-martialed
for saying president let the Sept. 11 attacks occur.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A U.S. Air Force colonel who called President Bush "a joke" and
accused him of allowing the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to happen
because "his presidency was going nowhere" has been suspended and
could face a court-martial.</LD>
<LD>   The letter from Lt. Col. Steve Butler, who was vice chancellor for
student affairs at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, was
published May 26 in the Herald of Monterey County.</LD>
<LD>   "He did nothing to warn the American people because he needed this
war on terrorism," Butler wrote. "His daddy had Saddam and he needed
Osama. His presidency was going nowhere ....This guy is a joke."</LD>
<TE>   Butler, who called Bush's alleged silence "sleazy and
contemptible," was suspended from his position May 29 pending the
outcome of an investigation into his remarks, Air Force spokeswoman
Valerie Burkes said Tuesday. He remains assigned to the Defense
Language Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Butler, who entered active duty in April 1979, was a navigator
during Desert Storm, Burkes said. His wife, Shelly, told the Herald
that Butler plans to retire in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Military law specifically prohibits "contemptuous words against
the president" and other political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The prohibition against anti-government speech goes back to 1776,
when soldiers were forbidden from using "traitorous or disrespectful
words." The rules were updated several times and "traitorous or
disrespectful" changed to "contemptuous." The president, vice
president, Congress and state governors also were specifically banned
as targets of badmouthing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice and
the prohibition against contemptuous language survived intact as
Article 88, and, for the first time, applied only to commissioned
officers.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum punishment under Article 88 is dismissal, forfeiture
of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.</TE>

<HD>Surfing Attorneys Are Just Asking for a Whole New Slew of
Lawyer Jokes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read in the L.A. Daily Journal that a new group called the Surfing
Lawyers Assn. will gather next week in Santa Monica for its first
official meeting.</LD>
<LD>   The group plans to design a logo, Web site, bumper stickers and
T-shirts and will even hold some meetings on the water.</LD>
<LD>   I think we can all agree it's nice to see lawyers chasing waves
for a change.</LD>
<TE>   I just hope that the coastal cities have erected adequate
cautionary signs for the surfing barristers, i.e., "Warning: Waves
are powerful forces that can hurt you."</TE>
<TE>   By the way, I know that someone out there will ask me if I've
heard the joke that Danny DeVito utters in the 1989 movie "War of the
Roses."</TE>
<TE>   So I might as well tell it. It's the joke that begins: "What do
you call 10,000 lawyers at the bottom of the ocean?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer: "A good start."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the group can put that on its T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Funny furniture: To get you in the mood for a relaxing summer,
this column spotlights the following buys (see accompanying):</TE>
<TE>   Some covers for your sagging mattress (Mary Harris).</TE>
<TE>   A water bed that must be X-rated (Hal Durion of Claremont).</TE>
<TE>   And a loveseat that would be perfect for the leader of an oil
kingdom (Leslie Ogden of San Luis Obispo).</TE>
<TE>   Long on confusion: It's been sort of a disorienting week in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   On the recording for jurors phoning to check their status, the
clerk mistakenly said "January" instead of "June" several times.</TE>
<TE>   One juror group, for instance, was told not to report for duty on
Monday but to "call again Tuesday, Jan. 4."</TE>
<TE>   Then, for Tuesday's general election, the city's sample ballot had
the correct date but became confused over the name of the cartoon
character (Phil? Fill?) it designed to help voters avoid election
snafus (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   While it's January in Long Beach ...: It appears to be December in
Huntington Beach. The police log of that city's Wave reported: "Some
time during the night, someone spread fake snow on several lawns."</TE>
<TE>   Valley alert: Radio station KCRW produced a tape of "The
Zebra-Striped Hearse," by Ross Macdonald, about an overprotective
Bel-Air father who hires private detective Lew Archer after his
24-year-old daughter runs off with a mysterious painter.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the action is set in and around Los Angeles, and this is
one time the Valley won't feel left out.</TE>
<TE>   When the father (played by Ed Asner) fires Archer (Harris Yulin),
he shouts, "Get out of my house! Get out, you hear?"</TE>
<TE>   Responds Archer: "They can hear you in Tarzana."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The Huntington Beach Wave's crime report also included
the sighting of a "suspicious person" described as an older man
"wearing a baseball cap and a fatigue shirt walking down the street
looking eccentric."</TE>
<TE>   It's the last time I go for a walk in that city.</TE>

<HD>Air Passenger Screening: Who Should Be Checked? And Why?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Wayne Airport is getting a new federal security chief, but why
anyone would want the job is beyond me. It sounds like a job that
would send you to bed every night hoping a national disaster won't
strike on your watch. That kind of stress can't be good for one's
long-term health.</LD>
<LD>   The new director in Orange County, Ashley "Skip" Williams, becomes
part of the country's program to federalize airport security under
the new Transportation Security Administration.</LD>
<LD>   At or near the top of the agency's to-do list is figuring out how
to handle passenger screening. Should security forces check only
people who appear to be of Middle Eastern lineage, as many have
argued since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11? Or, should they be
more random, so as to parcel out the inconvenience to passengers and
avoid charges of racial profiling?</LD>
<TE>   As a 50ish blue-eyed blond who was pulled aside for screening last
week at Reagan National Airport in Washington, I have fresh thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   It was my first airplane trip since last summer. In a pre-Sept. 11
world, I would have been irritated at being electronically frisked.
Not this time. I kibitzed with the screener, telling him I was
"excited" about being selected. He took that in good humor and ran a
detector over my clothing.</TE>
<TE>   He got a beep from a small clasp in my sunglasses but let me keep
them. He hand-checked the metal button on my jeans after he got a
beep from it.</TE>
<TE>   The security check was not even a minor inconvenience. On the
scale of life's hassles, it was a 1 out of 10. In fact, because I
don't like profiling of ethnic groups, I took satisfaction in being
part of the group being screened.</TE>
<TE>   Upon reflection, however, I had to confess that was only half the
equation. That I was selectively checked doesn't address whether
people who more nearly match the profile of the Sept. 11 hijackers
also would be targeted.</TE>
<TE>   What I want to know is whether I would have been checked while
three Middle Eastern men in their early 30s in front of me sailed
through. Or, would each of the three have been checked too?</TE>
<TE>   If the policy had been to check all three merely because they
appear to be Middle Eastern, is that good or bad? If none had been
checked, would that be good or bad? Three such men weren't in line
with me, so I'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   Many people probably will be offended that I even ask such a
question. But not asking seems disingenuous.</TE>
<TE>   The lament is that checking Middle Easterners amounts to unfair
profiling. And common sense tells you that 99.9% of people who "look"
Middle Eastern are law-abiding people, who would rightly be angered
at being considered potential terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   But I'd put an asterisk by the assumption that giving them special
attention in airports amounts to racial profiling--akin to the
complaints that black motorists are stopped at rates much greater
than whites.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that black motorists have never threatened
terrorist actions against the nation. Islamic fundamentalists posing
as regular Joes have, in essence, declared such a war. That would
seem to help define the "target" group.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out, though, there is no such thing at the airport as a
target group--at least not based on appearance. A spokeswoman at the
Transportation Security Administration says passenger screening is
determined both by random checks and by computers that digest lots of
information about travelers, including such things as when a ticket
was bought and whether a person is traveling alone.</TE>
<TE>   The new agency doesn't screen people based on ethnicity or other
personal traits outlawed under federal anti-discrimination laws,
spokeswoman Deirdre O'Sullivan says. The agency also believes that
the random checks act as a deterrent to would-be hijackers, she says.
Let's hope so.</TE>
<TE>   Now that my maiden post-Sept. 11 flight is under my belt, I have
greater appreciation for the headaches facing airport security
officials. The next time I complain about my job, I'll ponder the one
awaiting Mr. Williams at John Wayne Airport.</TE>

<LD>Albin Krebs, 73, obituary writer for the New York Times for 20 years,
died Friday at his home in Key West, Fla., of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Krebs specialized in writing obituaries of major artists,
performers and politicians--such as Gene Autry, Truman Capote and
James Beard--from 1969 until he retired in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   The two decades capped his long career in journalism, which be-
gan during his college days at the University of Mississippi, where
he was editor of the student newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   When he advocated admitting blacks to Ole Miss in a 1952
editorial, a cross was burned outside his window.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, the Pascagoula, Miss., native was a reporter for
Newsweek covering the admission of James Meredith as his alma mater's
first black student.</TE>

<HD>Junket to Britain Was Enough to Send One Round the Bend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Of course they had to come. Of course they had to spend pots of money
while they were here.</LD>
<LD>   If they hadn't, would there have been one single soul in all of
London who would ever have heard of a place called Los Angeles?</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, whose expense
accounts were cracked open to the public gaze recently, sent an
entourage here one fine week in June a couple of years ago, and it
was nothing but work, work, work.</LD>
<TE>   They had to spend one entire afternoon consorting with two dozen
travel agents at Wimbledon, walking the hallowed grass to center
court, then gulping down hot tea in July as if they enjoyed it.</TE>
<TE>   They dragged themselves to dine on the nouvelle carnivore cuisine
at the Criterion, one of London's literally gilded restaurants, its
coved ceilings rich with gold and turquoise mosaic, its plates rich
with $25 a la carte beef, delivered with service one London
restaurant guide calls "arrogant" and at prices another considers
"ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   And then the very next night, they suffered through a gorgeously
mounted reception and another artery-insulting $11,600 dinner, this
one with the aristocrats of Britain's airlines in one of the royal
chambers at Kensington Palace that is available for rentals ("follow
in the footsteps of royalty" is the come-on).</TE>
<TE>   The things our leaders must endure for the good of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Kensington Palace is the place where, early one morning 165 years
ago this month, an 18-year-old girl still in her jammies was told she
had just become queen--Queen Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be good," was Victoria's first famous quote. Her second
one was, "We are not amused."</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos can fairly apply Victoria's standards to this six-figure
sojourn: Was it good? And did it leave us amused?</TE>
<TE>   To the second, obviously, "no." After the expense records became
public, albeit looking as heavily edited as FBI files, there was a
hurricane's worth of huffing and puffing from taxpayer groups and
elected officials: five nights in an $854 hotel suite! An $84,000
afternoon at Wimbledon courtside! And yet in three years, more than
40 major conventions lined up for L.A. bail out, and staff people
still get paid bonuses for landing canceled events?</TE>
<TE>   As to the first point, were they good? Did this semi-royal tour of
gilt and sweat accomplish anything?</TE>
<TE>   The standard line is yes, that spending money makes money. The
city's name in a new travel brochure lures the leisurely and their
lucre to L.A.'s ZIP Codes.</TE>
<TE>   It's the usual mantra for federal missions and local ones.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Sam Yorty got himself the nickname "Travelin' Sam" for
expensively roaming and grazing the world, and then Tom Bradley, who
had nailed Yorty for his to-and-fro-ing, did the same thing on trade
missions.</TE>
<TE>   It's much the same argument put forward by the British monarchy
and its adherents: Yes, it's expensive, but look at the value for
dollar. For the price of that bag of oats for a horse pulling the
royal carriage down the Mall, enough tourists show up to foot the
bill for every horse race at Ascot.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason L.A. already has a convention office in London.
It's on the third floor in a building just up the road from St.
James's Palace, where Prince Charles keeps an office; call the
number, and a pleasant young woman answers, "Los Angeles!" which is
very homey.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, the bureau spent thousands to sell L.A. in a place that is
pretty well sold on it already.</TE>
<TE>   The price of a ride on the London subway--about $2.40 in the
currency market of the moment--sends you past posters for Hollywood's
latest releases, counting the time lag for Britain, which evidently
quarantines them like dogs before they're allowed into the country.
There's a new ad for "Monster's Ball." The star is Halle Berry. Halle
Berry won an Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Where is the Oscar ceremony held? Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Then you leave the tube and step out into California-style
sunlight, as rare in London as a taxicab in L.A. That lady walking in
Kensington Gardens--you, madame. Your name? Nan Blythe of Glasgow.
Well, Mrs. Blythe, ever been to Los Angeles? "We went to Hawaii on
holiday and spent a few hours in the airport. It was quite nice, as
airports go." What do you think of when someone says "L.A."? "Where
the movies are. Earthquakes."</TE>
<TE>   Hmm, well, not much we can do about the seismics. But the airport
bit was encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   And you, young lady, in a shop in Kensington High Street. Kates
Laforet, all of 20. What do you think of Los Angeles? "I was there
two years ago, two weeks in California, a week of it in L.A." The
Laforets loved Santa Monica and Venice Beach and even Orange County,
and once you got the scale of it, it was quite glamorous. Her friends
were jealous. And L.A.--"I preferred it to San Francisco. San
Francisco, it's very normal. L.A.'s got a lot more character."</TE>
<TE>   There, you see?</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s competition is logistics. Not everyone who wants to come to
L.A. can manage it. London is equidistant from Los Angeles and
Vladivostok, and the new Euro-coziness means that alongside those
movie posters in the tube are enticements to a $75 round-trip fare
for a weekend getaway to Paris.</TE>
<TE>   But the logic of this L.A. junket remains elusive. Nine people fly
to Britain to feed a lot of British travel agents and airline execs
in places that are right around the corner from them--all to persuade
them how wonderful Los Angeles is?</TE>
<TE>   They hold court for travel and business writers in that $854 suite
at the Four Seasons--it was probably the cheapest suite, not even
named anything posh like the Wellington or the Mayfair suites, and
due to be redecorated--and try to cast the siren spell of Southern
California with black London taxis out there gliding down Park Lane?
One of these sessions was a 15-minute phone interview with a travel
magazine reporter that could have been done from a soundproof office
at LAX at a saving of, oh, $830 and change.</TE>
<TE>   (For three in the nine-member delegation--the city's legislative
analyst, Ron, duke of Deaton; His Lordship John Agoglia, marquess of
the Airports; and his squire, Phil Depoian of the Runways--the air
fares were $7,400 each. With the kind of insider schmoozing they did
with airline executives here, you'd think someone would have clued
them in about advance-purchase fares.)</TE>
<TE>   It would just be simpler to lure a few royals to L.A. and get
their fellow Brits to follow. The Getty House is empty, what with the
mayor commuting from San Pedro and all.</TE>
<TE>   And with the rumblings and grumblings about the monarchy even in
this jubilee week, there may be some royal folk looking for a new
place to lay their tiara-ed heads.</TE>
<TE>   And they're welcome to call collect.</TE>

<HD>Medicinal Pot Policy Criticized by Supervisors</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Board fumes that it wasn't consulted when
guidelines were set in March. Police agencies say that wasn't
required.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors criticized law enforcement leaders Tuesday
for quietly setting a standard for medicinal marijuana possession
without consulting local health officials, patients or other experts.</LD>
<LD>   Calling the guidelines narrow and incomplete, supervisors want
police officials who drafted the guidelines to reconvene and gather
more expert opinions on the issue.</LD>
<LD>   "I was never called on this," Supervisor John K. Flynn said during
the board's regular weekly meeting. "I'm really concerned."</LD>
<TE>   While the board has no authority over the multi-agency policy
adopted in late March, Flynn and other supervisors believe they
should have been consulted as the guidelines were being drafted and
that the process should have been more open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The policy came to light last month when a chronically ill Ventura
man complained to the board that police officers had confiscated most
of his plants despite his written doctor's recommendation to smoke
marijuana, as permitted under Proposition 215.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a request by Flynn, the county counsel's office
delivered a packet of information to the supervisors detailing the
history of the new guidelines, which allow a patient with a doctor's
note to possess six plants of any size or one pound of dried
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials said they spent two years researching
the policies of counties across the state and also studied written
testimony and evidence from patients and experts in science, law and
medicine. The policy was approved by the Sheriff's Department, the
district attorney's office and the chiefs of the county's five
independent police departments.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at feedback from all sides of this issue," Sheriff Bob
Brooks said in an interview Tuesday. "Our policy is a very liberal
understanding of the need for the medicinal use of marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks added that numerous county law enforcement policies are
made frequently without notifying the board.</TE>
<TE>   "The sheriff does not need board approval of our arrest policies
and practices," Brooks said, adding that he would agree to meet with
county department leaders and patients but did not expect specifics
of the marijuana policy to change.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, one of five area police chiefs who
approved the guidelines, concurred with Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've made a decision in a vacuum. A number of
policies in the state were consulted to formulate this," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 people addressed the board Tuesday on the issue, most
notably Jay Cavanaugh, a former member of the state board of
pharmacies who now runs the American Alliance for Medical Cannabis.</TE>
<TE>   "It surprised me to hear a number of supervisors comment about not
having been consulted," said Cavanaugh, who has a doctorate in
biochemistry and immunology.</TE>
<TE>   Cavanaugh told supervisors that possession guidelines need to take
into account that a patient who plants marijuana seeds won't know if
the plants are male or female until after they have spouted. This is
significant because only female plants produce smokable buds, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Cavanaugh challenged a police contention that most
marijuana plants yield up to a pound of smokable pot, saying a plant
will sometimes only produce an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   "This policy has a host of assumptions--that you will never have
any males, that all the plants will mature, that you won't have any
pest problems and that you won't lose anything," Cavanaugh said.</TE>

<HD>Explanation for Fatal Chase Offered</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Officers were warning pedestrians of danger,
officials said of the pursuit in which a girl died. Police panel
meets to review policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police officers involved in a pursuit that indirectly led
to the death of a young girl Saturday chased the reckless driver in
part to alert pedestrians to the danger he posed, police officials
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The comments followed a review of LAPD pursuit policies by the Los
Angeles Police Commission and supplied new details in the death of
4-year-old Evelyn Vargas on a busy downtown street in a
chain-reaction accident.</LD>
<LD>   Evelyn died after the stolen BMW sedan the suspect was driving hit
a minivan, which slammed into the light post that fell and hit her.
The suspect was hospitalized and is recovering from critical injuries
suffered in the crash.</LD>
<TE>   The LAPD is investigating the incident. The two officers involved,
driver Thomas Lo, 37, a seven-year veteran, and Manuel Gonzalez, 26,
a one-year veteran, have been given time off work and have been
described by LAPD officials as distraught.</TE>
<TE>   At a special hearing of the Police Commission on Tuesday,
commissioners said they will consider whether to alter the
department's pursuit policies. Police Commission President Rick J.
Caruso and Interim Police Chief Martin Pomeroy offered public
condolences to the girl's family. A City Council committee also plans
to review police pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   According to police officials, Officers Lo and Gonzalez
encountered the suspect when he came speeding out of a downtown
parking garage, tires squealing, as they were passing by in a patrol
car. Fearing a collision, the officers swerved to avoid him, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers then began trailing the BMW, initially without
turning on their lights or siren. They called for backup, and learned
that the car was stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the suspect knew that he was being tailed by police was
unclear. But shortly, he drove the BMW onto a sidewalk and through a
red light.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible he knew officers were behind him and made a crazy
decision. Then the officers made a rational decision to try to stop
him," said Cmdr. Gary Brennan.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that the officers turned on the siren and the lights,
and the pursuit began, police said. The suspect led the officers on a
circuitous 1.3-mile route through downtown for about 2 minutes,
hitting peak speeds of about 40 to 45 mph, police said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the driver stopped and started to open the car door.
But when the patrol car stopped behind him, he took off again,
eventually running a red light at 6th and Spring streets and hitting
the minivan, Brennan said. Suspected cocaine and drug paraphernalia
were found in the car, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In offering more details, LAPD officials were seeking to explain
the officers' decision to chase a speeding car through a crowded
shopping district.</TE>
<TE>   The officers' conduct came under fire from at least one speaker at
Tuesday's meeting: Stephany Yablow, daughter of an elderly couple
seriously injured in a police pursuit in March, said she was
"sickened" to hear of Saturday's death and urged the commission to
revise the LAPD's pursuit policies.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD is out of control," Yablow said, adding that the lives
of her parents--both Holocaust survivors--had been shattered by the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   Department policy and state laws allow senior officers room for
judgment in conducting pursuits. In this case, police officials
contended that the perceived danger to pedestrians triggered the
officers' response.</TE>
<TE>   "He drove up on the sidewalk, and they [the officers] decided
pedestrians were in danger," said Deputy Chief Margaret York. "They
activated their lights in an attempt to warn pedestrians ....The
officers were very concerned about pedestrian traffic."</TE>
<TE>   The overall number of LAPD police pursuits has declined this year,
said Deputy Chief David Doan. Although recent years have seen average
rates of between 55 and 65 pursuits per month, the tally this year is
about 30 per month, he said.</TE>

<HD>Coroner Rules 2 Deaths as Homicide</HD>
<DH>Crime: The victims are thought to be parents of gunman in
rampage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two people whose decomposed bodies were found in the home of the
man responsible for a gun rampage in a Long Beach supermarket were
victims of homicide, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The man was stabbed in the neck and hit on the head with a blunt
object, and the woman died from head trauma.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors said 48-year old Antonio Pineiro, who was fatally shot
by police in the market after killing two people there, lived with
his parents, who hadn't been seen in more than a year.</LD>
<TE>   "Our best guess is that these are his parents because of what
neighbors have said," said Lt. William Blair of the Long Beach Police
Department. Coroner's officials said they will use dental records to
make positive identifications.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Pineiro, without warning, began shooting at customers
in the Top Valu market, a block from his home.</TE>
<TE>   Three people, including Pineiro, died and four were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Police investigating the case discovered bodies lying side by side
on a bed in Pineiro's Cedar Avenue home.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro had said his parents moved to Miami, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some indicators that efforts were made to conceal the
odor," said coroner's spokesman David Campbell. He would not
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors described Pineiro's parents as friendly.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a sweet, sweet woman who blessed her doorstep before she
left the house," neighbor Paul Cook said last week.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-9, 280-pound Pineiro kept mostly to himself. No one
ever visited the quiet man, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were still searching to understand what triggered
the violence.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, we're still collecting information," Blair said.
"We just don't know very much."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said 8-year-old Barbara Ibasco, who was at the store
to buy ingredients for a chocolate cake, died after she was shot in
the head.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents, Myrna and Conrado, were shot and suffered superficial
wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Marcela Perez, a mother of four and grandmother of three, had just
started her cashier's shift when Pineiro opened fire and killed her.</TE>

<DH>Money: Rancho Santa Fe keeps quiet over new status as
wealthiest community in the U.S.</DH>

<DL>RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Here amid the eucalyptus trees, horse trails and multimillion-dollar
mansions, where life is unhurried and gracious, residents have a new
distinction: They live in the wealthiest community in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   With a burst of per capita income to $113,132, Rancho Santa Fe has
nosed out Atherton and Woodside in the San Francisco Bay Area, Palm
Beach, Fla., Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and other high-living rivals,
according to U.S. census data released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 5,000-plus residents of "the ranch," 25 miles north of San
Diego, are taking their newfound status with their usual understated
aplomb.</LD>
<TE>   "Life is cool here, dude," joked Arthur Laffer, author of the
Reagan administration economic theory called the Laffer Curve.</TE>
<TE>   This is a community where life revolves around the members-only
golf course and the Garden Club, a place where sidewalks and street
lights are forbidden, and where an ironclad homeowners' agreement
called "the Covenant" allows the Art Jury to decide even the smallest
detail of landscaping and architecture.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Beverly Hills in the country," said CBS sportscaster Dick
Enberg, who lived here for 17 years before moving two years ago to La
Jolla, to be closer to the private school his three teenagers attend.
"It's just idyllic."</TE>
<TE>   The success of Rancho Santa Fe as a community for the rich began
with its failure as a tree farm for the Santa Fe Railway. Before
World War I, the railroad planted thousands of eucalyptus trees on
what had largely been barren, rolling hills.</TE>
<TE>   But towering eucalyptus timber proved unsuitable for railroad
ties. That plan went bust. Today, long, winding driveways lead to
Spanish, Mediterranean and ranch-style homes (median value: $1.7
million) on minimum two-acre lots. Horse corrals and garages packed
with vintage cars are common.</TE>
<TE>   "People here have spent a lot of money for their homes, and they
expect their lifestyle to be protected," said Walt Ekard, former
manager of the Rancho Santa Fe Assn. "They're hard people to argue
with: Even when they're wrong, they sound right. These are people who
are used to being in charge."</TE>
<TE>   A who's-who of Fortune 500 executives, retired diplomats and
celebrities has called "the ranch" home: McDonald's heiress Joan
Kroc, ex-Universal Studios boss Sy Salkowitz, astronaut Wally
Schirra, actors Victor Mature and Robert Young, Taco Bell founder
Glenn Bell, Padre owner John Moores and Trevor Hoffman, a star relief
pitcher with the baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   More notorious residents included the Heaven's Gate cult members,
before their 1997 mass suicide, $100-million swindlers J. David
Dominelli and Nancy Hoover, before they went to prison, and a
mysterious Briton named Ian Spiro and his family before they were
murdered. (Conspiracy theories abound, but the official finding was
that Spiro, beset by financial and emotional problems, killed his
loved ones and committed suicide.)</TE>
<TE>   Like Howard Hughes before him, Bill Gates owns a home here, but
sightings are rare. Even if ranch residents have seen the Microsoft
baron, they probably would not say. Privacy and discretion are local
virtues.</TE>
<TE>   For such a rich community, discussion of money--particularly
around outsiders--is considered boorish.</TE>
<TE>   "Darn, we have great weather here," said John Marelli, who gave
his profession as farmer when asked Tuesday about the community's
wealth. He was taking putting practice at the golf club founded in
1927 by Bing Crosby.</TE>
<TE>   Publicity from the census findings--which apply to communities
with more than 1,000 households--is anything but relished here.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing in this world we want is to be known as the
richest town in America," said Sandy Bien, vice president of the
Garden Club. "We're just a pretty, quaint community full of everyday
people."</TE>
<TE>   Retired executive Bill Cavanaugh concurred: "It's a mixed
blessing. I'd prefer to remain anonymous."</TE>
<TE>   To enforce its coveted anonymity, the community forbids mailboxes.
The local post office is the unofficial gathering spot. "If not for
the post office, you'd never see your neighbor," said real estate
agent Patrick Galvin.</TE>
<TE>   To thwart looky-loos after the suicide of 39 Heaven's Gate
believers five years ago, the Rancho Santa Fe Assn.--which functions
as a kind of city council--responded by changing the name of the
street where the cult had lived in a rented mansion.</TE>
<TE>   When former President Clinton arrived here for a fund-raiser, the
mostly Republican residents complained that the Secret Service
motorcade scared the horses.</TE>
<TE>   Prying media and noisy politicians are not this community's only
concern.</TE>
<TE>   Its main street is choked each morning and evening with commuters
passing through from the coast to the inland portions of the county
and vice-versa.</TE>
<TE>   One Rancho Santa Fe matron some years ago wrote a Spanish-English
guide for residents to be able to communicate with their hired help.</TE>
<TE>   Locals are willing to live with those trifles. They show no signs
of wanting to throw off their splendid isolation, consistently
turning down the idea of becoming a city.</TE>
<TE>   Cityhood is seen as a threat to preserving the good life. The
Covenant has done its job in governing land use. Cityhood, residents
concluded, might mean opening up Art Jury meetings to the public and
lifting the residents-only restrictions on the soccer fields.</TE>
<TE>   "What I tell clients," said real estate agent Galvin, standing at
a $5-million, four-acre home with an ocean view, "is this: If you
want paradise in your lifetime, come out to 'the ranch.'"</TE>

<HD>Woman Is Arrested in Razor Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Orange County deputies detain suspect leaving a
Mission Viejo park where hazards are found. It is the tenth
playground targeted.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 21-year-old Mission Viejo woman was arrested early Tuesday for
allegedly placing razor blades and other sharp objects at parks
across south Orange County over the last two months.</LD>
<LD>   A surveillance team of undercover sheriff's deputies detained Lori
Elizabeth Fischer as she tried to leave Vista del Lago Park in
Mission Viejo about 1:30 a.m. A search of the area turned up several
sharp objects that had just been planted, deputies said.</LD>
<LD>   Fischer had been considered a suspect for at least several days,
officers said. Sheriff's detectives saw her acting suspiciously
several nights ago at another park, prompting them to place a
tracking device on her car to monitor her movements, authorities
said.</LD>
<TE>   Fischer, who works as a clerk at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service office in Laguna Niguel, was described by
neighbors and friends as a troubled loner. She was sometimes heard
screaming late at night from inside her parents' house, prompting at
least one neighbor to call police. They also said she pedaled her
bike around the neighborhood, singing loudly.</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Mann, 15, who has known Fischer for five years, said her
friend frequently visited local parks late at night but expressed
disbelief that she could be responsible. "She likes to walk, and she
said she likes to clear her head," Mann said. "She's quiet, nice and
sweet in a compassionate way. She's so far from the sadistic
psychopath that would do this."</TE>
<TE>   Fischer was booked into the Orange County Central Women's Jail in
Santa Ana on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and child
endangerment. She is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail--twice the
standard bail for murder suspects.   Laguna Beach police said they
believe Fischer was the woman who made an anonymous 911 call in April
to warn police that friends were going to hurt people at a Laguna
Beach park. Hours later, 17 razors were discovered buried in the sand
at a playground on the city's Main Beach.</TE>
<TE>   That discovery marked the beginning of a string of 10 similar
crimes that involved razor blades and nails planted at parks in
Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest and Mission Viejo. Though no one has been
reported injured by the objects, the discoveries jangled the nerves
of parents of young children throughout south Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   City officials in Mission Viejo, where sharp objects were found in
seven parks, expressed relief at the arrest and said investigators
believe Fischer is responsible for all the recent incidents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we've all been concerned about," said Sherri
Butterfield, the city's mayor pro tem. "Clearly, this is someone who
needs help."</TE>
<TE>   However, police cautioned that some of the episodes may be the
work of others.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say so early in the game that [Fischer] is the sole
person responsible because there might be copycats out there," Laguna
Beach Police Sgt. Jason Kravetz said.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, razor blades or nails were placed at the ends of
slides, on the stairways up to the slides, at the bottoms of slides
and in play areas.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa and Newport Beach police said they are investigating
whether Fischer is linked to an almost identical wave of razor
findings last year at six parks. Police never identified a culprit in
those incidents, which ended in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The recent discoveries sparked a massive community and
law-enforcement attempt to catch the culprit. A reward was offered.
Police brought in bloodhounds and tried to identify fingerprints
found on the razors with little success.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, tips poured in to police, who drew up a list of 20
suspects. Among them was Fischer, who was soon visited by sheriff's
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Mann said Fischer recently told her that she had been interrogated
for several hours by detectives, who gave her a voice-stress test to
determine whether she was telling the truth. Fischer, Mann said, also
told her that she was depressed and that her relationships with
family members were strained.</TE>
<TE>   Plainclothes sheriff's detectives spent Tuesday morning removing
papers and other items from the Mission Viejo home Fischer shares
with her parents.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer's family declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>L.A. City Council Approves Redrawn Boundaries for 7 School
Board Districts</HD>
<DH>Education: Three of the areas represent Latino majorities,
and two are entirely in the Valley. The map changes go into effect
July 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After five months of debate, the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday
approved new boundaries for the seven seats on the Los Angeles Board
of Education, creating three Latino majority districts and two wholly
in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley is currently divided among four school board members,
three of whom also represent other parts of the sprawling Los Angeles
Unified School District. Under the plan approved Tuesday, there will
be two new all-Valley seats and one that combines southwest Valley
communities, such as Woodland Hills, with the Westside.</LD>
<LD>   The map, approved on a 13-2 vote, was advocated by school board
President Caprice Young, whose new District 3 will shift from being
centered in East Hollywood to being centered in the West Valley,
where she grew up and still has ties. Young was elected in 1999 with
strong support from then-Mayor Richard Riordan, whose allies helped
her in the recent remapping.</LD>
<TE>   The approved plan defeated one advocated by veteran school Trustee
Julie Korenstein, whose San Fernando Valley-based District 6 will
shift eastward in the Valley, costing her some of her current voter
base and giving her district a Latino majority.</TE>
<TE>   The new boundaries maintain two Latino majority seats in eastern
Los Angeles, which are currently represented by board members Jose
Huizar in District 2 and David Tokofsky in District 5. Tokofsky was
upset with a previous attempt to push his seat out of most of his
northeast Los Angeles base, but he will hang on to some of it as his
district moves east and south.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos make up 70% of L.A. Unified's 900,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good thing for the Latino community," Amadis Velez, of the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said of the map,
which his organization influenced.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that will give greater representation and makes
our representatives more responsive to the needs of the community,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lines, which are redrawn every 10 years to reflect demographic
shifts, were narrowly recommended in March by a citizen's commission
appointed by the mayor, the City Council president and school board
members. The group, known as the Los Angeles Redistricting Commission
for the Los Angeles Unified School District, was created in
accordance with 1999 charter reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council has final say on the boundaries, even
though other cities send their youngsters to L.A. Unified schools.</TE>
<TE>   The approved boundaries will be implemented on July, and the first
elections based on them will take place next year.</TE>
<TE>   The maps pushed by Young and Korenstein had different takes on a
single problem--that the Valley's 1.44 million residents need the
equivalent representation of 2.2 board members, meaning some Valley
communities would have to share a district with non-Valley areas.</TE>
<TE>   The approved map will combine southwest Valley communities such as
Woodland Hills and Encino with West L.A. in District 4. Korenstein,
who had the support of the teachers union, had proposed putting North
Hollywood and Studio City in the West L.A. district instead. She said
the North Hollywood area had better freeway access to West L.A. than
Woodland Hills, and thus should be placed in the same district.
Korenstein added that she believes the new boundaries will increase a
sense of alienation that is fueling the Valley movement to secede
from the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein wanted to get the West Valley, which will be Young's
territory starting next month. Both of them are white, as are most of
the voters in the West Valley. But both said ethnicity in that area
was not a factor in their map proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be fine," said Korenstein, a 15-year veteran of the board.
"I'm looking forward to meeting my new constituents."</TE>
<TE>   Board member Marlene Canter, who represents District 4, applauded
the council's decision and said people who live in Woodland Hills are
well acquainted with West L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really pleased the council respected the process," Canter
said, referring to the council's approval of the commission's plan.
"I don't think my area has a relationship [with the North Hollywood
area]."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who headed a City Council school
redistricting committee, voted for the Young plan, explaining it was
the will of the citizen's commission and of the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Representing 635,000 people as a school board member is difficult
regardless of where you are," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission drew criticism for not attracting enough public
input and for behind-the-scenes political maneuvering. Several people
complained that Riordan had too much influence on the decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "What you are seeing is [Riordan's] vision being enforced on the
whole city," said teachers union President Day Higuchi.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, in an interview Tuesday, said parents and students should
thank him for pushing for school reform through trustees such as
Young.</TE>

<HD>Disney Touts Safety</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Firm says it is showing its commitment to
security at amusement parks after recent accidents.</DH>

<LD>The Walt Disney Co. introduced its chief safety officer and detailed
a host of safety measures taken at its U.S. theme parks as part of a
public awareness campaign launched Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Company officials said that because of heightened public concern
over safety and security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, they
were publicizing improvements to rides and giving people an
unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at operations in Disney's six
theme parks in Anaheim and Florida.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a big change," new Chief Safety Officer Greg Hale said
during a briefing and tour at Disneyland in Anaheim. The change, he
said, is in discussing safety measures and procedures publicly--not a
new commitment to ride safety.</LD>
<TE>   Following two high-profile accidents in the last few years, Disney
has changed rides and revised procedures at its parks. Company
officials emphasized Tuesday that the changes were part of an ongoing
review, not the result of accidents or lawsuits. Among the
improvements detailed in a 30-page safety report released Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Roughly 10,000 new warning signs with international symbols have
been placed in lines and aboard rides, and audio notices in English
and Spanish tell passengers to keep hands and legs inside.</TE>
<TE>   * Automated gates at several attractions prevent visitors from
jumping on a ride too soon or stepping into the path of an oncoming
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   * About 4,000 employees in Orlando, Anaheim and on the Disney
Cruise Lines have been trained to use the company's 600 automatic
defibrillators.</TE>
<TE>   * Paramedics are stationed at parks in Anaheim and Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   * Rides are continually adjusted and improved. For example,
Disneyland's Splash Mountain reopened over Memorial Day weekend with
a redesigned boat that has individual, rather than group, seats.</TE>
<TE>   * Goofy's Magic Measure has been added--an ultrasonic device that
measures children's heights and determines which attractions they can
ride safely.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland came under the scrutiny of legislators and ride safety
advocates after a Christmas Eve 1998 accident on the Columbia ship. A
cleat tore free from the boat and struck a tourist in the head,
killing him. Disneyland cleaned up the scene and interviewed
witnesses before police arrived hours later.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, 4-year-old Brandon Zucker was critically
injured after being trapped underneath a car in the Roger Rabbit Car
Toon Spin. State investigators blamed flawed ride design and also
said ride operators did not load the boy properly. The corporation
has since reached settlements in both accidents.</TE>

<TE>   Following two high-profile accidents in the past few years, Disney

<TE>   La Jolla mother and amusement park safety advocate Kathy Fackler,
whose son was injured on a Disneyland roller coaster, welcomed
Disney's new openness after reviewing the report online. She said
that she was happy to see improved child restraints and signage on a
recent visit to Disney's California Adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "They're moving toward the kind of real communication that I've
asked them for 41/2 years," Fackler said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Beverly Hills attorney Barry Novack said he doesn't see
any major change.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of words," said Novack, a lawyer for several clients
who were injured at Disney theme parks. "It's like saying, 'We
believe in safety.' ... This looks like a public relations campaign
to try and reshift the image of the mouse."</TE>

<HD>Attias Case Goes to Jury After Two-Month Trial</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors in the two-month trial of David Attias heard closing arguments
Monday and began deliberations in the murder case that included
testimony from more than 100 witnesses, many of them detailing
Attias' history of mental problems.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick McKinley told jurors the former UC
Santa Barbara freshman was "a mad, violent, angry and aggressive"
young man who chose to speed his car down a crowded street in Isla
Vista on Feb. 23, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney Jack Earley countered by saying the 20-year-old
son of Hollywood director Daniel Attias was a sick young man "pulled
away from reality" by his mental illness like a swimmer caught in a
raging riptide.</LD>

<HD>Supervisors Ponder Tighter Rules for County Campaign Slate
Mailers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors are considering whether to regulate
political slate mailers devoted mostly to targeting--or touting--a
single county candidate.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment to the county's campaign reform ordinance would
extend the $1,000 contribution limit to cover mailers produced or
distributed with the cooperation of a candidate or the candidate's
campaign manager or agent.</LD>
<LD>   The candidate would be required to pay his or her share of the
mailer's production or distribution costs, which typically far exceed
the $1,000 limit.</LD>
<TE>   The reforms were suggested after the March election by Board
Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who lost reelection in a hard-fought race
against Supervisor-elect Chris Norby, and by longtime government
watchdog Shirley Grindle of Orange. Supervisors will review a first
reading of the new law at their June 25 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Coad was the subject of more than a dozen critical mailers
produced by a slate-mail organization run by opponents of a proposed
airport at the former El Toro Marine base. Coad supported the
airport; Norby opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the mailers were devoted to attacking Coad's positions,
with only a small portion reserved for other candidates and issues
that must be present to qualify for slate-mailer status under state
law.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions proposed Tuesday would require candidates to pay the
cost of mailers where more than 25% of the surface area is devoted to
either promoting their candidacy or attacking an opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The amount would be subject to the $1,000 limit and would be
considered a contribution from the slate-mailer organization or from
a third party who donated to the mailer.</TE>
<TE>   Any amount above $1,000 would have to be refunded.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions would establish a relationship between a candidate
and a slate mailer organization if any of the costs of the mailer
were paid by the candidate, a photo was supplied, or there was other
consultation or conferences regarding timing, content or
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   That definition sparked a question from Supervisor Todd Spitzer,
who worried that candidates might be held liable for the unauthorized
use of their names, photos or positions on slate mailers, which could
exceed 25% of the surface area.</TE>
<TE>   Slate mailers have wide latitude on what to include; the only
requirement is that they indicate whether candidates or ballot
measures paid for their placement on the mailer.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he paid deposits to be placed on several slates for
his Assembly race this year but dropped off the slates after no other
Republican candidate filed to run against him in the March primary.
Some slates went ahead and ran his photo and position statements
without his approval, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested adding provisions that a candidate knowingly
influence production of the mailers.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Hotline Taking Numbers of Bad Teen Drivers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to put the brakes on teenage hot-rodders, the Ventura County
Sheriff's Department is calling on motorists to use a hotline to
report offenders.</LD>
<LD>   The Sheriff's Teen Traffic Offender Program, or STTOP, allows
drivers who see aggressive or dangerous driving by a teenager to
report the incident to deputies, who then visit the teen's home.</LD>
<LD>   "This is like a big, giant, mobile Neighborhood Watch program,"
said Sgt. Patti Salas of the Thousand Oaks traffic bureau.</LD>
<TE>   "Parents do not know what the kids are doing when they're out
driving by themselves," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers under age 20 account for a disproportionate number of
traffic fatalities, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, there were two double fatalities last year
involving teens. Last June, two girls died in Ventura when the car
they were riding in plunged off the Ventura Freeway. In December, two
boys died in Thousand Oaks when their sport-utility vehicle spun out
of control and crashed into a brick wall.</TE>
<TE>   STTOP is designed to intervene before youthful rowdiness can
develop into bad habits, or tragedy, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to reduce the instances of dangerous teen driving,"
said Salas, who is heading the program in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   When drivers in Oak Park, Moorpark or Thousand Oaks--east county
communities served by the Sheriff's Department--see an unsafe teen
driver, they can call a toll-free number to report the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not interested in 40 [mph] in a 35 zone," Salas said.</TE>
<TE>   She said deputies would rather hear about more dangerous
behaviors, such as racing, aggressive driving or tailgating.</TE>
<TE>   As always, she said, immediate threats to public safety should be
reported to 911, regardless of the age of the driver.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask [callers] to leave as much information as they can," Salas
said. "The most important thing for us to come up with is a license
plate number."</TE>
<TE>   Callers also should leave information on the type of behavior,
make and color of the vehicle, as well as the time of day and
location, Salas said.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after receiving the call, a deputy will visit the
teen's home and have a talk with the parents on aggressive driving.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal here is to let the parents know these are all the
impacts of your kid driving foolishly," Salas said. "It's not going
to be a door knock and then leave."</TE>
<TE>   The deputy will not issue a citation to the offender, unless the
person has committed a serious crime such as a hit-and-run, she
added.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't punitive," Salas said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no sanctions involved. Our goal is to share information."</TE>
<TE>   Callers remain anonymous to the offender. "Hopefully, that
encourages them to continue to call," Salas said.</TE>
<TE>   STTOP was created two years ago at the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department's Lost Hills station.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County and Ventura County agencies now share the
hotline.</TE>
<TE>   Each month, the hotline receives 30 to 35 reports of rowdy teen
driving, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Mike Woodard said. Most
of those callers provide enough information for a visit, Woodard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Woodard, who works exclusively with STTOP, meets with parents and
offers tips on how to better monitor their teen's driving habits.
Parents can track mileage, restrict souped-up car modifications or
perform their own stakeout to watch their children's driving habits.</TE>
<TE>   "I remind the parents that this [driving] is a privilege," Woodard
said. "It can be revoked at any time."</TE>

<HD>County Budget Includes $17 Million in Cuts</HD>
<DH>Spending: State shortfall will likely force supervisors to
economize even more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors adopted a $1.2-billion preliminary budget
Tuesday that trims more than $17 million from government programs for
the poor and slashes 140 vacant positions.</LD>
<LD>   But the worst could be yet to come, county officials cautioned.</LD>
<LD>   State legislators are wrangling over how to deal with California's
projected $23.6-billion budget shortfall. Depending on what they and
Gov. Gray Davis decide, even more draconian reductions could be on
the way, County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston said.</LD>
<TE>   "You can only go so far with working harder and smarter.... In the
end, there will be fewer employees doing the work," he told
supervisors just before they unanimously adopted a draft version of
the county's 2002-03 budget.</TE>
<TE>   Total revenues are projected to increase 2.18% in the coming year,
to just under $1.2 billion. But the cost of negotiated salary
increases, spiraling health insurance premiums and other items is
climbing much faster, leading to the budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   General fund dollars, the crucial pot of discretionary money that
supervisors use to pay for a variety of services, are expected to
fall 2.23% over the current-year budget.</TE>
<TE>   The fiscal plan avoids dipping into reserves to make up the
funding shortfall, a practice that in past years masked a growing
structural imbalance, Johnston said. When a final version is adopted
by supervisors later this month, the county budget will be balanced
for the first time in years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That cautious approach paid off when officials learned Tuesday
that the county will maintain top marks on Wall Street for
creditworthiness. County officials traveled to New York last week to
explain the new fiscal strategy to two influential credit-rating
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Both agencies, Moody's Investor Services and Standard &amp; Poor's,
responded with top credit ratings for the county. That means the
county will qualify for low-interest rates when it borrows money, a
crucial cost-cutting goal.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest question--how much of the county's state funding
will be cut--remains unanswered. In a budget revision last month,
Davis proposed cutting more than $1 billion in disbursements to
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Initial estimates show that could mean another $23 million in lost
revenue for Ventura County and the elimination of 91 more jobs.
Davis' reductions fall heaviest in the areas of health and social
services for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen speakers at Tuesday's meeting urged supervisors to fight
proposed state reductions in crucial government programs, such as
Medi-Cal and CalWORKS, the state's welfare-to-work program.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers accused Davis and state legislators of trying to
balance the budget on the backs of the state's neediest citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of service cuts, they said, the Legislature should back a
proposal by Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco) to raise taxes on
California's wealthiest residents. Burton's bill, SB 1255, would add
a 10% tax rate for single taxpayers with incomes in excess of
$130,000 or married filers with incomes exceeding $260,000.</TE>
<TE>   About 2% of Californians would fall into the new tax bracket,
according to the California Budget Project, an advocacy group for the
poor.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is the richest Californians that profited from prosperous
times, it is fair to ask them to bear a larger share of the tough
times," said Das Williams, legislative analyst for CAUSE, a regional
poverty advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the budget ax would fall heaviest on
departments not involved in public safety. Agencies that fix
potholes, run parks and administer health-care, agricultural and
welfare programs would see an average 4.2% cut.</TE>
<TE>   Four public safety departments that receive special
funding--sheriff, district attorney, public defender and
probation--would see an increase of 2.1% over current levels.
Johnston said those departments' budgets are protected by a county
policy that funnels all proceeds from a special half-cent sales tax
to them.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the first time that public safety budgets would receive
only a standard inflationary increase, instead of the double-digit
hikes of previous years, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Bob Brooks has said the modest increase is less than he
needs to continue his operations at current levels. The sheriff
estimates that he will have to trim 36 positions, 16 from patrol
units and 20 from the county's jails.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury would lose 23 positions, and
Public Defender Ken Clayman eight slots if the preliminary budget is
adopted.</TE>

<HD>San Jose Orchestra Muted by Rising Debts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Jose Symphony officials announced Tuesday that the 123-year-old
orchestra--the oldest in the West--will stand silent until it can
clear up debts and reorganize, leaving this Silicon Valley
headquarters as the largest U.S. city without its own symphony.</LD>
<LD>   The 89-member orchestra will give a farewell concert Saturday
before heading to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in an effort to clear up
mounting debts that this year exceeded $3 million, or more than a
third of its $7.8-million annual budget, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Since its season was unofficially canceled in October because of
financial problems, the symphony has performed only a series of
benefit concerts planned long before. Officials hope to have a
smaller, revamped version of the arts group performing in six to 18
months.</LD>
<TE>   The shutdown means that one of California's wealthiest regions
will for the interim lose its oldest cultural institution. Begun in
1879, the orchestra outdates the more famous San Francisco Symphony,
founded in 1911.</TE>
<TE>   For many musicians, some of whom have played for the San Jose
orchestra more than four decades, news of the closure hit a sour
note. They said the symphony in recent years had struggled to
overcome several financial miscues and reach a youthful city, where
more than half the residents are younger than 35.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a dwindling audience and operating in the shadow of the
world-famous and better financed San Francisco Symphony, orchestra
organizers in San Jose borrowed money on credit, worsening the
group's financial health, officials acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's devastating,'' said Kristen Linfante, a violist and
chairwoman of the negotiating committee for the orchestra's
musicians. ''It's been frustrating for us, because this symphony has
been mismanaged for years. It has used poor judgment in so many
things, from budgeting to marketing. It's really been
dysfunctional.''</TE>
<TE>   San Jose Symphony conductor and music director Leonid Grin did not
return a telephone call seeking comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Les White, interim chief operating officer for the orchestra,
agreed with Linfante: ''What this tells us is that we needed to
manage the money situation a little tighter.''</TE>
<TE>   The symphony's failure comes as an encore to orchestra troubles in
other cities throughout California and the nation. In recent years,
the San Diego and Sacramento symphonies have suffered significant
financial problems. In San Diego, officials reorganized and are
rebuilding. The Sacramento symphony folded, although a smaller group
has since emerged.</TE>
<TE>   But San Jose officials are left pondering their lack of support
from a financial base that many symphonies would die for: the
millionaires of the Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   ''The Silicon Valley never supported us,'' said White, a former
San Jose city manager. ''That's one of the things we're going to have
to look at. This is a young, mobile group of people that we're going
to have to learn to appeal to.''</TE>
<TE>   According to a report released Tuesday by a symphony transitional
committee, the orchestra struggled to find its niche in the nation's
11th-largest city, which it called a relatively new metropolitan area
that ''does not have long-standing traditions in the arts or in
private funding for the arts.''</TE>
<TE>   Brent Assink, executive director of the San Francisco Symphony,
said it does not take for granted the community support that provides
for a $47-million annual budget, one of the largest among the
nation's major orchestras. By contrast, Chicago and Los Angeles have
budgets of $59 million and $52 million, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't envy San Jose's efforts to reach supporters in
the Silicon Valley, where workers spend so much time writing software
programs, they don't have time for ones featuring Beethoven.</TE>
<TE>   ''So many people there come from other places, including San
Francisco,'' he said. ''They work a huge number of hours. Many just
aren't connected to the community. And if they are, they're
postponing their leisure time to some other period in their lives.
Right now, they're just working.''</TE>
<TE>   The San Jose Symphony's advisory panel report cited other problems
as well: Despite the area's high level of income, San Jose ranked
39th in per-capita giving among the nation's 50 largest metropolitan
areas. ''In addition,'' the report concluded, ''Silicon Valley
companies are feeling vulnerable to today's difficult economic
situation, so timing is an issue.''</TE>
<TE>   Unlike San Francisco, San Jose is not a tourist destination and
does not have a vibrant downtown area with restaurants and other
attractions to draw arts patrons.</TE>
<TE>   And in an area in which a quarter of the residents are younger
than 14, families with small children are ''less likely to
participate frequently in the arts than are adults of 45 and older,''
the report said.</TE>
<TE>   But community leaders said they had not given up hope.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is not necessarily a black mark on this area,'' said Nancy
Glaze, director of the arts program for the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation and chairwoman of the symphony's advisory panel. ''We have
a very sophisticated group of people here and an enormous amount of
passion for great music. The classical music station is the most
listened-to station in the whole area. We just need to find ways to
tap into that interest.''</TE>
<TE>   She said many orchestras nationwide in similar financial straits
will watch how San Jose reacts to its crisis. ''They're going to be
taking a look at the new orchestra we come up with.''</TE>
<TE>   According to guidelines set by the advisory panel, the orchestra
must not only establish new management and a board of directors but
find a new artistic direction and effective marketing methods.</TE>
<TE>   White said changes will also include cutting back on the 10 to 12
concerts a year and featuring the orchestra at community events in
schools and parks in which the audience has a role in deciding the
music that is played.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's no reason to put our head in the sand and say it's all
over,'' he said. ''A few of our donors said if we clean up our debt
and develop a plan, they'll be there with substantial dollars.''</TE>
<TE>   But that may be too late for musicians like Linfante.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old mother of two, whose husband is also a symphony
musician, says many of her orchestra colleagues are going back to
school to begin new careers.</TE>
<TE>   She said the symphony's average $24,000 annual salary--about
one-fourth the $90,000 paid to orchestra members in San
Francisco--puts them at the poverty level in the affluent Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have to find a way to tap into those Silicon Valley
dollars,'' she said. ''We have to go to that community and find out
how we can serve them better. And until now, that hasn't been
addressed.''</TE>

<HD>Airport Cab Firm Gets New Deal; Rivals Object</HD>
<DH>Transit: Competitors wanted to bid, but county supervisors
extend the 21/2-year pact on the basis of a staff recommendation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lucrative contract for taxi service at John Wayne Airport will go
to the company doing the job now, despite objections from competitors
who said there should have been a bidding process.</LD>
<LD>   "The taxi selection process for the airport should be opened to
all cab companies, and the county shouldn't be allowing a monopoly to
exist," said Coast Cab spokesman Mike Vali, who joined other cab
companies urging county supervisors to delay Tuesday's decision.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors unanimously approved the county staff's recommendation
to extend an exclusive contract for 2 1/2 years to John Wayne Airport
Yellow Cab Service, comprising Yellow Cab of Northern Orange County
Inc., Fiesta Taxi in Gardena and California Yellow Cab in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   The issue of airport cab service has been a thorny one in recent
years. In March 2000, airport administrators replaced contract holder
A Taxi of Santa Ana after the firm failed to provide proper
insurance. The company sued the county, seeking to be reinstated.
That case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Airport administrators then selected a newly formed company,
American Livery, which operated as American Taxi. It declared
bankruptcy a year later, owing Ford Motor Credit Co. $3.3 million for
its fleet of 140 cabs. On Nov. 28 last year, Ford repossessed the
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure continuation of service, the airport board gave director
Alan L. Murphy the authority to sign a contract with John Wayne
Airport Yellow Cab Service, hastily formed with about 50 cabs from
the three companies.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said Tuesday that the company was awarded the contract
because airport passengers have expressed satisfaction with the cabs
and service. The contract fills the term of the American Livery pact.</TE>
<TE>   Brian J. McCormack, attorney for A Taxi of Santa Ana, said before
the board Tuesday that the company lost the contract because of a
"minor insurance problem" and should have been considered. The
contract was worth about $5 million a year in gross receipts.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the board had assured A Taxi that the company would
be notified when a new contract was up for consideration, and that
was not done.</TE>
<TE>   After the board's decision Tuesday, Murphy cited the lawsuit as
one reason A Taxi was bypassed.</TE>
<TE>   "They are in litigation with the county basically because they did
not meet insurance requirements," Murphy said. "Staff did not feel it
was appropriate that A Taxi should be selected."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the insurance problem was not minor. "It was a major,
major, major issue for us because of the liability for the airport
and risk to our passengers," Murphy said.</TE>

<HD>Transportation Agency Wants to Fine Toll Cheaters an Extra
$5</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to reduce its high rate of toll cheaters, the operators of
Orange County's largest turnpike system on Tuesday proposed that
fines and processing fees be raised for motorists who refuse to pay.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendations are part of an 18-month effort by the Orange
County Transportation Corridor Agencies to improve toll enforcement
throughout the authority's 51-mile network of highways. "We want to
close the gap in our losses and make sure fines keep up with toll
increases," said Michael Leahy, the agency's director of toll
operations. "This should tighten things up."</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Corridor Agencies, based in Irvine, operates
the Foothill, Eastern, and San Joaquin Hills toll roads. Included in
the system is a short stretch of Laguna Canyon Road. When a vehicle
is identified passing a toll gate without paying, a notice is sent to
the registered owner. If the notice is ignored, the penalties double
to $50 from $25.</LD>
<TE>   The operations and finance committee for the San Joaquin Hills
toll road unanimously recommended raising fines and processing fees
to $30 from $25 per violation. The changes would increase the maximum
penalty to $60 for each unpaid toll.</TE>
<TE>   By charging toll-booth runners higher penalties, Leahy estimated
the collection of tolls and penalties could increase by $1 million to
$1.5million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by a growing tendency of motorists to speed through toll
plazas without paying, transit officials began to beef up enforcement
in December 2000. At the time, roughly half the scofflaws could not
be identified by cameras, and unpaid tolls and fines mounted.</TE>
<TE>   Some motorists were so brazen they placed towels over their
license plates or stationed accomplices in their trunks who stuck
their arms out to block the plates from the view of cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the transit agency has raised fines, added dozens of
video cameras to photograph violators and created a special team to
track down repeated offenders. The California Highway Patrol has
increased patrols.</TE>
<TE>   The transit agency replaced its primary enforcement contractor,
Lockheed Martin IMS, which used to reimburse the agencies for lost
tolls whenever enforcement cameras failed to identify violators.
Transit officials complained the video images of cheaters were often
so poor or fuzzy they could not read license-plate numbers, leaving
no clue whom to fine. A variety of new contractors, offering higher
collection rates, has since been hired.</TE>
<TE>   The transit agency reduced the amount of outstanding tolls from a
high of $2.85 million in 2000 to $1.7 million in 2001. Last year,
violations involved 1.2% of traffic, compared with 3% in 1999. At one
time, the system's rate of toll cheating was double the national
average.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the higher fines, committee members recommended a $2
administrative fee per transaction be imposed on FasTrak subscribers
if their transponders fail to register tolls because of driver error,
such as leaving the device in a glove box or another vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The operations and finance committee for the Foothill-Eastern toll
road is expected to approve the fines and fees today. Next week, the
boards of directors for both Foothill-Eastern and the San Joaquin
Hills will decide whether to put the changes into effect.</TE>

<LD>Trying to reduce its high rate of toll cheaters, the operators of
Orange County's largest turnpike system on Tuesday proposed that
fines and processing fees be increased for motorists who refuse to
pay.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendations are part of an 18-month effort by the Orange
County Transportation Corridor Agencies to improve toll enforcement
throughout the authority's 51-mile network of highways.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to close the gap in our losses and make sure fines keep
up with toll increases," said Michael Leahy, TCA's director of toll
operations.</LD>
<TE>   "This should tighten things up."</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Corridor Agencies, based in Irvine, operates
the Foothill, Eastern, and San Joaquin Hills toll roads.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the system is a short stretch of Laguna Canyon Road.
When a vehicle is identified passing a toll gate without paying, a
notice is sent to the registered owner.</TE>
<TE>   If the notice is ignored, the penalties double to $50 from $25.</TE>
<TE>   The operations and finance committee for the San Joaquin Hills
toll road unanimously recommended TCA raise both fines and processing
fees to $30 from $25 per violation.</TE>
<TE>   The changes would increase the maximum penalty to $60 for each
unpaid toll.</TE>
<TE>   By charging toll-booth runners higher penalties, Leahy estimated,
the collection of tolls and penalties could increase by $1 million to
$1.5million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by a growing tendency of motorists to speed through toll
plazas without paying, TCA officials began to beef up enforcement in
December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, roughly half the scofflaws could not be identified by
cameras, and unpaid tolls and fines mounted.</TE>
<TE>   Some motorists were so brazen that they placed towels over their
license plates or stationed accomplices in their trunks who stuck
their arms out to block the plates from the view of cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, TCA has raised fines, added dozens of video cameras to
photograph violators and created a special team to track down repeat
offenders.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol has increased patrols.</TE>
<TE>   TCA replaced its primary enforcement contractor, Lockheed Martin
IMS, which used to reimburse the agencies for lost tolls whenever
enforcement cameras failed to identify violators.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials complained that the video images of cheaters were
often so poor or fuzzy that they could not make out license-plate
numbers, leaving no clue whom to fine.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of new contractors, offering higher collection rates,
has since been hired.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA has reduced the amount of outstanding tolls from a high of
$2.85 million in 2000 to $1.7million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, violations involved 1.2% of traffic, compared to 3% in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, the system's rate of toll cheating was double the
national average.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the higher fines, committee members recommended a $2
administrative fee per transaction be imposed on FasTrak subscribers
if their transponders fail to register tolls because of driver error,
such as leaving the device in a glove box or another vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Mounted on dashboards or windshields, transponders automatically
record tolls on a motorist's account.</TE>
<TE>   "The fees are intended to discourage repeat violators and to
encourage customers to properly mount their transponders," Leahy
said.</TE>
<TE>   The operations and finance committee for the Foothill-Eastern toll
road is expected to approve the fines and fees today.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the boards of directors for both the Foothill-Eastern
and the San Joaquin Hills tollways will decide whether to put the
changes into effect.</TE>

<LD>Two masked gunmen robbed a 24-hour Ralph's supermarket in Port
Hueneme early Tuesday, taking an undisclosed amount of money, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   One of the robbers held a gun to a stock clerk's chest until a
store manager handed over cash from a register, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The robbery occurred about at 5:30 a.m. in the 600 block of West
Channel Islands Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   The men fled in a silver or blue 1980s compact car, possibly a
Honda. One robber was wearing a black ski mask and the other had a
blue-and-white bandanna covering his face.</TE>
<TE>   Police were investigating whether the robbers might also be
responsible for several holdups over the weekend in Oxnard.</TE>

<LD>A 14-year-old girl shot three times last month after allegedly moving
toward a Ventura police officer with a kitchen knife was charged
Tuesday with a felony, a prosecutor said.</LD>
<LD>   The girl was shot May 5 inside her Ventura foster home. The
juvenile will be arraigned today on one count of assaulting a peace
officer, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Miles Weiss said.</LD>
<LD>   After recovering, the girl, described by police as mentally
troubled, was sent to Juvenile Hall. Weiss said his office wants to
see the girl placed in a rehabilitation facility and not a juvenile
jail.</LD>

<HD>Elite Unit Joins Attack on Ojai Fire</HD>
<DH>Los Padres: Blaze has charred 7,500 acres over four days,
with only 15% under containment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A raging wildfire charged over mountain peaks north of Ojai on
Tuesday and swept through heavily wooded areas, while an elite
firefighting team arrived to take over the battle to control the
7,500-acre blaze.</LD>
<LD>   Crews specially trained in battling high-mountain brush fires
arrived by bus throughout the day, while water-dropping helicopters
and tanker planes continued their air assault on the swift-moving
fire.</LD>
<LD>   Despite their efforts, the blaze dubbed the Wolf fire continued to
burn out of control in a large swath of Los Padres National Forest
south of Lockwood Valley Road and east of California 33. The
4-day-old fire clouded skies and sent ash raining down on much of
Ventura County. By nightfall, the blaze was only 15% contained.</LD>
<TE>   From highway turnouts, fire crews on break watched as the blaze
erupted on five separate fronts Tuesday afternoon, with 20-mph winds
pushing flames eastward along steep hillsides in the Sespe
Wilderness, about 12 miles from the California Condor Sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire terrain has been very difficult," said Jim Smith,
division chief for Los Padres National Forest. "We're not going to be
putting people out in front of the flames."</TE>
<TE>   No one has been injured in the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the 44-member crew from the California Interagency
Management Team spent the day working alongside Smith and others who
mapped out the initial firefighting plan.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the special firefighting team, one of five in California
and 16 across the country, will begin figuring out a new strategy to
contain the wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters in the unit come from several state and local
agencies and have received training in how to battle large-scale
wildfires in dangerous terrain, officials said. The unit is part of a
larger national wildfire planning team based in Boise, Idaho, said
Kris Fister, a spokeswoman for the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We are used to dealing with fires that are more complex and have
complex management issues," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of the unit came as more than 1,500 firefighters
continued to attack the fire, with flames coming within three miles
of several homes in the Howard Creek area north of Rose Valley. There
have been no orders to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopters scooped water from ponds in Rose Valley and the
Matilija Dam, while a squadron of tanker planes spent much of the day
flying through a thick cloud of smoke, dropping water and flame
retardant along the 7,000-foot Pine Mountain Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   On the ground, hand crews, hampered by temperatures close to 100
degrees, used pickaxes and shovels to clear paths on the north and
south perimeters of the fire. The day before, bulldozers plowed a
trail along Dry Lake Ridge to stop the fire from advancing south
toward Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, which has already cost firefighting agencies more than
$543,000, started Saturday near Wolf Grill Restaurant off California
33, about 12 miles north of Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   A team of fire investigators has been unable to determine the
cause.</TE>
<TE>   The fire has charred thickets of brush and pine that had not
burned in 70 years. It has spewed ash as far east as Thousand Oaks
and cast a thick haze of brown and orange smoke over much of Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hazy skies and falling ash, county officials said the
air is not considered unhealthful unless the smell of smoke is
present.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our understanding that the smoke is not in our communities,"
said Doug Tubbs of the Ventura County Air Pollution District. "The
general cautionary note is that if smoke [is present] in the air,
then you should curtail outdoor activities."</TE>

<DH>The Lakers aren't just battling the Nets, they're fighting
to be considered among franchise's best all-time</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers' opponents in these NBA Finals aren't the New Jersey Nets.</LD>
<LD>   They're engaged in a battle with history. And they're up against
... the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   The rafters, attics and shelves of this franchise are so crowded
that it's hard to find room for something new. But if the Lakers beat
the Nets and win a third consecutive championship, they could at
least gain a spot at the discussion table when it's time to talk
about the great Laker teams of all time.</LD>
<TE>   It wouldn't be a first for the franchise. The Minneapolis Lakers
of the George Mikan era won three straight from 1952-1954.</TE>
<TE>   And even if these Lakers win this, they would still need at least
two more championships in the next seven years to establish this as
their decade, the way Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls owned the 1990s
and the Lakers owned the '80s and Bill Russell's Celtics held sway in
the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   But Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant could claim a three-peat,
something not even the Showtime crew of Magic Johnson and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar could manage.</TE>
<TE>   If they do?</TE>
<TE>   "It ranks up there with our great teams," Johnson said. "The
[Larry] Birds, all the guys who had great teams. They'll be up there
with all the rest of them."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are never far from the past. It hangs over their heads
on the western wall of Staples Center, in the fabric of those giant
championship banners and retired jerseys. It sits on the baseline,
next to their bench, in the person of Johnson. Tuesday it was even
draped over Bryant's body in the form of a Jerry West throwback
jersey.</TE>
<TE>   The 1971-72 Lakers of West and Wilt Chamberlain set a standard of
single-season excellence, with 69 regular-season victories (topped by
the Chicago Bulls in 1995-96) and a record 33 consecutive victories
that still stands as the longest winning streak in professional
sports.</TE>
<TE>   These Lakers made a run at both of those numbers two years ago,
back when they still took interest in the regular season. They won 67
games in 1999-2000, 19 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   And no other team put together a 15-1 run like the Lakers had in
last year's playoffs. They also started a string of 12 consecutive
road playoff victories, an NBA record that lasted until Sacramento
beat them in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals this year.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest knock against the Lakers is that there haven't
been enough teams like the Kings to seriously challenge them.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, are they playing against the same level of
competition?" said Quinn Buckner, who beat the Lakers as a member of
the Boston Celtics in the 1984 NBA Finals and is providing game
commentary for ESPN radio in this series. "The facts are, they can't
change the level of competition they're playing against."</TE>
<TE>   Every NBA Finals the Lakers played from 1983 on featured an
opponent with at least two future Hall of Fame players at or near
their primes.</TE>
<TE>   The 1983 Philadelphia 76er squad that swept the Lakers had Julius
Erving and Moses Malone (both enshrined in Springfield), besides
Maurice Cheeks. The Celtics from 1984-87 had Bird (Hall class of
1998), Kevin McHale (1999) and Robert Parish, with Bill Walton (class
of '93) coming off the bench in 1986 and '87.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Pistons, whom the Lakers beat in 1988 to win the only
consecutive championships of the Showtime era, had 2000 inductee
Isiah Thomas, plus Joe Dumars, who figures to get in.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the Pistons denied the Lakers their shot at a three-peat
in a series that Laker fans remember for the hamstring injuries that
cost them the services of Johnson and Byron Scott.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that we would have definitely done it," said Johnson,
whose team won every game in the first three playoff rounds that
year. "That year we were going for it. We were playing the best ball
we had ever played."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said, "I think, no matter if we had [the three-peat] or not,
we still know we probably had the best team in the history of the
game."</TE>
<TE>   These Lakers are still fighting just to be recognized as the best
team in the history of the Lakers. Their matchup against the 1980s'
Lakers is a battle of quality vs. quality and quantity.</TE>
<TE>   "Showtime was the real deal," Buckner said. "You've got elite
players on both teams, but they had more on that team. You've got
Magic, Kareem and James Worthy. You've got Kobe and Shaq here.</TE>
<TE>   "They had Norm Nixon and [then] get Byron Scott. They were, in my
opinion, a much tougher team to play against."</TE>
<TE>   At various times in the 1980s, the Laker reserves included a
former MVP and a future Hall of Famer (Bob McAdoo) and a former No. 1
overall draft pick (Mychal Thompson), not to mention defensive ace
Michael Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   New collective bargaining agreements, more restrictive salary cap
rules and now the threat of the luxury tax have made it more
difficult to amass such talent. And six teams have joined the league
since the Showtime Lakers won their last championship in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it extremely difficult to compare teams of different
eras," said Kurt Rambis, a power forward on the championship teams of
1982, '85, '87 and '88 and now a Laker assistant coach. "The number
of teams that have come into the league since the '80s, in some
respects has diluted the talent. You have the rule changes that
effect things. I think it does both teams in different eras an
injustice to try to say that one is better than the other."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal boiled the mythical matchup down to one issue: "Who is
going to guard me?"</TE>
<TE>   Good question. But surely Abdul-Jabbar, the league's all-time
leading scorer, would manage his share of points. And Johnson, who
deserves a spot next to Jordan in the league's all-time backcourt,
would find a way to exert his will on the game, as he always did.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper would have been as good a defensive answer as you could
hope to find against Bryant. And the current supporting cast of Rick
Fox, Derek Fisher, Robert Horry, Brian Shaw and Samaki Walker would
have had a hard time keeping up with the scoring pace of Worthy,
Scott, A.C. Green, McAdoo/Thompson and Co., especially if the Lakers
had their fastbreak game in full gear. The 1986-87 team had seven
players who averaged 10 or more points.</TE>
<TE>   Who could stop whom?</TE>
<TE>   As Johnson said, "They would have done nothing with us, we
couldn't do nothing with them."</TE>
<TE>   Rambis said, "We didn't have anybody offensively who could do what
Kobe did. We didn't have anybody that had the physical dominance that
Shaq brings. But we may have been better overall, talent-wise, like
the comparison [between] Sacramento to us [now]. But you've seen that
doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have plenty of threats on their roster, but they don't
have as many all-time great players as the 1980s Lakers. And after
Mike Bibby, they didn't have enough players willing and able to do it
in crunch time.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't prevent the Kings from locking the Lakers into a
classic series. And like the other memorable series from this current
run, Portland two years ago, it came in the Western Conference
finals.</TE>
<TE>   "The only difference between us and them, we had to go through
people like Detroit, the Celtics in the finals," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The current Lakers have beaten the 76ers and the Indiana Pacers in
the NBA Finals, teams that could boast only two marquee
players--Allen Iverson and Reggie Miller--between them.</TE>
<TE>   Same thing with the Nets. It's Jason Kidd and ... the guys who
play with Jason Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   As Bryant said Tuesday, the Nets don't have a 1-2 punch.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what a third consecutive championship would do for
their place in history, though, the Laker stars tried to stay focused
on the task at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Bryant said. "Hopefully, I'll let you know when we
do it. It's definitely motivating for me. Right now, I'm not thinking
about the past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about this one right here."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said, "I don't like to think too far ahead. The first team
to win four games."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, everyone expects the Lakers to get to four first,
without much extra time.</TE>
<TE>   That's the quandary for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   For them to show their true greatness, they need to play teams
that beat them in the finals.</TE>
<TE>   They need to play a team like the Lakers, the ones who wore the
shorter shorts, but at least didn't have trouble keeping them on.</TE>

<HD>Twins Tag Indians With a 23-2 Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their lineup finally sound, the Minnesota Twins showed the
Cleveland Indians what they're capable of.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Rivas came off the disabled list and went four for six with
five runs scored and five runs batted in as the Twins posted their
most lopsided win, 23-2, over the Indians on Tuesday night at
Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Jacque Jones had four hits and five RBIs, Dustan Mohr was four for
six with a two-run homer and A.J. Pierzynski also was four for six
for the Twins, who set a franchise record with 25 hits and missed
their runs record by one.</LD>
<TE>   "It was just a good game, especially with the way Cleveland's been
playing," said Pierzynski, who missed the cycle by a home run. "It
was nice to send a message."</TE>
<TE>   The Indians, who arrived with a four-game winning streak and eight
victories in their last 10 games after a 9-25 stretch, gave up more
than 20 runs for the second time this season.</TE>
<TE>   They also matched the most lopsided loss in history--21-0 to
Detroit on Sept. 15, 1901, was the last time it happened--and missed
giving up their most runs ever by one. Boston scored 24 against them
on Aug. 21, 1986.</TE>
<TE>   New York 13, Baltimore 5--Jason Giambi hit a three-run homer
during the Yankees' eight-run sixth inning at New York as the team
hit four home runs in the victory over the Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi hit a two-run double in the first and had his 16th home run
in the sixth. Alfonso Soriano, Robin Ventura and Rondell White also
homered for the Yankees, who lead the majors with 96 homers in 59
games.</TE>
<TE>   With the Orioles leading, 5-4, the Yankees broke the game open in
the sixth. With the bases loaded, Derek Jeter hit a two-run single to
knock out Scott Erickson (3-6).</TE>
<TE>   Boston 10, Detroit 5--Johnny Damon and Shea Hillenbrand had four
hits each, and Carlos Baerga drove in four runs as the Red Sox won at
Detroit to improve to 23-6 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Damon doubled twice and hit his fourth home run in going four for
five after going three for four Monday night. He also scored four
runs, and Baerga had an RBI single and a three-run double.</TE>
<TE>   John Burkett gave up four runs in the first two innings but
settled down to match teammate Pedro Martinez at 7-0 on the season.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, Tampa Bay 1--Eric Hinske homered twice, and fellow
rookie Justin Miller pitched seven innings and gave up only three
hits at Toronto as the Blue Jays won their season-high fifth in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays won their second in a row under new Manager Carlos
Tosca. Buck Martinez was fired Monday after Toronto swept Detroit
last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Hinske gave Toronto a 2-0 lead in the fifth with a home run off
Paul Wilson (2-4), who pitched the first complete game of his career.
Hinske's 11th homer in the eighth made it 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 3 , Chicago 2--Miguel Asencio got his first major
league victory as the Royals defeated the White Sox at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Asencio, making his third career start, pitched 61/3 innings. He
gave up one run and four hits with two walks and two strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 3, Seattle 2--Terrence Long hit a game-winning double in
the bottom of the 10th inning at Oakland as the Athletics defeated
the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Dye walked, and an out later Eric Piatt singled off
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (3-1). Long then knocked his double off the wall
in center field.</TE>

<HD>Schoeneweis All Angels Need</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He shuts down the Rangers, 3-0, as Anaheim keeps
rolling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you're not pitching well, everyone has a word of advice. Your
manager has a couple ideas. Your pitching coach wants to help. Your
teammates chime in. The talk shows and chat-room forums overflow with
suggestions, even if most of those involve your removal from the
starting rotation.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Schoeneweis even imagined his son pointing out his faults.
His son turns 30 today--30 days old, that is.</LD>
<LD>   "I can tell," he said with a chuckle. "Some of his grunts and
groans are like, hey, get your act together and start pitching, Dad."</LD>
<TE>   Schoeneweis could afford to smile Tuesday, after a brilliant
performance that left his manager, pitching coach and teammates
smiling too. He got all but one out of the Angels' 3-0 victory over
the Texas Rangers, stifling a potent lineup on four hits and never
allowing a runner past second base.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels climbed within two games of first place in the American
League West and climbed 11 games over .500 for the first time in four
years.</TE>
<TE>   After eight innings, Schoeneweis returned to the mound in search
of a shutout, serenaded by a warm ovation. He got Alex Rodriguez. He
got Rafael Palmeiro. On a full count, he walked Juan Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   And, after a season-high 125 pitches, he was done. As closer Troy
Percival jogged in from the bullpen, television cameras captured
Schoeneweis visibly annoyed on the bench. He was upset, he said
later, not with Manager Mike Scioscia for removing him, but with
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing you can do in that ninth inning is walk a guy,"
Schoeneweis said.</TE>
<TE>   Percival got the final out, retiring Todd Greene for his third
save in three days and 11th of the season. Percival nudged himself
into the record book as well, tying Chuck Finley for the most
appearances (436) in Angel history.</TE>
<TE>   But the game belonged to Schoeneweis, who beat the powerful
Rangers for the second time this season.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't overstate how dangerous that lineup is," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "He has good pitches," Greene said. "When he has command of them,
he can beat any team, not just us."</TE>
<TE>   He threw first-pitch strikes to 21 of 32 batters. He pounded his
fastball inside. He used his sinker and change-up effectively,
getting 11 outs on ground balls and another four on pop flies.</TE>
<TE>   In short, he did everything the Angels have asked him to do, this
season and in the preceding two. The Angels' home-grown
starters--Schoeneweis, Jarrod Washburn and Ramon Ortriz--are in their
third full season.</TE>
<TE>   "Washburn and Ramon have improved by leaps and bounds. I've been
bringing up the caboose," Schoeneweis said. "I need to pick up the
slack and keep up my end of the bargain."</TE>
<TE>   If it doesn't happen in three years, perhaps it won't.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels offered long-term contracts this spring to Washburn and
Ortiz, but not to Schoeneweis. After four starts, he had three losses
and a 7.33 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   But he has reached the seventh inning in eight of 11 starts. He
has not lost in his last five starts. His record is 4-4, his ERA a
respectable 4.77.</TE>
<TE>   And, for all the hollering about replacing him in the rotation, he
is a fifth starter. The Angels are in no hurry to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   After all, even the teams perceived to have the best rotations in
the league struggle to find five top starters.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland A's sent their fifth starter, Erik Hiljus, to the
minor leagues. The New York Yankees use Ted Lilly as their fifth
starter; he has reached the seventh inning four times in eight
starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did not crush the ball in this game, but they were
opportunistic.</TE>
<TE>   They had a modest seven hits, but four were for extra bases, and
they were three for six with runners in scoring position. Garret
Anderson doubled twice; he leads the league in doubles.</TE>
<TE>   But the most impressive statistic may be this: Schoeneweis is 3-0
since the birth of his son.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we'll keep it going, and he'll be proud of the old
man," he said.</TE>

<HD>Pitching Is Focus of Team's Draft</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the July trading deadline creeps closer, with the Angels emerging
as a playoff contender, General Manager Bill Stoneman might well
consider trading prospects to acquire a power hitter, starting
pitcher or veteran reliever. The most valuable commodity in the sport
is young pitching, and scouting director Donny Rowland did his part
to help Stoneman by stocking up on more in Tuesday's draft.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Spiezio has two home runs, the fewest of any American League
first baseman with 100 or more at-bats. If the Angels decide to trade
for a power-hitting first baseman, they already have pitching
prospects aplenty, including Chris Bootcheck, Bobby Jenks, John
Lackey, Francisco Rodriguez, Joe Torres and Matt Wise.</LD>
<LD>   "If you're a team people see as having a boatload of pitching, you
can go out and get your position player," Rowland said.</LD>
<TE>   So, although the Angels are strong in pitching prospects and weak
in hitting prospects, Rowland selected pitchers with the top three
draft picks Tuesday. The Angels also signed two fifth-year college
seniors ineligible for the draft but considered by the team as the
equivalent of two additional selections in the first five rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' top pick, Virginia Tech left-hander Joe Saunders, said
scouts had compared him to Tom Glavine and Eric Milton. But Saunders'
polish, exceptional command and finesse style also evoke comparison
to Brian Anderson, whom the Angels selected in the first round of the
1993 draft. He made his major league debut that year and established
himself as a fine No. 3 or No. 4 starter, if not an ace.</TE>
<TE>   Saunders likely will sign for a bonus in the range of $2.2 million
to $2.4 million. The Angels considered selecting left-hander Scott
Kazmir, a projected top five pick who slipped past them at No. 12 to
the New York Mets at No. 15, but decided Saunders was almost as good
and would sign for about half of Kazmir's asking price.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Rijo is out of the Cincinnati Reds' rotation again, and it's
unclear if he'll ever get back in it.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old pitcher, who overcame five major elbow operations,
will go back in the bullpen for a while, Manager Bob Boone said
Tuesday. He gave no indication whether it's a long-term move.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know the answer to that," Boone said.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of Rijo starting Saturday in Anaheim, right-hander Carlos
Almanzar will make his first major league start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis right-hander Garrett Stephenson aggravated his sore left
hamstring and was put on the 15-day disabled list. The team recalled
left-hander Bud Smith from triple-A Memphis .... The Texas Rangers
put right-handed reliever Rudy Seanez on the disabled list because of
right shoulder tendinitis and recalled Joaquin Benoit from triple-A
Oklahoma.... Toronto Blue Jay pitching coach Mark Conner left the
team before Tuesday's game to ponder whether he wants to remain with
the club after manager Buck Martinez was fired Monday.</TE>

<HD>Workout Traffic Doesn't Seem to Bother War Emblem</HD>

<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Before the 8 a.m. workout, under a hot Kentucky sun that had already
shot the temperature up near the 80-degree mark, trainer Bob Baffert
was sweating more than War Emblem.</LD>
<LD>   When Jim Barnes, Baffert's assistant, and his wife Dana came on
the track at Churchill Downs on Tuesday, the silver-haired trainer
was stationed in his usual spot, high in the grandstand with a
two-way radio in one hand and a stopwatch in the other. Jim Barnes,
aboard Cisco, a butterscotch-colored stable pony, was escorting
exercise rider Dana Barnes and War Emblem to the starting point for a
five-furlong workout.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of other horses were on the track. Baffert fretted.</LD>
<TE>   "This place was a ghost town for days," he said. "Now everybody
here is training his horse."</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem didn't seem to mind. The long-striding ink-black colt,
winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness and eligible to become
racing's first Triple Crown winner in 24 years when he runs in the
Belmont Stakes on Saturday, finished the drill in 1:01.</TE>
<TE>   "Perfect," Baffert said to Dana Barnes on the two-way, then
turning to reporters he added:</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to get it on. He was going to go in :59 if we had let
him. He's ready. He's like a cruise missile. Stealth. You can't hear
him when he glides over the track."</TE>
<TE>   The fractional splits for the workout were :121/5, :241/5, :362/5
and :481/5. Baffert caught the colt galloping out an extra furlong in
1:143/5.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, along with three other Belmont horses, will be flown
to New York this morning, but all of his important training has come
at Churchill Downs. Baffert employed the same method for his other
Triple Crown threats, Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in 1998.
They both finished second in the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures in Louisville have been in the 90s for several days,
with high humidity. The New York forecast for race day is no rain,
partly cloudy and temperatures in the 70s.</TE>
<TE>   "The heat hasn't bothered him that much," Baffert said. "He's
still full of himself. On Monday, when a lot of horses were in their
stalls, trying to get relief from fans, this horse came out bucking
for his gallop. He's one tough hombre."</TE>
<TE>   At entry time today, 12 horses are expected. Also running will be
Artax Too, Essence Of Dubai, Like A Hero, Magic Weisner, Medaglia
d'Oro, Perfect Drift, Proud Citizen, Puzzlement, Sarava, Sunday Break
and Wiseman's Ferry. "Everything's a go," Baffert said. "We'll send
him up there, hope he draws a decent hole [post position] and then
keep our fingers crossed."</TE>

<LD>Columnist Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News was not impressed by
Sacramento forward Chris Webber in Game 7 of the NBA's Western
Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   "The Lakers make the NBA Finals more interesting by being there
again, certainly more interesting than they would have been with
Webber, who made no baskets down the stretch in regulation and one in
overtime. Webber is about as much a $100-million ballplayer as Allan
Houston is.</LD>
<LD>   "Webber also committed the unforgivable basketball sin of getting
called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter. Of Game 7. It
means he pulled the same kind of rock he did when he called a timeout
his Michigan team didn't have in an NCAA championship game. When it
was all on the line, he wasn't in Shaquille O'Neal's class, or Kobe
Bryant's."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Lupica: "The Lakers are a great team, maybe the best in the
NBA since the old Lakers of Magic and Kareem and James Worthy.</TE>
<TE>   "These Lakers would have given Jordan's Bulls all they wanted,
believe me. And Kobe would have given Jordan all he wanted. There are
still people who act insulted when you even put Kobe in the same
conversation with No. 23. They need to get over that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which major league baseball player holds the record
for the highest single-season batting average in his last season
(minimum 100 games)?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clip and save: Quarterback Jay Fiedler has thrown 34 touchdown
passes and 33 interceptions in two seasons with the Miami Dolphins.
But that doesn't stop Miami Herald columnist Edwin Pope from
predicting great things for Fiedler:</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be Jay Fiedler's breakout season as a Dolphin
quarterback.... Fiedler will be superior. Not just adequate.
Superior.</TE>
<TE>   "He might still have to convince most of South Florida starting in
September. Not me. I'm sold."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Call 1-900-PHIL: Ailene Voisin in the Sacramento Bee: "What was it
Phil Jackson said during Lakers' practice on Saturday? That if Shaq
was successful at the foul line in the deciding seventh game of the
Western Conference finals, 'We're home.'?</TE>
<TE>   "Great. The Zen Master is clairvoyant now too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anger management: Some Phoenix fans were irritated by the insults
directed by Jason Kidd at Suns' bigwigs, who traded Kidd to New
Jersey before the season. Arizona Republic columnist Dan Bickley has
a soothing solution.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're mad at Kidd for his continuing assault on Suns'
management, try to understand. What if your boss shipped you to New
Jersey?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, banned from baseball in his
prime because of the Black Sox scandal, batted .382 for Chicago in
1920.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Maybe columnist Caulton Tudor of the Raleigh News &amp;
Observer is onto something. He picked the Carolina Hurricanes to beat
favored Detroit in six games for the Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all sorts of reasons the Carolina Hurricanes are going
to win," Tudor writes.</TE>
<TE>   "There's defense, goaltending, momentum, experience and youth. But
first and foremost, the Hurricanes simply have to rate as the best
team in the National Hockey League right now."</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes, the lowest-scoring team to reach the Stanley Cup
finals, won Game 1, 3-2, on Tuesday in overtime.</TE>

<HD>Quick-Striking Costa Rica Spoils China's Debut in Cup, 2-0</HD>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Costa Rica scored two goals in a four-minute span in the second half
Tuesday to secure a 2-0 victory and spoil China's World Cup debut in
front of 27,217 fans, including 15,000 Chinese, at Gwangju, South
Korea.</LD>
<LD>   After battling for an hour to break down China's stubborn defense,
the Central Americans finally took the lead in the 61st minute when
Ronald Gomez beat goalkeeper Jiang Jin with a curling shot from
inside the penalty area.</LD>
<LD>   Four minutes later, Gomez beat a defender on the edge of the area
and crossed the ball for Mauricio Wright to head downward past Jiang.</LD>
<TE>   China Coach Bora Milutinovic, who had coached Costa Rica into the
second round of the Italy '90 World Cup, was philosophical afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "We played well but it wasn't enough," he said. "What can you do
if you lose a game like this? They had two kicks at the goal and
scored two goals. But if you cannot accept that, you should not be at
the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Ma Mingyu, the Chinese captain, said Milutinovic had warned that
Costa Rica could strike suddenly.</TE>
<TE>   "It is disappointing that their two goals came so quickly
together," Ma said. "The coach told us beforehand that Costa Rica
plays in short spurts, and in the end that was the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to stay focused for 90 minutes, but we lost it
[concentration] in the second half."</TE>

<LD>They thronged. They watched. They groaned.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of Chinese gathered around televisions Tuesday in bars,
at home and on sidewalks to see their country's first World Cup
appearance--and to lament the 2-0 loss to tiny Costa Rica.</LD>
<LD>   "That stunk. We have no hope," said a store clerk who was in a
crowd of 100 people watching a giant-screen television outside a
Beijing shopping mall. She would give only her surname, Huang.</LD>
<TE>   "I was just hoping for a draw. I know we're no soccer power," Ceng
Jiaxin, a 29-year-old furniture store employee, said after the game.
"I had hoped they would look better."</TE>
<TE>   Some were more philosophical. Wang Yihong, a 36-year-old manager
at a souvenir factory, said even a poor showing would give the
players valuable experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It really isn't easy to play against the world's best," he said.
"China's level just isn't high enough."</TE>

<LD>After England tied Sweden, 1-1, on Sunday, it wasn't surprising that
newspapers in London reacted with their usual pessimism.</LD>
<LD>   "Half-hearted, half-fit and halfway home," the headline in the
Guardian newspaper said.</LD>
<LD>   "Play like that and we're OUT," the Sun tabloid read.</LD>
<TE>   Fellow tabloid, the Mirror was equally critical of the high hopes
attached to the England squad.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe there should be a government health warning attached to
every England squad going to a major tournament," it wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "The addiction is as great as any drug, although at least with
alcohol or tobacco the high does not end halfway through the first
taste. But the lows are deep, the pain of withdrawal as bitter and
agonizing, and the cost for the thousands who came to Saitama in

<HD>Late Wake Up for Dodger Offense</HD>
<DH>Baseball: L.A. scores six runs in ninth inning of 10-4 win
over Colorado to move into first-place tie with Arizona.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Yogi Berra would have loved this one. It really was deja vu all over
again.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Karros snapped a tie score with a bases-loaded, two-run
single in the top of the ninth, and Adrian Beltre capped a six-run
outburst with a three-run home run to lift the Dodgers to a 10-4
victory over the Colorado Rockies before 30,195 in Coors Field on
Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   It was a near copy of the Dodgers' five-run ninth Monday night,
when Karros hit a bases-loaded, two-run single and Beltre hit a
three-run homer to help the Dodgers pull away for an 11-5 win over
Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers have won seven of eight games, are in a first-place
tie with Arizona in the NL West and will go for a three-game sweep of
the Rockies today.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a tough [10-9] loss in Arizona [on May 26] and that could
have sent us into a tailspin," said Karros, who has knocked in nine
runs in his last three games, "but we've been playing well of late."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, they've been playing very well late. The Dodger offense
scored four runs in the eighth inning and five in the ninth Monday
night, and they took over again in the ninth Tuesday night after
former Dodger Todd Hollandsworth's solo home run off reliever
Giovanni Carrara pulled the Rockies even, 4-4, in the bottom of the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts opened the ninth with a pinch-hit double, and Cesar
Izturis, who was pulled in the bottom of the ninth because of a sore
left hip and is questionable for today's game, bunted Roberts to
third.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado looked like it might escape the jam when Paul Lo Duca,
attempting to back away from a Todd Jones inside fastball,
inadvertently tapped a weak grounder to third for the second out.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green was walked intentionally, and Brian Jordan walked on a
full-count pitch to load the bases. Karros fell behind, 0-and-2, but
after fouling off one pitch, he stroked a two-run single to
right-center for a 6-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't throw a wild pitch, and he can't miss inside, because if
he hits me, a run scores," Karros said. "So even though it's 0-2, you
have to feel like you have the advantage. As a hitter, with two
strikes, you're just trying to hit the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom's RBI single made it 7-4, and Beltre, who tripled
and scored on Mark Grudzielanek's single in the fourth inning,
launched his sixth homer of the season an estimated 442 feet to
left-center for a 10-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have any better at-bats than we had in the top of the
ninth inning," Manager Jim Tracy said. "The gratifying thing is none
of those were easy at-bats."</TE>
<TE>   Karros, who is batting .352 with runners in scoring position,
seems to have nothing but good at-bats in Coors Field. He has a
lifetime .373 average with 19 homers and 54 RBIs here.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who struggled offensively for the first six weeks of
the season, have scored 117 runs in the last 18 games, an average of
6.5 a game, and they've reached double figures in runs in 11 of the
last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   With Beltre's ninth-inning shot, the Dodgers have homered in a
season-high 12 consecutive games, slugging 24 homers during that
span. They hit 22 home runs in their first 40 games.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Hideo Nomo was hit hard Tuesday night but gave up
only three runs and 11 hits in seven innings. Reliever Jesse Orosco,

<HD>Doctors Still Unsure How to Treat Brown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown, suffering from a herniated disk in his lower back,
remained hospitalized at Centinela Medical Center in Inglewood on
Tuesday while doctors considered courses for treatment--among them,
possible season-ending surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, already on the disabled list because of inflammation in the
back of his surgically-repaired right elbow, might have sustained the
injury while playfully wrestling with one of his sons at home last
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy said Brown's son was about to fall off a bed
when Brown lunged to catch him.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a quick, reactionary motion to grab his son, and that may
have triggered [the back injury]," Tracy said. "The situation
worsened, he had an MRI test Thursday, and that revealed the
protrusion."</TE>
<TE>   Brown was in excruciating pain Monday, but Tracy said the pain had
subsided considerably after an injection of medication. Brown was
examined by Frank Jobe, team physician, and spinal specialist Dr.
William Dillin on Tuesday, but he did not undergo any tests.</TE>
<TE>   He'll probably remain hospitalized until tonight or Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just resting [Tuesday]," team trainer Stan Johnston said.
"The first thing was to break the pain cycle. We'll see how he comes
out of this and determine in the next couple of days what to do."</TE>
<TE>   There are two primary options for treating a herniated disk--a
physical therapy program designed to strengthen the lower-back area
through exercise, or surgery, most likely a laser diskectomy, in
which a laser beam is used to cut out or evaporate the protrusion.</TE>
<TE>   A rehabilitation program would probably sideline Brown for another
month or so. Surgery would probably sideline him for at least two
months, and possibly the season, but it would also go a long way
toward ensuring Brown's long-term health, a major factor considering
Brown, 37, is owed another $45 million from 2003-2005 and has been on
the disabled list five times in the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, no one has told me he could be out of the season,"
Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't speculate. I don't guess. There's no doubt about the
impact he has when healthy, but since [the beginning of 2001], all
I've seen are little bits and pieces of [the real] Kevin Brown, and
that's unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Two prominent pitchers underwent back surgery in recent years,
with favorable results. Randy Johnson missed the final five weeks of
the 1996 season because of a herniated disk, had surgery, and
returned to go 20-4 with a 2.28 earned-run average and 291 strikeouts
for Seattle in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Wells had surgery to repair two herniated disks last July 17
and missed the remainder of the season, but he has a 6-2 record and
3.66 ERA in 11 starts for the New York Yankees this season. Arizona
center fielder Steve Finley had diskectomy after the 2000 season and
returned at full strength in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have a capable replacement for Brown in left-hander
Omar Daal, but losing Brown for the season--or even an extended
period--would deal a considerable blow to their pennant hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a good pitching staff, but we need Brownie because he's
the horse," left-hander Odalis Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's gone to the playoffs and World Series. He knows what it
takes."</TE>
<TE>   In making a decision, the Dodgers must weigh the present--their
need for Brown this season--against the future. They'd miss Brown if
he sat out a few months this season, but the absence would give
Brown's elbow, which has already endured two setbacks this season,
more time to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to gather all the facts and then do what's best for Kevin
Brown and the Dodgers," Tracy said. "The most important thing is to
get him healthy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Terry Mulholland, on the disabled list since May 4
because of back spasms, came to Coors Field expecting to throw a
simulated game, but the left-hander wound up being activated when the
Dodgers put right-hander Bryan Corey on the disabled list because of
a sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Corey suffered the injury Monday night, when he caught a spike on
the bullpen mound in the eighth inning while warming up during the
Dodgers' 11-5 win over the Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   Corey couldn't pitch, so Tracy had to use Eric Gagne in a non-save
situation.</TE>

he demanded a trade, but the left-hander won't be going
anywhere--with Brown sidelined because of elbow and back injuries,
Daal will remain in the rotation for several weeks. Jennings, the
rookie right-hander, has won five straight decisions and is 1-1
against the Dodgers this season.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Start Restoration With Loney</HD>
<DH>Draft: Team begins rebuilding farm with first baseman, one
of eight prep players taken with L.A.'s first 10 picks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Dodger management team that is trying to rebuild the depleted farm
system it inherited from the previous regime finally got its first
chance to make an impact Tuesday during the first day of baseball's
first-year draft.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers, who did not have a first-round pick last year,
selected James Loney, a high school first baseman from Texas with the
19th selection overall. Then, with compensation picks for the loss of
pitcher Chan Ho Park, they chose Anaheim Esperanza High left-hander
Greg Miller 31st and high school pitcher Zach Hammes with the 51st
pick.</LD>
<LD>   Loney, 6 feet 3 and 205 pounds, batted .509 with eight homers and
56 runs batted in for Elkins High in Missouri City, Texas, which was
ranked by Baseball America as the top prep team in the nation much of
the season. He was 9-1 with a 1.80 earned-run average and 106
strikeouts in 54 innings. He has signed a letter of intent with
Baylor.</LD>
<TE>   Dodger scouting director Logan White, who oversaw his first draft,
compared Loney to John Olerud.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a well-proportioned, strong, physical left-handed hitter and
also a tremendous fielder," White said. "About 80% of baseball had
him as a pitcher and 20% as a hitter. We think he is going to mature
into a great hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 6-5, 175 pounds, went 9-3 with four saves this season. He
struck out 137 and walked only 20. Hammes, 6-6, 220, has a fastball
clocked in the low 90s.</TE>
<TE>   "You always think about where you might go and this was the very
best I could have possibly have hoped for," Miller said. "I'd love to
get out and play as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers benefited from Park's decision to sign as a free agent
with the Texas Rangers, giving them two compensation picks and a
chance to restock their once-admired farm system. Eight of their
first 10 picks were high school players.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel any pressure because I didn't really think about
the past or what happened here before too much," White said. "I also
think we have a few more prospects in our system than people think."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels selected Virginia Tech left-hander Joe Saunders with
the 12th overall pick. Saunders, 6-4, 200, was 9-2 with a 2.86 ERA
and had 102 strikeouts in 972/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels chose pitcher Kevin Jepsen of Bishop Manogue High in
Sparks, Nev., with the 53rd pick and left-hander Kyle Pawelczyk of
Chipola Junior College in Florida with the 84th selection.</TE>
<TE>   Angel scouting director Donny Rowland said Saunders has good
velocity and command and could reach the big leagues faster than
Chris Bootcheck, the club's No. 1 pick in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Bullington, a pitcher from Ball State University, was
selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates with the No. 1 overall pick but
the next seven teams chose high school players.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Loewen, a high school left-hander from Surrey, British
Columbia, was chosen fourth by the Baltimore Orioles, and left-hander
Jeff Francis of the University of British Columbia was chosen ninth
by the Colorado Rockies, marking the first time two Canadians have
been chosen in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Two Southland high school shortstops were selected in the first
round. Scott Moore of Cypress High was picked eighth by the Detroit
Tigers and Sergio Santos of Santa Ana Mater Dei was selected 27th by
the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Every kid playing Little League dreams about getting drafted and
having a chance to play in the major leagues," said Moore, who has
signed a letter of intent with Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Santos, who has signed a letter of intent to USC, worked out for
the Dodgers, Angels and Diamondbacks before the draft. On Sunday, he
took batting practice at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I ever hit the ball as far as I did that day,"
Santos said. "I think it was just the adrenaline."</TE>
<TE>   Three first basemen who are sons of former major league players
were also selected in the first round. Prince Fielder, son of Cecil
Fielder, was picked seventh by the Milwaukee Brewers. John Mayberry
Jr. was selected No. 28 by the Seattle Mariners. And Nicholas
Swisher, son of Steve Swisher, was chosen 16th by the Oakland
Athletics, who had seven of the first 39 picks.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Kiel Fisher of Riverside Poly High was selected in
the third round by the Philadelphia Phillies. Oxnard left-hander Alex
Merricks went to the Minnesota Twins in the fourth round.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Jeremy Reed of Long Beach State, selected with the 59th
overall pick by the Chicago White Sox, was the highest drafted
Southland college player.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Bill Murphy of Cal State Northridge was selected in
the third round by Oakland. Pitcher Chris Smith of UC Riverside went
in the fourth round to Boston.</TE>
<TE>   USC first baseman Bill Peavey was chosen in the 11th round by
Cleveland. Trojan pitcher Anthony Reyes, projected before the season
as a high-round pick, was chosen in the 13th round by Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA outfielder Ben Francisco was drafted in the fifth round by
the Cleveland Indians, and the Bruin football team's presence in
professional baseball might continue to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Incoming freshmen defensive backs Michael Nixon and Jarrad Page
were selected Tuesday and could join Bruin safety Matt Ware and
cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. as dual-sport athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon, a 6-2, 210-pound catcher, from Phoenix Sunnyslope High, was
the Dodgers' third-round pick. He was the Arizona player of the year
in football as a quarterback, defensive back and kicker. Page, a 6-0,
200-pound switch-hitter from San Leandro High who can play short and
center, was taken in the fifth round by Milwaukee.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Keep It in the Family</HD>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers, hoping to add new meaning to the term "home-grown
talent," selected Claremont High pitcher Bryan Tracy, the 18-year-old
son of Manager Jim Tracy, in the 21st round of Tuesday's draft.</LD>
<LD>   "This was not a courtesy pick," Dodger scouting director Logan
White said. "He has a loose arm, a nice, easy delivery, and he's very
projectable. He could be a draft-and-follow guy, someone we could
sign [late] if he comes on in the summer."</LD>
<LD>   Bryan Tracy, a 6-foot-5, 170-pound right-hander, has a scholarship
offer to UC Santa Barbara, and Jim Tracy made it clear this week that
his son, an outstanding student who is considering a pre-med program,
will likely attend college. The Dodgers spent a middle-round pick on
him anyway.</LD>
<TE>   "If he chooses to go to Santa Barbara, I'm OK with that," White
said. "To me, [the 21st round] is not that high to take a kid who
will probably go to college. We knew other teams were interested in
him. We figured we'd keep it in the family."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Tracy was surprised his son, the 631st overall selection, was
drafted so high, and he didn't even know about the pick until
reporters informed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of him," Tracy said. "He's made a lot of progress
over the last few years, but he still has a long ways to go. He's a
nice project."</TE>

<HD>Three Winners, One Big Snub</HD>
<DH>French Open: Capriati and the Williams sisters prevail but
are unhappy about not playing on the main court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The losers, of course, weren't happy. The winners, at least three of
them, did not leave Roland Garros satisfied either, and the Women's
Tennis Assn. shared their perception about a lack of respect.</LD>
<LD>   The top three women's players, defending champion Jennifer
Capriati and Venus and Serena Williams, were unhappy Tuesday about
having to play their French Open quarterfinal matches on Court
Suzanne Lenglen, the secondary court, instead of on Philippe
Chatrier, the main court.</LD>
<LD>   It might sound like a tribute to them, as well as three-time
champion Monica Seles, to be placed on a court named for a legendary
tennis player, but tradition was not a convincing argument for
Capriati and the Williamses.</LD>
<TE>   As expected, they all advanced. The top-seeded Capriati had the
toughest time, defeating seventh-seeded Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia,
6-4, 4-6, 6-1. Dokic double-faulted 14 times and had 52 unforced
errors. Venus Williams, seeded second, beat No. 6 Seles, 6-4, 6-3,
avenging a quarterfinal loss at the Australian Open in January. Seles
looked flat and was not close to her form of January.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive winner was No. 3 Serena Williams, who
dismissed Mary Pierce of France, a former champion who was a
wild-card entrant this year, 6-1, 6-1, in 49 minutes, and said: "It
wasn't as easy as it looked out there."</TE>
<TE>   There was drama behind the scenes. WTA officials put forth a
strong case to the scheduling committee, which considered putting
Pierce's match on the main court. Serena Williams spoke about the
treatment of the women during a postmatch meal in the players'
lounge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair," she said. "Women's tennis is at its peak.
Everyone should be capitalizing on that. It's the principle of the
matter: Jennifer Capriati, the defending champion, is playing a tough
match on Suzanne Lenglen.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. It's weird. I think there has to be an explanation
given, I can't think of anything that can be good enough. If we take
affirmative action, it will have to change. It can't be just one
person pushing a boat. You have to have more."</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams, who reached her first French Open semifinal in six
trips, agreed with her younger sister. They couldn't see the women's
quarterfinals being played on a secondary court at any other Grand
Slam tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I can't really concentrate on that because of
everything that's at stake," Venus said. "It's disappointing to see
doubles matches on Center Court when there are so many good women's
matches to see. It's something I hope we can work toward changing."</TE>
<TE>   One of the men's doubles matches was a contest carried over from
Monday. It was shoehorned between Spaniard Albert Costa's 7-5, 3-6,
6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-0 victory over No. 15 Guillermo Canas of Argentina,
which ended Canas' series of marathon victories, and the match
between Alex Corretja of Spain and Andrei Pavel of Russia, which was
suspended in the third set because of darkness. Corretja won the
first two sets, 7-6 (5), 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Another doubles match was originally scheduled after the two men's
singles quarterfinals. Georgina Clark, vice president for the WTA's
European operations, was distressed by the decision and supported her
players.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely agree with them," she said. "It's a very tough
decision for the French Tennis Federation to have made. We're not
very happy with the decision. The doubles was an added insult."</TE>
<TE>   Clark was talking as she watched Dokic take the second set from
Capriati, which was the first set the defending champion had dropped
in five rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great shame for the rest of the public not to see a match
of this quality," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   The French sports daily L'Equipe questioned the tradition on
Tuesday, asking why those responsible at Roland Garros continue to
send the women to Suzanne Lenglen on quarterfinal day. This rule,
however, is not absolute. For example, Venus Williams played Martina
Hingis on Court Central in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Alain Riou, co-director of the tournament, acknowledged the
difficulties of the scheduling decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have weighed all the possibilities and finally decided without
any good solution, we had to lean on the sport side, which has led us
to make this program," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Wimbledon plays the women's quarterfinals on Tuesday, and the
men's quarterfinals on Wednesday. Riou said the French Open could
adopt that schedule someday, but not yet, suggesting the public might
not be able to support a day of women's quarterfinals, alone on the
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid the French public is not mature enough--maybe that's
not the right word--but maybe not prepared enough to buy 25,000
tickets for the men and women separately," he said. "It should be our
goal."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati had her own suggestion: Rename the main court Suzanne
Lenglen. She will play Serena Williams in the semifinals, and was
pleased with her quarterfinal preparation, winning the third set in
19 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what really starts to fuel my fire," Capriati said. "I
enjoy getting at this stage of a tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The Williams sisters have reached new territory at the French Open
and were joined by another first-time semifinalist at Roland Garros,
20-year-old Clarisa Fernandez of Argentina, who is making her debut

<HD>Hall Could Be Filled With Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Worthy, Sharman, Winter, Dantley among
those eligible to be inducted with Johnson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The one line missing from Magic Johnson's resume will be added today
when the former Laker great is introduced during a luncheon at the
Biltmore Hotel as one of the newest members of the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, whose brilliant playmaking put the show in Showtime and
carried the Lakers to five NBA championships in the 1980s, officially
is one of 24 finalists from which the hall's Class of 2002 will be
announced during the noon event.</LD>
<LD>   But his place in the hall, of course, has been assured for years,
ever since his career was cut short after he was diagnosed with HIV
in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Or, as one hall official put it Tuesday, "If he doesn't make it,
that's a major story."</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time that the Hall of Fame, located in
Springfield, Mass., has announced its class on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other finalists are six with Southland ties: James
Worthy, who played with Johnson on three Laker championship teams;
Bill Sharman, who coached the L.A. Lakers to their first NBA title in
1972; Tex Winter, a former Long Beach State coach, USC assistant and
a current assistant to Laker Coach Phil Jackson; Larry Brown, a
former UCLA and Clipper coach; Arizona Coach Lute Olson, a former
Long Beach State coach; and Adrian Dantley, who played for the Lakers
from 1977 to 1979.</TE>
<TE>   (Winter said Tuesday that he had not made the hall).</TE>
<TE>   Sharman, inducted as a player in 1976, would join John Wooden and
Lenny Wilkens as the only people enshrined as player and coach.</TE>
<TE>   Players must be retired for five years before they're eligible for
enshrinement. Coaches are eligible after coaching for at least 25
years.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the No. 1 pick in the 1979 NBA draft, arrived in Los
Angeles after helping Michigan State win the NCAA championship in an
epic battle against Larry Bird and Indiana State, a rivalry that
would continue throughout the '80s with the Lakers and Boston
Celtics. Bird was elected to the hall in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A 12-time NBA All-Star and three-time most valuable player,
Johnson helped the Lakers to the championship in his rookie season,
playing every position and scoring 42 points in the Game 6 clincher
against the Philadelphia 76ers when teammate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was
sidelined because of an injury.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers also won titles in 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "To go along with other great players, it's the greatest feeling
to know you are one of them, especially a kid from Lansing, Mich.,"
Johnson said of his impending enshrinement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's truly a dream come true....</TE>
<TE>   "Even when I'm dead and gone, my bust will still be there and
people will say, 'Who was that skinny guy?'"</TE>
<TE>   Enshrinement ceremonies for this year's class of inductees will be
held Sept. 27 in Springfield, one day before the hall's new
$103-million complex opens.</TE>

<LD>When trainer Joshua Litt has started a horse in 2002, it has paid to
pay attention.</LD>
<LD>   Litt has had only 16 starters this year, but six have made their
way to the winner's circle.</LD>
<LD>   Game Well Planned, a 3-year-old, Washington-bred gelding, has
contributed two of those victories and he'll try for a third in
today's fifth at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   Claimed for $16,000 at Golden Gate Fields on March 6 by Litt for
the J B K Stable, Game Well Planned stepped up three levels to win by
two lengths at 16-1 on April 5 at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Bumped up again by Litt on May 15, Game Well Planned made a
successful turf debut, winning by a little more than a length at
14-1.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking another victory against a similar field going 11/16 miles
on the grass, the sophomore will be a much shorter price today in the
first leg of the pick four. Iggy Puglisi, who rode him to his latest
win, has the call again today.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Arlington Park will begin its lengthy 107-day
meet, a season that will conclude when the track plays host to the
Breeders' Cup for the first time Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Hollendorfer, who led the standings at the Illinois track
last year, is back with a string this year. Also returning is Rene
Douglas, the top jockey a year ago with 134 winners.</TE>
<TE>   The final three races on the Arlington card will be simulcast at
Hollywood Park today. The seventh is a seven-furlong allowance for
3-year-olds, the eighth is a six-furlong allowance for 3-year-olds
and up and the ninth is a mile turf race for 3- and 4-year-old maiden
fillies.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Hot Market will try to go wire-to-wire against
the comebacking Kela, San Bernardino Handicap runner-up Mysterious
Cat, the late-running Prized Gem and Jimmy Z in Hollywood Park's
second, a $55,000 allowance at 11/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Sadler. He has won with 10 of 39 starters, leaving
him one up on Vladimir Cerin in the Hollywood Park trainer standings.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The trainers in today's third race. The seven have
combined to begin the Hollywood Park season three for 59.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Chalifoux, Baby Go Baby
and X Slews Me in the first, singling Hot Market in the second and
using Primacy, Our Sharon Stone, Alessandria and Suspicious Girl in
the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/82. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $3.60/$463.20. Total money bet: $518.</TE>

<HD>Japan, Belgium Generate Excitement</HD>
<DH>Group H: Teams in maligned quartet play to 2-2 tie.
Controversy reigns after Japan goal in extra time is disallowed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FUKUI, Japan</DL>
<LD>World Cup co-host Japan and Belgium opened play in the tournament's
much-maligned Group H, which doesn't have much going for it aside
from the possibility that somebody's bound to win it. Unless they all
tie.</LD>
<LD>   In front of a mostly blue-clad, mostly crazed crowd of 55,256 in
Saitama, Japan, which has never won a World Cup match, and Belgium,
which tied all of its World Cup matches in 1998, did the predictable
Tuesday, playing to a 2-2 draw.</LD>
<LD>   But at least they did it in unpredictable style. After 55
scoreless minutes, Japan and Belgium finished with a flurry--Belgium
taking the lead on a sensational bicycle kick by captain Marc
Wilmots, Japan countering with two quick goals of its own, followed
by a 75th-minute equalizer by Belgium and a potential game-winner by
Japan controversially waved off in extra time.</LD>
<TE>   Junichi Inamoto, who had scored Japan's second goal in the 67th
minute, appeared to beat the Belgium defense for a late winner, only
to have the goal disallowed by referee William Mattus, who claimed
Inamoto had fouled to win the ball before chipping it in.</TE>
<TE>   Replays were inconclusive, prompting Japan Coach Philippe
Troussier to rail afterward, "The referee might have thought that
Belgium were the home team. I wonder if the decisions [he made] were
fair."</TE>
<TE>   Belgium has a reputation for bland soccer, but its first goal of
the 2002 World Cup was worthy of Brazil. Eric Van Meir lofted the
ball into the penalty area for Wilmots, who leaped to meet the ball
and fired an overhead kick past Japan goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki just
inside the near post.</TE>
<TE>   Belgians don't often witness this sort of thing, unless it's being
done against Belgium. A stunned Belgium Coach Robert Waseige ran out
of adjectives for the play, describing Wilmots, simply, as "our
priceless captain."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, two minutes after that goal, Belgium's lead was gone. And
eight minutes after that, Japan had the lead, courtesy of two
rapid-fire strikes by Takayuki Suziki, who latched onto a long pass
and toe-poked the ball past keeper Geert De Vlieger, and Inamoto, who
outran three defenders and beat De Vlieger inside the far post.</TE>
<TE>   Belgium salvaged the tie in the 75th minute, when defender Peter
Van Der Heyden pushed up on a counterattack and chipped over Narazaki
from 12 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Waseige said he was "satisfied" with the result, noting that
"after losing control of the game to Japan, at least we came back. We
were basically playing an away game.... The crowd was more than a
12th man for the Japanese team. They were exceptional."</TE>
<TE>   Troussier was less pleased, but acknowledged the tie gave his team
"a historic point, because it's the first point Japan has got in the
World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   In its first trip to the World Cup in 1998, Japan scored one goal
in three games and finished 0-3.</TE>

<LD>Inductees into the National Basketball Hall of Fame were told they
would be notified by Monday, and Tex Winter's telephone never rang.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't make it again," Winter said, somewhat sadly, Tuesday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The fall class, headed by Magic Johnson, will be announced today
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Winter, who turned 80 in February and has been nominated several
times, has coached for 55 years. He's reconsidering retirement, but
will hold his decision until the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting to the point where it's disappointing," Winter said.
"I would think I'd be seriously considered. I don't know, maybe I
am."</TE>
<TE>   Laker consultant Bill Sharman, already in the Hall as a player and
nominated this year as a coach, had not been notified as of Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Byron Scott and Kobe Bryant were teammates during the 1996-97
season, Scott's last with the Lakers and Bryant's first. They became
friends.</TE>
<TE>   "He meant a lot to me," Bryant said. "The advice he gave me my
rookie year I still hold dear today."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Scott recommended a particular food when the series goes
to New Jersey, Bryant said, "Hopefully, their bacon cheeseburgers are
a lot better than in Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's jerseys, since the start of the playoffs: Derek Jeter,
Mariano Rivera, Hank Aaron and, on Sunday, Joe Montana.</TE>
<TE>   "I have about a thousand jerseys at the house. I just pull one out
every once in a while," he said, laughing. "No, just playing."</TE>
<TE>   He's more selective than that.</TE>
<TE>   "I just like Joe Montana," said Bryant, who so far has worn the
uniforms of players known for being unusually competitive or clutch.
"He's a great player. He's a type of player who, even though they
were down two or three touchdowns, he'd still lead the team to a
win."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a workout day, Bryant wore Jerry West's No. 44, just
as he did in the last parade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Shaquille O'Neal was looking for a sign entering his third
consecutive NBA Finals, his youngest daughter, Amirah, provided it,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "My little daughter, she just said, 'Three,'" he said. "She just
said 'Three' the other day. That's a true story."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In last year's finals, Todd MacCulloch watched from the bench as
O'Neal pulverized Dikembe Mutombo, who was the league defensive
player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal became the Finals MVP and Mutombo left with a swollen nose.</TE>
<TE>   "I may have to talk to Lucious [Harris] about melting his mask to
fit me," MacCulloch said.</TE>
<TE>   Harris wears a plastic mask, first because of a broken bone
between his ear and cheek, and now because he has played well with it
on, as have the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak is attending a pre-draft camp
in Chicago. The Lakers have the 27th pick. He will miss Game 1 and is
expected to return Thursday.... Samaki Walker's bruised left knee
appears to be causing him more discomfort than usual.</TE>

<HD>And Last but Not ... Least?</HD>
<DH>Lakers: After grueling trip through the West, they are
trying to show proper respect for East champion Nets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of the NBA Finals, Shaquille O'Neal called Todd MacCulloch
"respectable."</LD>
<LD>   MacCulloch, who has reddish hair and freckles, flushed. He stepped
back from the lectern in the corner of the gym and composed himself.</LD>
<LD>   This is the starting center for the New Jersey Nets, champions of
the Eastern Conference. Just last year, he played for the
Philadelphia 76ers, who met the Lakers in the finals--and won a game.</LD>
<TE>   He is 7 feet tall and 280 pounds. He, along with Jason Kidd, has
had a nice influence on the formerly sorry Nets, who needed some heft
in the middle and a sense of humor, both of which MacCulloch
provided. He scored almost 10 points a game in the regular season and
started every game in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "He said I'm respectable?" MacCulloch asked.</TE>
<TE>   He smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a huge compliment right there, coming from him,"
MacCulloch said, clearly touched at a portrayal of his skills that
was somewhat short of derogatory. "That's a real nice thing to say."</TE>
<TE>   And everyone laughed with him, because MacCulloch is an easy-going
sort.</TE>
<TE>   Few outside East Rutherford and, maybe, Secaucus, expect the Nets
to prevail. The Lakers, by many accounts, went most of the way toward
their third consecutive NBA title on Sunday, when they beat the
Sacramento Kings in overtime of Game 7. The Nets trudged in through
the sagging bracket of a down conference, a gutsy team with little
apparent chance of repeating those thrills in the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, the series fits neatly into the O'Neal-MacCulloch
scheme, a matchup of the established vs. the newcomers, of the
ferocious vs. those who get by, Top 50 vs. respectable, and happy
with it.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have never won an NBA title, have never even played for
one. The Lakers are going on 14, eight in the last 22 years. While
the feats of Magic Johnson and, among others, Byron Scott, could have
no concrete impact on tonight's opener, there is something to be said
for having been there before.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that we're here with the opportunity to do that, I think you
can think about what four more wins would mean," Laker forward Rick
Fox said. "Not only just the championship, but solidifying the
success of this team the last three years. It's an opportunity to
stand with a lot of teams that have been able to do it a third time.
There have been a lot of back-to-backs, but to do it a third time is
rather remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, on the other hand, are being asked what they're doing
here.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here," Net forward Kenyon Martin said Tuesday. "You have to
play the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been playing well in the playoffs. If not, we would not be
here.... If we are able to win this, I guess people would probably
say it was a fluke. So, I'm tired of trying to plead my case to
people."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are capable enough, it would seem, but lacking the talent
to deal with O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and a system--Phil
Jackson's--seemingly built for June.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won 11 consecutive playoff series, and now come
upon the Nets, the only thing between them and another decorative
banner for Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets must defend O'Neal, who tore through the Kings,
particularly in the last two games of the series. The Lakers will run
several players at Kidd, who has carried the revival of the Nets with
his floor skills.</TE>
<TE>   "Get back and stop the ball," Jackson said of the tactics against
Kidd. "It doesn't matter who guards him. We've got to get back and
stop the ball. That's the first rule against Jason Kidd. After that,
know that he facilitates their offense. He's not interested in
scoring, he's interested in winning."</TE>
<TE>   There is a curiosity about the Lakers' legs, which fatigued in a
seven-game conference finals. Last year, however, the Lakers had a
week and a half to rest between the conference and NBA Finals, and
then lost their only game of that postseason in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   MacCulloch recalls that. The Lakers beat his 76ers in five games,
for their second consecutive championship. Now he has O'Neal again,
this time without Dikembe Mutombo, this time with Aaron Williams and
Jason Collins and a prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming a hale O'Neal, there would not be a more definitive
mismatch on the court. "Does it motivate me? Yeah, it motivates me,"
MacCulloch said, adding, "I don't know who Shaq plays where it's not
a mismatch. Tell me another guy. I'm just another one of those guys
on the other end trying to do my job."</TE>

<LD>The Lakers' run to the NBA Finals this season was a Rocky Horry Show
compared to last year, when virtually the only suspense in the</LD>
<LD>   Western Sweepstakes was when Mad Dog Madsen would get into the
game. A comparison of the two Laker teams in reaching the NBA Finals:</LD>
<LD>   Note: Statistics are per game.</LD>
<TE>*--*
                       2001   2002  The Difference
Record                 11-0   11-4  A very un-Zen-like Phil Jackson
                                    annoyed with actually having to
                                    get out of his seat to call
                                    timeouts
Points                 104.6  95.7  Laker offense downgraded from a
                                    cruise ship to a cargo boat ...
                                    anchored in the Bermuda Triangle
Opponent Points        89.2   93.3  Been a long time since the Lakers
                                    have been pick-and-rolled like
                                    they were by the Kings
Points Differential    +15.4  +2.4  13--almost unlucky for the 2002
                                    Lakers, who did it with mirrors
                                    in the Western Conference finals
Field-Goal %           468    430   Ruben Patterson stripped of Kobe

Opponent Field-Goal %  401    423   Lakers were plumb worn out by the
                                    Drain Man, Mike Bibby
3-Point%               343     310  No Three-Peat for Derek Fisher,
                                    whose shooting from behind the
                                    arc was far off last year's mark
Opponent 3-Point %     266    311   Kings' Game 7 clanking from
                                    three-point range was louder than
                                    all the cow bells at Arco Arena
Free-Throw %           676    718   Who is the man whose free throws
                                    gave the Lakers the upper hand?
                                    Shaq. Right on
Rebounds               49.5   45.8  Lakers had a spring in their step
                                    last year. This year, they're
                                    wearing Ground Samakis
Opponent Rebounds      39.9   43.1  Kenyon Martin is checking the

                                    his contract
Rebound Differential   +9.6   +2.7  Lakers should consider having a
                                    block-out party in the NBA Finals
Assists                22.7   18.7  Another category in which the
                                    2002 Lakers couldn't pass for the
                                    2001 Lakers
Turnovers              13.5   13.3  No turnover at completion of
                                    these NBA Finals:
                                    Keep-the-Ball-Rolling Lakers will

<HD>Could It Be Magic?</HD>
<DH>From humble beginnings in Lansing, Mich., Earvin Johnson
went on to an NCAA championship and led the Lakers to five NBA
titles. Today he will take his place in the Hall of Fame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LANSING, Mich</DL>
<LD>Before Magic, there was June Bug. Before the Lakers or the Michigan
State Spartans, there were the Main Street School and the Everett
High Vikings. Before Pat Riley or Jud Heathcote, there were Jim Dart
and George Fox.</LD>
<LD>   And before Hollywood or Inglewood, there was Lansing.</LD>
<LD>   Earvin "Magic" Johnson is expected to be elected to the basketball
Hall of Fame today for his memorable career with the Lakers. In the
world of professional sports, too often tarnished by cynicism and
greed, Johnson's big smile and overflowing enthusiasm were refreshing
changes. In the world of professional basketball, his ability to play
like a point guard in the body of a 6-foot-9 forward was a
revelation.</LD>
<TE>   But not in Lansing. The people of Johnson's hometown had seen his
act for years. They had watched little June Bug Johnson dribble a
ball down to the store with his right hand and dribble it back with
his left. They had listened over and over to his dreams of dribbling
from small town America all the way to the hallowed courts of the
NBA.</TE>
<TE>   They are not surprised that this journey is ending at the Hall of
Fame in Springfield, Mass. They know how it all began.</TE>
<TE>   A Tot and His Dot</TE>
<TE>   Johnson grew up in the heartland of America, on Main Street, USA.
Literally. There was plenty of family around, plenty of friends,
plenty of love. Earvin Johnson Sr. and wife Christine have been
married for 44 years. They brought up nine kids--Magic is the
fourth-youngest--and have 23 grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   They certainly weren't able to provide their family the kind of
luxury Magic has enjoyed through his adult life but nobody left the
Johnson table hungry, or went out into the Michigan winter improperly
clothed.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't easy. The family was crammed into a two-story,
three-bedroom house on Main Street in a tree-lined, middle-class
neighborhood, boys in one room, girls in another.</TE>
<TE>   Lansing, the state capital, is a company town. The two major
employers of this community of 447,000 are the state government and
Michigan State University, but close behind is General Motors. Earvin
worked on the assembly line for the automotive giant. But, needing a
second job to support his brood, he also worked at a service station
and later had a trash-collection business. He would come home
exhausted in the middle of the night, slip into the bathtub to ease
his aching bones and sometimes fall asleep there, never making it to
bed. Christine worked for the school system as a lunch-room
supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing how hard his parents labored, Earvin Jr.--the Junior
evolved into June Bug--would tell his father, "Dad, someday I'm going
to take care of you and Momma."</TE>
<TE>   From his mother came the communication skills. It is eerie how
much Magic resembles Christine, from the warm smile to the expressive
hand gestures to the receptive eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Earvin is quieter, but he obviously passed on his resolve to
succeed and positive attitude to his son.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, he passed on his love of basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of Earvin Sr.'s work schedule, there was always time
for basketball. He and his sons would watch the NBA game of the week
every Sunday, the father pointing out the subtleties of the game,
subtleties he had learned as a high school basketball player in his
native Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   "We girls sometimes wanted to watch something else," said Magic's
sister, Pearl. "But there was only one TV and the men ruled."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the televised games, there were basketball wars on the
playground down the street between Earvin and June Bug.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a basket in our driveway because we were too poor
to afford one," Earvin said.</TE>
<TE>   He showed his son no mercy on the court. There was liberal fouling
either way. If June Bug wanted to beat his father, which he
desperately did, he was just going to have to get better.</TE>
<TE>   He worked at it. Christine would awaken at 6:30 a.m. to get the
kids ready for school, only to find June Bug's bed empty. He was
already down at the Main Street School, shooting hoops before class.</TE>
<TE>   At home, he made a dot on the wall with a pencil, used a folded
pair of his father's socks as a makeshift ball, and fired away for
hours at that dot, his make-believe basket, all the while doing
running commentary in which, of course, June Bug Johnson was the star
of the game.</TE>
<TE>   When he tired of that, he would open the laundry basket at the top
of the stairs, grab some socks and shoot baskets, moving down a step
at a time to increase the difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   "That was his life," Pearl said.</TE>
<TE>   So didn't this kid ever get into trouble? Well, there was the time
in his preteens when June Bug came home with candy in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he had no money," Earvin said. "I made him take it back to
the store."</TE>
<TE>   And then he made June Bug pull a switch off a nearby tree for his
subsequent spanking.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, there were good times.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be sitting up in the house on Main Street, and you could
hear that big, jolly laugh of his as he came down the block," said
Pearl of her brother. "It's the same laugh he has today.</TE>
<TE>   "And I remember, he always had his ball with him. I can't think of
a time when he was ever really down. Except when he lost a game."</TE>
<TE>   More Than The TV Was Black And White</TE>
<TE>   Blue-eyed, blond-haired Greta Dart, Johnson's fifth-grade teacher
at Main Street School, introduced him to the white world.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson grew up in the 1960s and '70s, a time of extreme racial
unrest in this country. And Lansing had its share of it.</TE>
<TE>   The sting of prejudice cracked Johnson's smile occasionally. He
felt it when the family would go to Mississippi in the summer to
visit his father's relatives. He felt it later when mandatory busing
put him in a predominantly white high school.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson came home, while still a youngster, and asked his mother,
"Why are there white people who don't like black people?"</TE>
<TE>   She told him, "Just because some people don't love you doesn't
mean you have to hate them."</TE>
<TE>   Through Greta and her husband, Jim, Johnson found his path to
integration. He became the teacher's pet, staying after school to
close the windows or tidy the room. On the way home from the
playground, he would stop at the Darts for milk and cookies. Or to
get his pants altered by Greta, who sewed.</TE>
<TE>   Or he would go over simply to get measured. Greta would stand
Johnson up against the wall and make a mark at the top of his head.
As the years went by, those marks went way up that wall. Johnson was
over 5 feet tall in the fifth grade. As chronicled on the Darts'
wall, he was up to 6 feet by the seventh grade, 6-3 in the eighth
grade, 6-5 in the ninth and 6-6 by the time he started high school,
on his way to 6-9.</TE>
<TE>   When Johnson needed an adult to supervise an after-school
basketball program in elementary school, he enlisted Jim. Jim
delivered beverages in Lansing, and he often took Johnson on his
route.</TE>
<TE>   "It took forever, because he talked to everyone in every store,"
Jim said.</TE>
<TE>   Before he got his driver's license, Johnson would ask the Darts to
drop him and his friends off at parties.</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson put restrictions on the Darts.</TE>
<TE>   "We would get within a block of the party and he would say, 'This
is far enough,'" Greta recalled. "We would tell him we could take him
right to the door, but he'd say no. I think he was embarrassed to
have his friends see him dropped off by a white, middle-aged couple."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever Johnson got a new girlfriend, which was a frequent
occurrence, he sent her by the Darts for approval.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept telling him, our favorite was always Cookie [his eventual
wife]," Greta said.</TE>
<TE>   'How About Magic?'</TE>
<TE>   Johnson assumed that, after junior high, he'd go to Sexton High.
It was his neighborhood school, it was where his friends went and it
was where he desperately wanted to go.</TE>
<TE>   But in the 1970s, mandatory busing required Johnson to attend
mostly white Everett, across town.</TE>
<TE>   "Momma, can I go to Sexton?" he asked Christine.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go where you're supposed to go," she told him.</TE>
<TE>   He was bitter at first. And uncomfortable. He made the basketball
team as a sophomore but found himself shut out by his teammates, who
were reluctant to pass the ball to this high-profile newcomer. They
regarded him as a hot dog who needed to cool his heels.</TE>
<TE>   But they soon realized there was substantial skill beneath the
show, that Johnson could take Everett to previously unimagined
heights.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Stabley Jr., a 24-year-old sportswriter for the Lansing State
Journal, had heard about the Vikings' new young phenom. He covered
Johnson's first game at Everett. The Vikings beat Holt High in
overtime. Johnson had 12 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   When Stabley returned to the office, he was asked, "What's this
Earvin Johnson like?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing special," Stabley replied. "He's a great junior high
school player, a gangly 6-6 kid. Oh, he'll be a good high school
player one day."</TE>
<TE>   That day arrived sooner than Stabley could have imagined. When
Everett beat Jackson Parkside in the next game, 86-50, Johnson had 36
points, 20 rebounds, 15 assists and 10 steals.</TE>
<TE>   "People sat there with their mouths open," Stabley said. "They
couldn't believe it. It stunned me too. I had never seen anything
like this kid at this age."</TE>
<TE>   As he walked to the locker room after the game, Stabley decided
that Earvin Johnson Jr. needed a flashy nickname to go along with his
flashy game.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got to his locker, he had his little entourage of junior
varsity kids around him, so I waited," Stabley said.</TE>
<TE>   And while Stabley waited, he thought. How about the Big E? No,
that was Elvin Hayes. Dr. J was obviously out. Julius Erving had the
copyright on that one.</TE>
<TE>   Then, it came to him. This kid is a magician on the court.
Magician ... Magic!</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to call you something," he told Johnson. "How about
Magic?"</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen-year-old Earvin Johnson Jr. nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's OK with me, Mr. Stabley," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a month before the name got into print," Stabley said. "I
didn't have the guts to call a 15-year-old kid 'Magic.'"</TE>
<TE>   Tim Staudt, a sportscaster at a Lansing television station, wasn't
impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "That name is too hokey," Staudt told Stabley. "It will never
last."</TE>
<TE>   Impressing Coach(es)</TE>
<TE>   George Fox could see the magic from the beginning. The coach at
Everett, he had heard from his players about this junior high kid
"with charisma."</TE>
<TE>   Like any coach, Fox was more interested in the kid's work ethic
than his showmanship. What he found in Johnson was a pleasant
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Earvin was the hardest-working player I ever had," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the first practice, Fox had his players jog around
the gym for as long as their stamina would permit. Johnson decided
he'd be the last one to quit. But so did one of his teammates, Randy
Shumway. One by one, the others dropped out, their tongues lolling,
their legs aching. But Johnson and Shumway kept running.</TE>
<TE>   After 30 minutes, the others players having long since stretched
out on the floor, Johnson and Shumway were still going, their jog
reduced to a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, they stopped at the same time, put their arms around each
other and went to Fox with grins on their faces.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach," Johnson said, "we quit together."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's resolve and dedication showed on the court, but he
always made sure there was some Showtime. If Johnson was the trailer
on a fast break, he would often yell, "Yo!" to the ballhandler ahead
of him. That was the signal for his teammate to lay the ball high up
on the glass so that Johnson could swoop in behind and slam it
through the hoop.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said the greatest game he ever saw Johnson play was in a
summer tournament in Saginaw, Mich. With Gene Bartow, then UCLA's
coach, in the crowd, Johnson was at his wheeling, dealing best. Fox
swears that on one trip down the court, Johnson went behind his back
with the ball, and then came back again in the other direction
without missing a step.</TE>
<TE>   While Johnson was still a sophomore, Fox asked him what his
ultimate goal was.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be All-City," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to set higher goals than that," Fox told him.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently that happened, for Everett reached the quarterfinals of
the state tournament that season. In Johnson's junior year, the
Vikings got to the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   In his senior year, Johnson was averaging more than 40 points a
game, but Fox wasn't happy.</TE>
<TE>   "You are putting on such a show, Earvin, that the others players
are just standing around, watching you," Fox told him. "If you want
to win a state championship, you have to lower your average to only
25 to 30 points and get everybody else involved."</TE>
<TE>   Replied Johnson, "I'll do it, Coach."</TE>
<TE>   He did and Everett did, indeed, win the state championship.</TE>
<TE>   All of this, of course, did not go unnoticed by college
recruiters. More than 100 schools courted Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Fox remembers the day Indiana's Bob Knight came to Everett.</TE>
<TE>   "Earvin was 6-71/2 or 6-8 by that point," Fox said. "But with his
big Afro, he looked about 6-10."</TE>
<TE>   When Johnson walked in to meet Knight, the coach said, "Hey, big
fella, where in the hell are you going to go to school?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know, Coach," Johnson replied.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you one thing," Knight said. "If you come to Indiana,
we are not going to give you anything. You are going to have to earn
it."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Johnson didn't go anywhere. He stayed in the
neighborhood and went five miles up the road to Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   "I always knew he wouldn't want to abandon this town," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Still Handing Out Assists</TE>
<TE>   Although he lives in L.A., has business interests stretching from
coast to coast and basketball obligations around the globe, Johnson
still finds time for Lansing.</TE>
<TE>   On Labor Day weekend in 1987, the Darts heard a knock at the door
of their Lansing townhouse. It was Johnson, a grin on his face and
one of his most-valuable-player awards in his hand. He wanted them to
have it.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson invited the Darts out to the 1988 Rose Bowl game, in which
Michigan State, the alma mater they all shared, beat USC. After the
game, Johnson pulled Greta aside and handed her another present, a
pendant containing four diamonds, one for each of the NBA
championships he had won to that point.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, while making an appearance at a Lansing golf tournament,
Johnson gave the Darts a check for $50,000, part of which went toward
a cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Greta still teaches elementary school in Lansing and Jim is a beer
and wine wholesaler. The Darts never had children, but, outside of
the Johnson family, nobody in town has a closer tie to Lansing's
favorite son.</TE>
<TE>   "They were like my second parents," Johnson said. "They gave me my
first jobs.... They made sure I had everything I needed. They sent me
to basketball camps, took me to every game they could and really
helped me to stay out of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   And Fox? When Johnson opened a Starbucks franchise in Lansing, he
asked Fox, now 67 and retired, to introduce him at the grand opening.</TE>
<TE>   Stabley, now the sports information director at Central Michigan
University in Mount Pleasant and gone from Lansing for 20 years, will
never get away from his magical link to Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get around some new group," Stabley said, "and someone will
say, 'You know what Fred's claim to fame is, don't you?'"</TE>
<TE>   When he dies, Stabley knows, his obituary will begin, "Fred
Stabley, who gave Earvin Johnson the name Magic ... "</TE>
<TE>   Said Stabley, "The years I watched that kid play were an absolute
thrill. If that's how my obit begins, that would be just fine."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's primary connection to Lansing, of course, is his family.
His parents and half his siblings still live there.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was my hero," Johnson said. "And I got my personality from
my mother."</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, he bought several acres in a rich, green wooded
area of town on Delta River Road and told his parents to build their
dream home there.</TE>
<TE>   "How much do you want us to spend?" they asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you want," Johnson told them.</TE>
<TE>   They opted for a two-story, seven-bedroom house, complete with a
circular driveway, which serves as the gathering place for the entire
Johnson clan on holidays and other special occasions.</TE>
<TE>   The joy of that home was shattered on a November day in 1991 when
Johnson called to tell his parents he was HIV positive and would be
retiring from the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't the end of the world," Earvin told his son. "You can
deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   Christine was in church at the time. When she arrived home and was
told of her son's horrifying revelation, she remembered, "That was
the worst moment of my life. Oh my Lord, it hit me like a ton of
bricks."</TE>
<TE>   She got into the car and drove around, aimlessly.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know where I was going," she said. "I didn't know what
to do."</TE>
<TE>   When she composed herself, Christine called her son and told him
she wanted to fly to L.A. for the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "No, Momma, don't come," he said. "This is something I have to do
by myself. Just pray for me and I'll be home after the announcement."</TE>
<TE>   It was her faith, Christine said, that got her through the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in God's hands," she said. "All of us are going to die of
something. He won't die until his time."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the devastating news, Christine said, she had to deal
with unkind remarks by some of her fellow Lansing residents.</TE>
<TE>   "People can be so cruel," she said. "I didn't know how cruel until
[then]."</TE>
<TE>   But 10 years removed from that ultimate low, the Johnsons are
about to experience the ultimate high, their son going into the Hall
of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad the Lord kept me around long enough to see it,"
Earvin said.</TE>
<TE>   Christine said, "I've come up from being a little child working in
the cotton fields of North Carolina, come up from having nothing,"
she said. "When you look at how blessed we have been, it's amazing.
It blows your mind."</TE>

<KH>Xs and O's RICK MAJERUS</KH>
<HD>Net Fan Says Lakers Will Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK MAJERUS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I need to start with a disclaimer.</LD>
<LD>   I never had a son, but if I had, I would want him to be as nice a
person as Keith Van Horn, who played for me at Utah. And if my son
also were one-hundredth the basketball player, I'd be the happiest
guy on earth.</LD>
<LD>   Understand that, while I may be the only writer from the L.A.
Times--or any other paper, I presume--with a Nets' cap on, the
readers will get objectivity, even those sending me all those
e-mails. (Please save the threats of bodily harm for the more
deserving T.J. Simers.).</LD>
<TE>   So, with apologies to Van Horn, I think it is clear the Lakers
will win the series. Here's why:</TE>
<TE>   There is no antidote for the Big Aristotle, unless somebody is
asking him to take a philosophy test. Shaquille O'Neal will patrol
the lane on both sides of the court and New Jersey will be
hard-pressed to handle him with single coverage. Once Todd MacCulloch
goes down for the count, the Nets have to go to Aaron Williams, who
is too small. When they double-team, it will be just a matter of
picking their poison.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a school of thought that says Jason Kidd will lead a
fastbreak attack that could do in the Lakers. But let's face it. New
Jersey is the junior varsity of the pro fastbreak. The Lakers just
beat the varsity. No NBA team takes the ball out of the net and gets
it back on attack better or faster than Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there'll be some tight moments. Phil Jackson might have to
get up and ruffle some feathers, even take some timeouts as he did in
Game 7 against the Kings. And the Laker players may have to forego
all those timeout-huddle glances at the Laker girls for a while.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, at the end of the day, you can count on L.A.'s
transition defense to hold off the Jersey boys from the Bada-Bing
Club.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey runs the Princeton offense. That's a combination of
ball and player movement that includes shuffle movement and back-door
cuts, as well as flare screens by the center out of the high post and
counter-flow action off picks against the grain. (If that is too
technical, send an e-mail to t.j.simers@latimes.com for an
explanation and a giggle.)</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have the answer to the Princeton offense with Shaq and
the other Laker big men bodying over and through the high picks set
by MacCulloch. Also, Shaq is as savvy a veteran as there is at
spotting repetition in an opposing offense and quickly tearing it
apart. New Jersey better vary its act, or Shaq will knock it all the
way off Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets won't play as fast as Sacramento. New Jersey will take
the break when it is there, and it is there a lot because the Nets
are led by the best rebounding point guard in the game in Kidd. But
overall, this will be more Laker tempo than the Kings' series.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets' Kerry Kittles is likely to be embarking on a nightmare.
Sacramento's Doug Christie bellied up to Kobe Bryant and did a great
job of not being fooled by the footwork and change-of-pace dribbles.
Still, Bryant scored in every critical, clutch situation that would
be expected from the best or second-best player in the game today.
Our prayers are with you, Kerry.</TE>
<TE>   A side thought here. New Jersey didn't get a lot of attention for
its box-and-one and its zoning in the Celtic series, but that sort of
switching around of defenses was quite disruptive to Boston and might
be, somewhat, to the Lakers. Look for the Nets to try those things.
After all, what do they have to lose, except the series, which seems
inevitable, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Also, look for New Jersey to play with heart and determination.
I've been impressed with their patience, defensive pressure and
attitude. However, the main stars in this performance, Shaq and Kobe,
are wearing purple and will reign. Expect a prince of a show.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Majerus, Utah basketball coach, will be The Times' guest
analyst on the Lakers for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the
fourth-winningest active coach in major college basketball, will
begin his 14th season at Utah this fall.</TE>

<LD>STARTERS</LD>
<LD>   This amounts to one MVP candidate, Jason Kidd, against two,
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. Kidd has averaged a near
triple-double in the playoffs--19.3 points, 8.9 assists and 8.4
rebounds. His outside shot might have deserted him, but he is perhaps
the most versatile and brightest court presence in the league. Kerry
Kittles starts with Kidd in the backcourt, and Kenyon Martin, Todd
MacCulloch and Keith Van Horn start up front. Martin, a gritty
defender, has temper issues. He was suspended five times in the
regular season but has kept his composure in the playoffs.
MacCulloch, signed as a key free agent last summer, has a mid-range
jump shot and six fouls to spend on O'Neal. Van Horn has a reputation
as a soft player but has made some shots in the playoffs. In the
conference finals against the Boston Celtics, for instance, he made
nearly 40% of his three-pointers. O'Neal and Bryant get occasional
help from Robert Horry, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher.</LD>
<LD>   Edge: Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   BENCH</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have a bench? You wouldn't have known it by the
conference finals, in particular Game 7, when Phil Jackson played his
starters for 236 of a possible 265 minutes. At least one of those 29
leftover minutes was for Bryant to change into new shorts. Lindsey
Hunter's on-ball, end-to-end defense got him on the floor against San
Antonio's Tony Parker and Sacramento's Mike Bibby, and will again
against Kidd. Devean George has had his moments as an offensive
rebounder but has made only 30% of his shots and has been prone to
fouling. Power forward Samaki Walker, a starter in the regular season
and into the conference semifinals, has seen his playing time dwindle
as the playoffs move on. He has a bone bruise on his left knee, which
has limited his mobility. Brian Shaw has his usual calming influence
on the offense. Byron Scott depends on Lucious Harris, a versatile
6-foot-5 player who has averaged 9.1 points in the playoffs, burly
Aaron Williams and athletic Richard Jefferson in the frontcourt, and
Jason Collins at center. MacCulloch starts but is averaging only 19.4
minutes in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Nets.</TE>
<TE>   OFFENSE</TE>
<TE>   The Nets run the Princeton offense, similar to what the Sacramento
Kings employed, only better, in some regards. The Kings frequently
broke away from their ball movement and back cuts to attack the
Lakers with high screen-and-rolls by Mike Bibby and Chris Webber.
Kidd is a better passer than Bibby but doesn't shoot as well. So, he
concentrates harder on getting his teammates the ball. In the regular
season, when they shocked the league on their way to 52 wins and the
Atlantic Division title, the Nets had four players--Martin, Van Horn,
Kidd and Kittles--who averaged 13-15 points. Of them, Kidd perhaps is
the least dependable shooter. The Lakers run on O'Neal and Bryant,
who in 15 playoff games have combined to average 53 points, about
what they averaged in the regular season. They finally got some
consistent help in Game 7 of the conference finals, when every
starter scored at least 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   The Nets held their three playoff opponents to 41.9% shooting. In
the Eastern Conference finals, they found ways to keep Paul Pierce
and Antoine Walker well below their season shooting percentages. In
six games against the Nets, the Celtics shot 38.6% and scored 92.7
points a game, nearly four points off their regular-season average.
The Nets will have their largest defensive issue at center, where
MacCulloch, Williams and Collins will deal with O'Neal, who is too
large and quick for any of them, assuming his arthritic toe is sound.
It is possible the Nets will send the stronger Martin at Bryant and
have Kittles defend Fox at small forward. The Lakers caught up to San
Antonio's Parker but never did subdue Bibby, and Bryant can't keep
bailing out his point guards. That means Fisher needs to be better
than he has been. For all the talk about Kidd on offense and what he
did to turn around the organization, the Nets are just as
dramatically better on defense, also because of Kidd, on the NBA's
all-defensive first team. Bryant was on the second team. The Lakers
probably will start with Horry on Van Horn and Fox on Martin, and
Bryant, Fisher, Hunter and Shaw will get their turns at Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   Rick Adelman disapproves of him, Red Auerbach annually disparages
him, and everyone else is properly jealous of him as Jackson keeps
producing championship seasons. He appears on the verge of his third
three-peat in 12 years, his ninth NBA title in 12 coaching seasons.
Auerbach won nine, and Jackson is no longer reticent to show his
pleasure at the prospect of catching--and someday passing--the former
Celtic coach. Jackson's playoff coaching record is 152-54. Pat
Riley's 155 playoff wins are the NBA record. Scott served two seasons
as Adelman's assistant in Sacramento and won 26 games in his first
season in New Jersey. Net management gave him some talent in his
second season, and Scott proved adept at a Riley-type regimen that
has the Nets believing in themselves. Still, he's not yet in
Jackson's league.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   KEY TO THE SERIES</TE>
<TE>   Though absolutely capable of overlooking an overmatched opponent,
it does not appear that the Lakers have come this far to do that. The
conference finals, however, might have left them weary, which would
make them vulnerable against the high-energy, chest-puffing Nets.
There is, however, only one player on the floor capable of dominating
both ends, and that is O'Neal, for whom the Nets have no defense. The
goal to win three consecutive championships, and leave a legacy that
someday will put his jersey beside those of Jerry West and Wilt
Chamberlain and others he calls heroes, drives O'Neal. Edge: Lakers.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Focused but Feeling Good After Victory</HD>

<DL>MIKUNI, Japan</DL>
<LD>Mexico's World Cup team returned Tuesday to its training base in this
seaside town on Japan's West Coast, where the road leading to the
practice field is lined with red, white and green banners and
enthusiastic posters declaring "Vamos El Tri!" and "LaLaLa! Mexico!"</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, "Ole! Ole! Ole!" doesn't quite translate here.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre was in a good mood, not surprising
considering the events of Monday: Mexico defeated Croatia, 1-0, on a
penalty kick by Cuauhtemoc Blanco, then watched upcoming opponent
Ecuador get besieged by Italy, 2-0.</LD>
<TE>   "We had a good victory," Aguirre said, "but the Mexican team
forgot about it five minutes after it was over. We're very happy
about yesterday, but today is another day."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said he and his team had turned their attention to
Ecuador, which plays Mexico in Miyagi on Sunday. Although Ecuador's
defense looked overmatched against Italy, Aguirre said he was
impressed with Ecuador's speed, especially on its forward line.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre was also pleased to welcome midfielders Jesus Arellano and
Joahan Rodriquez back to the eligible list. Both players missed the
Croatia game because of suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy for the first time to have all 23 players
[available] at the World Cup," said Aguirre, who acknowledged that
the "whole team will change" to accommodate the attacking skills of
Arellano and Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico can certainly use them. Against Croatia, Mexico was
organized and defended well but struggled to produce scoring
opportunities. Forward Jared Borgetti squandered one of the precious
few, finding himself unmarked in the front of an open net in the 34th
minute, turning and spraying the ball wide to the left.</TE>
<TE>   "There were lots of errors in the Mexican team when they got past
three-quarters of the length of the field," Aguirre said. "That is
where they have got to play better."</TE>
<TE>   Borgetti had Mexico's lone injury of a note, a bruised right ankle
suffered when he was kicked by a Croatian player.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For Blanco, his decisive penalty kick was an especially emotional
moment, the goal coming barely two weeks after the death of his
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco was very close to his grandmother, having lived with her as
a child. That was the reason, he said, for his long skyward glance
after scoring against Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco said he is dedicating the World Cup to his grandmother,
promising her he would score a goal for her the last time they spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Penner</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Fire forward Josh Wolff and Major League Soccer agreed to
a four-year contract extension worth at least $1.08 million.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff, with the U.S. national team, will receive the MLS maximum
salary of $270,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FIFA spokeman Keith Cooper said today it was unlikely that Rivaldo
would be given a multi-match ban for faking an injury during Brazil's
Group C game against Turkey.... Slovenia Coach Srecko Katanec said he
will resign at the end of his team's World Cup campaign because of a
verbal confrontation with the team's biggest star, Zlatko Zahovic.</TE>

<LD>Byron Scott gathered the New Jersey Nets around him before their
practice Tuesday afternoon at the Lakers' training facility in El
Segundo. It was good to be home, but it also was time to get down to
the business of preparing to face the two-time defending champions.</LD>
<LD>   Game 1 of the NBA Finals is tonight at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we understand that even though it's a homecoming for me,
it's also a business trip," said Scott, a former Laker guard and the
current Net coach, who grew up in Inglewood, in the shadow of the
Forum.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be very emotional for me [tonight]. It is home for
me. When I was here with Jerry Buss and Jerry West, it was the best
organization in basketball. It is going to be very emotional up until
the ball is tossed up."</TE>
<TE>   A number of Nets made similar comments. After all, Scott is not
the only one with a Southern California connection.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Armstrong, a reserve guard, went to Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Collins, a backup center, graduated from Harvard-Westlake
High in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Lucious Harris, a reserve guard, played at Long Beach State and is
a Los Angeles native.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jefferson, a backup forward, was born in L.A., but went to
high school in Phoenix and attended Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Scalabrine, a reserve forward, was born in Long Beach and
played at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn, a starting forward, graduated from Diamond Bar
High.</TE>
<TE>   None of the players has the ties to the Lakers that Scott does.</TE>
<TE>   He was, after all, an integral part of the Lakers' "Showtime"
teams of the 1980s, playing opposite Magic Johnson in the backcourt.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a fan of the Lakers when I was younger, especially in high
school," Van Horn said. "When they would win, I would jump up and
down in my parents' home.... I couldn't have dreamed it any better
than when I was 10 years old and dreaming of playing in the NBA
Finals. I'm here. Back home."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have cast themselves as the gutty little underdogs to the
Lakers in the Finals--just as the Sacramento Kings did in the Western
Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   When forward Kenyon Martin was asked to plead his case for a Net
victory to a majority of basketball fans around the globe who believe
the Lakers will win this series, he bristled.</TE>
<TE>   "Majority?" Martin asked. "It's all of them. It's everybody. If we
haven't proved to people that we can play at this point, we're not
going to do it. If we win, people will probably say it's just a
fluke. I'm tired of pleading my case."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott and Kobe Bryant played together with the Lakers for one
season, in 1996-97, Scott's last and Bryant's first. Scott recalled a
hyperkinetic Bryant arriving two hours before practice, dribbling a
basketball around in the dark while Scott took treatment simply to
prepare for the upcoming workout.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe is a great kid," Scott said. "He's a very special person."</TE>

<HD>Raiders Lose to NFL in Court Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that the Oakland Raiders
must share stadium revenues with the NFL's 31 other teams under the
league's revenue-sharing rules.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, handed down Monday by Judge Richard Hubbell, was the
second and final phase in a lawsuit that began last year. In May
2001, a jury in the same case concluded in the NFL's favor that the
Raiders did not "own" Los Angeles, and that the league had not
interfered with the Raiders' negotiations to build a stadium at
Hollywood Park in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   "We're pleased that the judge confirmed that the Raiders have the
same obligation to share revenues as do the other 31 clubs," said Joe
Browne, an NFL vice president. "We hope that this decision will end
litigation relating to the Raiders' departure from Los Angeles and
other contentious matters between [Raider owner Al Davis] and the 31
other NFL owners."</LD>
<TE>   Larry Feldman, a Raider attorney, disputes the NFL's assertion
that the Raiders have refused to share millions of dollars in stadium
revenues since moving to Oakland in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "It has never been the Raiders' position--and it isn't their
position now--that they wanted anything more than the other 31 teams
get," Feldman said. "They just want the same treatment as the other
clubs."</TE>

<TE>   Former NFL defensive lineman Jim Dunaway was ordered to pay his
children more than $500,000 in the wrongful death of his wife.
Dunaway was charged in 1998 two days after Nonniel Dunaway's body was
found by a relative in the half-empty pool outside a house she owned
in rural Marion County. An autopsy revealed that she had drowned. The
county coroner said the 56-year-old woman had been struck in the head
and was unconscious when she was placed in the water.... A Covington,
Ky., judge approved a mediated settlement between Cincinnati Bengal
kicker Neil Rackers and a man he was accused of assaulting at a
restaurant last year. In approving the settlement, Judge Douglas
Grothaus dismissed the assault charge against Rackers in Kenton
County District Court. Rackers and the alleged victim--Brian Stoehr
of Cincinnati--agreed to keep the terms of the settlement
confidential.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Redskins signed defensive tackle Santana Dotson,
one day after releasing defensive end Marco Coleman. Dotson missed
the end of the 2000 season with a torn quadriceps, but he returned to
play in all 16 games last year, starting 13.... Guard Glenn Parker,
who lost all five Super Bowls he played in, was released by the New
York Giants. The 35-year-old Parker, who started at left guard for
the Giants the last two seasons, played with New York in the 2001
Super Bowl and all four the Buffalo Bills lost from 1990-93....
Strong safety Damon Moore, who started the last three years for the
Philadelphia Eagles but injured his knee in last season's final game,
signed a two-year contract with the Chicago Bears.</TE>

<TE>   Former Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian has been
diagnosed with prostate cancer, the Las Vegas Sun reported Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The 71-year-old who retired in February from his coaching duties
at Fresno State was told last week that he is facing several weeks of
radiation treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman forward Andrew Zahn, a former standing at
Redondo Union High, has left the Arizona basketball team and will
transfer to another school, Coach Lute Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman, who hasn't made a cut in the U.S. Open since 1996,
and Jean Van de Velde, whose spectacular collapse cost him the 1999
British Open, both earned berths in this year's U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Norman shot a five-under 139 total to join John Huston and amateur
Kevin Warrick as the qualifiers from Old Memorial Golf Club in Tampa,
Fla. Van de Velde was one of 22 players who made it through 36 holes
of qualifying in Purchase, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Byrum had a five-under 138 and was the medalist at Purchase.
Others who qualified from New York were Jeff Maggert, Jay Haas, Craig
Stadler, Bob Tway and K.J. Choi.</TE>
<TE>   Former New York Met and Yankee pitcher Dwight Gooden, accused of
drunken driving in February, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of
reckless driving and was put on probation for one year.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Lisa Fernandez and five other Olympians were among 17
players selected to the U.S. softball team that will play in the
world championships this summer in Saskatoon, Canada. Leah
O'Brien-Amico, Laura Berg, Lori Harrigan, Stacey Nuveman and Michele
Smith are the other members from the 2000 Sydney Olympic team to be
chosen. Among those joining them are Arizona pitcher Jennie Finch and
UCLA players Amanda Freed, Keira Goerl, Lyndsey Klein, Tairia Mims,

<DH>Stanley Cup finals: Francis' goal in overtime lifts
Carolina, a heavy underdog, over the Red Wings, 3-2, in opening game
at Joe Louis Arena.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Red Wings can put away their brooms because they will not be
sweeping anything in this year's Stanley Cup finals.</LD>
<LD>   Carolina captain Ron Francis scored 58 seconds into overtime to
give the underdog Hurricanes a 3-2 victory over the Red Wings on
Tuesday in Game 1 of their best-of-seven series.</LD>
<LD>   The Hurricanes, who would have failed to qualify for the playoffs
if they played in the Western Conference this season, fell behind
twice to the heavily favored Red Wings, only to rally to send the
game into overtime to the dismay of the Joe Louis Arena capacity
crowd of 20,058.</LD>
<TE>   Once the game went into overtime, Carolina didn't waste any time
putting Detroit away, improving to 7-1 in games decided after
regulation this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, we feel comfortable in [overtime]," Francis said. "We
have had a lot of success in this year's playoffs when we've been in
that position."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina had not won in Detroit since the 1989-90 season--when the
team was based in Hartford as the Whalers--and was 4-16 against the
Red Wings over the last 10 years. The Hurricanes did not get off to a
good start.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina, which had not played in a week since defeating the
Toronto Maple Leafs in the Eastern Conference finals, was either a
little rusty, a little nervous or both early in the first period.
Several times, Carolina players mishandled the puck in their own
zone, but Detroit was unable to capitalize on the turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Arturs Irbe, who had the best goals-against average in
the playoffs before the game, was sharp. He stopped a couple solid
Red Wing chances, including a nice save on Boyd Devereaux in a four
on four.</TE>
<TE>   But the more Detroit pressured, led by grinders Darren McCarty,
Kris Draper and Kirk Maltby, the more errors Carolina made. After
failing to score on two first-period power plays, the Red Wings made
the most out of their third after Hurricane defenseman Glen Wesley
was called for an interference penalty at 14:56.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Tomas Holmstrom, who drew the penalty on Wesley, did not
pick up an assist on the game's first goal, but he definitely played
a major role.</TE>
<TE>   With Steve Yzerman shooting from the right point, Holmstrom
crashed the net and was pushed into Irbe by Carolina defenseman Aaron
Ward, leaving a wide-open net for Sergei Fedorov, who knocked in a
rebound goal at 15:21 to give the Red Wings a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Fedorov's goal seemed to wake up the Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   "We took too many penalties early but I think it was because we
were excited to be in the Stanley Cup finals," said Jeff O'Neill, who
tied the score at 2-2 late in the second period and assisted on
Francis' game-winning goal. "We just had to get our emotions in
check."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by a goal at the start of the second, Carolina gave the
Red Wings a golden opportunity to stretch their lead when the
Hurricanes were called for too many men on the ice, 34 seconds into
the period.</TE>
<TE>   But Detroit didn't stay on the power play for too long following
consecutive penalties on Igor Larionov and Draper, which led to
Carolina's first goal at 7:41.</TE>
<TE>   On a five-on-three power play, the Hurricanes were able to
distract Detroit goaltender Dominik Hasek just enough and defenseman
Sean Hill ripped home a goal from the left circle to tie the score,
1-1. For Hasek, who recorded shutouts in Games 6 and 7 against
Colorado in the Western Conference finals, Hill's goal was the first
he gave up in 143 minutes, 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   It took Detroit less than three minutes to regain the lead.</TE>
<TE>   After his linemates, Draper and McCarty, helped create another
turnover near the Hurricanes' net, Maltby gathered in a cross-ice
pass from McCarty and blasted in a shot from the high-slot to give
the Red Wings a 2-1 lead 10:39 into the second. It was Maltby's
second goal of the playoffs and 11th in 93 postseason games.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings, who were 9-0 when leading after two periods in the
playoffs, appeared to move into cruise control following Maltby's
goal, and their nonchalant attitude caught up with them. O'Neill took
advantage of a poor line change by Detroit and scored on a breakaway
at 19:10. O'Neill's shot was initially stopped by Hasek, but when the
goaltender tried to smother the puck with his body, he accidentally
knocked it into the net, tying the score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want go into the third period down, 2-1," said O'Neill,
who finished with a game-high six shots on goal. "We knew that if we
could tie it up, we would be able to maintain our system, rather than
being forced to press and take chances. With a team like Detroit,
it's not good to be behind late."</TE>
<TE>   In the third period, neither team dominated but Detroit did have a
power-play opportunity in the final 1:41 of regulation.</TE>

times, singled down the right-field line to bring home the final two
of three runs the Astros scored off reliever Bret Prinz (0-2) in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Bagwell, Richard Hidalgo and Julio Lugo each doubled and
singled as the Astros got 13 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Spivey homered and Steve Finley was three for four with a
triple and two stolen bases for Arizona, which lost for only the
second time in 30 games when leading after six innings.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 3, San Diego 1--Jeff Kent hit a three-run homer in
the first inning and the Giants won at San Diego to extend the
Padres' losing streak to a season-high six games.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth homer in two nights by the Giants, although the
Padres once again kept Barry Bonds in the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was aboard for Kent's homer after drawing the first of two
walks. He leads the majors with 67 walks.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 8, Cincinnati 5--Fernando Vina had three hits and Albert
Pujols hit a two-run homer at Cincinnati to lead the Cardinals past
the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals have won 18 of their last 24 games, putting the
pressure on first-place Cincinnati in the NL Central. The Reds have
led the division since April 16, but their five-game cushion is down
to one.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, Chicago 5--Alex Sanchez atoned for his ninth-inning
baserunning blunder with an RBI single in the 11th off Jeff Fassero
at Milwaukee as the Brewers defeated the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Hernandez led off the 11th with a single off Fassero (1-4)
and was sacrificed to second. After an intentional walk to
pinch-hitter Alex Ochoa, Sanchez hit a single off the glove of diving
shortstop Alex Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Corey Patterson made a good throw to the plate, but
Hernandez slid around the tag by Todd Hundley, giving the Brewers a
season-high five consecutive victories.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 5, Philadelphia 0--Josh Beckett lasted only three innings
because of another blister, but five Marlin relievers finished a
four-hitter at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Beckett gave up one hit, struck out five and walked two before
coming out with a blister on his middle finger. The 22-year-old
right-hander spent two weeks on the disabled list last month because
of a blister.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Montreal 2--Chad Hermansen hit a leadoff home run
against Carl Pavano (3-7), and Rob Mackowiak homered twice to lead
the Pirates at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   New York at Atlanta, ppd.--The first rainout in Turner Field
history halted the Mets-Braves game, a matchup of the top two teams
in the NL East. It will be made up as part of a doubleheader on Sept.
10.</TE>

<HD>Nets Are as Tough a Sell as Swampland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Nets will warily march today into the home of a team
they could maybe, possibly defeat in a difficult seven-game series.</LD>
<LD>   That team is the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   It is the New Jersey Nets' great misfortune that they are marching
in today to play the other guys.</LD>
<TE>   The ones who will beat the ba-da-bing out of them.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the NBA Finals, where every expert who thinks the
Lakers will enjoy a four-game sweep over the Nets is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   It'll be the Lakers in three.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are nice guys, feel-good stories, and a fertile ground
for cliche "Sopranos" references. But bringing them here after the
Sacramento Kings is like carting in an appetizer after a big dinner
and dessert.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are stuffed. The town is sated. Everyone is content,
and exhausted, and would like nothing more than to roll over and
sleep for a month.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers: "Excuse me, NBA? Now you want us to do what?"</TE>
<TE>   The NBA: "Please?"</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers: "Well, OK, seeing as it will only take a couple of
quick bites ... "</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are here tonight for Game 1 at Staples Center because
they were the best team in the Eastern Conference. That's nice and
all, but it's sort of like saying you own the prettiest building in
Newark.</TE>
<TE>   If the Nets played in the West, they would have barely made the
playoffs. The last time they played a series in the West, they were
swept in four games, with consecutive midseason losses during visits
to the Lakers, Phoenix, Portland and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   But at least they have those pretty cement-colored uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are basketball's only team named after a piece of
playground equipment, and dressed like a turnpike.</TE>
<TE>   They play in a Meadowlands swamp location so unpleasant, the NBA
is housing the media in a different state.</TE>
<TE>   They have a history so sordid, Phil Jackson played 75 games there,
yet is not listed on their alumni pages in the media guide, and
doesn't care.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to reflect on my days in New Jersey," Jackson said.
"Those were pretty bleak times."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets' all-time playoff leader in points scored is Buck
Williams with 380.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal have each scored more points this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think even the Lakers think we have a chance," said
Richard Jefferson.</TE>
<TE>   He's one of the Net players. Did you know that? Do the Lakers know
that?</TE>
<TE>   "I know all their players, you want me to go down the list?"
Robert Horry asked.</TE>
<TE>   Fine, who is their 12th man?</TE>
<TE>   "Donyell Marshall," he said, proffering the name of a forward for
the Utah Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous person in a Nets' jersey may be Joumana Kidd, the
noticeable wife of point guard Jason and a target of derisive chants
at previous playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   While their fans will be too polite to heckle, the Lakers can
provide enough harassment by seating her next to an apparently
unbathed Brad Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   The most important person in a Nets' jersey is Todd MacCulloch, a
pleasant 7-foot Canadian with the term-paper-sized assignment of
Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   MacCulloch had the same assignment in last year's NBA Finals for
the Philadelphia 76ers, a job for which the 76er coaches determined
he was so suited, he played for 31 of 245 possible minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Scored in one of the five games, though.</TE>
<TE>   This June, MacCulloch shows up with a new starting job and a fresh
inspirational message.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm big, and I have six fouls," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While O'Neal must shudder to hear such boasting, it won't work.
Against a team that doesn't flinch, nothing the Nets can do should
work.</TE>
<TE>   Before Kenyon Martin starts his tough-guy posing, he should
remember he's playing against a guy who has acted in a prison drama.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn's sleepy three-point shooting will barely rouse the
sleepiest three-point shooter in NBA playoff history.</TE>
<TE>   And if Kidd thinks the MVP bit will work, well, he should remember
that the Lakers have already defeated the league's real MVP.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets must attempt something unique to defeat the Lakers. In
hopes of witnessing a decent series, I offer these suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   They can surround Shaquille O'Neal and start chanting, "There is
only one way to describe you. It starts with F and ends with T."</TE>
<TE>   They can sneak into the Kobe Bryant's closet and hang up a Dodger
jersey with the name "Perez" or "White" written on the back.</TE>
<TE>   They can remind the Lakers that one more series win, and Mark
Madsen starts dancing.</TE>
<TE>   They can hound Jackson with a poster featuring Jeanie Buss' head
on Red Auerbach's body.</TE>
<TE>   Or, they can just introduce Jackson to Mitch Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   If all else fails, they can attempt to paralyze the Lakers by
convincing them that, no, seriously, this is Lucious Harris' real
face.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame, really.</TE>
<TE>   It's the biggest series of the year, but everyone in town is still
too wiped out from Sacramento to appreciate it, still too busy
breathing into a paper bag to notice.</TE>
<TE>   It's the final dramatic leap toward a three-peat but, barring
Coach Byron Scott's ability to fit into a uniform and turn back the
Rolex to 1988, it will feel more like a quiet stroll.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Lakers share this sentiment, trying to speak nicely
of the Nets at every occasion Tuesday, with O'Neal even heaping
respect on his opposing center.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you know Shaq gave you props?" someone asked.</TE>
<TE>   "As in airplanes?" MacCulloch replied.</TE>

<HD>Grubman's Shutout Lifts Cleveland to Title</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger Stadium officials may not have been in a giving mood
Tuesday--all balls hit into the stands had to be returned because of
a ball shortage, a terse pregame announcement warned--but Sylmar
High's defense didn't mind handing Reseda Cleveland the City Section
baseball championship.</LD>
<LD>   A crucial second-inning, two-base error--one of three Spartan
miscues--contributed to No. 15-seeded Cleveland's only run in a 1-0
victory over top-seeded Sylmar that marked the first
championship-game shutout since 1982.</LD>
<LD>   Byron Grubman pitched a three-hitter and scored as the Cavaliers
(21-11) won their first championship since 1982 and became the first
15th-seeded team to win a title since North Hills Monroe in 1988.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew we were better than the 15th seed, so we came in with a
lot of confidence," said Cleveland center fielder Trevor Arroyo,
whose diving catch with a runner on first ended the game.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman drew a leadoff walk in the second inning and took third
base when Jamie Mah's pickoff throw in the dirt sputtered past first
baseman Mike Garcia. Matt Jordan drove in Grubman with a sacrifice
fly to center field.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman (9-3) struck out four, walked two and allowed only one
runner as far as third base, when Mah doubled, moved to third on a
sacrifice bunt and was stranded in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia hit a first-pitch single to center to open the seventh for
Sylmar (27-5), which was trying to send retiring Coach Gary Donatella
out a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman struck out the next two batters before retiring David Luna
on a fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   In the City Invitational final, Ryan Braun hit a solo home run in
the seventh inning to lead Granada Hills (16-16) to a 5-2 victory
over Harbor City Narbonne (13-14).</TE>

<HD>Palm Desert, Van Heel Provide Day of Upsets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Palm Desert High boys' golf team turned a dream season for Santa
Barbara San Marcos into a nightmare Tuesday in the CIF-Southern
California Golf Assn. finals and Westlake Village Westlake senior
Brian Van Heel turned the fears of most top players into reality with
a career performance.</LD>
<LD>   Palm Desert, led by freshman Seann Harlington's 69, shot
five-under-par 288 at the SCGA Members Club in Murrieta to win the
team title by two shots over favorite San Marcos. The five-under par
is a tournament record and handed San Marcos its first defeat of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   Van Heel, in the tournament because Westlake qualified as a team,
shot a career-best four-under-par 68 and won the individual title by
a shot over Harlington, Kevin Larsen of San Marcos and Brady Baguio
of Bakersfield Highland. Van Heel, who said his previous best in a
competitive round was one-under par, surprised a field that included
more than a dozen nationally ranked players. The tournament pits top
players and teams from the Central, City, San Diego and Southern
sections.</LD>
<TE>   He started with consecutive bogeys but had five birdies and an
eagle. He hit 13 of 14 fairways and 17 greens in regulation to post
the type of score that top players fear in a one-round event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a strange feeling," said Van Heel, who became the first
Westlake player to win the title and will have his name engraved on
the same trophy that features the names of Tiger Woods, Phil
Mickelson, John Cook and Craig Stadler. "I didn't really expect this,
but in a one-round tournament anything can happen, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Including a Palm Desert victory over San Marcos, which dominated
the season and entered the CIF-SCGA finals with a five-player scoring
average of less than 360 in their last nine matches. The format for
Tuesday's tournament was altered to a four-player total to match the
girls' format, but will be changed back to five players next year. It
didn't matter Tuesday. Palm Desert would have shot a
tournament-record 356 and still won by two shots over San Marcos in a
five-player format.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew we had the capabilities to do this, but I didn't know we
would do it today," said Palm Desert Coach Tim Kabeary, who called
San Marcos the best high school team he had ever seen after finishing
two strokes behind the Royals in the Southern Section championships.
"We haven't had consistency all year."</TE>
<TE>   It is the third CIF-SCGA title for Palm Desert, which also won in
1998 and 1994. It also spoiled a bid by San Marcos to become the
first team to win both the Southern Section and CIF-SCGA titles in
consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's disappointing," San Marcos Coach Aaron Solis said.
"You're never going to be happy when you lose, but we didn't really
lose. We shot three-under par as a team and got beat. That is a
credit to Palm Desert."</TE>
<TE>   Henry Liaw of Hacienda Heights Los Altos, the reigning U.S. Junior
champion, struggled with exhaustion after playing a 36-hole U.S. Open
qualifier in the Bay Area on Monday. He got three hours of sleep
before the tournament. He shot 73 Tuesday and tied for 22nd place.</TE>

<HD>Riley Is Green, but It's Not With Envy</HD>
<DH>Basketball: His trademark of 'three-peat' still good,
former Laker coach would make money off L.A. win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRADY MacDONALD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Lakers win a third straight NBA title, former Laker coach Pat
Riley will likely join the celebration--all the way to the bank.</LD>
<LD>   During the 1989 playoffs, when the Showtime Lakers were seeking a
"three-peat," Riley formed a licensing group that officially
registered that phrase as a trademark. The Lakers failed to win three
in a row, but Riley's company--Riles &amp; Co.--held onto the patent.</LD>
<LD>   If the Lakers beat New Jersey in the best-of-seven series that
begins tonight, Riley's payday could be as high as $150,000, industry
insiders say.</LD>
<TE>   Riley, now with the Miami Heat, did not return phone calls seeking
comment. But at the time he secured the patent, he explained that the
"business proposition" first arose when he was with the Lakers, but
did not pay off until the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls pulled off
the trifecta in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   During the week to 10 days after the Bulls' third championship, 15
companies were licensed to use "three-peat"--or "3-peat," which Riley
also owns--on T-shirts, hats, pennants, backboards, towels and
posters.</TE>
<TE>   Laker and NBA officials say the team and the league have no plans
to produce any three-peat merchandise of their own, but third-party
manufacturers are expected to produce thousands of T-shirts and
trinkets, from bumper stickers to welcome mats.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of a Laker championship, Minnesota-based manufacturer
WinCraft plans to print, pack and ship up to 100,000 triangular wall
pennants--all bearing the three-peat slogans. And should the Lakers
take a three games to none lead or the championship-clinching game
becomes a blowout in their favor by halftime, 10 silk-screen presses
in Long Beach will begin churning out 6,000 T-shirts per hour.</TE>
<TE>   "You go gangbusters until the parade, and then you're done," said
John Allenberg of West Coast Novelty, one of four companies licensed
to print Lakers' three-peat T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   In all, approximately $3 million in three-peat merchandise will be
sold, Allenberg estimates, with Riley's take about 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Legend has it Riley didn't even coin the phrase, he was just a
shrewd speculator. Laker insiders credit Byron Scott, now coach of
the New Jersey Nets, with first uttering "three-peat" during the 1988
victory parade.</TE>
<TE>   Riley also patented "Four-ward"--"In case we won four in a row, we
also had the next year covered too," he said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Four-peat" has already been scooped up--by dozens of claimants,
including the Bulls and the NBA (but not Riley).</TE>
<TE>   Media coverage of Riley's patent triggered an onslaught on the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 1993. Sports fans filed 10
applications--at $210 a pop--for "Fourmidabull" and a dozen
variations on the "Quadrup-Bulls" theme.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Riley's New York Knicks were battling the
back-to-back champion Chicago Bulls in the NBA semifinals--a win-win
situation for Riley, as many journalists pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   Riley stood to earn about $57,000 if the Knicks won it all and
thousands more if the Bulls three-peated. The Armani-clad,
slick-haired Riley said he never saw a conflict of interest in his
capitalizing on the fortunes of one team while coaching another.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the American free-enterprise system," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Riley's trademark idea was hatched in 1988 after the Lakers had
won consecutive championships.</TE>
<TE>   "I was having dinner one night with a friend and the friend said,
'Why don't we just copyright it?'" recalled Riley. "And I said, 'Go
ahead.'"</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Jordan &amp; Co. completed the three-peat repeat and Riley
scored again. Riley has said he has never asked the Bulls--or the
Lakers this time around--for compensation for using three-peat in any
marketing or merchandising efforts because his licensing agreements
always have been with the NBA or third parties.</TE>
<TE>   Riley has said that all net proceeds from his three-peat licensing
contracts have gone--and will continue to go--to charity. But he
refuses to name any of the charities or disclose the amounts of past
donations.</TE>
<TE>   The list of modern-day major league teams that have three-peated
reads like a who's who of North American pro sports franchises: New
York Yankees (three times), Montreal Canadiens (twice), Toronto Maple
Leafs (twice), Chicago Bulls (twice), Boston Celtics, New York
Islanders, Oakland Athletics and Minneapolis Lakers. No NFL team has
won three straight Super Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the universal popularity of Riley's "three-peat" could
ultimately spell doom for his trademark-protected phrase. With the
help of sportswriters and fans, three-peat has quickly slipped into
the public domain of sports cliches that describe a distinct feat
(i.e. hat trick, shutout, triple-double). Once that happens, patent
holders no longer earn money off their use.</TE>

<LD>Kobe Bryant was at the microphone and journalist Arsenio Hall sat
directly in front of Kobe at Tuesday's news conference so he could be
seen. This was fine until Hall, still riding the success of the 1987
classic "Amazon Women on the Moon," opened his mouth.</LD>
<LD>   In between questions from the New York Times and the Los Angeles
Times, Hall asked Kobe, "Who gets double-teamed more, Shaq or Jenna
Jameson?"</LD>
<LD>   Kobe gave Hall the kind of look you'd expect from somebody who
apparently has never rented a movie in his hotel room, and therefore
had no idea Jameson was a porn star. For the record: I only knew
because the people in the hotel room next to me on my last trip
seemed real excited about getting the chance to watch one of her
videos.</LD>
<TE>   Hall, meanwhile, was left laughing at his own joke, making him the
only one in the room who was laughing, and I would imagine that
happens to him a lot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   YES SIR, the NBA Finals are underway, and every wacko, including
Fox Sports Net's screaming Jack Haley wants to be a part of it, so
it's going to be my task to document it all no matter what the
personal sacrifice, including a trip later to gloomy New Jersey. And
I thought it couldn't get any worse than playing 18 holes with sports
editor Bill Dwyre behind a fivesome of women.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be Lakers all the time now for at least the next
week, and if that means interviewing Salma Hayek at every game, I
would remind Ed Norton that's my job so back off.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to J-Lo, Britney and Charlize Theron: If you would like to
meet me, this is probably your best chance, as long as you can get
Laker tickets. As for Mimi Rogers, I could probably get you Laker
tickets if you want them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ANGELS seemed to take it very well Tuesday when I stopped by
Edison Field to tell them I wouldn't be around for awhile. In fact
Dennis Cook and Tim Salmon were so wrapped up in Maury Povich's
"Shocking Moments Caught on Video," I'm not even sure they were
paying attention when I bid everyone good luck. That reminds me,
though, if Salmon ever gets to .300, I'll send video to Povich.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Tim Mead, the team's spokesman, if the organization had
given any thought to canceling games when they conflict with the NBA
Finals, but I forgot the Angels are used to playing with no one
paying attention to them.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are in Colorado, but when I heard Kevin Brown hurt his
back, I was just hoping it wasn't because he was jumping for joy at
word that I was going to be preoccupied with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   To be honest, I'm not sure I could have thrown my heart and soul
into the playoffs if there was still a chance the Sparks were going
to go undefeated this season, but now there's no reason to watch
their games the rest of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Someone told me they televise the Stanley Cup finals, but I
figured they were just putting me on. I was holding out hope that
Dwyre might send me to them, but Lonnie White gets all the plum
assignments.</TE>
<TE>   My biggest disappointment is letting Mark Paredes down. Paredes,
the press attache for the Consulate General of Israel in L.A.,
extended an invitation to join him Friday at 4:30 a.m. to watch the
World Cup match between England and Argentina because I presume he
couldn't find anyone else to go with him.</TE>
<TE>   I offered Paredes my wife, but I guess he must have heard what
she's like early in the morning because I haven't heard back from
him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NEXT week or so is going to be just miserable because all
these sports writers from New York are going to be around, and they
either take things very seriously or make things up so they get a big
headline on the back of the paper. None of them have a sense of
humor, so imagine spending a whole week in close quarters with a
bunch of USC fans.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in Arsenio, Haley huffing and puffing about his days sitting
on the same bench with Phil Jackson, lost time in New Jersey and I'm
going to be ready for a vacation after the Laker victory parade. By
the time I get back, I'm afraid the World Cup will be over. I just
hope the same can't be said for the Angels' and Dodgers' seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ANGEL MANAGER Mike Scioscia had his pitchers take batting practice
in preparation for playing the National League, but even though Troy
Percival began his career in the minor leagues as a catcher, he will
not be allowed to pick up a bat.</TE>
<TE>   "They saw him hit when he was a catcher; that's why he's a
pitcher," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Percival is 0 for 1 in the majors. He tried bunting. On the first
pitch his hand got stuck in pine tar. Strike one. On the second
pitch, "I turned and I swore the ball was coming right between my
eyes," he said. Strike two.</TE>
<TE>   On the third pitch, he put the bat out, but got nothing but strike
three.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I FIGURE the Nets will double-team Kobe, try to keep the role
players in check while letting Shaq dominate inside. I've got the
Lakers winning four straight, and some folks in Sacramento moving to
L.A. so they can cheer for a champion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from J. Scott Davis:</TE>
<TE>   "Your article on Phil Jackson was not well thought out, and lacked
basic journalism skills. Jackson was pushing his players to dig
deeper in the draining series against the Kings and not because your
colleague, Bill Plaschke, instructed him to do so. I request you
apologize to Phil, the Lakers, and us readers."</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry, I forget sometimes how smart some of you are.</TE>

<DH>Figure skating: Several judging reforms are proposed to the
ISU Congress, all heavy on crunching numbers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KYOTO, Japan</DL>
<LD>Ladies and gentlemen, start your calculators.</LD>
<LD>   With cries for reform filling their posh meeting room, delegates
to the International Skating Union Congress heard an array of
proposals today designed to restore the integrity figure skating has
lost since the Salt Lake City Olympic judging scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Presentations made by the U.S., Australia, Canada and the ISU
described a dizzying variety of alterations to the scoring and
judging systems, but there was no consensus on the form or extent of
such changes.</LD>
<TE>   Although ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta vowed "next season the
rules will be different than the ones we have today in the book,"
most participants were cautious in assessing the merits of the
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "At this moment, there are more questions than answers," said
Sergei Sviridov of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   No vote was taken this morning, because the host Japanese Skating
Federation took delegates on a sightseeing trip. Discussion was to
continue Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have an opportunity and obligation to make the changes
necessary to make sure our sport is fair and understandable to
everybody," said Phyllis Howard, president of the U.S. Figure Skating
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The key points of the USFSA proposal are ranking skaters based on
a median mark, and selecting judges from five geographical zones to
guard against cultural bias. Judges would be required to justify
their evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   A computer would randomly select seven of 10 judges' marks for
each skater or pair. To obtain a median mark, each judge's scores
would be added to get a total. A computer would weight the first mark
in the short program and the second mark in the long program. The
high and low total scores would be eliminated to determine the
median.</TE>
<TE>   Each portion of the proposal will be evaluated separately, leaving
open the possibility of compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Using the median mark, USFSA Executive Director John LeFevre said,
"will make it very difficult for one or more judges to be acting in
bad faith."</TE>
<TE>   Sviridov said he liked the U.S. proposal, but Wolfgang Kunz of
Germany thought it too imprecise. "I don't see any reason to change
the calculating system to the USFSA way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Australia proposed having each event judged by 14 judges, but only
nine scores, randomly selected by computer, would count toward the
final score. The two highest and two lowest marks would be deleted in
the short and long programs. The remaining marks would be displayed
on the scoreboard in the arena. In each program, the technical marks
would be added to the presentation marks to calculate a final score.</TE>
<TE>   "It is simple, clear and easily understood by everybody....," said
Don McKnight, president of Ice Skating Australia. "The system
practically inhibits any kind of possible deals or influences among
the judges."</TE>
<TE>   The ISU proposal is by far the most radical.</TE>
<TE>   In its current form--which is subject to change--judges using
computer touchpads would give skaters points based on a scale of
merit determined by ISU experts. For example, values could be set at
4.0 for a triple toe loop, 4.4 for a triple salchow, 1.4 for a sit
spin, etc. Judges would also add points for a move done well or
subtracting for flaws.</TE>
<TE>   Judges would give a second mark for basic skills and presentation
skills, using a scale of 0.1 to 6.0. The technical and presentation
scores would be added to compute a final score.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal was greeted with many questions, but it had support.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that evaluations are put on different elements is good,"
said Morry Stillwell of the U.S., chairman of the Grand Prix
Management Commission.</TE>
<TE>   However, other delegates expressed doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Canada backed the ISU initiative but suggested an interim system
while the ISU system is developed.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's plan called for a random draw of 14 judges and use of
only nine marks and ordinals to calculate the final result. The marks
would not be made public.</TE>

<HD>South Korea Cashes In</HD>
<DH>Group D: Goals by Hwang and Yoo beat Poland, 2-0, in
country's first World Cup victory in 15 attempts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>South Koreans celebrated late into the night Tuesday after their
country won its first World Cup game in 15 attempts dating to 1954.</LD>
<LD>   Goals by Hwang Sun-Hong and Yoo Sang-Chul were enough to defeat
Poland, 2-0, in front of a near-sellout crowd of 48,760 at Asiad Main
Stadium in the seaport city of Busan. One of the fans present was
South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung.</LD>
<LD>   The victory puts additional pressure on the United States and
Portugal, who also are in Group D. The U.S. plays South Korea on
Monday in Daegu.</LD>
<TE>   The Koreans took the game to the Poles from the outset and it soon
was clear that the home team was not only better supported but also
much faster and technically superior. Poland looked slow and
ponderous by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang gave South Korea the lead in the 26th minute with a
stupendous goal. Left unguarded by the Polish defense, he had space
and time to volley Lee Eul-Yong's cross from the left powerfully into
the back of the net past stunned Polish goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek.</TE>
<TE>   It was Hwang's 50th goal for his country in his 98th national team
game.</TE>
<TE>   Yoo's goal in the 53rd minute was equally powerful as he unleashed
a shot that flew into the net off the diving Dudek's fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm delighted at the way we played," said South Korea's Dutch
coach, Guus Hiddink, who had coached the Netherlands to the
semifinals of the France '98 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a historic game for Korea. The players have worked hard
and this victory was their reward. It wasn't just about the goals but
the concept of the way we played. They attacked from the first
minutes and I'm very proud of them."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, which had lost 10 and tied four of its previous World
Cup matches, could have won by a larger margin but for some near
misses and some fine saves by Dudek.</TE>
<TE>   Poland had not qualified for the finals since 1986 and it showed.</TE>
<TE>   "The absence contributed to our defeat," Coach Jerzy Engel said.
"Sometimes it is like that after 16 years. Our players maybe thought
that they had done everything they had to do when they qualified, but
it is not like that.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always going to be very, very difficult to play the host
nation in the opening game."</TE>
<TE>   With the game secured and only a couple of minutes left, Hiddink
made a nod of recognition to South Korea's all-time best player, Cha
Bum-Kun, by sending his 21-year-old son, Cha Doo-Ri, into the game.</TE>
<TE>   It was a night when many South Koreans were chanting and marching
through the streets long after midnight.</TE>

<LD>There's breaking news from the Psychic Readers Network: An
astrological disturbance was detected Tuesday night around Dodger
Stadium, which helps explain how 15th-seeded Reseda Cleveland High
went from fourth-place finisher in West Valley League play to City
Section champion.</LD>
<LD>   The stars were so perfectly aligned that the most famous Cavalier
of all, two-time Cy Young Award winner Bret Saberhagen, was handing
out the post-game awards after watching his alma mater defeat Sylmar,
1-0, almost 20 years to the day he pitched a no-hitter and recorded
the last shutout in City final history.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pretty amazing," Saberhagen said.</LD>
<TE>   Turning in a historic pitching performance was senior Byron
Grubman, who threw his second consecutive shutout and allowed one run
in 21 playoff innings. Only 5 feet 10 and 165 pounds, Grubman
outdueled Jamie Mah to upset the top-seeded Spartans (27-5), who had
won 20 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a fantasy come true, throwing a shutout at Dodger
Stadium in my last high school game," he said. "I couldn't ask for
anything more."</TE>
<TE>   As much as the game will be remembered for Grubman's pitching, it
was the defensive play of Cleveland shortstop Robert Marcial that
also left a lasting impression. There are major league teams that
could use a shortstop with the accuracy and skills of Marcial, who
had six assists and is headed to Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tremendous defense," Grubman said. "They played so well
behind me. It's such a pleasure having [Marcial] at shortstop. He's
so automatic."</TE>
<TE>   Marcial had someone looking out for him all season--his
grandparents. They have been in a coma since an automobile accident
six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wish they could be here," he said. "They've been my
inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   When freshman center fielder Trevor Arroyo made a diving catch for
the final out with the tying run on base, it was another example of
how the Cavaliers were always in the right place at the right time
during the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I found it in my glove and it was an awesome feeling," Arroyo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Saberhagen was raving afterward about Grubman, whose only baseball
offer is from UC San Diego. "He's got all the tools," Saberhagen
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Most underrated player: Pitcher Travis Sutton of Division I
champion Camarillo, who went 14-0 and is still an unsigned college
prospect.</TE>
<TE>   In need of glowing fingers: During a night game, Chatsworth
pitcher Justin Cassel was having trouble seeing the signs of catcher
Jordan Sisson, who went into the dugout and put red nail polish on
his fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Strikeout king: Roosevelt left-hander Ricky Romero struck out 162
batters in 80 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Impressive seasons: Junior catcher Trey Ursich of San Pedro Mary
Star of the Sea had 13 home runs and 44 runs batted in after a
sophomore season in which he hit 16 home runs and drove in 56 runs.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball nut: Pitcher Bobby Paschal of West Hills Chaminade
included the following quote under his school yearbook photo: "A man
once told me to walk with the Lord. I'd rather walk with the bases
loaded."</TE>
<TE>   Most improved player: Third baseman Daniel Lee of Woodland Hills
El Camino Real. As a freshman, he was cut from junior varsity. As a
junior, he led West Valley League champion El Camino Real with a .487
batting average.</TE>
<TE>   Best individual performance: Pitcher Mike Peck of Irvine
Woodbridge threw a perfect game with 15 strikeouts against Newport
Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Top sophomores: 1. Pitcher Andy Beal, Palos Verdes Peninsula; 2.
First baseman Mark Trumbo, Villa Park; 3. Pitcher Jason Corder,
Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley; 4. Pitcher Jason Dominguez,
Chatsworth; 5. Pitcher Trevor Plouffe, Encino Crespi; 6. Infielder
Sean Rooney, Anaheim Esperanza; 7. Infielder Garrett Green, Anaheim

<LD>Get ready to hear more of Bill Walton than usual. Fellow NBC analyst
Steve "Snapper" Jones will miss tonight's game to attend his
daughter's high school graduation in the Portland, Ore., area.</LD>
<LD>   Walton, on a conference call with reporters Tuesday, said: "The
Lakers didn't get it done in the regular season. They took it off.
The lackadaisical approach hurt them and I think that could be a
factor here.... If the Nets can get the Lakers to play a speed game,
they have a chance."</LD>

<TE>   The national rating for Game 7 of the Western Conference finals
was a 14.4 with a 24 share and the national audience was estimated at
46 million, the most to watch an NBA game since the Finals two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although the national rating was less than the overnight rating of
16.9, it was still the highest rating ever for a Western Conference
final game.</TE>
<TE>   NBC concluded the preliminary rounds with an average rating of 5.6
with a 13 share for 31 telecasts. Last year, NBC averaged 4.9/12 for
30 telecasts leading to the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The TNT crew of Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley,
plus guest analyst Magic Johnson, will be at Staples Center tonight
for a special one-hour "Inside the NBA," airing at 5 p.m. A highlight
of the show will be a feature on Robert Horry and his 8-year-old
daughter, Ashlyn.</TE>
<TE>   Said Barkley: "This is going to be a really great series, a lot
better than people think. New Jersey has a chance.... I've been
looking at the matchups. [The Lakers] have more matchup problems. The
Lakers' only advantage is Shaquille O'Neal.... Kobe Bryant is going
to have to guard Jason Kidd--that is a great matchup. I'm going with
the Lakers in seven."</TE>

<KH>NBA FINALS NEW JERSEY VS. LAKERS SERIES REPORT/OTHER VIEWS</KH>
<HD>They're Barely on the Marquee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE VACCARO</AU>
<BD>NEWARK STAR-LEDGER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Out here, we are viewed with amusement, as just another set of droll
characters helping to break up the monotony of another perfect
78-degree day. We all wear headbands like Springsteen, circa 1984.</LD>
<LD>   We awls tawk like Carmella Soprano, circa 2001. We are swamp
creatures, Turnpike trolls, Bon Jovi fans.</LD>
<LD>   We are the very special guest stars in this perfectly crafted
screenplay. Out here, you see, they recognize that the Lakers are
playing the NBA Finals. And that the Nets--that's the name of the
team, right?--are merely playing the Foils. Turns out to be a league
rule: A second team is required in order to make the NBA's
championship round count for real.</LD>
<TE>   "New Jersey!" bubbles the hotel hostess. "Oh, I just looooove
Jason Kidd! He's soooooo adorable."</TE>
<TE>   Adorable? Yes, that's the way the basketball-spoiled populace of
Southern California has come to view these NBA Finals. The Lakers
themselves are careful to keep their comments perfectly bland and
vanilla.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant: "The Nets are a very, very, very good basketball
team."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox: "The Nets are very good." (You have to earn your verys
from Mr. Vanessa Williams.)</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson: "[Zen] develops a capacity to relax the middle brain
where you have to be able to function from if you want to use
decision-making abilities from the brain ... "</TE>
<TE>   (Trust us. That means Phil thinks the Nets are very good.)</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the town, of course, sees no compelling reason to
display such restraint. See, if the Nets thought they had credibility
problems before, if they're steamed because they weren't earning
respect from various and sundry Pacers, Hornets and Celtics these
last 61/2 weeks, then it will be impossible to calculate the levels
of disrespect rising through the smoggy skyline of L.A. these next
few days.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the locals are already preparing for certain inevitabilities:
Shaquille O'Neal feasting on the Nets' three-headed center mutation,
Aaron MacCollins. Kobe Bryant reminding every Net fan of John
Calipari's front-office savvy every time he rains a jumper on top of
Kerry Kittles. Mark Madsen granting permanent life to certain
Caucasian stereotypes with each dance step he unleashes at the
inevitable post-parade celebration.</TE>
<TE>   And this familiar refrain: Lakers in four. Well, I'm here to tell
you that the adorable Nets gleefully accept the challenge set before
them by the City of Angels. They are used to being overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   So Kenyon Martin doesn't even work up a good sweat anymore,
pondering affronts and slights: "I don't have to make my case. We're
here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So Jason Kidd just smiles and says, "We are not here on a paid
vacation, here to go Hollywood. We are not here to help our acting
careers."</TE>
<TE>   So the Nets smile when they hear all the sweep talk and say,
"We'll see."</TE>
<GT></GT>

guard Jason Kidd is easily the one the rest of the country notices.</CP>

<KH>BELMONT STAKES SATURDAY, 2 P.M., CH. 4</KH>
<HD>Place in History Is Riding on It</HD>
<DH>Espinoza, a man of humble beginnings, is a victory away
from the Triple Crown</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He spent his boyhood on a farm outside Mexico City doing man's work
with a child's hands, and never thought anything of it because, as
one of 12 children, that's what you did. The animals were fed by
sunrise, and by 8 p.m. all the children were asleep, or at least they
should have been, even if they were cold or hungry, which many times
they were.</LD>
<LD>   He was nurtured by these humble surroundings and a close-knit
family, but the ranch that had been in his family for generations
couldn't hold on to the restless boy. He had heard stories about
people making a name for themselves in the city, and wanted a story
of his own.</LD>
<LD>   A decade after he started racing horses--first on a whim, and
then, as a way to make a living--Victor Espinoza, 30, will get that
chance Saturday when he rides War Emblem in the Belmont Stakes for a
shot at the first Triple Crown sweep in 24 years.</LD>
<TE>   Until then, Espinoza will not allow himself to stray from the
highly-disciplined lifestyle that he learned as a child, and used to
become one of Southern California's top jockeys.</TE>
<TE>   He still rises at sunrise--to train at the gym he owns in
Pasadena--before driving to the track to work out horses. Even after
riding War Emblem to victory in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness,
Espinoza has maintained a full racing schedule at Hollywood Park. The
5-foot-2 jockey pauses just long enough to eat his one meal of the
day--he must keep his weight below 110 pounds--and falls into bed
exhausted each night by 9.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long day, and the schedule lasts all year," Espinoza said.
"It wears you down, but you get used to it."</TE>
<TE>   The Triple Crown is a uniquely difficult challenge, with horses
expected to run at three different distances, on three different
tracks, within a span of six weeks. The last jockey to win the Triple
Crown was Steve Cauthen, who guided Affirmed in 1978. Since then,
only seven colts have been in position to follow, most recently
Silver Charm in 1997, Real Quiet in 1998 and Charismatic in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Jockeys who have been in Espinoza's situation say the expectations
can be enormous, and the devastation can be equally overpowering if
race day does not go as planned.</TE>
<TE>   "For weeks I had this awful feeling, like my world had ended,"
said Kent Desormeaux, whose Triple Crown bid with Real Quiet came up
short by a nose against Victory Gallop. "It takes a while to get over
it."</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, Espinoza said, he feels relieved that he remains
relatively unknown on the national racing scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think about [the pressure]," he said. "I try to keep
busy so I don't have time to think."</TE>
<TE>   In some circles, he is considered more lucky than talented, the
thinking being that any competitive jockey could succeed with a horse
like War Emblem. And should War Emblem win, his controversial owner,
Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, and high-profile trainer Bob
Baffert will likely receive much of the attention.</TE>
<TE>   None of that bothers Espinoza, who prefers to relinquish the
limelight. He is the first to say that War Emblem is a rare talent
indeed, but he also defends his part in their success, noting that he
won the Derby and the Preakness with different strategies--taking the
lead in the Derby and staying just off the pace in the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   "I tricked them," he said of his competition in those two races.
"I had a plan."</TE>
<TE>   Espinoza first began making big plans as a 14-year-old who thought
there was no future in farming, certainly not a financially stable
one. He followed his friends to Mexico City where he managed to get a
job driving a bus. After six months, his mother convinced the
underage, underpaid and overworked bus driver to come home.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after his return, a wealthy businessman hired Espinoza to
look after his horses and eventually brought him to Hippodromo de las
Americas, the biggest race track in Mexico. Espinoza had been there
once before, as a spectator who quickly lost his money and interest.</TE>
<TE>   But when a trainer took an interest in turning him into a jockey,
Espinoza paid attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I decided that's what I was going to do with my life, I put
all my focus and energy into it," Espinoza said. "One day I woke up
and said, 'This is what's going to help me succeed in life.'"</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, at 20, he won with his first mount. Although he continued
to do well, he grew restless. Other jockeys shook their heads when he
told them about his plans to immigrate to Northern California in
1993. "You don't know the language or have any contacts," they warned
him, but Espinoza felt he had nothing to lose.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't expect that he'd have to hang around the stables every
morning for three months before someone gave him a break. But a break
was all that Espinoza needed.</TE>
<TE>   "The horses would run for him, some guys just have that gift, and
Victor had it," said Junior Coffey, a former NFL player and long-time
Bay Area trainer, who was one of the first to put him to work as an
apprentice jockey.</TE>
<TE>   Espinoza rode at Bay Meadows and Golden Gate Fields, and in 1995
shared top jockey honors with Hall of Fame rider Russell Baze.</TE>
<TE>   He stood out in other ways too. Because he kept to himself, he had
few friends. His aggressive racing style also set him apart.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt so alone," he recalled. "I didn't know what they [other
jockeys] were saying ... you know, typical locker room stuff, but you
feel frustrated and it didn't help I didn't know anybody."</TE>
<TE>   There was little forgiveness for mistakes, and there were many,
resulting in repeated suspensions by race stewards for reckless
riding.</TE>
<TE>   "He was talented, but he had a lot to learn," Baze said.</TE>
<TE>   After a long day of training, Espinoza found time to take English
classes at night before settling into his tiny room above the barn.
Many nights, the rambunctious thoroughbreds would keep him awake, and
he'd have to yell to quiet them down.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he had the opportunity to go to Kentucky to watch the
Derby. Although Espinoza was slowly improving as a jockey, he said he
never envisioned himself there.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be good enough to be one of those jockeys, but I
never thought I'd have a chance to race [in the Derby]," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   After an agent brought him to Southern California, Espinoza began
exercising Baffert's horses in 1996. Espinoza quickly rose through
the Southern California ranks and soon was riding many of Baffert's
best horses.</TE>
<TE>   His relationship with Baffert is typical of the roller-coaster
ride the profession demands.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Baffert gave him his first opportunity to ride in the
Kentucky Derby. But after Espinoza finished third on Congaree,
Baffert replaced him in the Preakness where Congaree ran third while
Espinoza rode A P Valentine to a second-place finish for trainer Nick
Zito. Espinoza went on to ride A P Valentine to a second-place finish
in the Belmont, in which Congaree did not run.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the business, you don't let it get to you," Espinoza
said of Baffert's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Espinoza's mounts won $3.7 million in 1999. In 2000, his mounts
earned $13.2 million, ranking him seventh nationally. In that year,
he won the Breeders' Cup Distaff aboard Spain, a 55-1 longshot owned
by Salman and trained by D. Wayne Lukas. Last year, his mounts earned
$10,394,906--11th best in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, his mounts have earned $6,728,425, second in the
nation. The $1-million Belmont carries a $5-million bonus for the
owner of the Triple Crown winner. He could earn 10% of the purse,
plus a $500,000 cut of the bonus.</TE>
<TE>   There are few signs of Espinoza's wealth--although he does own a
yellow Lamborghini. He rarely drives it, however, usually traveling
from his home in Monrovia in a sporty pick-up truck large enough for
his two Great Danes.</TE>
<TE>   He compares riding War Emblem to driving his exotic car, except
the latter doesn't have a vicious temper.</TE>
<TE>   The horse routinely kicks and bites, and needs two grooms to
handle him. Bobby Springer, War Emblem's former trainer, called him
"just plain ornery." Baffert said: ''He's hateful. I don't turn my
back on him."</TE>
<TE>   Although War Emblem won the Illinois Derby earlier this year, he
was not regarded by Springer as a candidate for the Kentucky Derby.
Three weeks before the race, he was sold to Prince bin Salman, who
struggled to find someone willing to ride the horse. Espinoza was
called in only after two other jockeys refused the invitation.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Espinoza first met War Emblem only two hours before the
Kentucky Derby, a "blind date"--as Baffert has called it--that could
have turned into disaster.</TE>
<TE>   That same morning, the glossy black colt who looked friendly and
tempting enough to pet, bit a security guard who tried to do just
that.</TE>
<TE>   Espinoza recalled approaching the horse cautiously, and looking
into a pair of menacing eyes. But the man who had been around horses
all his life, living with them, caring for them, did not hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   As others looked on uneasily, Espinoza reached up to the horse's
mane.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem didn't flinch, settling comfortably at the jockey's
touch.</TE>
<TE>   And Espinoza knew this was his horse to ride.</TE>
<TE>   "This horse was special, he just had this look in his eyes," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, two longshots have a chance to carry each other into sports
history.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seemed like it was meant to be," Espinoza said.</TE>

<HD>Bus Blast Kills 14, Hurts Dozens</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Terror attack in northern Israel comes during
visit of CIA Director Tenet, who meets with Arafat on security
reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>At least 14 people were reported killed early today when a car packed
with explosives blew up alongside a crowded bus during the morning
rush hour in north-central Israel, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens more were wounded in the blast, which came just hours after
CIA Director George J. Tenet met in the West Bank with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat to discuss ways to reshape the
Palestinians' tangled and ineffective security forces. U.S. officials
are demanding, among other things, that Palestinian police agencies
fight terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But in northern Israel this morning, the scene was a familiar one
of carnage. Bus No. 830, many of its passengers soldiers on their way
to work, was making its daily cross-country run from Tel Aviv on the
coast to Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee. At the Megiddo junction
about halfway along the route, a car presumably driven by a
Palestinian suicide bomber sidled up to the bus and blew up, police
said.</LD>
<TE>   Army Radio reported 14 people killed. Many of the dead were
believed to have been soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The car was a crumpled mass of metal, and the bus fared even
worse; little was left of it beyond a charred skeleton that was still
smoldering 1 1/2 hours after the blast. Bloodied debris was strewn
along the highway's median; emergency workers lined up black body
bags on the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   "The scene is very serious, this is an incident with a very large
number of casualties," northern Israeli police commander Yaakov
Borovsky told reporters. "A car drove alongside a bus, and the result
was very, very serious."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his security Cabinet
to discuss the attack, which overshadowed Tenet's efforts to defuse
tensions here.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the bombing, and as Tenet met with Arafat at his
Ramallah compound still littered with sandbags from this spring's
prolonged siege, neither Palestinians nor Israelis held out much hope
that the famously autocratic Palestinian leader would institute
profound reforms in his security bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat won't even change his jacket," said a Palestinian
government minister who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You think
he will change his Cabinet?"</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that the security apparatus has grown bloated,
Arafat agreed to trim the services from about a dozen branches to
six. He also called up a 73-year-old onetime general, Abdel Razak
Yehiyeh, from retirement to become security chief. Before the 1993
Oslo peace accords led to the creation of a Palestinian government,
Yehiyeh headed the exiled Palestinian National Army in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of the aging general over younger, more ambitious
upstarts such as Mohammed Dahlan, security chief for the Gaza Strip,
raised concerns that Arafat plans to keep tight control over the
forces by appointing a weak deputy.</TE>
<TE>   "Reforms that have no substantial change in strategy and policy
are worthless," said Raanan Gissin, spokesman for Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Both in Israel and in Ramallah, Arafat's headquarters, the
Palestinian security services are already regarded with varying
degrees of cynicism.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's government complains that Palestinian intelligence
officers are more interested in helping militants wage renegade
attacks on Israel than in cracking down on political violence.</TE>
<TE>   And on Palestinian turf--where suicide bombers often are
celebrated as martyrs and Israel reviled as an enemy--security forces
are often written off as corrupt and even, at times, as acquiescent
to Israeli wishes. Beginning in 1995, Palestinians watched their
security officers patrol alongside Israeli soldiers. Many
Palestinians were also disappointed when the security apparatus
failed to rise up in an organized fashion against Operation Defensive
Shield, Israel's five-week military incursion this spring into the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   In the thick of some of the region's worst violence in years,
Arafat spent five weeks besieged by Israelis in his sprawling
Ramallah compound during the incursion. The main entrance is still
choked shut by mounds of dirt and crushed cars, so a convoy of
American trucks made its way past a swarm of chanting protesters
Tuesday morning to the back door. Tenet disappeared inside for a
three-hour, closed-door meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat reportedly urged the CIA director to put a halt to Israel's
crackdown on Palestinian territory. For months, soldiers have
systematically clamped Palestinian towns under curfew, rounded up
hundreds of suspects and searched homes in an effort to head off
suicide bombings and find militants. Palestinian authorities argue
that the security apparatus can't do its job when the region is
paralyzed by roadblocks and lockdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has been struggling to coax the two factions back toward
peace negotiations but to little effect. Sharon, who is due in
Washington next week, has said that meaningful reform of the
Palestinian Authority is impossible as long as Arafat stays in power.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Sharon agreed to erect a series of walls, electronic
fences and razor wire along a stretch of the boundary between Israel
and the West Bank. The idea of a fence has long been anathema to
nationalistic Israelis and Palestinians alike. Israelis fear that
they will cut themselves off from lands they've worked for years to
settle, while Palestinians regard the fence as a further blow to
their freedom of movement.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions continued Tuesday in the countryside. In a village near
Hebron in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers killed a 16-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokeswoman said a crowd of villagers had attacked the
soldiers with rocks, and the Israelis fired into the ground to
disperse the crowd. The bullets sometimes ricochet, said the
spokeswoman, Yael Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian witnesses said the boy was standing quietly outside
his house when he was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Palestinians along a Hebron roadside threw
rocks at a pair of Israelis driving by. The driver was clobbered in
the head, lost control of the car and crashed into a post. The pair
survived the wreck, but their story was a reminder of yet another
sticking point: the seething resentment between Palestinians and
Jewish settlers.</TE>
