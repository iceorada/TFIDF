<HD>Hootenanny Showcases Millers' Talents, Charms</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good music rarely stays a secret forever. And for several years, the
husband-and-wife duo of Buddy &amp; Julie Miller has been a secret weapon
in the music of Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle, Victoria Williams and
other roots-leaning acts. At the Roxy on Monday, the Millers
performed their first local headlining show, finally revealing their
many talents and charms in a prestigious L.A. setting.</LD>
<LD>   The Millers are up for a Grammy tonight in the contemporary folk
album category, even as their folk-rock sound balances a touch of
ancient bluegrass and the jagged edge from Buddy's electric guitar.</LD>
<LD>   The nomination is a welcome tribute to music so rich and organic.
But the sound and community vibe of Monday's show were their own
reward.</LD>
<TE>   There were many quiet moments easily categorized as modern folk on
Monday, but the show opened with the up-tempo "Keep Your Distance,"
which blended warmth and dark humor. And "You Make My Heart Beat Too
Fast" was a brooding rocker, after which Julie admitted with a smile
that the song lifted the famous chord change from "Wild Thing."</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally Julie would exit the stage while her husband rocked
out on guitar with their band or sang a wise and forlorn song of
love. But the mixture of their voices, her bubbly persona and his
fiery playing provided the night's most memorable moments.</TE>
<TE>   The best songs were not those easily identified as rock or
country, but those moments when the boundaries blurred into
irrelevance.</TE>
<TE>   When Julie suggested that the band play something "folk," since it
was their category, a fan shouted back, "Your category is anything!"</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the show, the Millers' nearly two-hour set had
become a freewheeling L.A. hootenanny, with such guests as Harris and
Williams stepping on stage for a few songs each. Julie promised the
crowd, "You'll get your turn!" It could have gone all night.</TE>

<HD>O'Brien Signs for Another Four Years of 'Late Night'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conan O'Brien, who began his life as an NBC late-night personality
working under the skeptical gaze of his bosses and tenuous
months-long contracts, has signed a new deal to continue as host of
"Late Night With Conan O'Brien" for another four years. Terms of the
deal were not disclosed, although sources have said that O'Brien will
be making close to $8 million annually.</LD>
<LD>   The deal puts to rest speculation that O'Brien might jump ship to
another network, possibly Fox, which is alone among the major
broadcast networks in not having a presence in late-night comedy.
O'Brien has become a key component in NBC's late-night dominance,
regularly winning his 12:35 a.m. time slot, where "Late Night"
averages 2.6 million viewers and has garnered Emmy nominations for
its writing.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing the deal during a conference call with reporters
Tuesday, NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa indicated that the
network is also close to working out an agreement in which reruns of
"Late Night" would air on cable--a growing trend whereby networks,
looking to recoup costs in a sluggish advertising market, garner
additional revenue from their original series by repeating them on
cable outlets.</LD>
<TE>   A similar arrangement was among the factors that held up the
recent launch of NBC's "Last Call With Carson Daly," which follows
"Late Night" Monday through Thursday. Next-day reruns of the talk
show will begin airing on E! Entertainment Television weekdays at 6
p.m. beginning Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The natural spot for "Late Night With Conan O'Brien," several
sources said, is Comedy Central, where O'Brien's sensibility would
presumably work alongside programming that includes "The Daily Show"
and reruns of "Saturday Night Live," on which O'Brien once worked as
a writer. Discussions between NBC and Comedy Central on "Late Night
With Conan O'Brien" are said to be ongoing, though representatives
from both sides declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We have pretty specific reasons for doing Carson and Conan [on
cable]," Sassa said, including increased exposure for two
personalities whose shows run well past midnight.</TE>
<TE>   For O'Brien, meanwhile, the contract renewal comes as the latest
affirmation for a late-night personality who, back in 1993, was
plucked from virtual obscurity and given the vaunted time slot David
Letterman vacated when he took his late-night caravan to CBS. Since
then, O'Brien has won over critics and viewers alike.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very excited to be staying at NBC," O'Brien said in a
statement Tuesday. "By my 13th year, we should really know if this
thing works or not."</TE>
<GT></GT>

<LD>Who among the following is a Grammy nominee this year?</LD>
<LD>   A. Jimmy Carter</LD>
<LD>   B. Dr. Ruth Westheimer</LD>
<TE>   C. Steve Martin</TE>
<TE>   D. Ann-Margret</TE>
<TE>   E. None of the above</TE>
<TE>   F. All of the above</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course, it's a trick question.</TE>
<TE>   For the answer,</TE>
<TE>   see F7.</TE>
<TE>   If you guessed F, you are correct--and have a little too much time
on your hands to know such details. But for you casual fans, here's a
look at some oddities among this year's nominees.</TE>
<TE>   You may recall Steve Martin, early in his stand-up career, coming
onstage with a banjo, which at first seemed like a prop until he
actually played it. Turns out he's a dang good picker and he was
called upon for an all-star version of the classic "Foggy Mountain
Breakdown" (from the album "Earl Scruggs and Friends") that is
nominated in the country instrumental performance category.</TE>
<TE>   Ann-Margret, nominated in a gospel category? Last year a member of
the Light Crust Doughboys gospel group sent her some religious songs
he'd written and suggested she perform them with backing from his
group and from the legendary harmony ensemble the Jordanaires. The
singer-actress has said the result "is a part of me that I have not
had a chance to show." Well, "God Is Love: The Gospel Sessions" also
resulted in a nomination in the Southern, country or bluegrass gospel
album category. If she wins, we'll assume her acceptance speech won't
include a reference to her role in a recent touring production of
"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ruth? What? Did they add a "best sex advice recording"
category? The truth is even weirder: The diminutive doyenne of 'da
nasty is nominated in the spoken word album for children category for
"Timeless Tales and Music of Our Time." The stories include "Little
Red Riding Hood," which, come to think of it, does have a bit of a
sexual subtext.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Jimmy Carter is not on the nominated "O Brother,
Where Art Thou?" soundtrack. Though can't you hear him singing "I Am
a Man of Constant Sorrow"? He is nominated in the spoken word
category for the recording of his book "An Hour Before Daylight."
Maybe the third time will be a charm: He was previously nominated in
this category for "The Virtues of Aging" (1999) and "Living Faith"
(1998).</TE>

<HD>Maybe Her Time</HD>
<DH>Karrin Allyson, a nominee for jazz vocal album, has taken a
singular, determined path to success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karrin Allyson revealed no signs of Grammy anticipation as she strode
on stage last week at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill. Wearing a filmy lace
blouse over black pants, she simply joined her musicians and
immediately dug into a hard-grooving vocal interpretation of Benny
Golson's jazz classic "Whisper Not."</LD>
<LD>   She was appearing at the Hollywood venue in a booking conveniently
scheduled to bring her into town to attend today's Grammy Awards. For
the first time in a career that has seen the release of seven albums
over the past decade, Allyson has received a nomination--for
"Ballads," a tribute to the late John Coltrane--in the jazz vocal
album category.</LD>
<LD>   Bearing a striking resemblance to Michelle Pfeiffer's nightclub
singer in "The Fabulous Baker Boys"--a similarly unlikely blend of
blond, Middle American wholesomeness and cool sensuality--she elected
not to mention the nomination onstage, choosing to allow her singing
to stand on its own without external certification.</LD>
<TE>   Asked later how she was handling her feelings about the
nomination, Allyson shrugged and smiled broadly. "I know everyone
says it's an honor just to be [nominated]," she said, "but it's the
truth. I mean, look at the group I'm in--Shirley Horn, Mose Allison,
Kurt Elling, Dianne Reeves--wow! I really am happy just to be there.
I'm guessing that it's probably going to go to Mose or to Shirley.
They're the veterans, and they deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, for a singer who has been gutting out a career since the
late '80s--earning every step along the way--something more than a
nomination would be a very nice achievement, indeed. But, she
insists, if one of the "veterans" prevails, there's always next year.
And if one thing is clear about how Allyson has handled her progress
as an artist, it's that her undeniable musical skills are fully
matched by her inner toughness and determination.</TE>
<TE>   Her gig at Catalina's, for example, was typical of how she is
obliged to handle her bookings. Although concert performances
typically generate enough revenue to allow her to bring her regular
players--her "guys," as she calls them--the more limited budgets for
club dates generally mean that she must perform with local musicians,
supplementing the group with one or two of her key players. In this
case, her longtime guitarist Danny Embrey worked with a quartet of
L.A. musicians: bassist Tom Warrington, drummer Joe LaBarbera,
pianist Bill Cunliffe and saxophonist Bob Shepherd.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be difficult," said Allyson. "We had a quick rehearsal at
the start of the week, which in this case was easier, since I've
worked with Joe and Tom before, and they're hip to our approach. But
I'm always adding new material, and that can be a challenge, too,
which is why it's such a luxury to have Danny with me.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a girl singer just stuck in a band. I have a lot of
different kinds of things I like to do--Brazilian stuff, French
songs, bebop, ballads, and the guitar has become very important in my
repertoire."</TE>
<TE>   That diversity was on display throughout her set. Her affection
for Brazilian music surfaced with "O Barquinho (My Little Boat)" and
"Te Amo"; there were a few tunes from the Grammy-nominated
"Ballads"--especially a simmering reading of "Say It Over" and a
wordless vocalization of "Naima"; and a tribute to Mose Allison, via
his "Everybody's Crying Mercy." The sweetly lyrical quality of
Allyson's voice adapted with surprising ease to the darker aspects of
her ballads. And her improvising--sometimes in scat style, sometimes
via instantly invented adaptations of lyrics--was the product of a
knowledgeable musical perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "I love space in my music," she said. "And I get annoyed with
singers who are so in love with the sound of their own voice that
they never shut up to listen to what's happening around them. I mean,
this is chamber music, and we're having a musical conversation up
there on stage, which means there has to be space for everyone to
participate. To do that, there has to be complete agreement on what
we're playing, and how we're playing it."</TE>
<TE>   The required compatibility becomes especially evident about
halfway through Allyson's set at Catalina's, when she moves to the
keyboard to join the other players. With a bachelor's degree in
classical piano, she possesses ample technical skills.</TE>
<TE>   But what is more apparent is the manner in which she backs up her
talk about having space in the music. Laying down modest, unobtrusive
chording, tossing in an occasional reflective riff, she blends the
piano perfectly with her vocals, allowing the lyric line to breathe
while, at the same time, enhancing and supporting the story that the
song is telling.</TE>
<TE>   "I take it as a real compliment when people say I come from a
musician's point of view," Allyson said. "But I've also had to do a
lot, all my life, that didn't directly have anything to do with the
music. Like when you start out, and you have to market yourself.
Musicians hate to do that. But I've done so willingly and
wholeheartedly."</TE>
<TE>   And what she continues to have to do, since Allyson notes that she
is currently without a manager.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have used a really good manager a few years ago, and I
still don't have one," she said with a resigned sigh. "But there are
reasons for that, the primary one being that I haven't met anyone who
does it better than I do. I know they're out there; I just haven't
met them yet. And I'm super cautious since I've had some bad
experiences along the way."</TE>
<TE>   Allyson's refusal to remain stuck in the sort of unfortunate
professional situations that have handicapped the careers of many
singers is the product of a self-reliance dating back to her earliest
years as a performer. Born in Great Bend, Kan., the thirtysomething
Allyson studied classical piano at the University of Nebraska, but
she quickly realized it wasn't a track she intended to pursue as a
lifetime occupation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty good," she recalled, "but I'm a very social person,
and it just involved too much time alone."</TE>
<TE>   When she discovered Nancy Wilson via a classic pairing with
Cannonball Adderley on a single tune--"Sleeping Bee"--Allyson saw a
new territory beckoning.</TE>
<TE>   "First, I put together a little jazz combo," she said, "then I
started to date a horn player. After that, I was in a rock 'n' roll
band, I was in a Hawaiian band, and I was doing a lot of solo vocals
accompanying myself on piano. I did a lot of nights that way--in gay
bars, restaurants, cocktail lounges, you name it."</TE>
<TE>   She then moved to Kansas City, outside the major media mainstream.
But, with its rich jazz history, the city had a powerful impact on
her music. It was there that she self-produced the first of her seven
albums, "I Didn't Know About You." (It was also self-released, though
it is now available on Concord, where she continues to record.) At
the time the first album was issued, Down Beat magazine described it
as "a portrait of an artist as a young woman with subtlety running
hot in her veins."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, New York beckoned, and Allyson now lives on the
Upper West Side with her companion, NPR commentator Bill McGlaughlin.
She has persistently chosen to explore her various musical interests,
despite the music business tendency to prefer that artists function
within easily identifiable categories. The album before "Ballads,"
for example, was "From Paris to Rio," in which she applied her own
inimitable style to a collection of French and Brazilian songs.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it feels to me as though, 'OK, I'm going here, and now
I'm going there, and now I'm going somewhere else,'" she said. "But
at the same time, I don't like to do the same kind of songs all the
time, and, thankfully, I get a lot of feedback from people saying
that they like to hear different things."</TE>
<TE>   Even here, however, the practicality that has driven her career
from the very beginning surfaced in her comments.</TE>
<TE>   "I always try to keep focused on what matters," she said, "which
is the music. But I also have to remember that the people I'm playing
for and the people I'm playing with--my audience and my
musicians--are important too.</TE>
<TE>   "After all," Allyson said, "I'm an entertainer. I'm not in this
for stardom. I'd like a certain amount of respect, and I'd like to
work less hard for more money. But if an audience doesn't like what
I'm doing, I'm probably not going to get much of a chance to be
heard. And the best thing about this Grammy nomination is that it
tells me that I'm being heard."</TE>

<HD>Two Former Clinton Aides Joining 'Crossfire'</HD>
<DH>Television* Political strategists James Carville and Paul
Begala are replacing Bill Press, who will become a political
contributor for CNN.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bill Press, the former KABC talk radio host and chairman of the
California State Democratic Party who has been arguing the "left"
side of issues on CNN's "Crossfire," is being replaced by former
Clinton insiders James Carville and Paul Begala.</LD>
<LD>   The two one-time advisors and political strategists for President
Clinton will rotate in the job at the venerable political debate
show. The change comes as the show, currently a half-hour program
that originates in a CNN studio, gets set to expand to an hour in
April and move to a new home in front of a live audience at George
Washington University.</LD>
<LD>   The shift marks an attempt to revitalize the franchise and improve
its lagging ratings. Robert Novak and Tucker Carlson will continue to
trade off arguing the position on the "right."</LD>
<TE>   Press, meanwhile, will become a political contributor to the
network. CNN has just added an 8 p.m. half-hour rebroadcast of
"Crossfire," and the program, which airs at 4:30 p.m. Pacific time,
will begin a half-hour earlier when the expansion takes place.</TE>
<TE>   The new hosts are the latest change implemented by CNN in the face
of stiff competition from Fox News Channel. Starting some time in the
spring, the expanded "Crossfire" will be followed by a new program
hosted by Connie Chung, who is leaving ABC News.</TE>
<TE>   Although CNN's ratings are up from a year ago, Fox remained the
most-watched cable news network, on average, for the second
consecutive month in just-released results for February. Moreover,
"Fox Report With Shepard Smith" surpassed CNN's "Larry King Live" as
the No. 2 cable news show, according to Nielsen Media Research data.</TE>
<TE>   According to ratings for a total-day, 24-hour basis, Fox drew an
average 661,000 viewers to CNN's 514,000 and MSNBC's 337,000 for the
month. Fox also ranked first in prime time, where "The O'Reilly
Factor" (2.09 million viewers on average) remained the top cable news
show, followed by Smith, who drew an average 1.29 million viewers to
King's 1.26 million. CNN said King's ratings were negatively affected
by having to go head to head with NBC's Winter Olympics coverage.</TE>

<HD>Viewers, It's Time to Wake Up and Smell the Mergers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A few years ago, some time after a corporate marriage made local AM
news-radio stations KNX (1070) and KFWB (980) part of one big family,
on-air promotion for the stations subtly changed. Sure, they still
ran the usual "We're L.A.'s No. 1 news station" ads, but the nastier
"We're No. 1, and the other guy stinks"-type spots quietly
disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the way of the sneaky world of media consolidation, where
old-fashioned, bare-knuckled competition grudgingly gives way to
attempted "synergy," as companies that bring us news, information and
banal sitcoms keep getting bigger and more powerful, while
simultaneously trying to use their various assets to prop up and
support each other.</LD>
<LD>   A few titans already control the majority of television programs
you see as well as the channels over which they're delivered, and a
recent federal court ruling will probably clear the way for further
concentration of media ownership--particularly in regard to TV
stations, aping the merger mania that has transformed radio.</LD>
<TE>   It's equally clear that when this subject comes up, you can sense
eyes glazing over and hands fumbling for the sports section or
crossword puzzle--in part, one suspects, because you practically need
physicist Stephen Hawking to explain how the regulations work. So
with more shaking and merging to come, here's another, perhaps futile
attempt to explain why people should care about this issue, and why a
passing knowledge of who owns what is important not only to one's
role as a TV viewer, but, without sounding too melodramatic, also as
a citizen.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, media consolidation will cost some of your friends
and neighbors their jobs. In Los Angeles, three companies own or have
pending agreements under which they will operate a pair of local TV
stations--a situation known as a "duopoly"--with Fox parent News
Corp. running KTTV (Channel 11) and KCOP (Channel 13), Viacom buying
KCAL (Channel 9) to go with KCBS-TV (Channel 2), and NBC coupling
KNBC-TV (Channel 4) with Spanish-language Telemundo's KVEA (Channel
52).</TE>
<TE>   The driving force behind these deals--and there will be more like
them if the current Federal Communications Commission behaves as
expected--is the possibility of running stations more
cost-effectively, which means phasing out overlapping staff. It also
probably means less devotion to local programming and news, with many
stations in smaller cities having already eliminated news operations.</TE>
<TE>   This is occurring even though broadcast stations are allegedly
obligated to serve "the public interest," a term with about as much
relevance in the current regulatory environment as "buggy whip
maintenance." Yet however quaint that goody-two-shoes phrase may
sound, all it really means is that TV stations come to you over (and
make lots of money from using) publicly licensed airwaves and, as a
result, ought to give something back to the community other than
televised freeway chases and reruns of "Just Shoot Me."</TE>
<TE>   On a broader level, media companies are powerful and influential.
The news and information they choose to convey helps set the
political agenda, and the entertainment they distribute establishes
trends ranging from hairstyles (although that Jennifer Aniston
"Friends" thing is so yesterday) to fashion to women wanting to
stretch the wrinkles out of their face like an old blouse.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one reason people don't generally care about media
consolidation, suggests Jeff Chester, executive director of the
nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, is that television--the
principal source of news for a majority of Americans--has devoted
virtually no coverage to the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The principal messenger that informs the public has a conflict
here and has not informed the public [as to] what is going on," said
Chester, noting that the companies that control the industry's
leading news outlets are the beneficiaries of deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Even newspapers, as a coalition of lobbyists out to preserve
regulatory safeguards recently said, are now often conflicted when it
comes to fulfilling their traditional watchdog role in policing other
media, because many papers are owned by the same major media
companies--including this one, whose corporate parent, the Tribune
Co., also owns KTLA (Channel 5) and part of the WB network.</TE>
<TE>   In some cities, newspapers and television stations are forming
cooperative relationships to pool news-gathering resources, turning
them into partners instead of competitors--a pattern that can and
will probably exist under TV duopoly situations as well. Some
newspapers have gone so far to avoid the appearance of conflict as
ceasing to review programs on sister stations or even their rivals,
though it's hard to see how that serves readers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the apparent glut of available options, then, it's
possible that consumers will actually receive less choice, under a
less competitive environment, with less diverse viewpoints--or at
least less criticism and analysis of the programming they see.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, it's hard for many to fathom how this can be a
significant issue in a world that has room for individual channels
devoted to gardening, food, golf and science fiction, plus three
all-news cable networks--including one, Fox News Channel, that
pointedly positions itself as a counterpoint to the others' perceived
liberal bias.</TE>
<TE>   Because so many channels pass through the same corporate funnel,
however, the question of true diversity merits legitimate
consideration. Think of the cable box or satellite dish as a
magazine, where there are dozens of separate stories but all
ultimately pass through the same editor. That's not too far, really,
from the situation in the media, where there are countless programs,
channels and delivery methods but a mere handful of filters and
copyright holders.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, if for no other reason, the reshaping of the media
landscape bears watching because all the corporate machinations,
Washington power-brokering, multibillion-dollar deals and questions
of conflict and eroding journalistic standards amount to quite a
show, although most of you wonderful people in the dark--to quote the
aging and addled star in "Sunset Blvd."--are sleeping through it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's good news for the media barons, who have
investment bankers cheering from the wings, rooting for them to
launch a splashy revival of "The Big Media Merger" follies. Media
owners still need the patronage of consumers, too, to watch and
embrace their programming, but they'll breathe a sigh of relief if
this new big-budget revue proceeds just like the last one, without
the public giving it so much as a second thought.</TE>

<HD>After the Pyramids, a New Kingdom</HD>
<DH>'Egypt's Golden Empire,' tonight on PBS, explores a
civilization that later served as a model for Greeks and Romans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of these days, Hollywood will make a movie about Egypt's New
Kingdom. It's a magnificent story about redemption, power, greed,
revenge, religion and decline, all set in the world's first genuine
empire.</LD>
<LD>   Until then, "Egypt's Golden Empire," appearing tonight on PBS,
provides an acceptable substitute. Using documents from the period
and a little bit of creative filmmaking, the program brings to life
one of the most intriguing periods of Egypt's vast history. Over a
400-year span, Egypt's New Kingdom kicked out two groups of foreign
invaders, expanded its empire to include much of the Near East,
created wealth beyond all previous imagining, established a new
religion--and ultimately fell apart in greed and bickering.</LD>
<LD>   The story began around 1570 BC, more than 1,000 years after the
pharaohs of Egypt's Old Kingdom had built the pyramids and the
Sphinx. Northern Egypt had been conquered by an Asian group known as
the Hyksos, and the Hyksos king had declared himself pharaoh.
Southern Egypt was ruled by the Nubians, who had pushed northward
from Central Africa.</LD>
<TE>   The Egyptians had been reduced to a small tribe occupying Central
Egypt, led by an obscure pharaoh called Segenere Taa I. Segenere and
his army were brutally slaughtered trying to expel the Hyksos. The
Hyksos king then sent a message to the king of the Nubians, inviting
him to join with the Hyksos in trapping and conquering the remaining
Egyptians.</TE>
<TE>   Intercepting the message, Segenere's oldest son Kamose organized
another army and captured the first Hyksos town he encountered. He
died before he could go any further, leaving behind only his
10-year-old brother Ahmose. By the time he was 20, Ahmose had
strengthened the army and attacked the Hyksos capital of Avaris,
expelling the foreign invaders.</TE>
<TE>   He then turned his attention southward, expanding his borders well
into Nubia and--most important--capturing the rich Nubian gold mines,
which would be a source of Egyptian wealth and power for centuries.
And that's just the first 15 minutes of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years later, on the death of Tuthmosis II, the crown fell to
young Tuthmosis III but the actual power fell to his stepmother and
co-regent Hatshepsut. Within six years, she had assumed full control
of the country and declared herself pharaoh, claiming (falsely) that
her father, Tuthmosis I, had designated her as his successor and that
the god Amen had briefly occupied her father's body when she was
conceived.</TE>
<TE>   Hatshepsut was the first known female ruler in history, and Egypt
grew in power during her reign, especially after a successful trade
expedition to the land of the Punt. But Tuthmosis III deeply resented
her coup and, when he finally assumed power after 20 years, erased
her name from every monument he could find, a pattern that became
common throughout the New Kingdom. Her name was lost to history until
1903, when archeologist Howard Carter stumbled on some artifacts that
Tuthmosis III had missed and began piecing together her remarkable
story.</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes, through a succession of rulers that included
Amenhotep III, Akhenaten, Tutankhamen and, ultimately, Ramesses II,
who reigned for 67 years. Ramesses survived so long, in fact, that he
outlived all the potential heirs whom he had groomed to take his
place, and Egypt began an irreversible downhill slide after his
death.</TE>
<TE>   Love Notes and Gossip</TE>
<TE>   from Common People</TE>
<TE>   Much of the story is recounted from details on steles and temples,
but a surprising amount of information comes from the everyday
writings of the common people: letters home from soldiers, intimate
love notes and poetry, raunchy gossip and even laundry and shopping
lists.</TE>
<TE>   One tomb-builder named Paneb, for example, was a complete rogue. A
letter from his son denouncing him notes that, at age 72, Paneb was
still causing mayhem in his village by sleeping with the wives and
daughters of other tomb-builders.</TE>
<TE>   The empire-building of the New Kingdom shaped the science, culture
and politics of the ancient world and served as a model for the
Greeks, the Romans and a host of other civilizations that came along
later. One could argue that, without the New Kingdom, the world would
be a vastly different place today. It's a movie script just waiting
to be written.</TE>
<TE>   "Egypt's Golden Empire" can be seen at 9 tonight on KCET. For more

<LD>   Crowe Lashes Out After Awards Speech Is Cut</LD>
<LD>   Actor Russell Crowe ("A Beautiful Mind") recited a poem--Patrick
Kavanagh's "Sanctity"--during his best actor acceptance speech at the
British Academy Film Awards dinner on Sunday. And he didn't take well
to the news that the BBC had eliminated the segment due to time
constraints.</LD>
<TE>   According to the London newspaper the Sun, the actor pinned the
show's director, Malcolm Gerrie, against a wall at the after-awards
dinner at the Grosvenor House Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Gerrie was talking to pop star Sting when two of Crowe's security
men escorted him to a storage room where the actor launched into a
tirade, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   He swore repeatedly at the executive who, he threatened, would
"never work in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks, which released "A Beautiful Mind," and the actor
reportedly apologized to Gerrie, who the studio acknowledged was
"shaken up a bit."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Initial, the production company headed by Gerrie,
said, "We think Russell behaved unreasonably. It is a live show and
has to be edited quickly. Other speeches had to be cut, as well."</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sorkin Targets the Real White House</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sorkin, creator of NBC's "The West Wing," says the entire
country--including his own network--is "pretending" that President
George W. Bush is competent and brave.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the New Yorker magazine, released on Monday,
Sorkin said that while the country was correct in "laying off the
bubblehead jokes" about its president during the war in Afghanistan,
the news media had gone too far.</TE>
<TE>   One example he cited: the NBC special "The Bush White House:
Inside the Real West Wing," which was hosted by the network's chief
news anchor, Tom Brokaw.</TE>
<TE>   "The White House pumped up the president's schedule to show him
being much busier and more engaged than he is, and Tom Brokaw let it
happen," Sorkin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The show was a valentine to Bush," he added. "That illusion may
be what we need right now, but the truth is we're simply pretending
to believe that Bush exhibited unspeakable courage at the World
Series by throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium or that he,
by God, showed those terrorists by going to Salt Lake City and
jumbling the first line of the Olympic opening ceremony. The media is
waving pom-poms and the entire public is being polite."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for NBC was not immediately available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Cher Takes Umbrage</TE>
<TE>   at Statue Cover-Up</TE>
<TE>   Cher took time out from publicizing her new album, "Living Proof,"
to deliver some choice words about U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft--specifically, last month's decision to throw curtains over
the bare-breasted statue "Spirit of Justice" and her skimpily clad
male partner "Majesty of Law," which have stood in the Department of
Justice's Great Hall since 1936. Ashcroft, who reportedly had
expressed discomfort at holding press conferences in front of the
statues, denies ordering the statues covered.</TE>
<TE>   In a phone call to the Washington Post, the singer acknowledged
that she's not "the bastion of good taste," but is concerned about
the direction in which the nation is moving.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we going to do next? Put shorts on the statue of David,
put an 1880s bathing suit on 'Venus Rising' and a shirt on the Venus
de Milo?," she asked. "If they start doing that, maybe they'll start
deciding what books are all right for us to read and we'll start
losing all of our freedoms. It's shocking.</TE>
<TE>   "If he doesn't want to make speeches in front of them, let him
make speeches somewhere else," she scoffed. "He's mobile."</TE>

<TE>   Lincoln Center Ready</TE>
<TE>   to Name New Leader</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln Center is expected to get a new president Thursday when
its board officially appoints Reynold Levy, currently head of the
International Rescue Committee. A search committee has already
recommended Levy to take over the $500,000-a-year post left vacant
when Gordon Davis resigned in September.</TE>
<TE>   Managing the city's most prominent arts center has proven to be a
different job because of the need to mediate among its 13 constituent
organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera and New York
Philharmonic, and the board, headed by former opera star Beverly
Sills.</TE>
<TE>   Levy, who previously headed the city's 92nd Street Y, will take
office while Lincoln Center is trying to finance a $1.2-billion
redevelopment project during a difficult time for fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Previews of "Occupant," a new two-person play by Edward Albee
about sculptor Louise Nevelson, are on hold until its star, Anne
Bancroft, recovers from pneumonia. She is expected to return to the
off-Broadway show March 19 and appear during the last three weeks of
the run.</TE>

<HD>A Race Heads in Unknown Direction</HD>
<DH>The directors' contest, no longer linked to the best
picture award, is again wide open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking like an unmade bed, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of
the Ring" director Peter Jackson ambles barefoot into a small dining
room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills for an intimate
luncheon with a dozen or so local journalists. It's part of what he
calls "Phase 2" of the Oscar campaign on his mega-budget trilogy's
first part, which has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards, including
best picture and director.</LD>
<LD>   Phase 1 was before the announcement of the nominations on Feb. 12.
Now that the five finalists have been announced, he's on another
international tour to help lock in the final vote. Jackson has flown
to Los Angeles from his native New Zealand, where he is
simultaneously editing the second part of the series due at Christmas
and putting the finishing touches on the 31/2-hour expanded DVD
version of the first film that will be released later this year.</LD>
<TE>   He is meeting with the press and "putting a face to a name" with
academy voters at special screenings of the movie for such
industry-affiliated organizations as the Simon Wiesenthal Center and
Women in Film. Producer Saul Zaentz, who made the animated "Lord of
the Rings" back in the 1970s, has hosted private screenings of
Jackson's movie in L.A. and San Francisco, introducing the director
to select movers and shakers. Like fellow nominee Ron Howard ("A
Beautiful Mind") he's visited the Motion Picture and Television home
in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Then he was off to New York (where the second-largest
concentration of academy voters resides) for more interviews and to
London for the British film awards presentation. (The film ended up
winning best picture and director awards.)</TE>
<TE>   The spate of personal appearances are not only to bolster "Rings'"
chances against the other Oscar favorite, "A Beautiful Mind," for
best picture, but for Jackson himself, in what is considered an even
more hotly contested race for best director. It's the second year
running in which the category has been up for grabs. Jackson's
handicap is that he's up against a battery of veterans--Howard,
Robert Altman ("Gosford Park"), Ridley Scott ("Black Hawk Down") and
David Lynch ("Mulholland Drive")--all of whom are better known in
Hollywood, have significant bodies of work and have never won a
directing Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than lock-step the vote with best picture, Jackson
suggests, academy members this year may be looking at the best
director category as "another way of honoring a particular film."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of that, the studios are courting voters for the best
director category with the same fervor as the usually more
high-profile acting categories. Another reason, according to Michael
Barker, a partner in Sony Pictures Classics, which lobbied for Ang
Lee last year on "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," is that "in a year
that people are referring to as weak, five incredible directors have
been nominated."</TE>
<TE>   Along with Howard and Altman, Jackson is thought to have a good
shot of copping the prize (it's virtually unprecedented for a
director to win without his film also having been nominated, and
neither "Black Hawk" nor "Mulholland" is in the running for best
picture). Lynch will not be doing any stumping for his movie and has
even requested that no trade ads be taken out on his behalf,
according to a Universal Focus spokeswoman. Scott, who has been a
bridesmaid before, says, "I'm crossing my fingers and hoping for the
best," but also plans to keep a relatively low profile during the
voting period.</TE>
<TE>   The other three nominees, however, are out and about, in part
because their films are still in wide release, and in the case of
"Mind" and "Gosford," about to open internationally. Howard has been
touring overseas with the film for the past month. So has Altman, who
is being demonized by conservative commentators like Oliver North
because of some politically incorrect remarks he made to English
journalists about U.S. foreign policy and his admission that he
smokes marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   It's just one reminder of how visible the best director race is
this year. Another is the omission of "Moulin Rouge's" Baz Luhrmann
among the final five nominees. In the months before the announcement
of the Oscar nominations, Luhrmann campaigned heavily for his lavish
musical. His efforts paid off when "Moulin Rouge" won the Golden
Globe for best musical or comedy and reaped eight Oscar nominations,
including best picture. (Luhrmann also received a Directors Guild of
America nomination.)</TE>
<TE>   The extent of his efforts, however, may have backfired with the
directors' branch, leaving him among the missing in the category.
Campaigning for an Oscar by a director is a requirement these days,
but too much campaigning may be counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be that the best director award went hand in hand with
best picture honors, the auteurist logic being that the best movie is
also the best directed film. That kind of thinking, however, no
longer holds.</TE>
<TE>   Last year "Gladiator" was considered the odds-on favorite for best
picture, but the best director race came down to  Lee ("Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon") and Steven Soderbergh (nominated for "Erin
Brockovich" and "Traffic"). "Gladiator's" Scott was considered a
longshot.</TE>
<TE>   The best director race was a nail biter to the very moment the
envelope was opened. "In our case Steven was not only competing with
Ang but with himself," says Russell Schwartz, who at the time ran USA
Films, which released "Traffic" (he is now co-marketing head at New
Line Cinema, which released "Lord of the Rings"). "Our biggest effort
was to convince the academy that it would be a disservice if he lost
because he was up for two movies."</TE>
<TE>   When Lee won the DGA award, another usually accurate bellwether of
the Oscars, it was assumed Soderbergh (also a double nominee for the
DGA) would split his vote at the Oscars as well. But he pulled an
upset and won for "Traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz theorizes that Soderbergh pulled it out during the
campaigning by subtly conveying his pride of ownership on "Traffic"
(which he also photographed) without distancing himself from
"Brockovich." (This year two DGA nominees, Luhrmann and Christopher
Nolan of "Memento," aren't up for the Oscar; Altman and Lynch aren't
nominated for the DGA award).</TE>
<TE>   "Brockovich" producer Michael Shamberg says last year's Oscar
results indicated that voters have become much more discerning in the
selection process. "They are filling out their ballots more carefully
and giving greater thought to each category."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the director's race has become as competitive as
the acting categories in which the winner isn't necessarily in the
most nominated film--for example, Hilary Swank winning best actress
for the 1999 film "Boys Don't Cry."</TE>
<TE>   Making the selection particularly daunting this year, notes
nominee Scott, is that all the nominated directors are represented by
films "that couldn't be more disparate." "Rings" is a large-scale
epic, "Gosford" a single-location ensemble piece, "Mind" an intimate
romantic drama, "Black Hawk" a documentary-style battle film and
"Mulholland" a dark, idiosyncratic mystery.</TE>
<TE>   As is often true in the acting categories, that could call voters'
personal emotions into play, Scott suggests.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, sentiment often surfaces in the best supporting
actor category in which veteran performers are often selected as much
for the particular film as for their body of work (examples include
James Coburn, who won for "Affliction," and Jack Palance, who was
cited for "City Slickers").</TE>
<TE>   That could influence the vote for four of this year's directing
nominees, Jackson being the only relative newcomer. The 77-year-old
Altman would be the most likely candidate for lifetime achievement
recognition, having garnered the most nominations (five) without a
win. "Gosford" is his most commercially successful movie since "MASH"
in 1970, the surprise hit that brought the former TV director to
prominence. Altman has already won the Golden Globe and several
critics' awards for best director.</TE>
<TE>   Howard, who has never been nominated before (despite winning the
DGA award for "Apollo 13"), is extremely popular in Hollywood,
besides being one of the industry's most reliably commercial
directors. Both Scott and Lynch have three nominations, and the
former lost last year even though his "Gladiator" won best picture.</TE>
<TE>   As of now, no one seems to be breaking away from the pack, and
Twentieth Century Fox studio co-chief Tom Rothman is ruling out none
of the five directing nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be favorites, but there could well be an upset," he
says. "It's going to be a lot of fun, with a lot of surprises on
Oscar night."</TE>
<TE>   The only downside, he says, is that "Oscar pools are going to be
very hard to win this year."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ron Howard, "A Beautiful Mind"</LD>
<LD>   Oscar history: Howard's never been nominated before, even though
his "Apollo 13" was in the running for best picture and he won the
Directors Guild of America award for directing it.</LD>
<LD>   In his favor: Howard is extremely well-liked and successful. He's
provided employment and profits for many academy voters in a wide
variety of commercially viable movies.</LD>
<TE>   Working against him: If "Beautiful Mind" wins for best picture,
voters might decide to honor another director to spread the wealth
around.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Altman, "Gosford Park"</TE>
<TE>   Oscar history: Five nominations, the other four being for the
classic movies "MASH," "Nashville," "The Player" and "Short Cuts."</TE>
<TE>   In his favor: An Oscar for Altman, 77, would be tantamount to a
lifetime achievement award.</TE>
<TE>   Working against him: Altman is, and always has been, outspoken and
critical of the Hollywood establishment, which has earned him as many
enemies as admirers.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Jackson, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"</TE>
<TE>   Oscar history: The New Zealand native's first time at bat.</TE>
<TE>   In his favor: "Lord of the Rings" has been Jackson's personal
passion for the past decade. The scope of the achievement--and its
worldwide box-office success--is every director's dream come true.</TE>
<TE>   Working against him: He has two-thirds of the "Rings" trilogy yet
to come. Voters may take a wait-and-see attitude before honoring him.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley Scott, "Black Hawk Down"</TE>
<TE>   Oscar history: Two previous nominations, "Thelma &amp; Louise" and
last year's "Gladiator."</TE>
<TE>   In his favor: He was overlooked last year for reviving a long-dead
genre (the sword-and-sandal epic). Honoring him for the even more
stylistically challenging "Black Hawk" could be a way of recognizing
him for both achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Working against him: "Black Hawk" didn't get a best picture
nomination, and its graphic footage and documentary style might make
it difficult for some voters to warm up to.</TE>
<TE>   David Lynch, "Mulholland Drive"</TE>
<TE>   Oscar history: Two prior nominations, for the groundbreaking "Blue
Velvet" and the memorable "The Elephant Man."</TE>
<TE>   In his favor: Lynch has managed to work within the system while
making films that are daring both in content and style.</TE>
<TE>   Working against him: While critics were over the moon for
"Mulholland" (the film won numerous critics groups' awards), its
roots as a failed TV pilot could work against Lynch with academy
voters, as could its out-there sensibility.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"This is for my satisfaction, but I hope you enjoy it, too," said
India.Arie during the mini solo acoustic set that opened her House of
Blues performance Monday. The segment featured several new tunes not
on her Grammy-nominated debut album, "Acoustic Soul," and she said
that one joyful love song, "Beautiful Surprise," had never before
been played for anyone but friends.</LD>
<LD>   It was a confident move that underscored both the "singer" and the
"songwriter" aspects of this fast-rising newcomer, whose music blends
unsinkable positivity in pensive-to-upbeat numbers with carefully
textured mixtures of R&amp;B, folk, hip-hop and jazz.</LD>
<LD>   And it showed how well she is handling the inevitable expectations
that come with seven nominations in tonight's Grammys--more than
anyone but veterans U2, who have eight--including best new artist,
best album and best R&amp;B album for "Acoustic Soul" and four for her
hit "Video," including best record and song.</LD>
<TE>   Yet Arie, 26, was unguarded enough to charm the room when she
hesitated before playing "Beautiful Surprise," saying, "It's so new,
I'm scared."</TE>
<TE>   But it proved to be a lovely, spiritual-romantic ode to the right
love that reflected her belief in possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The also-fresh "India's Song" captured another facet of Arie's
interests, wending its way through historical musings on racism to
arrive at her own ruminations about making a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Spirit knows no color," she sang. Indeed, although the tunes
played by Arie and her deft sextet often touched on African American
concerns, the lyrics emphasized universal themes of self-acceptance,
honesty, sacrifice and, of course, sweet love.</TE>
<TE>   Name-checking her influences in song, she seemed so mindful of
history that it might have weighed her down. On the contrary: After
the self-possessed artist giddily announced that veteran
singer-songwriter Bill Withers was in the house, for instance, she
then wove his "Just the Two of Us" around her own "Promises," even
bringing her mom out for a quick bit of vocalizing.</TE>
<TE>   Among Arie's many impressive qualities, however, her determined
self-expression was the most compelling. It may sound simple to say
things such as "love yourself," but these days we just don't hear it
enough from people who mean it. Besides, she's found fresh ways of
saying old stuff, and isn't that what we're all looking for?</TE>

<LD>From the days of cave drawing, the simple-minded male has been a
staple of storytelling.</LD>
<LD>   Often, this creature is boorishly entertaining, like Jackie
Gleason as Ralph Kramden in "The Honeymooners" or Carroll O'Connor as
Archie Bunker in "All in the Family." Even Jim Belushi was a hoot as
Rob Lowe's blustery pal, Bernie, in "About Last Night ... ," the 1986
romantic comedy movie.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, Belushi's latest Annoying Man incarnation, the
title character on the sitcom "According to Jim," is more likely to
make viewers wince than laugh with his crude quips. For this kind of
humor to work, the writing needs to be sharper than the protagonist.</LD>
<TE>   In tonight's episode (8:30, ABC), Jim tells his much better half,
Cheryl (Courtney Thorne-Smith), that he let her win a racquetball
match years ago as part of his sly courtship strategy. When an irate
Cheryl demands a rematch, the rules get trampled in the ensuing
battle of the sexes.</TE>
<TE>   The episode is loaded with the kind of relationship humor done
better on "Everybody Loves Raymond"--and just as blandly in other
prime-time slots and at open mike nights across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Jim and the fellahs make pizza smoothies (don't ask), quaff beer
and gripe about those "feelings talks" that women always seem to be
instigating.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the rare funny moments come whenever Jim's mildly creepy
brother-in-law, Andy (Larry Joe Campbell), offers up one of his non
sequiturs.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody may not love Raymond, sweet as he is, but it's hard to
see how anybody could fall for the retread humor of "According to
Jim."</TE>

<LD>Two nights of women's figure skating and the closing ceremonies
provided a strong finishing kick to NBC's coverage of the Winter
Olympics, nearly tripling the network's audience during the
corresponding week a year ago and beating combined prime-time viewing
of CBS, Fox and ABC by more than 9 million viewers, based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   The Olympics have left NBC--perched in second place before the
Games began--with a commanding lead for the current TV season, which
began in late September and officially concludes in late May.</LD>
<LD>   ABC, meanwhile, comes out of the Winter Games leading Fox--which
benefited from airing the Super Bowl and World Series--by only the
narrowest of margins in total viewership and tied with CBS for third
among adults ages 18 to 49, the key demographic among advertisers.</LD>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, CBS drew modest ratings against the closing
ceremonies with "The Rosa Parks Story," though the movie did take the
silver in its time slot.</TE>
<TE>   More youth-oriented programs generally fared better against the
Games, including Fox's "The Simpsons," which, still durable in its
13th season, ranked behind only "Everybody Loves Raymond" overall
among non-Olympic offerings.</TE>

<HD>Film's Early Blue Period</HD>
<DH>Mark Vieira's lectures and screenings recall 'pre-Code'
Hollywood,  when energetic but raw movies led to Hays Office
crackdowns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON ALON WALZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moments past sundown on a warm Friday evening, Mark Vieira's
Starlight Studio has suddenly become a beehive of activity.</LD>
<LD>   With classic jazz gently playing just below conversation level and
surrounded all around by huge photos by the master photographers of
Hollywood's Golden Age, two of Vieira's assistants scurry up and down
stairs and in and out of a darkroom on the first-floor studio space
of Starlight's historic loft, working to complete sales of freshly
printed photos. A pair of cats has the run of the place.</LD>
<LD>   On a dark green sofa in the middle of the studio, two
thirtysomething photo collectors sift through a paper-handled grocery
bag brimming with vintage negatives, now and then hunching over a
light box to examine their selections. Vieira paces nearby with a
cane, alternately fielding phone calls, sipping a Pepsi and talking
to a reporter.</LD>
<TE>   The two main passions in Vieira's life--vintage Hollywood
photography and the classic studio films of the 1930s--resulted in
two well-regarded books: "Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits," about his
friend and mentor George Hurrell's life and work from 1929 through
1943; and 1999's "Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood," a detailed
tome on the salacious and adult-oriented "pre-Code" films of the
early 1930s. The success of "Sin" prompted Vieira earlier this year
to begin a lecture and screening series of these seldom-seen movies
on 16mm at his Starlight Studio each Tuesday night through May 7.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a guy whose life nearly came to an end near the corner
of Sepulveda and Santa Monica boulevards in Westwood on March 28,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   While the photographer was loading equipment into the trunk of his
car that afternoon, a speeding car "swerved out of the southbound
traffic lane and smashed me into my car," Vieira recalls. "A good
Samaritan stanched the flow of blood after I had lost six units, but
as I lay on the street behind my car, my heart stopped."</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA emergency unit arrived quickly and revived him, but found
his left leg had been crushed beyond repair. It had to be amputated,
thus beginning a five-week stay for Vieira at UCLA Medical Center and
a physical rehabilitation routine that continues. He says, however,
he feels that today, almost two years later--the prosthesis, the cane
and the wheelchair notwithstanding--he is regaining his pre-accident
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like my life, my eyes, hands and one leg were spared so I
could continue the work I am devoting my life to," Vieira says.
"There's not much money in it, frankly, but I really love it."</TE>
<TE>   Around the time of the accident, Vieira had been planning to spin
"Sin in Soft Focus" into a touring screening and lecture series
featuring the films discussed in the book. Finally realized after two
years, his current series highlights more than two dozen Paramount
Pictures films made between 1930 and 1934.</TE>
<TE>   It was a time of aggressive boundary-stretching and taboo-breaking
in American cinema that, for the first time, gave mainstream
audiences frank images of violence, nudity and sexuality, as well as
candid depictions of drug use, prostitution and even religious
blasphemy.</TE>
<TE>   "These films have a rawness and a kind of energy that you've
rarely seen since--the best of them are terrifically entertaining
movies," says film critic and noted pre-Code historian Leonard
Maltin. "Even [in the 1950s] filmmakers still could not do what they
did quite openly and quite boldly in the early '30s movies."</TE>
<TE>   Production Code at</TE>
<TE>   First Was 'Toothless'</TE>
<TE>   "Pre-Code" is generally defined as the span between March 1930,
when the Motion Picture Production Code was adopted (and initially
ignored) by the major studios, and July 1934, when the "Hays Office,"
as the censorship body was nicknamed after the man who ran it until
1945, Will H. Hays, began a more aggressive campaign to not only stop
the production of films that contained what was considered "morally
offensive" content, but also to bowdlerize those made before the
summer of 1934.</TE>
<TE>   "The Code was fundamentally toothless over its first four years,"
Vieira says. When MGM head of production Irving Thalberg optioned the
controversial novel "The Divorcee," the Hays Office instructed the
studio not to make it. MGM made it anyway after Thalberg's wife,
Norma Shearer, lobbied assertively not only to have the film produced
but also to star in it--a campaign that included scheduling a
provocative photo shoot with a talented but little-known 24-year-old
photographer named George Hurrell, recommended to her by Ramon
Novarro, to prove to her husband and the studio she could play a
"bad" girl. Shearer got the role and won an Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Vieira notes that along with "The Divorcee," four key films that
prompted the Hays Office to step up enforcement are "Red-Headed
Woman," with the occasionally clad Jean Harlow; the violent 1932 Paul
Muni vehicle "Scarface"; Cecil B. DeMille's heretical "Sign of the
Cross"; and the notorious "Convention City" with Mary Astor and
Adolphe Menjou, about a married conventioneer's pursuit of sex on a
business trip to Atlantic City. "'Convention City' got the most cuts
of any film in the Code's history, and is completely unwatchable in
its cut form," Vieira says.</TE>
<TE>   Content from hundreds of pre-1934 films was excised methodically
by the Hays Office's zealous L.A. studio liaison Joseph Breen,
beginning in 1934 and continuing well into the mid-'50s, when films
began playing on television. In recent years, lost footage has been
found and reinserted into many of the "cut" films, but there are
close to 100 films still missing footage.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in the Bay Area in the '50s and would watch these films
on local TV stations," Vieira says. "Although I didn't know about the
cuts, something just drew me to the kinds of worlds these films
portrayed, and it fascinated me."</TE>
<TE>   Vieira says he has seen "a great number" of the pre-Code films
either in theaters or on TV since the mid-'50s, but some he will be
seeing for the first time in the current series. "I'm really looking
forward to 'From Hell to Heaven' [April 2] and 'Guilty as Hell'
[April 9], both from director Erle C. Kenton, who made full use of
the early zoom and wide-angle lens technologies during this period.
'Dancers in the Dark' [March 12] is supposedly full of wonderful,
expressionistic lighting and camera work," he says. "I can't wait."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of this series in May, he plans to move it to the
Hollywood History Museum in the Max Factor Building to "share it with
an even wider audience." Continuous with the museum series he plans
to conduct a studio-by-studio tour of the pre-Code films at his
Starlight Studio, beginning with some of the controversial films he
mentioned earlier from the MGM and Fox libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Book Project Looms</TE>
<TE>   in Vieira's Future</TE>
<TE>   With the 51-year-old Vieira's past difficulties behind him, the
promise of the future seems inspiring once again. On the horizon is
the publication a new, large-format book on Hollywood's horror movies
from 1920 through 1968 commissioned by publisher Harry Abrams, for
which he is still researching, writing and collecting prints and
negatives.</TE>
<TE>   As a reporter prepares to leave, the collectors have selected
about three dozen negatives for Vieira to print. One assistant has
already left for the weekend, and the friendly cats are nowhere to be
found.</TE>
<TE>   "Although I'm much more jaundiced toward materialism and grabbing
things, I did have a feeling when my heart stopped on the sidewalk
that all these things here in my studio were not going to be
appreciated and enjoyed by anyone again," Vieira says, gesturing to
the row of film cans on the floor below the Hurrells, his photo
equipment and other rare accouterments of a Hollywood era long past.
"That is why I am doubly eager to share all this knowledge I've
accumulated."</TE>

<HD>Rands' Seamless 'Songs of the Sun'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From an outward description, Bertrand Rands' "Canti del Sole" (Songs
of the Sun) might seem to risk bowing under the weight of its
ambition. The British composer's work is part of a trilogy of
multilingual settings written over the course of 13 years, on the
various cosmic themes of moon, sun and eclipse. For "Songs of the
Sun," which won the 1984 Pulitzer Prize, he drew on 14 different
texts from four languages, including the work of D.H. Lawrence,
Baudelaire and Rimbaud.</LD>
<LD>   But however monumental its design, as heard on Monday night at
Zipper Hall on the Green Umbrella series, the work proceeded
seamlessly, and in a taut, Postmodern musical language that
challenged as it soothed.</LD>
<LD>   Rands' moving song cycle was the centerpiece of a concert by the
Thornton Contemporary Music Ensemble, from the music school at USC,
directed by Donald Crockett. It was also the final event of a
USC-sponsored series featuring Rands as artist-in-residence.</LD>
<TE>   Tenor Jonathan Mack gave an impressively persuasive and
necessarily flexible reading of the Rands work, backed ably by the
10-piece ensemble. Mack, handy with the abrupt shift of languages,
strained expressively upward on Dylan Thomas' "I turn the corner of
prayer and burn," and dovetailed into a wistful conclusion on
Quasimodo's "And in no time it's evening." He exhaled the final,
title line like a double-edged commentary on the waning of sunlight
and time.</TE>
<TE>   New music concerts should disarm expectations and twist ears, and
this one did. The first half featured the startling sound of another
Thornton/USC group, the Schoenfeld Cello Ensemble. Eight cellos
navigated two West Coast premieres, intriguing in different ways.
Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho's beautiful yet unsentimental
"Neiges" celebrated and poeticized textural effects for the cello
swarm, while American composer August Read Thomas' evocative
"Blizzard in Paradise" treated the ensemble like one big, cohesive
mega-cello.</TE>
<TE>   Percussionist Lynn Vartan gave a bold performance of Kevin Volans'
striking solo work "She Who Sleeps With a Small Blanket," an
energetic romp for dark-toned drums. It's all about heady bustling,
but with an almost hymn-like melodic tag on bass marimba.</TE>

<LD>Weekend in the mountains, a father's story:</LD>
<LD>   We're headed to this little hill in the eastern Sierra, L.A.'s
sprawling backyard. We stop in Bishop for Chinese food and gas.
Later, we fill up the car.</LD>
<LD>   "Dad, I've got gas," the boy says.</LD>
<TE>   "No kidding," I say.</TE>
<TE>   It's cold, but it's a dry cold. It's 30 but feels 40. I'm 40 but
feel 30.</TE>
<TE>   I ride the last 100 miles on a soft wallet, spongy with vacation
cash. The night is clear. A million stars fill the sky. Heaven's
nightlights.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere up here, there's a ski resort. Mammoth Mountain, they
call it. Mount Wobegon.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a little girl's story:</TE>
<TE>   Dad keeps telling us to look at the stars.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids, look at all those stars," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Great stars, Dad," we say.</TE>
<TE>   I can't wait to get to Mammoth. All my friends are going. My dad
says it's going to be too many people and everyone will run over his
nice rental skis.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what skiing is all about," my mom says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, chill, Dad," my brother says.</TE>
<TE>   My mom makes me drink lots of water on account of she thinks it'll
stop altitude sickness. So I drink, like, 4 gallons of water on the
way up, then have to go bathroom. A lot.</TE>
<TE>   "Good idea on the water, honey," my dad says.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at all those stars," says my mom.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a boy's story:</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth is the best. It's sort of like Disneyland, except there's
a lot more people.</TE>
<TE>   At Mammoth, they have all these trails, and you can get away from
the skiers anytime you want. I hate skiers. My dad's a skier, and I
don't hate him, but I hate all the other skiers. They act like they
own the mountain or something.</TE>
<TE>   If I could do one thing forever, it would be snowboard. I love to
snowboard, especially at Mammoth.</TE>
<TE>   My dad says that, from his experience, snowboarders are evil
people who never bathe or brush their teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, snowboarding is the sport of kings," I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   "Dirty kings," he says, "who never brush their teeth."</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a mother's story:</TE>
<TE>   I spent three days packing. Mittens, scarves, hats. I'm running
around like a rabbit, and all he does is watch the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting psyched for snow," my husband says.</TE>
<TE>   "How about getting packed for snow," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather get psyched," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Just before we leave, he packs three T-shirts, a sweater and a
pair of jeans. Then I add the clothes he really needs.</TE>
<TE>   And five bottles of Trader Joe's wine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a father's story:</TE>
<TE>   It takes a ski village to raise a child.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm standing near Chair 16, surrounded by a dozen children, all
of whom look the same in their snow hats and goggles.</TE>
<TE>   One mother is off searching for her 10-year-old son. At least two
other kids in our group have been missing for an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Sean," a kid tells me.</TE>
<TE>   "Where?"</TE>
<TE>   "On the back of a snowmobile," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Great. We are up here with seven families with a total of 39 kids.
In only the first day, I have lost eight parents and at least four of
the kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's have lunch," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" say the kids.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Lodge is the Ellis Island of lunch. Every table is taken,
by shivering masses, wondering how they got here and if they'll ever,
ever see home again.</TE>
<TE>   "Where should we sit?" the little girl asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Acapulco," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the athletic challenges I will face this ski weekend,
nothing will match carrying a $40 tray of food through jampacked
Canyon Lodge while wearing ski boots and four layers of clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "Over here, Dad," the little girl yells, and 30 dads turn around.</TE>
<TE>   When we finally find a table, the kids eat three bites of their $8
burgers. You could feed Argentina with what they leave on their
plates.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Argentina would eat it, necessarily. Cheesy to a fault,
ski resort food coagulates even before it enters your bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great," the little girl says, chomping on a chili fry.</TE>
<TE>   "The best," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a little girl's story:</TE>
<TE>   You should've seen my dad putting on the tire chains in that
blizzard we had. First, he lays the chains in the snow and tries to
read the directions. Then he crumples up the directions and throws
them in the car.</TE>
<TE>   "Stupid directions," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Then he comes back into the condo and tells my mom that installing
chains is like putting braces on your own teeth, with ski mittens on.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do it, honey," says my mom, who's always saying things
like that.</TE>
<TE>   Then his friend Will goes to help him with the chains. Like, two
hours later, they come marching in, all done with the chains.</TE>
<TE>   "Piece of cake," Will says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, cake," says my dad.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a father's story:</TE>
<TE>   I am sore in places I cannot touch. I am sore in other people's
places. I am sore in future lives.</TE>
<TE>   My wallet is empty, and my knee hurts as if filled with buckshot.</TE>
<TE>   Last night at dinner, I paid 22 bucks for a $12 piece of fish.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there's a hot tub.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a boy's story:</TE>
<TE>   One time at Mammoth, I got my head stuck in the gondola.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a mother's story:</TE>
<TE>   It's really fun up here. The kids, the parents, the lost ski
boots. I just looked outside. It's snowing sideways.</TE>
<TE>   If we run out of wine, we are doomed. Seriously, irrevocably
doomed.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend in the mountains, a father's story:</TE>
<TE>   Anybody seen the corkscrew?</TE>

<HD>Some Athletes Just a Click Away From Being 'Discovered'</HD>
<DH>Sports: * Hoping to be recruited by colleges, teen players
advertise their athletic (and academic) prowess on the Internet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As his skills developed, Josiah Brand seemed a cinch to play college
baseball. Moving through the ranks, from Little League to elite
traveling teams, he emerged as someone to keep an eye on, a comer.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the 18-year-old is the starting second baseman at
Fallbrook High School in northern San Diego County. Last year, as a
junior, he batted .372. He's no slouch in the classroom either,
sporting a 3.85 grade point average. But his father, Jeff Brand, was
leaving nothing to chance when it came to college. He cruised the
Internet, investigating the multitude of online services that could
promote his son's talents. He settled on College Prospects of
America, forking over $1,000 so that Josiah's stats--both athletic
and academic--could be examined by any coach who cared to have a
look.</LD>
<LD>   Soon after Josiah's Web page went up, complete with a
recommendation from a pro scout who is a family acquaintance, what
Jeff Brand described as a "small tsunami of interest" came their way.
About 40 schools made contact, including a number in the Midwest and
East that don't have the budgets to recruit in Southern California.
So was it worth it?</LD>
<TE>   "After all the money we've spent on hitting coaches and speed
training and even things like eye training, I think it's a very
comfortable thousand bucks to spend," said Brand, a general
contractor.</TE>
<TE>   He is not alone. Thousands of parents, eager to see their children
continue their athletic careers at the collegiate level--and reap the
scholarships that come with it--are signing up with recruiting
agencies that promise national exposure for a price.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, Marsalis Paige, a talented 17-year-old split
end from Marion, Ark. His father, Mike Paige, felt that his son's
achievements during his senior season last year hadn't received
enough notice. So there is Marsalis on the FootballProspects.com Web
site, complete with a stylish picture, his grade point average and
the fact that he averaged 23.7 yards per catch last season. "If it
wasn't for the Web site, we might have been lost," said Mike Paige.
"You've got to promote your kid."</TE>
<TE>   While there are recruiting sites that also promote academic
scholarship and the arts, the majority have athletics as their main
focus. The Baseball Coaches of America Web site, for instance, lists
45 recruiting agencies that can be reached by scouts with a click of
a mouse. All of them are places where coaches can at least have a
first look at players who want to play at the collegiate level.</TE>
<TE>   The Web sites offer varying services at wildly varying prices.
Some simply offer exposure far beyond the players' local colleges and
universities. Others tout professionally edited game films, slick
brochures and the promise of college placement. Some even give the
athletes detailed information about who has perused their stats.</TE>
<TE>   To sign on, young athletes, purchase space on the Internet site of
their choice, where they then list their qualifications and perhaps
add a picture and the recommendation of a coach. Then they wait to
see if they'll be noticed. For higher fees, the recruiting service
will be more proactive, adding more services to the package, such as
follow-up calls to coaches.</TE>
<TE>   There are no figures available on how many colleges make use of
these services. But to  hear the recruiting people tell it, the
Internet has eliminated the days when a gifted athlete could not be
matched with a college program somewhere--though that somewhere may
be a long way from home. As Mike Petersen, head of the Colorado-based
National Athletic Scholarship Registry, put it: "It might mean that
Johnny has to go to South Dakota to play baseball, but at least he'll
get to play at the next level."</TE>
<TE>   One of the oldest such services is the College Athletic Placement
Service, headquartered in the San Diego suburb of Rancho Bernardo.
Director Bill Serra began the business in 1971, working mostly with
athletes in New Jersey, where he then lived.  He said the Internet
has made a dramatic difference in how his company now does business.
"It's changed things a thousand percent," he said, recalling the days
when he sent out thousands of brochures each year to attract
athletes. "Now we don't have a brochure. There's no brochure that's
going to tell anything better than what can be found on the Web
site."</TE>
<TE>   And coaches are paying attention, though not necessarily ones from
the top-tiered schools with big budgets, recruiting staffs and
far-reaching alumni networks. Most of those have homed in on the blue
chippers they want long before the athletes have reached their senior
year in high school.</TE>
<TE>   But for coaches at smaller schools the services can make a
difference. Bobby Elder took over as baseball coach at Wheaton
College, just outside Chicago, six months ago. He immediately found
himself in crisis mode, having to scramble to fill his roster.
Because he didn't yet have a recruiting network in place, and because
the school's academic standards are high, Elder searched the Internet
and found several qualified players.</TE>
<TE>   "It allowed us to make contact with as many kids as possible even
though it was so late in the game," he said. "And it allowed us to
screen a lot of kids pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Or take Jim Cappello, the women's soccer coach at tiny Warner
Southern College, a Christian school located in central Florida. He
took over the soccer program three years ago and realized that he too
had a recruiting problem. He combed the Internet for prospects,
sending out hundreds of e-mails to students who had subscribed to
various recruiting services. This year, six of Cappello's 34 players
were found via the Internet. His team went from 0-18 the first year
to a 10-9-1 record the second, good enough to make the league
semifinals. "Some of the higher-end players from outside the state
were basically recruited by e-mails," said Cappello. "I was able to
give recruits the e-mail addresses of current players so they could
tell them what it's like to live at the school. To me, that was the
most important recruiting tool."</TE>
<TE>   The costs of online recruiting services range from less than $100
to more than $2,000.  But Tracy Jackson of College Prospects of
America, one of the country's largest, said no one is going to get
rich in the business, given the limited amount of top talent and the
need to keep costs affordable. College Prospects charges between $950
and $1,550 per athlete and Jackson said the company works with
"several thousand" students a year. He said roughly 90% of the
students who sign up get "offers to go somewhere," though it might
not be a college the athlete wants to attend.</TE>
<TE>   At Football Prospects, owner Bryan Shumock charges a one-time fee
of $99, which gets a player's picture and statistics on his site and
includes him in printed directories that go to 500 football programs
around the country. Extra services--such as more prominent display in
the directory--up the price to about $250. But Shumock, a pilot for
American Airlines, says his one-person venture doesn't earn enough
for him to quit flying. He said he'd been more successful than others
because of his bare-bones approach to the service, which he runs out
of his Bethlehem, Pa., home. "What gets a lot of people [running
recruiting services] in trouble is that they try to do too much," he
said. "This kind of business can't pay for 20 salaries and a big
office."</TE>
<TE>   The fee Shumock charged seemed like money well spent to Jesse
Jones, a 297-pound, 18-year-old high school lineman from York, Pa. He
said he learned almost immediately that his aspirations of playing
for a big-time program were unrealistic. "You come to a realization
after going through this process that you have to be really big and a
top student athlete," he said. But that doesn't mean he won't be
playing college ball. He can reel off a number of smaller schools
that have expressed interest in him since Football Prospects posted
him on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiters caution that one of the common mistakes parents make is
overestimating the athletic skills of their children, then spending
thousands in the hopeless pursuit of a college scholarship. The sites
are littered with athletic resumes that would underwhelm most college
recruiters.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, of College Prospects, said that after 16 years in the
recruiting business, his rule of thumb is that only one in 10 high
school athletes has the ability to play in college. He said his
organization won't even take an athlete unless they are recommended
by both the prospect's high school coach and one of his company's own
evaluators.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side of the coin, he said, are the athletes who could
play in college but won't because they don't know how to market
themselves. That, he and others said, is largely the fault of parents
who think recruiters are supposed to arrive at their doorsteps with
college offers. "Most parents just sit and sit, and when their son or
daughter doesn't get a bite, they shrug their shoulders and say it's
too bad but their children's athletic careers are over," said
Petersen of the national sports registry.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Internet can be of benefit both in identifying and
weeding out candidates, coaches overwhelmingly believe that they must
see the potential athletes in person, to get--as one coach put
it--"into the kid's insides."</TE>
<TE>   "I think most college coaches would agree that the best way to
evaluate talent is to go out and watch it," said Mark O'Brien, the
head baseball coach at the private, Jesuit-run Santa Clara
University. "However, you can find out a tremendous amount of
information about a prospective athlete on the Internet. We look at
it all the time."</TE>
<TE>   As for Jesse Jones and Marsalis Paige, both will attend colleges
that discovered them on the Internet and both will have substantial
aid packages. Jesse will attend Kentucky State University in
Frankfort, Ky., and Marsalis will play college ball at Fairfield
University in Fairfield, Conn. And Josiah Brand, despite the interest
expressed by so many colleges and universities, chose one that did
not recruit him.</TE>
<TE>   Josiah discovered the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania, one of the country's top business schools. Because of
his interest in the subject, he called the Penn baseball coach and
asked about playing for him. He was accepted and awarded a hefty
financial aid package soon thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Josiah's high school baseball coach, Jay Craven, said being
contacted by so many schools made Josiah realize what might be
possible. "Penn is a perfect place for Joe," he said. "Baseball will
be a part of the overall process for him."</TE>

<HD>A Dark Reflection</HD>
<DH>An accusing glare is often cast on parents of those who
have outraged the public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If they're lucky, it starts with flowers, a sympathetic letter or a
neighbor's embrace. But more often than not, it begins--and never
seems to end--with a torrent of hard stares, menacing phone calls,
hate mail and death threats.</LD>
<LD>   They are the parents of children gone bad--children who are
violent criminals or so outrage the national conscience that they
become pariahs.Even when parents are legally blameless, they are
often damned--by the public, by pundits, by talk show hosts.</LD>
<LD>   The latest set of parents to feel the sting of blame are those of
John Walker Lindh. Though the American Taliban has not been charged
with killing anyone and has pleaded not guilty to charges he took up
arms against his country, he has been reviled as much as some
murderers.</LD>
<TE>   What parent could possibly be prepared when a child is suddenly
thrust into the headlines in the most negative way? Not only must
they grapple with their own horror or anguish, they must do so under
the hot lights of the national media. The costs can be enormous. The
tab for a legal defense in such cases can run into the hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of dollars. Friendships vanish overnight,
ties with relatives are severed and marriages shatter.</TE>
<TE>   Grief, guilt and a relentless second-guessing ensue. "Why didn't I
catch this?" "What did I do wrong?" "How could this happen?" It can
crystallize into an often overwhelming depression.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since Sigmund Freud, we've been blaming Mommy and Daddy,"
said Jack Levin, a Northeastern University professor who has written
extensively about murderers and their families. "People want the
inexplicable explained. People want to make sense of the senseless.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to excuse the parents because in many cases they
do have something to do with the event," added Levin, a sociologist.
"But the public often makes this leap before the evidence is in and
that's when it can really damage the parents who are already
suffering enormously."</TE>
<TE>   Parents of notorious children rarely talk publicly. E-mail or
phone calls to more than a dozen such parents, including those of
Lindh, Jeffrey Dahmer and students who have shot classmates, were not
returned. Such reluctance is not surprising, report psychologists and
sociologists who have worked with the families. Parents battle
enormous shame, and retelling the details to the public through the
media is simply too painful for most. There can be compelling legal
restraints as well.</TE>
<TE>   The parents of Dylan Klebold, who was one of the two teens to
shoot 13 classmates at Columbine High School in Colorado, are "facing
a number of pending lawsuits totaling $300 million and have been
advised not to say a word," said James Garbarino, author of "Parents
Under Siege" (Free Press, 2001). Garbarino was the only person
outside of law enforcement to interview the Klebolds. Polls clearly
reveal the propensity to blame the parents for the sins of the child.
A Gallup Poll taken shortly after the 1999 Columbine rampage showed
that 84% of respondents faulted parents, at least in part, for the
tragedy. Meanwhile, a CBS News poll at the time found 40% believed
that the parents were not only to blame, but were the chief reason
for the shootings. (The next highest rated culprit was television
violence at 8%.)</TE>
<TE>   The public has it about right. In about four out of five cases,
experts believe emotional, physical or sexual abuse at the hands of
at least one parent plays a central role in a child's horribly
aberrant behavior. In the other one in five cases, however, parents
provided reasonably stable, warm households and, still, their
children went wrong. Any number of reasons may account for this
including chemical imbalances in the child's brain, early head
trauma, exposure to media violence and peer influence, said
Garbarino, a professor of human development at Cornell University and
co-director of the Family Life Development Center.</TE>
<TE>   "The Klebolds didn't abuse or neglect their kid. They were
involved and loving," said Garbarino, who dedicated his book to them.
"But it raises the question of why bad things happen to good
parents?"</TE>
<TE>   It seems the public is often so quick to blame the parents, it
forgets the ultimate responsibility rests on the perpetrator. "We
want to place responsibility everywhere else it seems except the
killer," Levin said. "I remember people were blaming the neighbor of
[mass murderer John Wayne] Gacy for not noticing the smell," after
more than 30 bodies were discovered buried in his basement.</TE>
<TE>   With that mind-set, besieged parents can be astonished even by the
simplest gestures of support.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Martinez, mother of Michael McDermott, a mentally ill
veteran who gunned down seven people at his workplace near Boston in
2000, reported she was in tears after receiving letters, flowers and
hugs from neighbors. Even Lionel Dahmer, father of notorious serial
killer Jeffrey, found empathy on his first day back to work after his
son's 1991 arrest. A co-worker said, "There but for the grace of God
go I, Lionel," according to the elder Dahmer's book, "A Father's
Story" (William Morrow, 1994).</TE>
<TE>   But tenderness is far from the norm. More plentiful, particularly
in the case of the Dahmers and the Klebolds, are harassing phone
calls late at night, angry letters, threats against their homes and
even their lives. All of which can lead to a need for police
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The frenzied climate after the capture of a particularly infamous
criminal almost always generates a whirlpool of rumors and lies about
the parents. Frances Bianchi, the mother of one of the two Hillside
Stranglers, Kenneth Bianchi, was accused by her son of holding his
hand over a flame and exposing him to pornographic material when he
was 12. Both assertions proved false. And a mystery guest on a talk
show hosted by Geraldo Rivera claimed that Lionel Dahmer had sexually
molested his son, which also was found to be untrue. Yet, the damage
was done.</TE>
<TE>   "Looks and glances that were probably entirely innocent, now
looked sinister to me, questioning and accusatory," wrote Dahmer in
his book. "A kind of paranoia gripped me. I wondered how people could
believe such a terrible thing about me, if they believed it. And that
was part of my confusion, that I absolutely could not be sure what
anyone thought of me anymore."</TE>
<TE>   At precisely the time they need human warmth and contact the most,
the isolation these parents experience can be at its greatest. "The
Klebolds had the dual thing of losing their kid's life and then
dealing with the immensity of what their child had done," said
Garbarino, who frequently is called as an expert courtroom witness in
family relationships. "When your child dies in a suicide/homicide,
your ability to grieve and get social support gets severely
compromised."</TE>
<TE>   The lives of many such parents simply collapse under the weight of
suspicion and shame. The fate of Frances Bianchi is not uncommon,
said Levin, who has interviewed dozens of family members of
murderers. Before adopting her son from an alcoholic prostitute when
he was 3 months old, Bianchi was the picture of a contented,
middle-class homemaker in Rochester, N.Y., according to Levin.</TE>
<TE>   Within a short time after her son's arrest for killing more than a
half-dozen young women, her friends and relatives deserted her and
her longtime marriage abruptly ended. Today, she lives under another
name in a trailer park on the West Coast, Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   "Her entire life fell apart," said Levin, who talked with Bianchi
for six hours, during most of which, she cried.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Flint, Jeffrey Dahmer's mother, also struggled mightily with
her parental legacy. She and her husband divorced in the late 1970s
and she later moved to Fresno in the late 1980s--years before her
son's crimes came to light. In Fresno, she managed a retirement
residence and later became a case manager for the Central Valley AIDS
Team. Three years after her son's arrest, she tried to commit
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   One of Dahmer's lawyers, Gerald Boyle, said his client told him
repeatedly that Flint was a great mother. "It was clear she bore no
responsibility ... [but] she had to live with the idea that she was
the mother of a monster, and it drove her crazy," Boyle said. Flint
died of breast cancer in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Dahmer's younger brother, David, also left Ohio,
legally changed his name and has steadfastly refused all media
requests for interviews. Yet Lionel Dahmer remains in Ohio, clinging
to his old life, refusing even to get an unlisted phone number.</TE>
<TE>   As gruesome as the Dahmer case was and as shocking as school
shootings have been, Lindh may well be more reviled than any
murderer. His acts have struck at something greater than the
individual, at America itself, generating widespread outrage.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, a child of wealth and privilege, is seen as having betrayed
his nation when it was under lethal attack. A grand jury indicted him
on 10 counts, including one on conspiracy to kill Americans overseas.
And despite the fact he doesn't face the death penalty, there are
regular calls for his death, most recently by the family of the CIA
officer killed in the Afghan prison where Lindh was captured.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's parents, who are divorced, also have been largely
excoriated in the opinion press. They are routinely denounced for
failing to set limits for their son.  "When someone is accused of
[being a traitor], the parents are seen as responsible. In the minds
of many, the parents of John Walker Lindh are as treasonous as their
son," Levin said. The parents' courthouse protestations that their
son "loves America" and "has done nothing wrong" have failed to win
much sympathy for their son or themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents are expected to defend their children," said Murray
Strauss, an author and parenting expert at the University of New
Hampshire. "But there has to be a recognition that their child has
done something wrong and in the case of the Taliban fighter I don't
think the parents' claims have gone over very well."</TE>
<TE>   A better example, perhaps, of supporting the child while still
acknowledging wrongdoing, were the parents of David Attias, the
college student accused of running down and killing four people and
critically injuring another on a street near the UC Santa Barbara
campus last year.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief statement at his son's first courthouse appearance,
Hollywood TV and film director Daniel Attias said: "On behalf of my
wife, I'd like to say how devastated and heartbroken we are for
everyone affected by this horrible event. We know this has not
affected just the loved ones and families of victims who must be
feeling unspeakable grief."</TE>
<TE>   As the parents of victims know, apologies have to be done with a
great deal of sensitivity and care. Otherwise, they only reopen a
painful wound. In many cases, the parents of a murder victim don't
even want to see, much less hear from, the parents of the killer,
said Nancy Ruhe-Munch, executive director of the National
Organization of Murdered Children Inc. She estimates that
parent-to-parent apologies occur in about three out of 100 murder
cases. Despite the low number, Ruhe-Munch still feels parents whose
children commit egregious acts deserve a break.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents of murderers don't have any place to turn because
nobody wants to hear about their pain," she said. "People don't
usually stop to think they hated what their child did, too. Jeffrey
Dahmer's parents are in pain too."</TE>

<LD>When Grammy nominee Joshua Bell fell in love last fall, he had to get
rid of the "old one" before he could pursue the object of his
affection.</LD>
<LD>   "I had feelings of guilt," said 34-year-old violinist. "It was
painful to let go ... but I was smitten by the new one."</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, Bell (who was judged among the most beautiful by
People magazine two years ago) got what he wanted: the red
Stradivarius that he will be bringing to the Grammys tonight.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a kind of chemistry that's hard to describe," he says of his
feelings for the $3.5-million violin, "like love at first sight."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the 289-year-old instrument has had many suitors over
the centuries.</TE>
<TE>   First stolen in 1919, it disappeared again in 1936 Carnegie Hall
in New York. Decades later, a cafe musician made a deathbed
confession that he took the instrument, and had been playing it in
cafes all these years. The instrument was returned to the insurer,
Lloyds of London, which sold it to British violinist Norbert Brainin.
In September, Bell bought the violin from Brainin.</TE>
<TE>   "The relationship between player and instrument is very much like
a marriage," Bell said. "There are times when you're getting along,
and there are other times when you're fighting. There are good days
and bad days."</TE>
<TE>   The instrument is unique--a piece of science and art. Its perfect
shape and varnish make it an acoustic marvel, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The instrument is your voice," Bell said, adding that his violin
equals "a transplant of Caruso's voice."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Bell, who will play for millions during the telecast,
received a Grammy nomination for the album "Bernstein: West Side
Story Suite." (He won a Grammy last year for his recording of the
Nicholas Maw Violin Concerto.)</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his beloved instrument, Bell will take actress
Kristin Chenoweth to the ceremony. "All the money in the world might
not buy me anything like it," he said of the Strad. "It's gorgeous. I
am in awe." Of his girlfriend, he added with a chuckle: "I don't
think she gets jealous."</TE>
<TE>   George's Day</TE>
<TE>   George Harrison fans huddled around a makeshift shrine, a
collection of photos, candles, poems and flowers, at the Beatles'
star on the corner of La Brea and Hollywood boulevards Monday night
in Hollywood. The crowd, mostly graying baby boomers, along with a
John Lennon impersonator doing his best Liverpool accent, had
gathered to remember the musician's 59th birthday. Emcee Jerry Rubin,
a longtime Santa Monica activist best known for his biannual Lennon
memorials, hovered over a giant birthday cake as radio host Chris
Carter sliced it. "Make sure you don't eat the [melted] candles,"
Rubin warned the crowd over a troublesome P.A. system. "They're stuck
in the middle!"</TE>
<TE>   As a sitar player prepared to take the microphone, 17-year-old
friends Avalon Blinn and Meredith McCall exchanged excited glances.
"A sitar!" Blinn said. "I know! Sitars are so cool!" McCall said.
Both considered themselves huge Harrison fans. "You have no idea!"
McCall said. "We may be young, but we know a lot about him," Blinn
said. She dug through her purse for a donation for Rubin's Come
Together Beatles Fan Club and gave all she could find: six cents.</TE>
<TE>   They're in the Pink</TE>
<TE>   On a recent evening slightly after 8 p.m., men in public relations
and women in skimpy dresses gathered at Michael's Room, a new bar on
Vermont Avenue, in Los Feliz Village. Owner Michael Moore (not to be
confused with the political activist and documentarian of that name;
this Moore is a former Ford model) proudly gave the curious his tour
of the nautical-themed cocktail lounge. Pointing out mahogany
paneling and lighting fixtures, Moore exclaimed, "Oh, lighting is
very important," explaining that the soft, pink light makes guests
look more attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the guests, sipping cocktails created especially for the
evening, didn't need the help from the purple bulbs, though.</TE>
<TE>   Moore pointed to a wall of framed photos which turned out, on
closer inspection, to be a retrospective exhibition of his magazine
covers as a model in the early '70s. "The wall of shame," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He reminisced about his days as a Ford model in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all jocks," he said of his former colleagues. "I didn't
believe in the style."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he said, the reason he got started in the restaurant
business was because of his hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to get my hair cut," he said, shaking white but
still foppish locks. Because he didn't want to cut his hair, he
couldn't get enough modeling jobs to support himself, he said, so he
got a job in an old Irish restaurant near 2nd Avenue and 62nd Street,

<TE>   His last creation, the Hollywood Hills Coffee Shop, was "a

<TE>   Stewart in Court</TE>
<TE>   Rod Stewart's son Sean is due in court today to be arraigned on
felony charges that he attacked a young man outside a Malibu
restaurant in December. The case earned notoriety because actor Dean
Cain, known for his TV role as Superman, reportedly captured Stewart
after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is facing charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon
(his shod foot) by means likely to produce great bodily injury and
felony battery on a person causing serious bodily injury. Both
charges carry a maximum four-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 21, allegedly attacked Jason Rogland, 19, outside Nobu
restaurant in Malibu. Rogland was knocked unconscious by boot kicks
to the head and treated at the scene by paramedics.</TE>

<LD>When I imagine hell, it takes the form of a perpetually full,
ever-descending parking garage, something similar in atmosphere and
temperature to the one under the Sunset Plaza at Crescent Heights.
The damned spend eternity in an endless, fruitless search for a space
while horns blow and brake lights blink and somewhere quite close by
a tricked-out pickup throbs with whatever music the tortured soul
hates the most.</LD>
<LD>   There is a special place in this hell for those drivers who refuse
to let another car merge in front of them.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not talking about the righteous among us who occasionally
refuse to be cowed by drivers who cut in an offramp line at the very
last minute because they're too special to inch along safely like the
rest of us, or habitual lane-changers who eschew turn-signals in the
belief that their fellow motorists should somehow be able to intuit
their intentions. We have all had our "line in the asphalt" moments
when we've kept our foot on the accelerator in the hopes of quelling
boorish behavior.</LD>
<TE>   I'm talking about people who see a blinking turn signal, any
blinking turn signal, and make it their duty to ensure that come
hell, high water or the sudden appearance of a road crew, that car is
not going to get in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   I have seen it on freeway onramps, at scenes of accidents, on
streets where two lanes suddenly whittle themselves to one. While
most drivers simply sigh and motion the would-be merger in, there is
always one person who would rather lose her temper and/or front
bumper than give up the precious six seconds it would take to let
another car cut in.</TE>
<TE>   I have seen drivers, grim jawed and steely eyed, ignore the
imploring waves of people who just want to exit the Ralph's parking
lot at some point in their lifetimes, have seen others purposefully
speed up to thwart the signaled intentions of a driver who wants to
make a right at the next intersection, have seen car after car refuse
to allow a dinged-up Datsun to merge from behind a stalled Plymouth.</TE>
<TE>   Just the other day, a gold Expedition rode on the left hip of my
car for at least a mile to make damn sure that, patient turn signal
and ingratiating smiles to the contrary, I did not rise above my
station and pull in front of him. Or in back of him--when I tried to
slow down and let him by, he slowed down, when I sped up, he sped up.
Just when I thought I was going to have to call 911, he remembered
where he was going and made a sudden left into a 7-Eleven.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I know how hard it is for us, as Americans, to let anyone get
in front of us. We are trained from childhood that getting there
first, before all the good land/gold/moon dust/oil rights have been
taken, is the prime directive. Being sent to the back of the line is
a time-honored punishment, being allowed to lead the line a reward.</TE>
<TE>   But most drivers are not trying to get to Wyoming before all the
claims are filed or to Disneyland before the Peter Pan line gets too
long. Most drivers are going to work, or school, or the grocery
store, or home and none of those places, as far as I know, gives
extra points for being first in line.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, as much as we anthropomorphize cars in this
culture, we still have a difficult time recognizing that the white
Jeep or the blue Saab that seems to be encroaching on our time and
territory is, in reality, just carrying another person who is trying
to get where she or he is headed. Very rarely do these people have
thoughts or intentions that involve us in any way. They were not sent
by our competitors to keep us from that crucial appointment, nor are
they employed by some shadow agency devoted to making our lives
miserable.</TE>
<TE>   I would say that it isn't a competition, that no one is keeping
track, except that isn't true. I am a firm believer in "carma"--that
whatever behavior you exhibit on the road will come around to either
let you in or tailgate you all the way to Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   So the next time you're seething because some jerk seems to think
it will completely wreck his life if he lets you get in front of him,
remember that he too will experience this same frustration. If not in
this world, then the next.</TE>

<LD>Have you ever run outside in your pajamas on a chilly day to catch
the cat or grab the newspaper? You were in the cold for only a
moment, but by the time you closed the door, your toes were cold and
your nose was red. When you went back out later, you were sure to
dress for the weather. An astronaut outside the space shuttle can be
exposed to temperatures as high as 250 degrees Fahrenheit and as cold
as 250 degrees below zero! That means he or she must wear special
equipment to stay safe.</LD>
<LD>   Temperature isn't the only hazard when an astronaut goes outside
the spaceship on an extravehicular activity. There's no air beyond
Earth's atmosphere, so astronauts on space walks need oxygen to
breathe. The oxygen in their suits also provides pressure, which
holds their bodies together. Tiny rocks called micrometeoroids can
hit astronauts, so spacesuits are designed to withstand a lot of
punishment.</LD>
<LD>   Their computerized spacesuits carry extra oxygen, a life support
system, headphones and microphones for communication, water to drink
and even a way to empty their bladders but still stay dry. A complete
spacesuit weighs 280 pounds on Earth, but doesn't weigh anything in
space.</LD>
<TE>   When the Space Shuttle Columbia carried the Chandra X-ray
Observatory into space in July 1999, the satellite was released into
orbit from inside the shuttle. The release worked perfectly, but if
it had not, the astronauts had their suits ready. They would have
gone outside to fix the problem. The crew's suits would have kept
them safe from extreme temperatures, lack of air and air pressure and
debris flying through space. Thanks to this mission, Chandra now
provides lots of information about high-energy objects in space, like
exploding stars.</TE>

Administration's space missions.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's something delightfully perverse about the way Nevada Barr
lovingly describes the sylvan beauty of our national parks and then
introduces a cast of cruel and greedy humans to ugly things up. In
"Hunting Season" (Putnam, $24.95, 322 pages), her 10th book about
recently promoted District Park Ranger Anna Pigeon, she mars the
forestry along Mississippi's Natchez Trace with loutish redneck
hunters, racists, sociopathic poachers, politicians and recalcitrant
deputy rangers.</LD>
<LD>   The main case on Anna's docket is a suspicious death: The nude
body of a local businessman has turned up at a resort accompanied by
signs of a sadomasochistic ritual. The investigation takes up most of
the book, with the potentially perilous aftermath of Anna's
unpleasant set-to with a bunch of macho hunters supplying the rest of
the plot. There's scarcely room left for such personal matters as her
involvement with a married man, a sheriff and an ordained Episcopal
minister, to boot.</LD>
<TE>   As has been the case with other entries in this popular series,
the characters are well-drawn, the style smooth and eminently
readable and the mystery credible if a bit too easily penetrable. The
real puzzle, and one which Barr should address, is why her smart and
sensible heroine continues to waltz into jeopardy as carelessly as a
ninny. The author successfully concocts genuinely thrilling sequences
in each book that rely on the element of surprise. (In her last
novel, "Blood Lure," there was a chilling bear attack. In "Season,"
on a dark road, Anna's vehicle is crushed by a truck from hell.) But
for the reader to believe that so bright and observant a woman would
allow herself to fall victim to a rather dull villain near novel's
end, a better rationalization is needed than the one found here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tragedy Unravels Deep</TE>
<TE>   in the Heart of Florida</TE>
<TE>   When James M. Hall is writing about Florida's flora, fauna and
fish, his prose is Hemingway clean and true. If evidence were needed,
there are two riveting battles between out-classed humans and a
powerful and wily marlin in his new "Blackwater Sound" (St. Martin's
Minotaur, $24.95, 339 pages). But as good a stylist as he is, for
some reason his series work sticks closely to the chart the late John
D. MacDonald created and wore to tatters--quirky Renaissance man
pauses in his contemplation of Florida's decline to assist
emotionally wounded heroine in battle against psychotic villains.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Hall doesn't rev things up a little. Instead of
MacDonald's philosophic salvage consultant Travis McGee, we're
presented with the moodier, edgier but equally opinionated fisherman
Thorne. He's aboard his boat, mulling over the pollution of the
Florida Keys and the end of his current romance, when a passenger
plane plummets into the drink. (A McGee adventure might have begun
with a dead woman floating in the water, but one stiff barely catches
anybody's notice these days.)</TE>
<TE>   Thorne's suspicious nature and the arrival of a less derivative
Hall protagonist, "Body Language's" crime-scene photographer
Alexandra Collins-Rafferty, whose Alzheimer's-inflicted father has
gone missing, set him off on the trail of possibly the most
dysfunctional family to appear in modern literature. Also in the mix
is a devastating death ray capable of destroying civilization as we
know it.</TE>
<TE>   MacDonald's dark devices were more personal and consequently more
frightening. A memorable one was a machine created to promote deep
slumber that was turned into a devious murder weapon by the simple
canceling of its wake-up device. But reminiscing about past mysteries
is probably as futile as bemoaning the pollution of the Keys.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Down-to-Earth Murder, Corruption and Scandal</TE>
<TE>   One of the last of the truly Philip Marlowe-like White Knight
gumshoes, Loren D. Estleman's Amos Walker is as independent, moody
and wisecracking as Thorne, and in his newest tale, "Sinister
Heights" (Mysterious Press, $24.95, 262 pages), he has as much to say
about the decline of western civilization in general and his native
territory (Detroit) in particular. "My bank, a 150-year-old Detroit
concern, had recently taken down its sign and replaced it with one
bearing a name more suited to its new conglomonational status," he
tells us. "Whether it had merged with, been bought by, or had bought
a chain of similar institutions stretching from Key West to Point
Barrow was a Chinese puzzler for its shareholders to figure out; its
immediate concern to me was that all of its services had dried up
like the ink in its ballpoint pens."</TE>
<TE>   Hired by the young widow of one of the town's movers and shakers
to locate the deceased's illegitimate heirs, Walker is skeptical but
game. The search involving three generations of the late
industrialist's discarded family includes murder, kidnapping, crooked
cops, union politics and the death of a woman very close to the
detective. There are no ray guns, S&amp;M sex sequences or poetic
descriptions of eviscerations. Just characters and situations that
seem Earthbound and, with the exception of Walker's ability to take a
licking and keep on ticking, credible. Given a choice of high concept
or high professionalism, I'll take the latter any time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anthology of Voices Old and New to Noir</TE>
<TE>   One of the suspense genre's more discerning editors, Michele
Slung, has followed her popular collections, "I Shudder at Your
Touch" and "Shudder Again," with "Stranger: Dark Tales of Eerie
Encounters" (Perennial, $13.95, 371 pages), 22 noir gems that shine
like blood rubies. It's not surprising to find Tabitha King or H.P.
Lovecraft or Richard Matheson being represented. Nor do Ray Bradbury
and Shirley Jackson seem to be in the wrong anthology. But it's nice
to be reminded that Edith Wharton, for all of "Ethan Frome," "The Age
of Innocence," etc., was no slouch when it came to conjuring up
chills.</TE>

<LD>The cry of "Play ball!" soon will echo throughout the land.</LD>
<LD>   From Little Leaguers to major leaguers, the Great American Pastime
again will come alive.</LD>
<LD>   Last year the U.S. Postal Service issued a fitting tribute to
baseball's "Legendary Playing Fields" with a series of stamps that
featured the home sites of teams long remembered and forever
cherished.</LD>
<TE>   Depicted were Crosley Field (Cincinnati), Ebbets Field (Brooklyn,
N.Y.), Comiskey Park and Wrigley Field (Chicago), Yankee Stadium and
the Polo Grounds (New York), Shibe Park (Philadelphia), Fenway Park
(Boston), Forbes Field (Pittsburgh), Tiger Stadium (Detroit) and
Sportsman's Park (St. Louis).</TE>
<TE>   To fans everywhere, these legendary sites are shrines where
history, tradition and folklore intersect between the chalk lines.</TE>
<TE>   Each one of these ballparks has moments that live in sports
history.</TE>
<TE>   The Polo Grounds, razed in 1964, was at one time home to the
Giants, Yankees and briefly the Mets. The entire 1921 and 1922 World
Series were played there.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbets Field, also razed, made history when on April 26, 1939, the
first televising of a major league game took place there.</TE>
<TE>   Shibe Park was badly damaged by fire in 1971 and razed in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Author Lawrence R. Ritter ("Lost Ballparks") commented about these
fields of dreams: "They had their faults, no doubt, but they had
magic, magic that will live for years in the memories of those who
were lucky enough to have passed through their turnstiles."</TE>
<TE>   These stamps still are available through the Stamp Fulfillment
Services of the  Postal Service. You can order them by calling (800)
STAMP-24.</TE>
<TE>   Antigua and Barbuda, a former British colony in the eastern
Caribbean, has commemorated the legacy of the American Civil War with
a set of 30 different stamps and two souvenir sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Highlighted on the stamps are major battles of that war--from the
Battle of Bull Run in 1861 to the surrender of Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox in 1865.</TE>
<TE>   The stamps of Antigua and Barbuda are available at your local
dealer.</TE>

<HD>Meet Dr. Seuss</HD>
<DH>Part 3 The story so far: Born into a happy family, Ted
Geisel, today known as Dr. Seuss, enjoyed drawing odd creatures even
through college years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLORIA D. MIKLOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After college in America, Ted Geisel enrolled at Oxford University in
England but quickly felt "appallingly ignorant." He preferred
sketching instead of reading required books. One day an American
woman in his class, named Helen Marion Palmer, stared over his
shoulder as their professor discussed the poem "Paradise Lost."
Instead of taking notes, Ted was drawing an angel sliding down a
sunbeam, oiling the beam as he went, from a can resembling a tuba.
"You're crazy to be a professor," she said after class. "What you
really want to do is draw."</LD>
<LD>   Ted and Helen became good friends and fell in love. They traveled
through parts of Europe on a motorcycle, partied with friends and
studied together. But Ted left Oxford after a year, returning to
Springfield.</LD>
<LD>   He hoped to make a living from his artwork and began showing his
cartoons to editors in New York, but none was interested. Then he got
a lucky break. The editor of Judge, a humor magazine, offered him a
job as writer and artist for $75 a week. Now he could afford to marry
Helen.</LD>
<TE>   His first cartoon ran in October 1927. He signed it Seuss, after
his mother's maiden name, and added Dr. soon after, saying he
deserved the honor for the doctorate he never won at Oxford.</TE>
<TE>   While working at Judge, Ted continued to send cartoons to other
magazines. One morning he received a letter from the Saturday Evening
Post. It contained a check for $25 for a cartoon he'd sent them. A
big break came when one of Ted's cartoons appeared in Judge. It
showed a knight in armor angry at a dragon on his bed. The knight
said, "Darn it all, another Dragon, and just when I sprayed the whole
castle with Flit." When the company advertising Flit (a bug killer)
saw the cartoon, it hired Ted. For the next 17 years he drew Flit
cartoons, and "Quick, Henry, the Flit" became a household phrase. By
1931 he was earning $12,000 a year from his clever Flit cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: What made Ted decide to write for children?</TE>
<TE>   Kids, March is the fifth anniversary of the National Education
Assn.'s Read Across America project, which celebrates the joys of
reading and honors Dr. Seuss, whose birthday is Saturday. For more

<HD>The Story of Narcocorridos--Right or Wrong</HD>
<DH>Elijah Wald's book documents the history of the
controversial ballads that heroize Mexican drug traders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bouncing around the roads of rural Mexico with long-haul truckers who
picked him up hitchhiking, Elijah Wald had a captive audience. And
that is exactly what the Cambridge, Mass., native wanted.</LD>
<LD>   A former world-music critic for the Boston Globe, Wald was
launched on an unusual yearlong quest that would produce a book
chronicling the history of the narcocorrido, the modern-day twist on
the ballads of rural Mexico traditionally sung by men and driven by
accordion-style polkas and waltzes.</LD>
<LD>   Evolving in 19th century rural Mexico from Spanish minstrel
styles, corridos told heroic tales of outlaws, smuggling and gunmen.
But in recent years, they had morphed into controversial songs that
recounted the exploits of Mexico's contemporary drug trade.</LD>
<TE>   Though Wald had set off hitchhiking to save money, he soon
realized that being stuck with lonely and garrulous blue-collar truck
drivers for hours on end was the perfect way to research his topic.</TE>
<TE>   "All the truck drivers are corrido nuts," says Wald, who speaks
Spanish. "I'd tell them what I was doing, and they'd pull out tapes.
One guy stopped at three different places until we found the tape he
wanted me to listen to. They also had a lot of lore, not only about
the subject but about the corridos and the singers. It was a very
good education, as well as giving me a feel for the audience."</TE>
<TE>   Some might wonder if Wald felt nervous hitchhiking and asking
questions about a subculture filled with murderous characters who
shoot first and ask questions later.</TE>
<TE>   But Wald, who first hitchhiked through Mexico in 1987 with his
guitar, playing for tips, finds the country "one of the most
massively hospitable places on the planet." Using truckers' help and
making inquiries as he went, Wald tracked down singers and
songwriters, sometimes in remote parts of rural Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Some were famous. Others had never been interviewed before. Wald
writes that many were initially suspicious and feared he would steal
their songs.</TE>
<TE>   But they were eventually won over by his tenacity, enthusiasm and
love of music--Wald is an accomplished guitarist and approached the
musicians as a fellow musician, often playing for them and recording
their music on a player he carried everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Out of Wald's research comes "Narcocorrido, A Journey into the
Music of Drugs, Guns and Guerrillas." Published in November by Rayo
Press, an imprint of Harper Collins, the book is available in Spanish
and English. In conjunction with the book, Fonovisa has released a
companion CD of songs ("Corridos y Narcocorridos") handpicked by Wald
and featuring corrido giants discussed in the book such as Los Tigres
del Norte and Lupillo Rivera. "How often in a writer's life do you
get a whole field of music which no one has done a book on," asks
Wald, who is up for two Grammys tonight for work on other projects.
"You can use the corrido as a window to look into just about anything
contemporary in Mexican culture through eyes of working-class
songwriters rather than educated elites.</TE>
<TE>   "Every important composer of the corrido, with the exception of
Chalino [who was murdered in Sinaloa in 1992] is still around and
more than willing to talk."</TE>
<TE>   A fast-paced blend of music, history, personal travel memoir and
reportage, "Narcocorrido" has been praised for its insights into a
musical genre that has been little-known outside working-class and
rural Mexican communities on both sides of the border. The book is
unique, says Guillermo E. Hernandez, a professor of Spanish and
director of the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center, who says that
Wald "had an insight into the culture that few outsiders have had."</TE>
<TE>   It is only now that the populist music is beginning to get some
respect and attention from the academic and literary worlds.</TE>
<TE>   "The genre of corridos themselves has been marginalized as a folk
tradition among rural people, and learned and educated people came to
disdain it, they didn't think there was value to it," says Hernandez.
But Wald's work helps change that. "He's dealing with the genius of
the composer and the folk tradition that feeds them. He went beyond
the drug world to understand that the genre has a network of
composers, and some are humble people who compose and perform their
songs in buses and others travel in private jets and play before
thousands of people."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, you might call Wald a rogue sociologist who specializes in
fieldwork collecting the stories of contemporary troubadours. He
wants to document their origins, their history, their struggles and
their victories. And often in the book, you get the feeling that for
Wald, the journey is as enjoyable as the destination.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking Down</TE>
<TE>   Songwriters</TE>
<TE>   One wordsmith Wald was eager to track down was Paulino Vargas,
whose songs dating from the 1950s he had heard in the New York office
of American folklorist Alan Lomax. Told that Vargas lived in Durango,
Wald hitchhiked there, only to learn that he had moved to Mexico
City. So he stuck out his thumb and got a ride to the capital, where
the trail led him to a corner store and a young woman who promised to
pass on the message.</TE>
<TE>   That evening Vargas called, and they agreed to meet at the store,
which turned out to be owned by his daughter. The great songwriter
lived in an apartment upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Songwriters are a pretty articulate bunch; they're funny and
eloquent, even those that can't read and write," Wald says. "I wanted
to give them a way to talk about it in their own words, because these
are fascinating people."</TE>
<TE>   Wald recounts how many of the songwriters and musicians came from
grinding poverty and were functionally illiterate, although others
are self-educated men whose bookshelves were crammed with philosophy
and history.</TE>
<TE>   Wald talked to songwriters commissioned by drug lords to compose
odes to their glory, a common practice in drug-fueled states such as
Sinaloa.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sinaloan hill town of Badiraguato, which is widely known as
the birthplace of generations of marijuana and cocaine traffickers,
Wald tracked down one man who, as the tale went, had been kidnapped
by some narcos and locked in a room until he had composed a corrido
of their deeds.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the musician at last, Wald put the question to him and was
told with a laugh that the writer composed the song voluntarily for
the drug trafficker and that the whole business took less than an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Other songwriters told Wald that they preferred not to name names
in the songs, since this could lead to trouble. And in general, Wald
writes, anyone with money can hire a songwriter to pen a tune.</TE>
<TE>   "They give me a list telling me the name of their ranchos, what
they do for a living, if they want me to mention what they do for a
living," one Sinaloan songwriter told Wald. "Some want their name to
be used, some not ... because if a corrido comes out saying that they
have two, three women and he has a wife at home, when he gets back
she'll be after him with a broomstick."</TE>
<TE>   Using Ballads to Spread the News</TE>
<TE>   Throughout rural Mexico where literacy rates are low, the corrido
traditionally was used as a sort of oral "newspaper" to spread the
news. Today that practice continues. Wald interviewed corridistas
writing about the Zapatista guerrillas of Chiapas and peasant
massacres in Guerrero. The book cites corridos snatched from the
headlines on both sides of the border: corruption scandals involving
former Mexican President Carlos Salinas and his brother Raul; the
plight of undocumented workers; drug addiction; the Gulf War; the
1992 Los Angeles riots and even the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, in
which the former U.S. president is lauded for his amatory prowess.</TE>
<TE>   Wald also visited Los Angeles, which he calls "the new corrido
frontier," where the narcocorrido genre flourishes thanks to a
plethora of record companies, singers, songwriters, clubs and
thousands of young Mexican American fans. In Los Angeles, at least
one radio station tried to promote itself by not playing any
corridos. Several Mexican states have banned narcocorridos from the
radio altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, almost everyone involved with corridos is sensitive to
allegations that many of the songs glorify drug lords and drug use.
However, the singers and songwriters say they're only chronicling
real life and point out that the best songs discuss the plague of
drug addiction and violent death as well as the perceived glory of
the trade. Many laud the corrido for providing young people with
insight on their musical heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "Were it not for the narcocorrido, they'd be listening to Eminem,
but now they listen to the narcocorrido,  and it gets them into this
whole Mexican pride, and soon they're listening to Jose Alfredo
Jimenez," says Wald, citing a 1950s Mexican star who combined the
songwriting ability of George Gershwin with the fame of Frank
Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   At least one review has faulted Wald for not explaining the
corrido within the context of Mexico and America's war on drugs, but
his is not an academic or political treatise, nor is it the knowing
tale of an insider.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Rene Alegria, editorial director of Rayo Publishing, says
Wald's distance from the culture actually helped him understand the
music.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in the fold, it's sometimes difficult to have
perspective," Alegria says. "There's really no book out there like
this that addresses the music in a broader context: socially,
historically and especially the oral tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Corridos are only the latest manifestation of Wald's passion for
indigenous and roots music. One of Wald's Grammy nominations is for
best historical album as co-producer, with Chris Strachwitz, of the
40th anniversary collection of Arhoolie Records, the California label
specializing in blues and ethnic music. Wald also wrote the liner
notes, which have been nominated in the best album notes category.</TE>
<TE>   The book and the Grammy nomination cap a lifetime of interest in
American music for Wald, who recalls playing Woody Guthrie songs on
guitar at age 7. He calls himself a "traditional American musician"
who at various times has played jazz, blues, New Orleans and roots
music.</TE>
<TE>   Though he has studied with musicians on three continents, Wald
attended New York University for only one year, and then only because
it was near Greenwich Village, where he wanted to study with a
particular guitarist.</TE>
<TE>   He then spent a decade traveling the globe, supporting himself for
a time as a blues musician in Seville, Spain. After moving back to
Cambridge, he landed a job as world music critic for the Globe. He
has also written a critically praised biography about a blues legend
called "Josh White: Society Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Wald's next project delves into the legend of blues musician
Robert Johnson. Meanwhile, he's enjoying feedback from corrido
singers and songwriters in Mexico who have read the book in Spanish
as well as Latin American bands on this side of the border.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm intensely aware of how lucky I am," Wald says. "This isn't my
culture, I haven't grown up around corridos. But people have been
very helpful and encouraging. There's been no backlash. It's not like
there were all these people running around trying to interview
corrido composers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wald will read at UCLA's Chicano Studies Research Center on
Thursday at 3:30 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Regarding Mary Rourke's interesting article about Lent ("Giving It Up
for Lent," Feb. 13), I would like to make a clarification regarding
the Russian Orthodox Lent tradition. Rourke lumps all Eastern
Orthodox traditions together, when she describes Orthodox diet. In
fact, the Russian Orthodox diet is much stricter. During the first
two and the last day of Lent one should fast completely. On Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays during Lent one should keep dry fast (nuts
vegetables and fruit that require no cooking) and eat only once a
day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, one still eats once a day but is
allowed cooked food--it has to be strictly vegetarian (no animal or
animal-based products of any type), prepared without any kind of oil.
On Saturdays and Sundays, one can indulge in two strictly vegetarian
hot meals with oil and on Palm Sunday, one is allowed some fish.</LD>

<HD>Yogurt Cheesecake: We're Down With It</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yogurt cheese, a thick, creamy, tangy yogurt concentrate, is a
wonderful substitute for sour cream in many dessert recipes. It's
made by spooning nonfat plain yogurt into a cheesecloth-lined
strainer, putting it in the refrigerator and letting the yogurt drain
several hours.</LD>
<LD>   In this cheese tart, yogurt cheese, low-fat ricotta cheese and egg
whites take the place of their high-fat counterparts, while the crust
is made of vanilla wafer crumbs patted into a lightly buttered baking
pan. The tart is missing only the fat and calories of a cheesecake,
not the flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Be sure to use a food processor to give the cheese mixture a
light, fluffy texture with the greatest possible volume.</LD>
<TE>   Ginger Cheese Tart</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour plus
6 to 8 hours standing</TE>
<TE>   1 quart plain nonfat yogurt</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1 cup vanilla wafer crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1 cup low-fat ricotta cheese</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup nonfat milk</TE>
<TE>   3 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 tablespoons cake flour</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup minced candied ginger</TE>
<TE>   1 cup raspberries</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sliced strawberries</TE>
<TE>   To make the yogurt cheese, place the yogurt in a fine-mesh
strainer lined with cheesecloth. Fold the cheesecloth to cover the
yogurt and let it stand over a deep bowl in the refrigerator for 6 to
8 hours or overnight. Discard any liquid in the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly butter the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan. Sprinkle
the vanilla wafer crumbs evenly over the bottom of the pan and pat
them firmly in place.</TE>
<TE>   Combine 2 cups of the yogurt cheese, the ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup
of sugar, nonfat milk, egg whites, cake flour and vanilla in the bowl
of a food processor. Process the cheese filling until blended. Stir
in the ginger and pour into the crust.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the tart just until set, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool to warm.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the raspberries, strawberries and the remaining 2
tablespoons of sugar in a food processor or blender and puree. Serve
with the tart.</TE>

<HD>Of Crust and Custard</HD>
<DH>From a 1909 women's club cookbook comes a dessert
revelation: pies that are exquisitely textured, deeply delicious and
easy to make.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SYLVIA THOMPSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The running border through the pages of "Crumbs From Everybody's
Table" reads "Send Your Newly Married Friend a Copy of 'Crumbs From
Everybody's Table.'" Clearly someone followed this advice, because it
was my grandmother's first cookbook when she became Mrs. Frank
Stewart in 1909.</LD>
<LD>   "Crumbs" is a turn-of-the-century collection of recipes gathered
from women around the Salinas Valley--women like my grandmother
Alice, who had been born and raised just over the Coast Range in
Selma in the Great Valley. The easy availability of ingredients was
taken for granted--almost every fruit and vegetable grown in
California was farmed nearby--as was an abundance of oysters, wild
birds and game, to say nothing of the usual fish, poultry and meat.</LD>
<LD>   After she moved to Ocean Park (now a neighborhood of Santa
Monica), where her young husband was a postal inspector by day and a
law student by night, the food was not as varied and, of course, it
was more expensive. Still my mother--Alice's and Frank's
firstborn--remembers her childhood as a blur of glorious meals at her
mother's table. No crumbs left on it, ever.</LD>
<TE>   Like most community cookbooks from any time or place, half of
"Crumbs" is devoted to sweet things. "Puddings and Their Sauces" get
23 pages. "Fancy Desserts" get 16 pages. "Frozen Dainties," 11 pages.
There are, sigh, 55 pages of "Cakes and Cake Fillings." Other days,
perhaps we can look into each of them. But right now the pie chapter
is on my mind.</TE>
<TE>   That's because recently I happened to serve a friend Mrs. E.
Williams' Transparent Pie. Now transparent pie is not truly
transparent, though its filling is a custard that's at least
translucent (perhaps even that is stretching it). Nor, some would
argue, is it truly a pie--having just one crust makes it a tart.
Perhaps Mrs. Williams was a Southern girl, since the pie is an
heirloom from the South. (Funny thing; I've seen a dozen recipes for
transparent pie, and all they have in common is the title.)</TE>
<TE>   For flavoring, Mrs. Williams calls for "white jelly [tart]." The
first time I made the pie, I used quince jelly because I had some I'd
just put up from our pineapple quince tree. It was a felicitous
choice, because the quince's floral flavor and perfume--quinces are
cousins of roses, remember?--were heavenly. If you don't happen to
have quince jelly on your shelf, look for it in ultra-fancy groceries
(yes, it will be expensive). Then make the tart for someone special.</TE>
<TE>   My friend pronounced it one of his all-time favorite desserts and
ate two helpings. So when I had another menu to plan, I went back to
"Crumbs" and the pie chapter. Turning the 15 pages gently (I lose
flakes of pages every time I open the book, alas), I noticed a
surprising number had custard fillings. When I came across Mrs. J.W.
Stirling's Squash Pie, I remembered it was the one I'd baked for
Thanksgiving, which had been declared the best "pumpkin" pie any of
us had ever eaten.</TE>
<TE>   Part of what enchants me about these old-fashioned recipes is that
after the list of ingredients, the directions range from none to
terse. In her transparent pie recipe, Mrs. Williams goes so far as to
say, "Bake with under crust only." In those days, every girl helped
her mother or whoever was in the kitchen, and she breathed in cookery
knowledge with the aromas from simmering pots and roasting pans.</TE>
<TE>   This time I decided to make a plain custard pie, largely because I
was enchanted by the directions for the nutmeg:</TE>
<TE>   "CUSTARD PIE: Line a pie plate with good crust, pinching an extra
brim around the top that the custard may be the depth of the plate.
Grate nutmeg over bottom until well sprinkled with it. Beat four eggs
well with three-fourths cupful of sugar, then add little over a pt.
of milk. Bake in moderate oven. Sufficient for large sized pie.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. E. F. Hawkins."</TE>
<TE>   This also proved to be perfection. Three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   What these pies have in common is their simplicity, their purity.
They are easy as pie to make. You'll find the filling goes together
one-two-three: Measure, whisk and pour into the shell. Only the
Transparent Pie filling wants anything so fussy as creaming.</TE>
<TE>   An enormous part of what makes these recipes so splendid is the
flaky pastry dough I use. It comes from Jim Dodge, formerly the
pastry chef at the Stanford Court hotel in San Francisco and now in
charge of food service at the Getty Center. He is a brilliant,
original thinker, constantly simplifying and elevating his art, and
this pastry dough is remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   Custard pies are a fascinating genre, particularly the simple,
old-fashioned ones, because there are no hiding places for sloppiness
or flaws. I've learned a lot about their ins and outs and, while
there will always be more to learn, what I know now I'm handing on to
you. Just as Mrs. Hawkins, Mrs. Baker, Mrs. Stirling and Mrs.
Williams--and Mr. Dodge--have handed on what they loved creating to
me.</TE>
<TE>   Under the chapter "Pies" is written a quote from Longfellow:
"Who'll dare deny the truth, there's poetry in pie?"</TE>
<TE>   Not me.</TE>
<TE>   Nutmeg Custard Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   From Mrs. E.F. Hawkins, perfection of a classic.</TE>
<TE>   2 1/4 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1 cup eggs (about 5 eggs)</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1 (9-inch) baked Flaky Pie Pastry</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 teaspoons nutmeg, preferably freshly grated, divided</TE>
<TE>   Line a baking sheet with foil and set it on the middle rack of the
oven; heat the oven to 450 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the milk, eggs, sugar and vanilla in a mixing bowl. Whisk
until the ingredients are thoroughly blended.</TE>
<TE>   Warm the pastry shell on the baking sheet in the oven for 5
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the baking sheet and shell from the oven and sprinkle 1
teaspoon of the nutmeg over the bottom of the shell. Whisk the
custard to blend again, then pour through a fine sieve into the
shell.</TE>
<TE>   Set the baking sheet and pie in the oven and bake 10 minutes.
Place a tent of foil over the pie, shiny side up. Reduce the
temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking until the custard
tests ready to remove using the jiggle test: Give a gentle shake to
the pie, and the center (it can be an area as large as the center
half of the pie) will jiggle like gelatin, rather than look wet and
soupy--about 30 minutes more. Cool; then, if necessary, refrigerate
until an hour or so before serving.</TE>
<TE>   Just before serving, sprinkle the remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
over the top.</TE>

<TE>   Fresh Butternut Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours, 15
minutes</TE>
<TE>   From Mrs. J. W. Stirling, a light, exquisitely flavored custard
that is unrivaled among winter squash (a.k.a. pumpkin) pies.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds butternut, hubbard, kuri or other richly flavored
dry-fleshed winter squash</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup eggs (about 3 eggs)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons light molasses</TE>
<TE>   2 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   Rounded 1/8 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 (9-inch) baked Flaky Pie Pastry</TE>
<TE>   1 cup whipping cream, chilled, beaten to soft peaks, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Cut the squash in inch-size cubes, discarding the seeds and
strings. Steam until tender (about 20 minutes), cut off the peel,
then puree the squash in a food processor or food mill. You will need
1 1/2 cups of puree.</TE>
<TE>   Line a baking sheet with foil and set it on the bottom rack (or
middle rack, if you prefer) of the oven; heat the oven to 450
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the squash, milk, eggs, sugar, molasses, ginger, cinnamon
and salt in a mixing bowl. Whisk until the ingredients are thoroughly
blended.</TE>
<TE>   Warm the pastry shell on the baking sheet in the oven for 5
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the baking sheet and shell from the oven. Whisk the custard
to blend once again, then pour through a fine sieve into the shell.</TE>
<TE>   Set the baking sheet and shell in the oven and bake 10 minutes. If
on the bottom rack, carefully move the sheet and pie up to the center
rack. Place a tent of foil over the pie, shiny side up. Reduce the
temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking until the custard
tests ready to remove using the quarter test (remove the pie when the
distinct pool of unset custard in the center has shrunk to the size
of a quarter) or the knife test (insert a table knife just
off-center, and when it comes out with solid bits of custard
attached, it's ready)--about 40 minutes more. Cool; then, if
necessary, refrigerate until an hour or so before serving with a
dollop of unsweetened whipped cream.</TE>

<TE>   After Mrs. E. Williams' recipe. Sublime. You can substitute crab
apple or guava jelly. This pie comes together slowly while baking.
Don't panic if it still looks a little liquid after the initial
baking period. Just keep baking and watch carefully. When finished,
there may be some melted butter on top. It will firm up during the
cooling.</TE>

<TE>   Jim Dodge's Remarkable Flaky Pie Pastry</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour plus
20 minutes chilling</TE>
<TE>   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more
for dusting</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted European-style butter, or 1/4 cup (1/2
stick) butter and 1/4 cup lard or shortening, cold</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons cold water</TE>
<TE>   Place the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl and blend with
your fingertips. Cut the butter into thin 1/2-inch chips and add to
the bowl. Toss the mixture with your hands until each chip is coated
with flour.</TE>
<TE>   Turn onto a broad work surface. Roll out until the butter chips
have turned into long flakes; use a flexible scraper to gently remove
pieces that stick to the pin or board and coat them with flour.</TE>
<TE>   Return the mixture to the bowl. Sprinkle it with water and blend
with a large rubber spatula or kitchen spoon until the water has been
absorbed, about 15 strokes. Dust the top lightly with flour, then
press the mixture down into the bowl--4 or 5 gentle pushes will press
everything together.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinkle the work surface with flour and turn the dough out onto
it. Dust the rolling pin generously with flour. Dust the dough with
flour and roll it into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. The dough
will be loose, but fold the long edges over to meet in the center.
Give the package a turn so the long way runs side to side. Roll out,
fold and turn as before until the dough begins to hold together,
usually 2 more times.</TE>
<TE>   Fold over the corners and press into a 6-inch round. The dough can
be rolled out at once or wrapped and refrigerated. If chilled, let it
rest at room temperature until soft enough to roll.</TE>
<TE>   Place the round on your lightly floured work surface and dust the
top with flour. Roll out into a 13-inch circle. Brush off any flour
and roll the circle up loosely on the pin a little more than halfway,
brushing off flour underneath. Slide the pie dish underneath it and
unroll the pin over it, centering the circle.</TE>
<TE>   Gently push the dough down into the corners at the bottom of the
dish, then firmly up against the sides without stretching the dough
(this is important).</TE>
<TE>   Make the border fairly even all around (it doesn't have to be
perfect) by trimming any excess with scissors and using these scraps
to patch any skimpy places (drops of cold water will seal the seams).
Tuck the border under itself to make the edge even with the rim.</TE>
<TE>   Finish the border by fluting (poke the tip of a finger into the
dough on one side and pinch it on the other side, making a V; repeat
right next to the V and so forth around the border) or impressing an
edging with the tines of a fork.</TE>
<TE>   Chill for 20 to 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   For crisp pastry under custard pies, the shell must be fully baked
before filling. Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the dough from shrinking and puffing as it bakes, it must
be held in place for the first 2/3 of baking. Cut 2 sheets of foil or
parchment paper about 15 inches long. Lay them in the dish at right
angles. Fill the shell to the rim with metal pie weights, dried
beans, rice or a combination--you'll need at least 5 cups (7 is
ideal). As you pour in the weights, press them firmly down into the
corners at the bottom of the dish and up against the sides; also fill
every V of fluting. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes,
then carefully lift out the foil or paper and weights (save them for
next time). Continue baking, checking after 3 to 4 minutes to make
sure the pastry isn't puffing up. If it is, prick the bubbles with a
fork. Continue baking, checking again a few minutes later for
puffing, until the pastry is golden all over, 10 to 15 minutes in
all. Cool if not filling at once.</TE>

<HD>24 Keys to Pie Perfection</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>These pies are pure and delicate, and the flavor of every element
shimmers through. For this reason, it is imperative that ingredients
are freshest of the fresh and finest of the fine.</LD>
<LD>   * Eggs should be fresh. Milk should be fresh and whole, neither
low-fat, nor nonfat, nor evaporated. For extra richness, you can use
some part or even all half-and-half.</LD>
<LD>   * Vanilla extract should be pure, not artificial.</LD>
<TE>   * Cane sugar dissolves quickly and uniformly; beet sugar can be
coarse and temperamental. Look for "pure cane sugar" on the label.
Salt should be chemical-free kosher or from the sea.</TE>
<TE>   * European-style butter contains less water than standard butter
and is superior for baking. But use American butter for fillings--the
extra fat in European may cause the custard to "weep" butter. The
lard you may use in pastry will probably be from a package, not top
quality--rendered leaf lard is best--so be sure it smells very sweet.</TE>
<TE>   * Measure eggs by volume rather than by count to ensure
uniformity.</TE>
<TE>   * When beating the eggs or the custard mixture itself, do not beat
more than to blend--excess air forced into the custard deflates once
the cooked pie has cooled and can mar its fragile texture.</TE>
<TE>   * Have all custard ingredients at room temperature. You can warm
cold eggs in their shell by covering them with hot water for 5
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   * Whenever butter is called for in a custard pie filling, do not
add it melted, but soften it and whisk it in to disperse through the
filling. In baking, melted butter in a custard can surface in
droplets, then congeal unappetizingly when cooled.</TE>
<TE>   * Most custard mixtures should be strained through a sieve as they
go into the shell, to be sure the texture is silken.</TE>
<TE>   * If you wish to turn a favorite custard recipe into a pie
filling, you'll need 4 cups--41/2 cups maximum--to fill a baked
9-inch shell.</TE>
<TE>   * In an emergency, most custard fillings can be prepared and
refrigerated for one day, but then they should be warmed before going
into the warmed pie shell. Set the mixture in the top of a double
boiler over simmering water and whisk or stir with a wooden spoon
until warmed through. This can be risky, however, and the filling is
no longer fresh.</TE>
<TE>   * Curdling--the custard turning watery and separating after
cooling--results from the eggs overcooking, the consequence of heat
that's too high or applied too long. A jump-start gets everything
moving quickly. The first step is to pour the custard into a
warm-to-hot pastry shell, then set the pie on a hot baking sheet and
start the baking at a high temperature. The most critical step to
avoid curdling comes at the end of baking, when you must remove the
pie from the oven the instant the filling tests done.</TE>
<TE>   * The best oven temperature to start most custards at is 450
degrees for 10 minutes. Custards with butter or chocolate--i.e.,
fat--in them are best started at 425 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   * Some old-fashioned cooks start their custard pies on a hot
baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven, closest to the heat,
then move it to the middle rack for the rest of the baking. I do this
when I feel I can safely move the hot pie on its hot sheet without
the soupy filling sloshing over the pastry border.</TE>
<TE>   * Remember that custard continues to cook after it comes out of
the oven. It will set completely when cooled. Recognizing the instant
to remove the pie from the oven--allowing for this residual
cooking--is crucial. The moment can arrive quickly, three to four
minutes after the last time you checked, so toward the end of baking,
be vigilant.</TE>
<TE>   * There are three ways to tell when it's time to remove a custard
pie from the oven. Because every custard has its own mysterious mode
of setting, not all tests apply to all pies, but at least one will
work for each.</TE>
<TE>   First, try the jiggle test: Give a gentle shake to the pie and the
center--it can be an area as large as the center half of the
pie--will jiggle like gelatin, rather than look wet and soupy.</TE>
<TE>   Or, try the quarter test: Remove the pie when the distinct pool of
unset custard in the center has shrunk to the size of a quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, try the knife test: Insert a table knife just
off-center--when it comes out with solid bits of custard attached,
it's ready. Be aware, though, that the gash will probably remain once
cooled.</TE>
<TE>   * For your beautiful custard pie, try to choose an aesthetic
heatproof glass or ceramic pie dish rather than a utilitarian metal
pie pan. The vessel itself is part of the presentation.</TE>
<TE>   * Old-fashioned pie dishes had rims but some dishes today are made
rimless. When possible, choose a dish with a rim--a border of golden
crust is a matchless frame.</TE>
<TE>   * For crisp pastry under custard pies, always use a flaky pastry
dough. Crumb crusts become soggy. The shell must be fully baked
before the filling goes in. This is called baking blind. Curiously,
the pastry does not burn in its second baking, although a tent of
foil is sometimes used to keep the rim from getting dark.</TE>
<TE>   * It's a quirky matter of taste, but I find all-butter pastry
better suited to chocolate and vanilla-flavored custards, but
half-lard pastry luscious in fruit-flavored pies (technically, squash
is a fruit).</TE>
<TE>   * The flavors of custards are at their fullest when barely warm or
at room temperature. Chocolate pies, where texture takes precedence
over flavor, are creamiest when almost cold.</TE>
<TE>   * Usually, the pie will cool to serving temperature in 11/2 to 2
hours. Due to the danger of spoilage, you must refrigerate custard
pie, lightly covered, for storing after it has thoroughly cooled. It
will keep up to one week.</TE>
<TE>   * If the pie is cold, remove it from the refrigerator an hour or
so before serving or slip it into a very low oven to shake off the
chill.</TE>
<TE>   * If you decide to use a ready-made refrigerated pie shell, such
as those by Pillsbury, place the crust in the pie dish and shape the
edges. Prick the bottom all over with a fork. Bake the shell at 450
degrees until lightly browned, 5 minutes. Fill the shell with the
custard, cover the exposed crust with strips of foil (in addition to
a foil tent) and proceed with the pie recipe.</TE>

<LD>Couscous is so easy--it cooks in minutes and pairs nicely with many
dishes. Here it's a good base for seared scallops, which have a
delicate, buttery texture.</LD>
<LD>   Pineapple juice and roasted red peppers add color and tang to the
couscous, but you can adjust this recipe to what you have on hand.
Replace the pineapple juice with orange, apple or tomato juice, if
you'd like; substitute green peppers for the red and orange segments,
apple or tomato for the pineapple.</LD>
<LD>   You can save time by using a jar of roasted red bell peppers. I
also make this recipe with chicken or other white fish; both are
delicious and low in fat.</LD>

<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   COUSCOUS</TE>
<TE>   1 (20-ounce) can crushed pineapple in its own juice</TE>
<TE>   1 cup roasted red bell peppers, drained and diced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup finely chopped fresh mint leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lime juice</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup diced red onion</TE>
<TE>   1 cup couscous</TE>
<TE>   Drain the pineapple, pressing on it with the back of a spoon,
reserving all of the juice (1 1/4 cups). To make the salsa, combine
the pineapple with the peppers, mint, cilantro and lime juice. Season
to taste with salt and cayenne pepper. Place 1/2 cup of the salsa in
a small bowl and set aside. Place the remaining salsa in a large
mixing bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion
and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the reserved
pineapple juice and bring to a boil. Stir in the couscous, cover and
remove from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Gently add the
couscous to the larger bowl of salsa and combine. Season to taste
with salt.</TE>
<TE>   SCALLOPS</TE>
<TE>   20 very large sea scallops, about 1 1/4 pounds</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   Place the scallops on a plate and season both sides with salt and
pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the
pan is very hot but not smoking, add the scallops. Sear for about 2
minutes. Turn and sear the other side for about 1 1/2 minutes. The
scallops should be nicely browned and just starting to crack.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the couscous evenly among 4 plates and top each with
scallops. Divide the remaining 1/2 cup of salsa over the scallops for
garnish.</TE>

<LD>"The 2000 Borsao Tres Picos Garnacha 'Campo de Borja.' Spanish
Grenache is very black, just incredible. The old Grenache in
California--I don't think anyone knows if it's the clone or the way
it's grown--is nice and fruity but lacks color and tannin depth. This
wine is a great example of some of the black, very dark, intense
Grenache that we get from the south of France. This is another
example of a well-done European Grenache."</LD>

<LD>My teenagers issued an ultimatum the other night: No more pastas with
exotic sauces--give them good old spaghetti and meatballs. So I made
a big batch, knowing that the leftover sauce and meatballs would make
a terrific filling for calzone.</LD>
<LD>   Set aside one cup of pasta sauce and 16 meatballs, and you'll have
the right amount to quickly put together these folded, stuffed
pizzas. They make for a fun, informal weeknight supper; just toss a
salad and serve.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan is author of "The Thanksgiving Table: Recipes and Ideas to
Create Your Own Holiday Tradition" (Chronicle Books, $18.95).</LD>
<TE>   Calzone Filled With Meatballs and Mozzarella</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Cornmeal</TE>
<TE>   2 (10-ounce) tubes refrigerated pizza dough or 20 ounces pizza
dough</TE>
<TE>   Flour</TE>
<TE>   1 cup marinara pasta sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 pound meatballs, cut in half (about 16)</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups (5 ounces) grated mozzarella</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Lightly dust 2 baking sheets with
cornmeal and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the pizza dough into 4 even portions. Roll each into a ball
and then flatten into a disk shape. Lightly sprinkle a work surface
with a little cornmeal and, using a floured rolling pin, roll each
disk into a 9-inch circle about 1/4-inch to 1/8-inch thick.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the marinara sauce among the circles of dough, spreading it
around the center of the dough and within 1 inch of the edges. Divide
the meatballs among the circles, placing them on the lower half of
each piece of dough.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the meatballs evenly with the grated cheese. Fold the top
half of the dough over the filling and press the edges together,
crimping with your fingertips. Set 2 calzones on each baking sheet.
Brush the tops with the olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the calzones until nicely browned, about 12 to 15 minutes.
Serve hot or warm.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: A few years ago you published a recipe for a delicious
tortilla soup. Can you please print it again?</LD>
<LD>   FERN M. STEINER</LD>
<LD>   San Diego</LD>
<TE>   DEAR FERN: Is this it? It's from Mayi Brady in the Times Test
Kitchen and was one of our best recipes in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Tortilla Soup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   2 onions, sliced</TE>
<TE>   6 cloves garlic, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 ear corn, husk and silk removed</TE>
<TE>   1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</TE>
<TE>   1 chipotle chile packed in adobo sauce, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   4 (14 1/2-ounce) cans vegetable broth</TE>
<TE>   1 avocado</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound Jack cheese, grated</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   1 cup tortilla strips</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add the
onions and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add the garlic, lower the heat
to medium-low and continue cooking, covered, 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   While the onions and garlic cook, roast the corn in a dry skillet
over high heat until slightly charred, turning so it does not burn,
about 5 minutes. Cut the kernels from the cob and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Add the tomato paste and chipotle to the onions and cook over
medium-high heat, stirring, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vegetable broth
and bring to boil. Simmer 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   While the soup simmers, chop the avocado.</TE>
<TE>   Puree the soup in a blender in small batches, returning each batch
to the pan and combining well.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the cheese, avocado, cilantro, corn and tortilla strips
among 4 bowls and ladle the soup over the top.</TE>

<HD>Tripe: Do You Have the Stomach for It?</HD>
<DH>Loving the meat that no one else will mention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For all the talk about how food can bring us together, it can divide
as well. There are dishes that polarize. Take tripe.</LD>
<LD>   It is standard equipment on every cow that ever produced a T-bone
and has been pleasurably eaten for centuries, at least. But if an
indiscreet tripe lover should happen to mention his predilection in
the company of those who do not share it, the mildest reaction will
be cruel mockery. More likely is a look of abject horror, as if he
had just admitted to taking part in some of the less savory rituals
of a Black Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Even though they must keep their affections secret, there is a
group of tripe lovers out there, and there are chefs who cater to
them with more than a steaming bowl of menudo. You're most likely to
find this offal brotherhood in restaurants that specialize in more
informal fare, French bistros and Italian osterias.</LD>
<TE>   "We have people who call to see when we will have tripe, and
they'll reserve two portions for that night and then two portions to
take home for later," says Gino Angelini, chef at the justly
celebrated Angelini Osteria on Beverly Boulevard, near La Brea
Avenue. "My customers really seem to love this."</TE>
<TE>   Tripe is always served as a special at Angelini Osteria. "Tuesday
is my day of tripe," he says. "I can't have it on the regular menu
because sometimes I can't find the tripe and then people get mad when
it's not there."</TE>
<TE>   Tripe is the stomach of a ruminant--any cud-chewing hoofed animal
with an even number of toes and a multi-chambered stomach. In this
country, that almost always means a cow, but you will sometimes see
lamb tripe and veal tripe at specialty butchers. Chitterlings, the
offal choice of the South, comes from the corresponding parts of
pigs, so it is not really tripe, pigs not being ruminants.</TE>
<TE>   Since cows have more than one stomach, there is more than one kind
of tripe. Three are commonly eaten, and they differ mainly in
texture. Honeycomb is the most common type of tripe; you'll know it
by its pronounced diamond pattern of hollows and ridges. Book tripe
is also found in some markets. It gets its name because its ridges
lie in straight lines, like the pages of a riffled book. Least common
is plain old tripe--the main stomach. It looks slightly furry, like a
sheared sheepskin seat cover.</TE>
<TE>   In French, these cuts are called, respectively, caillette,
feuillet or bonnet and pance. The same bits in Italian are reticolo,
centopelle and rumine. Those names are primarily of academic
interest--you'll only need them if you're working from an
untranslated recipe. Of more practical use are the names in Spanish,
since it's at Mexican markets that you're likely to have the best
luck finding different varieties of tripe. At Economy Meats in Grand
Central Market in downtown Los Angeles, honeycomb tripe is sold as
casita, book tripe is libro and the big, shaggy stomach is panza.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it's called, tripe is pretty tough stuff. Generally, the
more work a muscle does, the more cooking it will take to become
tender. And what does more work than a cow's stomach? Plan on
braising any tripe dish at least a couple of hours. The good news is,
it's almost impossible to overcook. Really good tripe has the soft
texture of well-washed silk.</TE>
<TE>   At this point it should also be noted that really good tripe does
not smell overly "tripe-y." Rather, there should be just a hint of
stink--like putti, those angels painted on the ceiling of Roman
churches: heavenly forms with earthy faces. You can also think of it
as being akin to certain great Burgundies, where a bit of a
"barnyard" aroma mingles with a silky texture in such a way that it
is regarded as a complexity rather than a fault.</TE>
<TE>   There's more good news. In the old days, tripe required much more
cooking than it does today, as well as elaborate preparations before
you could even put it in the pot. Almost all the tripe you'll find in
markets today has already been bleached with lime and precooked. The
smell should be fairly mild, though there may be a faintly uric tinge
(whether this comes from the animal or the chemicals used in
preparation is hard to say).</TE>
<TE>   Tripe purists sniff at this new cleaned-up convenience. In "Simple
French Food," Richard Olney calls it "emasculated."</TE>
<TE>   Angelini, on the other hand, remembers the bad old days, when
housewives had to do their own bleaching. "It does change the taste
to make it in a factory, but you used to be able to tell who ate a
lot of tripe at home by the women with scars on their hands. It's
dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Though the preparation of tripe may have been done by housewives,
the eating of it carries distinctly masculine overtones. Tripe, like
many other strong-flavored foods, carries with it a tradition of a
certain hardy bonhomie.</TE>
<TE>   Angelini started serving tripe when he was the last chef at the
late, great Italian luxe restaurant Rex. He'd cook up a batch from
time to time to serve to friends when they came into the restaurant.
"I thought no one in this country would eat it," he says. "But
whenever I sent some out, other people in the dining room would start
to order it too."</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Pierre Bosc, chef at the bistro Mimosa and at Cafe des
Artistes in West Hollywood, remembers eating tripe when he was
growing up in France.</TE>
<TE>   "My father always cooked tripe for his friends on Sunday
mornings," he says. "He didn't really cook very much, but there were
a few special dishes he did, and one of them was tripe. This was a
real dish for the guys. He'd invite 10 friends, and when they got
there, he'd put a big pot of tripe in the middle of the table with
several bottles of white wine and a big piece of cheese.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very French way to do brunch."</TE>
<TE>   At Mimosa, Bosc has a hard time selling tripe but runs it as a
special from time to time: the famous tripes a la mode de Caen
(braised with cider and Calvados), or the Lyonnais specialty tablier
de sapeur, which is like silk handkerchiefs that have been breaded
and deep-fried.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we do for ourselves," he says. "Even though it's
not a big seller, Mimosa is a bistro, and tripe is a part of who we
are."</TE>
<TE>   Angelini Osteria, 7313 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (323) 297-0070.</TE>
<TE>   Mimosa, 8009 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (323) 655-8895.</TE>
<TE>   Tablier du Sapeur</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 40 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 4  1/2
hours plus overnight marinating</TE>
<TE>   The name of this Lyonnaise classic translates as "Fireman's
Apron." Whatever. This is how Jean-Pierre Bosc prepares it at Mimosa,
and it is a dish to convert even tripe-haters. If you can find the
whole stomach, use that instead of the honeycomb. Bosc prefers
Japanese "panko" bread crumbs. Be aware that the dish must be started
at least one day in advance. Serve this with lemon wedges and tartar
sauce, or a sauce gribiche.</TE>
<TE>   3 pounds honeycomb tripe</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 carrot, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 stalks celery, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 leek, white and light green parts only, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 bay leaves</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig thyme</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup strong Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   5 eggs</TE>
<TE>   4 cups fresh bread crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup oil</TE>
<TE>   Rinse the tripe, place it in a large saucepan and cover it with
water. Add 1 tablespoon of salt and bring to a boil. Immediately
remove the tripe from the water and rinse it under cold water. Remove
any large chunks of fat.</TE>
<TE>   Return the tripe to the saucepan, cover generously with more cold
water, add 1 teaspoon of salt, the onion, carrot, celery, leek, bay
leaves, thyme and black peppercorns. Bring to a simmer and cook very
slowly until tender, about 31/2 hours. Cover and refrigerate in the
cooking broth until cool.</TE>
<TE>   Drain the tripe and cut it into 4-inch triangles. Combine the wine
and the mustard and coat both sides of each piece of tripe with the
mixture. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Before serving, remove the tripe from the marinade and remove any
excess marinade.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the eggs with 2 tablespoons of water and a dash of salt.
Mound the bread crumbs in a shallow container.</TE>
<TE>   Dip each triangle in the egg mixture and then in the bread crumbs,
pressing both sides to make sure the tripe is heavily coated with a
firm breading. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high
heat until quite hot. Add the tripe and cook about 4 to 5 minutes a
side until well-browned. Drain on paper towels. This may need to be
done in 2 or 3 batches. Add more oil as needed.</TE>

<TE>   Trippa alla Gino</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 35 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 4 hours</TE>
<TE>   This is how Gino Angelini fixes tripe at Angelini Osteria. Note
the addition of the wine corks, which he insists make the tripe
smoother and silkier.</TE>
<TE>   3 pounds honeycomb tripe</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 (2-ounce) chunk prosciutto fat</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, unpeeled</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig fresh sage</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   2 whole cloves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup finely diced carrot</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup finely diced celery</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup finely diced onions</TE>
<TE>   2 wine corks</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   1 (1-ounce) piece Parmigiano-Reggiano</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced shallot</TE>
<TE>   1 cup tomato puree</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sparkling water</TE>
<TE>   5 sprigs parsley, minced</TE>
<TE>   Rinse the tripe well and cut it in thin shreds, about 1/4-inch
thick. It's easiest to do this with the smooth side up.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat along with
the prosciutto fat and the garlic. Tightly tie the sage, rosemary and
cloves in a cheesecloth bundle and add it to the pan. Add the carrot,
celery and onions. Cook until the vegetables are soft and just
beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the shredded tripe, the wine corks and the red pepper flakes
and continue cooking. After about 10 minutes the tripe will be
swimming in moisture. Add the chunk of cheese and the shallot and
cook until that moisture has reduced to an almost sauce-like
consistency, about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the tomato puree and cook another 10 minutes. Add the
sparkling water and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until the
tripe is quite tender and the moisture has reduced to a sauce-like
consistency, thick enough that the shreds of tripe cling to each
other, about 3 hours. If the tripe starts to dry out, add more tomato
puree and sparkling water, up to 1 cup of each.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the piece of prosciutto fat, wine corks, cheese chunk and
garlic, sprinkle with parsley and serve.</TE>

<HD>The Quieter Pleasures of San Marino</HD>
<DH>Hipsters need not apply, but there's good food for those
who take the time.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Marino will never be considered cutting edge, and that's just
fine with the people who live there. It's a wealthy area, and it
seems that most of that money is as old as the towering trees that
line the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Roots run deep too. People who grow up in San Marino tend to
return here to raise families of their own.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than being trendy, places in San Marino have a quiet charm.
On Huntington Drive near San Marino City Hall, the blocks are long
but there is plenty of shade. The shops along here haven't changed
much in the last 30 years. The proprietors know their customers well.
There's no hard sell.</LD>
<TE>   The nights are quiet, dull by some standards. There are no bars or
dance clubs, no movie theaters or bowling alleys, no neon signs or
banners. The businesses are not allowed to remain open past 10 p.m.
without a permit, and those are hard to come by.</TE>
<TE>   But if a simple meal, a little quiet shopping and a nice long walk
sound good, Huntington Drive between Bedford Road and Del Mar Avenue
is just the place for you.</TE>
<TE>   1. The Fresh Gourmet. The Olivas family owns this snug little
place. The aroma of the soup cooking in the back is delicious as you
walk in and are greeted by Norma or her daughter Nikky. They do most
of the cooking from scratch. Nikky bakes the bread for the
sandwiches. The salads are big, and the ingredients are really fresh.
They make the soup daily. You can choose ham, turkey, roast beef,
chicken, tuna or egg salad sandwiches served on a variety of fresh
bread, with fruit and a homemade cookie. Take it to the park.</TE>
<TE>   The Fresh Gourmet, 2004 Huntington Drive. (626) 308-1720. 11 a.m.
to 4 p.m., 5 to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Saturday</TE>
<TE>   2. Sushi Bar Yoshida. Though this is primarily a sushi bar, it
also has seven or eight tables. There is usually a wait for these, so
phone ahead and reserve a seat. There's a very extensive sushi menu,
and the chefs seem to know most of the people at the counter and are
helpful in deciding what their customers might like. Also on the menu
are a couple of Chinese appetizers--pot stickers and shiu mai
dumplings--and other traditional Japanese dishes. The lobster tempura
makes a great appetizer.</TE>
<TE>   Sushi Bar Yoshida, 2026 Huntington Drive. (626) 281-9292. 5 to
9:45 p.m. Monday through Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   3. San Marino Hardware. For 40 years San Marino matrons have been
coming to this hardware store for silver polish. That's the No. 1
seller, followed only by lavender sachets with mothballs. But this
place could put some of the trendiest kitchen stores to shame. You
may have to dig around a little, but you'll find all sorts of mixing
bowls: glass, copper and stainless steel. There are lots of utensils,
stacks of linen dish towels and beautiful tablecloths. They also
carry dinnerware: Wilton Armetale and Portmeirion. And there's lots
of Pyrex and Emile Henri for the microwave-to-table-to-refrigerator
crowd. There are Henckel knives and Chantal cookware, cast-iron
skillets and a huge variety of colorful bowls. They also carry small
appliances. There are several sizes of walnut, beechwood or maple
salad bowls. And of course hammers, nails and screwdrivers. Whatever,
Carol or Gregg Minoux, the owners, will steer you to the right aisle.</TE>
<TE>   San Marino Hardware, 2134 Huntington Drive. (626) 282-6536. 9 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   4. San Marino Stationers and Party Shop. This party store is,
well, sedate. They have a nice selection of Caspari, Gibson Creative
Paper and Amscan paper goods. "We don't carry a lot of what I call
the Westside patterns," says the owner, Barbara Allison. "We have the
more traditional floral designs and colors." There's a section of
party favors for kids, with hats and horns, confetti and balloons,
bubbles, card tricks, plastic teeth and fire hats, and lots of fake
money.</TE>
<TE>   San Marino Stationers and Party Shop, 2140 Huntington Drive. (626)
289-9661. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   5. For Goodness Sake. This is a vitamin store and sandwich shop,
with an extensive candy counter. It's also the only place in town
that sells lottery tickets. Judith Waring owns this shop with her
sister Carol Giddings. Originally from Essex, England, they also
carry a small selection of English groceries: Typhoo and Quick
English tea, Bird's sherry trifle mix, shepherd's pie mix, Heinz
baked beans, Robinson's Barley Water, Hob-Nobs and various English
jams. "This area reminds me of a small English village," says Waring.
"We know everybody that comes in and what they're likely to buy." The
place is full of kids after school. They sit at the tables and do
their homework and have a smoothie or a sandwich--and candy, of
course.</TE>
<TE>   For Goodness Sake, 2150 Huntington Drive. (626) 943-9618. 9:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   6. Wine Connections. Proprietor Alan Chen is not much for warm
greetings, but the mustard-colored walls and the smell of pine from
the wine crates in this small, well-chosen wine store are welcoming
enough. It's not a huge space, so the wine inventory is manageable
and not overwhelming. There are a few expensive, first-growth
Bordeaux: Margaux, Latour, Mouton-Rothschild and Haut Brion. And Chen
also carries a selection of high-end California wines.</TE>
<TE>   Wine Connections, 2154 Huntington Drive. (626) 289-1066. 10:30
a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   7. San Marino Grill. In 1966, the year it opened, grills like this
were everywhere. Their menus were largely identical: hefty breakfasts
served with a bottomless coffee cup, grilled sandwiches and burgers,
milkshakes and homemade pie. Not much has changed here, from the red
leatherette booths to the daily special (lamb shanks with mashed
potatoes). Have a short stack, eggs and bacon over the morning paper.
It's also one of the only places in town that is allowed to have
newspaper racks on the sidewalk out front.</TE>
<TE>   San Marino Grill, 2494 Huntington Drive. (626) 286-2500. 7 a.m. to
3 p.m. Monday through Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   8. Mijas. This restaurant is also owned by the Olivas family from
the Fresh Gourmet. Whenever they made Mexican food at that
restaurant, they sold out immediately, so they started this one.
Everything here is homemade except the tortillas. They sell a lot of
soft tacos served with rice, beans and salsa. Ask for some guacamole.
It's good.</TE>
<TE>   Mijas, 2506 Huntington Drive. (626) 287-1021. 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Tuesday through Friday; 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   9. Tony's Pizza. It opened in 1973, and the pizza is still good.
"It's an old secret recipe," says Vincent Croce, preoccupied with
tossing dough in the air. The place is full of teenagers eating
mostly pepperoni pizza. After work, men still in their ties dash in
and grab a pie to go, and the phone doesn't stop ringing. If you
happen to live in San Marino, they'll deliver. Otherwise call ahead
and pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   Tony's Pizza, 2555 Huntington Drive. (626) 793-4114. 10 a.m. to 9
p.m. Monday through Thursday; 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Chardonnay Breaks the Butterscotch Barrier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I used to be a staunch ABC man. "Anything But Chardonnay" (and
Cabernet) was my motto. I was simply bored with the sameness of the
oak-flavored grape syrups so many California vintners were producing
from the state's two predominant varieties.</LD>
<LD>   But as a confirmed evolutionist, I've taken delight in observing
the California wine industry's rapid progress toward lofty goals.
Well, relatively rapid, given that changes in vineyards and wineries
take years to show up in wines. The leading-edge producers are intent
on wines that express the nature of a place, sometimes called
terroir.</LD>
<LD>   First, Napa Valley producers got the quality of their Cabernets
dialed in through the 1990s. Today the world's outstanding wines
consistently include Napa Valley Cabernets. This does not necessarily
include the over-hyped and overproduced cult Cabs, but their rising
tide has lifted all producers.</LD>
<TE>   And recent vintages provide ample evidence that Chardonnay
producers in several regions are hitting a similar stride.</TE>
<TE>   In Burgundy, they say the Chardonnay vine is an instrument for
extracting character from the soil. The idea is that the nuances of
Chardonnay wine can be an acute reflection of where the vines grow.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, regional expression and its rarer subset, site-specific
expression, are easily obscured by winemaking techniques. Countless
market surveys and focus groups have told Chardonnay producers that
most consumers want luscious, buttery, oak-flavored wines. Since
Chardonnay is not born tasting oaky and buttery, winemakers have
responded by going heavy on new oak barrels (and oak chips too) while
taking malolactic fermentation beyond its acid-softening effect into
the realm of oily texture and butterscotch flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Both winemaking tools are useful in shaping the sensory profile of
wine, but their overuse leads to increasing homogenization by working
against the expression of regional character. On the other hand, as
viticultural practices improve the ripeness and concentration of
grapes in favored vineyards, the sensory resemblances of wines from
certain places inevitably become more apparent. California wine
observers began to see that kind of distinction in wines from the
Carneros district during the mid-1980s. Now it's widely accepted that
Carneros Chardonnays typically show a high-toned but rich lemon
character, often compared to lemon cream or custard, along with
bright, focused fruit flavors with a citrus core.</TE>
<TE>   Winemaker Steve McRostie's Chardonnays are good examples. They
come from several vineyards in the heart of the Carneros American
Viticultural Area, or AVA, where a chilly breeze comes whistling off
nearby San Francisco Bay most afternoons. The wind has a dramatic
effect on temperatures in the area, pulling the mercury down as much
as 10 degrees on a summer afternoon.The net effect is a prolonged
growing season. Even though the vines start their spring growth a
week or two earlier than in most areas, the Carneros harvest is
usually a week or two later. That extra time on the vine deepens
flavor intensity and complexity.</TE>
<TE>   "When I smell Carneros I know it," says McRostie. "It's spicy,
with lemon and sometimes lime. I don't see as much brightness in the
aroma of southern Napa, and Russian River Valley Chardonnays tend to
be more tropical." McRostie says he wants Carneros fruit to be the
centerpiece of his Chardonnays, so he keeps his winemaking as
unobtrusive as possible. For example, although the wines are
barrel-fermented, he limits his use of new oak and malolactic
fermentation.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the barrel to be there as an interesting sidelight,
noticed but not front and center," he says. "I don't want it to
overwhelm the wine. And I like the acidity Carneros gives us, but I
want the wines to be enjoyable when they're consumed, so we do
malolactic to achieve that. But I don't want that to show in a strong
butterscotch quality."</TE>
<TE>   In Anderson Valley, on the ocean-cooled side of Mendocino County,
Navarro Vineyards winemaker Jim Klein uses similarly non-intrusive
winemaking to preserve the regional character of Navarro's "Premier
Reserve" Chardonnay. The wine comes primarily from 25-year-old vines
on the Navarro estate in the cool "Deep End" of Anderson Valley,
where succulent lemon and deeper sweet pear flavors typical of
Anderson Valley Chardonnay develop late in the season along with high
acidity, particularly from malic acid. Klein feels that malolactic
fermentation is necessary to bring the acidity into balance, but he
wants to avoid the strong buttery character that can obscure the full
range of fruit expression.</TE>
<TE>   And here's where climate plays an unexpected role in winemaking.
The Deep End is the coolest, most marine-influenced zone in the
valley, with afternoon sea breezes; temperatures rarely get above the
high 80s. "In late September, when they're well into harvesting in
Sonoma and Napa, we're waiting for ripeness," says Klein. "We get
such a late start on fermentation, and it goes so slowly, that the
wines never complete malolactic until April. I used to worry about
that, but now I think it actually improves the fruit character. The
fruit stays bright and we don't get that butterscotch flavor."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most exciting stories in the evolution of California
wine has been the increasingly detailed sensory mapping of western
Sonoma County through wines--largely through Chardonnay. Two smaller
areas within the Russian River Valley, Green Valley and the western
coastal ridges, have become increasingly distinct.</TE>
<TE>   Chardonnays from the partnership of grower Steve Dutton and
winemaker Dan Goldfield are vivid expressions of fruit from the cold,
foggy heart of the Russian River Valley. They come from several
Dutton Ranch vineyards within the Green Valley AVA (which lies within
the Russian River Valley AVA) and reflect the distinctively steely,
citrus-zest character of that ocean-cooled enclave.</TE>
<TE>   The vineyards include some of the oldest Chardonnay vines in
Sonoma County, planted in 1969 by Warren Dutton (Steve's father), and
the unique Rued Vineyard, planted in 1972 with a Muscat-like
Chardonnay selection that shows an exotic, tropical fruit-like
character.</TE>
<TE>   "For me it all comes back to those unique vineyards and older
plantings," says Goldfield. "A lot of people say Chardonnay is a
winemaker wine. But I think of it as a vineyard wine, and I think it
shows regional 'typicity' better than almost any other variety."</TE>
<TE>   Hartford Court's "Seascape Vineyard" Chardonnay is an outstanding
example of another emerging area, the high-altitude coastal margin of
Sonoma County that has begun to consistently yield Chardonnays with a
kind of sea-breeze character similar to Anderson Valley's.</TE>
<TE>   Its keen citrus and mineral aroma, sleek but powerful palate and
succulent lemon-candy finish all say something about a long, cool
growing season above the fog line, where the unblinking solar
intensity is moderated by bracing winds off the nearby Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   So does the firm, fine-grained texture, which Hartford Court
winemaker Mike Sullivan feels is a signal quality of extreme coastal
fruit. "It's an interesting thing about Sonoma Coast Chardonnay,"
Sullivan observes. "You don't get the same exposure as farther
inland, so the sun isn't burning the tannin out of the fruit."</TE>
<TE>   These are just a few examples of Chardonnay's ascendancy. As more
winemakers lighten up on technique and let the fruit shine through,
Robert Louis Stevenson's famous 19th century observation about Napa
Valley becomes more universal: "The smack of California earth shall
linger on the palate of your grandson."</TE>

<DH>2000 Jermann Vintage Tunina Venezia-Giulia, Friuli, Italy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vintage Tunina was the first real luxury cuvee to come out of the
Friuli region of northeast Italy. Created by Silvio Jermann, whose
estate was founded by his grandfather Antonio in 1881, it celebrates
its 15th anniversary with this vintage. It's quite a wine, opulent
and full-bodied, scented with ripe melon and pears, and a whiff of
vanilla. The blend--Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc with some Ribolla
Gialla, Malvasia and a little of Friuli's indigenous Picolit
grape--has character and finesse and is decidedly food-friendly. It's
a particularly good match with Chinese dishes.</LD>
<LD>   About $42. Available at Wally's, (310) 475-0606, and The Wine
House, (310) 479-3731, in West Los Angeles; Woodland Hills Wine Co.
in Woodland Hills, (818) 222-1111; Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa
Mesa, (949) 650-8463; Wine Exchange in Orange, (714) 974-1454; Lazy
Acres Market in Santa Barbara, (805) 564-4410; and Wine Bank in San
Diego, (619) 234-7487. If you can't find this wine, have your local
wine shop contact the distributor, Wine Warehouse, (800) 331-2829.</LD>

<LD>What kind of scandal is it, this crash and collateral carnage of the
highfliers?</LD>
<LD>   Considering the epoch in which we live, it's probably no surprise
that right and wrong winds up as just another banality to argue
about.</LD>
<LD>   What kind of scandal is Enron or Global Crossing? Relax, some of
the don't-worry, be-happy free-market extremists tell us. We must
accept that some innocents are going to get trampled by the great
march of growth and competition. By this reasoning, we have the
isolated scandal of only a couple of businesses. Or even more
narrowly, a few renegade bad boys inside these companies. Merely some
flamboyant white-collar crime, so take a pill.</LD>
<TE>   These ideologues want to contain damage on the political front
too. Because both parties are dirty with campaign contributions and
cozy friendships, it cannot be a political scandal, see? No need to
get riled up. That bipartisan face on our government investigations
is proof that all we need are a few hundred more confusing pages to
the accounting laws and maybe the ritual sacrifice of a stray
accountant or two.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense. This is no time for soothing. We should be biting down
on raw habaneros, not Prozac.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and Global Crossing are extremes, we hope. But they are more
than that, even if some don't care to say so. They are signposts for
a society in danger of losing its way.</TE>
<TE>   By nature and by experience, I am not a believer in conspiracy
theory--not orchestrated conspiracies. But sometimes our national
mood amounts to the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   In a Roper poll last month, only 76% of Americans said it was
wrong to cheat on their taxes, meaning that 24% figure it's OK.
That's an 11% increase in potential scofflaws in just two years. With
that many Americans believing it's OK to cook their own books, what's
the shock if companies do the same?</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, two of our nation's most prominent historians,
Stephen Ambrose and Doris Kearns Goodwin, have been caught
plagiarizing. Oops, just mistakes, they said. As with Enron, the
truth is buried in the footnotes, eh?</TE>
<TE>   This year, in its annual survey of the nation's college freshmen,
UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute found that time spent
studying had reached a record low and grades had reached a record
high. Meanwhile, 73% of students want to be affluent. The poll didn't
ask, but I'll bet a record number of these students also would rather
not have to pay for their music libraries but just steal them off the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of scandal has engulfed us? A scandal of direction. Of
misplaced ideals for what defines progress and success.</TE>
<TE>   "So great and rapid has been our material growth that there has
been a tendency to lag behind in spiritual and moral growth," said
Teddy Roosevelt, who saw it coming in 1908.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and Global Crossing, or for that matter Ambrose and Goodwin,
or Napster and tax cheating are what happens when shortcuts become
society's thoroughfares.</TE>
<TE>   Those who cannot see the connections, those who say that our
values are fine and that we have to expect a little mischief once in
a while as the price of doing business, those who tell us not to lose
our perspective are the ones who have lost theirs. We don't need
voices of calm. We need thunder. Bring it on. A political scandal?
Let's hope so. A scandal of free-market idolatry? Why of course. A
class scandal in which the rich have become looters? Bang the drum.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't become inconsolable just because life is
incomprehensible," counsels the poet Jim Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   With Enron and Global Crossing we know that a few insiders
pocketed millions of dollars, tens of millions and sometimes hundreds
of millions of dollars at the expense of thousands of trusting
workers and a nation of investors. Lesser outrages are disclosed
almost weekly, all with the same grim point: You are either a
hammerhead or baitfish. Didn't Kmart just offer an $11.5-million
bonus package to keep the CEO who led it into bankruptcy?</TE>
<TE>   We shouldn't sit still for it. Whether it is paying taxes, writing
history or dealing in commerce, there is right and wrong. Nothing
should obscure that. And we should not acquiesce to those who counsel
that life isn't that simple. Yes it is. Or should be. Wrong deserves
no apologists, explainers or excuse makers.</TE>

<HD>Land for Peace Is a Losing Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK J. GAFFNEY JR.</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the past week, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince
Abdullah, has received kudos in Washington, Arab capitals and
diplomatic circles around the world for what is characterized as a
"new peace initiative" to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Unfortunately, this characterization is so wildly inaccurate as to
appear a deliberate fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called Abdullah plan--Arabs would normalize relations with
Israel in exchange for the Jewish state surrendering the territory
seized after 1967's Six-Day War--is not "new" in any meaningful
sense.</LD>
<LD>   The idea of Israel giving up the land it conquered in the course
of successive wars waged against it in exchange for a genuine peace
with the Arabs has been around at least since the last of those wars
ended in 1973. Various U.N. resolutions, numerous shuttle diplomacy
missions and the Oslo process have all been predicated on the
land-for-peace proposition. Time after time, Israel has agreed to
territorial concessions. The resulting dismal experience with each of
these ventures has, however, made most Israelis reluctant to buy into
such a shopworn idea yet again.</LD>
<TE>   Even if the Abdullah plan were a genuinely new concept, it would
not be conducive to a lasting peace. Over the past 30 years, Israeli
governments of the right and left have recognized that areas of the
West Bank have been essential to persuading the Arabs that the "war
option" is foreclosed. Should strategic Israeli positions on the high
ground above the Jordan Valley, many of which are secured by
settlements and military outposts, be surrendered, the Arabs'
calculus surely would change.</TE>
<TE>   And despite the interest expressed by President Bush this week,
the Abdullah plan cannot accurately be called an "initiative" either.
The Saudi king-in-waiting apparently has not decided to formally
introduce his plan at an upcoming Arab League summit. There also have
been differing reports of the plan's particulars.</TE>
<TE>   The real impetus behind the Abdullah plan seems to be a cynical
bid to divert increasingly critical American attention from the Saudi
kingdom's double game. The Saudis have been portrayed as one of the
United States' most reliable allies in the region. At the same time,
the royal family has patronized Wahhabism, the virulently radical
strain of Islam that has brought the world Osama bin Laden and his Al
Qaeda terrorist cells, most of the Sept. 11 hijackers and a worldwide
network of madrasas, or religious schools, busily indoctrinating
young Muslims to hate and attack Western infidels. It also has become
clear that Saudi Arabia is perfectly willing from time to time to
increase oil prices at the expense of world economies and to impose
restrictions on U.S. use of Saudi bases.</TE>
<TE>   In the months since Sept. 11, a growing chorus on Capitol Hill, in
the press and even in some quarters of the Bush administration, has
shown that American patience with the Saudis is wearing thin. One
suspects that Abdullah saw the need for a "charm offensive" in the
form of a new peace initiative for the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Israel has no good options at the moment. The same
applies to the U.S., as one of Israel's few friends and its principal
ally. Among the worst of the available options, though, would be for
either Israel or the U.S. to embrace a warmed-over--and thoroughly
discredited--effort to strip the Jewish state of land it requires for
its own defense.</TE>
<TE>   There can be no guarantees that despotically governed Arab
states--especially Saudi Arabia--would live up to their part of the
bargain any more than they have in the past. Even if today's rulers
promise to do so, their successors cannot be relied upon to follow
suit.</TE>
<TE>   There is much that Saudi Arabia can and should do, from opening up
its bases to a needed U.S.-led effort to end Saddam Hussein's
misrule, to shutting down its madrasas, to providing humanitarian
relief and job opportunities to Palestinians whom their Arab brothers
see fit to keep rotting in refugee centers.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the Abdullah plan goes, though, the American and Israeli
response should be the same: "Thanks, but no, thanks."</TE>

<HD>Riordan Can Learn From the Mormons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY LAWRENCE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the neck-and-neck battle for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has followed the
conventional wisdom of so-called moderate Republicans that the GOP
must be more inclusive. If you ease up on the strong planks in the
platform, the thinking goes, the voters will come.</LD>
<LD>   The Mormon Church has proved just the opposite. Mormons have
discovered that you gain adherents by standing for something, not by
watering down your beliefs. An organization never gains support by
compromising its values. What might appear appealing in the short run
has disastrous consequences. Just ask mainline Protestant religions.
Since the social upheavals of the 1960s, they have focused less on
their doctrines and more on being popular.</LD>
<LD>   In many churches, it is rare to hear a heartfelt exposition of the
basic tenets of Christianity: the divinity of Christ, his literal
resurrection, his atoning sacrifice, his imminent return, life after
death. Ministers have substituted a feel-good theology, focusing on
the outward expressions of Christianity, such as compassion, but
failing to defend its causes. And what has been the result? Falling
membership.</LD>
<TE>   Mormons have what is probably the strictest set of beliefs and
practices of any major religion. They don't back off one inch about
the divinity of Christ as the literal son of God. The resurrection is
an absolute. Life after death is an absolute. Atonement is an
absolute. Same with their daily practices: no tobacco, no alcohol.
Tithe the full 10%, even for members in Third World countries.
Mormons stick with their principles.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they are experiencing explosive growth. Their president has
said the church's No. 1 problem is how to handle it. How many
churches can say that?</TE>
<TE>   Growth in religion and in political parties comes from clarifying
principles, not from diluting them. Riordan doesn't seem to
understand that. Take his effort to replace the pro-life plank in the
GOP platform, where he has succumbed to the false dichotomy of life
versus choice.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans are neither pure pro-choice (abortion for any
reason) nor pure pro-life (no abortions, no exceptions). Most can see
that life and choice are not mutually exclusive. Every woman has the
right to choose what she will do with her body. And where there was
no choice (rape, incest) or when there is no choice (danger to the
life of the mother), abortion is her option. But as most women
seeking abortions seem to have forgotten and as Jesse Jackson said,
albeit early in his career, the choice happens the night before, not
the morning after.</TE>
<TE>   That is clarification without compromise. That explanation, rooted
in the principle of defending innocent life, will attract adherents.
Wimping out and playing "me too" among a chattering pro-choice
movement that avoids responsibility for its actions will not.</TE>
<TE>   Inclusiveness does not mean trying to be all things to all people.
Successful inclusiveness means inviting like-minded people to find a
home for their beliefs with us; finding those voters who believe in
such Republican principles as defending life, reducing government,
building a strong defense, solving problems at the local level, using
marketplace mechanisms wherever possible, strengthening families,
letting wage earners keep more of their earnings and having faith in
our fellow citizens to make decisions without big government looking
over their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan should take a page from the Mormons. The Republican Party
will grow by standing firm, not by going wobbly with
lowest-common-denominator appeals. Mushing up Republican principles
will not persuade Democrats to switch. It will only repulse them.</TE>

<HD>Enron's Watkins Falls Far Short of Being a Hero</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA PEENO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems that we have learned nothing about courage or heroes since
Sept. 11. The firefighters, police officers, airline passengers and
other ordinary people who risked their own lives and lost their lives
for others are heroes.</LD>
<LD>   But those words have nothing to do with the actions of Enron Vice
President Sherron S. Watkins.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Watkins is being heralded as a courageous hero for a memo that
became public only because of the disaster she predicted. Likewise,
we have learned nothing about whistle-blowers--people who risk
everything by taking public some malfeasance--if we use that term to
describe Watkins. It is a perverse culture of business ethics that
allows an individual to be described as courageous or a
whistle-blower just because she took bad news to a boss.</LD>
<TE>   Language is critical, not just for the ethical concepts but also
for the message that we send about certain kinds of behavior. As a
senior executive of a company, as an accountant, Watkins wrote a memo
detailing her concerns. She was simply doing her job.</TE>
<TE>   She did not go to the board of directors, she did not seek outside
assistance, she did not resign, she did not go public. She risked
nothing. In fact, she sold some of her Enron stock while making her
allegations. She locked up her incriminating files. Real courage,
real heroism and real whistle-blowing would have resulted in an
unrelenting pursuit of her concerns, regardless of the risks to
herself.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Louis Brandeis once said that sunlight was the best
disinfectant. We need to foster a culture of increased transparency
to ensure that powerful corporations do not trample law, ethics and
public responsibility in the interests of financial gain. Rays of
light occur only when we hear the voices willing to speak out from
tightly sealed walls. Yet whistle-blowers often suffer job loss,
personal retaliation and broken lives.</TE>
<TE>   We need ways to identify, reward and encourage moral courage. In
"The Mystery of Courage," William Ian Miller writes that moral
courage differs from physical courage in that it is "lonely courage."
It requires "making a stand, calling attention to yourself or running
the risk of being singled out in an unpleasant and painful way." It
depends on "the capacity to overcome the fear of shame and
humiliation in order to admit one's mistakes, to confess a wrong, to
reject evil conformity, to denounce injustice and also to defy
immoral or imprudent orders." Although moral courage does not
necessarily require physical courage, Miller says that it can be
undone by physical cowardice.</TE>
<TE>   When Watkins wrote her memo, she had the potential for a great act
of moral courage, but in the end it was undone by her physical
cowardice. We call her courageous now only because the rest of the
lot is so vile. We call her a whistle-blower because she started to
do something the others did not do at all.</TE>
<TE>   We should use Watkins as a case study of the power a single person
could have if she were willing to risk everything for a higher
principle. It is the power we as a society can have if we protect the
real heroes--those with moral courage and physical courage who may
suffer for their heroism.</TE>

<HD>Sayonara to a Novel Path to English?</HD>
<DH>At Roosevelt High, Japanese language teacher believes his
classes help many immigrant students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hajimemashite, dozo yoroshiku," William Adams enunciates for his
introductory Japanese language class at Roosevelt High School on Los
Angeles' Eastside. "That basically means, what's up," he says,
eliciting laughs from the room of freshmen and sophomores.</LD>
<LD>   Then he gives a somewhat philosophical translation,
explaining that Japanese culture is very formal: "Let's begin a new
friendship."</LD>
<LD>   Adams asks the students to repeat the phrase. Hands on hips, he
listens. One by one, he calls on them by their last names, with the
Japanese honorific added: "Gutierrez-san," "Ruvalcaba-san." After a
few tries, he's satisfied with their pronunciation.</LD>
<TE>   Amid the Japanese phrases, the other languages heard in the room
are a mixture of Spanish and English. For most of Adams' students,
Spanish is their first language.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, Adams has been teaching Japanese at Roosevelt, the
largely Latino campus that enrolls many immigrant students. With 300
students over four levels taught by Adams and another teacher, it is
the largest high school Japanese program in the state, according to
the California Language Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Adams fears that an upcoming Los Angeles Unified
School District policy change will reduce the number of potential
students for Japanese classes.</TE>
<TE>   Many people are daunted by Japanese, especially learning to read
and write hiragana, katakana and kanji--its three writing systems.
But most of Adams' students say they are not intimidated, partly
because of his rigorous but encouraging lessons and the kinship they
find Japanese bears to Spanish through similar vowel sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Many in Adams' classes could have glided through Spanish as an
elective, but they have opted to broaden their knowledge. Sophomore
Jessica Rocha said Japanese will help her get ahead as a
businesswoman someday.</TE>
<TE>   However, some of Adams' students still struggle with English and,
while linguists might suggest those students should focus on learning
English, Adams believes studying another language helps.</TE>
<TE>   "Studying Japanese helps clarify English constructs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert B. Kaplan, emeritus professor of linguistics at USC,
disagrees. "The grammar of Japanese is so different from the grammar
of English, I can't imagine how learning Japanese would help you
learn English," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Students struggling with English would be better served learning
English before taking on a third language, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And that philosophy is being adopted by L.A. Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Starting next school year, the pool of students for Adams' classes
and all other foreign languages will be reduced under a new policy
that will require ninth-graders identified as having problems with
English and reading to be in a remedial class for two periods a day.
That will leave no time for such electives as Japanese. The district
has yet to decide whether the double periods will extend into other
grade levels.</TE>
<TE>   Adams estimates that 45 to 50 of his current 60 first-year
students would have been affected if the plan had been in place this
school year.</TE>
<TE>   He fears that not taking a foreign language will hinder students
from getting into college. Cal State schools expect students to take
at least one year of foreign language. The UC system looks for three
years, as do many private colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Jennifer Peraza said she feels more comfortable speaking
Spanish than English. Her parents are from Guadalajara and speak
little English. Yet, she said that "Japanese is my easiest class."</TE>
<TE>   Adams is afraid that next year's freshmen may suffer by not
starting foreign languages their first year.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Ephraim, L.A. Unified's assistant superintendent of
instruction, defended the new remedial policy for students whose
grasp of English needs improvement. "If they can't read a social
studies book, having Japanese won't get them into a UC school
either," she said. And if they improve their English, they can still
finish three years of a foreign language, starting as sophomores.</TE>
<TE>   A former English teacher himself, Adams, 59, knows how important
it is to improve English literacy, but he learned firsthand the value
of a foreign language. A self-described Army brat, Adams lived in
Japan when he was 8. He went to high school in Hawaii, living among
many Japanese Americans. He majored in English literature at UCLA,
and became an English teacher at Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   The school was interested in teaching Japanese because of Japan's
influence as an international economic power. Adams started the
Japanese class at Roosevelt in 1982 with 15 students, about half of
them Japanese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt's neighborhood, Boyle Heights, had long had a mixed
population of Japanese, Jewish and Russian immigrants because it was
one of the few areas that didn't have racial deed restrictions.
Little Tokyo is a short jaunt away.</TE>
<TE>   But today, none of the students taught by Adams and Keiko Miya,
hired six years ago, is of Japanese ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Ramirez, a Roosevelt senior, said Japanese comes easily for
her. "With French, you have to use a certain accent, but with
Japanese, you already have that because of Spanish," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Ramirez began studying the language three years ago, friends
told her she wouldn't have much use for it. But she believes having a
grasp of three languages will help her as a doctor someday.</TE>
<TE>   Only four other L.A. Unified high schools offer
Japanese--Narbonne, Gardena, Venice and Bell.</TE>
<TE>   As at Roosevelt, the majority of the students in Japanese classes
at Bell High speak Spanish as their first language.</TE>
<TE>   "Our students are atypical of students studying Japanese," said
Tim Mathos, Bell's Japanese teacher. "Traditionally, people who take
Japanese are straight-A students from wealthy neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Mathos agreed with Adams that learning a foreign language should
be an option for even those freshmen struggling with English. "To
teach Japanese, I don't need their English or Spanish skills," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gary Idama, Gardena High School's Japanese language
teacher, agrees with the district policy, even though his
English-as-a-second-language students do well in his class.</TE>
<TE>   "If their English is not up to par by the time they leave high
school, they're not going to college right away," Idama said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that debate, Adams is determined to let students know how
foreign languages can help them explore the world beyond Boyle
Heights. He and a group of students are in the midst of raising funds
for a trip later this year to Tokyo, Kyoto and Hiroshima.</TE>
<TE>   "Gambatte," he often tells his students in Japanese. "Try hard and
hang in there.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a strong enough will, you can overcome anything."</TE>

<LD>For all his hardships, Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez caught
a lucky break once he reached U.S. shores. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, feeling the political weight of Florida's
Cuban Americans, took pains to ensure the boy's well-being while
warring factions battled over him in court.</LD>
<LD>   Edwin Munoz is a far more typical example of what happens to young
people who arrive in this country illegally. Munoz's parents
abandoned him in his native Honduras before he was 7. A cousin who
was supposed to care for him beat him with a wet rope, scarring his
chest and arms. Seven years later, having walked and hitchhiked to
the United States, the frightened boy was caught by the INS and held
in a juvenile jail in San Diego for six months with violent
criminals.</LD>
<LD>   Last year there were more than 4,000 children under INS custody,
many of them having fled such evils as child prostitution, bonded
labor, forced recruitment as soldiers or female genital mutilation.
The INS slammed almost half of them behind bars. Imagine the
confusion of a child who after perhaps taking courage and comfort
from images of Lady Liberty finds himself locked up with  gangbangers
and carjackers.</LD>
<TE>   No asylum seeker should be subject to this kind of treatment,
least of all a child. The fastest way to remedy this form of child
abuse is to expedite a bill introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) that aims to ensure good treatment for unaccompanied
children in the custody of the U.S. government. The Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee on Immigration will hold a hearing on the issue
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, the INS is responsible for the apprehension,
detention and deportation of unaccompanied children. In addition, the
INS is in charge of their care, placement and legal protection. These
are conflicting responsibilities. Feinstein's legislation would
establish an Office of Children's Services within the Department of
Justice to take care of the children, leaving the enforcement part to
the INS.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would also establish minimum standards for detention,
custody and release of children to make sure they are detained at
appropriate facilities. It would provide minors access to legal
counsel and a guardian to protect their rights and, when suitable,
strive for family reunification or other alternative placement. This
is the least a nation of immigrants can do for these vulnerable
aspirants to the American dream.</TE>

<LD>In two days of testimony earlier this month, Judge Charles Pickering
made clearer than ever why the Senate Judiciary Committee should
block his elevation to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. One
question remains. After poring over Pickering's record and grilling
him during the hearing, will the senators who pronounced themselves
"troubled" match their rhetoric with the "no" votes this nomination
deserves?</LD>
<LD>   Responding to sometimes testy questions from committee members,
Pickering tried but failed to justify two glaring ethical lapses:
Why, as a judge, did he have a forbidden conversation with
prosecutors in 1994 to get a reduced sentence for a convicted cross
burner, and why, in recent months, did he lean on lawyers who have
appeared before him to write letters supporting his nomination?</LD>
<LD>   Senators also took Pickering back over now-familiar ground: his
court decisions that reveal his predisposition to disbelieve claims
of racial discrimination, sexual harassment and voting rights
violations, and his outspoken and unrelenting opposition as a
Mississippi state senator to abortion, except to save the pregnant
woman's life.</LD>
<TE>   Pickering's answers didn't help his case, and since the hearing
some Democratic committee members have announced their intention to
vote against his nomination, probably next month. Democrats hold a
10-9 majority on the committee. But as opposition to Pickering
mounts, so does the ire of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott, who has
vowed that his friend and fellow Mississippian will be confirmed "or
else."</TE>
<TE>   Lott insists that this confirmation fight is about churlish
Democrats who, by imposing litmus tests on judicial nominees, seek to
deny a Republican president his prerogative to make appointments.
It's not. It's about a nominee whose past actions and judicial record
amply show him to be at odds with the principles of fairness,
independence and equal opportunity that guide our courts and our
nation.</TE>
<TE>   If Democrats sink Pickering's nomination in committee, Lott is
reportedly considering asking the full Senate for a "motion to
discharge" the nomination from the Judiciary Committee, clearing the
way for a vote on the floor that he is likely to win. The use of such
a motion would be unprecedented in a judicial nomination fight, not
to mention a baldfaced affront to the integrity of the Senate's
committee structure.</TE>
<TE>   If Republicans mean what they say about wanting to avoid a
polarizing contest, President Bush should withdraw Pickering's
nomination. If Lott's pigheadedness pushes the matter to a final
battle on the floor, responsible senators must vote no.</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't come to that. The Constitution's drafters meant the
Senate to be a check on the president, and the confirmation process a
way to ensure that federal judgeship nominations are more than just
payback for political favors. That means when a nominee isn't up to
the job--and Pickering isn't--senators on the Judiciary Committee
must reject him or her no matter the arm-twisting, no matter the
menacing threats of retribution.</TE>

<LD>Campaign finance reform scored a historic victory two weeks ago when
the House of Representatives approved the Shays-Meehan bill banning
soft money, but new dangers lurk in the Senate. Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle had promised to bring Shays-Meehan to the floor as
quickly as possible, but the pace has already slowed as the Senate
takes up the energy bill. He and other supporters need to make sure
that campaign reform doesn't lose momentum and is passed immediately.</LD>
<LD>   As public outrage over the Enron scandal shows, voters want
drastic changes in a political system that has almost become a blind
trust for corporate interests. And they want them now. Soft money
contributions, which have allowed both political parties to raise
unregulated and unlimited amounts for blatant attack ads that appear
in the guise of issue advertising, came to almost $500 million in the
last election. Enron's individual, political action committee and
soft money contributions totaled $2.4 million. Shays-Meehan would
prohibit political parties from collecting soft money.</LD>
<TE>   Now that the Enron controversy has pushed campaign reform over the
top in the House, Daschle needs to give it one last boost. The
Democrat is right to try to work with Republican senators to ensure
their cooperation, but he shouldn't become bogged down in protracted
negotiations. Some Republicans have threatened to stymie the reform
bill by loading it up with amendments that would send it straight
back into the unfriendly arms of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert. The
GOP leader has admitted that he views this legislation as
"Armageddon."</TE>
<TE>   GOP foes of Shays-Meehan--including Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.),
one of the most strident opponents of campaign reform--appeared
Tuesday to be backing away from their earlier threats to block the
legislation through a filibuster. That's encouraging. Sen. Gordon
Smith (R-Ore.), an opponent of the bill, has indicated that he may
vote against any filibuster attempt. Smith has it right: "We've
debated it long enough."</TE>
<TE>   Foes of reform are on the defensive for now. They are pinning
their hopes on a possible court challenge that would argue that
banning soft money suppresses free speech. But how the courts will
react to campaign finance reform cannot be predicted. It may well
survive any challenges. But it won't get to that stage unless the
Senate passes Shays-Meehan and sends it directly to President Bush.
Now is not the time to falter. It is the moment for finally getting
reform passed.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Plan Calls for Increase in Oil Production," Feb. 24:
Politics continue to hide the larger picture associated with drilling
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: the people. The Gwich'in
Indians still practice a traditional lifestyle of hunting and
fishing, and to this day caribou are the most important food source
for them. It is a part of who they are. Environmental standards are
very different for proponents of development than for those who have
no vested economic interest in exploiting the oil.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to ask President Bush about the number of oil spills
we know about and their effects on our fragile northern ecosystem.
Who will explain to the children yet unborn why the world we have
left them is so damaged and will remain so for centuries? How so
little oil in the ground was worth so much that we allowed one of the
last wild places on Earth to be destroyed? We should be concentrating
most on conservation and working to integrate alternatives to burning
fossil fuels into our lives instead of pursuing this destructive
path. It isn't just land and animals in jeopardy, it's a culture.</LD>
<LD>   Andrea McNeill</LD>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I opened Sunday's Times to read of the Bush plan to drill in the
Arctic refuge to increase oil production. Later, I read in our local
paper that our president is calling for a reevaluation of land space
presently set aside for an endangered bird, the California
gnatcatcher. Still later, I switched on C-SPAN and heard Nevada Gov.
Kenny Guinn (a Republican) as he spoke of how upset Nevadans were
about the Bush plan to send nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain, about
150 miles from populated areas. Apparently the government has not
bothered to file an environmental impact report for this tremendous
undertaking. Nevada is suing the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   One wonders if the commander in chief isn't using his wartime
status to achieve domestic ends.</TE>
<TE>   Sydell Stokes</TE>
<TE>   Valencia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In your article our options for an energy policy are presented as
more production versus conservation. And conservation is limited to
more-efficient refrigerators and fuel-efficiency requirements on
SUVs. Why is there no discussion of the benefits of smart growth and
a federal role in encouraging it?</TE>
<TE>   If, instead of low-density sprawl that can never be served
efficiently or effectively by transit, new development simply had a
commercial core surrounded by concentric circles of housing with
ever-lower densities, we would achieve significant savings in terms
of oil use. And we would still be providing a wide range of housing
options. On the other hand, if we force every household to have two
or three cars to survive, we are going to get the resulting
pollution, traffic congestion and growing dependence on imported oil.
(We've gotta face it that the OPEC nations have oil reserves that
dwarf what is left in the U.S. and Canada.)</TE>

<LD>Re "No Wonder Women Feel They Must Have Face Lifts," Commentary, Feb.
22: Not every woman over 50 feels she has to lift anything! Spewing
nonsense like "aging women are among the least powerful segments of
the population" adds to the myth that fuels society into thinking
that what you look like is all that matters.</LD>
<LD>   The commentary goes on: "Female disintegration from the inside out
was long considered a normal part of aging." Aging isn't a crime, but
society certainly tries to make it one. You can't run and you can't
hide from the process of aging; however, you can choose to accept it,
cover it up, lift it, stretch it or tie it in one big knot.</LD>
<LD>   All individuals should be able to feel comfortable in their own
skin no matter where it's hanging. My proud 83-year-old mother is
beautiful and says she earned all those years and cherishes them and
her wonderful life. She is proud to show them off--a work in
progress--and I think she is very wise, something else we all hope to
achieve in the aging process--wisdom.</LD>

<LD>Re "Afghans Selling All They Can Sell," Feb. 25: The global crusade
against terrorism launched with such flag-waving fervor after Sept.
11 has bogged down in the Afghan quagmire, as critics of the war
policy hesitantly predicted at the time. Now what? Build an Afghan
national army of 25,000 to 75,000 troops out of the ragtag soldiers
and their rival warlords who switch sides for the cost of a U.S.
government-issue sleeping bag or a set of camouflage fatigues in
plentiful supply at the bazaar in Mazar-i-Sharif?</LD>
<LD>   Combat terrorism? Of course we must, but with real consultation,
full agreement and the total involvement of the U.N. and our allies.
And while we're at it, maybe it's time to tackle that thorny
question: What breeds terrorists and why do so many people around the
world hate the U.S.? And where is Osama bin Laden anyway?</LD>

<TE>   Your detailed "outing" of Afghan anti-Taliban spies really scrapes
the bottom of the ethical barrel ("These Spies Called the Shots in
Strikes Against Taliban," Feb. 24). And complete with photos and
family connections--gross! How will you feel when you learn that
these people have been "eliminated," thanks to your gratuitous
publicity?</TE>

<LD>"A Fellow May Squirm a Bit in a Chair Endowed by Ken Lay" (Feb. 24)
reminded me of a morality play. It has the elements of
"rationalization," "the end justifies the means" and "every man has
his price." I am not qualified to judge whether the good that these
educators do for society through the endowments is greater than the
harm that was done to those who lost their life savings. I do believe
that those quoted in the article who discounted or whitewashed the
behavior and unethical creative business practices of Enron's and
Arthur Andersen's key leaders rationalized that the endowment money
wasn't tainted--and they are shameless.</LD>
<LD>   Am I holier than thou? That's a good question that others will
have to decide. I do feel comfortable that my middle-class lifestyle
was not derived at the expense of many thousands of others whose
lifestyles were trashed.</LD>

<TE>   I'm sick to death of your articles and letters to the editor
criticizing Kenneth Lay. The man is a true American patriot, an
American hero, being given a bad rap. The executives of Enron
followed the laws as set forth by Congress. They observed all the
regulations and accounting practices required. Each day we read of
another corporation that followed the same procedures. We all know
that the executives of Enron will never be convicted of any violation
of the law. I'm sorry that so much money was lost, but anyone who
invests in stocks must be prepared to lose it all or stay out of the
stock market.</TE>

<LD>Every time a convicted murderer faces the death penalty (usually
after 10 to 20 years), the press revives the pros and cons of the
issue. The reality is that we have almost abolished capital
punishment in the United States. In California, over 600 juries have
sent over 600 convicted murderers to death row in the past 25 years.
In that time only a little more than 5% of those convicts actually
were executed.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve states have banned capital punishment. Federal death
sentences have been carried out twice in 34 years. The remaining 38
states (except Florida, Texas and Virginia) rarely execute any death
row inmates. Though I believe many murderers deserve to be executed,
the facts show that the delays, attitudes and laws are shifting to
ban capital punishment in this century.</LD>

<HD>Self-Inflicted Wounds Hurt Music Industry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Grammys Find Sales in a Funk," Feb. 24: As your article points
out, today's music industry is suffering. Unfortunately, it is
suffering mostly from self-inflicted wounds. Record company
executives seem concerned solely with signing the mega-superstars who
can deliver the next blockbuster album. Motivated more by dollar
signs than music, some of these recording artists seem to have
forgotten to include the "art" in their albums. Creativity,
imagination and passion for music take a back seat to figuring out
how to appeal to the broadest cross-section of the public.</LD>
<LD>   Executives have remained mired in a late 20th century model of
distribution in which they alone control access to music. Trying to
extend that control into the 21st century, they are now pursuing copy
protection schemes which dictate to fans when and where and on what
devices we can listen to the music we've purchased.</LD>
<LD>   The one bright spot in this clouded musical landscape is that
digital technology is now giving some measure of control back to the
artists. New technologies make recording and producing music easier
than ever before, and the Internet makes possible low-cost
distribution directly to the fan. Perhaps in this way musicians who
still have a passion for music will be able to connect with music
lovers with a passion for music.</LD>
<TE>   David Salahi</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Geffen asks: "Where are this generation's Bruce Springsteen,
Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, the Beatles--who are they today?" Hard to
have sympathy for an industry that refuses to listen to music not
delivered by an agent or lawyer. It's called rejecting "unsolicited"
material. The justification is that it's impossible to sift through
the thousands of tapes and CDs routinely submitted. Yeah, it's got to
be difficult listening to music eight hours a day. And who out there
would do it for the minimum wage? Boo hoo.</TE>

<HD>School 'Vouchers' Need a Name Change</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I guess "school vouchers" need a new name. Do you remember the GI
Bill, where veterans could get a grant or a loan to go to any school
they wanted--University of California, Brigham Young or an aircraft
maintenance school? It didn't make any difference if it was a public
school, a religious school or a private trade school. The same goes
for federal Pell grants--public or religious--no difference.</LD>
<LD>   Now when we want to give the kids school vouchers to enable them
to go to a school of their choice, people go bonkers--using
government money to go to a religious school! How dare they? I think
it is the public schools' administrations and teachers who are
fighting so hard to stop this. It would encroach on their territory.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe school vouchers should be called "choice grants" and people
would not be so against them. If the grants were available, I think
it would amaze you how many private secular schools would sprout up
to take care of the kids who wanted to use them.</LD>

<LD>The Transportation Security Administration has ordered the
elimination of VIP lines at U.S. airports (Feb. 21). The bureaucrats
have it all wrong once again. I travel for pleasure two to three
times per year. I have a relative who travels on business at least 10
times more often. It makes perfect sense to allow the frequent-flying
business traveler to get special treatment. I may be flying on a $300
ticket while the business flyer could easily be paying $1,200 for the
same flight.</LD>
<LD>   It really doesn't make any difference to me if it takes a couple
of hours to check in on a vacation flight; however, those same two
hours can be critical to the business flyer. We need to get our
economy and the airlines going again. This ridiculous ruling will
have the opposite effect.</LD>

<HD>Dick Kleiner, 80; Broadway and Hollywood Columnist,
Biographer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dick Kleiner, a veteran Broadway and then Hollywood columnist,
syndicated to as many as 600 newspapers for 55 years, and an author
and celebrity biographer, has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Kleiner died Feb. 13 at his home in San Juan Capistrano, said his
son, Peter. The writer, who underwent quintuple bypass heart surgery
more than a decade ago, suffered from diabetes and had been on
dialysis for several years.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, Richard Arthur Kleiner was the son of the late Israel
S. Kleiner, a biochemist and professor who in 1915 as a Rockefeller
Institute researcher co-discovered the cause of diabetes. Pinning the
disease on inadequate function of the pancreas releasing too much
sugar into the blood paved the way for the 1921 discovery of insulin
to treat diabetes by Frederick Banting and Charles H. Best.</LD>
<TE>   Kleiner learned, after finding a yellowed scrapbook in the attic
of the family home, of his father's scientific involvement with the
disease about the same time he was told he had it, he wrote for
Diabetes Forecast magazine in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me the gift of life twice," Kleiner wrote in the unusual
personal article, "once as a father and once as a scientist."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Rutgers University with a degree in
journalism, Kleiner served in the Army Signal Corps during World War
II, helping to break Japanese codes. At war's end, he signed on with
the Newspaper Enterprise Assn., at the time the world's largest news
feature service.</TE>
<TE>   After a few years in its Cleveland bureau, he transferred to New
York and soon became an expert in Broadway theater and those who
peopled it. He wrote articles and a column on the Great White Way for
some 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, Kleiner moved to Los Angeles to cover Hollywood. Over the
next quarter-century, he interviewed--by his own count--more than
8,000 stars and hopefuls, and covered on-the-set production of dozens
of motion pictures and television shows.</TE>
<TE>   He also began doing book-length profiles of several of the
Hollywood glitterati, either with or without their cooperation. Among
his books are "The Ghost Who Danced With Kim Novak and Other True
Tales of the Supernatural" (1969); "E.S.P. and the Stars" (1970);
"Mervyn Leroy: Take One" (1974); "The Two of Us," with Tony Martin
and Cyd Charisse, (1976); and "Please Don't Shoot My Dog: The
Autobiography of Jackie Cooper" (1981).</TE>
<TE>   Kleiner also wrote such varied volumes as "Index of Initials and
Acronyms," "Hollywood's Greatest Love Stories" and a children's book,
"The World's Worst Wisher." He contributed hundreds of articles to
magazines in addition to his syndicated newspaper stories and,
according to his son, wrote lyrics for several songs, including "Say
Hey, the Willie Mays Song."</TE>
<TE>   Even when Kleiner "retired" in 1989, the syndicate he had served
for more than four decades could not let him go. He continued his
popular question-and-answer column, "Ask Dick Kleiner," which he
started in 1975, three times a week until December.</TE>
<TE>   Carried by the entertainment sections of smaller newspapers in the
United States, the Bahamas and Canada, the column covered questions
about Hollywood trivia, such as: "I remember a quote that was
attributed to a famous actor, 'The trouble with the world is that
it's always one drink behind.' For the life of me, I can't remember
who said it. Can you help?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Kleiner could help. The pithy remark, he wrote, came
from Humphrey Bogart.</TE>
<TE>   Kleiner said he wrote his column on a computer on his bedroom desk
and that he selected letters--choosing "a good geographic
distribution" and a mix of queries about movies and television--from
the 150 to 200 he received each week.</TE>
<TE>   Each answer, he said, was carefully researched in his home
reference library or by calling his considerable entertainment
business contacts. Despite his vast experience over the years, he
said, "I don't like to trust writing off the top of my head."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Kleiner is survived by his wife of 47
years, journalist Hortensia "Chicki" Kleiner, who often assisted him
with his column in recent years; two daughters, Cindy Smetana and
Katherine Winovich; and five grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>Frank Quinn Brown, a longtime photographer with the Los Angeles
Times, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Brown died Feb. 16 at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla of
complications from pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Salt Lake City, where as a boy he delivered newspapers
on horseback, Brown came to California in the late 1930s and found
work in a camera store before joining The Times in 1942.</LD>
<TE>   As a staff photographer, he covered fires and parades, sporting
events and such Hollywood celebrities as Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable
and Mae West, as well as U.S. presidents, including Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon and Harry S. Truman.</TE>
<TE>   One of his more memorable photographs, colleagues recalled, was
taken in the aftermath of a gangland shooting in the early 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   It showed a waitress in a bowling alley stepping over a body while
carrying a tray of drinks. Although The Times didn't publish the
picture, it was later picked up by Life magazine, which gave it
prominent play.</TE>
<TE>   Often working with Charles Hillinger, a roving feature writer on
the staff, Brown took cruise liners to Hawaii for a series of stories
on the voyages and spent time on the islands doing feature stories
well before Hawaii became a state.</TE>
<TE>   He also photographed Alaska in the days it fought becoming a state
and the Galapagos Islands in 1960, when an unemployed Seattle tugboat
operator tried to start an American colony.</TE>
<TE>   The eclectic Brown played piano, was a tournament contender in
tennis and golf, and designed and built two of his own homes--the
first in the Mt. Washington area, where he used adobe because he
could not get lumber for the wartime construction, and the second a
retirement home in La Jolla after he left The Times in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Gethine; and a sister,
Gladys Boyle of Oakland.</TE>

<HD>W. Heebner, 84; Revived Music of Piano Greats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Heebner, a veteran record producer who gave new life to a
series of unique early 20th-century piano-roll recordings that
captured the nuances of original performances by Paderewski, Mahler,
Debussy, Ravel and other legendary pianists and composers, has died.
He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Heebner, a Studio City resident who also produced western
bandleader Spade Cooley's popular show on KTLA-TV in the early 1950s,
died of cancer Feb. 10 in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   As a versatile recording director for RCA Victor and Capitol in
the '40s and '50s, Heebner produced artists such as Leopold Stokowsky
and Spike Jones. He also recorded Mario Lanza, Tony Martin, Andre
Previn, Jascha Heifetz, Frank Sinatra, Shirley Temple, Tommy Dorsey,
Roy Rogers, the Count Basie Orchestra, Desi Arnaz and many others.</LD>
<TE>   But it was his transferring to stereo analog the master tapes of
some 500 vintage classical music piano rolls of 1905-20--"The Welte
Legacy of Piano Treasures"--in the 1960s that Heebner considered his
major artistic contribution to music.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine sitting in the room listening to Debussy playing Debussy
or Ravel playing Ravel. That's what it was like listening to Welte
piano rolls played by a Vorsetzer, a squat, 700-pound machine with 88
felt-covered, human-sized "fingers" and felt-covered "feet."</TE>
<TE>   Literally translated from the German as a "before-sitter," the
Vorsetzer would be placed in front of a grand piano and, guided by
electronic impulses, play the piano rolls. But unlike player pianos,
which roll out only note for note, a Vorsetzer played back the music
with the same emotion, dynamics and shading of the artist who
originally played it.</TE>
<TE>   That was made possible by the first step in the recording system
perfected in 1904 by Edwin Welte of the German firm M. Welte &amp; Sohne.</TE>
<TE>   The great pianists Welte invited to play sat at a special grand
piano equipped with carbon rods that extended downward from each key.
When the keys were struck, the rods dipped into a trough of mercury
and completed an electric circuit that controlled the pressure of an
inked rubber wheel turning against a roll of thin paper.</TE>
<TE>   If the pianist struck a key softly, the wheel marked the paper
faintly. If a key was struck forcefully, the rod sank deeper into the
mercury and intensified the current.</TE>
<TE>   When the rolls were played back on a piano by the companion
Vorsetzer machine, listeners not only heard the music but the
personality of the original performance. Indeed, when the widow of
Italian virtuoso Ferruccio Busoni heard one of the Welte rolls a few
months after her husband's death, she is said to have run from the
music salon screaming, "Ferruccio! Ferruccio!"</TE>
<TE>   Before phonographs supplanted the demand for Welte's Vorsetzer, he
had recorded performances of more than 100 pianists and composers.</TE>
<TE>   By World War II, however, the Welte legacy was largely forgotten.
But in 1948, an American named Richard Simonton acquired a set of
master rolls that had been hidden in a cave during the war.</TE>
<TE>   Early attempts to make modern recordings of the Welte rolls never
quite met contemporary sound standards. Then, in 1962, Simonton
turned the historic rolls over to Heebner.</TE>
<TE>   Heebner played the rolls back on a modern Steinway--the same
concert grand piano used in recording sessions by Arthur
Rubenstein--in an acoustically ideal studio with seven sensitive
microphones. The resulting sound was better than even Welte could
have imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "Those recordings are every bit as good as they might have been
had the masters themselves been around to play for the Stereo Age,"
Time magazine wrote in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember we'd be sitting in the recording studio and you'd
swear it was a human being in there playing," recalled Heebner's
daughter Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Heebner produced more than 50 Welte piano roll albums, which were
released through his Recorded Treasures company.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Wissinoming, Pa., in 1917, Heebner began studying the
saxophone and voice at age 9. By 13, he was donning a tuxedo and
playing in a ballroom orchestra three nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated with honors from Temple University in 1938 and
studied pre-law at the University of Pennsylvania. But he had
continued playing music throughout school, and music won out over a
career in law.</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, while continuing to play clarinet and saxophone in
various society orchestras, he landed a job in sales at RCA Victor in
New York. While in the Army during World War II, he produced V-Disc
recordings in New York for the armed services. And after the war, he
returned to RCA, which sent him to Hollywood as its Artist and
Repertoire director.</TE>
<TE>   He left RCA in 1950 to produce "The Spade Cooley Show," which was
broadcast live from a ballroom on the Santa Monica Pier. But after
three years, he missed the recording business and returned to New
York, where he started Capitol Records' Custom Division.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, he created a Q-Music Library for Capitol, an eight-hour
repertoire of musical cues that is still in use today in radio,
television and film.</TE>
<TE>   Heebner also wrote the words and music for 20 songs, including
"Purple Islands" and "Eternally," which were recorded in the '50s.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter Mary of Santa Barbara, Heebner is
survived by his wife of 52 years, Claire; three other daughters,
Dorothy Patrick of Chatsworth, Lesa Heebner of Del Mar and Toni
Heebner of Sherman Oaks; and four grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Julius Viel, 84, former Nazi SS commander convicted last year of
murdering seven Jewish prisoners during World War II, died of lung
cancer Monday in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.</LD>
<LD>   A court concluded in April 2001 that Viel shot inmates from the
Theresienstadt concentration camp near Prague in Nazi-occupied
Czechoslovakia in the spring of 1945 when he was a second lieutenant
in the German special police.</LD>
<LD>   Viel acted "out of lust for murder and base motives" and not on
orders, the court in Ravensburg ruled.</LD>
<TE>   Viel, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison, claimed that he had
helped oversee a group of prisoners digging an anti-tank trap in the
area but had not been there when the killings took place.</TE>
<TE>   The retired journalist was tried only after a former Nazi officer
trainee came forward to say he personally saw Viel seize a rifle and
shoot the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Viel, who was appealing his case, was released from prison earlier
this month because of deteriorating health.</TE>

<HD>Two Unions Jump Into Fight Against Prop. 42</HD>
<DH>Politics: Teachers and service employees launch a late ad
campaign to thwart widely supported effort to dedicate state gas tax
to transportation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Two of the state's most powerful unions are pouring money into a
last-minute campaign to defeat Proposition 42, the March ballot
measure that would earmark state gasoline sales taxes for
transportation projects.</LD>
<LD>   In a surprise attack, the California Teachers Assn. and the
Service Employees International Union began airing television
commercials around the state Tuesday opposing the measure. They
contend that Proposition 42 would hurt schools and public health and
safety by dedicating the 6% sales tax to transportation instead of
spending it on a variety of services through the general fund.</LD>
<LD>   Gale Kaufman, a political consultant for the opponents, said the
unions decided to mount a campaign late last week after two
newspapers editorialized against Proposition 42.</LD>
<TE>   Union officials also thought that pro-42 commercials were
confusing, and determined that the ballot measure was "eminently
beatable," Kaufman said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that the CTA and SEIU are footing the bill for the ads,
but declined to say how much they plan to spend. Representatives of
each organization did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   By mounting an opposition campaign, the unions risk the ire of
political heavyweights just months before the CTA mounts a separate
campaign for a massive school construction bond.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 42 is supported by Gov. Gray Davis, the California
Chamber of Commerce, a variety of tax watchdog groups and
transportation advocates. Lawmakers placed it on the ballot on a
bipartisan vote.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a classic act of subterfuge," said Scott Macdonald, a
spokesman for the Yes on Proposition 42 campaign. "Here they come in
at the end dumping money into political advertising that I'm sure
will be riddled with half-truths and scare tactics."</TE>
<TE>   David Ackerman, a lobbyist for the Associated General Contractors
and the California Chamber of Commerce, said he is confident his side
will prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "Our message is strong and true," Ackerman said. "Proposition 42
refocuses money into a critical area of the California economy and
does it without raising taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents, who have collected about $5 million, contend that
California's roads are the worst in the nation and that most
motorists assume the gas sales tax already goes to transportation.
Approving Proposition 42, they add, would improve public safety by
relieving congested roads.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition's television ads represent an abrupt turnabout.
Kaufman recently told The Times that the CTA had decided not to mount
a campaign because it was saving its money for the November school
construction bond. But on Tuesday, Kaufman took issue with the fact
that Proposition 42 would embed transportation funding into the state
Constitution, making it a higher priority than other issues.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, the CTA benefits from Proposition 98,
the 1988 measure that requires that about 35% of the state's general
fund be spent on kindergarten through community college education.</TE>
<TE>   At risk for teachers are billions of dollars that the governor and
Legislature can direct toward schools beyond the funds guaranteed by
Proposition 98.</TE>
<TE>   About $31.4 billion from the general fund is earmarked for
education in Davis' 2002-03 budget proposal. By comparison,
Proposition 42 would shift an estimated $1.4 billion to
transportation starting in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a little hypocrisy when the education community wants to
constitutionally protect school funding and then we run out and
oppose the effort by the advocates of other vital services who want
to do the same," said Kevin Gordon, executive director of the
California Assn. of School Business Officials. Gordon's group has
taken a neutral position on Proposition 42.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman also criticized supporters of Proposition 42 for failing
to point out in their television ads that the measure would not take
effect until 2008. Under current law, gas sales taxes collected from
July 2003 through June 2008 are earmarked for a specific plan to
relieve urban traffic congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 42 would permanently dedicate those taxes to
transportation projects, beginning in July 2008.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Alice Wallace, 77, a model and "Goldwyn Girl" who appeared in
glamorous films of the 1940s and on the covers of major magazines and
in commercials, died of emphysema Saturday in Sherman Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   As a UCLA student, she began modeling and joined Sam Goldwyn's
bevy of "Goldwyn Girls," starring in such films as the 1944 "Up in
Arms."</LD>
<LD>   Her motion pictures typecast her in the role of show girl or
fashion model.</LD>
<TE>   Her films included "Show Business," "Till the Clouds Roll By," "A
Song Is Born" and "The Girl From Jones Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace moved to New York in 1949 and flourished as a highly paid
Powers model.</TE>
<TE>   But the work eventually proved her physical undoing when she posed
for a cigarette commercial for television and became a heavy smoker.</TE>
<TE>   She was diagnosed with emphysema in 1992, gave up her 38-year
smoking habit and participated in experiments to treat the disease.</TE>
<TE>   After her modeling career ended, she devoted herself to family and
charities.</TE>

<HD>CHP Brass Lead Big-Rig Sweep</HD>
<DH>Highways: Strike force of 150 officers targets dangerous
truckers in predawn crackdown. Trade group supports the action as a
key step in improving safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Highway Patrol deployed a strike force of 150 officers, including
the chief and other top brass from its headquarters, in a predawn
crackdown Tuesday on dangerous truck drivers.</LD>
<LD>   The unannounced action marked the second time in seven months that
the CHP has targeted truckers for special attention in a campaign to
reduce the stubborn toll of truck crashes that kill and injure
Californians.</LD>
<LD>   The sweep occurred on roadways throughout Northern California, but
was concentrated most heavily in the Bay Area and Sacramento. Similar
enforcement actions are expected soon in Southern California,
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is our highest priority," CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike"
Helmick said as his top executives and about 50 rank and file
officers in Sacramento climbed into fleets of black and white
cruisers, special white truck chasers, airplanes and pickup trucks.
Another 70 participated in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   By midday, the CHP said officers in the Sacramento region had
issued 246 tickets for moving violations, including 147 for speeding
and 89 for mechanical problems. Twenty-four trucks were immediately
grounded for safety reasons. Verbal warnings were given to 110
drivers. In the Bay Area, officers wrote 223 citations, but did not
break down categories of violations.</TE>
<TE>   The sweeps have been supported by the California Trucking Assn., a
trade group that represents 2,500 truck companies, as an important
step in improving the safety of truck operators and other motorists.</TE>
<TE>   The first daylong crackdown against errant big-rig operators was
launched statewide in June and involved about 1,500 officers. But it
did not include road patrols by executives from the CHP headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting his top deputies from their desks to behind-the-wheel
patrols, Helmick said, was intended to demonstrate the CHP's
commitment to making California highways safer.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, truckers were found at fault in the deaths of 134 people
and in the injuries of another 6,280, according to CHP records.
During the first six months of last year--the latest period for which
figures were available--truck drivers were at fault in the deaths of
60 people and injuries to 2,834 others.</TE>
<TE>   Trucks were involved in 412 highway deaths in 2000, records show,
and were involved in injuries to 12,896 people. In the first six
months of 2001, trucks were involved in 187 deaths and 6,189
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick riled truckers earlier this month when he denounced unsafe
truck operators as life-threatening "clowns." He said he made a
distinction between these and what he described as the "vast
majority" of responsible drivers. On Tuesday, he told his officers
that he was "getting beat up quite badly" by trucking industry
publications, which criticized his "clown" remark.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick said he was especially disturbed by a major collision on
Interstate 5 near Sacramento during December in which a young couple
and their infant daughter were killed in a crash with a truck. "There
is absolutely no reason for this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the officers fanned out, some of Helmick's executives, most of
them up-from-the-ranks officers, encountered surprises.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, an irate truck driver, who had just been stopped for
speeding on California Highway 50 east of the capital, swung down
from his cab and charged at Valley Division Assistant Chief John
Rolin and his partner, Sgt. Matt Polanco. "He was screaming mad about
being pulled over," Rolin said.</TE>
<TE>   Rolin, who has not been on a road patrol for about 10 years, said
he and Polanco tensed up for a potential fight with the 6-foot,
250-pound trucker, but Polanco managed to calm him without incident.
The man accepted his ticket, apologized and walked away, criticizing
his own stupidity.</TE>
<TE>   Along a stretch of Interstate 5 south of Sacramento, the site of
some of the state's worst truck-involved accidents, Helmick and
Officer Kedren Emery pulled over a speeding 18-wheeler that was
hauling a load of lumber in commuter traffic.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the driver fumbled in the cab in an apparent attempt to
hide a speeding ticket that had been issued to him 11 days earlier at
virtually the same spot in the same truck, Helmick said. Then he
handed the citation to the commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to cost him a couple hundred dollars," Helmick
said. "The message isn't getting through."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Emery and Helmick stopped a new compact car for failing to
display a temporary registration document. The driver, Sheila
Holloman of Stockton, seemed stunned at being stopped but eager to
get on her way.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick let her go with a warning, but asked where she was headed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to Sacramento to take my peace officer test," Holloman
told the commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   She asked for help in locating the examination site. Helmick gave
her directions and wished her well in a law enforcement career.</TE>

<HD>Eviction of 400 Families Delayed</HD>
<DH>Court: Sacramento judge schedules hearing on the dispute
with a Japanese billionaire, who wants to sell the homes.Sacramento
area tenants of a Japanese billionaire who wants to sell their homes
win a temporary reprieve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>More than 400 suburban families facing eviction from their rental
homes here by a Japanese billionaire won at least a temporary
reprieve in court Tuesday after their attorneys argued that the
looming mass uprooting could create a public nuisance.</LD>
<LD>   Sacramento Superior Court Judge Loren McMaster said the tenants
will stay put until he has a chance to hold a March 20 hearing on
their request for an injunction.</LD>
<LD>   Gensiro Kawamoto caused the controversy earlier this month when
his property managers gave 30-day eviction notices to tenants in 420
houses in the Sacramento region and another 150 homes in Santa Rosa.
Some tenants have lived for more than a decade in the comfortable
middle-class houses, which Kawamoto intends to sell.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys in the dispute, which has grabbed national media
attention, said they hoped to soon reach an agreement that might
allow renters until summer to find other living arrangements or an
opportunity to buy their houses.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're very hopeful,'' said Jon Givner, a staff lawyer with Legal
Services of Northern California who represented tenants.</TE>
<TE>   The mass eviction caused a storm of protest. Tenants in whole
neighborhoods owned by Kawamoto faced the unexpected chore of pulling
children from school and finding new living quarters in an
extraordinarily tight rental market. The vacancy rate in Sacramento
County is about 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Givner said lawyers argued that the ''wholesale evacuation'' of
entire neighborhoods threatened to create ghost towns that could be
plagued by arson, crime, squatters and other public nuisances.</TE>
<TE>   School officials, he said, worried that children would be pulled
out of classes, disrupting their education and undermining funding to
their schools. About two-thirds of renters in the neighborhoods have
school-age children, Givner said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenant lawyers also said Kawamoto was engaged in unlawful business
practices because in some cases eviction notices did not offer
renters 30 days to get out. One 75-year-old woman got a notice to
vacate in 12 days, Givner said.</TE>
<TE>   A Hawaii-based representative for Kawamoto has said the investor
needs to unload the houses quickly to finance unspecified investment
opportunities that are available only every few decades.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Giberson, Kawamoto's attorney in Sacramento, declined to
comment after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Renters in the Sacramento area communities of Citrus Heights,
Orangevale, Antelope and Rocklin were pleased by the decision.</TE>
<TE>   ''I hope we can buy more time. Thirty days isn't enough to do
anything,'' said Edwin Gipson, a 70-year-old retiree who has lived in
one of Kawamoto's rental houses for a decade. ''My wife and I would
like to buy, but we don't know whether we can qualify. I'll probably
have to go back to work.''</TE>
<TE>   Tenants rights groups say about half the renters might try to buy
their homes if given the chance. The houses are expected to range in
price from $180,000 to $225,000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California's campaign to slash electricity use during last year's
energy crisis cut overall consumption by 6.7% and peak demand in
summer--when hundreds of hours of blackouts were feared but none
occurred--by 10%, a state report said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, issued by Gov. Gray Davis, said that by last June a
blend of conservation actions, including consumer rebates and more
efficient building standards, had reduced demand by about 5,570
megawatts. The savings rose to more than 6,300 megawatts by October.</LD>

<LD>City officials must require a developer to stabilize a hillside that
partially collapsed in 1998 during El Nino storms, severely damaging
or threatening five homes, a judge has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   SunCal Cos. of Anaheim helped cause the collapse while grading for
the Pacific Point project, Orange County Superior Court Judge William
F. McDonald ruled in a lawsuit that homeowners filed in May 2001
against the city and the developer of the 256-acre project.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Curtis, forced out of his Meredith Canyon home after the
landslide, said Tuesday that the ruling "means they're going to have
to make the homes stable so that they can be lived in again. In order
to do that, they'll have to put the hill back."</LD>

<LD>An officer who championed Santa Ana's community policing program more
than two decades ago will become the first Latino police captain in
the department's 116-year history.</LD>
<LD>   George Saadeh, who grew up in Honduras and sold flowers on the
street corners of Los Angeles as a teenager, will manage the
department's largest bureau: the 200 officers who patrol city
streets.</LD>
<LD>   Latino rights activists said Saadeh's promotion helps the
credibility of a police department in a city that has the largest

<HD>FERC Sought Advice From Enron in Oct.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal energy regulators sought policy advice from Enron Corp. last
fall, even after the company disclosed its financial problems and
revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into
the matter, new documents show.</LD>
<LD>   On Oct. 17--a day after Enron disclosed that it would slash its
shareholder equity by $1.2 billion--an assistant to Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood e-mailed two Enron officials,
asking for their advice about the agency's efforts to regulate
electricity transmission lines in the West, according to documents
obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes it's hard to see a clear path to gain public trust and
make markets work, but I couldn't be more impressed with Pat Wood's
ability to get us there," wrote Rob Gramlich, Wood's assistant, to
Alan Comnes and Tim Belden, two Enron officials. "I have a policy
question for you."</LD>
<TE>   Gramlich went on to ask the men about a certain pricing system
that regulators were considering for regional transmission markets in
the western U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Gramlich and Comnes continued to correspond
through the end of the month and met Oct. 30 in Washington to talk
"more about market structure in the West."</TE>
<TE>   A week earlier, Enron disclosed that the SEC had launched an
informal inquiry into the company's accounting irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   FERC spokesman Kevin Cadden said there was nothing improper about
the contacts, saying that Gramlich was gathering input about a FERC
issue from a variety of sources, including energy companies, consumer
groups and state officials.</TE>
<TE>   He said Gramlich turned to his former UC Berkeley classmates
Comnes, Enron's former director of government affairs, and Belden,
who oversaw Western operations., them at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Wood previously had said Enron did not wield any undue influence.
Documents show that Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, who endorsed
Wood's appointment as chairman, called Wood on Nov. 8 to discuss the
company's problems. Wood did not return the call.</TE>

<LD>   on Beardstown Book</LD>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. agreed to give credits toward book purchases to
settle a lawsuit brought by consumers who said the company made
fraudulent claims on the covers of "Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense
Investment Guide."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's Hyperion publishing unit agreed to give buyers of the
Beardstown Ladies' book, videotape or audiotape a $25 credit toward
another Hyperion book. Buyers of the paperback editions get a $15
credit, according to terms of the tentative settlement approved
earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   The Beardstown Ladies' Investment Club, a group of 16 mostly
elderly women in Beardstown, Ill., gained fame in the 1990s for
reportedly earning average returns that outperformed mutual funds and
professional money managers.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed on behalf of more than 800,000 people
nationwide in 1998, after an independent audit found that the
Beardstown Ladies misstated their investment performance. The book
claimed the club earned 23.4% a year on investments from 1984 to
1993, though a reporter for Chicago magazine later found the
annualized return was 9.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The group later admitted the 23.4% figure was inaccurate, saying
it resulted from a computer-input error.</TE>

<LD>TRW Inc. said it would be unable to respond today to Northrop Grumman
Corp.'s offer to acquire the company for $5.9 billion because it
needs additional time to review terms of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop Grumman, a Century City-based defense contractor, made an
unsolicited bid Thursday for TRW, maker of automotive parts and
defense electronics and asked the company to respond by Feb. 27.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa, TRW's top two
executives said the company "will conduct board discussions in the
near future and will respond in a timely fashion, but it will not be
before the close of business Feb. 27, 2002."</LD>
<TE>   A Northrop spokesman declined to comment other than to say the
company was "looking forward to a prompt response." Northrop has
retained a proxy solicitation firm in the event it makes a hostile
bid for Cleveland-based TRW.</TE>
<TE>   TRW shares rose 44 cents to close at $50.75, after surging 26%
since the bid was announced. Northrop fell 72 cents to $107.72. Both
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>   Greenberg said the insurer will begin having quarterly earnings

that named individuals inside the company and may result in the

first-quarter net income rose a better-than-expected 11% to $44.5

<DL></DL>
<LD>Home Depot Inc. reported a 53% jump in earnings for its fiscal fourth
quarter as a strong U.S. housing market, mild weather and store
discounts spurred sales.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 1 home-improvement retailer's earnings grew to
$710million, or 30 cents a share, better than the 28-cent estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call. Sales for the
quarter ended Feb. 3 rose 29% to $13.5billion, while sales at stores
open at least a year increased 5%.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it expects same-store sales to rise a
mid-single-digit percentage in the first quarter and that gross
margins will be slightly better than a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Atlanta-based Home Depot fell 56 cents to $51.51 on the
NYSE, hurt by a report of a bigger-than-expected drop in consumer
confidence in February.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>United Parcel Service Inc. said second-quarter profit may fall short
of analysts' expectations, but earnings for the first quarter will
come in at the high end of its earlier forecast.</LD>
<LD>   The largest package-delivery company said the percentage rise in
second half may be "in the low teens" if the U.S. economy improves
and the company reaches a timely contract agreement with the
Teamsters union, Chief Financial Officer Scott Davis said at a
meeting with analysts and investors.</LD>
<LD>   Stable prices and better-than-expected cost controls are helping
as first-quarter shipment volumes trail year-earlier levels, Davis
said.</LD>
<TE>   First-quarter earnings will be at the high end of the company's
forecast last month of 40 to 47 cents a share, Davis said. Analysts
were expecting 46 cents, on average, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects second-quarter profit of 50 to 55 cents.
Analysts had forecast 55 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta-based company's shares rose $1.21 cents at $58.31 on
the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Federated Department Stores Inc., the owner of Macy's and
Bloomingdale's chains, said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit dropped
23% as it reduced prices to attract holiday shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   Profit from operations, excluding results from its Fingerhut unit
and restructuring costs, fell to $310 million, or $1.90 a share. That
met the company's reduced forecast and beat analysts' average
estimate of $1.86.</LD>
<LD>   Fingerhut's results were excluded because Federated plans to sell
or close the business, which has been a drag on the retailer's
earnings.</LD>
<TE>   Federated also raised its earnings forecast for the current year
to $3.30 to $3.55 a share, from a previous estimate of $3.25 to

<HD>Hanover Compressor to Restate Profit</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hanover Compressor Co. will restate earnings for two years after
shareholders accused it this month of inflating profit from its
natural gas businesses. The company said the Securities and Exchange
Commission asked for information about the company's Hampton Roads
venture with Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which owned a gas plant in
Nigeria.</LD>
<LD>   Hanover, which provides compressors to gas pipelines and
processors, will reduce earnings since 2000 by $8.9 million, the
company said.</LD>
<LD>   Hanover Chief Executive Michael J. McGhan said the accounting
mistakes occurred as the Houston-based company spent more than $1.1
billion acquiring rival gas-compression businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Hanover shares rose $1.92, or 14%, to close at $16.02 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A French court said it would try Internet giant Yahoo and its former
chief executive for allegedly condoning war crimes by allowing the
sale of Nazi memorabilia on Yahoo sites.</LD>
<LD>   Former Yahoo CEO Timothy Koogle faces a maximum sentence of five
years and a $39,800 fine if found guilty--a verdict that could have
broad implications for international free-speech rights in the
Internet age.</LD>
<LD>   France ordered the California-based company in November 2000 to
stop people in France from accessing the sites, but a U.S. federal
judge ruled last November that Yahoo was not bound to comply with
French laws governing Internet content on U.S.-based sites.</LD>

<HD>Police Need More Crisis Training, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Most fatal shootings involved a mentally
ill person.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County law enforcement officers have fatally shot 32 suspects
in the last decade, with more than half the cases involving a
mentally ill person, according to a grand jury report released
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   With the elimination of mental health facilities--including the
1997 closure of Camarillo State Hospital--incidents involving
mentally ill suspects will continue to rise, the panel concluded.</LD>
<LD>   For this reason, grand jurors recommend police agencies increase
their crisis intervention training for officers to help them better
handle calls involving the mentally disturbed.</LD>
<TE>   Such training will "decrease the number of police shootings," the
report concluded, and "the lives of citizens and police officers
will, as a consequence, be saved."</TE>
<TE>   The panel's recommendations include having peace officers attend
40 hours of specialized training before July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, 911 dispatchers should be included in the training,
and refresher courses should be offered to those who already have
been trained, the report determined.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are becoming more sensitized to the issue of handling
mentally ill patients and they understand they must deal differently
with people who have these illnesses of the brain than with people
who don't," said Supervisor John Flynn, a member of the county's
Mental Health Board.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn agreed with the grand jury's findings, but said the issue is
far more complex. County officials, Flynn said, must do more to house
and treat mentally ill residents instead of "locking them up in
prisons and jails."</TE>
<TE>   In its report, the grand jury acknowledged the county's new Crisis
Intervention Training Academy, which was established last year after
the death of 56-year-old Thomas Patton of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Patton was shot 26 times and killed by deputies after he
confronted them with a knife outside his home. Authorities concluded
that Patton was mentally disturbed and that deputies had acted
reasonably.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Capt. Kenton Rainey said Tuesday that all area law
enforcement leaders have agreed to have at least 10% of their patrol
forces attend the training.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the first 25 peace officers graduated from the crisis
intervention academy. Officials hope to conduct quarterly courses at
the Ventura County Criminal Justice Training Center in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "Even before the grand jury finished its study, we were trying to
do as much as possible," said Eric Nishimoto, a sheriff's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   To graduate from the crisis intervention academy, officers must
attend four, 10-hour days of classes with instructors who include
mental health experts, police officials and relatives of the mentally
ill.</TE>
<TE>   The officers learn details about various forms of mental illnesses
and also visit a halfway house, where they speak with patients,
Rainey said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good thing," Rainey said. "This training is so much
more than what they get in the [county's peace officer training]
academy."</TE>
<TE>   That academy, held at the same Camarillo facility, offers cadets
nine hours of training on recognizing and dealing with the mentally
ill, Rainey said. The academy conducts a total of 957 hours of
instruction.</TE>
<TE>   The captain said he anticipated that a 10th of the patrol officers
in Ventura County would be trained within two years. It is not clear
whether the program will continue beyond that target.</TE>

<TE>   "The number needs to be much higher [than 10%]," he said. "We have
people out there, some schizophrenic, who are listening to voices and
simply don't know that what they are doing is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Grand jurors compiled the five-page report after visiting the
area's police agencies and researching how officers and deputies
respond to calls involving the mentally ill. In addition, each police
agency gave the panel statistics on fatal shootings. Of the 32
suspects fatally shot since August 1992, at least 17 were people
thought to be mentally ill, the panel found.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, Oxnard police had seven fatal shootings
of mentally ill suspects during the time studied, the most of any
area police agency.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura City Councilman Neal Andrews, a former chairman of the
county Mental Health Board, said the crisis intervention academy had
already proven effective.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews reviewed reports from seven officers who graduated from
the program. They said that the lessons contributed to "positive
outcomes" in several cases.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major advancement for law enforcement in this county,"
Andrews said.</TE>

<HD>New Limits Approved for O.C. Airport</HD>
<DH>Air travel: Supervisors cap John Wayne's size through 2015
even as voters next week could scuttle plans for a second airport at
El Toro.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Wayne Airport would handle 1.4 million more passengers a year
under a plan approved Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County supervisors capped the airport's size through 2015
even as voters next week could scuttle long-standing plans to build a
second airport at El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   The move came at the urging of officials from Newport Beach and a
dozen other cities that lie under John Wayne flight paths. Those
officials worry that adoption of Measure W on next week's
ballot--which would rezone the former Marine Corps air station for a
park--would boost pressure to expand John Wayne.</LD>
<TE>   John Wayne's landmark restrictions are contained in a 1985
agreement, approved by a federal judge, that expires Dec. 31, 2005.
John Wayne is one of two airports in the country that have local
restrictions, which were banned by Congress in 1990. The other is
Long Beach Municipal Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County and Newport Beach officials now must hammer out an
agreement for the new restrictions with the airlines and the Federal
Aviation Administration. The Air Transport Assn., which represents
the nation's leading airlines, warned that it will fight attempts to
keep limits at John Wayne in place past 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Showing a united front is crucial going into those negotiations,
several supervisors said Tuesday. The limited expansion was approved
unanimously after a 90-minute discussion that started with only three
supervisors--Jim Silva, Cynthia P. Coad and Todd Spitzer--expressing
support. Silva, who began representing Newport Beach this year after
redistricting, brokered the new limits.</TE>
<TE>   The unanimity was striking because for eight years the county's El
Toro planning has been led by a bare majority--Coad, Silva and
Supervisor Chuck Smith. Spitzer and Supervisor Tom Wilson have long
opposed an airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   "I've received over 9,000 postcards and phone calls in support"
from residents and city officials around the county, Silva said,
holding up one of a dozen bags bulging with mail.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the number of passengers using John Wayne Airport
each year would jump to a maximum of 9.8 million, from 8.4 million.
The county currently limits to 73 the number of commercial flights
allowed each day by the loudest aircraft; that number would increase
to 85. The county also would build four new passenger gates, bringing
the total to 18.</TE>
<TE>   Smith agreed to go along with the plan after Newport Beach
officials deferred to his request that the number of daily cargo
flights be increased from two to four. Only 4% of cargo generated by
Orange County is shipped out of John Wayne Airport, Smith said, with
the rest loaded onto trucks and sent primarily from Los Angeles
International and Ontario International airports.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson spent 20 minutes warning his colleagues that failing to
negotiate passenger and flight limits with the airlines before
arriving at a final number could backfire, with the county sued and
possibly losing the ability to regulate John Wayne Airport after
2006. But he eventually bowed to Silva and Spitzer, who represent the
so-called corridor cities under the flight paths.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the unity displayed by the county and cities over the
new John Wayne limits, which he contrasted to the acrimonious split
over the fate of El Toro, will be important in negotiations with the
airlines and the FAA. Public support for an airport at El Toro has
dropped since it was approved by voters in 1994, resulting in a
virtual civil war between south County cities fighting the county's
plans and other cities backing them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time we all stand together as one county,"
Spitzer said. "I feel much better going into this battle that we're
working together. Because we've become known in [Washington] D.C. and
around the country as a county divided."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone praised the expansion plan Tuesday. Residents from
Santa Ana Heights, the neighborhood closest to John Wayne, said
additional flights and traffic would destroy the area. The closest
homes in Santa Ana Heights sit about 700 feet from the end of John
Wayne's runway.</TE>
<TE>   Residents Ann Watt and Greg Carroll said the county's
environmental analysis of John Wayne, also approved Tuesday, ignored
the effect of adding more aircraft pollution and traffic to the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   But members of the Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Tustin, Santa Ana
and Anaheim city councils urged the county to adopt the limited
expansion plan, as did officials with Orange and the El Toro Reuse
Planning Authority, which represents a dozen south Orange County
cities.</TE>
<TE>   The county also has a nighttime curfew for commercial flights at
the airport. The curfew, adopted in the 1960s, would continue under
the new plan.</TE>
<TE>   On a lighter note, supervisors began their discussion on the new
limits by joking with Spitzer, who participated in the meeting by
phone from Washington, where he is on business in his role as
chairman of the Orange County Transportation Authority. Asked about
his trip, Spitzer said his flight was canceled in St. Louis and that
he still hadn't received his luggage.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had direct flights [to Washington], you wouldn't have to
worry about that," Silva told Spitzer, a staunch opponent of a new
airport at El Toro, noting that there are no direct flights to
Washington out of John Wayne Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I thought my vote was important today," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>Expanding Flights</TE>
<TE>Orange County supervisors unanimously approved extending
landmark restrictions on the capacity of John Wayne Airport
through 2015. The plan, which allows a modest increase in
passengers and flights by the loudest aircraft, replaces an
agreement that expires at the end of 2005.</TE>

<HD>Board OKs John Wayne Flight Caps Through 2015</HD>
<DH>Airport: A week before El Toro vote, supervisors plan
10-year extension with increase in passengers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Wayne Airport would handle 1.4 million more passengers a year
under a plan approved Tuesday. Orange County supervisors capped the
airport's size through 2015 even as voters next week could scuttle
long-standing plans to build a second airport at El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   The move came at the urging of officials from Newport Beach and a
dozen other cities that lie under John Wayne flight paths. Those
officials worry that adoption of Measure W on next week's
ballot--which would rezone the former Marine Corps air station for a
park--would boost pressure to expand John Wayne.</LD>
<LD>   John Wayne's landmark restrictions are contained in a 1985
agreement, approved by a federal judge, that expires Dec. 31, 2005.
John Wayne is one of two airports in the country that have local
restrictions, which were banned by Congress in 1990. The other is
Long Beach Municipal Airport.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County and Newport Beach officials now must hammer out an
agreement for the new restrictions with the airlines and the Federal
Aviation Administration. The Air Transport Assn., which represents
the nation's leading airlines, warned that it will fight attempts to
keep limits at John Wayne in place past 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Showing a united front is critical going into those negotiations,
several supervisors said Tuesday. The limited expansion was approved
unanimously after a 90-minute discussion that started with only three
supervisors--Jim Silva, Cynthia P. Coad and Todd Spitzer--expressing
support. Silva, who began representing Newport Beach this year after
redistricting, brokered the new limits.</TE>
<TE>   The unanimity was striking because for eight years the county's El
Toro planning has been led by a bare majority--Coad, Silva and
Supervisor Chuck Smith. Spitzer and Supervisor Tom Wilson have long
opposed an airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   "I've received over 9,000 postcards and phone calls in support"
from residents and city officials around the county, Silva said,
holding up one of a dozen bags bulging with mail.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the number of passengers using John Wayne Airport
each year would jump to a maximum of 9.8 million, from 8.4 million.
The county currently limits to 73 the number of commercial flights
allowed each day by the loudest aircraft; that number would increase
to 85. The county also would build four new passenger gates, bringing
the total to 18.</TE>
<TE>   Smith agreed to go along with the plan after Newport Beach
officials deferred to his request that the number of daily cargo
flights be increased from two to four. Only 4% of cargo generated by
Orange County is shipped out of John Wayne Airport, Smith said, with
the rest loaded onto trucks and sent primarily from Los Angeles
International and Ontario International airports.</TE>
<TE>   Board's Action Could Backfire, Wilson Warns</TE>
<TE>   Wilson spent 20 minutes warning his colleagues that failing to
negotiate passenger and flight limits with the airlines before
arriving at a final number could backfire, with the county sued and
possibly losing the ability to regulate John Wayne Airport after
2006. But he eventually bowed to Silva and Spitzer, who represent the
so-called corridor cities under the flight paths.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the unity displayed by the county and cities over the
new John Wayne limits, which he contrasted to the acrimonious split
over the fate of El Toro, will be important in negotiations with the
airlines and the FAA. Public support for an airport at El Toro has
dropped since it was approved by voters in 1994, resulting in a
virtual civil war between South County cities fighting the county's
plans and other cities backing them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time we all stand together as one county,"
Spitzer said. "I feel much better going into this battle that we're
working together. Because we've become known in [Washington] D.C. and
around the country as a county divided."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone praised the expansion plan Tuesday. Residents from
Santa Ana Heights, the neighborhood closest to John Wayne, said
additional flights and traffic would destroy the area. The closest
homes in Santa Ana Heights sit about 700 feet from the end of John
Wayne's runway.</TE>
<TE>   Residents Ann Watt and Greg Carroll said the county's
environmental analysis of John Wayne, also approved Tuesday, ignored
the effect of adding more aircraft pollution and traffic to the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   But members of the Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Tustin, Santa Ana
and Anaheim city councils urged the county to adopt the limited
expansion plan, as did officials with Orange and the El Toro Reuse
Planning Authority, which represents a dozen south Orange County
cities. The county also has a nighttime curfew for commercial flights
at the airport. The curfew, adopted in the 1960s, would continue
under the new plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Decisions regarding [John Wayne] airport will not get any easier
after March 5," Costa Mesa Mayor Linda Dixon said. On a lighter note,
supervisors began their discussion on the new limits by joking with
Spitzer, who participated in the meeting by phone from Washington,
where he is on business in his role as chairman of the Orange County
Transportation Authority. Asked about his trip, Spitzer said his
flight was canceled in St. Louis and that he still hadn't received
his luggage.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had direct flights [to Washington], you wouldn't have to
worry about that," Silva told Spitzer, a staunch opponent of a new
airport at El Toro, noting that there are no direct flights to
Washington out of John Wayne Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I thought my vote was important today," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>Expanding Flights</TE>
<TE>Orange County supervisors unanimously approved extending
landmark restrictions on the capacity of John Wayne Airport
through 2015. The plan, which allows a modest increase in
passengers and flights by the loudest aircraft, replaces an
agreement that expires at the end of 2005.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc.'s CBS, William Morris Agency Inc. and about 20 other
television networks, producers and talent agencies face lawsuits
claiming they stopped giving work to scriptwriters over the age of
40.</LD>
<LD>   More than 150 writers refiled their suits about a month after a
federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that the writers could not sue the
television companies in a single lawsuit. The new suits were filed in
Los Angeles County Superior Court, claiming violations of state law.</LD>
<LD>   The writers claim the 23 companies, including Walt Disney Co.'s
Touchstone, General Electric Co.'s NBC and International Creative
Management Inc., stopped giving them work once they turned 40 and
replaced them with younger authors. The suits seek unspecified back
pay, punitive damages and an order halting the alleged practice.</LD>
<TE>   The suits say that while writers over 50 account for almost
one-third of the Writers Guild of America's membership, about 4% of
shows in NBC's 1997-98 broadcast season had writers credited in that
age range.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the entertainment companies did not return calls
seeking comment.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playboy Enterprises Inc. reported a narrowed fourth-quarter net loss
aided by growing cable television channels and better results in
online businesses.</LD>
<LD>   For the quarter, Playboy lost $11.7 million after all costs, or 47
cents a share, compared with last year's net loss of $29 million, or
$1.19 a share, including restructuring expenses of $3.7million and a
$24-million tax-related charge.</LD>
<LD>   Fourth-quarter revenue fell slightly to $77.97 million from $79.5
million in 2000's fourth quarter, primarily because of the
advertising market slump that has affected all publishers, and
newsstand sales of the magazine, which had fewer A-list celebrities
on the cover last quarter.</LD>

<LD>EchoStar Communications Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp. promised
to deliver local television channels in all 210 U.S. markets if the
government approves their $30-billion satellite-TV combination.</LD>
<LD>   The two biggest U.S. satellite-TV providers now offer local
broadcasts in 42 cities. They've asked the Federal Communications
Commission for approval to launch a satellite to provide the added
local service.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say EchoStar's planned purchase of Hughes, owner of the
DirecTV service, will limit consumer choices in rural areas lacking
cable TV.</LD>
<TE>   EchoStar says the combination will give viewers a competitor to

<DH>Ethics: San Bernardino County accepts $7.75 million from
brokerage over improper gifts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Bernardino County officials Tuesday announced the settlement of a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit against a brokerage accused of offering
luxury trips, meals and call girls to county officials in exchange
for investment deals. Supervisors agreed to accept $7.75 million from
Salomon Smith Barney to settle its portion of the suit.</LD>
<LD>   "Salomon Smith Barney did the right thing," said San Bernardino
County Treasurer-Tax Collector Dick Larsen, who led the county's
effort to recover money lost in a long-running corruption scandal.
"They made the right business decision."</LD>
<LD>   As part of the same suit, the county agreed to accept $750,000 to
settle its claim against a second company, CDC NVest Short Term
Corporate Income Fund, and its former agent, Jeff Jackson, who also
was accused of offering improper gifts to officials.</LD>
<TE>   Larsen said he became aware of irregularities after noticing that
the county had been hit with a $308,000 commission fee from Salomon
Smith Barney for which the county, as a large investor, should have
been exempt.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation later revealed that an agent for the New England
brokerage, Peter Morrison, earned the company about $4.75 million in
fees from improper investments by the county. The county also lost
out on as much as $24 million because of inappropriate investment
choices, Larsen said.</TE>
<TE>   The county's suit, filed in August 2000, claimed that Morrison
bribed three county officials into making investments with his firm.
Former county officials--Chief Administrative Officer James Hlawek,
Treasurer Tom O'Donnell and Investment Officer Sol Levin--accepted
lavish dinners, cash payments of up to $1,000, and trips to Costa
Rica, Paris and other vacation spots. Morrison also allegedly offered
the men visits from call girls, though it is unclear if those offers
were accepted, Larsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulations bar securities firms from offering gifts worth
more than $100 to government officials, and all county employees are
required to report all gifts they receive. Hlawek, O'Donnell and
Levin failed to report most of their gifts.</TE>
<TE>   The three men are defendants in the lawsuit. Their portion of the
suit is still pending, with a hearing scheduled for June 3.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the three men, who resigned from their county posts
in 1999, pleaded guilty to criminal charges of bribery. Levin and
O'Donnell were sentenced to 366 days in a halfway house earlier this
year. Hlawek will be sentenced April 23.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Marmaro, a Los Angeles attorney representing Morrison,
said that despite the settlement his client is blameless.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter Morrison did nothing wrong and there is no credible
evidence that he did," Marmaro said. Morrison, who also was named as
a defendant, will be dropped from the suit as part of the settlement
agreement. Once a top earner for the firm, Morrison has since retired
from Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>

<LD>Radio giant Clear Channel Communications Inc. reported a dramatically
wider fourth quarter loss because of an advertising slump and
across-the-board restructuring, and the news helped drive down shares
by almost 10% in after-hours trading.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's biggest radio broadcaster reported a net loss of
$365.6 million, or 61 cents a share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31,
compared with a net loss of $192 million, or 33 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Sales in the latest quarter fell 8%, to $1.86
billion.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said it will take a pre-tax charge of $15 billion
to $25 billion in the current quarter because of a change in
accounting rules. Companies now are required to more accurately
account for goodwill, or the amount they overpaid for assets. Clear
Channel has grown dramatically since the mid-'90s with a string of
acquisitions and now owns about 1,225 radio stations and 19 TV
stations.</LD>
<TE>   Clear Channel's quarterly earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, a critical measure of media companies'
performance, plunged 46% from the year-earlier period to $344
million, or about $90 million below some Wall Street estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as big a miss from a cash-flow perspective as I've seen
in the media space" in about a year, said Jordan Rohan, analyst at
SoundView Technology group.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, fell 27 cents to
$49.09 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. But the
stock fell as low as $44 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel said it had hired 600 salespeople to solicit radio
advertisers amid the economic slowdown, but it had also fired about
2,000 employees from radio programming, engineering and other
operations during the last quarter to cut costs. The company said the
cuts resulted in severance and restructuring expenses totaling about
$80 million.</TE>
<TE>   Company President Mark Mays said the radio advertising market was
showing signs of improvement, but cautioned that sales in the
conglomerate's billboard operation and live-entertainment division
are likely to pick up more slowly.</TE>
<TE>   For all of 2001, Clear Channel posted a net loss of $1.14 billion,
or $1.93 a share, compared with net income of $248.8 million, or 57
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 49% to $7.97 billion
last year, due to a series of acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   At year's end Clear Channel had $9.5 billion in debt, but May said
the firm's $3 billion in available bank credit would cover its debts
during the next two to three years.</TE>
<TE>   Mays also said a federal court ruling last week that opened the
door to further consolidation in the cable and television industries.
He suggested the court decision wouldn't necessarily spur Clear
Channel to acquire additional TV outlets in the short term. But he
said the company is focused on increasing its market share in radio.</TE>
<TE>   "We're continually buying more radio stations," he said.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence Drops in February</HD>
<DH>Economy: The decline, which is larger than expected, is the
first in three months and reflects concern about jobs and earnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer confidence fell this month as concerns about
unemployment and reliability of company earnings reports dimmed
enthusiasm that had been building since September.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board's gauge of sentiment dropped to 94.1 after
rising to 97.8 in January. The decline was the first in three months
and larger than expected.</LD>
<LD>   More than 80% of those surveyed indicated they were concerned
about jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The decline may be a one-time occurrence that reflects doubts
about stock values in the wake of revelations about deceptive
accounting practices at Enron Corp., analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers remained optimistic about economic conditions in coming
months, and that may boost retailers' business.</TE>
<TE>   "While consumers see the future as reasonably bright, they live in
the present," said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at John Hancock
Financial Services Inc. in Boston. "They're worried about their jobs,
but at the same time, I think they sense that this mild recession
appears to be ending and that will raise their hopes."</TE>
<TE>   The confidence index sank to a 71/2-year low in November as
Americans were reeling from the September terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, confidence has increased as the U.S. has made progress
in the war against terrorism and evidence has built that the economy
is rebounding from recession.</TE>
<TE>   February's gauge of consumer expectations for the next six months
fell to 93.6, but it still is the second highest since August.
January's level of 97.6 was the largest since March, when the
recession began.</TE>
<TE>   Personal spending grew in the fourth quarter at a 5.4% annual
rate, the fastest in almost two years. Americans have the means to
spend in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of refunds sent to taxpayers through Feb. 15 is 15.2%
more than it was in the same period last year, Internal Revenue
Service figures show.</TE>

<HD>Gap Reports $34.2-Million Quarterly Loss</HD>
<DH>Retail: Clothing chain plans to sell $1 billion of
convertible bonds to boost finances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gap Inc., the nation's largest specialty clothing retailer, reported
its second consecutive quarterly loss Tuesday, continuing a two-year
slide marked by fashion missteps and deep markdowns.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing its fiscal fourth-quarter results, the San
Francisco-based parent of Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores
said it plans to sell $1 billion of convertible bonds to boost its
flagging finances.</LD>
<LD>   The company also reshuffled leadership in its largest division,
Gap stores, splitting up the merchandising for men's and women's
clothing.</LD>
<TE>   Although the latest results were in line with Wall Street
expectations, Gap's chief executive, Millard "Mickey" Drexler, said
2001 was the company's most difficult year.</TE>
<TE>   Gap stores suffered as the company moved away from trademark
basics, such as khaki pants and button-down shirts, and into a more
fashion-focused mix. Old Navy slumped as it became focused on a
younger customer, straying from the target family audience,
executives said.</TE>
<TE>   On a conference call with analysts, Drexler acknowledged the
fumble, particularly at Gap stores, where he spoke of
"horrible-looking graphic men's T-shirts" and "strange, double-patch"
pants.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could tell you that our problems were over," Drexler
said. He added that the company has made progress. But the company
also warned that sales were continuing to slide in February.</TE>
<TE>   Through Monday, sales at stores open at least a year were down 17%
this month compared with the same period last year, with same-store
sales at Gap below the company's plan and sales at the other two
divisions slightly above internal estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some good news relative to the non-merchandise issues
in that inventories are low, capital expenditures are down and store
growth is lower than planned," said Todd Slater, an analyst with
Lazard Freres in New York. But the problem is, it doesn't go far
enough, he said. "It will be a much slower road to recovery than if
the company were to more aggressively close stores and shake up its
sourcing and merchandise organization."</TE>
<TE>   For its fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, Gap posted a loss of
$34.2 million, or 4 cents a share. A year earlier, the company posted
a profit of $278.1 million, or 31 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Total sales for the quarter fell 11% to $4.1 billion. Companywide,
sales at stores open at least a year, a key industry measure, fell
16%.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-quarter results include a $15-million charge related to
subleasing losses at the company's headquarters in California and the
planned closures of distribution centers in Kentucky and Holland.</TE>
<TE>   For the full fiscal year, Gap reported an $8-million loss, or 1
cent a share, with pretax charges of $131 million, on sales of $13.85
billion. In the previous fiscal year, earnings were $877 million, or
$1 a share, on revenue of $13.67 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Heidi Kunz said the company does not
expect to close more stores in 2002 than in 2001, when the company
shuttered 92 locations.</TE>
<TE>   In planning to issue as much as $1 billion in bonds, the Gap is
seeking to strengthen its balance sheet. Recently, Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's cut Gap's debt ratings to junk status. That boosted
the company's annual interest costs on $700 million of bonds it sold
in November by $8.75 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gap reported its results after U.S. markets closed. After rising
64 cents to $13.55 during the regular session on the New York Stock
Exchange, Gap shares fell as low as $12.37 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>Possible HP Payouts Revealed</HD>

<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina and Compaq Computer
Corp. CEO Michael Capellas together may be paid more than $115
million if the two computer makers merge, Walter Hewlett said.</LD>
<LD>   Walter Hewlett for weeks has been pressing the companies to
disclose what top officials would be paid if shareholders approve
Hewlett-Packard's plan to buy Compaq. He said the pay packages may
affect investors' votes on the deal.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday he released figures, which include two years' salary
and bonus plus stock options, he said the companies considered when
they announced the deal.</LD>
<TE>   Walter Hewlett, son of co-founder William Hewlett, has started a
proxy fight to topple the deal, which he said will make the company
too dependent on low-profit personal computers. Hewlett-Packard
investors will vote March 19.</TE>
<TE>   "The details of the compensation packages contemplated for Ms.
Fiorina and Mr. Capellas are important," Walter Hewlett said in a
report on the possible executive pay. "HP's stockholders deserve to
know this information."</TE>
<TE>   The Palo Alto-based firm said no pay decisions have been made.</TE>
<TE>   The firm considered paying Fiorina $1.6 million in salary and a
$4.8-million bonus annually for two years, and stock options with an
"estimated current value" of $57 million, said Hewlett, a member of
the board's compensation committee. Capellas may receive a $1-million
salary and $3.8-million bonus for two years, with options worth $38
million, Hewlett said.</TE>
<TE>   Those earlier discussions were "aborted" and won't be used as a
minimum or benchmark for future agreements, the company said. On the
New York Stock Exchange, Hewlett-Packard shares rose 3 cents to close
at $20.01 and Compaq fell 20 cents to $10.40.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Slip on Drop in Consumer Confidence</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Hopes for a quick recovery are tempered by
worries spending may slow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market finished little changed Tuesday, as a surprising
decline in consumer confidence helped to cut short a two-session
rally.</LD>
<LD>   But many of the hottest stock groups of recent weeks--including
home builders and discount retailers--continued to advance, paying
little heed to concerns that consumers may be growing more cautious.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury bond yields jumped in advance of Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress today. He is expected to
sound mostly upbeat about the economy.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrials eased 30.45 points, or
0.3%, to 10,115.26, after rallying 311.03 points in the previous two
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.02 points, or 0.2%, to
1,766.86, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was off fractionally.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to
94.1 this month from a revised 97.8 in January. Analysts had expected
a February reading of 97.</TE>
<TE>   The decline, reversing two consecutive monthly gains, reflects
increasing consumer pessimism about the job outlook and the economy,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone can point to this statistic and say, 'Here's the consumer,
starting to give ground,'" said Joseph V. Battipaglia, investment
strategist at Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York. "That would spook the market
and that's what we see playing out here."</TE>
<TE>   Stocks rallied at the opening bell, then quickly slumped. In
addition to the consumer confidence report, analysts attributed the
market's morning slide to a rumor, quickly denied by the Pentagon,
that the U.S. had ground troops in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some experts said the market's performance of the last few
days suggests it might be shaking off concerns about corporate
accounting scandals in the aftermath of the collapses of Enron and
Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Rising stocks outnumbered losers Tuesday by 18 to 13 on the New
York Stock Exchange and by 9 to 8 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow on Monday reached its highest close since Jan. 8, and is
up nearly 1% year to date. But Nasdaq is down 9.4% this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, yields on longer-term Treasuries rose ahead of
Greenspan's testimony today. The 10-year T-note yield rose to 4.92%
from 4.85% Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk is that [Greenspan] gives us a hint he is impressed"
with the economy, David Robin, a strategist at Fimat USA, told
Bloomberg News. Despite the consumer confidence data, other recent
economic data have suggested a recovery has ensued, heightening bond
investors' expectations that the Fed may begin to raise rates later
this year, Robin said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the 10-year T-note yield remains below its level of 5.05%
at the end of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading gold revived, with near-term futures
gaining $5.30 to $298 an ounce in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Retailers continued to rally, led by Federated Department
Stores, which rose $2.64 to $41.66 after boosting its expectations
for 2002 earnings. Other retail winners included Target, up 97 cents
to $45.72, and Wal-Mart, up $1.45 to $62.10.</TE>
<TE>   * Home builders rose further after soaring Monday on reports of
strong January sales. Ryland leaped $2.74 to $89.69 and Toll Bros.
gained $3.32 to $47.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Some major tech shares weakened, including Intel, off $1 to
$30.32, and IBM, down $1.15 to $97.15.</TE>

<HD>Barksdale to Testify on Deal With Microsoft</HD>
<DH>Courts: Netscape ex-CEO says the proposed settlement would
aid the software giant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Netscape Communications Corp. Chief Executive James Barksdale,
a key witness in next month's Microsoft antitrust trial, will testify
that if the software giant's proposed settlement with the Justice
Department had been in place six years ago, Netscape might never have
been formed.</LD>
<LD>   As the lead-off witness in the Justice Department's first trial
against the software giant in 1998, Barksdale won points with his
folksy language. He told a federal judge then that Microsoft had used
a variety of unfair means to crush Netscape, tying its own Internet
Explorer browser to the omnipresent Windows operating system and
threatening to stop making Office software for Apple computers if
Apple kept shipping Netscape.</LD>
<LD>   In a recent deposition taken before the new trial, Barksdale said
he stuck by what he said nearly four years ago. And he said he
planned to go into detail about how the proposed settlement would
make things even easier for Microsoft to win in new markets.</LD>
<TE>   The interview was conducted Feb. 2 in Washington and was first
released to the media after U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly granted a request by the Los Angeles Times and other
newspapers for access to depositions.</TE>
<TE>   A general theme of Barksdale's objections to the proposed deal
among Microsoft, the Justice Department  and nine states that had
sued was that various provisions in the document give computer
companies new freedoms and then undercut them with exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "They start off sounding like everybody is going to be good
friends, and the second half seems to take it away," Barksdale said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he cited computer companies' new right to put some
types of third-party programs on Windows-based machines--as long as
Microsoft has a competing program.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, what if they don't have a competing product? I'm out here
with a flapjack actuator; they don't have one. According to this
document, I can't launch it," Barksdale said. "That's a terribly
chilling thing."</TE>
<TE>   He also faulted the provision that allows Microsoft to pester
computer buyers after two weeks to ask them whether they want to
switch to more Microsoft programs. "You could say, 'You sure you
don't want to sign up for Internet Explorer?' Nobody's going to build
a competitive product to something that has that kind of distribution
and marketing muscle across hundreds of millions of desktops," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Barksdale also said that Microsoft could use a loophole on
sensitive security information to avoid new requirements that it
disclose to competitors more information about how Windows interacts
with smaller programs.</TE>
<TE>   On appeal after the previous trial, a higher court found that
Microsoft had abused its monopoly position, sending the case back to
the district court to determine appropriate remedies.</TE>
<TE>   After Netscape was sold to Microsoft rival America Online Inc.,
now AOL Time Warner Inc., Barksdale became a venture capitalist. He
said venture firms as a rule won't back anything that competes
head-on with Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   With such a light punishment as that backed by the Justice
Department, he said, far fewer software start-ups will get off the
ground. And Netscape, which ignited the Internet boom with its 1995
initial public offering, would never have been funded.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft and attorneys for the states had no immediate comment on
Barksdale's testimony.</TE>

<HD>Music Industry Coalition Fighting Contract Limits</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Group seeks to derail a bill that would erase
its state exemption from a 7-year maximum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Record labels and music industry businesses banded together Tuesday
to fight proposed state legislation that would limit the duration of
recording contracts.</LD>
<LD>   Calling itself the California Music Coalition, the group includes
the major record labels and their affiliates, independent labels and
several small businesses ranging from CD pressers and video producers
to Diva Limousines of Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The group is trying to defeat a bill by state Sen. Kevin Murray
(D-Culver City) that would repeal a 15-year-old provision in the
state Labor Code that exempts record labels from a seven-year
limitation on personal service contracts. The group claims the
measure would allow recording artists to walk away from their
contracts and would drive jobs out of California because it would
become the only state with such contract limitations. The group also
contends that small businesses with limited capital would be hurt
most--and fewer new artists would get signed to contracts.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all a matter of risks and rewards," said Miles Copeland,
owner of Sherman Oaks-based label Ark 21 Records, which has a
distribution deal with Universal. "If you take away the rewards, the
risks go up and fewer acts get signed and the deals will be worse for
those artists."</TE>
<TE>   The coalition announced itself on the eve of the Grammy Awards and
hours before Don Henley and other recording artists held benefit
concerts to raise funds in their fight against the record industry.</TE>
<TE>   Henley said the coalition was a misguided effort by the major
record labels to portray the fight as one of big successful music
stars versus independent labels and other small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're primarily interested in the practices of the major labels,"
Henley said. "The record industry was doing just fine in California
for many decades prior to 1987 when they got the exemption. Artists
are not going to take advantage of a record label and then sit on
their hands. An artist needs to work; an artist wants to work."</TE>

<HD>Pensions a Surprise for Farm Workers</HD>
<DH>Labor: The UFW is attempting to contact thousands of aging
migrant field hands who are entitled to part of $100-million fund.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN MELLEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WATSONVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When the stranger showed up at his tiny house six months ago, the
86-year-old retired farm worker didn't trust what he was hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Modesto Montero, a slight man with wrinkled brown hands and a back
hunched over after years of working in the lettuce fields of
California's Salinas Valley, didn't remember any pension.</LD>
<LD>   But when Doug Blaylock handed him a check for $73,748, Montero
became a believer.</LD>
<TE>   "Praise God, I'm the luckiest man alive," said Montero, who
immigrated to this country from the Philippines during the
Depression.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades after the United Farm Workers staged its toughest
battles to organize field hands, workers such as Montero are
discovering the fruits of their labor.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW is trying to reach thousands of aging migrant farm workers
who are owed millions in pension funds thanks to a program
established in the mid-1970s by the union's founder, Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   It is no easy task. Many of those who devoted years of
backbreaking labor to the fields and sacrificed for la causa during
numerous strikes don't know they are entitled to thousands of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Also, many of the workers used multiple Social Security numbers to
dodge immigration laws, so many of the numbers proved to be invalid.</TE>
<TE>   "We have thousands of just skeletal records out there," Blaylock
said. "There's no way we can find these people with just names and
Social Security numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Growers pay 5 to 25 cents per hour worked into the pension plan.
The fund has grown to $100 million, with 10,000 members. More than
2,200 retirees are receiving benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Few farmers offer retirement benefits to people who work the
fields. The UFW boasts that its Juan de la Cruz pension plan, named
for a UFW activist fatally shot on a picket line in 1973, is the only
union pension fund specifically for farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The UFW pension plan belies the notion that farm labor has to be
this low-wage, dead-end occupation," said UFW spokesman Marc
Grossman. "Cesar took exception with that."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has worked under UFW contract for five years may be
eligible. The pension once required 10 years of service for
eligibility, but that requirement has been reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, the UFW is obligated to make a reasonable
effort to find pensioners. It has sent letters to any known address,
broadcast notices about the pension on its La Campesina, or Farm
Worker, radio network and has spread the word through mainstream
media.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have collected, it's like hitting the jackpot.</TE>
<TE>   Montero recalled that when he left the Philippines many years ago,
he was told he would live a long life and grow wealthy. In September,
when Blaylock arrived with the check, Montero told his daughters,
"See, it's coming true."</TE>

<HD>Fewer Americans Saving for Retirement</HD>
<DH>Finances: A survey says 70% of workers are confident they
will have enough money to live comfortably.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Americans are approaching retirement with a combination of inadequate
savings and unrealistic expectations about their standard of living
after they quit working, according to a new survey.</LD>
<LD>   Although fewer Americans are saving and planning for retirement in
2002 than in the past, 70% said they were very or somewhat confident
that they would have enough savings to live comfortably, according to
the annual Retirement Confidence Survey by the Employee Benefit
Research Institute. That was up from 63% who were confident about
their retirement prospects in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the survey found that 67% of Americans have some
retirement savings, down from 70% in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The survey results were released on the eve of the National Summit
on Retirement Savings--a Washington confab required by a 1997 federal
law called Savings are Vital to Everyone's Retirement. The EBRI
survey found that almost half of all workers have saved less than
$50,000 for retirement, and 15% say they've saved nothing. Less than
one-third have even tried to figure out how much money they'll need
to retire.</TE>
<TE>   About 44% of those surveyed expect that their personal savings
will be their biggest source of income in retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The EBRI survey was conducted in January through a telephone poll
of more than 1,000 Americans age 25 and older. The margin for error
is 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Savings rates vary dramatically based on personality type, said
Dallas Salisbury, president of the Washington-based institute.</TE>
<TE>   About 43% of the population fall into "saver" and "planner" types,
who are far more likely to have substantial amounts set aside for
retirement, according to the survey. The remainder is hampered by
either impulsive spending, financial setbacks or denial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we continue to develop savings tools and
messages that reach out not only to individuals of different ages,
but also to those in other specific categories, such as lower-income
workers, women or even those who work for small employers that do not
offer retirement plans," said Don Blandin, president of the American
Savings Education Council.</TE>
<TE>   These and other topics will be on the agenda at the savers summit,
which starts Thursday in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The first summit, held in 1998, concluded that government and
industry needed to do a better job of informing the public about the
importance of saving and about the tools available to help.</TE>
<TE>   This year's summit will feature speeches by President Bush and
Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, but will be largely devoted to creating
generational "action plans" aimed at boosting savings in every age
group.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Probe Viatical Fraud</HD>
<DH>Investments: Congress is told that strict regulation is
needed for an industry that offers the terminally ill an early
payoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A growing number of Americans are being taken in by misleading offers
of "guaranteed" returns on viatical settlements--a risky investment
product that needs to be more tightly regulated, lawmakers were told
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Viatical investments are life insurance policies sold to investors
for a fraction of the death benefit. For example, a $100,000 policy
may be sold for $70,000 to an investor, who can cash in the policy
for its full value, less expenses, when the policyholder dies.</LD>
<LD>   Viatical settlements were conceived in the '80s to provide cash to
AIDS patients who had life insurance but no heirs. But the industry
is now rife with fraud, said Rep. Sue W. Kelly, (R-N.Y.) chairwoman
of the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House
Financial Services Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Investors have lost more than $400 million to viatical frauds in
the last three years, making it one of the largest and fastest
growing financial crimes in the country, the North American
Securities Administrators Assn. said.</TE>
<TE>   Viatical settlements have been exempted from federal securities
laws since 1996, when the Securities and Exchange Commission lost a
suit against a Texas-based viatical company, which claimed viaticals
weren't securities.</TE>
<TE>   Partly as a result, con artists have gravitated to the industry,
Thomas E. Geyer, assistant director of the Ohio Department of
Insurance, told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Ohio authorities charged 17 people with trying to
defraud investors of $105 million in a scheme involving Liberte
Capital Group, a Toledo viatical company that allegedly arranged for
terminally ill people to conceal conditions such as AIDS when
applying for insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio recently passed legislation to put viatical settlements under
the purview of state securities regulators, who can require that the
investments be sold by licensed individuals, be registered with state
securities officials and that the risks of the investment be
disclosed to investors, Geyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Several other states also regulate viaticals under insurance or
state securities rules. However, the rules vary greatly among states,
and some states do not regulate viaticals at all, Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   That creates problems for both investors and policyholders who
want to sell their life insurance policies into the secondary market,
Stephen B. Mercer, a Washington attorney who volunteers at a legal
clinic serving AIDS patients, told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   "I see first-hand how persons living with the stress of a terminal
or chronic health condition benefit from cashing out their policies,
and I desperately want viatical settlements to continue to be a
practical option for persons with HIV and AIDS," Mercer testified.
"At the same time ... as the market is currently structured, no one
should be putting a dime into it."</TE>
<TE>   Not only is the industry prone to fraud, its structure encourages
middlemen to charge large commissions and fees, he said. That
discourages investors from buying viaticals, which hurts the
policyholders, who get less from the sale of their life insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The half-dozen people who testified Tuesday said the only way to
resolve the industry's woes was to create national legislation that
would give the SEC and state regulators authority to oversee
viaticals just like any other security sold to investors.</TE>
<TE>   "The alleged fraud resulting in the Liberte Capital Group case and
others like it around the country were not caused by anything
inherently wrong in a viatical or life settlement transaction, but
were caused by persons taking advantage of a perceived regulatory
vacuum," said David M. Lewis, president of the Life Settlement
Institute, a trade group that represents life settlement companies.</TE>
<TE>   House Banking Committee staffers said it was too soon to say
whether the committee would propose such legislation.</TE>

<HD>Sen. Grassley Proposes Bill to Protect Retirement Funds</HD>
<DH>401(k): Measure would encourage plan diversification, and
slap a 20% tax on some executive stock sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A top Senate Republican on Tuesday proposed new retirement-fund
protections that seek a middle ground between plans from the White
House and congressional Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, senior Republican on the Senate
Finance Committee, suggested a 20% tax on stock sales by executives
when other workers are prevented from selling shares in their 401(k)
retirement plan because of administrative restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   Grassley's bill also would give workers new vesting and
diversification rights, such as allowing them to sell company stock
after they've been with the company for three years. Currently,
companies can restrict matching contributions, such as by preventing
employees from selling company stock until they reach age 55 or have
10 years of service.</LD>
<TE>   The bill is designed to prevent a repeat of the situation at Enron
Corp., where employees lost an estimated $850 million in their
retirement accounts when the energy trader collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't allow what happened to Enron employees to happen to
other employees," Grassley said. "It could happen to other companies
in the future if Congress doesn't act."</TE>
<TE>   Grassley's plan is similar to proposals offered by President Bush.
Both would require a 30-day notice to workers before so-called
lockdown periods, when workers are barred from selling their stock.
Bush's plan also would require companies to allow employees to sell
company stock in their plans after three years.</TE>
<TE>   Bush didn't propose the 20% tax on executive stock sales. And
unlike Bush, Grassley wouldn't encourage companies to provide
investment advice to workers, saying this would present conflicts of
interest if the advisors didn't act in the employees' best interest.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of disagreement over how to get advice to the
workers who need help," Grassley said. Instead, he's urging
retirement education.</TE>
<TE>   Grassley's plan doesn't go as far as some Democrats' proposals,
such as a bill sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), which
would let workers hold no more than 20% of their retirement funds in
company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Grassley said he hasn't heard a reaction to his plan from Finance
Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.).</TE>

<HD>Union Decries Conditions at Pilgrim's Pride Chicken Plant</HD>
<DH>Labor: Federal complaint is filed to spotlight injury risk
for workers who make repetitive motions.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to call attention to an "epidemic" of repetitive-stress
injuries among blue-collar workers, a national labor union filed a
federal complaint Tuesday alleging hazardous working conditions at a
Pilgrim's Pride Corp. chicken plant in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint, filed with the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, was brought by the United Food and Commercial Workers
union, which successfully lobbied for federal ergonomics rules over
the last decade only to see them killed in the early days of the Bush
administration. Union officials said it is only the first salvo in a
campaign to force the government to address debilitating wrist,
shoulder and back pain in production work, particularly in industries
dominated by low-skilled immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   Poultry processing--in which workers make thousands of small,
repetitive motions in each shift--is the third-most dangerous job in
America, with one in five workers injured each year, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although overall injury rates have
dropped, those in poultry have climbed in recent years.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement, officials with Pilgrim's Pride said they had
worked hard to reduce injuries at the plant, which employs 1,150
workers in Lufkin, near the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   Federal rules aimed at reducing repetitive-motion injuries were
adopted in late 2000, but were repealed by Congress weeks later, with
encouragement from the new Bush administration. At the time, the
Department of Labor said more study was needed to justify
regulations. No new rules have been proposed since then, and
employers are no longer required to report such injuries separately.</TE>
<TE>   The union complaint was filed under the general-duty clause of
OSHA, which requires employers to provide a "safe and healthy
workplace free of recognized hazards." Jackie Nowell, director of the
union's safety and health office, said she visited the union plant
and met employees with debilitating pain and surgical scars.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen conditions like this in 20 years," she said. Many
workers were undocumented and afraid to complain, she said. "They
figure, 'If I just work through the pain, maybe everyone will leave
me alone.'"</TE>
<TE>   However, Jane Brookshire, senior vice president for human
relations at Pilgrim's Pride, said in the statement issued Tuesday,
"We emphasize early detection and intervention, provide training on
the correct way to perform each job, and when indicated, provide
appropriate medical care."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to union leaders at a meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday,
Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao said she will welcome the complaint
and take appropriate enforcement action.</TE>
<TE>   The union specifically asks for a team of OSHA doctors and
ergonomic specialists to analyze plant operations and to investigate
whether injuries have been properly reported. The administration has
six months to file charges, and the employer has 15 days to respond.
Then charges could be filed with an administrative law judge.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department's  chief attorney who would ultimately pursue
the case is Eugene Scalia. Scalia's appointment last month was
vigorously opposed by labor unions because of his position on
ergonomics, which he once termed "junk science." In an opinion
article, Scalia once wrote that labor unions favored ergonomic rules
because they would slow production lines and increase union jobs.</TE>
<TE>   A  Labor Department spokesman did not return calls seeking comment
on the status of ergonomic regulations or Scalia's position on such
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The UFCW filed a spate of OSHA general-duty complaints in the late
'80s aimed at repetitive-motion injuries in meatpacking plants. They
led to more than a dozen settlements, many in the millions of
dollars, and to congressional hearings. Eventually, OSHA adopted
special guidelines for meatpacking plants, and began work on
ergonomic regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Nowell said she expected a similar offensive now from the UFCW and
other unions. Her union is looking at several nonunion poultry
plants, she said.</TE>

<HD>Arraignment Put Off for Man Accused of Killing 5 Children</HD>
<DH>Court: Adair Garcia enters no plea. Pico Rivera plans
community counseling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a 30-year-old man charged with the poisoning deaths of five of his
children made his first court appearance Tuesday, Pico Rivera
officials planned a community counseling session today to help the
city overcome the tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   Adair Javier Garcia, who could face the death penalty if
convicted, did not enter a plea Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   His arraignment was reset for March 19 in Whittier Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia appeared puffy-eyed and never looked at the crowd, which
overflowed with media but included no family members.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Ruben Marquez objected to the media's
presence, saying that the pretrial publicity may endanger Garcia in
jail. However, Commissioner Louis Head allowed it.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Victor Rodriguez said he is unsure if his office will
seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 19, Garcia's mother-in-law arrived early in the morning to
care for the younger children and found the two-bedroom home on
Washington Boulevard filled with carbon monoxide fumes from a
smoldering barbecue grill in the living room.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, depressed over a failing marriage, had tucked his children
into bed and lighted the barbecue grill, which burned for hours, said
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Don Bear.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's wife, Adriana Arreola, had left the house at least a week
earlier, Bear said.</TE>
<TE>   Dead were Brenda, 10; Jonathan, 7; and Anthony, 2. Cecilia, 4,
died later that day, and Vanessa, 6, died one day later. Kassandra,
9, is expected to make a full recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, a splicing technician with SBC Pacific Bell in Rosemead,
was treated and released from a hospital before he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   None of the children has been buried, but some mortuaries have
offered their services free of charge, said Bob Spencer, the city's
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have offered grief counseling to anyone who needs
it today at the city's recreation community room at 6767 Passons
Blvd., Spencer said.</TE>
<TE>   The sessions are similar to ones held almost two years ago when
four members of another Pico Rivera family were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Flores, 39, and three of his children were stabbed to
death in the summer of 2000. Monica Diaz, Flores' adopted daughter,
and her boyfriend, Michael Naranjo, were arrested in those killings
and, after many court delays, are scheduled for arraignment on March
7.</TE>
<TE>   "Pico Rivera is the kind of community that if it hits anywhere in
the city, it affects everyone," Spencer said.</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins for Man Accused in Triple Slaying</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutor tells jurors that all but one bullet
fired at the party came from Juan Guillen's gun. Defense attorney
says a detective coerced witnesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two ballistics experts will testify that 15 of 16 bullets fired at a
birthday party in Arleta where three people died came from a gun
belonging to Juan Guillen, a prosecutor said Tuesday in opening
statements of Guillen's trial.</LD>
<LD>   Guillen, 26, is charged with three counts of murder and one count
of attempted murder in the Jan. 14, 2001, deaths of members of the
Pacoima Pacatrece gang.</LD>
<LD>   He pleaded not guilty last year to killing Joel Gonzalez, 27, of
Arleta; Jesse Abel, 24, of Pacoima; and Jack Loutsios, 17, of Mission
Hills.</LD>
<TE>   He also denied wounding German Lopez, 21, during the party in a
residential backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels told jurors in San Fernando
Superior Court that the shootings occurred after Guillen argued with
Abel. Samuels said 16 shell casings were found in the yard and in the
alley behind the house where Richard Torres was celebrating his 17th
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   The ballistics experts from the Los Angeles Police Department will
testify that 15 of the bullets were shot from Guillen's gun, the
prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   She urged jurors to treat testimony from gang members who were at
the party with the same consideration as other witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to get a lot of bankers up there," Samuels said.
"You're going to have a lot of gang members up there, because that's
who was at the party."</TE>
<TE>   Guillen's attorney, Nancy Mazza, told jurors that gang members
should not be taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to listen to gang members, gang members usually
prosecuted," she said. "These are punks. They have rap sheets; they
lie to the police."</TE>
<TE>   Mazza said Guillen was hired to be a disc jockey at the party and
had abandoned gang life five years ago to live with his wife and two
children in Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors who lived across the alley will testify that they heard
several gunshots coming from various directions, showing that there
was more than one gunman involved, Mazza said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Los Angeles police have said Guillen turned himself in
last year after fleeing to Mexico, Mazza said Guillen and his
26-year-old wife, Maria, went to Tijuana after the shootings to drop
off their daughter for a visit with Guillen's mother.</TE>
<TE>   The couple left Mexico, Mazza said, when police called Guillen for
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't flee as they're saying he did," Maria Guillen said
outside the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Mazza said she will prove that LAPD Det. Jose Martinez coerced
witnesses into naming Guillen as the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   She said Lopez, who was shot in the face, will testify today that
he was on medication when Martinez interviewed him in the hospital.
Mazza said interviewing a witness under medication violates police
protocol.</TE>
<TE>   "Det. Martinez is to be looked at very carefully," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Family members of the slain men sat in the back of the courtroom
as the opposing attorneys presented their case.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to know what happened," said Gonzalez's father,
Manuel.</TE>

<HD>Burbank Mayor Quits to Become Ombudsman</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burbank City Manager Bud Ovrom reviewed 16 applicants for the job of
city ombudsman. The man he ultimately hired happened to be his own
boss.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Kramer, who used to help evaluate Ovrom's performance,
resigned as Burbank's mayor Monday to take the less-prestigious but
better-paying gig.</LD>
<LD>   "I was fair to Bud," said Kramer, 55, a retired painting
contractor whose mayoral term would have expired next year. "So now I
hope he's fair to me."</LD>
<TE>   The ombudsman job pays $3,965 to $4,817 a month (Ovrom declined to
reveal Kramer's exact salary). That's a big jump from the roughly
$1,000 monthly stipend Kramer received for his part-time work on the
City Council, which rotates the mayoralty.</TE>
<TE>   Ovrom and City Atty. Dennis Barlow said no favoritism was involved
with Kramer, who went through the normal hiring process.</TE>

<HD>Eagles' Songwriters File Lawsuit Claiming Royalties
Underpayment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three musicians who composed some of the Eagles' most popular
songs--"Peaceful Easy Feeling," "Take It Easy," "Best of My Love" and
"Already Gone"--contend in a lawsuit against their music publisher
that they have been shortchanged millions of dollars in royalties
from a 1975 album that "is now the largest-selling record of all
time."</LD>
<LD>   Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther and Jack Tempchin's suit, filed in
Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks punitive damages from
Warner/Chappell Music Inc., which acquired their original publishing
companies and then allegedly entered a "sweetheart" deal with an
affiliate to license songs for "Eagles: Their Greatest Hits
1971-1974."</LD>
<LD>   According to the suit, royalties negotiated on behalf of two band
members--co-founders Don Henley and Glenn Frey--were higher than
those for the songwriters with whom the group collaborated. The
songwriters were unaware of the discrepancy for more than 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   According to the court papers, the Eagles greatest hits album has
sold more than 26 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   The songwriters' attorney, Lawrence Y. Iser, said that each time a
song was used for commercial purposes, his clients have been paid
2cents, the legally approved rate in 1975. Even then, according to
the suit, the songwriters should have been making 2.4cents under an
agreement their publisher  struck with Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch
Records. But no one told them about the increase or that their
royalties would be locked in.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Iser said, the going rate is about 7.5 cents per song--a
differential his clients deserve.</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancies were discovered during an audit commissioned by
Tempchin  in the late 1990s, the lawyer added.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Warner/ Chappell, now a unit of AOL Time
Warner Inc., did not respond to a request for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks unspecified damages for breach of contract, breach
of good faith and breach of fiduciary duty. The songwriters claim to
have lost more than $10 million in royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Tempchin composed "Peaceful Easy Feeling" and co-wrote "Already
Gone." Souther co-wrote "Best of My Love" with Henley and Frey, and
Browne co-wrote "Take It Easy" with Frey.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint statement, the songwriters said: "It is with deep
regret that we file this lawsuit, but we are left with no
alternative. All of our efforts to amicably resolve the matter with
Warner/Chappell have been ignored. We are still hopeful the matter
can be resolved in good faith."</TE>

<HD>Execs Square Off in Enron Testimony</HD>
<DH>RELATED STORY Policy: Energy regulators sought advice from
Enron even after it disclosed financial problems. C7</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a confrontation between accuser and accused, Enron Corp. Vice
President Sherron S. Watkins told Congress on Tuesday that former
Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling must have known about the
company's financial troubles, while Skilling maintained that he was
unaware of accounting improprieties.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, former Enron Treasurer Ben F. Glisan--who reportedly
pocketed $1 million by investing $5,800 in the company's
off-the-books partnerships--has begun cooperating with the Justice
Department, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
Glisan is believed to be the first Enron executive to attempt to
trade his inside knowledge of the company's affairs for softer
treatment by law enforcement investigators.</LD>
<LD>   "They think he's the best guy so far that they can flip," said a
source familiar with the criminal probe.</LD>
<TE>   At the Tuesday hearing, Skilling, whose earlier testimony before a
House panel was greeted with skepticism from lawmakers, denied lying
to Congress during 5 1/2 hours of grilling before the Senate Commerce
Committee. In a classic he-said-she-said duel, Skilling and
Watkins--seated at the same table and separated by only Skilling's
attorney--disputed each other's account of what led to the largest
bankruptcy in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not lied to the Congress or anyone else about my
recollection of events while I was at Enron," Skilling said.</TE>
<TE>   But Watkins said, "I believe that Mr. Andy Fastow would not have
put his hands in the Enron candy jar without an explicit or implicit
approval to do so by Mr. Skilling."</TE>
<TE>   Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer and a Skilling
protege, is regarded as the architect of the off-the-books
partnerships that investigators say were used to hide Enron's losses.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, Mr. Skilling was aware of the problems," Watkins
told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   "How would she know that?" Skilling responded at a later point.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling also expanded briefly on the reasons for his resignation
after six months as chief executive last summer, saying he was
"tired" and didn't enjoy the job.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, who wrote to former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in
August, warning that the company was about to "implode in a wave of
accounting scandals," also sharply criticized Lay, whom she had
defended in testimony to a House panel two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I was incredibly frustrated with Mr. Lay's actions or lack
thereof," she told senators Tuesday. "I believe that Enron had a
brief window to salvage itself this past fall, and we missed that
opportunity because of Mr. Lay's failure to recognize or accept that
the company had manipulated its financial statements."</TE>
<TE>   Lay and Fastow have declined to testify, invoking the right
against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his drubbing before a House panel earlier this month,
Skilling showed no signs of being humbled or intimidated Tuesday,
frequently sparring with lawmakers, correcting, interrupting and
occasionally chastising them.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling also revealed a greater familiarity with the details of
the partnerships than he disclosed in his earlier testimony, saying
he was aware the Raptor partnerships were being supported by Enron
stock and required outside investors to make the accounting treatment
allowable. In his previous testimony, Skilling suggested that he was
unaware of or could not remember many of the details of the
partnerships' transactions.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, after Skilling lectured lawmakers about the
difference between a "naked hedge" and "low-collateral hedge," Sen.
Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D) quipped: "You seem to know more about
accounting and finance than you let on."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling said he relied on the advice of Enron accountant Andersen
to ensure that the structure of the partnerships was appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the accountants had told me that they thought this was
an appropriate structure, I felt comfortable with it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's current President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey
McMahon testified he brought concerns to Skilling about conflicts of
interest involving subordinates of Fastow negotiating on behalf of
Enron with partnerships in which Fastow had a financial interest.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon said Fastow's role in the partnerships "created conflicts
... because [Fastow] had a very large impact on their compensation,
on their promotion capabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling claims McMahon was largely concerned about his bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Glisan, who was fired in November, may be able to fill in many of
the holes in the Enron story and resolve some of the conflicting
statements made by Enron officers. He also may be in a position to
give criminal investigators information that could be used against
some of his former bosses, including Lay, Skilling and Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   Glisan has refused to comment publicly about his role in Enron's
demise. His signature appears on several company documents involving
the partnership deals that eventually caused the company to file for
bankruptcy. He replaced McMahon as treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   According to the special internal investigation conducted by
Enron's board of directors after the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, Glisan
was among several company insiders who profited by investing in those
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether Glisan has been, or will be, offered
immunity in exchange for his cooperation. Justice Department
officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But his assistance was considered so valuable that the FBI asked
at least one congressional committee to refrain from calling Glisan
as a witness, which might have compromised his usefulness to the
investigation, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.) declined to comment on any
contacts with the FBI, but said, "Obviously Mr. Glisan, as treasurer
of the company, is in good position to know a lot about who knew what
and when they knew."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood said the House subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, which he chairs, had invited Glisan to testify, but
was informed by Glisan's attorney that he would refuse to talk under
the 5th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing Tuesday, Skilling strongly denounced his critics.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire management and board of Enron has been labeled
everything from hucksters to criminals, with a complete disregard for
the facts and evidence assembled," he said. "Common decency suggests
that I be treated as innocent until proven
otherwise....Unfortunately, neither common decency nor common sense
will carry the day in this politicized process."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.) praised Skilling for not succumbing
to the "5th Amendment fever" that has kept other former Enron
executives from testifying, but scoffed at suggestions that Enron's
troubles were solely the result of a rogue chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't buy it," Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   Senators also grilled Skilling about his reasons for resigning
after just six months as CEO.</TE>
<TE>   "You had spent a decade working your way up through the company to
this pinnacle of power," Sen. Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.) said. "It looks
suspiciously as if you realized that the company was coming apart and
you jumped ship."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling insisted that he stepped down for personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "To be quite frank, I was tired," he said. "This may be the
perfect job for some people. It was not the perfect job for me."</TE>
<TE>   But Skilling said he was so concerned about the company's future
that he called Lay in late October and offered to return to the
company at no salary.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing extended beyond Enron's collapse to a joke that
Skilling made last year during California energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   He was repeatedly excoriated by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who
held up a placard with the joke: "You know what the difference is
between the state of California and the Titanic? At least when the
Titanic went down, the lights were on."</TE>
<TE>   "That comment does not sit well with the people of California,"
Boxer told Skilling. "And clearly, the Titanic was not California. It
turned out to be your company."</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Sees 'Significant Loss'</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Fourth- quarter and full-year earnings report is
delayed. Available cash is down to $700 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. disclosed Tuesday it has burned through $50
million a week since it filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy in U.S.
history last month, making its restructuring more urgent.</LD>
<LD>   The troubled telecommunications firm said it has about $700
million of available cash in its bank accounts, down from $900
million when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan.
28. The company, which had $2.2 billion in cash at the end of
September, assured investors and employees late last year that it had
enough cash on hand to operate through the end of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   For creditors, the company's cash holdings are important because
they will help determine how much money is available to fund a
reorganization. Creditors are owed at least $12.4 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Global Crossing said it expects to report "a significant net
loss'' for the fourth quarter and full year, which will include at
least an additional $10 billion in noncash write-offs.</TE>
<TE>   The company planned to report fourth-quarter and full-year
financial results for 2001 Tuesday. Instead, it released "unaudited
estimates of revenue" because its auditor, Andersen, is still
reviewing financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing said it would release its complete financial
results when it files its annual report with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. A company spokesman said it's not clear when
that will happen.</TE>
<TE>   The company's Asia Global Crossing subsidiary, which is not part
of the bankruptcy filing, also reported preliminary revenue for its
fourth quarter and full year, and warned that it expects to record a
"material" loss for the fourth quarter and for the year and that
Andersen probably will question the company's ability to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue from continuing operations at the parent company was
approximately $804 million during the last three months of 2001.
Comparable figures for the same quarter a year earlier were not
available, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's fourth-quarter estimates include revenue of $764
million from corporate customers using its vast undersea fiber-optic
network. That figure excludes the effect of the company's
controversial swapping of capacity on that network with other
carriers. Exchanges of the so-called indefeasible rights of use, or
IRUs, between Global Crossing and rival carriers have come under fire
from regulators and investors because they can inflate revenue.</TE>
<TE>   For the full year, revenue from continuing operations was
approximately $3.2 billion, including $100 million from IRUs, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   But that will be more than offset by billions of dollars in new
write-downs. In addition to about $3 billion in charges previously
reported, Global Crossing said Tuesday it expects to write off about
$8 billion in goodwill and other intangible assets, along with
billions more for the declining value of tangible assets, such as its
network.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing said fourth-quarter revenue, excluding IRUs,
rose more than threefold, to $46.7 million. Annual revenue excluding
IRUs soared 328% to $121.5 million. Global Crossing owns 59% of Asia
Global Crossing. Both firms are based in Bermuda, with executive
offices in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing shares gained 3 cents, to 36 cents, in
Tuesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The financial results
were announced after the markets closed.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators at the SEC and the FBI are now sifting through
documents for proof of any wrongdoing by Global Crossing. The SEC has
subpoenaed documents from Global Crossing, Qwest Communications
International Inc., Velocita Corp., and 360Networks, which also is
operating under bankruptcy protection. Velocita's executive chairman
is Robert Annunziata, one of Global Crossing's four former chief
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Chief Executive John Legere praised his embattled
employees for keeping the company going amid an industry-wide
meltdown and a barrage of negative publicity about company
executives' pay, stock sales and potential conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Tuesday, Global Crossing named Carl Grivner chief
operating officer, reviving a position that was eliminated in
October. Grivner previously served as the company's executive vice
president of global operations.</TE>
<TE>   As operating chief, he will continue to oversee global operations,
as well as product management and some sales and marketing functions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the company said director Mark Attanasio has resigned
from the board and that it plans to recruit more outside directors.</TE>

<CX>   Global Crossing--Global Crossing Ltd.'s available cash increased by
$100 million from Jan. 28 to Feb. 25. A story in Wednesday's Business
section incorrectly reported that it had declined by $200 million. A
Wednesday story about Global Crossing's 401(k) plan incorrectly reported
that the company's bankruptcy is the fifth-largest in U.S. history. It is
the fourth-largest. In addition, a Sunday story about Global Crossing's
board of directors incorrectly stated that former director Norman
Brownstein is a childhood friend of Global Crossing Chairman Gary
Winnick. In fact, the two have known each other for about 15 years.</CX>

From its launch five years ago, Homestore.com, the Internetearss largest
provider of home-sale listings, basked in the glow of Wall Street
adulation and prospered from the strong support of Realtors and
advertisers nationwide. Consistently outperforming industry
expectations, the Westlake Village company appeared successful even
as many other dot-coms collapsed.
As recently as late summer, the company was touted as an Internet
powerhouse, with its lock of 90% of the countryearss home listings, and
its exclusive contracts with multiple-listing services. Wall Street
was convinced the company had staying power.</SN>

<HD>Homestore's New Management Trying to Put House in Order</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the dot-com universe of the late 1990s, most companies were built
on inflated hope and little else.</LD>
<LD>   But Homestore.com was supposed to be different. Founded in 1996 by
Stuart H. Wolff, an electrical engineer by training, the Westlake
Village-based firm quickly became the biggest provider of home-sale
listings on the Web.</LD>
<LD>   It was a service the public--and real estate agents--seemed to
want and need. By 2000, the potential power of Homestore's franchise
loomed so large that the company became the target of a government
antitrust probe.</LD>
<TE>   Today, like so many remaining dot-com firms, Homestore is
struggling for its life. It has warned shareholders not to rely on
its financial statements for 2000 and 2001 because those figures will
be restated. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
the company, and Nasdaq is threatening to delist its stock.</TE>
<TE>   As with the collapse of Enron Corp., Homestore executives, led by
Wolff, are accused of falsifying financial results and enriching
themselves at other shareholders' expense.</TE>
<TE>   But for the new management team attempting to right the firm, the
most urgent question may be whether home listings, like so many other
aspects of commerce, simply don't constitute a profitable enterprise
on the Internet--or at least, not as Homestore envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Agents Allege Strong-Arm Tactics</TE>
<TE>   The new management team, headed by three former WebMD Corp.
executives, including new Chief Executive Michael Long, acknowledges
that it is facing defections by disgruntled real estate brokers--some
of whom contend they were strong-armed into buying additional
services from Homestore to have their names and phone numbers
prominently displayed on the firm's Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Some agents also say their Homestore listings aren't generating
the sales they expected.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, home seekers flock to Homestore's Web sites. As home
sales surged nationwide in January, the company's combined Wen sites
attracted about 13.7 million visitors, nearly double the number of
hits recorded a year earlier, according to Internet analyst Jupiter
Media Metrix.</TE>
<TE>   Long, 49, is refocusing Homestore and expects the business to be
"cash-flow positive" this year, meaning the firm's survival wouldn't
depend on outside financing--a critical issue for a company whose
shares last traded Tuesday at 87 cents apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a smaller company than last year but still a substantial
one," Long said. "We're contacting customers to see what the issues
are and what we can do to take corrective action to make them
happier. It will take some time."</TE>
<TE>   Some investors and Wall Street analysts view the company's
prospects more skeptically.</TE>
<TE>   The California State Teachers' Retirement System, which has asked
to be the lead plaintiff in shareholder suits against Homestore, said
it has little hope of recovering the $9 million it lost on Homestore
stock and isn't sure the company can survive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Homestore got its start in 1996, when Internet businesses such as
Homeseekers.com began putting listings of houses for sale, once the
sole domain of brokers and agents, on their Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff, a Princeton University-educated electrical engineer, saw
the potential business opportunity in online real estate and quickly
raised $7 million from investors to forge a partnership with the
National Assn. of Realtors, the brokerage industry's principal trade
group. NAR had attempted, but failed, to start its own real estate
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of Wolff's deal, his company, RealSelect Inc.,
took over the operation of NAR's Realtor.com, and NAR took a 4%
ownership stake in RealSelect. RealSelect quickly signed up real
estate agencies representing about 90% of the nation's listings of
homes for sale.</TE>
<TE>   By July 1998, Realtor.com was the dominant Internet site for home
shoppers, boasting 1.2 million listings supplied by brokers in all 50
states.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1999, RealSelect Inc., now called Homestore.com, sold 7
million shares of stock in an initial public offering at $20 apiece,
raising $140 million. The company had amassed more than twice the
number of home listings of its closest competitor, HomeAdvisor.com.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore by then also operated HomeBuilder.com, focusing on
new-home sales, SpringStreet .com, with millions of apartment
listings, and CommercialSource .com, a listing service for the
commercial real estate industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Homestore was a very positive force in a trillion-dollar market,"
said Shawn Milne, a Wall Street analyst with SoundView Technologies
Group. "In 1997, 2% of consumers searched online for home listings.
Now, 55% go online first. They cornered a good market."</TE>
<TE>   Wolff's vision was for Homestore to derive revenue from two
sources: fees paid by listing agents for assorted services, and ads
on the sites from housing-related advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore's listing-exclusivity agreements with local realty
boards were perhaps its strongest selling point for investors and
helped drive the stock to a peak of $138 in January 2000. Yet the
deals also drew sharp criticism in the industry and scrutiny from
regulators concerned that the agreements stifled competition.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's antitrust unit opened an investigation in
April 2000 into Homestore's business practices, which prevented other
sites from using the same listings. More than a year later, however,
the government terminated its probe without taking action.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the financial data Homestore was reporting to
shareholders showed a company growing at a dramatic pace. Reported
revenue jumped from $11 million in the second quarter of 1999 to
$50million in the same period of 2000 and $129 million in the same
period of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding what the company said were one-time charges, Homestore
claimed to be profitable: It said "pro forma" earnings totaled $14.5
million in the second quarter of last year, or 13 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Homestore shares began to slide in late summer, and
the decline accelerated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Oct. 3, the company stunned investors by announcing that
third-quarter results would fall below analysts' estimates. Homestore
blamed a drop in ad revenue, which Wolff said was partly attributed
to the terrorist attacks. But analysts now say the company was losing
ground well before that.</TE>
<TE>   "Management hoped they could keep building, keep growing through
quarters when advertising revenue wasn't," said Safa Rashtchy, an
analyst at brokerage U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "They were looking
for an excuse, and Sept. 11 gave them an excuse. But they already
knew they were in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   What investors didn't discover until late last year was that
Homestore was relying heavily on barter arrangements with certain
advertisers to beef up revenue. These so-called round-trip deals were
transactions in which ads were exchanged not for cash but for goods
and services, the value of which Homestore apparently overstated,
said Jay Leupp, senior equity analyst at brokerage Robertson
Stephens.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 21, the company disclosed that its board of directors was
conducting an internal investigation of its accounting practices. On
Jan. 2, Homestore said it had overstated revenue in the first nine
months of 2001 by as much as $95million. The company had reported
revenue of $351 million in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week later, Wolff resigned.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 13, Homestore said it also would restate its 2000
financial results. And on Feb. 21, the company raised its estimate of
the 2001 revenue overstatement to as much as $113 million. Homestore
said it expects to conclude its internal financial inquiry by
mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   Now, nearly 20 class-action lawsuits accuse Homestore, Wolff and
his top executives of faking revenue to prop up the firm's stock so
they could sell as much as $27.9 million worth of their own shares.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore has declined to comment on the lawsuits. Wolff could not
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Long, as yet unable to tell Wall Street what the company's true
financial picture was in 2000 and 2001, is stressing his game plan
for the future: Advertising will play a smaller role in generating
revenue; agent and broker service subscriptions and sales of software
will play a more prominent role, he said. (The latter already
accounted for 61% of revenue as of mid-2001, according to the
company's previous statements.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Homestore is in the process of exiting businesses that
don't relate to its "core constituents," primarily agents, brokers
and home builders. But holding on to that constituency may be Long's
biggest challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Some agents complain that after providing listings to Homestore,
they were pressured into paying for the company's special services,
including the prominent display of their names and phone numbers on
the firm's sites. Several Realtors described the fee they were forced
to pay, up to $1,100 a year, as a "shakedown."</TE>
<TE>   "I subscribed to [Homestore's services] because I realized it was
the only way my name would appear on the listing," said Diane
Scarfuto, an agent at ReMax Real Estate Specialists in Long Beach who
canceled her Homestore subscription last month. "If I treated my
customers the way they treated us, I wouldn't be in business."</TE>
<TE>   Homestore expected a renewal rate of about 70% among subscribers,
but a recent survey conducted by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray revealed
a projected renewal rate among brokers of 30% to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Some multiple-listing services, which are paid $1 per exclusive
listing by Homestore, also are threatening to end their contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, for example, is
"teetering on the brink" of canceling its contract because the
service is receiving only half the fees Homestore promised to pay,
said Tina Griffin, executive director of the service. "We want to see
Homestore succeed, but they can't on the backs of their members. If
we don't see them taking our interests to heart, we won't renew."</TE>
<TE>   Homestore has told some of the listings services that it will
continue to pay the $1-per-listing fee as long as it can, but the
company may not be able to do so beyond this year. As of Dec. 31,
Homestore said it had $48 million in cash on hand.</TE>
<TE>   The company also faces another large potential liability: In 2000,
Homestore entered a marketing partnership with AOL Time Warner Inc.,
in which Homestore pledged to pay AOL $20 million in cash and 3.9
million shares of Homestore stock over the course of four years.
Homestore guaranteed its shares would be worth $68.50, but in the
event they weren't, the firm would pay the difference, according to
Salomon Smith Barney analyst Lanny Baker.</TE>
<TE>   That agreement could cost Homestore up to $90 million.</TE>
<TE>   Long said Homestore set aside $90 million from the beginning of
its relationship with AOL to cover such an eventuality.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Market Appears to</TE>
<TE>   Have Given Up Hope</TE>
<TE>   Although Homestore still enjoys the support of the National Assn.
of Realtors, some agents claim they receive few leads from
Homestore-run Realtor.com.</TE>
<TE>   "I subscribed to Realtor.com in the beginning, for a year, then
gave it up," said Joe DiTore of ReMax Real Estate Specialists in Long
Beach. "I wasn't getting any business from it."</TE>
<TE>   Long said he is aggressively addressing agents' complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried about subscribers who aren't renewing, so we're
pursuing why and adjusting our product accordingly," Long said.
"We've instituted a customer-advocacy program that will find out what
our customers' issues are and to help us take corrective action."</TE>
<TE>   But the financial cloud over Homestore has analysts and investors
questioning whether Long's rescue plan can succeed. With the stock at
87 cents, the market appears to have given up hope.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say Homestore could be acquired by one of its
competitors, such as HomeAdvisor or HomeGain. Others say Yahoo Inc.
or EBay Inc., which could benefit from Homestore's technology and
market penetration, might be interested in bidding once the company's
financial situation is clearer.</TE>
<TE>   But some also question whether a takeover offer is possible. "If I
were looking to buy Homestore, I'd wonder whether I could build it
myself," Salomon's Baker</TE>
<TE>   said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Employees Questioned on 401(k) Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Labor Department is questioning former Global Crossing Ltd.
workers about the bankrupt company's 401(k) retirement plan,
apparently to determine if any pension laws were broken.</LD>
<LD>   Former Global Crossing employees said this week they have been
contacted by Labor Department investigators, who asked for copies of
documents distributed to workers describing the company's 401(k) plan
and its features.</LD>
<LD>   The investigators "said that they were opening an investigation
into Global Crossing's 401(k) program and [were] very interested in
any additional information that they could glean from any present or
former employee," said one former employee, who asked not to be
identified.</LD>
<TE>   Global Crossing workers lost about $250 million between 1999 and
2001 when the value of the company stock in their 401(k) accounts
tumbled from a peak of $64 to 30 cents before the company filed the
fifth-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   A Global Crossing spokeswoman said the company had been contacted
by Labor Department investigators and was cooperating.</TE>
<TE>   "Our [attorneys] will work to provide all necessary information
and answer any questions [investigators] may have," said spokeswoman
Janis Burenga.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department routinely examines the retirement plans of
companies that have filed for bankruptcy to make sure  employees'
retirement money is safe and being properly distributed as companies
reorganize, said department spokeswoman Gloria Della. Della would
neither confirm nor deny that such an investigation was taking place
at Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   The telecom giant, which is based in Bermuda and has executive
offices in Beverly Hills, is  under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the FBI for its accounting methods. In
addition, members of Congress have demanded investigations into the
company's retirement plans, and employees have sued over losses in
their 401(k) accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing employees said labor investigators also questioned
them about the company's severance packages. Global Crossing cut off
severance pay to thousands of laid-off workers when it filed for
bankruptcy, but in the preceding months forgave loans and made $15
million in lump-sum pension payments to certain executives.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators simply may be making sure employee contributions were
deposited into the 401(k) plan, said Los Angeles pension lawyer Alex
Brucker. Troubled companies sometimes illegally use 401(k)
contributions to pay bills, although such behavior is far more common
at small, private companies than at large, publicly traded firms,
pension lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokeswoman Tisha Kresler said all employee
contributions have been properly deposited in the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Labor investigators also may be probing whether employees were
advised of the risks of investing in company stock, which at one
point made up more than half the 401(k) plan's assets, pension
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) asked the Labor Department last
week to determine whether any of the trustees of Global Crossing's
savings plan were aware of the company's financial problems and what
steps the trustees took, if any, to protect employees.</TE>
<TE>   Miller also plans to introduce a bill today that would require
executives who sell company stock to alert company employees and
pension officials within 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter (D-N.Y.) has requested a
congressional inquiry into Global Crossing's decision to freeze
workers' 401(k) accounts for a month before the bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   This legal but controversial practice, known as a lockdown, was
used by both Global Crossing and bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp.
when the companies switched plan administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers have introduced bills that would limit how long
lockdowns can last.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's stock already had lost 99% of its value by the
time its lockdown began Dec. 14.  Global Crossing's 401(k) plan was
typical for a large firm, offering a range of investment options
including stock and bond mutual funds as well as company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Both firms matched their employees' contributions only with shares
of company stock, however, and placed restrictions on workers'
ability to sell those shares. Consumer and pension rights advocates
say such restrictions--also not uncommon among employers--prevented
many employees from diversifying their accounts.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Global Crossing lifted restrictions on employees'
ability to sell company shares in their 401(k)--long after most of
the shares' value had disappeared. Even then, many employees did not
sell their shares, saying they were told by executives that the stock
price would recover.</TE>

<CX>   Global Crossing--Global Crossing Ltd.'s available cash increased by
$100 million from Jan. 28 to Feb. 25. A story in Wednesday's Business
section incorrectly reported that it had declined by $200 million. A
Wednesday story about Global Crossing's 401(k) plan incorrectly reported
that the company's bankruptcy is the fifth-largest in U.S. history. It is
the fourth-largest. In addition, a Sunday story about Global Crossing's
board of directors incorrectly stated that former director Norman
Brownstein is a childhood friend of Global Crossing Chairman Gary
Winnick. In fact, the two have known each other for about 15 years.</CX>

<HD>Tobacco Firms Smuggled Into Iraq, EU Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: Documents in lawsuit accuse cigarette makers of
violating U.S. trade embargo for more than a decade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tobacco companies have violated a U.S. trade embargo for more than a
decade by illegally sending billions of cigarettes into Iraq, the
European Union has charged.</LD>
<LD>   The allegation is detailed in documents recently filed in federal
court in Brooklyn, where the European Union has accused tobacco firms
of evading hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes by taking part in
a vast cigarette smuggling scheme.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraq charge focuses on two companies, R.J. Reynolds and Japan
Tobacco Inc., which acquired Reynolds' international cigarette
business in 1999. But an affidavit filed in court also claims that in
December a witness saw Philip Morris brands being trucked from Turkey
into Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. trade with Iraq was outlawed in August 1990 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. The embargo covers not only direct shipments but
also transshipments of goods through third countries, according to
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a branch of the Treasury
Department. Violations carry stiff criminal and civil penalties.</TE>
<TE>   It could not immediately be determined whether U.S. authorities
are looking into the EU's claims.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury in North Carolina has been investigating
whether R.J. Reynolds was involved in European smuggling activities.
Peter Kellen, an assistant U.S. attorney in Raleigh, said the
investigation is "still pending."</TE>
<TE>   Kellen would not say whether the Iraq allegations are part of the
probe. A Treasury spokeswoman also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Seth Moskowitz, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., denied
that the firm "has been involved in smuggling activity in Europe or
elsewhere," calling the allegations "unsupportable and untrue."
Officials with Japan Tobacco could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi charge was laid out this month in hundreds of pages of
pleadings and exhibits in a last-ditch attempt to keep the EU suit
from being thrown out. But last week, U.S. District Judge Nicholas G.
Garaufis dismissed the case and a similar anti-smuggling case filed
by 22 Colombian states.</TE>
<TE>   Garaufis did not address the Iraq allegation in a ruling narrowly
based on the "revenue rule," a common-law doctrine that prevents U.S.
courts from being used to collect foreign taxes. However, the judge
said the EU and the Colombian states may refile some claims,
including money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   The EU charged that despite trade sanctions, Reynolds throughout
the 1990s had knowingly sent billions of its cigarettes into Iraq
through intermediaries. The cigarettes allegedly traveled from a
Reynolds plant in Puerto Rico to European ports and then were
re-routed through Cyprus to Turkey to be trucked over the border into
Iraq. According to court papers, Japan Tobacco took over the trade
when it acquired Reynolds' international business in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In support of the charge, the EU filed an affidavit by Tugrul
Ozsengul, a Turkish security consultant who said he witnessed the
shipments on a visit to the border region in December.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the Habur border gate of Turkey with Iraq, and I
witnessed that Winston cigarettes [sold overseas by Japan Tobacco]
and Philip Morris brand cigarettes were being shipped across the
border into Iraq," Ozsengul said. "I questioned people working and
living in the area about these shipments and learned that almost
every day lorries, mainly of the above-mentioned brands, have been
shipped to Iraq, and this situation has persisted for several years."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the EU also filed a copy of a suit by an Iranian
businessman who accused Reynolds and a Cypriot tobacco distributor of
reneging on an agreement to give him the exclusive right to supply
the Iraqi market.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1997 lawsuit, filed in Limassol, Cyprus, Abdel Hamid
Damirji said he began sending Reynolds brands into Iraq from Amman,
Jordan, about 1990. Damirji said that routing became impossible, and
that with Reynolds' approval he spent nearly $1 million to build and
equip two warehouses in Turkey to continue the Iraqi trade.</TE>
<TE>   But though Damirji was to be the "sole and exclusive supplier" of
cigarettes to Iraq, in the mid-1990s Reynolds and a Cypriot
distributor, IBCS Trading, began diverting part of the Iraqi business
to two other wholesalers, Damirji claimed.</TE>
<TE>   In response, IBCS acknowledged being a distributor for Reynolds
but denied violating a contract with Damirji. Reynolds' response and
the resolution of the suit could not be determined.</TE>
<TE>   EU lawyers also claimed that a portion of the proceeds from the
Iraqi shipments may have aided terrorists. They described a document
filed under seal as showing that the Kurdistan Workers' Party,
classified by the U.S. as a terrorist group, was linked to the
cigarette trade. They also cited widely publicized claims by a Iraqi
defector that Uday Hussein, son of Iraq's ruler, Saddam Hussein,
controls illicit trade in cigarettes and other goods.</TE>
<TE>   In response, tobacco lawyers accused the EU of trying "to pollute
these proceedings" with "bizarre" submissions and "hyperbolic
rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   Invoking terrorism was an attempt by the EU to give the judge a
reason not to decide the case on the revenue rule.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which sits above
Garaufis, found that the rule does apply to such cases. In its
ruling, the 2nd Circuit upheld the dismissal of Canada's $1-billion
smuggling suit against Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a Reynolds subsidiary, Northern Brands Inc., paid
$15million and pleaded guilty to U.S. charges stemming from cigarette
smuggling. The case involved Canadian cigarettes exported duty-free
into upstate New York and then smuggled back to Canada.</TE>

<LD>That's no misprint on the L.A. County sample ballot. Assessor
candidate John Loew's middle names really are a campaign statement
(see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   I checked with the registrar's office and was told that since Loew
had had his name legally changed to include "Lower Taxes," he could
put that mouthful on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   I wanted to ask him if he had considered "John Loew Taxes" but was
unable to contact him.</LD>
<TE>   Loew's tactic reminded me of a San Francisco singer who ran for
president as Nobody a couple of decades ago. When he would appear in
public, he would shout things like, "Who understands economic
policy?" and his followers would yell back, "Nobody!"</TE>
<TE>   He never did get his name on any ballots, though, and hardly
anybody voted for Nobody.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The customer's always wrong? Lee Scott of Ontario saw a flier for
a restaurant where diners evidently can expect to be insulted. George
Barnes, a Van Nuys sales manager, meanwhile, received a
"to-whom-it-may-concern" note from a company that sounded as though
it weren't on the up and up (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poodles need not attend: The animal rescue group New Leash on Life
will hold what it calls the first-ever Mutt Dog Show and Fair at
Calabasas High on March 10 (information: 818-710-9898), and I say
it's about time.</TE>
<TE>   At last an event for mutts--real dogs, not pampered robots. I
trust there will be best-in-show awards for Oddest Markings, Most
Peculiar Shape, Floppiest Ears, Crookedest Tail, Best Car Chaser and
the category for which my late pooch, Hank, would have won paws down:
Ripper-Upper of Bedroom Slippers.</TE>

<TE>   Trojangate: I was seized by feelings of nostalgia when I read in
The Times about the theft of more than 2,000 copies of USC's Daily
Trojan, a crime that was linked to the newspaper's coverage of
student elections.</TE>
<TE>   I felt that way because thousands of Daily Trojans containing
election endorsements were stolen when I attended USC, almost four
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, my DT colleague, Greg McAndrews, recalls three mass
thefts of Daily Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   USC's student government, of course, later became known as a sort
of training ground for Watergate figures, including H.R. Haldeman,
Ronald Ziegler, Dwight Chapin, Donald Segretti and Gordon Strachan.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the dirty tricks during USC elections over the last 60
years have included spreading manure around polling places to
discourage women from voting, Chicago-style ballot box stuffing that
caused a 1989 election to be invalidated, and the alleged wiretapping
of a Senate candidate's rival.</TE>
<TE>   As my late journalism prof, Fred Coonradt, used to say: "Every
year at USC is a Watergate."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The Palm Beach (Fla.) Post recently ran a good-natured
correction in which it admitted that, "because of knucklehead
errors," it had mixed up Curly Howard and Curly Joe DeRita of the
Three Stooges in one photo caption, and mixed up Bud Abbott and Lou
Costello in another caption.</TE>
<TE>   The correction concluded: "We're pleased to note that we correctly
identified Laurel and Hardy."</TE>

<LD>The county Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to reject a
concrete company's plans for a huge sand and gravel mine in the Santa
Clarita area.</LD>
<LD>   The supervisors turned down Transit Mixed Concrete's appeal of a
county Regional Planning Commission decision that denied the company
a mining permit. The 460-acre Soledad Canyon project has been debated
for years and is the subject of several lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Michael Antonovich, whose district includes Santa
Clarita, led the opposition Tuesday. He said Transit Mixed Concrete
did not provide enough information about truck traffic the mine would
generate.</LD>
<TE>   Company officials said they did address the traffic concerns and
had agreed to reduce the number of truck trips during rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's vote was cheered by about 200 Santa Clarita residents,
many wearing T-shirts and buttons protesting the mine. Most of the
opponents arrived at the downtown hearing on buses chartered by the
city of Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   Transit Mixed, owned by Mexico-based mining giant Cemex, has
federal approval to extract 78 million tons of material from federal
land east of the Antelope Valley Freeway. It would be the largest
gravel mine in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the mine would damage air quality, deplete water
resources and endanger wildlife along the Santa Clara River. Transit
Mixed officials say the mine would not harm the environment, and is
needed to meet the demands of the local building industry.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the company filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court
that seeks to force the county to issue the mining permit, which the
planning commission denied in August 2000. The suit accuses the
county of deliberately delaying the project.</TE>

<DH>Politics: Election rival Sgt. John Stites tries to drive a
wedge between the sheriff and his Jewish supporters by citing his
praise for a Nation of Islam leader.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attempting to build support for his longshot challenge to Los Angeles
County Sheriff Lee Baca, a candidate in that race is accusing Baca of
tolerating "groups that threaten the safety of the Los Angeles Jewish
community," a reference to praise by Baca of a Nation of Islam
leader.</LD>
<LD>   An angry Baca retorted that his opponent, Sgt. John Stites, is
"literally a messenger of hate himself."</LD>
<LD>   The unusually sharp exchange between the sheriff and his
subordinate occurred over comments that Baca made regarding the
Nation of Islam. In a recent article in The Times, Baca was quoted as
complimenting Tony Muhammad, western regional minister of the Nation
of Islam. Baca called Muhammad a "bright, thoughtful and effective
leader."</LD>
<TE>   Stites plans to send hundreds of copies of a campaign release to
synagogues and Jewish schools throughout the county today that uses
that quote and comments on it. Nation of Islam leaders, including
Louis Farrakhan, have been accused of anti-Semitism and racism.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheriff Baca gives praise to those that hate Jews and Christians
... [and] those that are racist towards Latinos, Asians and Whites,"
Stites said in his release. "Sheriff Baca has a direct message to the
Los Angeles Jewish community--he will praise groups that threaten the
safety of the Los Angeles Jewish community for his own political
purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Baca, who prides himself on his support from a variety of
religious and ethnic groups, took sharp issue with that attack.</TE>
<TE>   "He has chosen to pander to the fears of people rather than deal
with the strengths of interfaith harmony," Baca said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's seeking to proselytize his own loathing into the hearts and
minds of the Jewish community. It will fail."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates, including Sgt. Patrick Gomez, face each other in
the election Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   They all are taking to the airwaves this week, with Baca and Gomez
paying for radio ads and Stites appearing in cable television ads on
two stations. Baca is spending about $150,000 on radio ads and
another $100,000 on slate mailers. Gomez is spending $6,000 on radio
ads and Stites is spending $20,000 to buy time on cable television.</TE>
<TE>   Political consultant Parke Skelton, who is running Baca's
reelection effort, said the sheriff is well known and highly regarded
across Los Angeles' ethnic communities.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said he is appearing on a political slate mailer with county
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who is Jewish. That mailer will target
500,000 Jewish voters.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Friedman, an attorney and president of Bais Naftoli
Synagogue in Hancock Park, said the Jewish community "could not have
a better friend than Lee Baca."</TE>
<TE>   Friedman, among others, is hosting a fund-raiser for the sheriff
this weekend in which they expect to raise $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   But Stites said Baca is a fair-weather friend. According to
Stites, Baca tells various groups he supports them, even when those
groups sometimes are at odds.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez agreed, saying, "Baca's not the best judge of character."</TE>
<TE>   But the sheriff and his campaign consultant say the attacks say
more about the challengers. "This smacks of extreme desperation,
really," Skelton said.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>With a healed wrist and a new coach, Andre Agassi held off qualifier
Cecil Mamiit, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2, Tuesday in the first round of the
Siebel Open.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing a white wristband, the second-seeded Agassi struggled
against his first-round challenger. He broke Mamiit to go up, 6-5, in
the first set, but the 25-year-old forced the tiebreaker--and then
climbed back from a 5-2 deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Agassi regained his composure, easily taking the next two sets.</LD>
<TE>   Looking on was Agassi's new coach, Darren Cahill. After eight
years, Agassi parted ways with Brad Gilbert earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi hurt his wrist in an exhibition match against Pete Sampras
just before the Australian Open earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the first round, fourth-seeded Jan-Michael Gambill had 11
aces in his 6-2, 6-3 victory over Jan Vacek.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Martin beat Christophe Rochus of Belgium, 6-3, 6-2; Brazilian
Andre Sa defeated Noam Okun of Israel, 6-4, 6-0; and Armenian Sargis
Sargsian beat Alex Kim, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7).</TE>

<HD>Washburn May Get New Deal</HD>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Angels are exploring the possibility of signing left-handed
pitcher Jarrod Washburn to a multiyear contract.</LD>
<LD>   Washburn, 27, emerged as a potential ace last season. He went
11-10, including an eight-game winning streak, and his 3.77
earned-run average led the team and ranked 13th in the American
League.</LD>
<LD>   Under General Manager Bill Stoneman, the Angels have signed third
baseman Troy Glaus and catcher Bengie Molina to long-term contracts
before each became eligible for salary arbitration.</LD>
<TE>   Washburn, who made $270,000 last year, is starting his third full
season and becomes eligible for arbitration next year. The Cleveland
Indians last weekend signed left-hander C.C. Sabathia, entering his
second full season, to a contract that guarantees him $850,000 in his
third season, $2.45 million in his fourth and $4.5 million in his
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the players' union has not responded to the owners'
no-lockout pledge with a no-strike pledge, union chief Donald Fehr
said the players have no plans to strike during the season or during
the All-Star game, scheduled for Commissioner Bud Selig's hometown of
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't even considered the issue," Fehr said after meeting
with Angel players. "You don't consider a strike except as a last
resort, when bargaining has run its course and you don't think you
have any other options that are viable.... We're a ways away from
that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have dropped out of the bidding for free-agent
infielder Rey Sanchez, Stoneman said. Sanchez is expected to sign
with the Boston Red Sox for $1.5 million and play second base. The
Angels had considered signing him to play shortstop but decided the
expense would not be worth sacrificing the offense of shortstop David
Eckstein and second baseman Adam Kennedy, one of whom would have been
benched had they added Sanchez. If the Angels decide later this
season that they need a premium defensive shortstop, they can promote
Alfredo Amezaga from triple A, at minimum wage.... Glaus, who jammed
his right ankle during a baserunning drill Monday, will not play in
today's Cactus League opener against the San Diego Padres. Matt Wise
is the scheduled starting pitcher today, with Aaron Sele and Scott
Schoeneweis scheduled to work during a seven-inning exhibition
Thursday against Cal Poly Pomona.... Tuesday was the deadline for
bids for Korean reliever Jin Pil Joong, but the Angels did not make
an offer. The Angels scouted Joong in a workout earlier this month,
but they do not believe Joong is substantially better than the
relievers they have.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. asked a New York judge overseeing its bankruptcy case for
more time to decide whether to honor its naming rights agreement with
the Houston Astros for Enron Field.</LD>
<LD>   The bankrupt former energy giant has a 30-year, $100-million
rights' agreement with the Astros.</LD>
<LD>   In a motion filed this month, the Astros said they wanted to be
let out of their 1999 agreement because the team has been materially
and adversely affected by the negative publicity surrounding the
company's bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   "The naming rights agreement does not contain any provision that
would allow [the Astros] to terminate the contract based upon the
current controversies surrounding Enron's financial affairs," Enron
said Tuesday in its objection to the Astros' motion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   B.J. Surhoff said if he's not in the Atlanta Braves' starting
lineup, he would rather play elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Surhoff, 37, was Atlanta's starting left fielder last season. He
lost that job when the Braves signed free agent third baseman Vinny
Castilla and traded for Gary Sheffield during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones is moving from third base to left field. Sheffield
takes over in right and Andruw Jones is a fixture in center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baseball owners have agreed to rehire five of the 22 umpires who
lost their jobs in a failed mass resignation three years ago and to
allow four more of the umps to retire with back pay and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement is likely to be announced today, after the baseball
official in charge of umpires meets with the five and decides they
are physically fit to resume umpiring, several baseball officials
familiar with the deal said on the condition they not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Darling, Bill Hohn, Larry Poncino, Larry Vanover and Joe West
will rejoin the major league staff. Drew Coble, Greg Kosc, Frank
Pulli and Terry Tata will retire.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Henry's ownership group could take control of the Boston Red
Sox today.... Baseball negotiations resumed with owners saying they
want to make the amateur draft international and withhold pay of
suspended players.... New York Yankee outfielder Rondell White
strained his left rib cage swinging a bat. Manager Joe Torre said
White could miss 10 days or more.... The Kansas City Royals said
outfielder Mark Quinn probably will open the season on the disabled
list because of a cracked rib that will sideline him for four to six
weeks.... Wade Miller, who had a breakout 16-8 season with the
Houston Astros last year, was picked to start the team's opener
against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 2.</TE>

<HD>Goossen Is Back With New Partner</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Promoter, formerly based in Van Nuys, joins with
Tutor to deliver Sunday night fights to Fox Sports Net.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boxing promoter Dan Goossen, formerly the head of Ten Goose Boxing of
Van Nuys, is returning to Southern California with a new partner.</LD>
<LD>   Goossen announced Tuesday that he and Ron Tutor have teamed up to
form Goossen-Tutor Promotions and signed a multiyear contract to
deliver Sunday night fights to Fox Sports Net.</LD>
<LD>   The first, on March 10, is scheduled to have Tim Witherspoon
facing Ahmad Abdim at the Green Valley Ranch resort and casino in Las
Vegas. The next, April 7, has Jhonny Gonzalez meeting Ricardo "Chapo"
Vargas in a North American Boxing Federation title fight at the
Soboba Casino in San Jacinto, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   Goossen, 52, has been in the boxing business for 20 years. He and
his brother Joe, a trainer, started out in Van Nuys with Ten Goose
Boxing, a family operation.</TE>
<TE>   Ten Goose featured Michael Nunn and the Ruelas brothers, Rafael
and Gabriel. Rafael will be involved with Goossen-Tutor on the
business side, working as an accountant and a liaison with Hispanic
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Goossen left Southern California about eight years ago and teamed
with Bob Arum and Top Rank Boxing in Las Vegas for two years. He then
was involved with America Presents, a Denver-based promotions company
that at one time handled Mike Tyson, for five years before going out
on his own six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Tutor, partner in Tutor Saliba, one of the world's largest heavy
construction companies, grew up in the same Van Nuys neighborhood as
the Goossens. He said he will not be involved in the day-to-day
operation of Goossen-Tutor Promotions.</TE>

<LD>Ben Olson, Dave Anderson, Kasey Myers and Kevin Rex first met as
sixth-graders playing for a Conejo Valley all-star basketball team.
They dreamed about winning a championship in their teenage years.</LD>
<LD>   "We used to come to high school games as little kids and think it

<TE>   Long Beach Poly 68, Capistrano Valley 44--Second-seeded Poly
(27-3) broke the Division I-AA semifinal game open in the third
quarter when Barry Barnes, who scored 11 of his 15 points in the

with three consecutive three-point baskets to push the Jackrabbits'
lead to 47-31.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Franzen had 18 points, Matt Sweany had 14 and Pete DeCasas

Occidental College.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena, which advances to a section final for the first time

missed shot was snagged by Harvard-Westlake's Evan Harris, and the
Wolverines secured the Division IV-AA semifinal game at the
free-throw line at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard-Westlake (25-5) will play El Segundo, a 78-56 winner over
Twentynine Palms, on Friday at Loyola Marymount in the title game.

<LD>New York Giant cornerback Jason Sehorn didn't impress his wife,
actress Angie Harmon, when he came home with a customized $60,000
Cadillac Escalade SUV.</LD>
<LD>   "When you put it in reverse, four spotlights shoot out of the back
bumpers, and there's a [closed-circuit TV] screen so you don't have
to turn around and look to back up," she told People magazine. "I
just want to go to the store. I don't want to dock the Star Trek
Enterprise, you know?"</LD>
<LD>   Comment from Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle: "We've
seen Sehorn get burned often enough to know why he's worried about
going in reverse."</LD>

<TE>   Mr. Nice Guy: Skip Bayless in the San Jose Mercury News, on
whether Oakland Raider owner Al Davis might go after Steve Mariucci
as a coaching replacement for Jon Gruden:</TE>
<TE>   "The Raider hierarchy views Mariucci as softer than Charmin. He's
a little too college rah-rah, too tearfully sentimental, too country
club, too corny, too melodramatic, too thin-skinned and too needy of
pats on the head to be a Raider coach."</TE>

<TE>   Shhh! Demonstrating a base-stealing lesson for reporters, new
Boston Red Sox outfielder Rickey Henderson said it's important to
take the first step toward second base with the right foot. Most

won't. No one will.</TE>
<TE>   "But it is Kobe [Bryant] who makes them a joy to watch because he

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>East Carolina didn't know how big a talent gap there would be when it
joined Conference USA this season. The Pirates are closing the gap
fast.</LD>
<LD>   The Pirates pulled off one of the biggest upsets this season,
holding No. 9 Marquette to six points in the final 12 minutes for a
51-46 victory Tuesday night at Greenville, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   "East Carolina plays as hard as anybody in this league, and that
includes us, Cincinnati, you name it," Marquette Coach Tom Crean
said. "We didn't play for 40 minutes and when you don't play for 40
minutes in this league you are not going to succeed. We need to
understand that--this time of year more than any time."</LD>
<TE>   The Pirates (12-16, 5-10) used a 2-3 zone defense that frustrated
Marquette (23-5, 12-3).</TE>
<TE>   "You can't put a price tag on what this win does for our
basketball program," said East Carolina Coach Bill Herrion, whose
club clinched a spot in the conference tournament next week at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubted whether we could compete in this league before we got
in it," Herrion added. "I told everybody we had to figure out how
wide the gap was here. Can we even get on the floor and function in
this league?"</TE>
<TE>   Travis Holcomb-Faye scored 15 points for East Carolina and Dwyane
Wade had 19 for Marquette.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Oklahoma 89, Iowa State 75--Aaron McGhee had 26 points and
the Sooners (23-4, 12-3 Big 12) capped a 16-0 home season, their
first perfect home record since 1994-95.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Florida 68, Tennessee 62--Brett Nelson made his four
three-point shots in the final 11 minutes at Gainesville, Fla., to
help the Gators (21-6, 10-5 Southeastern Conference) keep their hopes
alive for the regular-season title.</TE>
<TE>   If Alabama beats Auburn tonight, the Crimson Tide wins the
championship outright.</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Pittsburgh 73, Seton Hall 66--Brandin Knight scored 19
points and the Panthers (24-4, 12-3) scored the final 12 points in
overtime at East Rutherford, N.J., to clinch first place in the West
Division of the Big East.</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Illinois 70, No. 25 Indiana 62--Frank Williams had 24
points at Champaign, Ill., and the seventh consecutive victory for
the Illini (22-7) created a four-way tie for first place in the Big
Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State, Indiana, Wisconsin and the Illini each are 10-5 in the
conference with one game remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State 81, No. 18 Ohio State 76--Marcus Taylor scored a
career-high 32 points and the Spartans (18-10, 9-6 Big Ten) rallied
at Columbus, Ohio, for their fourth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Brown scored 24 points for the Buckeyes (19-7, 10-5).</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 Miami 81, Providence 65--Darius Rice scored 30 points for
the Hurricanes (22-6, 9-6 Big East) at Providence, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   Providence point guard John Linehan had four steals and became the
NCAA's career leader with 377, one more than Eric Murdock, who played
for the Friars from 1987-91. Providence fell to 15-14, 6-9.</TE>

<DH>Facilities: Lalas and Sampras attend groundbreaking for
Carson complex, which MLS sees as a showcase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day heavy on hyperbole, it was left to Alexi Lalas to deliver
some light relief.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't feel anything below my waist right now after that ride,"
the Galaxy defender said after he and Pete Sampras stepped down from
a bulldozer that had jostled and bumped them across a short stretch
of the campus at Cal State Dominguez Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's occasion was the groundbreaking ceremony for the
Anschutz Entertainment Group's $120-million sports complex that will
begin rising today from the dirt clods of what were once the flower
fields of Carson.</LD>
<TE>   It was a hot morning, and while Sampras sported a golf--sorry,
tennis--shirt and slacks, Lalas was uncomfortably warm in a suit.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to thank my new friend, Pete Sampras," Lalas said. "I
called him last night and said, 'Hey, is this like a really formal
gig?' He said, 'Oh, everyone's gonna be there; you've gotta wear a
suit and tie.' He's got a really good sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   While civic, university and sports leaders praised the project and
its anticipated benefits, it was Don Garber, Major League Soccer's
commissioner, who provided the only real news of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy, he said, will host the MLS championship game in 2003
and the league's All-Star game in 2004 at its new 27,000-seat
stadium, the centerpiece of the 85-acre sports complex.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium will take 15 months to complete and is scheduled to
open on June 1, 2003, according to Tim Leiweke, AEG's president.</TE>
<TE>   "The Galaxy will become much more of an international team now,"
he said. "We're going to bring in world-class teams to play against
the Galaxy and, in turn, get the Galaxy out on the road to play
against them. So the branding of the Galaxy is going to be more
international."</TE>
<TE>   Adjacent to the soccer stadium will be a 13,000-seat tennis
stadium. Scheduled to open July 1, 2003, this will be the home of the
Pete Sampras Tennis Academy and, possibly, the site of several
significant tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe one day we can get a pro tournament here," Sampras said. "I
see Bob Kramer over there [in the audience], who runs the [men's
tournament] at UCLA. Maybe one day we can get the tournament here."</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps an even bigger one.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope so," Sampras said. "The players love playing in
L.A., I can tell you that, talking to all the top players in the
world. It would be a shame not to get a big tournament here."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras said he had moved from California to Florida as a teenager
simply to find a better training facility and stronger practice
opponents. Future players won't have to do that, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When this thing gets built, people will see a see a lot of pros
they can practice against," he said. "People on the West Coast are
going to come here. Once you have the environment, we'll have a
central thing here in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward to spending a lot of time here and helping the
young guys play the sport."</TE>
<TE>   A new Olympic velodrome for cycling and a track and field facility
also will be built, but it is soccer that is the main focus of the
sports complex.</TE>
<TE>   The site will serve as the national training center for nine of
U.S. Soccer's 10 national teams, starting in August 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The defending world champion women's national team probably will
train and play games in Carson before leaving for the fourth Women's
World Cup, in China in September 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Flynn, U.S. Soccer's secretary general, said the only
exception for now will be the under-17 men's national team, which
will remain in residency camp in Bradenton, Fla., until expiration of
the USSF's current contract with that facility.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said the nation's second soccer-specific stadium, after
the one built by Lamar Hunt in Columbus, Ohio, "will put soccer in
this country on the map."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that AEG is in talks with "a few" NFL teams, including
the San Diego Chargers, interested in using the site for their summer
training camp, will not shift the focus of the complex, Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, this is about soccer," he said. "We have
never had a world-class [soccer] facility in this country and, no
offense against Columbus, but we needed to get a true European-style
stadium here where the fans can be intimately involved in the game,
with a roof to keep the noise in.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why soccer does so well [in Europe], because fans do make
a difference in this game.... We've never had that here. We're going
to have that now. Instead of playing to 80,000 empty seats, we're
going to have a packed house almost every night and it's going to be
a wonderful environment."</TE>
<TE>   Staff Writer Lisa Dillman contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>CBS Juggles Cast of 'The NFL Today'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS announced wholesale changes Tuesday to its "The NFL Today"
lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Glanville is out, Mike Ditka will have a reduced role and
Randy Cross is going back to being a game commentator.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, CBS announced that former quarterbacks Dan Marino and
Boomer Esiason will be joining the crew. Those two, plus Deion
Sanders and veteran host Jim Nantz will make up the new cast.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a guy who likes to win and I made the decision that with the
lineup of analysts that we had we weren't going to win, and I don't
just mean ratings," CBS Sports president Sean McManus said. "I mean
people watching and saying, 'The show tells us everything we need to
know.'"</TE>
<TE>   The program's ratings were up 8% last season, but it still trailed
Fox's pregame show by 58%, 4.1 to 2.6.</TE>
<TE>   McManus said he went to Leslie Moonves, the head of the CBS
network, and said he was having a tough time deciding between Marino
and Esiason.</TE>
<TE>   He said Moonves told him, "Let's play to win. Get them both."</TE>
<TE>   "The toughest thing is to find a cast that has all the chemistry
you need and the fans like," McManus said. "At the beginning of 'The
NFL Today,' we probably made a few choices that we shouldn't have
made. There were people who I thought were going to be well-received
who weren't.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I think we finally have the right mix."</TE>
<TE>   Marino said he hopes to continue with HBO's "Inside the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Esiason is leaving Fox Sports Net's "NFL This Morning" but said he
will continue as a commentator for the Westwood One/CBS Radio
broadcasts of "Monday Night Football."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Hurting, Winning</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Olowokandi joins sidelined players, but
Brand and late 11-0 run trigger a 94-84 victory over Rockets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Five minutes remaining, the game very much in doubt, two of their
starters unable to play because of injuries, their most versatile
player back in L.A. rehabilitating injuries, and the Clippers still
looked poised and polished.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers had every reason to fail, but refused to play the
victim down the stretch. They grew stronger with each passing minute
in the fourth quarter, taking a 94-84 victory Tuesday from the
Houston Rockets before an uninterested crowd of 10,293 at Compaq
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Down by one point, the Clippers seized control swiftly and
certainly late in the game. Darius Miles made two free throws with
5:22 left. Jeff McInnis sank a jump shot, then another. Elton Brand
stepped into the path of Houston guard Steve Francis, taking a charge
and fouling out Francis with 3:21 to play.</LD>
<TE>   Next, Brand made a layup and a free throw after he was fouled,
then followed with a dunk moments later for a 92-82 lead, capping an
11-0 run that propelled the Clippers to their third victory on this
five-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   "We are playing with a lot of key guys out, but we are stepping up
as a team," McInnis said after the Clippers' first winning trip of
the season. "We just have to keep playing and, hopefully, good things
will happen for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have latched onto a "No Excuses" mantra. So what if
center Michael Olowokandi was out because of a sprained left knee.
Big deal if small forwards Corey Maggette (hand and concussion) and
Lamar Odom (wrist and ankle) could not play.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were determined Tuesday, drawing within one game of
the .500 mark at 29-30. What's more, they improved to 14-16 during a
stretch in which they played 21 of 30 games away from Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Significant contributions came from everywhere, including center
Obinna Ekezie, who started in place of Olowokandi and scored 11
points in 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But, wait, there was more. Rookie Tremaine Fowlkes started at
small forward and scored eight points in 20 minutes. Reserve center
Sean Rooks had eight points and seven rebounds and backup point guard
Earl Boykins added six points.</TE>
<TE>   Those four players combined to make 15 of 21 shots (71.4%).</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, and Brand had 26 points and 15 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   In his last four games on the trip, Brand averaged 23.8 points and
18.5 rebounds. And to think, he has been playing with a stretched
tendon in his right ring finger, which hampers his ballhandling.</TE>
<TE>   "Elton is playing as well as anybody in the league right now,"
Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "But, I'm telling you, it's a good
team win for us. We're plugging guys into the starting lineup that
most people have never heard of."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the Clippers were not facing the future NBA champions
in the Rockets, who were without four key players. What's more, the
Clippers pretty much owned the paint, outrebounding the Rockets,
41-29. They also had 22 second-chance points to only eight for
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   But the Clippers' most impressive accomplishment was shutting down
Francis, fouling him out and muzzling the other Rockets down the
stretch. First and foremost, the Clippers extended their defense,
refusing to allow Francis and fellow guard Cuttino Mobley a running
start toward the basket.</TE>
<TE>   When Francis picked up his fifth foul, the Clippers funneled him
toward the basket and Brand stepped into his path. Without Francis,
who fouled out with 25 points, the Rockets faltered. The Clippers
outscored the Rockets, 15-4, in the final 6:04.</TE>
<TE>   "The Clippers are really getting their chemistry together, and
Elton Brand shows why he is an All-Star," Houston Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. "They're not buying into that negativity that used
to surround the Clippers. They're going to change. They are a good
team."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as the Clippers showed in Monday's victory over the
Memphis Grizzlies and Tuesday against the Rockets, they have come to
rely more on substance over style. They made the simple plays,
forgoing the flashy ones.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to build on these last two games and try to get a win
Saturday," McInnis said, referring to playing against the Golden
State Warriors at Staples Center. "We've got to get to .500 again and
get off this roller coaster we've been on."</TE>

<LD>Clipper center Michael Olowokandi did not play Tuesday against the
Houston Rockets because of a slight sprain of the posterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee. He is scheduled to undergo an MRI exam
today, when the team returns home.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi was injured during the Clippers' victory Monday against
the Memphis Grizzlies. He joined small forward Corey Maggette, who
has dislocated fourth and fifth metacarpals on his right hand, on the
bench Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers also were without Lamar Odom, who skipped the trip to
rehabilitate his sprained right wrist and ankle.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry gave rookie Tremaine Fowlkes his second
consecutive start at small forward and played Obinna Ekezie at
center.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where we are," Gentry said of having to start Ekezie.
"We've just got to keep battling. The injury thing has happened at
the most inopportune time, but it's happened."</TE>
<TE>   Guard Keyon Dooling did not play Monday against the Grizzlies or
Tuesday against the Rockets and Gentry said he would undergo an MRI
exam on his left ankle later this week. Dooling sat out 43 games
because of a sprain.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to be a little more patient with himself," Gentry said.
"When you're an explosive basketball player like he is, you feel like
you've lost something. He hasn't really lost it. It's just going to
take some time to get back to where he was."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Francis, the Rockets' leading scorer with an average of 21.8
points, started Tuesday against the Clippers. Francis canceled an
appointment Monday at the Mayo Clinic, where he hoped to learn more
about the migraine headaches he has suffered..</TE>

<HD>LEVELING THE FIELD</HD>
<DH>Flatter Marathon Course Should Produce Faster Times</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Organizers of the Los Angeles Marathon hope to pull a fast one on the
23,000 runners expected to participate in Sunday's 17th annual race.
After surveying 30,000 past L.A. Marathon participants who
overwhelmingly endorsed the idea of a flatter, faster course, the
layout for this year's 26.2-mile race has been significantly changed
for only the third time in the event's history.</LD>
<LD>   "When 90% of your customers say they want a course change, you
listen," said Bill Burke, president of the Los Angeles Marathon.</LD>
<LD>   Through the years, Burke has exhibited an unquenchable need for
speed, envisioning a race that would produce fast times and draw the
world's best marathoners and recreational runners alike.</LD>
<TE>   Kenyan Simon Bor established an L.A. Marathon record when he won
in 2 hours 9 minutes 25 seconds in 1999, but Burke, who co-founded
the event after the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, has long pined for
a sub-2:09 time on the course.</TE>
<TE>   Benson Mbithi of Kenya won in 2000 in 2:11:55 and Kenyan Stephen
Ndungu won last year in 2:13:13.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, however, might finally see his goal fulfilled thanks to a
course that no longer features as many big hills and has expanded
into previously uncharted territory on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   "It always depends on the weather," Burke said. "If the course is
right and the weather is right we could have a sub 2:07. I'm kind of
hoping we don't because I'll probably have a seizure from being so
happy."</TE>
<TE>   The first 10 L.A. Marathons began and ended at or near the
Coliseum. But in 1996, the course was changed in part because some
top runners asked marathon officials to make the route faster.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to give the downtown area a shot in the arm, the 1996 race
began at 8th and Figueroa Streets and finished at the Central Library
at 5th and Flower. Not everyone was thrilled with a course that was
basically the original layout in reverse.</TE>
<TE>   "It has the hills in the wrong place," Belgium's Eddy Hellebuyck
said after he dropped out of the 1996 race after 16 miles. "At about
the time you get tired, 22 or 23 miles, there are the hills. You need
more downhill to the finish line than that."</TE>
<TE>   This year's race will be substantially downhill from the start.</TE>
<TE>   The race begins at Grand Avenue and 2nd Street at the top of
Bunker Hill, elevation 405 feet, and gradually descends to 112 feet
at mile 9. The most challenging incline comes at mile 17 when runners
will climb from 115 feet to 200 feet over a three-mile stretch. On
the previous course, runners had to negotiate a 300-foot climb over
14 miles. Exposition Park, the Crenshaw District, Cheviot Hills and
Koreatown remain part of a course that will take runners past City
Hall for the first time since 1995 and through the 2nd Street tunnel
for the first time. Also for the first time, the course extends west
past Fairfax Boulevard to Robertson Boulevard. The race ends downtown
on Hope Street between Olympic Boulevard and 9th Street.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, areas that have seen the marathon come and go
include Olvera Street, Silver Lake and Chinatown. The biggest
casualty of this year's course change is the area with the steepest
elevation gain--Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Burke called the decision to eliminate the
traditional Hollywood portion, "gut-wrenching."</TE>
<TE>   Leron Gubler, president and chief executive officer of the
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said the race would lose some of the
cache it enjoyed by excluding the Hollywood landmarks that made it an
attractive site for runners and viewers alike.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand why it's been taken away--it is uphill from
downtown or the Coliseum to Hollywood ... but there is a little bit
of sadness in losing it because Hollywood has always been a player in
the marathon," Gubler said.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Curl, vice-president of the marathon, said this year's course
was selected from among last year's course and three alternative
layouts posted on the L.A. Marathon's website. Marathon officials
sent out 30,000 e-mails asking for feedback.</TE>
<TE>   Curl said the challenge was to design a faster, flatter course
that started and ended in the downtown area, as opposed to a
point-to-point layout like those used in Boston and New York. A
computer and topographical software program was instrumental in
helping Curl cut one of the hilliest major-city marathon courses down
to size.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just say, 'This looks better. This looks faster,'" Curl
said. "Every single step of the way has to be charted.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days, when you designed a marathon, you got out the
[U.S. Geological Survey] topo maps and a magnifying glass and went to
work. Five or six years ago, we tried using [Global Positioning
System] but that wasn't the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, you get a topographical program, you take the cursor
and move it along the course route and it will tell you the
elevations."</TE>
<TE>   Curl is confident the course will have appeal for runners of all
ability levels.</TE>
<TE>   "We love the elite athletes, we want them to break records, but
this is for the average Jane or Joe who runs the L.A. Marathon," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Connelly, who heads the L.A. Roadrunners marathon training
program, said he has taken nearly 2,000 runners on bus tours of the
new course and the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive.</TE>
<TE>   "The old course had what I call the Red Zone, the most difficult
part came during those last eight miles," Connelly said. "The new
course still has some light rolling hills at 221/2 and 23 miles, but
for the first 13, you can fly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm warning people not to get lulled into a false sense of
security. They'll still have 13 miles to go."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers are confident that many of those who go the distance
will be rewarded for their effort with personal-best marks. Curl
expects just as much feedback in the days after the race as he
received before it.</TE>
<TE>   "The report cards come out March 3," Curl said. "I will be either
universally loved or loathed."</TE>

<HD>Pressler Promotes Uhlich to Vice President Post for Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Uhlich, a longtime Angel executive whose career with the team
started as a batboy in 1976, was promoted Tuesday to vice president
of business administration for the club.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Pressler, the executive who oversees Disney's professional
sports teams, said he would create a similar position for the Mighty
Ducks and make an external hire to fill it. Uhlich is 44.</LD>
<LD>   Pressler said he has decided to separate most business operations
of the teams but hire one president to replace Tony Tavares, who
resigned Jan. 4. Pressler said he has not yet interviewed potential
replacements and would not do so until he completes his review of the
operations of both teams.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, Pressler said general managers Bill Stoneman of
the Angels and Pierre Gauthier of the Ducks would continue to report
directly to him. Pressler said he envisioned the search for a new
president lasting from one to four months, perhaps with the
assistance of an executive search firm, and said he did not believe
his extended stewardship of the teams would hamper them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like you're trying to fill a GM position," he said.
"That you would really have to fill immediately, and it's not
something I'd be capable of doing."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, chairman of Disney's parks and resorts division, had
considered not replacing Tavares but decided otherwise after
examining the operations of other corporate owners of multiple pro
teams. Pressler also said the Angels and Ducks will have their own
marketing, promotions and publicity departments.</TE>
<TE>   The model borrows from AOL Time Warner. Stan Kasten is president
of the Atlanta Braves, Hawks and Thrashers.</TE>

<HD>Lo Duca Looks to Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Catcher Paul Lo Duca, who was so distressed about being sent to the
minor leagues two years ago that he nearly quit baseball, signed a
three-year, $7.25-million contract Tuesday, cementing his immediate
future with the Dodgers and burying a sometimes-painful past.</LD>
<LD>   "There were a couple of times I thought I would shut it down and
go home," said Lo Duca, who was demoted to triple-A Albuquerque to
back up catcher Angel Pena to start the 2000 season. "My dad asked me
if I wanted to go home and wash dishes [at his Phoenix restaurant].
To be honest with you, I didn't want to be here at one time. Now, I
want to be here forever."</LD>
<LD>   Last season changed everything. Lo Duca, who spent seven seasons
in the minor leagues, won a starting job in spring training and had a
breakthrough season, batting a team-high .320 with 25 home runs, 28
doubles and 90 runs batted in despite missing 37 games.</LD>
<TE>   He hit .379 with runners in scoring position and he was the
third-hardest batter to fan in the NL with 30 strikeouts in 460
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Though he hit .300 or better in five of his first six professional
seasons, Lo Duca's career seemed stalled at triple A in 2000. He even
asked to be traded that year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really hard to fathom right now, considering where I was
at a few years ago," Lo Duca, 29, said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, the million-dollar question is, can I do it again this
year?"</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca will be guaranteed $380,000 this season, $2.5 million in
2003 and $4 million in 2004, and his contract eliminates two of his
three arbitration years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii will not pitch in a Grapefruit League
game until the second week of March because the Dodgers want to do
everything they can to simulate Ishii's spring-training experience in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese teams train for two months, but they have only 20
exhibition games before starting the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Major league teams train for six weeks but play about 30
exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Jim Colborn, who spent four years as a coach for
the Orix Blue Wave in Japan, said Ishii will throw batting practice
or a simulated game around March 6-8 and then make five exhibition
starts before the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Dodger team physician Dr. Frank Jobe underwent coronary
artery bypass graft surgery Tuesday at Centinela Hospital Medical
Center in Inglewood. He is scheduled to remain in the hospital for
several days.... Right-hander Andy Ashby, who is recovering from
elbow surgery, threw 60 pitches during a bullpen workout Tuesday,
mixing in split-fingered fastballs for the first time this spring.
Though he experienced a little shoulder tightness, which he said is
normal, and had trouble finding a consistent rhythm, Ashby was
pleased with his progress.... Texas running back Cedric Benson, the
Big 12 Conference offensive freshman of the year last season and a
12th-round pick of the Dodgers last June, will play about 21/2 months
for a Dodger minor league team this summer before returning to
college for football practice.</TE>

<LD>Mighty Duck defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky brought a bronze medal home
from the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Teammate Ruslan Salei brought home a cold--and good memories.</LD>
<LD>   Tverdovsky helped Russia to a third-place finish, but Salei helped
make Belarus a country of hockey fanatics after the Belarussians
upset Sweden and reached the semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   "They are going to name streets after us," Salei joked Tuesday.
"That's the new rumor. Then they will probably print us on money. I
don't know which one would be the bigger thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The team arrived yesterday and, talking to my family, there was a
huge crowd at the airport. There was a huge concert for the team, a
huge celebration. It was like when [the Czech Republic] won the gold
medal [in 1998]. The reaction in Belarus was amazing. People were
walking the streets, screaming 'Belarus.' We made people pay
attention to hockey in Belarus."</TE>
<TE>   People in Russia are certainly aware of hockey, which is why
winning the bronze was nice, but losing to the United States in the
semifinals didn't take the team to the heights of the old days, when
the Soviet Union dominated the sport in international play. Still,
there was some of that old-time feeling for the players.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hockey we were raised with," Tverdovsky said. "That is how
they taught us in Russia. A lot of skating and a lot of passing. It
was a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tverdovsky said that the controversy surrounding the officiating
and the threats by Russian officials to pull out of the Games had no
effect on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no talking among coaches or players, we didn't think
about it," Tverdovsky said. "We thought about going and playing the
game. It was a big game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was little bit surprised [that they used NHL officials]. I
think it should have been a European ref. But I think he did a pretty
good job. I can't say he was doing something bad to us. There were a
few questionable calls, but that's everywhere. It's like that in NHL
sometimes too."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL officials were as familiar with Russia's players as they
were with the United States' players, since almost all played in the
NHL. But the Olympics are different, Tverdovsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the back of their minds we're Russians and they're North
Americans," he said. "But I thought they did a fair job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will hold a ceremony before tonight's game to honor
their three Olympians, including Paul Kariya, who helped Canada to
its first gold medal in 50 years. Kariya will rejoin the Ducks today.</TE>
<TE>   The medals won by Kariya and Tverdovsky will be on display in the
arena, as will jerseys worn by Tverdovsky and Salei during the Games.</TE>

<LD>The road to perfection is paved with good luck, and unbeaten Long
Beach Poly traversed that road Tuesday in its victory over Chino
Hills Ayala.</LD>
<LD>   Two marquee players for Ayala fouled out, and two players who had
done nothing offensively turned into heroes in the final minutes of
the second-seeded Jackrabbits' 42-40 Southern Section Division I-AA
semifinal victory at Long Beach City College.</LD>
<LD>   Natasha Gray made her first point of the night on a free throw
with 2 minutes 39 seconds remaining to give Poly the last of 12 lead
changes, 39-38, and Cynthia Buggs made her only shot with 1:11 to
play for what turned out to be an insurmountable 41-38 lead.</LD>
<TE>   "I was feeling a lot of pressure," said Gray. "I'm one of the
worst free-throw shooters on the team."</TE>
<TE>   Kameca Simmons scored 15 points for Poly, which made only 14 of 28
free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala's Kia Riley, with 16 points and 11 rebounds, fouled out with
2:39 to go and point guard Jacqulyn Karp fouled out with 19.6 seconds
left. That left Ayala's offense in dire straits.</TE>
<TE>   With fouls to give, Poly let the clock tick down to 13 seconds
before fouling again, forcing Ayala to inbound the ball. Unable to
get the ball to Brittany Sieger, who had 10 points, reserve Ashley
Sumida, who had just entered the game, had her three-point shot
blocked by Judith Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't get the ball to [Sieger]," Ayala Coach Mel Sims said.
"They were nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Poly (32-0) will play in its first title game since winning in
1995. Ayala finished 26-5.</TE>

<TE>   Lynwood 80, Long Beach Wilson 76--The top-seeded Knights took the
lead for good on Janice Bright's running bank shot with 1:08
remaining in the Division I-AA semifinal game at Long Beach Millikan.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights (28-0) trailed by as many as eight points in the
second half before closing the third quarter on a 13-0 run to take a
56-51 lead. Wilson battled back to take a 63-61 lead on two free
throws by Neka Mixon with 4:08 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   After LaJoyce King's free throw gave Lynwood a 66-65 lead with
2:57 remaining, the lead changed hands six times over the next 1:49
before Bright's go-ahead bank shot gave the Knights a 75-73 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Sade Wiley-Gatewood scored 30 points to lead Lynwood. Sheila Ho
Ching scored 24 points for Long Beach Wilson (26-6).</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Hart 63, Westminster 49--Hart trailed, 40-36, late in the
third quarter before closing with a 27-9 run to win a Division I-A
semifinal at Huntington Beach Ocean View High.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Ashlee Trebilcock and sophomore Brandi Kimble each had 19
points for the third-seeded Indians (26-4), who advance to their
first final since winning consecutive titles in 1989 and '90.</TE>
<TE>   April Robles scored 16 for second-seeded Westminster (24-5), which
was making its first appearance in the semifinals.</TE>

<TE>   San Clemente 52, Huntington Beach Edison 39--With the victory at
Capistrano Valley, the defending Division I-A champion Tritons (26-3)
returned to the finals for the fourth time in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore center Lindsey Pluimer had 26 points, including 12 in
the fourth quarter, and grabbed 13 rebounds for top-seeded San
Clemente, which staved off an aggressive Edison team.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Brown scored 13 and Bianca Ziemann had 11 for the Chargers
(20-9).</TE>

<LD>Freshman McCall Zerboni scored in the second half of overtime to give
No. 2-seeded San Clemente a 1-0 victory Tuesday over third-seeded
Anaheim Esperanza in a girls' Division I semifinal match at
Esperanza.</LD>
<LD>   Zerboni converted her team-leading 13th goal from 13 yards in the
92nd minute of play after taking a pass from senior midfielder
Kristen Moore in a crowd on the right side, just inside the penalty
box.</LD>
<LD>   Zerboni's goal sends the Tritons (20-3-3) into a division final
for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   "Knowing McCall, I knew she'd probably be there," said Moore, who
has had two goals and an assist in the Tritons' last three games.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente will face South Coast League rival Capistrano Valley,

<HD>New Golf Tour in Works</HD>
<DH>Majors: Proposed circuit would be for former winners, 37-55
years old, who are rarely in the hunt on the regular tour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do such golf stars as Fred Couples, Nick Price, Paul Azinger,
Curtis Strange and Steve Elkington have in common? They have all won
major championships and now they are part of an elite group
considering withdrawing from the PGA Tour to join another tour
featuring only major winners.</LD>
<LD>   The Major Champions Tour, which would be open to major winners
between 37 and 55 and played on such storied courses as Winged Foot,
Merion and Baltusrol, would begin play in 2003. It remains deep in
the planning stages, hinging almost entirely on a television deal,
although player interest seems to be running high.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's a very interesting idea," said Peter Malik of IMG,
who represents Mark O'Meara and Strange. "I think guys will take a
serious look at it, that's for sure. Mark's seen it. He's looked into
it. Even though there are a lot of issues on the table, you would be
silly not to."</LD>
<TE>   The concept of such a tour would be to fill in a competitive gap
between great players of their era who are not always in the hunt on
Sundays on the PGA Tour and a growing sense that the Senior PGA Tour
is not something they would wish to play when they reach 50.</TE>
<TE>   "The [PGA] Tour is for guys who hit it a country mile," said the
agent for one player with several major titles but who did not want
to be identified. "This era we're talking about just doesn't have
that anymore. The [PGA] Tour is being set up for guys who are
younger, stronger, longer, faster, which is the way it should be.</TE>
<TE>   "But what's being talked about here is a platform for those guys
to compete and get re-energized. That's what they're looking for,
besides the money."</TE>
<TE>   The depth of the quality of players eligible for the new tour is
impressive. Greg Norman and Nick Faldo gave up their PGA Tour
memberships this year. Among the others who would be eligible to play
include Mark Calcavecchia, John Daly, Lee Janzen, Bernhard Langer,
Tom Lehman, Jose Maria Olazabal, Corey Pavin, Jeff Sluman, Craig
Stadler, Hal Sutton, Lanny Wadkins, Tom Watson and Ian Woosnam.</TE>
<TE>   There are 35 players who will be between 37 and 55 in 2003 and
have won major championships.</TE>
<TE>   The first-year plan calls for as many as six or eight events on
the Major Champions Tour, each with a minimum purse of $2 million.
Each tournament would be a 72-hole stroke-play event with a cut to
the low 20 and ties. Prize money would range from $500,000 to the
winner, $200,000 to the runner-up and $50,000 for 20th place.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Roach, who is Couples' agent, said his client brought him the
idea at the PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club in August.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been very open about it and excited about the chance to play
with legends like Greg Norman and Nick Price and Nick Faldo, and then
to play on great courses, you can see how inviting it is," Roach
said. "It takes stars we've known for the last 15 or 20 years and
showcases them, which doesn't really happen right now on the PGA
Tour. All we're saying is 'Here's an idea. Does it make sense to the
group?' I think most people like the idea. Will it work out? I guess
time will tell."</TE>
<TE>   Couples asked independent television producer Terry Jastrow to
draft the details of the proposal and more important, to try to land
the Major Champions Tour on television. Unless there is a TV deal, as
well as a corporate sponsor, there is no tour.</TE>
<TE>   Jastrow is an expert in televised golf events and was senior
producer of golf at ABC for 20 years, where he oversaw 68 majors. He
also was partner with Jack Nicklaus in a television production
company.</TE>
<TE>   "All I've done is to explore the feasibility of such a tour and to
try to determine the level of player commitment," Jastrow said. "I
find the concept so intriguing, I'm happy to do it."</TE>
<TE>   A new, four-year PGA Tour television package begins in 2003 and
tournaments are parceled out to CBS, ABC, NBC, USA, ESPN and the Golf
Channel. Fox is not part of the deal, so it would be the only major
network buyer of the Major Champions Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports chairman David Hill said he and Fox Sports President Ed
Goren met with Jastrow on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Terry is a delightful person and a very dear friend," Hill said.
"And he has an interesting proposal. But then we get a lot of
interesting proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "We listened to this one and we'll consider it."</TE>
<TE>   As for how important it is that Fox have golf, Hill said, "I
really can't say, although I'd say it is not as important as the NFL,
baseball or NASCAR."</TE>
<TE>   Golf does stack up pretty well against other sports. Through 13
regular-season telecasts on NBC to date, the average Nielsen rating
is a 2.9 with a 7 share. Through CBS' first four golf tournaments,
the four that make up the West Coast swing of the PGA Tour, the
average is a 2.8 with a 6 share.</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour's television contract represented a 25% increase in
rights fees to $850 million, based on generally increased ratings
numbers, a circumstance that is usually credited to the emergence of
Tiger Woods as the preeminent player in the world. For instance, the
fourth round of the Masters, where Woods won for the second time,
drew a hefty 13.3 rating.</TE>
<TE>   The last time someone floated an idea for a new tour, it quickly
sunk. In 1994, the so-called World Tour, a partnership between Norman
and Fox, never got off the ground. At that time, PGA Tour
Commissioner Tim Finchem lobbied behind the scenes to scuttle the
fledgling tour, using the threat of holding back player releases to
prevent them from jumping ship.</TE>
<TE>   That would not be a consideration for the Major Champions Tour,
because none of the players would be members of the PGA Tour. So far,
the PGA Tour has done nothing to shoot down the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're aware of the general concept, but we lack substantial
detail on the proposal and some of the specifics and how it would be
implemented," said Bob Combs, senior vice president of public
relations and communications. "In view of that, we have no specific
comment."</TE>
<TE>   The new tour would be played during the normal golf season,
beginning in March, with tournaments scheduled so they would not
conflict with majors or popular PGA Tour events.</TE>
<TE>   The impact the new tour would have on the Senior PGA Tour can only
be imagined. The Senior Tour, which has been around since 1980, has
enjoyed a comfortable niche as the only playing arena available for
players when they reach 50. That could change now.</TE>
<TE>   However, there is no guarantee that players such as Couples, Price
and Norman would play the senior tour anyway. This is the first
generation of players who are so financially independent that they do
not need the senior tour. But they do have a need for quality
competition, Roach said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fred didn't sign up for the senior tour when he signed up for the
PGA Tour," he said. "And if he left the PGA Tour, would he rather
play with guys like Faldo, Norman and Olazabal? Why wouldn't he? He'd
get more out of that."</TE>
<TE>   What ramifications there may be for players who leave the PGA Tour
is not known, although there is certainly nothing in the scenario
that would affect the players' pension plans because the players
already are vested.</TE>
<TE>   IMG's Malik says not enough is known about how resigning from the
PGA Tour would affect a player's insurance plan, or endorsement
income that stipulates a player must play in PGA Tour events. There
also is the issue of the PGA Tour owning the rights to a player's
image and likeness.</TE>
<TE>   However, even without a PGA Tour card, a player in the top 50 on
the career money list, which many of the players on the proposed tour
would be, can still play in as many as 10 selected PGA Tour
events--drawn from the four majors, the three World Golf Championship
events and seven sponsors' exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, it's too early to say there's a new game in town,
but like those who have studied the idea of a Major Champions Tour,
Malik is intrigued enough to follow the events closely.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, there are a lot of things that need to get fleshed out
before they get even one player who will sign on the dotted line," he
said. "But there's no denying this. It's certainly a viable option to
look at."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Larry Stewart contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Even though the king of Santa Anita's hillside turf course won't be
participating, the $75,000 Reb's Policy Handicap will still be a very
interesting race.</LD>
<LD>   El Cielo, who has won 10 of 14 races on the grass in Arcadia, was
scratched Tuesday morning--along with Spinelessjellyfish and
I'madrifter--leaving a field of nine to go about 61/2 furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   Of those remaining, only three have victories on the unique
layout--Macward, 3-1 morning-line favorite Lake William and Lookn
East.</LD>
<TE>   Macward, a 6-year-old gelding co-owned and bred by Marvin Malmuth
and trained by Ian Jory, has four wins on the local course, including
a mild 9-2 upset over Echo Eddie and five others in last month's
Sensational Star Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Lake William, trained by Richard Mandella and owned by Mr. and
Mrs. Jerry Moss, has only one win on the hill, but it did come in a
stakes. Last April 16, on the final day of the winter-spring meet, he
won the San Simeon Handicap, beating among others, Macward and Touch
Of The Blues, who will also be running this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Lookn East is perfect on the course. He is two for two, having
rallied from off the pace to win at nearly 19-1 last fall during the
Oak Tree meet, then going wire-to-wire to win at 19-10 last month.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The only other turf race on the card at Santa
Anita is the fourth, a wide-open miler that was left with a field of
10 after two scratches. The 7-2 choice on Jeff Tufts' morning line is
Mon Ange, who is dropping out of graded company to make her first
start on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bob Baffert. After a slow start, he has moved into his
usual position atop the Santa Anita trainer standings. He begins the
week with 20 victories, three more than Bill Spawr.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's 10th at Gulfstream Park. The eight
maidens are a combined 0 for 75 and have managed only 14 on-the-board
finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three singling Pleasantly Perfect in
the third; using Dynamous, Glorious Linda and Angel Gift in the
fourth; and Count Your Cards, Dream Counter and Prized Friend in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/129. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $0/$772.80. Total money bet: $770.</TE>

<HD>Knee Surgery to Leave Jordan's Status in Air</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Realizing the worst fears of admirers like his former coach, Phil
Jackson, and his current coach, Doug Collins, Michael Jordan will
undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, which, the Washington
Wizards acknowledge, could end his comeback season.</LD>
<LD>   The surgery is scheduled to be performed today or Thursday by
Wizard team physician Stephen Haas.</LD>
<LD>   "[Haas] has got to go in there and just find out what's causing
the irritation and why his knee is continuing to swell," Collins said
at Tuesday's practice. "And depending on how much work he has to do,
that will be the deciding factor in how long Michael will be out."</LD>
<TE>   The Wizards, who have gone into a protective shell around Jordan
this season, provided few other details.</TE>
<TE>   The story that Jordan would have surgery broke not from Washington
but Chicago, where the Sun-Times' Lacy J. Banks quoted a source,
described as close to Jordan as saying:</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with surgery is that his team is on the playoff
bubble so the timing couldn't be worse. There are just 27 games left
in the season. If he has to sit out five or more games, that could
cost them their chance of making the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, 39 and coming off a three-season retirement, has had
problems with the knee since training camp.</TE>
<TE>   In early December, he flew back to Chicago for a second opinion
and sat out a game at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   However, he returned and led the Wizards on a 24-12 run that took
them as high as No. 4 in the Eastern Conference, soaring into the
All-Star break on the heels of a 108-101 victory over the Sacramento
Kings, owners of the NBA's best record.</TE>
<TE>   He is averaging 24.3 points, six rebounds, 5.4 assists and 36.7
minutes, and is shooting 42%.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, as swept up as anyone else, forgot his plan to limit his
minutes, averaging 40 in the last 10 games before the break, and
announced he'll probably return next season.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the Wizards, who'd gone 19-63 last season, were on
a 45-win pace, which would have been one of the biggest improvements
in NBA history. Jordan was an MVP candidate and the All-Star weekend
a star turn for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sure he was going to average 20-plus," said New Jersey
Coach Byron Scott before the game in Philadelphia. "I didn't think he
would do this well and have his team playing as well as they've been
playing.</TE>
<TE>   "One man can change the total attitude, the total makeup of a
team, and he's done that."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's hard when the man is 39.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan began struggling in the first game after the break, making
eight of 20 shots and scoring 22 points in a loss to the Lakers at
Staples Center, ballyhooed as a showdown between Jordan and Kobe
Bryant. They didn't guard each other and Bryant scored 23 (with 15
assists and 11 rebounds.)</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards headed down with Jordan, losing seven of eight. Their
only win was 97-96 at Phoenix, when he made a last-second 17-foot
jumper.</TE>
<TE>   Last week he scratched himself for the second time this season for
a game at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   This time, taking one game off didn't do it. He came back with 17
points in a home loss to the New Jersey Nets and scored 37 in another
home loss to the Heat. The next night at Miami, trying to go
back-to-back, he shot four for 13, scored nine points and sat out the
last 6:27.</TE>
<TE>   After that, seeming to feel all his years, he said flatly, "I'm
old," and talked about going on the injured list--for the second time
in his career and the first since 1985--to rest.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe this is the time we really see what we have with our young
players," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   He also seemed to be re-thinking next season.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some things that I've been talking with some of the
doctors in terms of what I may need to be doing in the off-season,"
Jordan said. " ... I'm more or less focusing on the moment. When the
season ends, that's when I'll think about next season."</TE>

<HD>Kings Get Back in Their Groove</HD>
<DH>Hockey: L.A. overcomes first-period rust to beat Columbus,
5-1, for 20th win in 31 games. Tippett wins first game as coach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>King interim Coach Dave Tippett walked outside the Kings' dressing
room following a 5-1 victory over Columbus on Tuesday night, looking
like a coach who didn't have a worry in the world.</LD>
<LD>   After watching Adam Deadmarsh, Ziggy Palffy and Jason Allison
combine for four goals and 10 points, Tippett--who's filling in for
ailing Coach Andy Murray--seemed to take his first NHL win in stride.</LD>
<LD>   "Both teams were a little rusty in the first period, but as the
game went on, I thought our guys did a great job of picking up the
tempo," Tippett said. The Kings improved to 20-6-4-1 over their last
31 games with the win in front of a sellout crowd of 18,136 at
Nationwide Arena.</LD>
<TE>   With Murray recovering from post-concussion syndrome in Minnesota
after his Feb. 15 single-vehicle accident, the Kings didn't get off
to the fast start they hoped for against Columbus, the worst team in
the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets jumped on top on a goal handed to them by the
Kings. With fewer than five minutes remaining in the opening period,
defensemen Aaron Miller and Mathieu Schneider, along with goaltender
Felix Potvin, misplayed a soft pass deep into the Kings' zone and
Columbus forward Robert Kron made them pay with a goal at 15:15.</TE>
<TE>   So in their first game after the Olympic break, the Kings found
themselves down a goal after one period. But that did not faze
Tippett.</TE>
<TE>   "We just talked about how we got the first period out of the way
after the break," Tippett said. "We felt confident that if we played
the way we could, we'd be fine because we have some guys who can
score some goals for us."</TE>
<TE>   A major understatement to say the least. The Kings scored goals
over the final two periods as if they were in a layup line.</TE>
<TE>   They ripped through the Blue Jackets over the final 40 minutes,
outshooting them, 29-16, during the span.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't doing too much offensively in the first period, but we
began to click after that," Allison said. "Once we got going, it
really came easy for us."</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh scored his 19th and 20th goals in the second period,
sandwiched around Brad Chartrand's fifth of the season. In the third
period, Palffy scored his 21st and Allison picked up his 14th to
complete the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "Tip has been around for a while and he knows the game too,"
Potvin said. "But as far as how we play on the ice, we're not
changing anything. So all we have to do is keep playing the way that
we've been playing."</TE>
<TE>   A key for the Kings' surge after the first period was the play of
Ian Laperriere, Mikko Eloranta and Chartrand.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a great spark out of Chartrand's line," Tippett said.</TE>
<TE>   Chartrand's goal came after his line kept the puck in the Blue
Jackets' zone for what seemed like five minutes. Laperriere set up
the score with a nifty fake on Columbus goaltender Marc Denis, who
finished with 29 saves, and defenseman Jamie Heward, before passing
to a wide-open Chartrand.</TE>
<TE>   "After the first period we said that we needed some energy,"
Chartrand said about his goal that gave the Kings a 2-1 lead 6:36
into the period. "We got that one shift under our belt early in the
second and we took off from there.... It was basically work ethic
that got us going."</TE>
<TE>   The special teams of the Kings, who had the second-best power play
and penalty killing units in the league before Tuesday's game, also
had a big night. Columbus did not score in three man-advantage
situations, while the Kings' power play was two for four.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, who finished with 20 saves for the Kings, was solid after
a shaky start.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a couple of times that maybe our communication wasn't
the best between our defensemen and him," Tippett said.</TE>
<TE>   For Tippett, it was bittersweet to gain his first NHL victory over
Columbus Coach Dave King, who coached him on two Canadian Olympic
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Dave and I are very good friends and it was an honor to be
coaching against him," Tippett said. "I know that I certainly
wouldn't be where I am without his input."</TE>

<HD>Walker Will Give Injured Elbow a Little More Rest</HD>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Forward Samaki Walker, eligible to come off the injured list for
tonight's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, is far from ready.
He still has swelling in the joint of his right elbow, which he
hyperextended playing against the Portland Trail Blazers on Feb. 17.</LD>
<LD>   Walker also has a bone bruise in that area.</LD>
<LD>   "I am not going to worry about one game against Minnesota," Walker
said. "I am better off letting it heal. I don't want to damage it any
more. If this was the playoffs, it would be different."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard to tell from the way he played Tuesday night
against the Milwaukee Bucks, but Kobe Bryant has a contusion on one
knee, the result of banging that knee in Sunday's game against the
New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant shrugged off that injury, which caused him to sit out
Tuesday morning's shoot-around, as he did with the sprained left
thumb he also suffered in the New York game.</TE>
<TE>   "I played when I could not even breathe," Bryant said, referring
to a rib injury he suffered in the postseason last year. "This is
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like every other coach in the league, Milwaukee's George Karl
doesn't know how to play Shaquille O'Neal and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a quandary," he said before Tuesday's game. "Do you let them
get 20 apiece? Do you let them get 30 apiece? Nobody will argue that
they are two of the top five players in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "All you can do is hope that their role players don't hurt you.
All you can hope is that you get lucky that way."</TE>
<TE>   Karl didn't get lucky Tuesday night. O'Neal and Bryant combined
for 55 points and Laker role players filled in the gaps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night's victory gives the Lakers a league-best 20-9 road
record. They are also 7-1 against the Central Division.... Glenn
Robinson moved into third place on the Bucks' all-time scoring list
with 11,487 points, passing Bob Dandridge. Milwaukee's all-time
leader is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, followed by Sidney Moncrief.</TE>

after surgery last Thursday for a fractured left leg. The Lakers are

<HD>Lakers Are Up to a Challenge</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Bucks make a late run, but L.A. improves to
4-0 on trip with 99-89 win behind O'Neal and Bryant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>This was supposed to be a true test for the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   These weren't the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are going nowhere, or
the Charlotte Hornets, who are trying to go to New Orleans, or the
New York Knicks, who are going to be scattered to the far corners of
the NBA at season's end if management has its way.</LD>
<LD>   These were the Milwaukee Bucks, leaders of the Central Division, a
team that came within one game of the NBA Finals last season, a team
that has realistic hopes of getting there this season.</LD>
<TE>   So while the Lakers had already beaten the Cavaliers, Hornets and
Knicks on this trip and had begun to show the rhythm and cohesiveness
they know they will need in the postseason, Tuesday night's visit to
the Bradley Center was expected to provide a better measuring stick
of how far they have come.</TE>
<TE>   The result?</TE>
<TE>   In the words of playground players everywhere: Next.</TE>
<TE>   With all cylinders operating smoothly and efficiently, the Laker
juggernaut rolled on, much to the dismay of a crowd of 18,717,
beating the Bucks convincingly, 99-89.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's in first place?" Shaquille O'Neal said afterward when he
was asked about beating a division leader. "Oh, the Bucks are in
first place?"</TE>
<TE>   He said it with a smile and a wink.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Coach George Karl has been known to bait opposing
players. He has done his share of trash talking with O'Neal in the
past. But Karl played it straight Tuesday night, not even trying to
deny the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a very good basketball team," Karl said. "I think
everyone can see."</TE>
<TE>   Colorful? No. Honest? Quite.</TE>
<TE>   What was so overwhelming was the total effort. O'Neal was O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant was Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had game-high totals in points (28 on nine of 18 from the
floor and 10 of 17 from the free-throw line) and rebounds (13).
Bryant was right behind him in points with 27.</TE>
<TE>   As do most teams, the Bucks came at the 7-foot-1, 330-pound O'Neal
in waves. Starting center Joel Przybilla racked up four fouls, and
Ervin Johnson had five fouls in 15 minutes. But with O'Neal
connecting on 59% of his free throws, that strategy was foiled.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, O'Neal became incensed when asked about the 7-1,
255-pound Przybilla.</TE>
<TE>   "Przybilla is a hack," O'Neal said. "He has no chance of success.
He is not strong enough. He has no chance of stopping me as long as
he plays this game."</TE>
<TE>   That sounds like bulletin-board material, but in this case, it
would probably shatter whatever little shreds of confidence Przybilla
still has.</TE>
<TE>   For all that O'Neal and Bryant provide, however, the Lakers know
they can't win as a two-man team. They need role players to play key
roles and they got that Tuesday night from Derek Fisher and Devean
George, who both came off the bench to make big shots.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher scored 15 points, including three of five from three-point
range. George, known more for his defense, had 10 points, including
three of three from beyond the arc.</TE>
<TE>   With all that, the Lakers found themselves in a game with just
over eight minutes to play. Down, 76-68, the Bucks put together a 9-0
run culminating in a three-point basket by Sam Cassell that moved
Milwaukee into a one-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to get our feet back on the ground," Laker Coach Phil
Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   And sure enough, it turned out to be the last time Milwaukee would
be heard from.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers immediately put together an 8-0 run of their own that
extended to 13-2 and, just like that, they were back to a 10-point
lead.</TE>
<TE>   As impressive as the Lakers were on offense, they were equally so
on defense, especially in the fourth quarter after Milwaukee had made
its last-ditch run.</TE>
<TE>   "We took every individual out of their sweet spot," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell was Milwaukee's leading scorer with 21 points, but he made
only eight of 18 from the floor. Glenn Robinson had 19 points, but he
was only five of 12. Ray Allen, who was matched against Bryant, had
only 15 points, taking nine shots. He had only two points in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We can beat a lot of teams in this league when we are not playing
our best basketball," Allen said, "but when you play a team of this
caliber, it won't cut it."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jayson Williams is out for now as an NBA analyst for NBC Sports.</LD>
<LD>   The former NBA All-Star has been charged with second-degree
manslaughter in the shooting death of a limousine driver. Williams
surrendered to authorities Monday and is free on $250,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   "NBC Sports and Jayson Williams have reached mutual agreement that
it's best for Jayson to focus on his personal issues and to not be on
the air until those issues are resolved," the network said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The case against Williams probably will not be resolved quickly. A
prosecutor said he does not expect to present the case to a Hunterdon
County grand jury for several months.</TE>
<TE>   In his first season with NBC, Williams is known for his humorous
style. He had been scheduled to appear on the network Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Marv Albert, NBC's lead NBA play-by-play announcer, was fired by
the network within hours of pleading guilty to assault and battery in
September 1997. He had continued to work for NBC after being indicted
that May. Albert returned to NBC in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Acting county prosecutor Steven C. Lember planned to argue that
Williams recklessly handled the shotgun that killed Costas Christofi,
55, of Washington Borough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Menk Bateer, most valuable player of the Chinese Basketball
Association All-Star game, has rejoined the Denver Nuggets. Bateer,
26, was with Denver in training camp. The 6-foot-11 forward-center
becomes the NBA's second Chinese player, joining Wang Zhizhi of the
Dallas Mavericks.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Baltimore Ravens said Tuesday they will cut eight key players,
including tight end Shannon Sharpe, free safety Rod Woodson and
receiver Qadry Ismail.</LD>
<LD>   Ozzie Newsome, the team's personnel director, said Elvis Grbac
won't be the team's quarterback unless Grbac restructures the
$30-million, five-year contract he signed last year.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts are expected Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew that we would be facing some serious cap issues in 2002,
but the opportunity to win two Super Bowls in a row was overwhelming
to us," Newsome said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two sources told the Associated Press that Danny Wuerffel will be
traded by the expansion Houston Texans to Washington, rejoining Coach
Steve Spurrier, under whose guidance he won the 1996 Heisman Trophy
at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver extended the contract of Rod Smith, who led the league with
113 receptions last season. The deal, worked to give the Broncos more
cap room, is worth $40 million over seven years, including an
$11-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bronco linebacker Bill Romanowski, who earned two Super Bowl rings
with Denver, is headed to Oakland to play for the Raiders, two
television stations reported.... Linebacker Marvin Jones, whose
$6-million contract would have counted against the salary cap, was
released by the New York Jets.... Detroit announced that Herman
Moore, their leading career receiver, agreed to renegotiate his
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings argued in court that a lawsuit over lineman
Korey Stringer's death should be heard in Blue Earth County because
that's where he died of heatstroke Aug. 1 after collapsing in
training camp at Mankato, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   His widow, Kelci Stringer, and family are suing the Vikings in
Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis, where they want the
case heard.</TE>
<TE>   Giuseppe Colucci, a 21-year-old soccer player with Italy's Serie A
Verona, won't have to perform military service after a court in Lazio
ruled he can benefit from a 1997 law allowing draft exemptions for
those with "artistic" talents.</TE>
<TE>   Olympics</TE>
<TE>   Spain's Johann Muehlegg, the German-born cross-country skier
stripped of his 50K gold medal for doping, learned that the "B"
sample of his urine test also had proved positive.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a serious shortage of accommodations for the 2004 Summer
Olympics, the Greek government said that no new hotels will be built.
About 90% of Athens' 21,000 hotel rooms will be reserved for IOC
officials and guests.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>

<TE>   NASCAR fined Robbie Reiser, Matt Kenseth's crew chief, $30,000

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 12-day Olympic break made Scott Gomez's goal-scoring drought seem
even longer.</LD>
<LD>   Gomez scored twice, Canada's gold medal-winning goalie Martin
Brodeur made 21 saves and the New Jersey Devils beat the New York
Rangers, 4-3, Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   Gomez scored the game-winner at 10:36 of the third period when he
sliced across the crease and tapped in a pass from Bobby Holik. It
was his first goal since Jan. 10.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be a 50-goal scorer, but I can put the puck on
net," Gomez said. "It was a huge win and it was good to score,
because it's been a long time between goals."</TE>
<TE>   Brodeur felt well enough to play, but his U.S. Olympic
counterpart, Mike Richter, sat out for the Rangers. Daniel Blackburn
made 23 saves for New York.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Lindros and Theo Fleury, who also played for Canada, scored
for the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury, who has 181 penalty minutes, received a tripping penalty
and a 10-minute misconduct late in the third period, irking Coach Ron
Low.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't keep doing this," Low said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury later threatened to retire if he doesn't get the respect he
feels he deserves from NHL officials, who he said have a "personal"
bias against him.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Tampa Bay 3--Brendan Shanahan, playing with a broken
thumb, scored two goals, including the game-winner 2:55 into overtime
at Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Lightning forward Dave Andreychuk scored his 241st career
power-play goal, putting him eight behind Phil Esposito's NHL record.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit got the equalizer with 8:25 left in regulation when Luc
Robitaille scored his 24th goal this season and 614th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, New York Islanders 3--Michael Peca's second goal of the
game--a short-handed tally off a rebound with 1.4 seconds left in
regulation--helped the Islanders to a tie at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 4, Florida 3--Ken Klee's goal midway through the third
period proved the winner at Washington and extended the Capitals'
unbeaten streak to a season-high five games.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, Chicago 4--Olympians Jeremy Roenick and Simon
Gagne each had a goal and an assist, leading the Flyers at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, Buffalo 1--Rookie Ilya Kovalchuk scored with 3:06 left
to lift the Thrashers at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 5, Montreal 2--Daniel Alfredsson scored his 29th goal for
Ottawa on a power play midway through the third period at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, Carolina 1--Curtis Joseph made 27 saves for the Maple
Leafs before breaking his left hand at Toronto. Joseph, who left with
8:22 remaining, is expected to be sidelined six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 5, Nashville 1--Teemu Selanne scored two goals in the
first period at Nashville and the Sharks won their sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 5, Dallas 1--Daymond Langkow had two goals and two assists
at Phoenix, and the Coyotes gave Coach Bob Francis his 100th victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Belfour lasted two periods, giving up four goals on 17 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 2, Colorado 2--Joe Sakic had a goal and an assist to give
the Avalanche a tie at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Roy stopped 30 shots for Colorado. Roman Turek had 27
saves.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Vancouver 4--Bryan Helmer scored a power-play goal
with 1:29 left in regulation and the Canucks rallied for a tie at
Vancouver, Canada.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Edmonton Oiler goalie Tommy Salo's family has been harassed since he
gave up the winning goal in Sweden's stunning Olympic hockey loss to
Belarus, according to Pittsburgh goalie Johan Hedberg.</LD>
<LD>   Sweden's fans took the loss hard, with newspapers ridiculing the
players, particularly Salo. One newspaper published the players'
pictures and NHL salaries and called them guilty of betraying their
country. Another paper called it "a day of shame."</LD>
<LD>   "It's been tough for him," said Hedberg, who is Salo's friend and
was his backup in the Olympics. "People back home [have been
complaining] to his parents, have been mean to them. Even his
sister's kids in school, the other kids have been mean to them.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Salo, the star of Sweden's gold-medal winning team in 1994,
allowed the winning goal to bounce in off the side of his head in
Belarus' 4-3 quarterfinal victory Wednesday, one of the biggest
Olympic hockey upsets ever.</TE>

<HD>Sampras Changes Coach Again</HD>
<DH>Tennis: After a short 'trial period' with Gullikson,
Higueras is next in line.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The coaching alliance between Pete Sampras and Tom Gullikson lasted
less than four months, two tournaments, one trip to Australia and did
not survive the outdoor hard-court season.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras, who hired Gullikson to take Paul Annacone's spot in
December, has made yet another move, an intriguing one, by replacing
Gullikson with Jose Higueras. The arrangement with Gullikson was only
supposed to be a test run, until the Miami tournament in late March,
Sampras said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The trial period is over and we still remain very close friends,"
Sampras told The Times. "Also, I will be working with Jose Higueras
and he will still be working with Paul [Annacone] and the USTA."</LD>
<TE>   Higueras, who twice reached the French Open semifinals in the
early '80s, is the kind of coach players speak about in reverential
tones. Under his guidance, Michael Chang won the French Open in 1989,
the first American male to win in Paris since 1955 and, at times, has
worked with Todd Martin and Jim Courier.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, Higueras has been the men's coach for the USTA's touring
pro program. He will still retain that job--which is being redefined
by his boss, who happens to be Annacone.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a terrific coach, great person, honest, works hard," said
Annacone, the managing director of USA Tennis High Performance.
"There's no smoke and mirrors, what you see is what you get. It's a
great opportunity for Pete and the USTA. It's going be mutually
beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   "Coaching is personal preference. He's at the stage where he needs
something different than me and, I guess, than Gully, and I think
Jose can bring that to the table for him."</TE>
<TE>   Gullikson was with Sampras at the Australian Open, where Sampras
lost to Marat Safin in the fourth round. Speculation is Gullikson
could end up coaching a female player, possibly Jennifer Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   Higueras, who is based at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage, will
also have his duties expanded to work with female players in the
USTA's program. He won't necessarily be with Sampras at every
tournament, Annacone said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sampras] has been able to come to terms with a different
schedule, so he can get the benefit of using [Higueras'] skills
without having to take him away from the focus with us, so everyone
will be happy.</TE>
<TE>   "Pete gets our kids aware of what it is like to be a champion,"
Annacone said. "Ideally, I've got to look out for the program.
Whenever I can get an elite champion, whether it's Pete, Andre
[Agassi] or Lindsay [Davenport], I'll try to do that to make that
reality."</TE>

<HD>The L.A. Chargers? Only if We Have Write Stuff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So it appears the Chargers will be conducting training camp at Cal
State Dominguez Hills in July 2003 in a brand-new facility, and then
after stumbling on the field again in San Diego, I predict they will
try to move to Los Angeles on a permanent basis to begin the 2004
season.</LD>
<LD>   This presents a dilemma: They will try--but should we help?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   WHEN THE NFL awarded Houston an expansion franchise because it met
the NFL's extortion demand of $700 million and public money for a
stadium, league leaders blamed The Times for hurting L.A.'s effort to
get a team, while congratulating the cheerleaders at the Houston
Chronicle for championing their city's cause.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Browne, right-hand man to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, not
only blamed The Times for not doing its job in rallying the taxpayers
of L.A. to fight harder in providing a new playpen for an expansion
team, but said The Times was also responsible for paving the way for
the Rams' departure--failing to lead the public-money charge to keep
the team here.</TE>
<TE>   When Seattle Seahawk owner Ken Behring tried to move his team to
Anaheim, he expressed great dismay when the L.A. media failed to
greet him with puff pieces.</TE>
<TE>   When Arizona Cardinal owner Bill Bidwill looked toward L.A., The
Times reported that if Bidwill's team won every game it played for
the next 19 years the franchise under his leadership would still not
have a .500 record.</TE>
<TE>   Some people considered this negative reporting; I considered them
roadblocks designed to keep losers out of town. I got here after
Donald Sterling had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   When Raider owner Al Davis lost his court case in L.A., which
would have led to the team's return, he said The Times changed
reporters in the middle of the trial--taking away someone considered
Raider-friendly, and replacing him with someone familiar with the
Raiders' shady way of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   Now we have Charger owner Alex Spanos knocking at the door, which
makes me long for those Russian Sputnik days when we had underground
bunkers to hide in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WONDER now, however, if we shouldn't take our lead from St.
Louis, which embraced Georgia Frontiere--knowing full well it didn't
go well for the last seven husbands who did that--and now has the
most exciting team in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   There's even a newspaper precedent here for making this happen.
The Chargers left L.A. in 1961 because Jack Murphy, sports editor and
columnist for the San Diego Union, convinced team owner Baron Hilton
that San Diego was ready for football, and then Murphy urged city
politicians to build a stadium, which later was named after him. I
have to admit I like the ring of Simers Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   To do something like that here would mean replacing Dwyre as
sports editor of The Times, and making me both sports editor and
columnist. Frankly, I don't see that as a big problem.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked Jerry Magee, the first reporter for the San Diego
Union to cover the Chargers in 1961 and now the best NFL writer in
the country, if a sports editor and columnist for The Times could
swing the same deal with the Chargers today and woo them back to
L.A., he said, "First thing you have to do is get a dog.</TE>
<TE>   "Murphy frequently wrote about 'Abe of Spoon River,'" Magee said,
"and his columns about the dog were well read by the women of the
region, which was one of his strongest assets in influencing the
public."</TE>
<TE>   I asked if I could lovingly substitute my wife for the dog, and
Magee said, "She ought to kick your butt," and I had to remind myself
that Magee doesn't want the Chargers to leave, so he was going to say
some things to unsettle me.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I could write some positive things about the Chargers to get
people excited in L.A. and help swing a deal for a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "But Jack was a very talented writer," Magee said, "and Jack was
widely read," and I had to remind myself Magee doesn't want the
Chargers to leave, so he was going to say some things to unsettle me.</TE>
<TE>   "And Jack had a very literary style," Magee said, and I said, "OK,
we'll get a ghostwriter for the Page Two column."</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest," Magee said, (and who wants Magee to be honest?) "I
think the Chargers will move. The city of San Diego is not going to
build them another stadium. When Spanos came here he had no
particular feeling for San Diego. It was just a way into the NFL.
[Alex and son Dean] now think the bottom line is their God. So if
someone builds them a stadium, they'll go."</TE>
<TE>   The fact the Anschutz empire is about to strike a deal to bring
the Chargers to L.A. to use the training camp facility it's building
for an NFL team is a pretty good tip-off about who might build the
Chargers a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Chargers do leave, I think it will be a mistake," Magee
said, "because L.A. is the worst NFL town in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Those are stirring words, of course, and I'm not sure I've ever
felt prouder, which is going to make it very difficult to say
anything that makes it easier for the NFL to come back and rip us
off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Mr. Anonymous:</TE>
<TE>   "Your Olympic column was laugh-out-loud-funny and I am sharing it
with my three sons, who always felt it was my fault [they weren't
better athletes]. I can't share it with my wife, however, since she
bears a striking resemblance to Max Patkin."</TE>
<TE>   Larry, I kept your name out as you asked. By the way, I had a
friend in school with the last name of "Rossi" too; could he be a
relative?</TE>

<HD>Young, Crispin Work Toward Bigger Roles</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>They both shoot hundreds of jump shots a day at Pauley Pavilion while
their teammates are watching film or dressing. They are part of the
team, yet separate.</LD>
<LD>   Until next season, anyway. Veteran guards Ray Young and Jon
Crispin keep reminding themselves that their time will come.</LD>
<LD>   Young is redshirting after having played three seasons at UCLA and
will be a senior next season. Crispin, who transferred from Penn
State, is sitting out according to NCAA rules and will be a junior
next season.</LD>
<TE>   "Redshirting has been harder than I thought it would be," Young
said. "I know I'm doing the best thing for me and the program, but
during games, especially, it's very hard to sit and observe."</TE>
<TE>   Young travels with the team, rooming with Matt Barnes on the road.
He played in 94 games the last three seasons, starting 22 and
averaging 6.0 points. Although a gifted offensive player, his
shooting percentage overall and from three-point range dropped each
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm spending the year going back to basics, focusing on my
fundamentals and getting my stroke back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Crispin also is a shooter, averaging 8.2 points and making 36.8%
of his three-point attempts in two years for Penn State. He scored 26
points in an upset over Kentucky last season and helped the Nittany
Lions advance to the round of 16 in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't travel with UCLA, but works hard every day in practice,
anticipating a significant role next season.</TE>
<TE>   There should be ample playing time for both players next season.
Leading scorer Jason Kapono, a junior, is expected to jump to the NBA
and the next three leading scorers--Billy Knight, Matt Barnes and Dan
Gadzuric--are seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Young and Crispin are expected to share shooting guard duties,
playing opposite point guard Cedric Bozeman, and could be on the
floor together in some alignments.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With two regular-season games remaining, No. 19 USC is in a three-way
tie for second place in the Pacific 10 Conference and in prime
position to win a share of its first league title since 1985, when
the Trojans shared the crown with Washington.</LD>
<LD>   All the Trojans (19-7, 11-5 in Pac-10) have to do is sweep
first-place Oregon (20-7, 12-4) and eighth-place Oregon State (12-15,
4-12) Thursday and Saturday at the Sports Arena and USC is assured of
at least splitting the regular-season championship.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had a great year and we've played good basketball," Coach
Henry Bibby said. "We've had probably three to four games where we
didn't come to play all year and that's pretty good. We've done
probably as much as I thought we would do coming into the season.</LD>
<TE>   "In my mind, we've surpassed a lot of what I expected and, like
I've said all along, I'm greedy. I want to get it all. We're this
close and I think we have a chance to get it all."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserves Gennaro Busterna and Jerry Dupree, who were kicked out of
practice Monday for poor work ethic, were allowed to practice Tuesday
and will suit up for the Oregon game, Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A proposed game next season between USC and Duke at Madison Square
Garden in New York has fallen through after the Blue Devils declined
to take part.</TE>
<TE>   According to USC officials, the game would have been part of a
doubleheader, similar to the one the Trojans played this year against
Pepperdine after Gonzaga beat Fresno State in the Fab 4 at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   USC's schedule is tentative, but the Trojans' marquee
nonconference game is against Missouri in the Wooden Classic at the
Arrowhead Pond on Dec. 7.</TE>

<LD>The Kings' original plan after Coach Andy Murray's single-vehicle
accident on Feb. 15 was to have assistants Dave Tippett, Mark Hardy
and Ray Bennett share coaching duties in his absence.</LD>
<LD>   But once the Kings learned Murray would be out indefinitely with
post-concussion syndrome, General Manager Dave Taylor decided that
three interim co-head coaches were two too many.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt it was important to have one coach with the final say, so
on an interim basis, until Andy gets back, I felt it was better to
have Dave [Tippett] handle those duties," Taylor said before the
Kings' 5-1 victory over Columbus on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   For now, the Kings will continue to go with three coaches but if
Murray's recovery lingers, Taylor said the team might add another
assistant. One possibility is to promote goaltending consultant Andy
Nowicki, who has worked with Felix Potvin and Jamie Storr throughout
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not sure what the time frame will be with Andy, we just
want him to focus on getting better," Taylor said. "We're going to
move forward in this fashion but we can bring [Nowicki] in if we felt
that it was important. But the coaches are comfortable with the
number of guys we have, so that's the way we're going to proceed
right now."</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to name a downtown
intersection "Joel Wachs Square" to honor the 30-year veteran of the
council who resigned in October to become head of a New York arts
foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Although Wachs lived in Studio City and represented the San
Fernando Valley, the council sought to recognize his involvement in
promoting the arts by choosing the intersection of Grand Avenue and
2nd Street, which is between the Museum of Contemporary Art and
Disney Concert Hall.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very honored and very grateful," Wachs said.</LD>

<LD>With assurances from Los Angeles officials that the city will comply

board voted Tuesday to support Proposition Q, a $600-million bond
measure for police and fire facilities on next Tuesday's ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Some VICA members had believed the bond measure failed to comply
with state law because it did not list on the ballot the specific
projects that would be funded.</LD>
<LD>   But the city attorney's office has since concluded that the
measure complies with state law.</LD>

<LD>A federal judge sentenced a Woodland Hills man to 2 1/2 years in
prison and ordered him to pay a $30,000 fine for evading taxes on
more than $1 million he obtained through car insurance fraud,
authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Joshua Shideh, 36, pleaded guilty in October to evading an
estimated $429,000 in taxes on $1.15 million he earned in 1995 and

<LD>   Shideh referred car wreck victims to attorneys in a small ring
that made false insurance claims, said a spokesman for the U.S.

<HD>City Posts Reward in Vandalism of Valley School</HD>
<DH>Crime: The council offers $5,000 in the arson that
destroyed two classrooms and calls for a review of district police
force cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alarmed by a rash of vandalism at Los Angeles schools, the City
Council offered a $5,000 reward Tuesday for information on the
torching of two classrooms in North Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Arson caused $50,000 in damage Sunday to Coldwater Canyon
Elementary School.</LD>
<LD>   "The classrooms were completely destroyed," Assistant Vice
Principal Burt Govenar said. "We are pretty much in disarray because
of that."</LD>
<TE>   Vandals also sprayed fire extinguishers and wrote gang graffiti on
the walls of the cafeteria and an office, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The North Hollywood campus was vandalized twice before in recent
months, Govenar said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, City Council members voted for a similar $5,000 reward
after vandals broke into Erwin Street Elementary School in Van Nuys
and spray-painted swastikas and the words "white power" on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Govenar said he is concerned that too few school police officers
patrol on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Before and after school and on weekends, only five or six patrol
cars, with two officers in each, are available to cover the
district's 900 campuses. On weekends, only one or two cars patrol the
Valley's 230 schools.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from driving through campuses, the cars patrol problematic
areas or respond to calls, said Gwenn Perez, chief of the Los Angeles
Unified School District police force.</TE>
<TE>   The 288-member force has not grown in size despite the addition of
90,000 students over the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Officers lost through attrition are not being replaced because of
a hiring freeze, and a retirement package being offered is expected
to reduce the force by another 10, Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's not the time for the district to be adding officers,"
she said. "But [students] can't learn if [they] don't have an
environment that is safe. It's devastating to come back and see your
school destroyed or damaged."</TE>
<TE>   Although figures are still being tallied, incidents of vandalism
are expected to be higher than last year, said Cira Zamora, a school
district data analyst. In the 2000-01 school year, there were 1,779
reports of vandalism, down from 1,898 the previous year, school
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Zamora said vandalism has cost the district about $14 million the
last three years.</TE>
<TE>   With so few officers, Perez said, the only option is to rely more
on schools to close gates, lock windows and doors and make equipment
more recognizable as district property if it is stolen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very upsetting pattern," Councilman Jack Weiss said.
"These are serious acts of vandalism that strike fear into the hearts
of the community, which wonders whether it is safe to send their
little kids to these schools."</TE>
<TE>   Before the vote, Councilmen Dennis Zine and Alex Padilla called
for a review by the council's Public Safety Committee of cutbacks in
the school police force.</TE>
<TE>   "As I understand it, their deployment on weekends has been
drastically reduced or eliminated in many parts of Los Angeles," said
Zine, a former police sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD already is taxed to the limit handling calls away from
schools, Zine said, so the school district should reexamine its own
budget cuts in campus patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "It creates this climate where [vandals] can get away with this,"
Zine said. "The cost to refurbish that school is going to be
tremendous in lieu of the cost of deploying police officers to patrol
those campuses, especially on the weekends."</TE>

<HD>School Board Considers Two Bids for Belmont</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two competing bidders pitched ideas to complete the Belmont Learning
Complex to the Los Angeles school board Tuesday, in hopes of winning
a multimillion-dollar contract with the district.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. Roy Romer has recommended that the board support the
Alliance for a Better Community, a Latino educational advocacy group,
as the development team with the best plan to finish the high school
and solve environmental problems at the 35-acre site.</LD>
<LD>   But board members are still weighing their options. Next month,
the board will decide whether it will support one of the two bidders,
the alliance group or Komex H20. If the board decides against
completing the school, the district may opt to sell the site.</LD>
<TE>   Board member Julie Korenstein worried about how safe it is to
continue building the campus, which sits on an old oil field. Member
David Tokofsky questioned the bidders' different approaches to
building tarp-like membranes to block pollution. Member Marlene
Canter wondered how likely it is that a membrane would become
damaged. Others questioned plans to monitor the site for
environmental problems.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky said picking a group to contract with to build on the
site is easy. His main concern is "the same thing that got us into
trouble last time": Who will negotiate price, timeline and other
issues once the developer is chosen?</TE>
<TE>   But Romer said the school can be built safely under the alliance
group's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It is cost-effective," he said. "We really need it. We have such
a struggle in this district to find adequate space."</TE>
<TE>   The alliance group's proposal offers a lower fee structure than
Komex H20, a more focused approach to environmental concerns and a
schedule that would complete the school sooner, according to Romer.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the campus was halted in 1999 after methane gas
and gasoline byproducts were discovered underneath the site.</TE>
<TE>   The completion job is expected to last about three years and cost
$67 million to $87 million. The project has already cost $154
million.</TE>
<TE>   The school, which is more than 60% complete, would accommodate
about 4,600 students.</TE>

<HD>Lack of Police Recruits May Cost L.A. Millions in Federal
Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles could lose millions of dollars in federal aid if the
Police Department doesn't dramatically step up the pace of officer
recruitment, Mayor James K. Hahn warned Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   As part of President Clinton's initiative to put 100,000 more
police officers on the streets, the city received $133 million to
help with recruitment. But the LAPD, struggling to fill its ranks,
has been able to use only about $4 million of the grant so far.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles has one year left to spend the remaining money, which
could be used to pay 90% of the salaries of 500 police officers for
three years.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn, who has been at odds with Police Chief Bernard C. Parks over
Parks' attempt at a second term, said he is frustrated that more was
not done to recruit officers and take advantage of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We really are behind the eight ball here because of the lack of
attention paid to this issue during the last years," he said. "If we
are unable to access these funds, these funds will go somewhere
else."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan said the department has been working hard
to bring new officers onto the force, adding that officials hope to
hire 300 by June.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that we haven't met our hiring goals does not suggest we
have not worked hard at it," said Brennan, noting that recruitment
has been down in police departments across the country. "It suggests
there are lot of other factors at play."</TE>
<TE>   Brennan said Clinton's initiative caused many cities to speed up
their police hiring in recent years, making new recruits even more
sought after. In recent months, the department has seen a surge in
applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Former City Councilman Mike Feuer said city officials have been
worried for the last few years that the federal money could be at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be such a shame that at [a] time of rising crime" the
city had to return federal money, Feuer said. "If there was ever an
important moment when federal dollars were significant in Los
Angeles, that moment is now."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and other city officials said they hope a recently
streamlined recruitment process will help bring in more officers this
year. The wait to get hired by the LAPD has been whittled from nine
months to about 150 days, the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   If the city fails to take advantage of the grant money, it risks
more than just federal support, said City Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski, chairwoman of the Public Safety Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good money we wouldn't be able to use; but more than that,
it would mean we had failed in getting the number of officers in the
system that we need," Miscikowski said.</TE>
<TE>   When then-Vice President Al Gore came to the city in September
1998 and announced that Los Angeles was getting $133 million to hire
officers--its largest federal policing grant--local officials were
jubilant.</TE>
<TE>   "The message to criminals is clear," then-Mayor Richard Riordan
said. "It's your turn to be afraid."</TE>
<TE>   But before the city had a chance to use the money, the number of
applicants to the Police Department began dropping.</TE>
<TE>   By June 2000, the department had lost 200 more officers to
attrition than expected and hired only half of the 800 recruits it
had planned on for that fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   During the next year, almost half of the Police Academy training
classes had to be canceled because of a lack of recruits.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department has been struggling to keep its numbers up
for several years, hampered by a complicated and long application
process and competition from smaller departments. Recently, an
additional requirement that potential officers take a polygraph exam
created a huge backlog.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, the department's ranks fell to 9,140--17
officers below the baseline set by the federal government, making the
grant money off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, Riordan's office sought and received a waiver from
the U.S. Department of Justice that lowered the baseline to 8,126
officers. The city used the grant money for the first time that
spring, hiring 79 officers.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn called it embarrassing that officials had to ask the federal
government for lenience. The mayor said he hopes the faster
application process and a new, flexible work schedule will attract
more people and allow the city to use the funds.</TE>
<TE>   If Los Angeles can't spend this money, Hahn added, "you run the
risk of not being on the list the next year."</TE>

<LD>It was a beautiful day, Monday was, but that's not news.</LD>
<LD>   It was a busy day, too, and that is news. Twice that day,
everybody got hustled out of Terminal 2 at LAX for non-bombs. (One
was a tin of cookies.) Teachers at three Valley elementary schools
showed up for work to find their classrooms trashed and torched. A
pair of Orange County men went to court for supposedly pocketing 26
million bucks they raised in the name of veterans, firemen and AIDS
patients.</LD>
<LD>   And on its way to the front page of this newspaper was a headline
about life after 9/11: "Many search for meaning and reinforce ties to
loved ones. But will it last?"</LD>
<TE>   I got your answer right here.</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence? How about a block of TV news vans, parked grill to
taillight outside the criminal courts building in downtown Los
Angeles, all lined up for the manslaughter/murder trial of the San
Francisco couple who adopted some Aryan Brotherhood con and whose big
dogs killed a small woman in the hallway of their apartment building.
You probably know the trial as the "dog/sex/mauling death case."</TE>
<TE>   Is it big news? For San Francisco, yes indeed, which is why L.A.
is hosting the trial: saturation coverage by the Bay. But is it big
news for the rest of California? The country? Not in my notebook.</TE>
<TE>   You want some real news? California has an election in six days,
for governor, insurance commissioner, secretary of state, members of
Congress, and a park bond measure. Orange County votes on that El
Toro airport thing, again. Gary Condit gives it a try, again.</TE>
<TE>   You want shocking stories about dogs and humans?</TE>
<TE>   A couple of miles from the courthouse is a city animal shelter,
where another week of killing is underway. L.A., just the city, kills
a thousand--a thousand--dogs and cats a week because humans trashed
them: didn't feed them, vaccinate them, keep them from breeding more
throwaway creatures. There's horror for you.</TE>
<TE>   Headlines have already been made here in Division 53. In the
1970s, two Native American activists were sent to trial in the murder
of a cabbie. Emily Harris, first runner-up in the Miss SLA contest,
sat at the defendant's table. Those trials had news heft, some
political content, however overheated.</TE>
<TE>   This is a family tragedy being milled into kibble and circuses.</TE>
<TE>   So now we have Camp Canine. It isn't Camp O.J., that caravansary
of satellite trucks and computer cables and coffee cups, but neither
is this the O.J. Simpson case.</TE>
<TE>   We the Media--me included--expended wall-to-wall hours of air time
and hectares of newsprint on O.J., and we sussed out some Redeeming
Social Value to justify it: the potency of celebrity, the perfidy of
the LAPD and, if there happened to be a frisson here and there of sex
and silicone, it was sanitized through the dignity of the Superior
Courts of California.</TE>
<TE>   What is the probing societal issue here? That prison gangs are
dangerous? No kidding. That unneutered dogs are more aggressive?
Knock me over with a Milk-Bone.</TE>
<TE>   Even old courthouse hands have been surprised by the reporter
stampede. The first "overflow" listening room since the O.J. case,
five floors above Division 53, has been opened for reporters who
can't get seats in court. (No TV permitted except for opening
statements, closing arguments and the verdict.)</TE>
<TE>   In the courtroom, 27 news outfits have reserved seats. On that
list are People, the Washington Post, CNN, the New York Post, local
TV stations and newspapers, Rolling Stone, and a gay magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The crime reporter from Dog Fancy magazine has not yet surfaced,
but Glamour magazine ("for young women interested in fashion, beauty
and a contemporary lifestyle") wrote about this case at length last
summer ("Could it happen to you?")</TE>
<TE>   For a newspaper, this can be a small story in a big section. But
those rare and precious minutes of TV news air time are the most
valuable virtual real estate in LA. And today is the last day of
sweeps month. I don't need to draw you a picture, do I? And even
though the judge has excluded any testimony about bestiality, there's
always the titillating line, "The judge has excluded any testimony
about bestiality."</TE>
<TE>   Good TV reporters, who are legion in this town, must hate this:
Sorry, ace, gotta yank you off that health-care expose you're working
on. Go cover the dog/sex/mauling death case today.</TE>
<TE>   News is by definition the unusual. It's not the stuff of the front
page that millions of kids go to school every day without being shot,
that thousands of planes take off and land without being crashed into
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   This case is unusual by every standard. But there are standards,
and there are limits, and if we haven't reached them yet, we can sure
see them from here.</TE>

<HD>Chief's Backers Pack Hearing</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Supporters urge retention of Parks, denounce Hahn and
question the police panel's fairness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of people who support the reappointment of Los Angeles
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks packed City Hall on Tuesday,
questioning the fairness of the Police Commission and the process the
panel will use to determine the chief's fate.</LD>
<LD>   For more than an hour, residents, clergy, community leaders and
elected officials trooped before the five-member commission and urged
the panel to retain the chief.</LD>
<LD>   They accused Mayor James K. Hahn of trying to sway the decision by
publicly opposing Parks' reappointment before the evaluation and said
the procedure for judging the chief's performance is riddled with
bias.</LD>
<TE>   "We cannot allow this kind of preemption to take place,
particularly when the whispers and the rumors are that the mayor has
three votes sewn up" on the commission, said U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters
(D-Los Angeles), who was once one of Hahn's most ardent supporters.</TE>
<TE>   She and other elected officials implied that commission President
Rick Caruso is inclined to back Hahn's position because Caruso wants
city backing for a large shopping development he is building in the
Fairfax district. That project has already received city approval and
is under construction at 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot see how he can be impartial," said the Rev. Frederick
Murph of Brookins Community AME Church.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso angrily objected to what he termed "subtle threats" and
implications that he and other commissioners will not be fair. He
called those suggestions "highly unfair and inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   "We are not beholden to the mayor," he said. "I would ask you not
to presume things that are not the case."</TE>
<TE>   Under the intense scrutiny of Parks' backers, the commission will
spend the next 30 to 45 days evaluating the chief's performance on
such issues as crime prevention and officer morale. The commission's
deliberations will largely take place outside public view, because
the panel intends to discuss Parks' fate in closed session. The City
Council can overturn the commission's decision with a vote of 10 out
of 15 members.</TE>
<TE>   Before the meeting Tuesday, about 150 people held a rally outside
Parker Center, the LAPD headquarters, chanting, "Five more years!"
and demanding that Parks stay on. The demonstrators then walked
across the street to City Hall to attend the commission meeting,
where they were joined by others.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people jammed the meeting room and poured out into the
hallway, forcing officials to move the gathering to the City Council
chambers.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, many of the chief's supporters asked the commission
to make the process more public and to explain how the panel will
arrive at its decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We are part of the voting public that is firmly discontented with
the manner in which the reappointment process has been handled," said
Bishop Charles E. Blake of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ.
"We hope that the commission will take its task seriously and not
allow this to be a slam-dunk for one interest or another."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional testimony of many of the chief's backers highlights
the political pressure on Hahn, who has been castigated by former
supporters for his opposition to the chief.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who attended part of the commission meeting to present
a community policing proposal, sat and listened as speakers accused
him of betraying his electoral base. Hahn did not mention Parks or
the chief's bid for another term.</TE>
<TE>   "You are the most arrogant and obnoxious individual I have ever
met in my entire life," said one man.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor did not respond. At times, he offered a thin smile, even
as people accused him of trying to sway the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have a weak back and weak knees so you will bow down to
what the mayor wants?" Danny Bakewell, president of the Brotherhood
Crusade, asked of the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Parks sat on the other side of the room from Hahn, also smiling
occasionally as people addressed the panel.</TE>
<TE>   He and the mayor did not speak, and Parks did not mention his
desire for reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   During Hahn's remarks, the mayor laid out a proposal to fully
reinstate the senior lead officers program, which deploys officers to
work as community liaisons and attend neighborhood meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has said the program, which Parks originally dismantled and
then brought back at the urging of then-Mayor Richard Riordan, is not
working consistently throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The senior lead officer program is L.A.'s signature community
policing program," he told the commission. "Right now, it's not
uniformly reinstated."</TE>
<TE>   The chief has said the officers are working according to the plan,
which allows them to be called onto patrol duty when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, Hahn said he wants the 168 senior lead officers to
work full time on community policing, and asked that the department
create a commander-level position to oversee the implementation.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also proposed that the senior leads work closely with
patrol officers but have specified job responsibilities related to
interacting with the community.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen residents testified in support of Hahn's
proposal, saying the senior lead officers give them a link to the
LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commissioners Sylvia Saucedo and David Cunningham joined
Hahn in recommending the changes to the existing senior lead officer
program.</TE>
<TE>   The commission asked the Police Department to prepare a report on
the program in 30 days.</TE>

<LD>Linda Parks has a degree in urban planning. She has been a Thousand
Oaks city planner and has sat on the City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Her avocation seems to be to keep lawyers employed. While issues
regarding development of land in the Conejo Valley are being debated
she hears nothing, sees nothing and knows nothing. After the
decisions are made she insists that they not be implemented. Many
times she and her followers seek legal recourse against the city.</LD>
<LD>   The city planners and the City Council do a good job of studying
the issues before they approve construction in the city. The Borchard
Road extension to Dos Vientos was finally opened in spite of
litigation. The Lang Ranch Dam will be built in spite of litigation.</LD>
<TE>   I notice that Parks does not claim that she defeated the placement
of a golf course in Hill Canyon. She is honest. The golf course was
not built because there was a requirement for a wetlands set aside in
order to enlarge the sewer plant.</TE>
<TE>   If Parks had voted for the upgrade of the sewer system the first
time it came up before the city there would not have been a sewer
spill and subsequent fines. There probably would not have been plans
to develop a golf course in the canyon and no subsequent litigation.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how many dollars her negativity has cost the city of
Thousand Oaks. I hope the County of Ventura has many lawyers and deep
pockets. If Parks is elected county supervisor it may need them.</TE>

voted to allow staff time to provide each commissioner with an
accurate land use element map and copies of exhibits relating to Site
I and Site C of the plan. Three commissioners wanted adequate time to
review those materials and the significant changes made to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Two commissioners, Farris and I, were removed by the City Council,
ostensibly for violating the Brown Act.</TE>
<TE>   Putting aside for the moment that there was no violation of the
public meeting law, what is lost in the fury of the council
majority's reaction to the commission's request for adequate
information given in the customary amount of time is that the plan no
longer includes the middle school land.</TE>
<TE>   Why was the middle school, Site C in the plan, removed? Because
that change would have resulted in the interrelated plan going to a
vote of the people. Why? Because in 1996, the Parks Initiative was
written by Linda Parks and adopted by the City Council, which
protects parkland from being developed without voter ratification.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Francis, co-author of SOAR, has offered his expert opinion
that Site I, the equestrian center that will be replaced by homes,
should go before the voters. Councilmen like Del Campo should take
heed. The underlying anger from thousands of the city's residents is
not, as he states, from a blind support of Parks, rather the
sentiment is, "How dare you run against the wishes of the voters?"</TE>
<TE>   Her supporters see that Parks has respect for the electorate and
faith in their collective wisdom. I support Parks because of her true
commitment to serving the public's interest. On March 5, please join
me in voting for Parks for Ventura County supervisor.</TE>

<TE>   D.A. Candidates' Campaign Tactics</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 21, a news conference was held at which time an elderly
community activist, recent grand marshal of the Santa Paula Christmas
Parade and Food Share volunteer, was unjustly crucified by the Totten
campaign. This character assassination by Greg Totten and his other
committee members was unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   This attack assumes that no one who has committed a crime can ever
be rehabilitated. If this were true, there would be no reason to
release anyone from jail.</TE>
<TE>   As a former probation officer, I find this assumption to be faulty
and far from the truth. Many people who violate the law never
re-offend. [Raul] Cervantes appears to be one of those who has paid
his dues to society and has made positive contributions to the
community.</TE>
<TE>   Approximately 14 years later, Totten's campaign humiliated this
72-year-old Latino community servant by once again dragging his name
and family through the mud. What was his new offense or crime? Was it
adding his name to others who have expressed support for Ron Bamieh
for district attorney? Wouldn't we as constituents rather hear about
each candidate's credentials and approaches to issues related to the
district attorney's office?</TE>
<TE>   My recommendation to Bamieh is to stay on the high road and not
stoop to the destructive, negative campaign tactics of the Totten
committee.</TE>

<TE>   Drugs have long been a killer of our children and a threat to the
safety of our communities. Having many decades of law enforcement
experience in battling the horrific scourge of illegal drugs, we were
amazed to learn that Ron Bamieh sought and then widely advertised the
endorsement of a convicted drug dealer in his "no-holds-barred" bid
to become district attorney. Even more amazing, however, has been
that some would now criticize his opponent, Greg Totten, for having
pointed this out.</TE>
<TE>   Let's be clear on the issue here. The person used in the Bamieh
endorsement ads was convicted of a felony drug offense--possession
for sale of significant quantities of cocaine (with a street value of
$35,000). Whether it was 10 months or 10 years ago does not lessen
the significance of candidate Bamieh's willingness to use this
convicted drug dealer in his bid to win Latino votes in his
television ads. If Bamieh didn't know about the man's record as a
drug dealer, he should have. And if he did know, it's even worse.</TE>
<TE>   Our top law enforcement officers must be above reproach and
certainly must not be willing to make alliances of convenience with
or use endorsements of convicted felons in an effort to advance their
political careers.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Bamieh and his supporters can try to "spin" this sordid
incident to somehow blame Totten for speaking out, but let's not let
this obvious effort to kill the messenger obscure the message: Drugs
kill people and destroy families. Our next district attorney must
prosecute drug dealers and certainly must not associate with
convicted drug dealers for political gain.</TE>

<TE>   We are so proud to be supporting Ron Bamieh, a candidate for
district attorney who has refrained from character assassination,
attack by innuendo, racism, insinuation and guilt by association
while slandering innocent citizens. His campaign is a reflection of
his integrity and principles.</TE>
<TE>   [Greg] Totten has cited a statement by Bamieh's father out of
context and in a totally misleading fashion. Surely Totten's people
are well aware that when Bamieh's father was asked if he would help
his son's campaign financially that his answer was highlighted by the
use of hyperbole, not meant to be taken literally. Surely, no one
thinks it would take $10 million to win any local office in Ventura
County. The comment was merely a loving father expressing his support
for his son in a dramatic fashion.</TE>
<TE>   We would prefer having a district attorney whose campaign was
financially assisted by his father in Northern California than one
who has received sizable contributions from local developers as
Totten has received from David Murdock.</TE>
<TE>   Attacking supporters of Bamieh in an attempt to besmirch their
reputation, and by association, that of the candidate, is the height
of intimidation and nastiness. This is not the type of ethical
behavior that we want to see in the district attorney of Ventura
County. It is disappointing to see Totten indulging in this conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh has shown courage, tenacity, determination, intelligence
and skill in pursuing murderers and spousal abusers. He successfully
obtained a conviction in a murder trial when all the other law
enforcement people had written the case off. He did so at
considerable cost to himself and his family as he was the target of
death threats from gangs involved. Bamieh is a man with integrity and
principle.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia, Eric, Frank Allison</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a recent article it was said that money donated to the campaign
for the district attorney's office had nearly reached $1 million for
[Ron] Bamieh (nearly all coming from his father) and that Greg
Totten's donations were far less. Some say that money is the root of
all evil. In this race, money is certainly the root of Bamieh's
search for a political power base. Without such money from his
father, Bamieh is no more or less qualified than many other
hard-working and dedicated deputy district attorneys in that office.
But with such money, Bamieh has paid his professional New York
promoters for their help to create false images through massive and
deceitful media ads.</TE>
<TE>   This race reminds me of a few years ago when Robert Lagomarsino
ran against [Michael] Huffington. Remember when Huffington spent
about $3.5 million (donated by himself, to himself) compared with
Lagomarsino's $500,000 which came from numerous donors. The ultimate
result was bad for all, particularly those in that congressional
district. A long-respected congressman's career ended and when his
opponent, Huffington, could not purchase the next political office,
he likewise slipped into political oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not repeat that mistake. I plead with the voters to consider
what is at stake and to not let money and Bamieh's New York political
machine dictate the outcome in Ventura County. But for whomever you
decide, go to the polls and vote.</TE>

<TE>   Community College Bond Measure</TE>
<TE>   Ballot Measure S, the bond measure for the Ventura County
Community College District, is a bad idea and would create a new,
unneeded and unwelcome tax burden on the property owners of Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   This additional tax burden would go on for 30 years. The new tax
that they are trying to impose on us is about $19 per $100,000 of
assessed value.</TE>
<TE>   As of November 2001, the median home value in Ventura County was
$287,000. Remember that this is not a static tax. If the value of
your property increases, and I don't foresee a real estate market
crash any time soon, your tax increases. If the college district
needs to raise the money for renovation and new construction, there
are other, more equitable ways for it to do so.</TE>
<TE>   First, let's look at some numbers. The college district claims an
enrollment of about 47,000 students. The population of Ventura County
is approximately 750,000. Assuming that all of the students are
Ventura County residents, which they are not, that would mean that
the colleges are utilized by about only 6.3% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   Should this measure pass, the many would be forced to pay for the
benefit of the few. Also, since many of the students paying resident
tuition are from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, they would
still be using our colleges and not having to pay the increase in the
property tax, as this measure affects the property taxes only in
Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   The most equitable way for the college district to raise the
needed money would be to increase tuition fees. This way, the people
reaping the benefits would be the ones paying for it.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, California resident students pay $11 per unit tuition
fee. Students from other states pay $130 and foreign students pay
$144. The $130-per-unit fee more accurately reflects the cost of
providing the educational services. This means that the taxpayers are
already paying more than 90% of the cost of educating the students.
And now the colleges want to stick their hands more deeply into our
pockets? I think not.</TE>
<TE>   Let's see how this would work. With 47,000 students, without
knowing the breakdown between full and part time, conservatively say
they average six units enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   That would be 282,000 units. Increase the enrollment fee by $2 per
unit, which is still way less than what it costs to go to a CSU or UC
[and] that would bring in $564,000 a semester, well over $1 million a
year just from the spring and fall semesters.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that much better than increasing our taxes again?</TE>
<TE>   In order to elicit sympathy from the public, the district sent out
a newsletter on the ballot measure that had a picture of a
"dilapidated 1940s-era Quonset hut." Since they didn't mention what
it was used for, I would imagine that they were hoping that people
would believe that it was an example of the classroom buildings.</TE>
<TE>   What they showed us was a building that's used for storing
gardening and maintenance equipment and is still quite serviceable
for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   We should let them know that we are not going to buy into this
sympathy ploy by voting no on Measure S.</TE>
<TE>   We have very little control over the taxes that are imposed on us,
as most of them come from Sacramento and Washington. This is one tax
that we can control and prevent from happening.</TE>

<TE>   New Development Near Ormond Beach</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's Ormond Beach is slipping away. It is being lost to
development one parcel at a time.</TE>
<TE>   There are already many acres of industrial plants and
vehicle-processing facilities. This area is covered with parking lots
and huge trucks.</TE>
<TE>   It is time to stop and look at the big picture.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, it means looking at the small amount of land that
still remains and being good stewards of this land. It means thinking
about the legacy that will be left for future generations. Once the
land is covered with buildings and paved with concrete, it is gone.</TE>
<TE>   If proper planning is done,  Ormond can enrich our lives. The
obvious assets are the coastal wetlands and the long stretch of open
beach with beautiful sunsets and wonderful views of the Channel
Islands.</TE>
<TE>   There are tremendous opportunities for educational study plus
environmental and marine research. There can be parkland with
elevated walkways, bridges over sensitive areas, viewing towers and
beach access for people of all ages to see and appreciate this jewel.
Any development must complement these uses.</TE>
<TE>   Piecemeal development proposals that would take away from this
potential are before city officials now.</TE>
<TE>   One is 38 acres for another vehicle-processing facility. Cars
would be brought into Ormond by train, through residential
neighborhoods, and trucked out.</TE>
<TE>   The other is a 50-acre Sysco distribution facility. Sysco is the
largest food service distribution organization in North America.
Sysco would generate an enormous amount of additional truck traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of these facilities needs to  be located by coastal
wetlands and beach land. Since all the trucks from these two
facilities will be using Highway 101, Rice Avenue near Highway 101
would be an appropriate location.</TE>
<TE>   Visioning and planning must be done. Oxnard City Council, staff
and residents must work together so Ormond Beach can be a very
special place.</TE>

<HD>Ailing Woman Rescued 9 Days After Falling</HD>
<DH>Emergencies: Police free diabetic, 64, who was trapped in
her home after husband was hospitalized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nine days, 64-year-old Amparo Prado lay wedged between her bed
and a wall, unable to lift herself. No one heard her screams. No one
heard her cries for food and water.</LD>
<LD>   No one knew this wheelchair-dependent diabetic was alone. No one,
except her husband, Agustin.</LD>
<LD>   But for eight days he lay in a hospital bed, intubated,
unconscious and unaware that his wife of 39 years was in trouble.</LD>
<TE>   On the ninth day, Agustin woke up. And he called out her name.</TE>
<TE>   Very early Tuesday, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Greg Staats pried open
the door to their modest Highland Park bungalow and shone a light
into her eyes. Amparo Prado blinked and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 16, with Amparo in the passenger seat, Agustin had driven
himself to the Kaiser facility on Sunset Boulevard. He was vomiting
and doubled over in pain.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency room doctors quickly diagnosed his uncommon and
life-threatening condition and rushed him into surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Before he was wheeled in, he told Amparo to take a taxi home and
promised to return home by last Wednesday to drive her to her next
dialysis treatment.</TE>
<TE>   After Agustin's surgery, the Kaiser staff helped Amparo into a
cab. Agustin was hooked up to a ventilator, unable to talk, heavily
sedated and unconscious most of the time, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He began to ask for his wife late this Sunday, but was still
disoriented, slipping in and out of consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Amparo, who has difficulty walking and uses a
wheelchair much of the time, fell soon after arriving home Feb. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Hungry and thirsty, she yelled over and over again for help.
"She's got the sweetest little voice and I'm sure no one could have
heard her," said Connie Matthews, a spokeswoman for Huntington
Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, where Amparo was taken by paramedics
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Complete darkness enveloped her at night. During the day, light
filtered through closed mini-blinds and drawn curtains. Their home is
a beaten-up square clapboard bungalow that couldn't be more than
1,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, the staff at Kaiser's dialysis center noticed that
Amparo had missed three appointments. But the Prados are an intensely
private and insulated couple, and she had missed sessions before.</TE>
<TE>   Although she had permission to go to another clinic, the center's
staff began to wonder what had happened to Amparo.</TE>
<TE>   A Kaiser spokeswoman said their social service workers had noticed
the couple's reclusive nature and Amparo's health problems and had
asked Los Angeles County social workers to conduct a home visit. But
no one had answered the door during three visits beginning in
January.</TE>
<TE>   The workers couldn't call either. The Prados don't have a phone.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one for a while," Agustin said from his hospital bed
Tuesday. "But my wife said, 'No phones, I don't want to be answering
phones.'"</TE>
<TE>   Their emergency contacts are each other. Agustin had recently
retired as a roofer to care for Amparo full time. He made her Cream
of Wheat for breakfast and her favorite picadillo "or whatever else
she wanted" for supper. He bathed her and took her to doctor
appointments.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day we would argue like cats and dogs with each other," he
joked. "But it would only last 15 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Agustin said that they were content to rely on each other and
fearful to seek government help because they are undocumented
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Their neighbors, in all the years they have lived on North Avenue
63, could recall waving to the Prados only a few times. They never
spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so bad, we have lived here for years, but never talked,
said Cristina Membrano, 51, whose backyard is across from the Prados'
kitchen, with a tall, cinder-block wall between them.</TE>
<TE>   When Agustin could finally explain that Amparo was alone, the
hospital staff contacted police.</TE>
<TE>   At 10:30 p.m. Monday, Officer Gabriel Rivas arrived at the
darkened, sealed house. He called his supervisor and Sgt. Staat
arrived with paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   In the kitchen, they saw a bird cage. The bird inside lay dead. A
makeshift altar on the table included a rosary and statue of the
Virgin of Guadalupe.</TE>
<TE>   The stench in the house was the smell of death, Staats recalled,
and he braced himself for the worst as he worked his way through the
tiny, pitch-dark rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "In between the bed and the wall I saw a face," Staats said. She
looked at me, blinked her eyes and then she smiled.... She had a weak
smile, but it was an obvious smile."</TE>
<TE>   Her first words were to ask about her husband.</TE>
<TE>   The couple lived a nightmare that many older people dread, said
Donna Benton, director of the Los Angeles Caregiver Resource Center.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a fear for any older adult or couple trying to live on
their own," Benton said. "What happens if I call and no one is at
home? What happens if I become sick?"</TE>
<TE>   Amparo and Agustin are to be reunited at Kaiser Permanente's Los
Angeles Medical Center as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   Amparo is dehydrated and disoriented and was undergoing dialysis
Tuesday at Kaiser's West Los Angeles hospital, a spokeswoman said.
She is expected to recover.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors who examined her said that in some ways it was fortunate
that she did not have food during the ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   Without dialysis and medication, her body would have been unable
to rid itself of toxins.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a mystery how she survived so long. A person can
survive two to three days without fluids. They can go a long time
without eating, but they have to drink," said Dr. Fred Alexander,
medical director for Kaiser's West Los Angeles Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Agustin remained hospitalized after surgery that repaired a severe
rupture of his esophagus.</TE>
<TE>   But now they will be together again--albeit in sickness--this
older couple without children, without friends or neighbors to check
on them, without a phone.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart was scrunched without her," Agustin said from his
intensive care bed, an oxygen tube taped to his nostrils. "We are
always together, we are never apart."</TE>
<TE>   The moment he sees her, Agustin said, he will tell his Amparo, "I
love you so much. Please forgive me. I will never leave you again."</TE>

<HD>Insurance Commissioner Race Focuses on Industry Donations</HD>
<DH>Politics: Front-runner Calderon has an edge in advertising
because he accepts insurers' money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Two years after scandal drove former Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush from office, the insurance industry is trying to pick his
successor, pouring more than $1.5 million into the campaign of
Assemblyman Tom Calderon, the only candidate willing to take its
money.</LD>
<LD>   The same companies that became embroiled in the scandal that
eventually forced Quackenbush to resign have contributed heavily to
Calderon, each pumping thousands into his election effort through
their agents and political action committees.</LD>
<LD>   The huge infusion of industry dollars has made the two-term
assemblyman from Montebello the odds-on favorite in the Democratic
primary and turned the contest into a vitriolic slugfest between
Calderon and two formidable opponents, Tom Umberg and John Garamendi.</LD>
<TE>   Both Garamendi and Umberg borrowed liberally to raise enough money
to match Calderon on the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   "The overriding issue in this race is who can best restore
integrity to the Department of Insurance," Umberg said. "All three of
us are telling the voters, 'I can.'"</TE>
<TE>   On television the three political veterans use a soft sell. Umberg
plays up his service as a colonel in the Army Reserves, hoping to
capitalize on the patriotism engendered by the Sept. 11 attacks.
Calderon presents himself as the man who will best protect Joe
Consumer. Garamendi, the state's first elected commissioner, tells
viewers that he transformed the office into a consumer protection
agency only to see it sullied by Quackenbush.</TE>
<TE>   Rhetoric Gets Ugly on Campaign Trail</TE>
<TE>   But on the campaign trail the rhetoric is ugly. Calderon bears the
brunt as he is attacked repeatedly for accepting industry
contributions. Even the underfinanced, lesser-known Democratic
candidate in the race, Los Angeles attorney William Winslow, gets in
a few licks.</TE>
<TE>   "We need somebody who is willing to stand up to corporate abuse,
unfairness and lawlessness," Winslow tells a San Francisco radio
audience, "and I don't think it's realistic to think you can do that
if you take big contributions from insurance companies."</TE>
<TE>   As the race stretches into its final days, Calderon is being
forced to explain the industry contributions that account for nearly
60% of the $2.47 million he has collected. Among his biggest
contributors are those connected with the Quackenbush debacle. From
Farmers Insurance and its agents Calderon got $180,404; 21st Century,
$200,000; Allstate Insurance, $70,000; agents for State Farm,
$34,400; and Fireman's Fund, $20,200.</TE>
<TE>   From Mercury Insurance, a company that was not caught up in the
scandal but did sponsor legislation carried by Calderon, the
assemblyman collected $150,000. Keith Parker, an investment partner
of the company's president, donated an additional $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the donations, Calderon insists that the consumer is his
first consideration. "This job was created ... to protect the
consumer, and if you're an insurance company and you sign a contract,
I'm going to hold you to it. Period," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials say they gave to Calderon because they believe
he will be fair. "He has proven he can balance the interests of both
insurance consumers and the industry," said Mary K. Flynn, Farmers'
media relations manager.</TE>
<TE>   For Umberg, an attorney and former legislator, and Garamendi, a
five-time candidate for statewide office, the strategy is to sell
themselves on television and use news conferences, debates and
interviews to hammer away at the contribution issue.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to remain a dirty little secret," Garamendi said
earlier this month. "I'm going to do everything I can in the
remaining weeks of this campaign to make Calderon's campaign
contributions an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Calderon, who has spent $45,000 on researching his opponents,
accuses Umberg and Garamendi of duplicity. What about the big
donations Umberg accepted from Indian gaming interests in an
unsuccessful race for attorney general, a job that would require him
to give legal advice on Indian compacts? And what of Garamendi's
promise in 1990 not to accept insurance money, only to be broken when
he asked the industry for contributions to pay off debts from a
failed governor's campaign?</TE>
<TE>   Calderon said Garamendi and Umberg have their own explaining to
do--Garamendi about his handling of the 1991 Executive Life Insurance
Co. insolvency and Umberg about the $243,000 he collected from
lawyers who sue insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at how Garamendi and Umberg are funding their
campaigns, it's all rich friends and rich relatives," Calderon said.
"I don't have any rich friends who can loan me money. "</TE>
<TE>   In past years it got scant attention, but this year the insurance
commissioner contest is high-profile, riding the wave of publicity
generated by the actions of Quackenbush.</TE>
<TE>   The attention comes at a critical time. The next insurance
regulator will take office as the industry is still reeling from
Sept. 11 and facing demands for payouts. He will inherit a crisis in
the workers' compensation industry, where coverage for injured
workers is threatened by a string of insolvencies. He will have to
decide numerous requests for rate increases from companies that were
flush with investment earnings during the highflying 1990s but now
contend that their reserves have fallen.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the statewide offices that are up this year, outside of
governor, the insurance commissioner is the most important," said
state Senate Insurance Committee Chairwoman Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough). "If there ever was a time when we needed someone in
office who had their pulse on protecting the consumer, it's now."</TE>
<TE>   Quackenbush Favorite Foil for the Candidates</TE>
<TE>   For all the candidates, the favorite foil is Quackenbush, the
twice-elected Republican insurance commissioner who made secret
agreements with insurance companies that required them to donate to a
private foundation he created. In return, Quackenbush agreed not to
examine their handling of Northridge earthquake claims. Funds from
the foundation were then used to buy commercials that could improve
his name recognition for a possible governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon reminds voters that he was on the Assembly committee that
uncovered Quackenbush's conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi calls Quackenbush the inspiration for his candidacy
because he wants to restore the consumer protections he says
Quackenbush dismantled.</TE>
<TE>   Umberg pledges to abide by an ethics code posted on his Web site,
which he says will ensure that the excesses of Quackenbush will never
be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Umberg and Garamendi label Calderon another Quackenbush because of
his acceptance of industry contributions. Calderon maintains that,
like Quackenbush, Garamendi is tainted by scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi has been accused in two lawsuits of breaching his
responsibility to Executive Life policyholders when he sold the
insurance business to a French bank that used fronts to skirt
American law. He also sold off assets of the company at a time when
they were undervalued. They later brought billions of dollars in
profits to their buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi, who maintains that he never knew of the bank's use of
fronts, has contended that he had no choice but to sell in order to
preserve as much of the assets as possible during a period of
economic turbulence. He said that, as a result, 92% of policyholders
got 100% of their contract. Executive Life activist Maureen Marr,
however, contends that Garamendi's actions resulted in a $4.7-billion
shortfall in account values, causing policyholders to suffer huge
losses.</TE>
<TE>   While the Democrats battle it out, the Republicans conduct a
primary that is gentlemanly by contrast. With no money for
television, they vie for endorsements from Republican organizations.
The candidates include Gary Mendoza, a Los Angeles lawyer and former
director of the California Department of Corporations; Wes Bannister,
an insurance broker; and Stefan "Watchdog" Stitch, an insurance
auditor who legally changed his middle name to Watchdog so he could
use it on the ballot.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>A Shoestring Campaign Limps Along</HD>
<DH>GOP stalwart Bill Jones finds himself buried by
multimillionaire rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is where 30 years of service to the Republican party got Bill
Jones: standing before a lectern in Reseda, flanked by his wife and
seven UCLA fraternity members, delivering a speech into thin air.</LD>
<LD>   It's a common scene from Jones' gubernatorial campaign, as the
candidate remains locked in third place in fund-raising and the polls
a week before the primary. There are few campaign rallies; often, as
in Reseda, a lone reporter is his only audience. But he delivers the
pre-written speeches anyway, invariably beginning with the words
"Thank you for coming."</LD>
<LD>   Little more than a year ago, Jones--the only statewide Republican
officeholder--had a clear field in the GOP primary. Then two
multimillionaires with tenuous Republican credentials and no
experience in statewide campaigns jumped into the fray, and Jones, an
assemblyman for 12 years before becoming secretary of state, was
buried beneath their avalanche of money.</LD>
<TE>   "He's got to be the most frustrated man in California," GOP
consultant Dan Schnur said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones certainly sounds like it. Although he has a reputation for
civility, Jones in the closing days of the race has leveled
devastating daily attacks on his rivals.</TE>
<TE>   He says they think the Republican party is "for sale." He
criticizes former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan for not
controlling his Democratic wife, and financier Bill Simon Jr. for
routinely missing primary elections: "There's no excuse--being too
busy making money to vote." He ruminates on whether he should have
passed up a chance to run for a safe seat in Congress instead of for
governor--but quickly says he made the right choice.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, he entered the stretch run of his shoestring
campaign--a seven-day plane tour of California in his Cessna
six-seater, which Jones flies himself. He touched down in San Diego
on Tuesday afternoon and devoted the majority of his speech to
attacking Riordan, whose record he plans to criticize every one of
the remaining days before the primary.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary of state and his loyalists contend that he can still
win, even though a Times poll released Monday showed him gaining no
ground on Riordan and Simon, who are in a dead heat for the
nomination. With the two multimillionaires bashing each other on the
airwaves in the race's final week, Jones insists, voters will be
disgusted with the novices and look to his experience on primary day.</TE>
<TE>   Following a basic rule of politics, candidate Jones does not even
tolerate the idea of defeat. In seemingly every appearance, he
declares: "I will win this primary."</TE>
<TE>   Six days from election day, the race is still volatile. But
analysts say Jones' talk of victory may be wishful.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything's possible," said GOP analyst Allan Hoffenblum, who is
backing Riordan. Still, he said, "It appears from what I'm hearing
that it's a two-candidate race" between the more moderate Riordan and
the more conservative Simon.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain agreed. "It comes down
to a real choice between a conservative candidate and a more moderate
candidate," he said. "Jones doesn't add anything to that dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   That's not true, Jones says: He has his experience in state
politics--his entire adult life.</TE>
<TE>   Active in Republican Politics Since College</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Reagan appointee to the state water commission, Jones
grew up on his family ranch outside Fresno. At Cal State Fresno
during the turbulence of the 1960s, Jones was active in Republican
politics. He headed the Fresno chapter of Young Republicans for
Richard Nixon and was later recruited into a program to get farmers
into the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Jones lost his first race for the Assembly, but won a seat in 1982
and has not lost an election since. He served as minority leader,
then secretary of state. But his standing in this race was
complicated when, during the spring 2000 presidential primaries, he
shifted his support from George W. Bush to John McCain, whose stance
on campaign finance reform comes closest to Jones'.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, the Bush White House talked to Riordan about
running against Jones in the primary. He jumped in, as did Simon. The
secretary of state found his campaign stalled, unable to raise money
from bedrock Republican donors.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' distaste for his two chief rivals is evident, though he
goes out of his way to call Simon "a nice fellow." During the
Republican debates, GOP consultant Schnur said, Jones' expression
reminded him of a famous "Saturday Night Live" sketch during the 1988
presidential election, when actor Jon Lovitz, playing Democrat
Michael Dukakis, watched comedian Dana Carvey's George Bush babble
nonsensically. "I can't believe I'm losing to this guy," Lovitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The Reseda event earlier this month was a window into Jones'
underdog campaign. It was the opening shot of a bus tour, but the
rickety yellow school bus was 90 minutes late pulling into the
departure point, the parking lot of a Woodland Hills mall. During the
delay, a security guard tried to chase out the reporter and
photographers waiting for Jones to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   The bus finally arrived, along with the candidate and his wife,
Maurine--who rose at 3:45 a.m. to get from Fresno to Woodland
Hills--and a Chevy Blazer jammed with seven members of the same UCLA
fraternity to which Jones' nephew belongs. The students slipped into
Jones for Governor T-shirts and clambered upon the bus, followed by
the secretary of state and his wife.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast between Jones' humble yellow school bus and one
chartered weeks before by Riordan--with a leather couch, stereo
system, VCR, DVD player--was lost on no one.</TE>
<TE>   "That bus Riordan had," Jones said. "I think we could fit our
whole staff and still have room for the press."</TE>
<TE>   Ideas for State's Transportation Woes</TE>
<TE>   Unprompted, Jones began to hold forth, talking steadily for 30
minutes about the intricacies of the state's water policy, its
transportation woes--he favors using high-speed trains that were
first used in Spain and now are utilized in Washington state--and the
dynamics of the race.</TE>
<TE>   He scoffed at the comparison Simon's supporters make to another
political novice who mounted a longshot conservative campaign for
governor--Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Reagan speaking to Republican dinners two years before
he started running," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to recall Riordan's schedule that day, and remembered the
former mayor was speaking to a local Lincoln club--a Republican
organization. Jones began to rattle off the Lincoln clubs he had
spoken to just in the past week--Madera, Redding. He trailed off.</TE>
<TE>   "Riordan's done a couple of events," Jones said. "I've done
hundreds. I'm not looking for thanks for that. I'm just saying the
party has to be more than a vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   He volunteered that he had a chance to run for an open
congressional seat in the Central Valley late last year, one that he
could have easily won. But he never gave it much consideration, he
insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "To desert your party and leave it to Simon and Riordan, who can't
beat [incumbent Gov. Gray] Davis, it's not the right thing to do,"
Jones said as his bus rattled through the San Fernando Valley toward
Reseda High School. "This is the right race to be in."</TE>

<HD>Mayoral Vote Is Reversed for 2nd Time</HD>
<DH>Compton: Appeals court reinstates Eric Perrodin, nullifying Omar
Bradley's return to office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The running melodrama of Compton politics took another turn Tuesday
when an appeals court judge reinstated the elected mayor, thereby ending
the brief return of former Mayor Omar Bradley, who had been restored to
office by a lower court earlier in the month.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the 2nd District Court of Appeal blocks, at least
temporarily, a Feb. 8 ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith
Chirlin that replaced Mayor Eric Perrodin with his opponent, Bradley. A
short time after Tuesday's stay, the pro-Bradley City Council approved
paying $840,000 of Bradley's legal fees, as well as $43,000 in back
wages.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling again plunged Compton into political chaos--a state that is
becoming close to the status quo in the city of 93,000, which occupies a
pocket of southeastern Los Angeles County. Under the decision, Perrodin
will be reinstated as mayor Thursday, pending the final outcome of the
appeal.</LD>
<TE>   In his appeal, Perrodin claims Chirlin exceeded her authority and
abused her discretion by taking away 306 of his votes and giving them to
Bradley. Bradley has been mayor since Chirlin ousted Perrodin earlier
this month.</TE>
<TE>   "The city's in limbo," said Yvonne Arceneaux, the only member of the
City Council who supported Perrodin. "We're without a mayor. We're
without leadership, and it's really unfortunate." She noted that the city
has two city managers and two assistant city managers on the payroll, the
legacy of its in-again, out-again mayors.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin ruled that Perrodin unfairly benefited from having his name
appear first on the June 5 ballot, citing the "primacy effect" theory put
forth by an expert witness. That theory held that some voters cast
ballots for Perrodin only because his name appeared before Bradley's.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorneys argued that Compton officials had erred by not
randomly selecting the order of candidate names on the June ballot. The
names appeared in the same order in the primary election.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court justices said the primacy effect theory--and
whether it was properly applied--was among several "significant and
substantial issues" that need to be decided before changing the outcome
of the election. Perrodin beat Bradley by 281 votes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy and elated," said Perrodin in a telephone interview. "But
I'm more elated for the citizens of Compton. [Chirlin's] judge's ruling
disenfranchised the voters of Compton. She imposed her will on the
voters."</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin said he had sought the urgent stay from the appeal court
despite the turmoil he knew it could cause.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probable that some people will be upset about this," he said.
"I'm trying to change the image of Compton. I don't want to do anything
that would tarnish the image."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley, who served two terms as mayor before losing to Perrodin,
could not be reached for comment. Councilman Amen Rahh said Bradley and
his family were "devastated" by the reversal of fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley was convening a City Council meeting Tuesday afternoon when
his son, Omar Bradley Jr., dashed in through a side door and whispered
the news of the ruling to his father. The council decided to adjourn to a
closed session, which is allowed for discussing legal or personnel
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Before the closed session could begin, City Atty. Legrand H. Clegg II
was escorted out by security guards after saying he felt threatened by
the younger Bradley, who had been seen making faces and pointing at him.
Clegg was escorted to his car by sheriff's deputies, who were ordered to
keep watch on his house overnight, said Capt. Cecil Rhambo, commander of
the sheriff's Compton substation.</TE>
<TE>   When the council reconvened Tuesday night, Rahh and another council
member charged that Clegg had "lured" Bradley to file the claims for
legal fees and back pay to give Perrodin ammunition for his legal fight.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said courts of appeal grant stays on such issues if they
believe there exists a substantial probability that the appealing party
will prevail. Courts also consider whether irreparable harm will result
if a lower court ruling stands.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the court took the unusual step of considering Compton
residents in their analysis, saying its decision would "serve to prevent
irreparable harm to the voters of the city of Compton."</TE>
<TE>   The quick action by the court was expected by legal experts, given the
unusual basis of Chirlin's ruling. Some experts said Tuesday's decision
sends a strong signal that an appeals court is likely to overturn
Chirlin.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact they moved quickly is not surprising," said Rick Hasen, a
Loyola University elections law professor who once served as a consultant
in Compton. "Every day that goes by makes it harder to go back to the
status quo with Perrodin as mayor."</TE>
<TE>   The decision Tuesday came one day after lawyers debated the case in a
downtown Los Angeles courtroom packed with about 90 supporters of Bradley
and Perrodin. Dozens of others waited outside.</TE>
<TE>   During the hourlong debate, the jurists seemed skeptical of the
primacy effect theory as they posed questions to Bradley's attorney,
Bradley Hertz.</TE>
<TE>   Associate Justice Reuben Ortega asked why the primacy effect didn't
seem to help another candidate in the primary election who was listed
above Perrodin and Bradley but got fewer votes.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega also asked if the primacy effect would now make all elections
open to legal challenge. Hertz replied that the theory could be used to
contest narrow victories.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding Justice Vaino Spencer asked Hertz the population of the Ohio
county that the expert witness, Ohio State University professor Jon
Krosnick, had used in the study that he applied to Compton. At one point
Spencer seemed incredulous when Hertz said that differences in
demographics wouldn't affect the analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised you say that," she said to Hertz, claiming that
Krosnick had noted demographics as an important factor in his initial
study.</TE>
<TE>   Hertz responded by saying that Krosnick's research had evolved since
his initial study, and that demographic factors can now be factored into
any analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer also wanted to know how much Krosnick prepared before

<HD>Riordan Seeks to Rev Up Campaign</HD>
<DH>Politics: Former mayor puts an upbeat spin on the loss of his
once-large lead in latest poll and directs new attacks at hard-charging
Bill Simon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling to regain his footing in a race long seen as his to
lose, gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan found himself Tuesday
trying to convince supporters he finds it exciting that his solid lead in
the Republican primary has withered into a dead heat.</LD>
<LD>   Coursing across Southern California, territory that his backers
presumed would be securely in his column by now, he pounded his chief
rival, Pacific Palisades businessman Bill Simon Jr., and cast himself as
a more loyal Republican. As much as anything else, however, he fought to
portray himself as optimistic that he will defeat Simon.</LD>
<LD>   A Times poll published Tuesday found Riordan and Simon in a tie, one
week before Tuesday's primary. Once tied with Gov. Gray Davis in a
hypothetical November matchup, Riordan now trails the Democratic
incumbent.</LD>
<TE>   To regain its edge, Riordan's campaign was producing new anti-Simon
television spots Tuesday and making last-minute changes to the
candidate's schedule, staging a pep rally at the Riordan-owned Original
Pantry restaurant in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing upbeat, the former Los Angeles mayor cast his reversal of
fortune in a favorable light.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting close, which makes it exciting," Riordan said. "We'll
have a heck of a week. We'll have a lot of fun. But in the end, people
are going to know that Gray Davis fears Dick Riordan more than any
Republican, so we're going to beat him."</TE>
<TE>   But friends and advisors to Riordan suggested that beneath the
optimism there was deep unease within his campaign about the state of the
race.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate and his wife, Nancy Daly Riordan, "thought it would be a
cakewalk," but "it hasn't turned out that way," said their close friend
Eli Broad.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't assume anything anymore," Broad said.</TE>
<TE>   Some key Riordan supporters have privately urged the wealthy candidate
to tap his personal fortune to buy more television ads. Riordan has
refused; his campaign has argued that contributions could dry up if
donors assume he is financing his own campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Strategically, Riordan has settled on a two-pronged approach for the
final stretch.</TE>
<TE>   One part is a new effort to appeal to conservative voters--the group
most apt to turn out in a GOP primary. At stops in Fontana, Los Angeles
and Santa Barbara on Tuesday, he touted his support for tax cuts and the
death penalty--touchstone Republican issues.</TE>
<TE>   The other part is a full-bore attack on Simon. Standing beneath a
"Steaks &amp; Chops" sign in his restaurant, Riordan said it was
"unbelievable" that Simon had attacked his GOP credentials.</TE>
<TE>   "The shirt I'm wearing has been a Republican longer than Bill Simon,"
Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, formerly an independent, first registered as a Republican in
1992, Riordan said. Riordan pointed to a blown-up photocopy of Simon's
1984 voter registration card. Riordan read the line next to a box checked
by Simon on the card: "I do not wish to enroll in any political party."</TE>
<TE>   He tried to rally Republicans to his side by attributing Simon's rise
in the polls to the $8-million barrage of TV ads that Davis has run
against Riordan. The incumbent, Riordan said, is essentially trying to
pick his GOP opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot let Gray Davis kidnap the Republican primary," Riordan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the restaurant, the governor's pit-bull strategist, Garry
South, distributed an unflattering news story about Riordan to reporters.
To avoid confrontation, Riordan's bodyguard and aides escorted the
candidate through the back door of the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Simon stepped up his attacks on Riordan's loyalty to the
GOP. He released a statement hammering Riordan for supporting a federal
tax hike under President Bill Clinton. He also renewed his broader attack
on Riordan for supporting a host of Democrats over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the Riordan criticism, Simon consultant Jeff Flint said
it was "way too late for Dick Riordan to try to refurbish his Republican
credentials."</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear the voters have decided Dick Riordan is a liberal, and
Bill Simon is a conservative Republican, and that's why Bill Simon is
surging in all the polls," Flint said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon campaigned Monday in Oakland and the Central Valley. In
Oakland's Chinatown, he darted into dim sum restaurants and pastry shops,
walking past rows of ducks and stacked fruit. He shook hands with fry
cooks, waitresses and bewildered-looking restaurant customers. Passersby
stopped to gawk, many asking, "Who's he?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon invoked the names of fellow Republicans from Ronald Reagan to
Rudolph Giuliani, his showcase supporter.</TE>
<TE>   "How's business?" Simon asked a restaurant owner. "Well, I'm behind
the small businessman. Do you want less taxes? I'm the only candidate who
plans to balance the budget without raising taxes."</TE>
<TE>   In most encounters, Simon--a first-time candidate--appeared stiff and
tried for one-liners. When he reached to shake hands with one woman, she
asked: "Are you leaving?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm just going where they tell me," he replied. "I'm just a
candidate. I do what I'm told."</TE>
<TE>   A supporter pointed out that there were three banks on every Chinatown
corner. "Chinese people, we like to save our money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not just gambling?" Simon asked.</TE>
<TE>   The supporter laughed nervously and Simon slapped him on the back,
good-old-boy style.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, I know," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The third Republican candidate, Secretary of State Bill Jones,
campaigned Tuesday in San Diego, where he renewed his own attacks against
Riordan. But with only $300,000 worth of TV spots airing in the
campaign's final week, his message is being largely drowned out by
roughly quadruple the ad exposure for Riordan, Simon and Davis--a crucial
factor in a state as large as California.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan got some outside help Tuesday from a moderate Republican group
that launched a TV spot in Sacramento attacking Simon over his family's
involvement in a failed savings and loan.</TE>
<TE>   Simon sat on the board of Western Federal Savings &amp; Loan, but says he
was monitoring his family's investment, not managing the thrift. He
blames its collapse in the early 1990s--which cost taxpayers $92 million
and his family's investment firm another $40 million--on a premature
takeover by federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   But the ad suggests that Simon's negligence was to blame and accuses
the candidate of being "too careless with your money."</TE>
<TE>   The 15-second spot, airing only in Sacramento at this point, was
placed by the Republican Leadership Council, a Washington group that
seeks to elect fiscally conservative, socially moderate Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel Mr. Simon is not the best candidate for the Republican Party
in California to grow and thrive," said Allen Raymond, executive director
of the group.</TE>
<TE>   As for Riordan, although he is never mentioned in the spot, "I think
he has the kind of record that would really be good for the Republican
Party in California," Raymond said. "Also, we think he is the best
candidate to challenge and defeat Gov. Davis in the fall."</TE>

<HD>Vaccine for AIDS Shows Promise</HD>
<DH>Health: Human trials indicate it may keep HIV infections in check,
but clear result is years away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>The first human studies of a highly anticipated proposed AIDS
vaccine indicate that it produces a response in the immune system that
may help keep HIV infections in check, researchers said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   If the vaccine ultimately is proved to work--something that won't be
known for several years--it would be given to people after they are
infected. The aim would be to limit the ability of the virus to replicate
itself, keeping it at a manageable level and slowing--perhaps
blocking--the onset of AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Merck, which is developing the vaccine, announced the
results of studies showing that the vaccine can sharply reduce HIV
replication in monkeys.</LD>
<TE>   Those results seemed so promising that Dr. Emilio A. Emini of Merck
Research Laboratories was asked to report on human studies at the Ninth
Annual Retrovirus Conference taking place here--even though the studies
are still at a very early stage.</TE>
<TE>   The first trials in a relatively small number of people have shown
that the proposed vaccine is apparently safe. The vaccine also has the
same type of impact on the immune system in humans as previously seen in
monkeys, Emini said, although the trials were in people who are not
infected with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   "We are encouraged," Emini told conference attendees, but he cautioned
that it will be at least a year before the company finishes the current
safety trials of the vaccine. If those prove successful, further testing
could require an additional four years at least, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Gold, vice president of the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative, called the results "significant findings," although he too
cautioned that "there are still a lot of details that need to be fleshed
out."</TE>
<TE>   "Developing a vaccine is a lot more complicated than developing a
drug," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still a long way from having a vaccine that would protect
people," said Lee Klosinski of AIDS Project L.A. But Merck's willingness
to invest so much money on the early trials "shows they have tremendous
confidence they are on to something," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers were highly optimistic about the development of an HIV
vaccine when the AIDS epidemic was first noted 20 years ago, but that
optimism soon gave way to growing pessimism.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other deadly viruses that have yielded to the efforts of
vaccine researchers, the AIDS virus has the ability to rapidly change its
surface coat. The changes allow the virus to elude antibodies the immune
system might direct against an infection.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that trait, many vaccine researchers have abandoned--or at
least postponed--hopes of a vaccine that would block an infection
altogether. Instead, the emphasis of Emini and other researchers has been
on finding a vaccine that would control viral replication after an
infection has already occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The body controls such infections using specialized white blood cells
called CD4 and CD8 cells. These immune cells attack and destroy
HIV-infected cells, thereby limiting spread of the virus to other cells.
This process is called cell-mediated immunity.</TE>
<TE>   The Merck team has concentrated on the DNA that serves as the
blueprint for a protein called gag. The protein itself is harmless but is
part of the HIV virus.</TE>
<TE>   In one project, the researchers have incorporated the gene that tells
the body how to produce gag into a circle of DNA that can be injected
directly into muscle. Once in the body, the gene stimulates production of
the gag protein. That, in turn, triggers an immune response--boosting
production of CD4 and CD8 cells that then attack cells infected by HIV.
Researchers call this approach naked DNA.</TE>
<TE>   In a second project, they incorporated the gag gene into a type of
virus called an adenovirus. Normally the adenovirus causes colds, but the
ones used in the research have been modified so that they do not produce
disease. Again, the gag gene stimulates production of gag protein.
Typically, genes incorporated into a delivery mechanism such as a virus
stimulate a stronger immune response than naked DNA.</TE>
<TE>   The team reported last month that they could prime monkeys' immune
systems with the naked DNA, then boost the immune response with the
adenovirus vector. Monkeys given this prime-boost regimen had
significantly lower levels of a monkey AIDS virus in their blood than did
unvaccinated monkeys.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits were attributed to increased levels of CD4 and CD8 cells
stimulated by the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   In the human experiments on which Emini reported Tuesday, naked DNA
and the adenovirus vector were each administered alone.</TE>
<TE>   With the naked DNA, Emini found that 16 of 38 volunteers showed
increased levels of CD4 and CD8 cells after 30 weeks. "That shows that
the immune system is 'seeing' the DNA," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With the adenovirus vector, he said, about two-thirds of the
recipients showed increased levels of the immune cells.</TE>
<TE>   The team has begun giving the prime-boost regimen to some uninfected
volunteers, but does not yet have any results, he added. They will also
soon begin giving the vaccine to HIV-positive volunteers. The initial
safety trials will include at least 600 people.</TE>
<TE>   One potential impediment to the vaccine's success is that many
potential recipients already have some immunity to the adenovirus that is
used as a vector. Presumably, at some time in the past they have had a
cold caused by that particular adenovirus. But Emini said he is hopeful
they can overcome that immunity by using higher doses of the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   The Merck team hopes that their approach will prove more effective
than the other potential vaccines that are now in or nearing clinical
trials. One of them, the AIDSVax vaccine, is a more traditional vaccine
that is designed to produce antibodies to the viral coat. It has been
tested in nearly 8,000 volunteers, and results of those trials are
expected later this year.</TE>

<HD>Army's Reality Game Takes a Deadly Turn</HD>
<DH>Military: A soldier dies, another is wounded in misunderstanding
over N.C. training exercise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROBBINS, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>Saturday afternoon was chilly and windy--too cold, Deputy Randall
Butler later told colleagues, for anyone to be riding around in the back
of a pickup truck.</LD>
<LD>   So the second time the Moore County sheriff's deputy saw the green
open-bed truck just outside the limits of this tiny town, he pulled over
the driver and two passengers--each unshaven and wearing blue jeans and
flannel shirts.</LD>
<LD>   Within minutes Butler fired, fearing for his life, after the
passengers moved to attack him, one shouting to the other: "Shoot him!
Get the gun! Shoot him! He's got a gun!" One man was killed and another
seriously injured.</LD>
<TE>   What Butler did not know--what he had little way of knowing--was that
he had killed 1st Lt. Tallas Tomeny and wounded Sgt. Stephen Phelps. They
thought they were playing the war game known as "Robin Sage," part of
their intensive final examination to earn the coveted Green Beret of the
U.S. Army's Special Forces. Their driver, Charles Leiber, a civilian
volunteer who had been placed in the squad car for questioning before the
shooting, was unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   To a degree, the Army conceded such an incident may have been more
likely in light of the high alert that police everywhere have been on
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. At the same time, the Army
considers such training exercises vital preparation for conflicts such as
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Moore County Dist. Atty. Garland N. Yates said no charges would be
brought against anyone. He noted that Butler had "absolutely no
knowledge" that the men were in a training exercise and the soldiers
believed Butler was playing a role in the war game.</TE>
<TE>   The episode, called a "fatal misunderstanding" by Army officials at a
news conference Tuesday at Ft. Bragg, highlighted a breakdown in
communication between the military and local law enforcement officials.
The failure to communicate appeared deeper when Robbins' Police Chief
D.L. Brown said Tuesday afternoon that one of his officers had a similar
encounter a week earlier with troops participating in the same 19-day
training exercise.</TE>
<TE>   In that incident, just a few miles from the fatal shooting, Officer
J.D. Garner pulled over a truck towing a trailer with a canvas cover. At
least one soldier thought Garner was taking part in the war game and
fired on him using blank ammunition. Garner, a former Robin Sage
volunteer, realized what was happening and held his fire.</TE>
<TE>   In this traffic stop, the soldiers in the back of the covered trailer
were in uniform. Brown said Garner informed military instructors
immediately. But the Moore County Sheriff's Department said they were not
told of the potentially dangerous encounter until the day after their
officer shot and killed Tomeny, 31.</TE>
<TE>   Army officials said that in the past, unplanned events, particularly
with law enforcement officials familiar with Robin Sage, were viewed as a
bonus to the realism of the exercise.</TE>
<TE>   But Army officials said unlike other local law enforcement agencies,
the Moore County Sheriff's Department had never participated in these
games. Lane Carter, chief deputy in the department, said his officers
were aware that troops trained in the area but had no idea the exercises
would involve soldiers wearing civilian clothes in civilian vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The Army moved immediately to prevent future misunderstandings,
ordering all Green Beret candidates to be in uniform throughout the
exercise and switching from phone and mail notification of local law
enforcement to face-to-face meetings.</TE>
<TE>   They also discontinued the long-standing use of training activities
that involved uniformed local law enforcement officials role-playing with
soldiers--a tactic that had been used as recently as last week.</TE>
<TE>   But the Army said it would not cancel or cut back the current Robin
Sage training exercise, which still has 199 prospective Green Berets out
in the field through Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "This exercise is unique within the Army not only in its setup and
organization but in the fact that it has been consistently validated by
operational success on the part of special operations soldiers around the
world," said Col. Charles A. King, commander of the 1st Special Warfare
Training Group.</TE>
<TE>   The training is conducted among civilians in parts of 10 central North
Carolina counties that make up nearly 4,500 square miles. King said there
was no way the exercises could be replicated within the borders of Ft.
Bragg. The move, he said, might eliminate confusion between role-playing
and reality but would also greatly limit the test of a soldier's ability
to react.</TE>
<TE>   Army officials said civilians have always been used to stage the Robin
Sage training. King noted that many of the 100 volunteers are second- and
even third-generation participants who are acting out of "patriotism" and
are not paid for their work.</TE>
<TE>   Civilians are critical to realistic training, Army officials say,
since dealing with nonmilitary people mimics the skills soldiers will
need in the field.</TE>
<TE>   King drew parallels between the work done during Robin Sage and work
that was done in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Pineland, he noted at Tuesday's news conference, is a land occupied by
an illegally installed government, backed by invaders from the north. The
war game goal of the U.S., as played out in training, is to liberate
Pineland from the oppressors.</TE>
<TE>   The special operations forces must meet up with guerrillas fighting
within Pineland to help train and supply their efforts. They must
navigate a world in which there are enemy troops abetted by law
enforcement officials. In addition, they face three types of civilians:
those working with them, those working against them and a majority who
are neutral.</TE>
<TE>   It is an elaborate, multilayered game designed to test the
adaptability of troops in the field, with only about 30% of soldiers who
enter Special Forces training reaching this final test.</TE>
<TE>   Tomeny and Phelps were 12 days into the exercise when the incident
took place. Their group, one of 15 detachments operating separately
throughout the whole of Pineland, already had infiltrated enemy ground,
made contact with guerrillas, set up a drop zone for supplies and located
and set up the rescue for a downed pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, King noted, was to have been a quiet day.</TE>
<TE>   The assignment seemed simple. The two men were sent on a
reconnaissance mission to scope out a railroad bridge east of Robbins. At
noon they left their base camp to meet up with Leiber, the civilian
driver.</TE>
<TE>   After checking out the bridge, the three men drove up and down Route
705 near the town of 1,200 to familiarize themselves with the area.</TE>
<TE>   It was there that Butler observed the truck, and occupants he did not
recognize, twice in the same area within an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Local law enforcement and Army officials agree what happened next was
a case of mistaken identity by both sides. As a result, safety measures
in place--which called for the soldiers to be passive when reality
intruded on the game--did not kick in.</TE>
<TE>   In the parking lot of a red-bricked and white-steepled church, Butler
approached the truck driven by Leiber, who lives about 20 minutes from
Robbins in an adjacent county. Butler told investigators he believed
Leiber was trying to hide something because he saw him with a bag and
then saw him try to shove the bag underneath his legs.</TE>
<TE>   Leiber told him they were trying to hire migrant workers. That rang
false to Butler because of the time of year.</TE>
<TE>   He then put Leiber in the back of his patrol car before returning to
talk to the Tomeny and Phelps. In the bag he had previously spotted,
Butler believed he saw two Army rifles--although military officials later
said it was one disassembled M-4 carbine with a muzzle to prevent live
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Tomeny approached Butler. The deputy sprayed him with pepper Mace.
Butler told investigators that he then asked the men to show him their
hands, but they did not. Phelps, he said, went for the bag as Tomeny
urged him to get a gun. At that point Butler began shooting.</TE>
<TE>   His frantic call for help once the two men were down was released
Monday and played by local television and radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   King said that while Moore County sheriff's officials were aware of
the training exercise, no one from the Army had notified them of the
Saturday reconnaissance mission in their jurisdiction "because there was
nothing to coordinate."</TE>
<TE>   The Robin Sage exercise, half a century old, is now conducted four
times a year. In August, shortly before the last Robin Sage, Army
officials asked local media to warn civilians that gunfire and strange
activity they might come across was really an "unconventional warfare
training scenario."</TE>
<TE>   "Safety is our No. 1 priority," the Army said then. It added that
"extensive planning" had been done with local officials to minimize
everyone's risk. This year the Army issued no such warning.</TE>
<TE>   Butler, who has been out on administrative leave with pay since
Saturday, was expected to come back to work today. Phelps, 27, was listed
in fair condition at a local hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents throughout the fictional "Pineland" say that over the
50 years the Army has been training here, they have grown accustomed to
gunfire and the fireworks of practice warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Others said they were shocked by the shooting. "I've lived here all my
life and I always knew the military trained in this area, but I didn't
know they did this kind of training," said Ann Moore, who works for the
town of Robbins as a zoning administrator.</TE>
<TE>   But in a region with a long and warm relationship with the military,
no one said the training should stop.</TE>
<TE>   Moore County's Carter asked for the final word at Tuesday's news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd just like to say that the Moore County Sheriff's Department is in
full support of our military training within the borders of Moore
County," he said. "And we will work with them closely in the future to
make sure a tragic event like this does not occur."</TE>

<HD>Bush Proposes 'Ethic of Work' in Welfare Plan</HD>
<DH>Aid: As part of a major policy review, the president seeks to
strengthen employment rules and spend millions to promote marriage as an
antidote to poverty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Tuesday proposed substantially
strengthening the work requirements for welfare recipients while
permitting poor people to meet them in part through training, drug
rehabilitation and other non-work activities.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the White House would spend $200 million on federal
efforts--and encourage $100 million more from the states--to promote
marriage, which many conservatives view as a potent antidote to poverty
and other social ills.</LD>
<LD>   Declaring that "our work is not done," Bush announced the
recommendations Tuesday as part of a White House effort to make required
work even more important in providing cash aid for the poor. The
six-year-old experiment in welfare reform will expire this year, and
Congress is beginning the first major review of welfare policy since the
mid-1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Administration officials on Tuesday described welfare reform as a
success, prompting nearly 3 million families to leave the rolls of public
aid--an extraordinary reduction that they attributed to new welfare
policies rather than to the booming economy of the 1990s. But they
emphasized that an array of new policies is needed to finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   "We ended welfare as we've known it, yet it is not a post-poverty
America," Bush told a group of neighborhood activists in a Washington
church. "Child poverty is still too high. Too many families are strained
and fragile and broken. Too many Americans still have not found work and
the purpose it brings."</TE>
<TE>   The president added: "At the heart of all these proposals is a single
commitment to return an ethic of work to an important place in all
American lives."</TE>
<TE>   The administration plan calls for 7 in 10 welfare recipients to hold
jobs by 2007, up from the current 3 in 10. And those recipients would be
required to work 40 hours a week, up from the current 30. During some of
these hours, workers could enroll in programs designed to aid their
long-term employment prospects.</TE>
<TE>   The White House proposals sparked applause from conservatives and
chagrin from liberals, who had not anticipated the tough new proposals
for work.</TE>
<TE>   "By increasing standards, we show a greater expectation for those we
are trying to help, and as we have seen, people will rise to our
expectations of them," said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), a champion of
the 1996 welfare overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) predicted that a major
welfare bill will pass the House this year.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday, the emerging debate had shaped up largely as a
reaffirmation of the 1996 welfare reform law, when Congress made
far-reaching decisions to end the lifetime entitlement to benefits, to
impose stricter work rules and to give states new control over their
welfare programs. The administration would continue welfare spending at
the current level of about $16.5 billion a year and preserve basic
features of the 1996 law.</TE>
<TE>   But Democratic critics and advocates for the poor took issue with
White House claims that it would broaden the freedom of states to design
their own programs. They urged Congress to index annual welfare spending
to inflation. And they called for restoring welfare benefits to
noncitizens, which were slashed in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "We all agree that work must be the central goal of welfare reform,"
said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.). But "I fear the plan just proposed
by the White House could actually reduce the states' discretion to
determine what mix of training, work and other activities" would most
help each welfare recipient.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also contended that the strict new work requirements would not
meet the needs of low-income families if the recession continues.
Advocates for the poor argue that welfare recipients must get more
marketable skills if they hope to climb beyond the bottom rungs of the
job ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "It [the White House plan] is couched in the rhetoric of increasing
access to education and training," said Deepak Bhargava, director of the
National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support, a coalition of
anti-poverty groups. "The reality is that it's a substantial retrenchment
from where we are now."</TE>
<TE>   The administration plan would eliminate a loophole that had let states
skirt work requirements for large numbers of welfare recipients as long
as overall caseloads were falling, which they did at spectacular rates in
the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Getting rid of that loophole would quickly force states to steer half
of their recipients into the work force. Then the administration would
require that the 50% go up to 70% by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the administration outlined ways that states could
soften the work requirements, substituting such activities as education,
training or drug rehabilitation--all of which might be essential for
someone to succeed in the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's proposal would permit states to place welfare
recipients in such full-time programs for three-month stints during any
24-month period. Also, it would allow beneficiaries to spend up to 16
hours per week in such activities, meaning that for many recipients the
workweek would be shorter than the required 40 hours. And it would
require welfare caseworkers to come up with "individualized plans" for
beneficiaries, aimed at helping them achieve "the maximum degree of
self-sufficiency."</TE>
<TE>   "Work is the pathway to independence and self-respect," Bush said
Tuesday. "Many are learning it is more rewarding to be a responsible
citizen than a welfare client; it is better to be a breadwinner respected
by your family."</TE>
<TE>   From local welfare offices to state capitals, officials reacted
guardedly to the White House proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very difficult," Bette Meyer, deputy county
administrator for health and human services in Cuyahoga County, Ohio,
said of the proposed mandate that 70% of beneficiaries be working. "It
may not be realistic."</TE>
<TE>   In Cleveland, she said, the number of families that receive welfare
has fallen from a 1990s peak of 27,000 to just 9,000 today, and about 35%
of the adults are in the work force. But getting a significantly larger
share of welfare recipients into jobs is not simple, Meyer said, noting
that such barriers as an ailing parent or child, the birth of a child, or
the recipient's own health problems often stand in the way.</TE>
<TE>   But Meyer was intrigued by White House provisions that would enable
welfare recipients to spend part of the week in programs that would
prepare them for the workplace. Half the adult recipients in Cleveland
lack high school degrees. "I think--if I understand it--it's in the right
direction," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Gov. John Engler of Michigan, chairman of the National
Governors Assn., called the Bush work requirements "pretty tough" and
said states should have more control over what counts as work in
calculating the percentage of people participating. "If you give us some
flexibility, some of us are ready to tackle it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond work rules, Bush administration officials hope a more
determined push to support stable families may yield future successes in
welfare reform. Bush on Tuesday saluted the "heroic work" of single
mothers but insisted that preserving two-parent families "should always
be our goal." To that end, the White House proposed that up to $300
million in public funds be used for experimental projects to learn what
sorts of strategies might enable the government to encourage stable
families.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also would create incentives for the states to return
more of their child support collections to families rather than hold on
to the money, a measure that might aid 280,000 families, according to
administration officials.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Villagers' Anguish Is Audible at Last</HD>
<DH>Asia: Talibs went after Shaidan with a vengeance, survivor says.
'We cried out, and no one heard us.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHAIDAN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>In this village that no longer exists, the dead outnumber the
living.</LD>
<LD>   A mound of gray earth beside the gutted village school covers 42
corpses. Across the road is a smaller grave with six corpses. Up a donkey
path, toward the silver-peaked Baba Mountains, villagers say they have
found more mass graves.</LD>
<LD>   All of the dead were Hazaras executed by the Taliban, said Abdul
Rahman Shaidani, head of the village shura, or council of elders. The
Taliban burned and sacked Shaidan not once but twice during the last
three years, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Across the soaring mountains and plunging gorges of central
Afghanistan, local residents said, the Taliban conducted a reign of
terror against the Hazara ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly five years, Hazara leaders said, the Taliban jailed,
tortured and executed thousands of Hazaras.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the Taliban routed from the region and Hazara survivors
slowly drifting back from their hide-outs in the mountains, the extent of
the persecution is becoming clear.</TE>
<TE>   Burned to the ground were villages such as Shaidan, where earlier this
month Shaidani escorted the first journalist to visit since before the
Taliban took power here in early 1997. Shaidan, a nine-hour donkey ride
over a heavily mined dirt track from the city of Bamian, the provincial
capital, was once home to several thousand people. Fewer than 20 families
remain, Shaidani said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who fled the killings hid in mud huts and caves in the
mountains, villagers said. Those who stayed were shot and dumped in mass
graves with their hands tied behind their backs with the cloth from their
own turbans, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban forces torched and looted every house in his village,
Shaidani said. They burned the school and the bazaar. They stole the
goats and horses and donkeys and the village's entire supply of wheat.
They desecrated the cemetery. They ripped the pumps from several wells.
They burned the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of Muslim burns a mosque?" Shaidani asked, standing in the
charred ruins of the home he had built into the red clay face of a cliff.
"These Taliban . . . were Muslims only in name."</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban members, who are Sunni Muslims, consider the Shiite
Hazaras kafir, or infidels. The Talibs who sacked Shaidan in 1999 and
again late last summer spray-painted insults to the Hazaras on their
homes. One message, spelled out with holes punched into soft adobe walls
with the round end of a shell casing, was a calling card: "Organization
of the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   Hazaras, descendants of Mongols, make up about 20% of Afghanistan's
population. Historically the enemies of the Pushtuns, who made up the
majority of the Taliban, they say they were targeted from Bamian province
north to Mazar-i-Sharif. There, Hazara residents this month said they had
found mass graves containing thousands of victims of a Taliban massacre
in 1998. That killing spree was said to be in retaliation for earlier
executions of Talibs by Hazaras.</TE>
<TE>   In the city of Bamian, where the Taliban destroyed two massive Buddha
statues last March, Western aid officials said they witnessed the
exhumation of half a dozen corpses in January. Near the Bamian airstrip
are three more pits where the Taliban dumped six, four and 12 corpses,
said Karim Khalili, the Hazara warlord whose guerrillas drove the Taliban
from the region in November with American military support. He said he
expected that more mass graves would be found when the snows melted.</TE>
<TE>   More than 3,000 Hazaras have been killed or have disappeared and 5,000
homes burned by the Taliban in Hazarajat, the Hazara homeland in Bamian
and neighboring provinces, Khalili said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very long main road in Yakaolang [district], and all along
this road, on both sides, every house has been burned. Every single
house," Khalili said at his adobe headquarters in a valley below the
crushed remains of the Buddhas. "There is not a single Hazara family that
has not lost someone to the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   When he returned in triumph to Bamian the second week of November,
Khalili said, he did not recognize his former capital. His office and
home had been plundered, and he had to stay in the tuberculosis ward of
the ransacked local hospital, prompting rumors that he was ill.</TE>
<TE>   In Shaidan, the destruction was even more systematic. The remote
village was once a thriving farming center, producing wheat, barley,
beans and cabbage. It is set in a broad valley ringed by red clay cliffs
that turn orange and yellow in the brilliant mountain sunshine. A grove
of trees once sheltered a community garden and park that are now an
expanse of crumpled adobe structures and gray dust.</TE>
<TE>   The only sound recently was the winter wind in the icy passes and the
steady drone of a U.S. warplane circling lazily overhead. The wind
carried the acrid scent of ash.</TE>
<TE>   In the ruins of a roofless house, two brothers in ragged clothes had
pinned a cardboard sign on the courtyard wall that read: "Hotel." Chaman
Ali, 18, and Mohammed Hassan, 16, sold tea and a place to rest to
survivors hiking to Bamian in hopes of securing food from aid
organizations based there. Their father had been killed by the Taliban,
the boys said, and they lived now with their mother in the family's
gutted home.</TE>
<TE>   For two miles along a dirt track that ran past the blackened shells of
homes and shops, the only human being in sight was Mohammed Eshaq, a
stooped figure trudging in the dust. Eshaq, 55, said he was heading for
Bamian. He had walked four hours from the village of Qarghanto, which he
said was as devastated and devoid of life as Shaidan. Taliban marauders
had reduced Qarghanto's population of several thousand to a handful of
hungry survivors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Eshaq said, he was held captive by the Taliban for 40 days
until his female relatives pleaded, successfully, for his release. He had
been tortured with electric shocks, he said, and six of the men who
shared his cell had been executed. His brother was seized from his home
one night and killed by Talibs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shaidani listened to the man's tale and shook his head. "So you see,"
he said. "Shaidan is not the only village to suffer."</TE>
<TE>   He waved his arms toward the mountains and recited the names of
several surrounding villages he described as having been burned and
pillaged: Sheberto, Achaqulha, Aq Rabat, Akhshai, Gulistan, Gunbad.</TE>
<TE>   But in Shaidan, he said, the Taliban was especially vindictive. Inside
a classroom at the plundered school, a Talib had left a spray-painted
taunt to survivors: "I am a Talib from Loghar. If you're a real man,
you'll come after me."</TE>
<TE>   Shaidani, 42, led the way to a tiny bathroom inside an adobe home
carved from a hillside. The floor was stained brown. It was the blood of
his friend, Ghulam Hussain, who he said was cornered in the room by
Talibs, who then slit his throat and watched his blood flow into the
gutter.</TE>
<TE>   Shaidani walked carefully from his friend's ruined home, staying to
the worn dirt path to avoid land mines left by the Taliban. He was
feeling empty and defeated, and he stood for a long time staring at the
spectral remains of his village.</TE>
<TE>   He moved at last to the rocky village graveyard. The headstones had
been smashed, including those that marked the graves of his parents. He
bent his head and prayed. His grandfather and great-grandfather were also
buried in this place.</TE>
<TE>   In his black leather jacket and tall fur hat, Shaidani cut a stark
profile against the barren landscape. He disappeared into the wreck of
his cliff-side house, which once had been a fine dwelling with airy rooms
and a spectacular view. It had been ransacked, rebuilt and ransacked
again. He lives now in Bamian in an adobe house his family shares with
eight other families from Shaidan.</TE>
<TE>   Shaidani said he had fled the village twice to escape the Taliban. On
one journey through the mountain snows, in 1999, his infant son and
daughter died of exposure, he said. His brother, who stayed behind, was
executed.</TE>
<TE>   It was all too much. Shaidani stood in his blackened doorway and wept.</TE>
<TE>   When he finished, he wiped his face with his head scarf. He had wept
in sorrow, he confessed, but also in joy and relief at the arrival of a
journalist in his wasted village.</TE>
<TE>   "During the whole time of the Taliban, we cried out to the world and
no one heard us," he said. "Now, finally, our story will be known."</TE>

<HD>Goodbye, Comfort; Hello, Service</HD>
<DH>Droves of educated Afghan exiles are returning to help rebuild
their homeland.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Omar Samad left behind an $80,000-a-year computer job in
Washington, charged $3,000 worth of air fare for his wife and himself,
and headed back to his homeland to help forge a new Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   As recently named spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, he has no idea
what his salary will be, when he'll get paid or if he'll be reimbursed
for the airline tickets. The pay for most senior government jobs is about
$50 a month.</LD>
<LD>   His childhood home is a pile of rubble, as is most of this
once-vibrant capital he fled two decades ago. Instead of the luxury
Northern Virginia high-rise condo the couple is paying off, Samad and his
wife make do with a borrowed bedroom.</LD>
<TE>   Samad, 40, who dedicated his time in the United States to bringing
Afghanistan's plight to the world's attention via a radio station he
founded and speeches across the country, is getting the chance to turn
his crusade from afar into reality from within.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do something I was good at and be effective," Samad said.</TE>
<TE>   In his feisty wife, Hassina Sherjan Samad, he has found a ready
compatriot for this odyssey. They met three years ago at a Hollywood
benefit for Afghans, where the two refugees got into an argument about
whether the event truly helped their nation's cause.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Samads, droves of educated Afghan exiles are giving up the
comfortable lives they built in the U.S. and Europe, and often leaving
their families behind, to help rebuild their homeland. Many plan to stay
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Foreign Minister Rahim Sherzoy, formerly of Stockton, now
resides at the Intercontinental. Kabul's best hotel is an oppressively
drab, hulking, Soviet-style building where some rooms sport bullet holes
and others bird nests. The closest thing to a shower comes when a bellboy
delivers a bucket of hot water in response to a shout down the hall.
Outside, soldiers sport Kalashnikov rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the constant cold and lack of central heat, the power
outages, the dusty air choked with diesel fumes and the curfew that
forces everyone off the streets at 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Phone calls to the U.S. cost at least $1 a minute and sometimes as
much as $3. Internet access is just as expensive. The only safe
commercial route into and out of the city is via a $600-each-way United
Nations charter flight to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, which seems
like paradise compared with Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife didn't want this," said Sherzoy, 68. She remained behind with
their children and grandchildren in Northern California, where they have
lived for 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "But I want to serve for the rest of my life here," said the former
career diplomat, who served as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and Pakistan
but retired when he fled to the U.S. "They [the Afghans] are poor and
needy."</TE>
<TE>   Raheen Makhdoom, 54, the interim government's information and culture
minister, returned in December, leaving his wife and two grown children
in Annandale, Va., where he had formed the nonprofit Assn. for Peace and
Democracy for Afghanistan. Makhdoom did not even wait to get a temporary
filling replaced after a root canal. He has nowhere to have the painful
tooth fixed now that the filling has fallen out.</TE>
<TE>   He asked his daughter to reduce her college course load and work more
to support the family. His wife, who is employed at a bank, is working
more as well.</TE>
<TE>One Returnee Wants a 'Meaningful' Life</TE>
<TE>   Makhdoom left Kabul a decade ago and had been active in the Afghan
resistance movement in Pakistan and the United States. This is his second
term as the information and culture minister. He held the post first in
1978, before being put under house arrest by the then-Communist
government for 14 months.</TE>
<TE>   Now his job is to help rebuild the country's arts, theater, national
museums and media, most of which were destroyed by the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "Life in the U.S. is comfortable and full of fun and happiness," he
said. "But for me, the life in Kabul is meaningful."</TE>
<TE>   There are others with similar stories. Central Bank Gov. Abdul Q.
Fitrat, 38, is another expatriate who returned, leaving behind his wife
and 19-month-old son in northern Virginia. Sharif Faez, 56, of Ashburn,
Va., gave up a translation business to become minister of higher
education.</TE>
<TE>   Some expatriates have come seeking to make a buck, start businesses or
work with humanitarian groups. For the most part, they've been warmly
received by Afghans who remained during more than two decades of war.
Some locals gripe privately, however, that exiles often are favored over
locals for civil service positions. For instance, some exiles will serve
on a panel that is outlining how the all-important loya jirga, or grand
council, will choose the next leader of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We lived through the Taliban and civil war," said one Afghan woman
who works for a humanitarian group. "We know best what has happened in
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   For all of his crusading from afar on behalf of Afghanistan, Samad
returned to Kabul somewhat of a stranger. Most of his family and friends
had followed him to the United States long ago. The ruins left by 23
years of warfare shocked and frustrated him. "The whole system has been
destroyed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not a single windowpane or desk remains at the elite French school he
attended. Its once state-of-the-art theater is now "open air"--thanks to
the huge bomb hole in the wall behind the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "The country, the city, are not the same," he said. "And the people
aren't the same either after two decades of fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Samad had spent some of his childhood living in London and Paris while
his father served as a diplomat. But when he returned to Afghanistan as a
teenager in 1978, it was to a reign of "red terror" that followed the
country's takeover by a leftist regime.</TE>
<TE>   Those who were educated, religious, Westernized--anyone deemed a
threat by the Communists--were targeted. The disappearance and presumed
death of his best friend changed him forever, Samad said, pushing him
"toward a commitment to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Samad's family, afraid that he would be drafted into the military,
arranged to get him out of the country when he was 17, just months before
Soviet forces moved in and began a 10-year occupation that killed about 1
million people and caused 6 million to flee the country.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually Samad arrived in Virginia to live with an uncle and was
joined several months later by the rest of his family. But he never
stopped thinking, talking, dreaming and campaigning about Afghanistan.
While attending community college in Virginia, where he studied computer
programming, he formed an Afghan students association to help refugees in
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>Previous U.S. Help Allegedly Misdirected</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few years, while he worked full time and earned a
bachelor's degree at night, he devoted his few free hours to the cause.
He lectured at colleges. He was happy to see the U.S. involved in helping
to rid his country of the Soviets during the 1980s but argued that the
aid was going to the wrong groups in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he did commentaries on Afghan issues for the major
U.S. television networks and wrote for a weekly publication aimed at
Afghan Americans. In 1996, he started an Afghan radio station in
Washington, and he later launched an affiliate in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But his attempts to bring what the Taliban was doing in Afghanistan to
the world's attention were mostly for naught, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was frustrating and nerve-racking to see the society implode and
then to see Taliban fanatics, extremists who have nothing to do with
Afghanistan and someone named Osama bin Laden take over my country in the
name of religion," Samad said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Afghan community was fractured, he said, "with educated
Afghan people in the West supporting the Taliban while sitting warmly in
London, Paris, Washington and San Francisco, not worrying that their
daughters can't go to school or that their wives were being lashed
because their ankle was showing."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood benefit where he met his future wife was put on by
female celebrities on behalf of Afghan women, with tickets going for
between $5,000 and $25,000. Hassina Samad thought at the time that the
benefit was a farce, "a Hollywood sham," as she called it. She was
especially upset when actresses talked about the importance of
mother-daughter relationships, when Afghanistan's problems went well
beyond that.</TE>
<TE>   She and Samad debated on the air for 90 minutes when he later
interviewed her for his show, saw each other once after that--she lived
in Walnut Creek, Calif., and he in Virginia--then married four months
later. Marriage "is always a gamble anyway," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hassina Samad thinks that the world has wrongly focused on the
controversy over the burka, the head-to-toe garment that many women in
Afghanistan wore in public even before the Taliban made it mandatory.
"They're ignoring the real problem: education," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her family fled Kabul about the same time as Samad and ultimately
ended up in Seattle. Her father, who had attended UCLA on a scholarship
as a young man and had been president of an Afghan textile company, could
find a job only as a furniture salesman.</TE>
<TE>   She worked as a beautician and later started a business making and
exporting children's clothes from Bali. But after her father's death
seven years ago, she began visiting Pakistan to help Afghan refugees,
forming a nonprofit organization to provide school supplies for children.
She was particularly struck when an Afghan woman with twin babies asked
which one to give away because she didn't have enough milk to feed both.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, Hassina is helping to provide money and supplies for a girls
school and other civic projects while keeping her hand in her clothing
business.</TE>
<TE>Inauguration Was Trial Return for Couple</TE>
<TE>   Before the Samads returned in December to do a radio show at the
inauguration of interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, there had been hints
that Omar might be drafted for the new administration. But nothing was
certain till he arrived. The couple also wanted to see if they really
wanted to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Samad, who is on unpaid leave from his job as an operations manager at
the Washington Transit Authority, attended a Tokyo conference on aid to
Afghanistan last month as spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   He worries about paying his debts and realizes that "everything, his
friends, family are in the U.S.," where both he and his wife are
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   But then, as he looks into the faces of Afghans and sees the agony
they suffer, he senses a glimmer of hope.</TE>
<TE>   "You realize that the country can't be rebuilt unless thousands of
Afghans return," Samad said. "There's nothing here for me but the desire
to be of service. So, for as long as I can, physically and mentally, I'll
stay."</TE>

<HD>Chilean Links Ozone Loss to Skin Ailments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PUNTA ARENAS, Chile
</DL>
<LD>Jaime Abarca works alone at the end of the world. He is the only
dermatologist in Patagonian Chile, a wind-swept landscape where trees
grow sideways and penguins frolic in icy waters.</LD>
<LD>   Those rare spring days when the sun blazes can bring fishermen into
Abarca's office with nasty burns on their cheeks. During one especially
bad spring, in 1999, Abarca treated six people with an ailment he'd never
seen in 15 years of practice: blistering sunburns.</LD>
<LD>   This month, Abarca and two Chilean climatologists published a paper in
an American academic journal that documents what they believe are the
first cases of skin ailments directly connected to the thinning of the
ozone layer. The sun blisters Abarca treated in 1999, it turns out,
coincided with days when the ozone hole over the Antarctic had grown
large enough to float over Punta Arenas.</LD>
<TE>   "The problem is eight or nine days every spring, when there is a sharp
change in the weather," Abarca said in his office at the regional
hospital in this city of 123,000.</TE>
<TE>   On most days, even sunny ones, residents of Punta Arenas and nearby
Tierra del Fuego--the southernmost inhabited regions in the world--tend
to cover themselves against the fiercely cold winds. The average summer
temperature in Punta Arenas is just 51 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   But when the winds die down and the clouds disappear, people start to
shed their sweaters and hats. They might forget about the danger of
getting burned by ultraviolet rays, despite a public notice system that
warns people on days when the ozone is thinner than usual.</TE>
<TE>   Abarca published his paper in the Journal of the American Academy of
Dermatology with co-authors Claudio Casiccia and Felix Zamorano,
climatologists at the University of Magallanes.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, most studies on ozone layer thinning and its effect on
humans have centered on statistical analyses of the increase in skin
cancer rates in the middle latitudes, Abarca said.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by Chilean dermatologist Juan Honeyman found a 28%
increase in conditions such as cheilitis--fissures around the mouth--over
a seven-year period in the Punta Arenas region.</TE>
<TE>   But no studies have provided specific evidence linking such increases
to changes in the ozone layer.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of sun-related ailments in animals and humans in southern Chile
prompted a team of investigators, funded in part by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, to travel to Punta Arenas in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   A joint American-Chilean study published in 1995 found no basis for
the rumors, which included stories of sheep and cattle being blinded,
presumably by long-term exposure to high levels of ultraviolet radiation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the study found that UV radiation in southern Chile increased
as much as 2.3 times on some days, because of the shifting of the ozone
hole, overall sun exposure increased only 1% a year. People in Punta
Arenas are still exposed to less UV light than residents of Washington,
D.C., even with the thinning ozone layer.</TE>
<TE>   Abarca's work shows a much more subtle and passing effect, tied as
much to the fickle Patagonian weather and recreational habits of the
residents as to the ozone layer.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1999 outbreak, the two spring days with the largest ozone
loss happened to come on Sundays; one was on the same day the city staged
a four-hour car race. And both those Sundays had relatively little cloud
cover. On the Sunday with the worst ozone loss--Dec. 5, the end of the
Chilean spring--Abarca treated more sunburns in a single day--eight--than
he had ever treated in a single year.</TE>
<TE>   Abarca's findings confirm what local doctors have said for years.</TE>
<TE>   "People burn because they live in a culture where the sunburn has
never been an everyday concern," said Jorge Barrientos, a pediatrician.
"What keeps it from being an even more serious problem is that people
spend so much time indoors."</TE>

<HD>In Israel, a Holiday Spells Anxiety</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Traditionally, Purim is the delight of kids and grown-ups
alike. But this year, bad memories and unrest have many on edge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>It is supposed to be the most festive holiday on the Jewish
calendar. Children dress up as princesses and Spiderman and in an array
of sparkling costumes. They play pranks and set off firecrackers.
Thousands of Israelis watch floats parading through their towns.</LD>
<LD>   But Purim also brings horrific memories of a string of suicide
bombings in 1996 and 1997 that killed dozens of Israelis. Now, with the
country mired in the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian fighting in decades,
Israelis are marking the date with more apprehension than joy.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of the typical open-air carnivals and masquerade balls, many
Israeli families have sought out safer indoor venues, avoided crowds or
decided to forgo parties altogether.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm afraid. The situation is terrible, and no place is safe," said
Rachel Ohayon, a resident of the coastal city of Netanya who took her
children to a kind of Purim play day at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
"But I don't want to stop the kids from having their holiday. It's very
special for them."</TE>
<TE>   Ohayon was supervising two daughters, 7 and 4, dressed as beauty
queens, and her 2-year-old son, who looked like a pint-size Batman. They
and other children were attending workshops in the museum's Youth Wing,
pasting together finger puppets and painting masks.</TE>
<TE>   Although overall attendance has plummeted since the start of the
current conflict 17 months ago, the museum's sprawling complex on
Jerusalem's tree-dotted western slope has become an especially popular
destination for families, a kind of safe bubble, in the words of Youth
Wing curator Nurit Shilo-Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   With warnings of terrorist attacks already high, thousands of regular
and paramilitary police officers were deployed throughout the country for
the holiday, which marks the rescue from slaughter of Persia's Jews about
2,500 years ago. It was observed Tuesday in most of the Jewish world and
is being observed today in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   In the port city of Haifa, police arrested a Palestinian who they said
was carrying a loaded AK-47 assault rifle and two spare clips and was on
his way to use them. And in Jerusalem, a policewoman died of wounds
inflicted Monday when a Palestinian gunman strafed a crowded bus stop.</TE>
<TE>   At a factory on Jerusalem's northern outskirts this morning, a
Palestinian shot an Israeli to death, police said. A Palestinian was
wounded in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Purim lost its lighthearted luster years ago. Suicide bombings killed
13 Israelis crowding Tel Aviv's largest shopping mall during the Purim of
1996, and four more a year later at a cafe. The victims included
youngsters in their Purim costumes. Dozens more people were killed in a
pair of bus bombings leading up to the 1996 Purim attack.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, the Palestinians launched a new uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which has escalated
to include near-daily suicide bombings, shootings or other attacks on
Israelis, while Israel has retaliated with aerial bombardments, the
targeted killings of Palestinian militants and a harsh siege on most
Palestinian towns and cities.</TE>
<TE>   Call it resilience, call it denial--Israelis have a knack for
adjusting many aspects of their daily lives to a relentless violence and
the threat of more. Nearly 300 Israelis have been killed since September
2000--the Palestinian death toll is almost three times that--and there is
no end in sight. Some people take all sorts of measures to keep safe, and
others seek routine as their own form of defiance.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to a basic belief," said Nadav Wertsman, who works for
a high-tech company. "I have no intention of leaving this place. We are
here, and no one will break us. It may sound old-fashioned, but it's
true."</TE>
<TE>   Wertsman was also at the museum. He wore a pair of shaggy dog ears,
and his 4-year-old daughter was decked out in a princess' white gown and
a faux diamond tiara.</TE>
<TE>   Another parent, her two boys in tow, said she has grown accustomed to
the fear around Purim. "This year is worse, but every year there are
warnings and people are afraid to go places," said Shirley, a translator
for film subtitles who asked that her last name not be published.</TE>
<TE>   She said she is horrified to hear her sons, 3 and 7, talk about
"fighting the Arabs"--mimicking, no doubt, what they see on television or
hear on the playground. "I can see the conflict already went down to the
next generation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Lenk, a graphic designer who lives in the Jerusalem suburb of
Mevaseret Zion, also hoped to find a respite at the museum. As they left
home, her 8-year-old had paused. "I hope today it's only for
celebrations," Margalit, donning a red-and-white jester's cap, told her
mother. "I hope nothing bad happens."</TE>
<TE>   Orit Arfa, who moved here from Los Angeles two years ago and works at
the museum, said that although she avoids going into the center of the
city and stays at home as much as she can, she planned to dance the night
away at one of Jerusalem's hot nightclubs, many of which were determined
to go ahead with Purim parties. "As long as I know they are taking major
security precautions, I'm OK," said Arfa, 25.</TE>
<TE>   In towns such as Ranana and Kfar Sava, the site of several deadly
attacks, officials canceled the Purim parade and most public festivities,
citing the security risk. But in others, where parades were called off
last year, officials decided to restore the full slate of events as a way
to show resolve and a refusal to be cowed by terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In one such city, Holon, thousands turned out for Tuesday's parade. In
the northern city of Hadera, public celebrations were being held at a
banquet hall where a Palestinian gunman killed six guests last month at a
bat mitzvah.</TE>
<TE>   "Purim is about pretense," the Jerusalem Post noted last week.
"Pretending to be something you're not. In more innocent days, Jews would
dress up as Arabs. Men as women. Children as soldiers. This year,
Israelis are donning a new mask: one of bravado."</TE>
<TE>   Purim commemorates events in 5th century BC Persia. King Ahasuerus'
evil advisor, Haman, convinced him that Jews were bad people who refused
to obey the law and should be annihilated. Ahasuerus ordered the massacre
of the kingdom's Jews until his new wife, the beautiful Esther--a
Jew--outwitted Haman and persuaded the king to change his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Some Israelis didn't miss the chance to liken today's chaos to the
Purim story.</TE>
<TE>   "The Haman of the 21st century is in Ramallah," Cabinet Minister Natan
Sharansky told Israeli state radio, alluding to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. "If not for political constraints, we should
have treated him the way Haman was treated."</TE>
<TE>   Haman was hanged.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Peace Plan Defuses Policy Clash</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinians shelve proposed U.N. resolution in support of
Riyadh's pledge to recognize Israel if it cedes Gaza and the West Bank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>A tentative Saudi peace initiative helped avert a showdown over
Mideast policy here Tuesday, as Security Council members lined up to
praise a recent pledge by the kingdom to recognize Israel in exchange for
its withdrawal from formerly Arab lands.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian diplomats, who have enthusiastically embraced Saudi
Arabia's nascent proposal, agreed to withdraw a proposed Security Council
resolution on the conflict that the U.S. had planned to veto. In a
lengthy, often heated open debate about Middle East policy, Security
Council members voiced alarm at the continuing violence in the region,
with most strongly criticizing Israel's attacks on Palestinian security
installations and its continued travel restrictions on Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   But the tenor of the discussion was notably altered by the recent
Saudi assurances that Israel can expect peaceful relations with its Arab
neighbors if it accepts the establishment of a Palestinian state on
territory occupied by Israel after the 1967 Middle East War, including
most of East Jerusalem. A number of Arab states have cautiously backed
the proposal.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal has not yet been fully and officially articulated by
Saudi leaders, and some Israeli diplomats have complained that it does
not mark a major change in long-standing Arab policy. But the initiative
has been welcomed by President Bush, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and even Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat told recent visitors to his besieged West Bank compound that he
had "encouraged and approved" the Saudi initiative, which was first
floated in a pair of New York Times op-ed articles this month.</TE>
<TE>   In what could be a sign of either hope or desperation, almost every
other speaker in the debate Tuesday evening here took pains to salute
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, the desert kingdom's de facto ruler, for
trying to revive the moribund peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Before the debate began, the Palestinians agreed to table a draft
resolution that, if passed, would have put the Security Council on record
for the first time as favoring an "independent, democratic and viable
state of Palestine living side by side with the state of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   The text circulated by the Palestinians before the debate deliberately
echoed the Saudi formula, calling for both Israel's "withdrawal from the
territories it occupied in June 1967, and for establishing normal
relations among all states of the region based on mutual recognition and
respect."</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis--as well as the State Department and a few European
foreign ministries--believe that the terms of withdrawal should be left
up to negotiators. The resolution, which may yet be revived, also calls
for mediation by "the wider international community"--in other words, not
the U.S. alone, which further raises American and Israeli hackles.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had instructed U.S. diplomats here to veto the
proposed resolution--or any other resolution to which Israel would
strongly object, U.S. officials said. "As a practical matter, Security
Council action at this time will not resolve the problems between
Palestinians and Israelis," John D. Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, told the council Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S., European and Israeli diplomats noted privately that the
Palestinian draft resolution had unexpectedly omitted proposals Israel
had strongly objected to previously, including requests for international
monitoring teams or peacekeepers. The more conciliatory Palestinian
approach was widely attributed to growing Arab support for the Saudi
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Negroponte noted that Bush spoke with Abdullah on Tuesday morning "and
praised the crown prince's ideas regarding full Arab-Israeli
normalization once a comprehensive peace agreement can be achieved."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the proposal
"underscores Saudi Arabia's willingness to reach out to Israel, and that,
the president finds, is encouraging." Still, Bush does not believe that
the proposal is a "major breakthrough," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who last week described the Saudi
initiative as a "minor development" in the region, said Monday that the
idea was an "important step."</TE>
<TE>   Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said after
meeting with Sharon in Jerusalem on Tuesday that the prime minister said
he "would like to know more about the content and he would be ready to
meet anybody from Saudi Arabia--formally, informally, publicly,
discreetly, whatever--to get better information about this initiative."</TE>
<TE>   Solana headed for Saudi Arabia to discuss the proposal directly with
Abdullah today.</TE>
<TE>   The subtle but significant Saudi policy shift was first signaled in a
Feb. 17 New York Times column by Thomas Friedman, who wrote that Abdullah
had told him that he had considered delivering a speech to the Arab
League in March pledging to recognize Israel if it would pull out of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   At first, diplomats paid little heed to Abdullah's conversation with
the American columnist. After all, Sharon has stood foursquare against
full withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank and especially from East
Jerusalem. The crown prince appeared to some to be simply restating the
Saudis' long-held position that Israel should abide by Security Council
Resolution 242, which in the Arab interpretation requires an Israeli
withdrawal from the lands it occupied after the 1967 war.</TE>
<TE>   "No government . . . would act on so narrow a formula," said Henry
Siegman, a Middle East expert at the Council of Foreign Relations.</TE>
<TE>   Siegman said he phoned a senior aide to Abdullah the day Friedman's
column was published to see whether the Saudis were prepared to go
further.</TE>
<TE>   "I discovered that there is greater flexibility," he said Tuesday. As
Siegman reported in a subsequent op-ed article--written, he said, at the
Saudis' explicit urging, and submitted only after Abdullah reviewed the
text--the Saudi government is now prepared to recognize Israeli
sovereignty over Jewish areas of East Jerusalem, including, crucially,
the Western Wall and the rest of the historic Jewish Quarter of
Jerusalem's Old City.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials then confirmed the outlines of this more nuanced
position in their state-controlled press and in discussions with Powell
and other foreign leaders. Adel al-Jubeir, a senior advisor to Abdullah,
said Tuesday on CNN that the Saudi proposal is in its essence "very
simple: Withdraw from the territories, including Jerusalem, in exchange
for normalization."</TE>

<LD>Flames from a small stove started the fire that killed 363 people
in Egypt's worst train disaster, investigators have concluded.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators found several small stoves amid the charred debris of
the two train cars that suffered the worst damage in the Feb. 20 fire
south of Cairo, according to several Egyptian newspapers. Passengers
often carry such equipment to heat food and water for tea and coffee,
despite regulations banning stoves, gas cylinders and fuel.</LD>

<DH>Environment: A Cold War mining company is working to undo the
damage it caused. Towns hope the effort will restore farming, tourism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RONNEBURG, Germany
</DL>
<LD>Eighteen hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year
except Christmas, a deafening concert of grinding gears and groaning
engines serenades neighbors of Germany's most daunting post-Communist
cleanup.</LD>
<LD>   The $7-billion project is aimed at reclaiming the rural landscape
across an 80-mile swath of Thuringia and Saxony states from the wreckage
of Wismut, a Soviet-run mining colossus that made East Germany the
world's third-largest uranium producer and a vital supplier for Moscow
during the arms race.</LD>
<LD>   When the Communist world began to come apart a dozen years ago, the
Eastern Bloc market for uranium fell with it. No longer able to sell its
massive output, Wismut was transformed from the biggest employer in the
region into a slow-motion disappearing act. It is now tasked by the
German government with taking itself out of business and restoring the
environment to its bucolic, pre-Cold War condition.</LD>
<TE>   Easier said than done. The effort, which has run for 11 years and is
expected to take at least another decade, literally involves moving
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Four conical piles of radioactive tailings, too symmetrical and
jarring on the flat terrain to be mistaken for natural peaks, tower over
Ronneburg and its remaining 6,000 residents. The man-made hills,
discarded residue from more than four decades of hell-bent excavation,
testify to the feverish quest that consumed this region during the
Communist era to help build atomic weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The slag heaps came out of the most striking environmental affliction
left by Wismut, the open-pit mine here that is the largest ever gouged
into Europe, according to its creators. In a reversal of the life's work
of the company, reclamation specialists are relocating the voluminous
tailings, putting all 58 million cubic yards back where they belong, one
truckload at a time. Once the relocation is finished, sometime in 2007,
the mine--which now yawns more than 2 miles in diameter--will be capped
with clay and a layer of soil to return the landscape to grass and
forests.</TE>
<TE>   Ronneburg is just one of dozens of towns and villages here in
Thuringia and in Saxony blighted by Wismut, which at its post-World War
II peak enslaved 130,000 Germans in a war-reparations program founded and
run by the Soviet military. After Wismut's restructuring in 1954 into a
joint Soviet-East German company with wage-earning employees, the highly
secret operations ran roughshod over the surrounding environment for
nearly four decades more, poisoning ground water, piling up radioactive
waste and perforating the land with 875 miles of shafts and tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Wismut's properties are so honeycombed with subterranean
passages that entire neighborhoods have been swallowed by cave-ins. Other
sites have been inundated by avalanches from the ubiquitous tailings.</TE>
<TE>   "What I still find astounding is how all this activity went on right
in the middle of populated areas," Peter Wagner, in charge of the massive
slag relocation project, said as he surveyed the cleanup work in Bad
Schlema, a once and future spa town in Saxony.</TE>
<TE>   From a natural promontory in the foothills of the Ore Mountains
overlooking Bad Schlema, Wagner pointed out the former site of a luxury
hotel renowned in the 1930s for providing radium bath treatments to those
suffering from rheumatism. The sprawling hotel was razed in the 1960s
after mining came too close and damaged its foundation.</TE>
<TE>   A fleet of earthmoving equipment second only to that at Ronneburg is
at work grading Bad Schlema's artificial ridges into smoother terrain,
which will be laced with hiking paths and other recreational facilities,
including fairgrounds and a golf course for the spa guests already
returning to the town for "cures."</TE>
<TE>   Even below the surface, Wismut is at work undoing its past. More than
200 veteran miners are filling in passages that still threaten to cause
cave-ins on the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Measurements throughout the Wismut sites have established that about
15% of the company's territory is contaminated with radiation and in need
of cleanup, said Wismut's information officer, Werner Runge.</TE>
<TE>   Dilapidated housing blocks thrown up en masse to shelter thousands of
workers remind visitors that these veritable ghost towns were once
thriving industrial hubs. Constructed of cheap, prefabricated panels and
never well maintained, most of the buildings are slated for demolition.</TE>
<TE>   One of the idle ore-processing sites has been transformed into an
industrial park, with a furniture maker and a trucking company taking
advantage of the property abutting the main Frankfurt-Dresden highway.
But most of the sites are monuments to the region's economic depression:
abandoned buildings, empty parking lots, and weeds sprouting through the
approach roads and sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   As is the case in much of the region that was dependent on Wismut, the
populations of Ronneburg and Bad Schlema have been halved over the last
decade as workers moved in search of new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Official figures show the region to have 20% unemployment, but Wismut
Director Christoph Rudolph says the situation is more dire, because many
redundant miners and processing workers are dependent on
government-financed retraining and make-work programs.</TE>
<TE>   As bleak as the job picture is, Bad Schlema Mayor Konrad Barth says it
will have to get worse before it can get better. He wants one of the few
surviving enterprises--a nearly bankrupt paper mill not owned by
Wismut--shut down.</TE>
<TE>   "Our only hope is to return to the region's traditional role as a
health spa, and a paper mill is inconsistent with that aim," Barth said.</TE>
<TE>   Restoring Bad Schlema's reputation as a place to take the waters is
among the objectives of the huge government-run cleanup and has provided
one of the few new activities in the region to be turning a profit. A new
therapeutic aquatic center treats an average of 1,300 outpatients a day,
providing about 100 new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Wismut remained highly secretive and environmentally disastrous for
decades, but the brutal disregard for worker safety that took hundreds of
lives during Soviet military oversight was gradually reformed, said
Rudolph.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, after German reunification and the realization that Wismut
was no longer economically viable, the Soviet Union ceded its 50%
interest in the mine to the German government, which in turn drafted the
decommissioning project.</TE>
<TE>   Envisioned in the reclamation plan is an eventual return to the
traditional pursuits of those in the region: farming in the Thuringia
lowlands and tourism in the once-scenic Ore Mountains region in Saxony.</TE>
<TE>   But investors have been slow to warm to the towns despoiled by Wismut,
despite what Runge, the information officer, says are repeated scientific
surveys attesting that there is little, if any, health threat from the
residual and unprocessed tailings.</TE>
<TE>   One problem remains: the nearly round-the-clock noise of the cleanup.
So many roaring 100-ton trucks are deployed on the filling and grading
that traffic controllers are needed at each site to prevent collisions.</TE>
<TE>   Wismut, down to 3,000 employees from the 43,000 at the time of
reunification, eventually will go out of existence.</TE>
<TE>   "There will never really be an end to the work, as there will always
be maintenance needed at the reclaimed sites," Runge said. "But we don't
expect to survive as a company. By the end of the current contract [in
2010], this giant known as Wismut will have disappeared."</TE>

<HD>China to Press U.S. on Arms Control Pact</HD>

<LD>China will send its top arms control official to Washington in
March in an effort to break a deadlock in nonproliferation talks, a
senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Securing a deal that would hold China to its November 2000 pledge not
to export missile technology to countries including North Korea and Iran
was a key objective that eluded President Bush during his visit to
Beijing last week.</LD>
<LD>   The official, speaking to foreign reporters on the condition of
anonymity, said China was firmly committed to nonproliferation, and he
urged the U.S. to meet the Beijing government halfway.</LD>
<TE>   "We think the ball is in your court," he said. "We have made our
efforts, and we would expect you would act in the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Although Beijing has not directly spelled out a quid pro quo that
would lead to a deal, it has clearly signaled what it hopes Washington
will do: curb arms sales to Taiwan, which China sees as a separatist
province; lift sanctions against Chinese companies accused of weapons
technology sales; and end restrictions on Chinese rocket launches of U.S.
commercial satellites.</TE>
<TE>   The trip by chief arms control negotiator Liu Jieyi will mark the
third time in recent months that a top Chinese diplomat has traveled to
Washington to press for an arms control agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Nonproliferation talks are stalled over U.S. insistence that Beijing's
pledge applies to contracts signed before November 2000, and disagreement
over the list of technologies whose export China should ban.</TE>
<TE>   The Foreign Ministry official pledged that China "would publish the
list in due course." He reiterated Beijing's contention that some Chinese
firms exported weapons technology without the government's knowledge or
consent.</TE>
<TE>   "If entities are discovered to have violated regulations and policies,
they will be punished, and it won't happen again," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that Beijing would conduct other official exchanges in a
bid to maintain the positive momentum in U.S.-China relations following
Bush's visit.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao's first visit to the U.S., announced
last week, has been set for April, the official said. Hu is expected to
replace President Jiang Zemin next year.</TE>
<TE>   The official also confirmed that China has agreed to let the FBI
station an agent in Beijing to coordinate anti-terrorism and law
enforcement cooperation, while Beijing is considering sending one of its
law enforcement officials to the U.S. for a similar purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The Foreign Ministry official indicated that although the regime put
up with Bush's lectures about U.S. values during his trip, it was less
accepting of his stance toward Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Bush repeatedly dodged Chinese questions about why he
emphasized the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue--and not
necessarily reunification, which Beijing seeks with the island.</TE>
<TE>   "A 'one-China' policy implies reunification," the official insisted.</TE>
<TE>   He added that Washington's policy toward Taiwan was inconsistent with
its goal of maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait.</TE>
<TE>   "By selling weapons and increasing contacts of an official nature,
including military contacts," he said, the U.S. is "sending the wrong
signal to Taiwan."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks Hand-Over of Key Pearl Suspect</HD>
<DH>Asia: Ambassador presses Pakistan's president to release the
alleged mastermind in the abduction and slaying of the reporter.</DH>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>U.S. Ambassador Wendy Chamberlin appealed to President Pervez
Musharraf on Tuesday to hand over the chief suspect in the killing of
Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   It was not immediately clear how Musharraf responded. Spokesmen for
the Pakistani leader and the U.S. Embassy declined to provide details
about the meeting. "She brought it up," embassy spokesman Mark Wentworth
said. "I don't have any details."</LD>
<LD>   The subject is a sensitive one for Pakistan, at least in part because
officials fear that turning over the alleged mastermind of the slaying,
Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, could set a precedent for India to demand the
extradition of 20 suspected terrorists from Pakistan.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. and Pakistan have no extradition treaty. Pakistan has
indicated that it wants to keep Sheikh in the country to help
investigators recover Pearl's body and the weapons used to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani media reports said prosecutors here would seek the death
penalty against Sheikh, which would mean he would be hanged. Court cases
in Pakistan are tried with a single judge, without a jury, and can be
appealed to a higher court as well as the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   If Sheikh is handed over to the U.S., it would probably happen after
March 12, when the investigation is closer to completion, foreign
diplomatic sources have said. On Monday, a Pakistani judge gave
prosecutors two more weeks to build their case against Sheikh, a
British-born Muslim militant, and two alleged accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 in Karachi while working on a story about
Islamic radicals in Pakistan. A videotape showing his slaying surfaced
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's slaying isn't the only crime Sheikh is wanted for in the
United States. A federal grand jury indicted him in the 1994 kidnapping
in India of four Western tourists, including an American.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Monday that a 1931
extradition treaty between the United States and Britain's colonial
administration in South Asia--which included the region that became India
and Pakistan in 1947--should apply.</TE>
<TE>   "Even without this . . . it does not change the United States'
fundamental determination to bring justice" to Pearl's killers, Fleischer
said.</TE>
<TE>   After speaking with Chamberlin, Musharraf called Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell to discuss the hand-over request, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pakistanis are examining our request, and we'll continue these
discussions to make sure the common desire on both sides to see that
justice is served is in fact brought to fruition," Boucher said.</TE>

<HD>ABC's 'Exclusive' With Pearl's Widow Disputed</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>CBS and NBC's news divisions accused ABC's "Good Morning America"
of unseemly behavior Tuesday over the program's handling of the first TV
interviews with Mariane Pearl following confirmation of the killing of
her husband, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   The Journal arranged for Mariane Pearl to speak to CNN and the BBC
with the understanding that the interviews would air on those outlets
first because both are seen in Pakistan. After that, the footage was to
be made available to any network in the world that wanted it.</LD>
<LD>   But "Good Morning America" aired the BBC interview immediately,
labeling it "exclusive." CNN labeled its own interview, running at the
same time, "exclusive" before distributing it to other networks.</LD>
<TE>   "The first interview with Danny Pearl's wife wasn't theirs, and it
wasn't an exclusive," said Steve Friedman, executive producer of CBS'
"The Early Show," regarding ABC. "They are perpetrating a fraud on the
audience."</TE>
<TE>   NBC officials declined to comment, but staffers there said they also
thought ABC had acted inappropriately.</TE>
<TE>   "Good Morning America" defended its actions, citing a long-standing
relationship with the BBC that enabled ABC to record the feed in London
as it came in to the BBC and immediately feed it to New York.</TE>
<TE>   As for the CNN interview, ABC still opted to use the "exclusive"
banner "because we were the only American morning broadcast to have the
BBC interview at 7 a.m.," the show's spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   A BBC spokesman characterized the incident as a "misunderstanding,"
and Journal spokesman Steve Goldstein said the paper did not intend for
ABC to have a jump on running the interview. He said the BBC assured him
it was an inadvertent error.</TE>
<TE>   In the BBC interview, Pearl, who is seven months pregnant with the
couple's first child, urged the world to unite to fight terrorism and
said she would tell her unborn son that his father died a hero.</TE>
<TE>   "His spirit, his faith and his convictions have not been defeated,"
she said. "And I am extremely proud of him."</TE>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon has begun providing combat helicopters to the former
Soviet republic of Georgia and will soon begin training several Georgian
battalions to counter what defense officials believe is a growing
terrorist threat in the country's mountainous Pankisi Gorge region,
senior U.S. officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The move to train and equip the Georgian military opens a new front in
the Bush administration's war on terrorism and is fueled by a belief
shared by the United States and Georgia that Al Qaeda members and other
Islamic extremists from the Russian republic of Chechnya have taken
refuge in northern Georgia along the Chechen border.</LD>
<LD>   The mission also represents an acknowledgment by the administration
that Arab fighters connected to the Al Qaeda terrorist network have
joined Chechen forces to battle the Russian army, an assertion long made
by Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a clear connection between Chechens and Al Qaeda. They
clearly fall under the potential targets of the global war on terrorism,"
said one defense official.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 U.S. military personnel, including Special Forces, visited
Georgia this month to assess Georgia's security needs, according to Lt.
Col. Ed Loomis, a spokesman for the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart,
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has already provided Georgia with 10 UH-1H Huey
helicopters, six for operations and four for spare parts, Loomis said. A
U.S. military trainer and six contractors are in Tblisi, the Georgian
capital, helping Georgian personnel learn to operate the aircraft.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Closes Besieged Strategy Office</HD>
<DH>Defense: The agency stirred misinformation claims. Attempts to
mislead the enemy in wartime will continue, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon's flirtation with a high-level office to influence
public sentiment abroad came to an abrupt end Tuesday, when the fledgling
effort was ingloriously disbanded in response to pressure from the White
House and dissension within the Defense Department.</LD>
<LD>   But with or without an Office of Strategic Influence, the Pentagon
intends to continue its long-standing practice of dispensing misleading
information to enemies in wartime, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   That means telling the truth to reporters--but not necessarily the
whole truth--conducting and publicizing military exercises with the
express purpose of misleading foes about future military operations and
keeping the details of new weapon systems under wraps. All have been
routine practice at the Pentagon for generations.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to preserve our option to mislead the enemy about our
operations," said Douglas Feith, the undersecretary for policy who
oversaw the office.</TE>
<TE>   What the Pentagon will not and never intended to do, Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld said this week, is to consciously plant false stories
about its operations in the press.</TE>
<TE>   Established in November, the Office of Strategic Influence was
described as an effort to consolidate under one command various functions
such as psychological and information warfare that until now had been
spread through the Department of Defense. It grew out of the Pentagon's
frustration over early backlash in the Islamic media against the U.S.-led
war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But the operation came under fire last week when the New York Times
said the office, headed by Air Force Brig. Gen. Simon P. Worden, had
proposed spreading false information to foreign journalists as a means of
furthering the U.S. war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld and others responded that the Pentagon would never lie. The
Pentagon's public affairs office, which coordinates news media coverage
of the military and works with journalists daily, expressed its
reservations publicly, with officials telling reporters they feared the
new operation would undermine their credibility. Inside the Pentagon,
pressure became intense to dismantle the office.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say anything more than that the biggest disinformation
campaign was leveled at us," said Lt. Col. Marty France, a spokesman for
the office.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to "make sure that all our efforts among all the agencies
are better coordinated, not conflicting or stepping on each other's
feet," France said. "We're interested in getting the facts out to foreign
audiences that are prevented from receiving them."</TE>
<TE>   When the controversy broke, Rumsfeld professed to know little about
its mandate. But on Tuesday, in disclosing that the office would be shut
down, he said criticism of the office had been "off the mark" and had
made it impossible for the agency to do its job. He appeared to blame the
press.</TE>
<TE>   "The office is done. What do you want, blood?" Rumsfeld asked
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The military has several agencies charged with conducting various
types of information warfare. Most are kept under wraps, but one, the
Army's 4th Psychological Operations group at Ft. Bragg, N.C., has been
widely publicized recently for the leafletting campaigns and radio
broadcasts it has conducted in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Much of information warfare consists of what the Pentagon calls
"white," or factual news releases and interviews based strictly on the
truth. But military special operations teams have in the past also
conducted "gray" operations, in which the public is misled, and "black"
operations that include disinformation.</TE>
<TE>   The disinformation operations, highly secret, are often conducted by
intelligence agencies, sometimes with support from the Pentagon, current
and former defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the buildup to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the military went to
elaborate lengths to let it be known that it was conducting amphibious
assault exercises off the coast of Kuwait. It was all part of a
psychological warfare operation aimed at deceiving Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein into believing that the U.S. would attack to the north.</TE>
<TE>   "We put out every indication to the press and therefore to the Iraqis
that we were going to do an amphibious landing in Kuwait," said Jay
Farrar, who handled press and congressional relations for the joint
chiefs of staff at the time. "We gave the Iraqis the distinct impression
that we were going to put this big assault up through Kuwait City."</TE>
<TE>   But because the military exercises were real, the Pentagon says it was
not lying about them, just encouraging the press to cover them instead of
something else.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a conscious decision to let the press cover it. That doesn't
mean it's a lie," Farrar said. "We were practicing it. We were getting
the troops ready. The troops were fully expecting to go. But it served a
purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The military did the same thing in World War II, when it conducted
amphibious operations near Calais, France, to fool the Nazis into
believing the invasion would happen there instead of at Normandy.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they didn't land at Calais, but they never lied to the world and
said they were going to land at Calais," Rumsfeld said last week of the
World War II effort. "What they did do is they did a whole series of
activities that led people--the Germans--to believe they might land at
Calais. And that would be called strategic influence or information
operations."</TE>
<TE>   But with today's instantaneous communication and the world's media
blanketing the globe, critics say it becomes almost inevitable that
misinformation aimed at foreign leaders would find its way into
legitimate news reports presented to allies and the American people.</TE>
<TE>   "Deception is a perfectly routine kind of practice in the
military--you may want the other side to have an unrealistic portrayal of
what you can do," said Eliot Cohen, director of strategic studies at
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. "What you're
seeing now is that in a world which is globalized, there is much more
possibility that these things can come back into the main news stream."</TE>

<HD>Commerce Yields to Security Along the Border</HD>
<DH>Trade: Towns along the Rio Grande cope with a slower flow of goods
and services in a post-Sept. 11 environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAREDO, Texas
</DL>
<LD>All eight lanes of the giant World Trade Bridge are packed, Mexican
truck drivers honking and cutting around one another in an hourlong
traffic jam to clear the U.S. checkpoint.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the downtown stores are closed, and police seem to be
everywhere--at the water plant and the tiny airport, at the four river
bridges where federal agents are seizing record amounts of drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Before Sept. 11, Laredo and the other major U.S.-Mexico border
crossings seemed headed for an era of unprecedented openness, born of a
mandate from the top levels of government to integrate the two countries
politically and economically as never before.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the security crackdown triggered by the terrorist attacks has
dramatically changed life on the border--even though none of the
terrorists who crashed planes into the Pentagon and World Trade Center
entered the United States from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with U.S. Customs and the [Immigration and Naturalization
Service] at the border is that, after Sept. 11, they felt there was some
kind of terrorist problem here too," said Rene David Mejia Quintana, the
Mexican consul alternate with offices in Laredo.</TE>
<TE>   "So right now everything is much more difficult. We are never going
back to Sept. 10."</TE>
<TE>   The silver lining, most agree, is that tougher law enforcement and
greater security should pay off in the long run for border towns whose
history of lawlessness is legendary. Laredo, for example, has begun
advertising to tourists that its border is much safer now.</TE>
<TE>   But to prosper, towns like El Paso and Laredo depend on an open
border. Community coffers and merchants thrive on the free flow of
tourists and shoppers and cargo traffic. Now these communities are
adapting to a new reality that prosperity takes a back seat to security.</TE>
<TE>   In El Paso, for instance, Veronica Callaghan, who helps run Casco
Ventures, an international warehouse operation, said lost revenue from
bridge tolls has cost her city about $80,000. About 70,000 Mexicans
holding day jobs in El Paso have been laid off. Crime is up, she said,
and tourism is down; profits at her own company have slumped 13%.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been economical, social, psychological, cultural. . . .
Everybody has had to make some significant adjustments," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry is struggling. In San Diego, Stephen Gross has seen profits
at his Border Trade Services warehousing company fall 15%.</TE>
<TE>   "The new focus is on the safety of our country. That's a mind-shift
for us all," he said. "This is not a short-term issue. This is now the
way it's going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Tougher security is not alone to blame. The whole U.S. economy has
sputtered since Sept. 11, posing unique consequences for businesses and
jobs along the border. Fewer American tourists can afford vacations, for
example, and those who can have been further dissuaded by the unusually
mild winter in the northern United States--causing a drain on local
revenue. Meanwhile, falling U.S. demand for consumer goods, many of which
come from Mexico, has cut into long-haul cargo traffic back and forth
across the border.</TE>
<TE>   That helps explain another post-9/11 phenomenon on the border: a
dramatic falloff in arrests of illegal immigrants bound for the United
States. With fewer U.S. jobs available, and improvements in the Mexican
economy under President Vicente Fox, apparently many migrants are
thinking twice before journeying north to the U.S. in search of work.</TE>
<TE>   City officials in Laredo and elsewhere insist that the economy is
improving and that enhanced law enforcement ultimately will be good for
tourism and trade. But frustration still hangs heavy over the border,
much like the thick gray exhaust from the belching trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody honks," said Joe Villarreal, a customs supervisor surveying
the trucks trying to maneuver past the increased U.S. police presence on
the World Trade Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican drivers carry goods to local warehouses and, earning $20 a
haul, they are in a hurry to clear customs and hopefully return for two
more runs before the day is out.</TE>
<TE>   But since Sept. 11, customs is conducting more inspections, more dogs
are sniffing out drug traffickers and trucks are being picked at random
for special X-ray examinations. All of this ties up traffic, which ties
up nerves.</TE>
<TE>   "They honk because they get angry, and they are angry," Villarreal
said. "They honk all day. There could be two trucks on the bridge and
they would still be honking at each other."</TE>
<TE>   In the last three months of last year, customs officers seized 392
pounds of cocaine in Laredo, a ninefold increase from a year earlier.
Marijuana seizures doubled, to more than 42,000 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Recently arrested were a 72-year-old man with a load of marijuana
hidden in a propane tank in his pickup truck and a middle-age woman with
41 pounds of cocaine in the spare tire and back door panels of her Ford
Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   For the U.S. Border Patrol, charged with arresting illegal immigrants,
the last three months of 2001 saw the number of apprehensions drop 22%.
"Our numbers are down, but we're still going out. We're still looking,
we're still busy," said Supervisory Agent Louie Wayne Collins.</TE>
<TE>   George A. Gunnoe, assistant chief patrol agent, expects the
apprehension numbers eventually to slide back up. "We will always have a
job."</TE>
<TE>   Quintana at the Mexican consulate said that border towns on the
Mexican side have also hit hard times. Drugs that cannot get to the U.S.
are piling up there, and drug lords are fighting one another. And for
many of the same reasons as on the U.S. side, tourism is slumping--down
35% since Sept. 11 in Nuevo Laredo, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   "Either side of the border is vulnerable," Quintana said.</TE>
<TE>   Many migrants still come north, but most are poor and uneducated, and
seem oblivious to how America was transformed on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't watch the news," said Jose Guadalupe Rodriguez, a 27-year-old
from Guanajuato apprehended here while headed to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the news reports when the buildings fell," said Julio Bonilla,
36, from Mexico City, also detained after trying to make his second trip
to Milwaukee. "But I was coming back here whether or not it happened."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, local boosters take the only position they can: that it
will get better.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Romani, project coordinator for the Laredo Convention and
Visitors Bureau, said her city lost about 30% in revenue when tourism
fell and hotel rooms stood empty. But some of that revenue is slowly
picking up again, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She and others note with irony that it took a foreign terrorist attack
to help solve some of the problems with drugs and illegal immigration on
the Southwest border.</TE>
<TE>   "Security comes first; we all accept that," Romani said. "This is our
way to show that Laredo is as patriotic as anybody."</TE>

<HD>Emotions High as Pharmacist Pleads Guilty to Diluting Drugs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>They had known in advance what he would say. But the cancer
patients packed into a Kansas City, Mo., courtroom on Tuesday still
recoiled in fear and in fury when pharmacist Robert Courtney pleaded
guilty to diluting their chemotherapy drugs with salt water.</LD>
<LD>   Courtney, shackled and struggling against tears, admitted to diluting
158 infusions of the drugs Taxol and Gemzar for 34 patients.</LD>
<LD>   He also agreed to tell federal authorities about any other
prescriptions he may have tampered with. Investigators believe there
could be quite a list.</LD>
<TE>   Lab tests show that six other cancer-fighting drugs from his pharmacy
in Kansas City were diluted before patients received them, FBI spokesman
Jeff Lanza said. A fertility drug from a second pharmacy that Courtney
owned in Kansas also turned out to be diluted, Lanza said. And many other
prescriptions Courtney filled still are being tested.</TE>
<TE>   Under his plea agreement, Courtney, 49, will not face any additional
charges as long as he fully discloses his criminal activities. He faces
17 1/2 to 30 years in federal prison for the counts he pleaded guilty to
Tuesday. In addition, a federal judge has frozen his assets--now worth up
to $12 million--and will draw up a plan to distribute the bulk of the
funds to his victims.</TE>
<TE>   Choking over his words as many in the courtroom around him sobbed,
Courtney apologized to those victims, saying he could not explain why he
had cheated them of the drugs they were counting on to save their lives.
In the past, he had told investigators that the scheme netted him profits
he needed to pay $600,000 in back taxes and make good on a $1-million
pledge to his church.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, Courtney said there was no "rational explanation" for
his actions.</TE>
<TE>   "I am guilty," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And later: "I am extremely sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Watching him, cancer patient Delia Chelston was surprised to find
herself in tears. She was crying in frustration for the months or years
she might have lost; battling advanced ovarian cancer, she believes that
three of the six chemotherapy treatments she received from Courtney were
worthless. She tries not to think of those wasted infusions, but her mind
loops back insistently: How many moments in her garden might she have
lost? How many hugs from her grandchildren? Those questions were in her
tears Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But she also was crying--unexpectedly--for the pharmacist. She had
built him up in her mind as a monster. "He must not have a conscience,
really," she had thought. In court, in his orange prison jumpsuit, he was
so human that she buckled.</TE>
<TE>   "In my estimation, if they had told him, 'An electric chair is right
behind you and there's someone here ready to throw the switch,' he would
have gone to sit in it," Chelston said. Hearing his contrition "made me
feel a little bit better."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Atwood also took some comfort in the proceedings. His wife,
Adelia, died of ovarian cancer a year ago. She had received $84,000 worth
of chemotherapy from Courtney's pharmacy. Atwood is convinced that
Courtney cheated his wife--if not of a cure, at least of time, of
strength, of a fighting chance. "She was shorted of her life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He had looked forward, he added, to watching Courtney's trial, which
was due to start in less than two weeks. "I wanted to sit there and look
mean at him, maybe growl a bit." He did not get that chance Tuesday; with
every seat in the courtroom taken, he had to crowd with dozens of other
victims and family members into a side room to watch the hearing on
closed-circuit TV. Still, Atwood said, he was fairly content with the
plea agreement--especially the proviso that Courtney come clean about any
other patients who may have received diluted drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, FBI agents and Food and Drug Administration investigators
plan to begin grilling the former pharmacist on that subject early next
month. They would not comment Tuesday on how many drugs they suspect he
diluted or how many patients might have been affected</TE>
<TE>   Courtney's attorney, Jean Paul Bradshaw, also said that "it would be
inappropriate" to discuss such numbers now. His client, he added, "is
relieved to be able to come in and accept responsibility for what he has
done."</TE>
<TE>   Jailed since he surrendered to the FBI on Aug. 15, Courtney has been
stripped of his license and has sold his two pharmacies. His wife and
four children have been able to tap some of his money for living
expenses, Bradshaw said, but the bulk of his fortune will be doled out as
restitution to the 34 victims named in the criminal case and to some of
the 300 others who have filed civil lawsuits against him.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Djibouti pilot jailed in Arizona after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal charges of Social Security
fraud and lying on a political asylum application.</LD>
<LD>   Under a plea agreement, Malek Mohammed Seif, 36, would voluntarily
leave the country if a federal judge approves the deal at a sentencing
hearing April 22.</LD>
<LD>   Seif, who has been detained in Phoenix since October, was not charged
with involvement in the East Coast attacks. But he caught investigators'
attention because of his acquaintance with Hani Hanjour, who is suspected
of having steered American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, Seif, also known as Malek Mohammed Abdallah, trained at
the same Phoenix-area flight school as Lotfi Raissi, who was detained in
England for five months during a global anti-terrorism probe. Raissi,
once accused of helping train some of the hijackers, was released on bail
this month when prosecutors failed to produce hard evidence linking him
to the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Seif, a French citizen who left Arizona shortly before the attacks,
was coaxed by the FBI to voluntarily return in October. He was arrested,
hours after his arrival in Phoenix, for alleged identity fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of additional charges were later added, including filing false
claims of political persecution to obtain asylum.</TE>
<TE>   Under a plea agreement, Seif pleaded guilty Tuesday to the two felony
violations and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. He has already
provided information to investigators, according to his attorney, Thomas
Hoidal. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to discuss
the value of that information.</TE>

<DL>SOMERSET, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>The remains of United Airlines Flight 93's passengers and crew, who
were lauded as heroes of the Sept. 11 attacks for their revolt against
hijackers, are being readied for their final journey home, officials said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities in rural Somerset County, where the Boeing 757 crashed
into a field during the attacks on Washington and New York, said the
remains of 40 people who died aboard the flight will be placed in
full-sized coffins, paired with their belongings and returned to family
members. All 44 passengers and crew members along with four hijackers on
board were killed when the plane crashed 80 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   "The plan is to begin moving them from the morgue this week," said
Susan Hankinson, Somerset County's coordinator for post-Flight 93
affairs.</LD>
<TE>   Identification of remains included DNA analysis by the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology.</TE>
<TE>   Unidentifiable remains could be entombed at the crash site as part of
a memorial to those who died, officials said.</TE>

<HD>700 National Guard Troops, Minus Guns, Will Bolster Security at
Canadian Border</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Ashcroft, in a heated Senate hearing, defends the
$1.1-billion plan to strengthen immigration safeguards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>More than 700 National Guard troops will begin patrolling the
U.S.-Canadian border within the next several weeks as part of a major
campaign to gird the nation against possible terrorist attacks, officials
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities plan to combine the influx of National Guard personnel
with a proposed $1.1-billion plan for ratcheting up immigration
safeguards, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft told members of a Senate panel. But
his vision for how law enforcement should work in the age of
anti-terrorism came under fire from Democratic lawmakers who accused him
of doing too little, too late.</LD>
<LD>   In a confrontational scene that was more reminiscent of Ashcroft's
bruising confirmation battle than of the more recent, post-Sept. 11
climate of political unity, lawmakers attacked Ashcroft on everything
from immigration to Enron Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats wanted to know why the National Guard troops being put in
place on the Canadian border won't be carrying guns, why the Bush
administration is moving to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funds
for local street cops, why it is relinquishing control of some terrorist
response plans to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and why
Ashcroft refuses to bring in an outside counsel to investigate the Enron
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's handling of the Enron issue proved to be a
particular sore spot, as Ashcroft withstood tough questioning from
senators on both sides of the political aisle.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft has recused himself from the Justice Department's
investigation into the Enron affair because of political contributions he
received from former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and other executives while
Ashcroft was a U.S. senator. Virtually the entire U.S. attorney's office
in Houston is also recused from the case because of Enron connections.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft named his chief deputy, Larry Thompson, to oversee the Enron
investigation. But a growing chorus of Democrats in Congress has
suggested in recent weeks that Thompson may have the appearance of a
conflict because his former law firm in Atlanta represented both Enron
and Andersen, the accounting giant implicated in the alleged destruction
of Enron documents.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee that held Tuesday's hearing, commended Ashcroft for recusing
himself from the case in order to avoid any possible tainting of the
criminal probe. But he urged Ashcroft to appoint an outside counsel,
saying that with Thompson in charge, "the appearance of a conflict is
still there, just like yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft refused to discuss the matter under repeated questioning from
Hollings and others. The logjam prompted an exacerbated Hollings to
declare that the attorney general's silence "almost sounds like the 5th
Amendment these guys [from Enron] are taking. . . . You can't recuse
yourself from reality. You've got to get with the program and make a
decision."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department reaffirmed its stance after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone working on the Enron matter at the Justice Department has
every confidence in the independence and absolute integrity of Deputy
Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson. There is no basis for the deputy attorney
general not to fulfill his duties and responsibilities in this matter,"
said department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron questioning was a distraction from the business at hand for
the attorney general: securing more money in next year's federal budget
to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   A key front in that battle, Ashcroft said, will be toughening the
nation's borders through $856 million worth of proposed improvements in
the immigration system, in addition to $187 million funded by Congress in
the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said there is a "new and urgent" need for bolstering
immigration defenses and other homeland security. The increased
immigration funding would go toward beefing up patrol forces on the
nation's borders, strengthening intelligence-gathering and technology
systems, reducing the numbers of illegal immigrants and building new
border facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate push will come on the Canadian border, with the
assignment of the 700 National Guard troops beginning in the next few
weeks, Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Under a temporary six-month assignment, the troops are expected to
provide support for border forces in air operations, cargo inspections,
traffic management, pedestrian control and administrative services in an
effort to head off terrorist threats. Canada has been home to several
Islamic terrorist cells dating back to at least the mid-1990s, with an Al
Qaeda-trained terrorist from Montreal stopped north of Seattle in 1999
before he could carry out a plot to bomb Los Angeles International
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) questioned
why it has taken so long to get northern border agents the relief they
need--especially when security-related delays are putting a strain on
commerce in northern states.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said she was also concerned that the National Guard troops will
not be armed, which could "severely limit their ability to guard the
border."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said that decision grew out of the fact that the United
States does not want to "militarize" the border. "Our friends in Canada
are appropriately sensitive that we don't signal that we are somehow
arming the border," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at a separate Senate hearing, several lawmakers said they
are convinced that the nation's ports remain vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   "There is much more we can do to ensure the safety and integrity of
our seaports and the communities surrounding them," Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) said, noting that virtually none of the cargo containers
shipped to the United States undergo inspections. A small percentage are
examined after their arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Steinke, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, called
for increased funding for both ports and federal agencies but he said
stepped-up security plans must be developed at the local level.</TE>
<TE>   "Because each port has unique characteristics, a one-size-fits-all
approach does not work," said Steinke, who is also head of the American
Assn. of Port Authorities.</TE>

<LD>Republican foes of campaign finance reform legislation signaled
Tuesday that they probably will not try to talk the bill to death through
a filibuster or other delaying tactics, even as they continued to review
their dwindling options for blocking it.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no desire to delay this indefinitely," Senate Minority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said of the bill, which aims to diminish the
influence of big-money contributors in politics.</LD>
<LD>   Reform proponents are pushing for the Senate to approve the version of
the bill passed by the House earlier this month. That would send the
legislation to President Bush, who would then be under heavy pressure to
sign it into law.</LD>
<TE>   Lott and others who oppose the bill still are exploring ways to amend
it. That could either slow its progress or send it to a House-Senate
conference committee, where proponents fear the measure could be buried.
The filibuster option, however, seems to be receding.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a leading opponent of the bill, has
arranged to meet today with one of the main reform advocates, Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), to discuss how the bill will be handled on the Senate
floor. While McConnell has not yet conceded defeat, he is now striking a
more conciliatory pose than in years past, when he relied on filibusters
to kill similar reform legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we ought to be able to come to agreement on how, in an
orderly fashion, to complete the bill," McConnell said Tuesday. The
measure's main provision would ban the unlimited, loosely regulated
contributions to national political parties known as soft money.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview on CNBC on Tuesday night, McCain said he anticipates
cutting a deal with McConnell that will lead to the bill's Senate
passage. His optimism was based in part on the expectation that his side
has the 60 votes needed to thwart a filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the prospects for killing the bill with a filibuster sustained
a blow late Monday when Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) said he would not
support such a move. Nelson was one of three Democrats to vote against a
version of the bill the Senate approved last year, 59 to 41.</TE>
<TE>   Several senators have been shifting their positions in recent days on
a filibuster. But Nelson's announcement made it increasingly likely the
bill's proponents could choke off such an effort.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like we may be moving toward a resolution of the campaign
finance issue without a filibuster," said Sen. Russell D. Feingold
(D-Wis.), who joined McCain in sponsoring the Senate version.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Senate debate on another bill has sparked an effort to
revive a proposal that would require television stations and networks to
offer more favorable terms to politicians buying advertising time.</TE>
<TE>   The provision would prevent stations from preempting political ads
even if another advertiser offers to pay more for the same spot. Stations
are already required to offer politicians discounted rates. But many
candidates complain that their ads often air in the wee hours of the
night, bumped from prime-time spots whenever a station can find a higher
bidder.</TE>
<TE>   Language barring such preemptions was contained in the campaign
finance bill the Senate passed in April. But amid lobbying from the
broadcast industry, the provision was discarded in the House version.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), the provision's principal backer, has
moved to attach it as an amendment to a bill that would help states
upgrade their election machinery. A Senate vote is scheduled on the bill
today.</TE>

<HD>Jeffords Turns Into Headliner for Democrats</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Senate independent will start raising money to help
keep the power balance. His move is bound to anger his former party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont infuriated his Republican
colleagues last spring by single-handedly giving Democrats control of the
Senate with his defection from the Grand Old Party. Now he's about to
make them angry all over again.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to help Democrats keep or improve their one-seat edge in
the Senate, Jeffords appears tonight as the headline speaker at a major
Democratic fund-raiser. Perhaps more irksome to Republicans, his
appearance at the $10,000-a-plate Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee dinner is a coming-out party--the start of a sustained effort
by the Senate's only independent to elect Democrats to the chamber.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans admit that Jeffords gets under their skin but insist they
are not worried about his role in the 2002 elections. "He's just going to
rile up our base," said Dan Allen, press secretary to the National
Republican Senatorial Committee. "He's been an obstructionist to
[President Bush's] agenda. People know who he is and what he did."</LD>
<TE>Fund-Raiser Likened to One's First Prom</TE>
<TE>   Jeffords described his fund-raiser gig as "like going to the prom for
the first time," even as he admits his dealings with Democrats have not
been entirely reciprocal. He expressed "great disappointment" that
congressional Democratic leaders were unable to win a significant boost
in federal funding for special education--his most cherished policy goal.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he has no regrets that he made his change, arguing it is
better to be aligned with a party that is willing to fight for causes he
believes in than with one he thinks is not. And with the GOP in charge of
the White House and the House of Representatives, Jeffords said, keeping
the Senate Democratic is the only way to ensure "a more moderate balance
of power in Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic officials say ticket sales to tonight's fund-raiser at
Washington's Union Station are "going through the roof." Some
contributors bought seats with no intention of attending, and the party
expects to raise $6.1 million from the event.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the attraction is the importance of the battle for the Senate.
But Jeffords clearly is a strong draw; gratitude to him among Democrats
runs deep.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who would still be
overseeing the Senate's minority party if not for Jeffords' jump,
frequently ends his speeches by saying he's sorry he has to leave, but he
has to go mow Jeffords' lawn.</TE>
<TE>   The line gets a laugh, but it underscores how Jeffords reshaped the
political landscape when he declared himself an independent.</TE>
<TE>   Now Daschle is hoping Jeffords' cachet will help fire up the
Democratic faithful, translating into victories in November. Of the 34
Senate seats up this year, about 10 are considered competitive. These
include races in Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire and South
Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans shrug off Jeffords' potential as a campaigner, saying they
have a stronger card to play.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said his party has "a wonderful chance to
regain control of the Senate," especially if Bush, as expected, actively
stumps for GOP candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had a president since Ronald Reagan who was so popular,"
said Cochran.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle thinks Jeffords is an especially potent weapon for
Democrats, a reminder that one person can make a difference in politics.
In his recent speech to the California State Democratic Convention in Los
Angeles, Daschle included Jeffords in the litany of politicians he
singled out for praise. He termed Jeffords' defection a decision "that
changed the course of history."</TE>
<TE>   The remark sparked a roar of approval from his audience of party
stalwarts.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffords has attached one condition to his work for the Democrats: He
will not campaign against any of his former GOP colleagues. (Commented
Cochran: "That's interesting, but I don't know if there's anything he can
do to make Republican senators like him.")</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Jeffords gave a hint of the message he plans to
deliver on the stump once his schedule has been arranged.</TE>
<TE>   "The president believes there is an urgency to drill for oil in the
Alaskan wilderness. I don't share his views," Jeffords said. "The
president does not believe we need to include carbon as a main pollutant
as we move to stem the ill effects of greenhouse gases. I believe we
must."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "You get the idea. That is why I will be speaking at the
Democrats' dinner."</TE>
<TE>Lott Describes It as 'a Coup of One'</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it may be difficult to
recall why Jeffords' decision so dominated the news. But at the time, it
rocked Washington to its core.</TE>
<TE>   Then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) called it "a coup of
one."</TE>
<TE>   Other Republicans bemoaned the loss of committee chairmanships they
had worked a lifetime to obtain. Jeffords' son was so angry he threatened
to name his first-born Reagan Nixon Jeffords. The senator was greeted by
men wearing Benedict Arnold costumes. And there were death threats.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffords, for his part, seems proudest of the independence his move
showcased. In a speech in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this month, he noted
that Vermont was the first state to outlaw slavery and the first--months
before Pearl Harbor--to declare war on Germany. "In many ways, my
maverick spirit is a reflection of my home state," he said.</TE>

<HD>Many 'Injured by the Helping Hand'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The following are excerpts from the speech President Bush delivered
on welfare reform:</LD>
<LD>   America began a war on poverty more than three decades ago. A story of
good intention but conflicted results. There were important successes, no
doubt about it; there were some good successes.</LD>
<LD>   Yet many Americans . . . were injured by the helping hand. The welfare
system became an enemy of individual effort and responsibility, with
dependence passed from one generation to the next. Between 1965 and 1995,
federal and state spending on poor and low-income families increased from
around $40 billion to more than $350 billion a year.</LD>
<TE>   Yet . . . we made virtually no progress . . . in reducing child
poverty. And the number of children born out of wedlock grew from 1 in 13
to 1 in 3. By the mid-1990s, few denied there was need for change. In
sweeping reforms passed by Congress, welfare benefits were transferred
into temporary help, not a permanent way of life. The new system honors
work, by requiring work, and helps people find jobs.</TE>
<TE>   States are required to promote independence, and they are given the
flexibility to seek that goal, in new ways, with dollars that were once
used for welfare payments, for example, now being used for child care and
other ways to help working families.</TE>
<TE>   Critics initially called these changes brutal and mean-spirited. Yet
the results of reform have proven them wrong. Many lives have been
dramatically improved. Since 1996, welfare caseloads dropped by more than
half. Today, 5.4 million fewer people live in poverty than in 1996,
including 2.6 million fewer children. Child poverty for African American
children is at its lowest level ever. For the first time in generations,
the out-of-wedlock birthrate has leveled off, and the unwed teen
birthrate has declined since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts try to dismiss all these gains as the product of good
economic times. Yet we have had good economic times before and the number
of people on welfare went up.</TE>
<TE>   We ended welfare as we've known it, yet it is not a post-poverty
America. Child poverty is still too high. Too many families are strained
and fragile and broken. Too many Americans still have not found work and
the purpose it brings.</TE>
<TE>   . . . We will strengthen the work requirements for those on welfare.
Work is the pathway to independence and self-respect. Yet, because of a
quirk in the 1996 law, states on average must require work of only 5% of
the adults receiving welfare. This is certainly not what Congress had in
mind when it wrote the reforms in 1996. So I'm recommending that the law
be changed and every state be required within five years to have 70% of
the welfare recipients working, so that more Americans know the
independence and the dignity of work.</TE>
<TE>   . . . At the heart of all these proposals is a single commitment to
return an ethic of work to an important place in all American lives. . .
. We will work to strengthen marriage. As we reduce welfare caseloads, we
must improve the lives of children. And the most effective, direct way to
improve the lives of children is to encourage the stability of American
families.</TE>

<HD>Court Voids a Death Penalty for the 4th Time</HD>
<DH>Law: In latest reversal over one month, a San Francisco appeals
panel overturns the sentence and guilty verdict in a Washington state
case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the fourth time this month, a federal appeals court in San
Francisco has overturned a death sentence.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling Tuesday by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has
jurisdiction over California and eight other Western states, overturned
both the death sentence and the guilty verdict of Gary Benn, who was
convicted of killing two people in Puyallup, Wash., in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The four overturned death sentences were the most the court has
ordered in a month. The three other reversals came in cases from
California. All the cases date to the 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling comes at a time of considerable ferment over the death
penalty nationally and in the state of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Washington Supreme Court overturned three death
sentences, the most in any year since the state enacted its new death
penalty law in 1981. Since then, 30 individuals in that state have
received death sentences and half have been reversed, for a variety of
reasons. In addition, six of the guilty verdicts were overturned.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Supreme Court is considering changes in the methods
used to appoint lawyers to defend capital cases because of revelations
last year in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer about poor representation by
defense lawyers. The newspaper found that one out of five defendants in
capital cases in Washington had been represented by attorneys who had
been or were later disbarred, suspended or arrested.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit ruled that Pierce
County, Wash., prosecutors had improperly failed to disclose information
about a jailhouse informant who testified that Benn had confessed the
crime to him in jail.</TE>
<TE>Judges Say Prosecutors Had Duty to Disclose</TE>
<TE>   The case is one of a growing number in recent years where convictions
or death sentences or both were overturned by courts after post-trial
revelations that cast serious doubt on the veracity of a jailhouse
informant.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court said Tuesday that prosecutors had failed to disclose
a voluminous amount of information that would have cast doubt on the
credibility of a key witness. The appellate judges said that the
prosecutors had a clear duty to turn over this information under the
landmark 1963 Brady vs. Maryland decision of the U.S. Supreme Court,
which requires that prosecutors provide defense attorneys with any
information that might exonerate their client.</TE>
<TE>   The informant's credibility was so suspect that some Pierce County
detectives had written a formal memo deactivating the informant, Roy
Patrick, stating that he could not be used any more because he would not
abide by department rules. The defense was never told about this, the 9th
Circuit said.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense also was not informed that Patrick had broken into the
evidence room of the California Bureau of Narcotics while he was working
as an informant and had stolen drugs that the police had previously
seized," Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court.</TE>
<TE>   "Nor was the defense told that, as a result of this offense, Patrick
was charged with burglary and numerous counts of obstruction of justice
and ultimately pled guilty to burglary," Reinhardt wrote. His opinion was
joined by judges William A. Fletcher and Stephen S. Trott.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the prosecutors failed to inform Benn's defense lawyers
that Patrick had admitted making false charges in prison on a fraud
conviction in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Patrick had believed that he could get his time reduced if he
reported the presence of firearms within the prison. He therefore had
shotguns smuggled into the prison and then told the officials that he had
found them. The prison officials discovered the scheme, and Patrick's
prison sentence was extended," Reinhardt wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, during Benn's trial, the Police Department of another county
in Washington submitted reports to the Pierce County prosecutor
requesting that Patrick be charged with burglary.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecutor's office entered an 'NCF' [no charges filed] the same
day that closing arguments ended in the penalty phase of Benn's trial.
This fact was never disclosed to the defense," Reinhardt wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Patrick's credibility problems, the 9th Circuit
chastised the prosecutors for failing to disclose information that cast
doubt on the underpinnings of the case--the prosecution theory that Benn
had murdered two men to keep them from telling police about his role in
an alleged insurance fraud scheme involving arson.</TE>
<TE>'Misleading' Report Turned Over to Defense</TE>
<TE>   Part of the alleged scheme involved a fire at Benn's trailer in
December 1987. A report by fire inspectors concluded that the fire was
accidental. But prosecutors turned over to the defense a report that was
"misleading," and failed to disclose the fire inspector's conclusion tha
the fire "could not have resulted from arson," Reinhardt wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit held that both the prosecutor's failure to disclose
information about Patrick and about the fire report standing alone would
be a violation of the prosecution's obligations under the Brady decision.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court also ruled that the Washington Supreme Court had
made a "clearly erroneous ruling" when it upheld the conviction. The
state Supreme Court said that even though the prosecution had failed to
meet its disclosure obligations, Benn had not been prejudiced.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Trott, who was both a state and federal prosecutor before being
appointed to the appeals court by President Reagan, wrote a trenchant
concurring opinion excoriating the Pierce County prosecutors in even
stronger language than used by Reinhardt, who is one of the most liberal
judges on the 9th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "The law and the truth-seeking mission of our criminal justice system,
which promise and demand a fair trial whatever the charge, are utterly
undermined by such prosecutorial duplicity," Trott wrote. "Such
reprehensible conduct shames our judicial system."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle attorney Suzanne Lee Elliot, who represented Benn on appeal,
said: "I think the 9th Circuit hit the nail on the head. If a prosecutor
is going to use a jailhouse informant, the jury has a right to know how
dirty that snitch is."</TE>
<TE>   John Samson, an assistant state attorney general, said he was not sure
if Washington would seek review from the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   If the decision stands, Pierce County "absolutely" will retry Benn,
said Barbara Corey-Boulet, chief deputy in the felony division of the
Pierce County prosecuting attorney's office. "We think we still have a
solid case. Roy Patrick is now dead, but he was not a critical witness."</TE>

molestation scandal targeting the Catholic Church in Boston, Cardinal
Anthony Bevilacqua issued a statement recognizing the "pain, humiliation

<HD>Town's Solicitor Law Debated</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court: Most of the conservative justices take up the free
speech claims of the Jehovah's Witnesses in the door-to-door permit case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court justices debated Tuesday a tiny Ohio town's limit
on door-to-door solicitation to decide when the 1st Amendment's freedom
of speech overrides a homeowner's right to privacy and personal security.</LD>
<LD>   The Jehovah's Witnesses, who took the issue to the high court, say the
Constitution gives them the freedom to "go door to door to speak the good
news," as their lawyer put it.</LD>
<LD>   "This involves pure religious speech or pure political speech," their
attorney, Paul Polidoro, told the court. "We don't believe you can be
required to go to the government for permission before you speak to your
neighbors."</LD>
<TE>   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist objected to Polidoro's claim
and defended the town's ordinance. "You call them neighbors. I take it
they are strangers," he said, referring to the Witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The village of Stratton, an Ohio River town with 300 people and one
police officer, said it wanted to protect its residents--many of whom are
senior citizens--against "scams and frauds" by "canvassers, solicitors,
peddlers and hawkers."</TE>
<TE>   Its ordinance requires solicitors to register at the mayor's office
and disclose their name and purpose. No fee is required, and permits are
granted in all cases, the town's lawyers say.</TE>
<TE>Government Groups Want Law to Be Model</TE>
<TE>   The National League of Cities and the state of Ohio urged the high
court to uphold the Stratton ordinance as a model.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very modest restriction. It only affects those who want to
go on private property. And it puts a record on file" of who is going
door to door, said David Gormley, a lawyer for the state.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist noted that a recent newspaper account of the slayings of two
Dartmouth College professors reported that the teenagers accused of the
crime had gone door to door, checking out homes before they picked the
victims.</TE>
<TE>   City officials want to deter "con men" as well as dangerous criminals
from operating freely in the community, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rehnquist's usual conservative allies took up the free speech
claims of the Jehovah's Witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1930s and 1940s, the Supreme Court struck down a series of
city laws that targeted the Jehovah's Witnesses and sought to bar them
from communities.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Antonin Scalia said he was surprised that city officials today
would think they could enforce such a law.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not selling goods. If you want to talk about Jesus Christ or
talk about protecting the environment," the government cannot prevent
that, he said. "You say this ordinance is OK because it only addresses
communication," Scalia said mockingly.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he too was "astounded" by the
ordinance. "You say I have to get the government's permission before I go
down the block to talk to my neighbors . . . about the garbage
collection," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor picked up the theme, noting that the
ordinance as written would cover trick-or-treaters at Halloween or
carolers at Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "What if I want to borrow a cup of sugar from a neighbor? It literally
covers that," O'Connor told the town's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Defending the ordinance, attorney Abraham Cantor said the city simply
wants to register solicitors. "It is an aid to law enforcement. And it's
an aid to the elderly," because it gives them a greater sense of security
about people who knock on their door.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers disagreed when asked about houses that have "No
trespassing" or "No soliciting" signs posted. The attorney for the
Jehovah's Witnesses said such requests are honored, while the city's
lawyer said they have no way to enforce such a warning when it is
ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Lurking in the background of this case is an issue that worries the
advocates of campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   The Jehovah's Witnesses are relying on recent high court rulings that
have declared a right to "'anonymous speech."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, for example, the Supreme Court struck down an Ohio law that
resulted in a $500 fine against Margaret McIntyre, a housewife, who put
hand-printed leaflets on car windshields urging a no vote on a school
bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said McIntyre had violated its disclosure law on
political mailings, but the high court said the 1st Amendment protects
"anonymous pamphleteering."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the McIntyre vs. Ohio decision had been used by some
candidates in California to attack as unconstitutional the state law
requiring disclosures on mass mailings.</TE>
<TE>   The McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill also requires
candidates and parties to file disclosures on their campaign spending.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hoping the court will clarify this and uphold the disclosure
requirements," said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at Loyola
Law School in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hasen filed a brief in the Jehovah's Witnesses case drawing attention
to the drawback of declaring a broad 1st Amendment right to "anonymous"
political speech.</TE>
<TE>   During the argument, Justice Stephen G. Breyer noted that the case
"might have considerable legal implications for the disclosure of
campaign contributions."</TE>
<TE>   The justices will hand down a ruling in the case of Watchtower Bible
and Tract Society vs. Village of Stratton, 00-1737, in several months.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>In what is believed to be a medical first, a woman with a gene that
is all but certain to cause Alzheimer's by her 40s gave birth to a baby
free of the defect after having her eggs screened and selected in the
laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   The child's mother, whose name was not released, now 33 and a
health-care professional in Texas, had tested positive for the rare
genetic mutation.</LD>
<LD>   She opted to use a new technique, preimplantation genetic diagnosis,
or PGD, to prevent bearing a child with the mutation. There is no similar
test for the more typical form of Alzheimer's, which strikes the elderly.</LD>
<TE>   The baby was born healthy 18 months ago, without the mutated gene for
Alzheimer's. The mother is now pregnant with twins, also created with the
help of the screening technique.</TE>
<TE>   The case is published in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn.</TE>

<LD>I made the mistake of slumping into the Barcalounger and flicking on
the TV this week, which is always dangerous in the middle of a
political campaign. In one creepy ad after another, political
candidates marched into my den like body snatchers, sapping me of the
will to live.</LD>
<LD>   Millions have been spent on distortion, simplification and insult,
and may the best man win.</LD>
<LD>   "A 30-second spot is, by its nature, distorting," says Barbara
O'Connor of the Center for the Study of Politics and Media in
Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   But what about the candidate who can't afford the price of
distortion? Let's say you're not made of gold, like Dick Riordan and
Bill Simon in the Republican primary. And unlike Gov. Gray Davis, you
don't climb out of bed every living day with your suit on and your
hand out, looking to roll every Joe and his great-granny who cross
the street.</TE>
<TE>   How are you supposed to pay for the kind of TV ads that can
manipulate human emotion, insult voters' intelligence, and get the
victory you're after?</TE>
<TE>   I saw so many ads for Dick Riordan and Bill Simon, each of whom
could buy every minute of TV air time between now and election day, I
began feeling sorry for lowly Bill Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, the secretary of state, might be the most solid candidate
of the three. But that stands for next to nothing in a modern
election. The critical issue is that Jones has spent only a fraction
of what his opponents have on TV ads, and he's so far back in the
woods, he's "The Man Who Wasn't There."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has got to take drastic action, I thought. If I were he, I'd
set fire to a Riordan or Simon billboard and then lead police on the
longest slow-motion car chase in California history.</TE>
<TE>   "You should hijack a truck," I told Jones by phone Tuesday as he
left a fund-raiser in Visalia on his way to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Jones told me he'd raised $40,000 in Visalia, which is a
respectable haul. But Simon and Riordan could write themselves
$500,000 checks with $40,000 pens.</TE>
<TE>   A truck, I told Jones again. Hijack a truck or a white Bronco.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I could demand equal time," he said agreeably.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't have to. TV news spent more time covering Valentine's
Day than the months-long gubernatorial campaign, but give them a good
car chase, and regular programming will be interrupted from San Diego
to the Oregon border.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was gamely telling me he's going to pull this thing out, but
he isn't happy about being overshadowed by two opponents entirely on
the basis of their wealth. And in that regard, he's got more in
common with voters than his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "The average person loses confidence in a contest that's
pay-to-play," Jones said. "You're really up against it when you're
running against someone as wealthy as Simon, who hasn't voted in a
decade."</TE>
<TE>   I'd disagree that the average person has lost confidence. The
average person's eyes have completely rolled back in his or her head.
The average person is entirely cynical and tuned out, which explains
why Barbara O'Connor is hearing forecasts of a 28% turnout on
election day Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   For years, a guy named Paul Taylor has been arguing that if
everyone is so thoroughly disgusted by a polluted system in which
candidates beg for money, and public policy is for sale to campaign
donors, we ought to seriously consider fixing it.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reform, which finally appears to be a
possibility, is one of his causes at the Alliance for Better
Government in Washington, D.C. But another has to do with the problem
Bill Jones is looking at right now.</TE>
<TE>   "If you stop someone on the street and ask who owns the airwaves,
they'll probably say CBS does, or NBC, or Fox," Taylor said. "They
don't realize the public owns the airwaves."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor has been haranguing the government to require that in
return for a broadcast license, TV stations offer more free air time
for candidates and more coverage of the issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Political campaigns are a cash cow for the TV stations," Taylor
said. And yet while they rake in millions on ads that distort the
truth, they devoted on average about a minute per broadcast to
coverage of the last campaign for governor in California.</TE>
<TE>   "TV hates political coverage because they think viewers run from
it," he said. "But I think it ought to make for good television.
You've got drama, competition, and some suspense, and even the most
cynical citizens are smart enough to know this has some meaning to
their lives."</TE>
<TE>   I still think Jones should hijack a truck.</TE>
<TE>   As for you weary and cynical citizens of the republic, there's one
solution you might consider while waiting for the federal government
to make TV news do the honorable thing.</TE>
<TE>   Read a newspaper.</TE>

<HD>Neighbor Pleads Not Guilty to Kidnap-Murder of 7-Year-Old</HD>
<DH>Courts: Suspect is formally charged in the death of girl
whose body has not been found. A conviction could bring the death
penalty.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A suburban San Diego man pleaded not guilty Tuesday to kidnapping and
murdering 7-year-old Danielle van Dam, while the girl's mother wept
and trembled at the sight of him.</LD>
<LD>   David Alan Westerfield, 50, was formally charged with slaying the
impish youngster who nearly a month ago vanished from her home two
doors away from his. The charge carries a "special circumstance" that
will allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty, a decision they
said they have not reached.</LD>
<LD>   A day earlier, prosecutors announced their conclusion that
Danielle, missing since the morning of Feb. 2, is dead, even though
no body has been found.</LD>
<TE>   Westerfield was also charged with kidnapping a child under the age
of 14, another felony, and possession of child pornography, a
misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have said they discovered the pornography during a
search of Westerfield's home in Sabre Springs, a well-groomed
community north of San Diego. They declined to explain the charge
further, though the criminal complaint they filed Tuesday says the
images were of children younger than 18.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the charges were filed, Westerfield, wearing a
white shirt and black tie and standing with his hands clasped in
front of him, entered his plea in a clear voice that resonated
through the tense and crowded courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Then you deny the charges?" San Diego County Superior Court Judge
Peter C. Deddeh asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sir," Westerfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's mother, Brenda van Dam, dressed in black and wearing a
button with a picture of her only daughter, gasped when Westerfield
walked into the courtroom from a holding cell. "Oh my God," she said,
bringing her trembling hands to her mouth as court officers and her
husband, Damon, attempted to comfort her.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no words to express the anguish we feel as Danielle's
parents and greatest admirers," Brenda van Dam said two hours later
as she and her husband stood on their front lawn to deliver a
statement to the media. "We miss Danielle desperately. The pain of
her absence is unbearable."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two dozen television cameras were outside their home,
broadcasting the couple's words around the world from a cluster of
satellite trucks. Authorities had said Westerfield, who is being held
without bail, might also be charged with burglary. But that charge
was not brought in the criminal complaint filed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "A burglary charge is unnecessary," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff
Dusek, lead prosecutor in the case. "He's charged with murder."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor also told the public that he believes he can win a
murder conviction even if Danielle's body is never found.</TE>
<TE>   His office has cited four cases in which San Diego suspects were
convicted of murder though investigators have never found the
victims' bodies. For example, in 1992, Kerry Lyn Dalton was arrested
in connection with the torture-murder of a woman in an isolated
inland community. The body was cut up and buried and never found, but
Dalton, along with two acquaintances, admitted his role in the
killing and was sent to death row.</TE>
<TE>   Outside San Diego, several high-profile Southern California cases
have ended with similar results. Last year, Orange County prosecutors
convicted a Newport Beach man of murdering his wife during a 1997
boat cruise. Prosecutors say Eric Bechler dumped his wife's body at
sea and then tried to collect on her $2-million life insurance
policy. They convicted him of first-degree murder although her body
was never found.</TE>
<TE>   "You people make more of a deal out of a 'no body' case than we
do," Dusek said. "Put your notebook down and be a real person for a
minute. Do you think she's dead? What more do I need?"</TE>
<TE>   The case has captured the attention of the San Diego area, and the
media glare has been intense, whether from national tabloids or
"America's Most Wanted," whose host, John Walsh, sat behind
Danielle's parents Tuesday in court.</TE>
<TE>   The attention became the subject of debate Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's defense attorney, Steven Feldman, asked the judge to
impose a gag order prohibiting attorneys, law enforcement officers
and potential witnesses--which could include Danielle's parents--from
discussing the case publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Deddeh denied the request, and a testy Feldman marched out of the
courthouse after the hearing to admonish reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "The adverse publicity will affect our client's right to get a
fair trial," he said. "Stop guessing as to what the facts are."</TE>
<TE>   Feldman would not specify what, if any, false information has been
disseminated through media reports.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek said he believes Westerfield can receive a fair trial in San
Diego--a trial Dusek hopes will begin within a year. He opposed the
request for a gag order but said he would prefer that the "media go
away."</TE>
<TE>   Biggest Search Yet Planned for Weekend</TE>
<TE>   In continuing efforts to recover Danielle's body, organizers of a
massive search operation pledged to launch their most extensive
effort yet this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask that you adopt Danielle as one of your own," Brenda van
Dam urged area parents in her statement to the media. "Step forward
to volunteer this weekend to help search for her."</TE>
<TE>   But San Diego Police Chief David Bejarano said in an interview
Tuesday that hope of finding Danielle has all but vanished.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst nightmare for any parent," he said. "It's
difficult for the community."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle was missing from her second-floor bedroom when her
parents went to wake her on the morning of Feb. 2. The previous
evening, Brenda van Dam spent time with friends in a bar in nearby
Poway, where she ran into Westerfield.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam has said the two only spoke briefly. Westerfield
has said they also danced together.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Westerfield was the only one of the Van Dams' neighbors
who was not in the neighborhood the morning Danielle disappeared.
They immediately focused on him as a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say they believe Westerfield took his motor home to
the desert for several days after Danielle's disappearance, then had
it cleaned before they could inspect it. But they said they found
traces of blood on his clothing and in the motor home and DNA tests
confirmed that the blood came from Danielle.</TE>

<HD>His Big Step Is Santa Ana's Too</HD>
<DH>Police: A lieutenant credited with pioneering beat patrols
becomes the city's first Latino captain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An officer who championed Santa Ana's community policing program more
than two decades ago will become the first Latino police captain in
the department's 116-year history.</LD>
<LD>   George Saadeh, who grew up in Honduras and sold flowers from
street corners in Los Angeles as a teen, Friday will begin managing
the department's largest bureau--the 200 officers who patrol the
city's streets.</LD>
<LD>   Latino rights activists said Saadeh's promotion helps the
credibility of a police department in a city that has the largest
percentage of Spanish speakers in the nation.</LD>
<TE>   Amin David, president of Los Amigos of Orange County, said the
lack of a Latino in the top ranks of the police department has been
only a "soft issue" in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that they have a lot of Hispanic officers," said
David. "It's just a matter of time, especially in a city as unique as
Santa Ana."</TE>
<TE>   When Police Chief Paul M. Walters was rumored to be in the running
for the top law enforcement post in Riverside County recently, city
leaders predicted Santa Ana would get its first Latino police chief.</TE>
<TE>   But Walters didn't leave. He said there hasn't been a Latino in
the top ranks of the department until now because there hasn't been
an opening in a dozen years.</TE>
<TE>   In a city where 74% of the residents speak Spanish, Santa Ana's
671-member police force is 51% Latino, tops in the state.</TE>
<TE>   David said the increase in Latino officers and promotions of
people like Saadeh--currently a lieutenant--has helped smooth out the
relationship between police and the Latino community, which
deteriorated in the early 1990s when officer-involved shootings
increased.</TE>
<TE>   For Saadeh, 47, the promotion marks a return to the streets. He
has spent the last four years in internal affairs and investigating
officer-related shootings. "I'm thrilled I'll be able to work with
the community in a way again," Saadeh said.</TE>
<TE>   Evangeline Gawronski, a lifelong Santa Ana resident and president
of the Community Oriented Policing Assn., said she met Saadeh at
community meetings 25 years ago when the Community Oriented Policing
program was reintroducing a walking-the-beat-style of policing. "He
gives us a feeling of security," said Gawronski, "that we're not
alone."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest of three children, Saadeh was born and raised in
Tegucigalpa, Honduras, but moved with his family to Los Angeles in
1970 when he was 15. He said it was a quick cultural immersion. He
learned English in six months, sold flowers for $1 a bundle to earn
spending money and decided to study business at the University of
Redlands. He met his future wife while working in the men's suit
department at Montgomery Ward. They now have two daughters, 13 and
11, and live in South County.</TE>
<TE>   He switched his major to law enforcement and--at the age of
20--was hired by Santa Ana in 1975. "I wanted to come home at night
and feel good that I helped someone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, burglaries and auto thefts in Santa Ana were at a
peak. As a rookie, he was credited with putting together the
Community Oriented Policing program, which is now standard in many
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Saadeh and other officers trained new officers to get out of their
patrol cars and talk with people in the community. They held
meetings, passed out pamphlets and held nightly walks with neighbors
to improve neighborhoods one block at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew in order to get the community involved, we have to reach
out to them and make them stakeholders," said Saadeh. Santa Ana
community members became the eyes and ears of the department,
reporting crimes when many immigrants were skeptical or afraid of
police.</TE>
<TE>   "Being born somewhere else brings a different perspective to a job
because you understand the culture," said Saadeh.</TE>
<TE>   Gawronski said Saadeh has earned respect, neighborhood by
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a person who listens to the people who live in the
neighborhood and takes their concerns into consideration," said
Gawronski.</TE>

<HD>Bar Assn. Won't Rate Judge in Sex Case</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Bar Assn. took a stand against two candidates for
state judgeships, but decided not to evaluate Superior Court Judge
Ronald C. Kline or any of the write-in challengers vying for his
post.</LD>
<LD>   Kline, who is facing pornography and child molestation charges,
holds one of five Orange County Superior Court seats that will be up
for grabs in the March 5 election.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Millar, bar president, said the group decided it would be
better to allow justice to take its course than rate Kline, who has
been under house arrest since November.</LD>
<TE>   "On the one hand, the charges against him are simply charges and
have not been proven," he said. "On the other hand, if they are true,
they would disqualify him from serving time on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   As for Kline's 11 challengers, Millar said the association
evaluates only candidates whose names appear on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In the four other races, all triggered by retirements , the
association found that Mark E. Farrar, a Cosa Mesa trial attorney
specializing in insurance fraud, and Vickie Ann Bridgman, a deputy
district attorney specializing in white-collar crime, are "not
recommended."</TE>
<TE>   Farrar is running for Office No. 27 against Deputy Dist. Atty.
David Brent of Irvine and Glenda Sanders, a Newport Beach attorney
and professor who once defended black men accused of crimes under the
apartheid system in her native South Africa. Brent was found to be
"qualified" and Sanders "highly qualified."</TE>
<TE>   Bridgman's challengers for Office No. 22 are fellow Deputy Dist.
Atty. Kelly MacEachern, who was deemed "qualified," and Michelle L.
Palmer, who did not submit to the bar's rating process.</TE>
<TE>   Farrar and Bridgman were miffed by their low marks.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have undertaken this project if I didn't think I was
qualified and I didn't think I could do an excellent job," Bridgman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, who did not participate in the rating process when he ran
unsuccessfully in March 2000, said jokingly that aside from his
picture he has no idea why he received the association's poorest
rating. "I'm befuddled and so are all of my endorsers," he said.
"I've got 26 years of trial experience.... What more do they want?"</TE>

<HD>Big-Screen Fan's Not-So-Good Buy Prompts Sony's Goodbye</HD>

<LD>In any tussle between a corporation and the little guy, it's smart to
bet on the corporation.Unless that little guy happens to be Mike
Scott, who lives in Newport Beach, owns a car wash in Fullerton and
likes big-screen TVs. When it came to his viewing pleasure, he always
considered himself a Sony man. Technically, he's still a Sony man,
because the small living room in his beachfront home is dominated by
one of its 55-inch models.</LD>
<LD>   How long he stays in the fold, however, provides the punch line
for today's slice of life in this wacky world of ours.</LD>
<LD>   Sad to say, but Scott, 59, and Sony have had a falling-out that
looks permanent. Scott says his TV developed some quirky habits that
should have been covered by a one-year warranty.</LD>
<TE>   Sony denies the TV was defective, but with Scott refusing to budge
and ready to go to court, the electronics giant paid him $4,500 (the
approximate cost of the TV) following a settlement conference.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the fun part: The company insisted on including this
language in the settlement: "[Mr. Scott] agrees that he will not
purchase or otherwise obtain or receive a Sony product of any type in
the future."</TE>
<TE>   Wow. A lifetime Sony ban. Luckily for Scott, the ban doesn't
include watching or listening to anything on a Sony.</TE>
<TE>   Or, maybe the company just forgot to add that.</TE>
<TE>   I translate Sony's legalese as, "Nyaah-nyaah, you can't buy any
more of our stuff never, ever, ever again!"</TE>
<TE>   If it sounds like the two had a history, they did.</TE>
<TE>   This is Scott's third big-screen Sony in the last few years. It's
also the third he's said had a defect.</TE>
<TE>   The first two go-arounds, the sets were replaced under a five-year
warranty he bought from the dealer. When he bought his current set,
the dealer wouldn't sell him the warranty, so he was covered only by
Sony's one-year arrangement. Within a few months, Scott says, the new
TV was acting up. This time, Sony refused to replace it.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the sets appears to be the salt air at Scott's
small beachfront home, which has done a number on everything from
Scott's blinds to the legs on his bar stools. He says a
Sony-authorized repairman told him there was corrosion inside the
set. On one visit, Scott says, the repairman used a blow-dryer to get
the TV working again.</TE>
<TE>   It's pretty obvious Sony is fed up with Scott. Sony's lawyer once
asked him if he was pouring saltwater on the TV's parts.</TE>
<TE>   "They said [the TV's problem] was an act of God," Scott says. "Act
of God, because I live next to a beach? God destroyed my TV?
Lightning, a storm, stuff like that, that's an act of God. I don't
consider air an act of God."</TE>
<TE>   I asked Laura Citrano, Scott's attorney, if someone can be banned
from buying a product. "That's a good question," she says.
"Originally, they wanted to waive the warranty. That's unenforceable,
so they tried to go at it another way by saying he can't buy another
of their products. But I don't think they'll have somebody following
Mike around seeing what he's purchasing."</TE>
<TE>   Jilana Miller, Sony's lawyer in the case, says she can't comment.
A Sony spokeswoman said she wasn't familiar enough with the
settlement to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement it reached with Scott, the company denies the
set is defective.</TE>
<TE>   You are still watching it, I say to Scott. Yes, he says, but he
leaves it on 24 hours a day, switching over to a radio component
during the night or when he's not watching TV.</TE>
<TE>   Why? "When I turn it off, it never comes back on," he says. "To
me, that's kind of abnormal."</TE>
<TE>   Sony may think Scott is scamming them, but I don't buy that. He
and Citrano say his attorney fees could be $10,000 and rising if he
went to court.That's twice what a new TV would have cost him.</TE>
<TE>   I think Sony simply ran into a buzz saw with Scott, not thinking
he'd push things as far as he did. He says he pursued matters because
he felt bullied and, as a businessman, objected to Sony's treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he agreed to the lifetime ban. I ask how he felt about
that.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's their coup de grace," he says. "They think they win
if they can tell me I can never buy another one of their products. As
if I would."</TE>

<HD>Orange School District Settles Two Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Courts: One deal covers two fired employees. The other ends
a lengthy dispute with a local developer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange Unified School District has settled lawsuits with a local
land developer and with two fired employees who had alleged they were
terminated as political payback.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, the board voted unanimously, with one member
absent, to pay $263,852 to Judith Frutig, the district's former
spokeswoman, and $190,897 to Barbara Bowen, a risk manager who was
reinstated. The district agreed also to pay the women's attorneys'
fees of $64,000.</LD>
<LD>   The pair sued the district, its superintendent and trustees last
May, alleging their bosses had targeted them for speaking out against
alleged improper practices by the district, such as political mailers
and changes to employee benefits.</LD>
<TE>   The district maintained that the women were let go as cost-saving
measures. It admits no wrongdoing under the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The case had become political fodder in the pitched battle last
year for control of the board between the teachers union, which took
Frutig and Bowen's side, and the old guard in the board.</TE>
<TE>   The old board majority has since been ousted. Board President
Robert Viviano said he hopes the settlement will turn a new chapter
in the district.</TE>
<TE>   "Litigation takes serious money from the general fund," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen, who returned to her job Feb. 19, said, "It is just
wonderful to be back. The whole atmosphere has a different feel to
it."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone was happy.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Davis, a trustee ousted in the recall and a defendant in the
case, said, "The district squandered hundreds of thousands of dollars
that should have gone to classrooms and teachers' salaries."</TE>
<TE>   The board also voted at its Feb. 14 meeting to settle a
two-decades-old financial dispute with the developer of the Serrano
Heights project, SunCal Cos.</TE>
<TE>   SunCal and the district had battled over the amount of developer
fees to compensate the district for the expected growth in school
enrollment in the Anaheim Hills area.</TE>
<TE>   SunCal sued the district in 1999 claiming it was being
overcharged. Under the settlement, approved by five trustees with one
member abstaining and another absent, SunCal agreed to pay $1 million
in fees and another possible $2.4 million in the next 18 months,
depending on further development on remaining parcels. District
officials said the money will be used to provide additional classroom
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The developer also agreed to build a playing field and parking lot
at Anaheim Hills Elementary.</TE>

<HD>Burbank Mayor Gets a New Job</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burbank City Manager Bud Ovrom reviewed 16 applicants for the job of
city ombudsman. The man he ultimately hired happened to be his own
boss.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Kramer, who used to help evaluate Ovrom's performance,
resigned as Burbank's mayor Monday to take the less-prestigious but
better-paying gig.</LD>
<LD>   "I was fair to Bud," said Kramer, 55, a retired painting
contractor whose mayoral term would have expired next year. "So now I
hope he's fair to me."</LD>
<TE>   The ombudsman job pays $3,965 to $4,817 a month (Ovrom declined to
reveal Kramer's exact salary). That's a big jump from the roughly
$1,000 monthly stipend Kramer received for his part-time work on the
City Council, which rotates the mayoralty.</TE>
<TE>   Ovrom and City Atty. Dennis Barlow said no favoritism was involved
with Kramer, who went through the normal hiring process.</TE>

Jeopardy Foundation. It also will pay for renovation of a gymnasium
on Glenoaks Boulevard in Pacoima and expansion of a computer lab for
middle school and high school students.</LD>
<LD>   Funds will also allow for creation of a youth center where young
people can go to receive work skills training, job placement
assistance and counseling.</LD>
<TE>   The Valley Youth Initiative is a five-year, $9-million job

<LD>San Juan Capistrano officials must require a developer to stabilize a
hillside that partially collapsed in 1998 during El Nino storms,
damaging or threatening five homes, a judge has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   SunCal Cos. of Anaheim contributed to the collapse while grading
for the Pacific Point project, Orange County Superior Court Judge
William F. McDonald ruled last week in a lawsuit homeowners filed in
May 2001 against the city and the developer of the 256-acre project.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Curtis, forced out of his Meredith Canyon home after the
landslide, said the ruling was a victory for the homeowners.</LD>
<TE>   "This means they're going to have to make the homes stable so that
they can be lived in again," Curtis said. "In order to do that,
they'll have to put the hill back. The judge ruled the developer had
a duty to support the hill and they didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the city and SunCal said they have not decided whether
to appeal the judgment, which ordered the developer to formulate a
plan to stabilize the hillside within 60 days. John Shaw, attorney
for San Juan Capistrano, argued before McDonald that the city's
original agreement with the developer said the city was not required
to stabilize the hillside. Lawyers for the homeowners argued that the
hillside should have been stabilized early in the project.</TE>
<TE>   The homeowners also have lawsuits pending against SunCal and the
city of San Juan Capistrano for damages for the value of their homes
and relocation expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis' house on Via La Mirada is the only home still declared
uninhabitable. Owners of the other homes could be evacuated if there
is more slippage.</TE>

<HD>Bamieh Raises $1 Million in Race for County D.A.</HD>
<DH>Election: The money, most of it from his father, makes it
one of the costliest campaigns in the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fueled by late contributions, candidate Ron Bamieh has now raised an
unprecedented $1,067,000 in his bid for Ventura County district
attorney--far outpacing his opponent, Greg Totten, and making it one
of the costliest races in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly all of the money pouring into Bamieh's coffers is from his
multimillionaire father, who in the last week made four late
donations totaling $155,000.</LD>
<LD>   That brings San Mateo businessman Sam Bamieh's total contributions
in the district attorney's race to $983,000, more than any individual
has ever given in a Ventura County race, election officials said
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   With Totten raising nearly $400,000, mostly in small donations
from attorneys and ranchers, the March 5 primary election race is
proving to be one of the most expensive waged in California for a
district attorney seat.</TE>
<TE>   "For the size of the county, this would certainly appear to be one
for the record books," said Larry Brown, executive director of the
California District Attorneys Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hard pressed to recall a medium-sized county district
attorney race hitting anywhere close to seven figures," Brown said.
"And probably even compared to larger counties it is among one of the
more costly races for district attorney in California."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh has raised about as much money as former Los Angeles Dist.
Atty. Gil Garcetti did during his reelection campaign two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh, who has worked in the district attorney's office for nine
years, said he needs the money to compete with Totten's endorsements.
Totten, the second-in-command in the prosecutors office, is supported
by retiring Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury and most of the county's law
enforcement establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't expect to take on a group of people who have run this
county for years without resources," Bamieh said. "To break that
cycle, it is going to take an aggressive effort."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, large contributions continue to pour into other local
races.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reports show businessman Randy Hoffman received
$50,000 last week from Camarillo resident Edward Atsinger III, who
runs a string of Christian radio stations. Hoffman and Thousand Oaks
City Councilwoman Linda Parks are vying to replace retiring county
Supervisor Frank Schillo.</TE>
<TE>   State Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) received a $25,000
donation for his reelection campaign from Miller Brothers
Investments, a Calabasas developer involved in a controversial
land-swap deal with the city of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   But the big money has been flowing into the district attorney's
race, where, as with all county races, there are no contribution
limits. The race is expected to yield a blitz of mailers and radio
and television ads in the closing days before the election.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Totten received a $50,000 loan from an Oxnard investor
and law school friend, Allen Camp. It is the largest loan to his
campaign fund, which has increased gradually with small donations
from about 750 contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, campaign finance reports show Sam Bamieh donated
$222,000 in the last nine days to his son's campaign for district
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Bamieh--a major GOP contributor and the largest
individual donor in the 1994 gubernatorial race--dropped $10,000 into
his son's war chest Tuesday. He also donated $75,000 on Monday,
$30,000 on Friday and $40,000 last Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Those late donations prompted Totten to renew allegations that Ron
Bamieh is trying to buy the election. He predicted that it will
backfire on election day.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are hearing out in the community is that people don't
like this," Totten said. "I think when this race is over, there will
be a call for campaign finance reform here in Ventura County. The
public does not like people buying political offices."</TE>

<HD>Use of City Letterhead for Endorsement Draws Fire</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley: Barbra Williamson's council colleagues say her
statement of support for Ron Bamieh is misleading. That's 'silly,'
Bamieh says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley City Councilwoman Barbra Williamson's endorsement of
district attorney candidate Ron Bamieh on city letterhead looked
pretty official.</LD>
<LD>   But the phone number for City Hall was one digit off. The city's
Web site wasn't quite right. And a disclaimer in small print at the
bottom of the mailer explained that the letter was paid for by the
Bamieh campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The other four council members--all of whom support Greg Totten,
Bamieh's opponent in the county race--said this week that Williamson
had no business implying that the city supported one political
candidate over another.</LD>
<TE>   Williamson said the erroneous telephone number and Web site were
caused by a printer's equipment improperly scanning the letterhead.
Bamieh's campaign people proofread the text of her endorsement but
not the details of the letterhead.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time the Bamieh campaign has blamed a printer
for erroneous information. Last week, the candidate blamed a printing
mix-up for a slate mailer claiming that the 36-year-old Bamieh had 12
years' experience as a judge and 21 years' experience as an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The latest brouhaha has put Williamson and Bamieh in the hot seat
just days before the March 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting this week, the City Council voted to order a staff
study to determine if a new ethics code is needed to avoid such
problems in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make it very clear that city government is
apolitical," Councilman Paul Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   It has also brought chaos to the quiet home of a Jehovah's Witness
whose telephone number appears on the stationery.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she was
caught off guard by a barrage of phone calls condemning the
endorsement letter.</TE>
<TE>   She isn't even registered to vote. "It's against my religion," she
said. "Jesus is the ruler of God's kingdom."</TE>
<TE>   Williamson has apologized to the woman for the inconvenience,
paying her $300 for her trouble and picking up her most recent phone
bill at a cost of $22.65.</TE>
<TE>   But she said she won't apologize to her colleagues or to voters,
because she didn't do anything wrong. As of now, she points out,
there is no policy that prohibits using private money to promote a
candidate on a council member's city stationery.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Williamson said, Mayor Bill Davis did just that two years
ago when he drew up a letter on paper with the city logo supporting
state Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge). That wasn't a scandal
because the other council members supported Richman, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Tuesday he probably would not use the city logo again
in an endorsement letter. At the same time, he said his letter did
not imply a city endorsement because it did not contain the city's
address or telephone number.</TE>
<TE>   "This mock moral outrage, it's silly," Bamieh said Tuesday. "We're
seven days away and I think what upsets them the most is that this
network of old-time politicians is about to lose an election." Totten
has the overwhelming support of elected officials throughout the
county, including retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson said she won't support Totten "just because the good
ol' boy club says this is the guy. They're entitled to be upset, I
guess. But when they start saying what I did was unethical, I take
exception with that."</TE>

<HD>Expo Nurtures Kids' Curiosity</HD>
<DH>Education: Science fair sponsored by Boeing employees puts
theory into hands-on action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Linda St-Cyr was a little girl, she asked her parents for a
chemistry set. Their response was, "Girls don't do that."</LD>
<LD>   When she got a little older, St-Cyr wanted to know how cars
worked. She got the same answer.</LD>
<LD>   Now an engineer with Boeing, St-Cyr, 49, said she wants every
curious child to be exposed to science. To that end, she coordinated
more than 70 experiments at a science fair sponsored by Boeing
employees at the Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power plant in Canoga
Park.</LD>
<TE>   The Rocketdyne Science Expo, a Valley tradition for more than a
decade, gives elementary school children a chance to practice what
their teachers preach and exposes them to concepts that will be
reinforced later in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "You see it first and then someone will tell you the physical
theory," St-Cyr said as she uncoiled a Slinky-like device used in a
sound experiment. "It's the two and they should be in balance.
Practice and theory."</TE>
<TE>   Boeing will welcome more than 1,200 elementary school students
this week from the San Fernando, Conejo and Simi valleys. Unlike in
their classrooms, students are encouraged to run around, touch and
feel and yell and shout. The experiments explore topics such as
sound, light, mechanical energy, fluids, heat and magnetics and
require hands-on interaction.</TE>
<TE>   "At school we learn about math and science, but we never do
anything like the things we do here," said 9-year-old Alejandro
Martinez, a fourth-grader at Camellia Avenue Elementary School in
North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more popular tables had the hair on kids' heads
literally standing on end. Scotty MacLeod, a volunteer at the Boeing
event who works as a lab technician in the Moorpark College physics
department, operated the Van de Graff generator.</TE>
<TE>   The static-electricity gadget allows kids to place their hands on
a metal orb as electrons travel up through their fingers, into their
arms and out into their hair follicles.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Northridge students from First Presbyterian Weekday
School laughed with fifth-grader Jessica Lucatorto, 11, as her sandy
brown hair flew up.</TE>
<TE>   "See, science can be fun," MacLeod said, standing nearby.</TE>
<TE>   He is one of only a few outside volunteers at the expo. More than
170 current and former Boeing employees run the experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Senior, an electronics technician at Boeing, has worked at the
expo for four years. He says it makes sense to encourage children to
pursue "rocket science."</TE>
<TE>   "As a technician, I need engineers. These kids are the engineers
of the future. They're going to put us on Mars," Senior said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the students will not grow up to be rocket scientists,
St-Cyr said, but at least they will know it is an option.</TE>
<TE>   "[My parents] tried to convince me I couldn't play with these
things," she said. "Well, I showed them."</TE>

<HD>Traffic Signal Project on Fast Track</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Synchronization across the Valley will be
completed much sooner than expected, meaning drivers could shave up
to 15% from their travel time as early as next year, report says.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic signals at hundreds of San Fernando Valley intersections will
be synchronized as early as next year, reducing drive times by up to
15%, a transit advocacy group says.</LD>
<LD>   In a report to be released today, the Valley Transportation Strike
Force says its lobbying efforts shaved at least two years off the
traffic signal synchronization project.</LD>
<LD>   The city of Los Angeles originally planned to complete it by 2005
or 2006, the report says.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Katz, co-chair of the advocacy group, said his
organization jump-started the project by persuading the California
Department of Transportation to provide the city with technical
support.</TE>
<TE>   The synchronization is part of $820 million in transportation
improvements planned for the Valley. The others include a bus
corridor from Warner Center to the North Hollywood subway station and
carpool lanes on the Golden State Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley Transportation Strike Force has sought to accelerate
transit projects in the region to ensure that they don't lose their
funding.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making a difference in helping improve the Valley's
mobility," said Katz, a former state assemblyman.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for the city Department of Transportation declined to
comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   The advocacy group includes representatives of the Economic
Alliance of the San Fernando Valley, the United Chambers of Commerce
of the San Fernando Valley, the Automobile Club of Southern
California and Washington Mutual Bank.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the 135 employees working on the Seventh-day Adventist Church's
worldwide radio and television programs, life just got a lot easier.</LD>
<LD>   Since relocating to Simi Valley seven years ago from smaller
studios in Newbury Park, the media ministry has endured major
construction on the $15.9-million Adventist Media Center at 101 W.
Cochran St.</LD>
<LD>   The center became fully operational this month when the final
22,000 square feet of studio space were added.</LD>
<TE>   "Now we can do the programs in half the amount of time with half
the amount of people," said Warren Judd, chief executive of Adventist
Media Productions, the 20-member group that produces all the church's
radio and television programs.</TE>
<TE>   The center produces four main Adventist programs: "Voice of
Prophecy" and the Spanish-language "La Voz de la Esperanza" radio
shows, and the "Faith for Today" and "It Is Written" television
broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   With the recent studio addition, the center now can produce all
its programs completely in-house. Until now, videotaping had to be
done on location or in rented studio space.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the biggest things the new facility means is we have
increased production capacity," said Kermit Netteburg, president of
the Media Center. "We have excellent state-of-the-art equipment that
allows us to do our work of bringing people closer to Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   The new equipment includes the latest digital audio, television
recording and editing tools. Combine that with digital satellite
transmission equipment and the center can broadcast programs in more
than 40 languages all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the four main radio and TV programs, the center
provides support services for two other media ministries, "Breath of
Life" and "LifeTalk."</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley facility also contains general office space for an
Adventist advertising agency called Transda, several dressing rooms
and two waiting rooms for the radio and TV personalities and their
guests.</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley center--with two television studios, four audio
studios and six video editing suites--is twice as large as the
facility in Newbury Park, which was sold to Amgen Inc.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 6,000 square feet and a ceiling two stories high,
Studio A will be used for larger programs and can accommodate a
studio audience.</TE>
<TE>   The backdrop--or cyclorama--encircles the entire studio, making it
one of the largest on the West Coast. With the help of special
lighting, it can simulate outdoor conditions such as a sunset,
sunrise, cloud-filled sky or a rainbow. Studio B, at 2,400 square
feet, has similar features.</TE>

<HD>Deuces Are Wild at Classic Car Showcase</HD>
<DH>Exhibition* The Petersen Automotive Museum will pay homage
to Ford's venerable '32 coupe this week to mark the model's 70th
anniversary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Derek de Heras, it was a no-brainer. When it was time to buy the
hot rod he'd always wanted, it had to be a '32 Ford.</LD>
<LD>   The little deuce coupe immortalized in the Beach Boys' eponymous
ballad, the '32 Ford is "the classic body style with the classic
lines," said De Heras, head of operations at his family's plastic
packaging materials plant in Arcadia.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, devotees of the deuce, as well as cognoscenti of the
coupes and roadsters and sedans and even trucks that rolled out of
the company's plants in and around Dearborn, Mich., 70 years ago, say
that everything else pales in comparison with the smooth, flowing
lines of a 1932 Ford.</LD>
<TE>   Several hundred of them will be crowding into Los Angeles' museum
row this week for Deuce Day at the Petersen Automotive Museum--a
celebration Saturday of the 1932 Ford's 70th anniversary. Organized
by Checkered Flag 200, a museum support group, the event will be open
to the public from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In 1932 Ford started fitting the doors flush with the upper body's
framework instead of overlapping them. "That's one way you can
quickly tell the difference between a '31 and a '32," said De Heras,
who bought his deuce hot rod three years ago and is about to treat it
to a complete restoration. The '32's front end also was far more
aerodynamic than in the past, with a streamlined surround and grille
that hid the radiator.</TE>
<TE>   That also was the year Henry Ford gave in and added V-8 models to
augment the standard 4-cylinder models to keep up with the
competition. (Today, hot rodders usually replace the engines with
more modern power plants built from Chevrolet or Dodge engines, but
to be considered stock, a deuce must have a Ford flathead V-8.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, would-be speedsters found the Ford V-8 easy to soup up,
and their pursuit of more and more horsepower led to the birth of the
hot-rod era, which started with the dry-lake racers of Southern
California just before World War II and hasn't yet ended.</TE>
<TE>   For Ford, 1932 was not a particularly great year--the Depression
was going strong, and production volume was at its lowest level since
1914. But the 1932 roadsters and coupes were a big hit with consumers
who had $440 to $485 to spend (Ford wasn't so sure V-8s would catch
on and charged $20 more for its 4-cylinder models.)</TE>
<TE>   These days, a decent '32 in daily driving condition can easily
start at $50,000, and a fully restored model can be triple that
amount.</TE>
<TE>   With something like 20 companies now manufacturing '32 Ford
bodies--two of them in steel, the others in fiberglass--and scores
more making new versions of everything that goes into, under and
around those bodies--enthusiasts say there are more deuces (including
copies) on the road today than there were in 1933.</TE>
<TE>   De Heras, co-chairman of the Deuce Day event, said he expects more
than 300 cars and trucks, with 20 of the 21 body styles Ford built in
1932, from dump trucks and fire engines to touring cars and
roadsters, to be represented.</TE>
<TE>   The flock of Fords, including cars from Connecticut, Washington
and Texas, will be heavy with hot rods, but there will be scores of
stock '32s as well, De Heras said, including six unrestored
originals.</TE>
<TE>   Hot-rod deuces on display will include four that have captured
coveted "America's Most Beautiful Roadster" trophies at the annual
Grand National Roadster Show in Oakland over the years and 25 that
have graced the covers of magazines such as Hot Rod, Street Rodder
and Rod &amp; Custom.</TE>
<TE>   General admission to the museum, which includes admission to the
Deuce Day show, is $7 (with reduced prices for seniors, students and
children); a combined admission and lunch ticket is $18.</TE>
<TE>   The Petersen Automotive Museum is at 6060 Wilshire Blvd. in Los
Angeles. For more information, call (323) 930-7010 or go to

<LD>Detroit has only two vehicles on the American Council for an
Energy-Efficient Economy's annual list of the dozen most
environmentally friendly--or "greenest"--cars for 2002, but the
domestic auto industry holds the lead when it comes to the other end
of the list.</LD>
<LD>   Saturn's SL sedan was 12th on the greenest list (Highway 1, Feb.
6); the Chevrolet Prizm, actually a Toyota Corolla with a Chevy
badge, finished in 11th place.</LD>
<LD>   But nine of the ACEEE's 12 "meanest" vehicles--those with the
worst combined scores for tailpipe emissions, greenhouse gases, fuel
efficiency and the like--are from Ford Motor Co., General Motors
Corp. and Chrysler Group.</LD>
<TE>   The others are from Italy, Germany and Japan: Lamborghini's latest
12-cylinder exotic was sixth worst; a new Mercedes-Benz SUV derived
from a military truck placed eighth; and Toyota's Land Cruiser SUV
and its Lexus sibling finished ninth in the rankings of least
friendly to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Because fuel consumption affects both tailpipe output and
greenhouse gas production, trucks, SUVs and gas-gulping performance
vehicles typically do poorly.</TE>
<TE>   And this year the authors of the ACEEE Green Book, which rates
every passenger car and light truck sold in the U.S., found little to
differentiate among the meanest.</TE>
<TE>   The guide uses a scale of 100 points that no vehicle has come
close to achieving. The greenest vehicle this year, Honda's Insight
hybrid, scored 59 points, and the 12th best, the Saturn SL, scored
38.</TE>
<TE>   But among the meanest, only two points separated No. 1 from No.
12. The best of the worst--the four-wheel-drive Lincoln Navigator
with 5.4-liter V-8, with a mere 12 points--was almost as bad as the
worst of the worst--the four-wheel-drive Dodge Ram 2500 with a
5.9-liter V-8 and just 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   Peaceful Coexistence?</TE>
<TE>   The federal government's new Freedom CAR project to promote
development of fuel-cell-powered vehicles and a national hydrogen
fuel infrastructure isn't likely to interfere with the work of the
California Fuel Cell Partnership, a spokesman for the group says.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership is a public-private consortium, based in West
Sacramento, where several major auto makers have been testing early
versions of their fuel-cell vehicles for as long as a year now.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom CAR (the acronym stands for "cooperative automotive
research") involves only the federal government and the three
traditional domestic car makers; the California partnership includes
several major import auto companies as well as fuel companies,
fuel-cell makers and state and federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   There has been some concern about General Motors Corp.'s
participation in the partnership--the company is suing to block
implementation of the state's Zero-Emission Vehicle mandate and has
not yet moved into its office and garage space at the partnership
facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still keeping a light on for them," partnership spokesman
Joe Irvin said of GM. "We hope to see them here with a car to test by
summer."</TE>
<TE>   Irvin calls the Freedom CAR project "a helpful step" that will
augment and ultimately push beyond the partnership's work. "The
technologies are almost ready. What is lacking and has to be
developed is a way to provide the fuel."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing Freedom CAR last month, federal Energy Department
officials said the program, with a $127-million budget for this year,
will replace the 8-year-old Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, which pushed development of an internal-combustion-engine
passenger car with 80-miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel cells, the system preferred not only by environmentalists but
also by most auto companies these days, use hydrogen to create
electricity on board the vehicle in an electrochemical reaction. The
electricity powers a clean electric motor, and the only tailpipe
emission from converting hydrogen and oxygen to electricity is steam.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government's decision to work with the domestic car
makers on development of hydrogen fueling technologies will be "a
major step forward in bringing fuel cells to the market," said Don
Huberts, chief executive of Shell Hydrogen and 2002 chairman of the
California partnership.</TE>

<TE>Just as small cars and hybrid gasoline-electric power plants
dominated the recently released Green Book list of passenger vehicles
most friendly to the environment, trucks--and that means
Detroit--dominate the annual guide's list of "meanest" vehicles.</TE>

<HD>Hungry for a Hit, Ford's Getting Consumers Primed for a
Blast From Its Past</HD>
<DH>Marketing* Return of the GT40 is a calculated bid to
broaden brand appeal beyond trucks and SUVs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. is reaching into its storied racing history in an
effort to polish an image tarnished by production and quality
glitches, declining sales and deep losses.</LD>
<LD>   Ford, desperately in need of some positive news, is resurrecting
an icon of 1960s speed and performance: the GT40.</LD>
<LD>   It intends to use the modern version as a so-called halo car,
generating interest that will pull shoppers into showrooms.</LD>
<TE>   Only about a hundred of the original GT40s were built: low-slung,
mid-engine racers meant to beat the best in endurance races such as
the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which GT40s won four years straight from
1966 through 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said last week it will build a sleek new street-legal GT40 to
help celebrate the company's 100th anniversary next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our revitalization plan is centered on products," said Chief
Executive William Clay Ford Jr. "The company that builds and delivers
the best cars and trucks wins, and we're going to win. I can't think
of a better symbol of that winning attitude than GT40."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts scoff, saying Ford has established itself in recent
years as a pickup truck and sport-utility maker, with little to offer
car buyers.</TE>
<TE>   But Ford executives, naturally, gush about the new car.</TE>
<TE>   "GT40 is the ultimate Living Legend," said J Mays, Ford's vice
president of design. "It's a true super car with appeal equal to that
of the greatest sports cars in the world, but with the addition of a
heritage no one can match."</TE>
<TE>   Living Legend is the name Ford gives classic cars in its model
lineup that have persevered or been reborn in recent years, including
the Thunderbird, Forty-Nine concept car and the Mustang.</TE>
<TE>   Essential elements of the original GT40, such as the
ground-hugging stance and mid-mounted V-8 engine, will remain in the
resurrected racer, although the new production car will be more than
18 inches longer and nearly 4 inches taller than the original.</TE>
<TE>   The GT40 "is not overwrought with advanced technologies," Mays
said. "While it represents the best of Ford design, engineering and
expertise, it is a no-frills machine. You won't find voice-activated
telematics here, not even power windows--just pure, refined
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Ford wouldn't divulge the production location or numbers,
performance specifications or pricing of the super car-to-be.</TE>
<TE>   But the concept version of the GT40, shown at the North American
International Auto Show in Detroit in January, had a supercharged
5.4-liter V-8 with a six-speed manual transmission. The package
produced more than 500 horsepower and 500 foot-pounds of torque,
capable of propelling the car at speeds in excess of 200 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's Specialty Vehicle Team engineering unit, which also has
designed performance versions of the Ford Focus, Mustang Cobra and
F-Series Lightning pickup truck, developed the GT40 chassis and
powertrain.</TE>

<HD>Assessing Fault in Auto Accidents Is Hit and Miss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every traffic accident is unique, involving a set of human judgments,
road conditions and highway designs that come together for one
instant on one stretch of road.</LD>
<LD>   But accidents share a common outcome: One driver almost always
gets blamed.</LD>
<LD>   Correctly identifying fault in accidents is a major automobile
safety issue, but one that gets little national attention. The system
for determining fault is one of the most important ways that
incompetent or careless drivers are identified and tracked. Accident
reports are raw material for understanding how and why drivers make
mistakes.</LD>
<TE>   But the system has flaws and inconsistencies. Training standards
are uneven among police agencies. Different organizations reach their
own conclusions about fault. And the way police view the matter
sometimes differs from the way insurers and private investigators see
fault.</TE>
<TE>   In the police view of the world, one driver takes an action that
causes an accident. Had the driver not taken the action, the accident
wouldn't have happened. It's called the primary collision factor.
It's as basic as the black-and-white color scheme of a police
cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   "It is rare that we are not able to find fault," said Chief Stan
Perez, head of the enforcement services division of the California
Highway Patrol, the state's largest traffic accident investigation
operation.</TE>
<TE>   But that viewpoint is not without detractors. Many experts say
accident causes often are difficult or impossible to determine and
that police sometimes stretch too far to find them. If these critics
are correct, a lot of drivers are being wrongly blamed by police.</TE>
<TE>   "Fault can be very subjective," said Bill Edmonds, a former
accident investigation officer for the L.A. County Sheriff's
Department who now operates a private investigative service called
Crash Facts. "Is there always a reason or can you always determine
the reason? No."</TE>
<TE>   Police are just one cog in the giant system that determines fault,
however. And other parties don't have the same mind-set as police.
Insurers, state regulators and private investigators often view
accidents in a more complex way.</TE>
<TE>   Although almost every police report renders a judgment about
fault, insurers are given the primary responsibility for determining
fault under state law administered by the Department of Insurance. It
is the insurer's determination of fault, rather than the police
report, that is used by insurers to set a motorist's premium.</TE>
<TE>   "The insurer makes the determination," said Bruce Patton, staff
counsel at the Department of Insurance. "The insurer must give
written notice, the percentage of fault, the basis of the
determination. They must give a written rationale."</TE>
<TE>   In the insurance view of the world, accidents involve shared
fault. And insurers sometimes do not find any fault, either because
they cannot get to the bottom of an accident or because regulations
prohibit finding fault. Under the state guidelines, for example, a
driver who skids out of control on black ice and rear-ends another
car is not at fault.</TE>
<TE>   There are other conceptual differences between the police and the
rest of the system.</TE>
<TE>   Drunken driving is a case in point. The California Highway Patrol
almost always considers a drunken driver involved in an accident to
be at fault, Perez said. But some local police agencies and private
investigators have argued that alcohol by itself is not a cause of
accidents. A drunken driver, although guilty of driving under the
influence, may be a victim in an accident.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary collision factor is not DUI," said Edmonds, who spent
22 years with the Sheriff's Department. "It is whatever caused the
accident, like unsafe speed or unsafe lane change."</TE>
<TE>   Another issue involved with primary collision factors is whether
police seize on the easiest factor to prove rather than the most
relevant. Drivers sometimes are blamed for illegal turns, lane
incursions and disregarding traffic signs when accidents are actually
caused by another driver breaking the speed limit. Under California
law, drivers have the right to expect others to obey the law, but
that right is sometimes shortchanged in accident reports.</TE>
<TE>   Many local police departments provide meager training for officers
who take accident reports. In California, for example, the state
commission that sets training standards requires just 12 hours of
classroom training in accident investigation for patrol officers.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot is that many police reports are weakly documented and
reach unsupportable conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "At least 15% to 20% of the time, insurers don't go with the
police conclusions," Edmonds said. "They hire a private investigator
and look at it. Insurers spend a fair amount of money to
investigate."</TE>
<TE>   If Edmonds is correct, then tens of thousands of drivers are being
wrongly blamed by the police every year in California for accidents
that they did not cause.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials defend their record. Perez cites the agency's high
training standards. Every CHP officer gets 86 hours of training at
the academy and then gets extensive field training. Specialized
high-level investigators take an additional 40-hour intermediate
course and then two 80-hour courses in accident reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I say there has never been an error?" Perez asked. "I can't
say that." But he said he believes the CHP process makes for highly
credible accident inquiries that are as close to perfect as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP review process--in which a senior accident investigator
reviews every accident report written by a CHP officer--is far more
stringent than other police agencies' processes, Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds notes that incomplete and shoddy accident reports
sometimes are intentionally submitted that way.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the time, officers leave information out of reports so
they can go to court, because they get time-and-a-half pay for court
appearances," Edmonds said. "That's what I was taught by my training
officer."</TE>

<HD>Jeep Liberty Recalled for Problems With Air Bags</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler, which earlier this month announced plans to recall
1.6 million Jeep Grand Cherokees in response to a series of accidents
in which the vehicles unexpectedly lurched into reverse, also has
been having problems with its new Jeep Liberty models.</LD>
<LD>   The Chrysler arm of the German American car maker is recalling
102,000 of the 2002 model-year Liberty sport-utility vehicles because
air bags in some have deployed too late in some types of frontal
crashes. Chrysler reported the recall to federal regulators in
December and has begun notifying Liberty owners.</LD>
<LD>   Chrysler also reported last month that it is recalling 50,200 of
its 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs to fix a fuel-valve problem that
may cause spills during fueling.</LD>
<TE>   The recalls were among several in December and January recently
reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The
agency issues a list of earlier recalls each month to alert vehicle
owners who might otherwise have missed notification by car makers.</TE>
<TE>   Other December actions reported to NHTSA included a General Motors
Corp. recall of 75,816 Chevrolet Venture, Pontiac Montana and
Oldsmobile Silhouette minivans and Pontiac Aztek sport-utilities from
the 2001 model year that were built with split bench seats or
captain's chairs that don't meet U.S. standards for a child-restraint
anchor system.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Nissan Motor Co. is recalling 81,393 of its 2000 and
2001 Sentras for installation of a tamper-proof cap over a
headlight-adjustment screw, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   GM alerted NHTSA in January that it is recalling 506,377 of its
GMC Jimmy, Oldsmobile Bravada and Chevrolet Blazer sport-utility
vehicles from the 2000, 2001 and current model years to check and
repair a faulty switch that could cause brake lights and emergency
flashers to stop working;</TE>
<TE>   And as reported earlier (Business, Feb. 13), Ford Motor Co. is
recalling 695,260 of its 1995 Taurus, Mustang and Sable cars because

incorrectly suggested that the two bills supported by Assemblyman Keith
Richman (R-Granada Hills) would financially benefit a medical group in
which he owns stock and which pays him a salary. In fact, one of the
bills creates a review system by which such companies could challenge HMO
contracts perceived as unfair, but it does not guarantee financial
benefits.</LD>
