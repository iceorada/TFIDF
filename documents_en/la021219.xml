<LD>Springtime may seem a long way off, but gardeners know if they want
to enjoy colorful flowers in March and April, they must plant bulbs
now.</LD>
<LD>   Bulbs are marvelous containers of life. They can be as small as
pebbles or as big as your fist. Most of them look like dull, gray
rocks. But every bulb contains tiny roots, a stem for a beautiful
flower and the food it will need to grow and bloom.</LD>
<LD>   When a bulb is planted, its roots begin growing into the soil. The
stem in the middle grows to the surface and becomes the flower. The
fleshy part protecting the stem inside the bulb grows upward to
become leaves.</LD>
<TE>   After the flower fades, its leaves continue to make food for the
plant. Several small, new bulbs, called bulblets, form underground at
the base of each old bulb and store food for the next year's cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, you can see gardeners planting thousands of
dull-looking bulbs at Descanso Gardens. If you return there in the
spring, you will find they have become tulips, daffodils, irises,
hyacinths and other colorful flowers. For more information about the
gardens, please call (818) 949-4200 or visit</TE>

<HD>'The Christmas Cousins'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Time's up, and Jack hasn't thought of a
special gift yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lael Littke</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IT was time to gather around the tree. All of the laughing aunts and
uncles found seats on sofas and chairs. The excited Christmas Cousins
sat on the floor, close to the tree.</LD>
<LD>   Grandpa was in charge. "Tomorrow morning we'll open the presents
under the tree," he said. "But right now we'll find out what special
gifts you're giving this year. Wally, you're the oldest cousin. You
be first."</LD>
<LD>   Wally stood up, holding a guitar. "I've made up a Christmas
Cousins song," he said. "It will help us remember all of our names."</LD>
<TE>   Strumming the guitar, Wally started to sing. Jack knew the tune;
it was "Jolly Old St. Nicholas." He listened as Wally sang:</TE>
<TE>   Christmas Cousins by the dozens,</TE>
<TE>   I will name them all:</TE>
<TE>   There's Wally, William, Jane and Fred,</TE>
<TE>   Jenny, Gail and Paul,</TE>
<TE>   Anne and Rob and Mitch and Joe,</TE>
<TE>   Megan, John and Buzz,</TE>
<TE>   Molly, and there's Jackie too,</TE>
<TE>   He's the youngest cuz!</TE>
<TE>   Jack laughed when he heard his name.</TE>
<TE>   But what if he couldn't think of a special gift? Would they take
him out of Wally's song? Would they say he was too little to be one
of the Christmas Cousins?</TE>
<TE>   Molly gave the gift of a promise that she would clean up the
wrapping paper after all the presents were opened the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   John gave everybody decorated cards in wooden holders he'd made.
They said, "Be kind to one another."</TE>
<TE>   All the cousins gave gifts they'd thought of themselves. Jenny was
the last one before Jack. Her gift was a little stuffed red mouse
she'd made for her friend Lisa, who was sick and had to stay in bed.</TE>
<TE>   Jack still didn't know what he'd give.</TE>
<TE>   Looking out the window, he wished he'd gone to spend Christmas Eve
with the old horse and the cows, the way he'd thought about doing
during dinner. They looked so cold and lonely outside in the barn.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly Jack knew what special gift he was going to give.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Jack announces his gift. What will it be?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixteen months after her death, R&amp;B star Aaliyah has the
highest-charting new release this week on the nation's album sales
chart with "I Care 4 U," a collection of her familiar hits along with
six tracks that were previously unreleased.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old singer and actress died in August 2001 in a plane
crash in the Bahamas. The new album sold 280,000 copies to debut at
No. 3.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Shania Twain's "Up!" lives up to its title by remaining
at the top of the chart for the fourth consecutive week. The album
sold 373,000 copies last week and has totaled 2.19 million copies
since its release last month. With albums by the Dixie Chicks and Tim
McGraw claiming chart positions No. 2 and No. 4, respectively, the
music of the moment is country-leaning.</LD>
<TE>   Other significant debuts: Whitney Houston's "Just Whitney" sold
205,000 copies to open at No. 9, edging R&amp;B vocal group B2K at No.
10.</TE>

<HD>Driven to succeed</HD>
<DH>The Highway Radio group targets a unique audience:
travelers on the roads into Sin City.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ASIDE from brush and billboards, there isn't a whole lot to see on
the 270-mile drive from L.A. to Las Vegas. There's even less to
listen to, at least on the FM dial. It's as much of a wasteland as
the desert once you're out on the I-15 heading into Sin City.
Listeners can press their scan button as often as they like, but it
will only stop on a handful of stations.</LD>
<LD>   Chances are those stations are run by Highway Radio. Thanks to a
complex system of transmitters, repeater signals and remote-uplink
arrays, the tiny Las Vegas radio group broadcasts most of the
consistent FM signals between Nevada's gambling paradise and the
Cajon Pass -- the adult contemporary Highway Stations on 98.1, 98.9
and 99.7 FM, Highway Country on 100.1, 101.5 and 107.3 FM and,
starting Friday, 94.9 and 96.9 FM the Drive, a rock station targeting
the growing market of 25- to 34-year-olds now traveling to Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   That's a lot of frequencies, but Highway Radio has a lot of space
to cover.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike regular stations, which broadcast to specific metropolitan
markets, Highway Radio broadcasts only to the road -- specifically,
the 1,100 highway miles forming the "golden triangle" of visitors to
Vegas: those traveling along Interstate 15 from Southern California,
Interstate 40 from Laughlin, Nev., and Interstates 93 and 95 out of
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have a number of frequencies simultaneously
simulcasting the programs so we can reach the target market as it's
coming into town," said Highway Radio President Kirk Anderson. "It's
a numbers game. The more frequencies I can get out there, the more
geography I can reach, the more ears I can pick up."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, that's about 100,000 listeners a day. With the addition
of the Drive, Highway Radio hopes to pick up 50,000 more.</TE>
<TE>   "About 40% of our target market isn't listening to radio,"
Anderson said. "Our surveys are showing that's young male, young
female."</TE>
<TE>   And those young males and females don't want to listen to the
Simply Red/Mariah Carey adult contemporary of the Highway stations,
the Travis Tritt/Shania Twain mix on Highway Country or the religious
talk, Mexican ranchero music or oldies that come through on the scant
handful of other stations that can be heard in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Most young males and females want to rock, and the Drive will give
them that chance.</TE>
<TE>   Going against the grain of what have become ever more tightly
segmented rock radio formats -- alternative, modern, heritage,
classic -- the Drive will fuse them. In addition to current acts like
Creed, 311 and Hoobastank, the station will also play AC/DC and
Aerosmith.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had to create our own Highway rock format that was broad
enough to appeal to everybody that was interested in rock without
offending anybody," said Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Whether this new format will win the listeners Highway Radio wants
remains to be seen. Unappealing programming isn't the only reason
people stay away from the radio. Many listeners simply prefer
listening to their own CDs, MP3s or tapes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Walkman phenomenon -- 20 years of conditioning by
consumer products for people to find other sources of music
entertainment," said Tony Sanders, senior analyst with Inside Radio
magazine. "People are using radio in a different way than they used
to, more for entertainment than for the companionship you would get
from listening to music with a close friend."</TE>
<TE>   What Highway Radio is gambling on, and what has worked with its
adult contemporary and country formats, is that people tune in for
the information as much as they do for the music.</TE>
<TE>   "So many radio stations are just a jukebox. They play music and
put commercials in and deposit the checks. We have to give listeners
what gives Vegas life," said Anderson. "What makes us unique is the
information about Las Vegas. What we've done out on the highway is
educate, inform and entertain."</TE>
<TE>   All three of Highway Radio's stations are formatted similarly,
playing two to four songs before cutting to commercials, then
traffic, weather, news and entertainment updates.</TE>
<TE>   "First [listeners] want to hear everything's OK, that there's no
accident ahead of them," said Anderson. Beyond that, they want to
know where they should stay and what to do once they get to town.
Part of that information is provided by advertisers, many of which
are hotels and casinos advertising their room rates and live shows. A
lot of it is also provided by the radio station, which employs a
couple of scouts in Vegas to report on "all the really current things
about what's cool."</TE>
<TE>   Highway Radio is unusual in that its stations have a captive
audience for an average of three hours, whereas most stations average
22 to 25 minutes. During that time, many of its listeners are making
critical decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "One hundred percent of my market is going to eat out tonight.
Almost 100% of my market is looking for a show or something to do
right now; 50% are either looking for a room or willing to change
their reservation for a better offer," Anderson said. "Within the
next 45 or 60 minutes, they're going to make a decision."</TE>
<TE>   The sound of Highway Radio isn't that of some rinky-dink operation
broadcasting from the middle of the desert, though it is an odd
hybrid of the professional and the provincial. While the music
selections and announcers sound like any you'd hear in a major market
such as L.A., the advertisements are entirely local. Instead of
Burger King and auto insurance, the commercials are for hotels such
as the Luxor and Circus Circus.</TE>
<TE>   At Barstow Station, a mini-mall off the I-15, most of the people
wandering in the aisles of sunglasses, trinkets and key chains are
oblivious to the radio station upstairs. Right there in plain view,
hovering above them in a glass-encased room on the second floor, is
the on-air studio where a DJ selects pre-programmed songs, gives live
entertainment information and fields phone calls along with traffic
and weather updates.</TE>
<TE>   Mobbed with tour buses and other travelers taking a break on their
way to or from Vegas, the cluster of used train cars that forms
Barstow Station seems an unlikely location for such an operation, but
Highway Radio is perfectly poised to reach the 1.6 million people who
drive through its target market every week. And therein lies its
success.</TE>
<TE>   Highway Radio is the brainchild of Kirk Anderson's father, Howard,
who was vice president of marketing and communications for Howard
Hughes in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   When Hughes asked him to find a cost-efficient means of
advertising to Southern Californians, he pitched the idea of a
drive-in radio market with stations along the I-15 that would reach
inbound customers. Hughes loved the idea but died before it got off
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson ran with it, putting Highway Stations on the air in 1980.
The U.S. was in the midst of a gas embargo, but the concept was
strong enough to survive.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Highway Radio is not only surviving but thriving, a
backhanded beneficiary of Sept. 11, which prompted those within a few
hours of Vegas to drive instead of fly.</TE>
<TE>   "Our air traffic is down about 5% from where it was pre-Sept. 11,"
said Rob Powers, vice president of public relations for the Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority. "It's rebounded, but our drive-in
traffic has increased 11% to 12% since [then]. That would be
predominantly from Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 35 million people who visit Vegas each year, about 10
million of them are from Southern California. Of those, 90% choose to
drive.</TE>
<TE>   Catering to a listenership that exists in transit between major
metropolitan areas separated by endless miles of nothing has been an
enormous success, but it is an anomaly.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few stretches of highway in the U.S. that are so
heavily traveled that lend themselves to this kind of setup," said
Sanders of Inside Radio.</TE>
<TE>   So while Anderson would love to replicate Highway Radio elsewhere
in the country, he said, "This is too unique an entity. We've looked
and looked and looked, and you can't find it."</TE>

<HD>A package for Santa? FedEx goes dashing to the snow</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Either the North Pole moved south or someone at Federal Express got
confused. When David McCreery sent a Christmas note addressed to
Santa Claus at the North Pole, it was delivered to Basalt, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   Why Basalt? McCreery isn't sure. Nor is the spokesperson for
Federal Express or Basalt's town administrator. Perhaps the FedEx
delivery person thought the tiny town of 2,700, with its 6 feet of
annual snowfall, was a suitable substitute for Santa and his crew.
It's certainly more centrally located.</LD>
<LD>   McCreery admits he didn't really expect his package to reach the
big man in red. The 24-year-old Web designer from Michigan was more
interested in using Federal Express's online package-tracking system
to see where his letter would end up.</LD>
<TE>   "I was kind of curious if it would even leave town because for a
while it didn't show up with any tracking information at all," said
McCreery, who mailed the package Tuesday, Dec. 3.</TE>
<TE>   By 6:06 that night, it had at least been picked up. By 11:21, it
arrived in South Bend, Ind. On Wednesday, it surfaced at the Fed Ex
sorting facility in Memphis and was flown to Denver. Finally, on
Thursday, it was delivered to Basalt at 9:58 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   McCreery was quick to post the results of his experiment online.
Within hours, he was hearing from hundreds of people all over the
world -- Finlanders insisting Santa lives in their country, Canadians
suggesting that if he'd sent the same package using the Canadian
postal code HO HO HO, Santa would have written him back.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, McCreery has no plans to try such an experiment again.
"I've been half curious if UPS would do a better job," he said, "but
I'm not in a rush to figure that out."</TE>
<TE>   As for whether Santa got his package, McCreery doesn't know. He
requested a signature, but that was waived.</TE>
<TE>   He might get his answer Christmas morning, if the cookies he
leaves out are replaced with the digital camera that he asked for.</TE>

<HD>Age of blockbusters</HD>
<DH>A LACMA panel discussion on 'Architecture and the Wow
Factor' yielded, instead, some flashes of light, accidental
pleasures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the mid- and late '70s, blockbuster films such as "Jaws" and "Star
Wars" brought an end to the American auteurist cinema that had
fermented in the years before. The same thing, Witold Rybczynski
wrote recently, is happening to architecture, which is more and more
about dazzle and star architects, about structures as tourist
attractions.</LD>
<LD>   Buildings "are built for the ages," wrote the professor of
urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania in an eloquent Atlantic
Monthly article that provoked a recent discussion at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art. "They are not one-night stands, like
blockbuster movies or blockbuster art shows." He called the growing
problem "the Bilbao effect" after Frank Gehry's celebrated Iberian
installment of the Guggenheim Museum, whose flowing sails and
sculpted curves have revived the fortunes of Bilbao, Spain.</LD>
<TE>   It was a fascinating premise for a discussion, especially with the
growing interest in architecture in Los Angeles and with the city's
tradition of unconventional construction. For better or worse, the
ensuing conversation at the museum last week -- which included
Rybczynski; New Yorker architecture critic Paul Goldberger; and
moderator Paul Holdengraber, head of LACMA's Institute for Art and
Cultures -- never quite got there. Or it came, and it went. The
evening veered from topic to topic, some aesthetic, some
architectural, some more broadly cultural, with a combination of
engagement and raggedness.</TE>
<TE>   The event took place only a few days after LACMA's announcement
that it is postponing, perhaps canceling, its ambitious renovation by
Rem Koolhaas for lack of funds as well as on the eve of the opening
of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, a work by Tadao Ando, a great
architect, said Goldberger, "who's not interested in getting into a
war with art."</TE>
<TE>   The event, which had been rescheduled, became more timely, if
substantially less focused: The conversation circled around these two
issues, with questions from the audience concentrating on the work of
Gehry and his Walt Disney Concert Hall under construction in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The mention of the delayed LACMA plan brought, oddly, a
spontaneous burst of clapping -- museum plants, perhaps? -- from the
crowd. Goldberger gave the museum's original buildings a backhanded
compliment: "I used to feel that the only cultural achievement of
this building was to inspire that painting by Ed Ruscha, 'The Los
Angeles County Museum on Fire.' " But over the decades, he said, he'd
"stopped hating" the "problematic, difficult building."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin, with its fractured
Star of David, came in for substantially more praise; Goldberger
called its visual metaphor the rare one that doesn't seem glib and
literal but rather deepens in meaning by eerily shaping its internal
spaces.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA's Bing Theater, capacity 600, was packed with the usual
audience drawn by Holdengraber's institute: a mix of greasy-haired
art kids, suited Westside professionals and mink-clad matrons, plus a
heavy dose of architects, designers and architecture groupies. There
was a strong showing from the city's cultural elite, including Los
Angeles Philharmonic's executive director Deborah Borda;
gazillionaire philanthropist Eli Broad; UCLA Performing Arts Director
David Sefton; CalArts president Steven Lavine (who offered a brief
introduction); and a clutch from KCRW and the Morphosis architectural
firm.</TE>
<TE>   When Goldberger, who is writing a book about rebuilding the World
Trade Center site, called Los Angeles the most creative city in
America "next to New York," he drew hisses from the crowd. It was the
kind of lively audience whose members didn't hesitate to shout
"louder!" when they couldn't hear.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the conversation was familiar fare. It may be time, for
instance, for a moratorium on slams at London's Tate Modern.
Architecture specialists seemed to leave the conversation less
satisfied than the general audiences who had come out to eavesdrop.</TE>
<TE>   As for Bilbao and its effect, Goldberger gave Gehry's museum its
due. "It's as if you had a serious composer writing a modern symphony
that beat out everything on the Billboard charts."</TE>
<TE>   Bilbao's damage, as Rybczynski put it, came from the false
expectations forced on other structures: "You weren't building a
building anymore: You were building a generator, a reviver of
downtown." In most cases, he said, mentioning Philadelphia's new
Verizon Hall, a museum is just a museum, a concert hall just a
concert hall, inhabited only by a small group and open for a specific
part of the day or night.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to conclude something about the future of architecture,
Goldberger mentioned the impact of virtual architecture: "Cyberspace,
threatening to take us away from real space. At the end of the day,
technology will always have its way."</TE>
<TE>   Though they didn't seem to have any root disagreements -- which
might have framed the discussion more firmly -- the two panelists
managed to puncture each other's arguments and to demonstrate, at
least, a contrast in manners: Goldberger witty, physically wiry,
speaking with a Woody Allen speed; Rybczynski stoic, physically
solid, with a heft to his thinking.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, what the evening was about more than anything wasn't
"Architecture and the Wow Factor," the conversation's official title,
but flashes of light, accidental pleasures.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the issues existed more as questions than answers: Should
architects design buildings only in cities they know well? Does a
city need "background architecture" that facilitates street life and
makes the monuments stand out more boldly? Should curators shape
museum architecture the way acousticians do a concert hall? Do
cultures build monuments when they're in decline, the way a
quarreling couple might build a new house to save their ailing
marriage?</TE>
<TE>   Near the night's end, Rybczynski offered a memorable parting shot
as he recalled the days when architecture was less glamorous and an
interest in it was like a secret affair.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something, for instance, your parents didn't know anything
about.... It was like working for the CIA or something."</TE>

<TE>   Punching bag</TE>
<TE>   When a restored brick electric generator on the Thames' South Bank
was opened in 2000 as the Tate Modern, Europe's largest contemporary
art space, the building received mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed the anti-Dome, it was eviscerated by some, and even many of
the forgiving critics said it was an uncomfortable place to view art.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the assessments have actually grown harsher. In an
appearance at LACMA in June, art historian Kirk Varnedoe called the
Tate Modern "a Fascist building worthy of Mussolini."</TE>
<TE>   Said Paul Goldberger last Wednesday: "It was better when it was a
power plant ... utterly and completely joyless."</TE>

<LD>Making you  an omelet  you can't refuse</LD>
<LD>   The Book Soup alcove was, for lack of a better term, mobbed during
a recent signing of Allen Rucker's "The Sopranos Family Cookbook."</LD>
<LD>   That's what you get when you have a hit on your hands. Cheekily
written, with advice penned in the voices of the</LD>
<TE>   HBO series' characters, the book has been Amazon.com's top seller.</TE>
<TE>   The West Hollywood affair drew celebrities -- including Fred
Willard and Ben Stein, and directors Amy Heckerling and John
Patterson, who directed the recent fourth-season finale of "The
Sopranos" -- but was otherwise crowded with fans, friends and family
who drowned out the canned Christmas music with their loud chat and
laughter.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, with its spread of wine, nuts, cheese, crackers and
fruit, the event was less a reading than a cocktail party. As one
attendee deadpanned, "How do you read a cookbook? You need a stove."</TE>
<TE>   There was, however, no stove, just stacks and stacks of books,
which were selling like gelato on a hot summer day in Sicily. One
customer bought six. Comedian Jimmy Kimmel bought three: one for his
mom, another for his Aunt Fran and a third for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I grill," said Kimmel, whose new late-night show "Jimmy Kimmel
Live" premieres next month on ABC. "And I cook all the Italian foods
-- SpaghettiOs, RavioliOs."</TE>
<TE>   As a whole, the event had all the spirit of an Italian family
gathering, if not the pedigree. Rucker, after all, is not from Italy.
Nor was the freely flowing Chardonnay. That was from Sonoma.</TE>

<LD>A soulful voice to bank on</LD>
<LD>   Ask anyone who crowded into the Temple Bar on Dec. 6 to witness
Rhian Benson's showcase, and they'll tell you a new voice soon will
be echoing across the neo-soul/urban-music landscape. Benson's debut
album isn't due until April, but her label, the fledgling Universal
City-based DKG Music, has decided to rush out an EP next month. And
her music, which is drawing comparisons to artists such as Jill
Scott, Sade and Lauryn Hill, is getting top treatment, with James
Poyser and Bob Power on the production team and former Weather Report
bassist Alphonso Johnson as music director. Born in Ghana, West
Africa, and reared in New Delhi, Benson, 25, was a business student
at the London School of Economics and Harvard before concentrating
solely on music. BET has asked Benson to play a show in Ghana. Short
of winning the network's trip-for-two contest, the best place to
sample Benson's work is www.rhianbenson.com.</LD>

<TE>   Heady Halos?</TE>
<TE>   The Halo Friendlies have made great strides this year, releasing
their debut album, "Get Real," on Seattle-based Tooth &amp; Nail Records
and gaining momentum on three tours, the most recent this fall
opening for red-hot Good Charlotte. That connection only solidified
the band's impressive resume -- the Long Beach quartet is managed by
Elyse Rogers of the Dance Hall Crashers, and "Get Real" was produced
by Muffs front woman Kim Shattuck. The album, a collection of taut,
melodic rockers, hasn't received much promotion, but the video for
the catchy single "Sellout" has crept into rotation on MTV2, and the
band earned an appearance on the network's "All Things Rock" show.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward</TE>
<TE>   Two ambitious benefit shows this week in Long Beach benefit the Al
Wooten Jr. Heritage Center in South-Central L.A. On the bill Friday
at DiPiazza's Lounge are John Doe, Peter Case and Keith Morris. Then
on Monday at Alex's Bar, eight local acts -- among them 12 Hour Mary,
Helmut Stein, Gypsy Trash and Just Like Jesus -- take over. ...
Ex-Weezer bassist-Rentals frontman Matt Sharp will stage a benefit
for Honduran immigrant Carlos Ramos, who is suffering from Lou
Gehrig's disease, at 8 p.m. Sunday at the Tamarind Theater in Los
Feliz.</TE>

<LD>   It's no secret I love Fire Marshal Bob. As Hollywood's favorite
hard-nosed quasi-detective, Robert Gladden has earned Clubland's
respect. When he stumbled upon the illegal Bunsen burners outside
CineSpace on the night of the new Hollywood Boulevard club's preview
party, Fire Marshal Bob pitched a fit. It was a last-ditch effort to
serve food, as the kitchen was still a work in progress, but when he
found out the chef was Hollywood vet Monica May (North/Belly), he let
her off the hook, and a swell time was had by all.... This is a
season of fond remembrances, so last week, dozens of Hollywood rock
'n' rollers took part in a cosmic birthday bash for performer Carrie
Hamilton at Goldfingers. Hamilton, a dearly departed friend of the
scene, succumbed to cancer in May.... In February, former Coconut
Teaszer booking director Len Fagan begins booking Wednesdays at
Platinum Live in Studio City. In January, he starts running Mondays
at Hollywood's Club Lingerie. Imagine that: Lingerie could rock
again....</LD>

<DL>WELLINGTON, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>There are movie premieres with star celebs sashaying down red carpets
to the beat of bulb-popping paparazzi and then there are those like
the hometown celebratory unveiling of Peter Jackson's "The Lord of
the Rings: The Two Towers," the second part of the Lord of the Rings
trilogy, that took place Wednesday evening in New Zealand's capital,
(or Wellywood as it is now known), that are events of Super Bowl
proportions.</LD>
<LD>   Grand finale football fever prevailed as 20,000 chanting,
screaming and placard-carrying Wellingtonians and Kiwis from all over
the country descended on a stretch of red carpet in Courtenay Place
in the city's center to watch hometown hero and cast crew and local
celebrities -- including octogenarians Sir Edmund and Lady Hillary --
make their way to the 78-year-old Embassy Theatre cinema, where
Jackson watched his first film.</LD>
<LD>   Youngsters, some dressed in rented hobbit costumes, began to
gather at 6 a.m. and, by midafternoon, every vantage point and
rooftop had been snapped up. Some workplaces in the capital had given
employees time off to attend. Many carried homemade placards
declaring their adoration. "The Oscar's Yours, P.J.," "Take Another
Bow, Mr. Jackson," and "We Love Hobbits."</LD>
<TE>   In the afternoon, a street parade of clowns, movie characters and
marching bands and rock performers entertained the throngs. Atop the
cinema, a huge mystery creature had been erected and wrapped,
unveiled by city Mayor Kerry Pendergast just before the VIPs arrived.
As anticipated, it turned out to be a huge effigy of the head of the
"Two Towers" computer-generated character, Gollum.</TE>
<TE>   The drum rolls started as celebrities began to arrive: hometown
directors Bond Helmer, Lee Tamahori ("Die Another Day") and Vincent
Ward, actor Sam Neil, local sports stars and the cast. The crowd
saved the biggest applause burst for actors who played the hobbit
characters, especially Elijah Wood, and for Jackson, dressed in
open-neck purple shirt and unzipped black jacket.</TE>
<TE>   New Line executive Mark Ordesky, already a popular figure here,
brought the crowd to absolute fever pitch when, edged by Jackson to
the microphone, he made the announcement the crowd had long been
hoping to hear: that Wellington will host the world premiere of the
"The Return of the King," the final installment of the "Rings"
trilogy, next year.</TE>
<TE>   The post-premiere party then moved on to Te Papa Museum, no
special effects spared, where earlier a special Lord of the Rings
exhibit had been launched before heading on an international tour.
"It's lovely to have this opportunity to celebrate the work in a
different capacity as art," said Jackson's Weta Workshop partner,
double Oscar winner Richard Taylor. "It's really important to me
because our work flashes past so quickly on screen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to have the opportunity to show people the detail and
culture of this work ... and let them experience it as art."</TE>

<HD>Where do you buy?</HD>
<DH>Amoeba? Tower? Virgin? It says a lot about you. And how
these stores sell to you says a lot about the struggling music
industry.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Rollins flexes at the edge of the tiny stage as his Rollins
Band attacks a 20-year-old Black Flag tune.</LD>
<LD>   "We're tired of your abuse!" "Try to stop us, it's no use!"</LD>
<LD>   Rollins is glaring, sweating, crouching leonine before the
bombastic sound, and as a fan jumps on stage to share the mic, punk's
hardest softie flicks him back into the mosh pit like a gnat.
Hundreds of heads bounce in unison, some sporting crimson mohawks;
others, in contrast, are close-cropped and gray.</LD>
<TE>   This isn't a club: It's Amoeba Records' sprawling Hollywood store.
Yet the scene seems totally natural, as does the anti-authoritarian
spirit of the song, which the entire store -- including the staff --
takes up at the chorus, fists punching the air: "Rise above! We're
gonna rise above!"</TE>
<TE>   In the war for your ever-shrinking music-buying dollar, Amoeba is
a battlefield, along with Tower Records and the Virgin Megastore.
Hollywood's three iconic record shops are strung along Sunset
Boulevard as the three faces of serious music retail. Each offers
competing visions of rock 'n' roll salvation. More than perhaps any
other stores in the nation, each believes it is the real plug-in to
the heart of pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   These three stores also set the tone for music retail here, and
for retail's relationship with the music and movie industries. And in
many ways, they represent three distinct ways to give the people what
they want. Of the major chain retailers, Tower Sunset is the
original, opening in 1970 and still the home of Hollywood's superstar
rock and pop. Amoeba, on the other hand, functions like a giant
independent, a do-it-yourself palace of punk independence operating
like dozens of local, independently owned stores throughout the
region -- but more massive in scale and with more clout. The Virgin
Megastore at Sunset Plaza, meanwhile, proffers a shiny, international
(but Brit-inflected) take on pop, looking at music less as an art
form with history and more as pure entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   But in a town where entertainment is king and music is one of its
main currencies, choosing a place to buy music is not just a matter
of who has the easiest parking (Virgin takes that one, hands down).
Where you buy your music also to some extent reflects one's beliefs
about the nature of pop culture, who owns it, and how to live it.
It's more than a battle for identity. It's a struggle for the control
of L.A.'s entertainment culture.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Rollins and former Black Flag bandmates Keith Morris
and Chuck Dukowski careen through a dozen tunes in support of a
re-release of their punk club anthems, titled "Rise Above," they've
galvanized the entire cavernous store. Wave after wave of punks and
music freaks peer over the record racks toward the stage in the back
of the main room.</TE>
<TE>   Though Black Flag's songs may have originally been about nothing
deeper than high school lunchroom conflicts, standing there
surrounded by the shrink-wrapped goods that drive a $34-billion
annual industry, deeper connections become clear: Corporations want
to control your music and your live entertainment experience. Black
Flag says fight back. "They hate us, and we hate them," Rollins
shouts in "Six Pack."</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly, he ends with a towering version of "My War." "There's
not that many social environments out there in the world that aren't
bars where you can go listen to music and actually hang out and
talk," says Mark Weinstein, co-founder of Amoeba. "There's a social
connection here that's huge."</TE>
<TE>   We stand in a loading bay, trying to find a few minutes of quiet
as throngs push in to see the Black Flag reunion. Weinstein is a
quick-witted, heavyset 45-year-old man with frizzy brown hair long
enough to make you think he might have been a Berkeley hippie. Which
is exactly where the first of Amoeba's three stores opened in 1990.
The name is a satirical take on what Weinstein and his partners Dave
Prinz and Mike Boyder viewed as the methods of the large chain
stores, which, in amoeba fashion, swallow up mom-and-pop record
stores and replace them with centralized inventories dominated by
major labels. True to the spirit of Berkeley, the trio saw profit in
social connectedness. In fact, Amoeba started out selling mostly used
albums, and today the store still won't promote individual products.</TE>
<TE>   To encourage an atmosphere of discovery, Amoeba doesn't sell its
rack or wall space for ads. So radio hits by Shania Twain or Eminem,
which still make up the bulk of their sales, have to compete equally
on the walls with, say, Echo and the Bunnymen or the Germs or the
Carter Family. No video monitors push the Nick Carter single or Kylie
Minogue. It's an egalitarian approach in which the whole history of
recorded music is represented, not just the newest.</TE>
<TE>   On this Wednesday afternoon, like most days even when there isn't
an in-store performance by alt-rock heroes like Paul Westerberg, the
place is jammed with Hollywood free thinkers. College-age punks in
full regalia mix it up with hipsters in low-slung jeans and band Ts
and reggae fans in rasta hats. But there is also an equal amount of
more educated, somewhat more disheveled-looking lifetime devotees in
their 40s and 50s who, Weinstein argues, have been alienated from
live music venues and chain stores by the consolidation of radio and
music media.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons they come here are obvious: Even in obscure genres
like dub or Japanese noise rock or a section called "Unusually
Experimental Music," there are individual bin cards for scores of
artists who may only have one release. At any one time, the store has
tens of thousands of albums in stock, and they're heavily into used
music, which keeps the prices of even the new albums low.</TE>
<TE>   Amoeba's range is encyclopedic, and you can't really get the feel
for it unless you come to the store. Two friends, BJ and Charlie,
both in their 20s, mull over the pickings. They come here every three
to four weeks and are into the low-priced used CDs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the best parts of L.A.," says BJ. "I totally
thought the town was dead until I found this place."</TE>
<TE>   Amoeba's mix seems to be working. The year-old Hollywood store has
been thriving during one of the biggest slumps in music retail sales
in at least a decade. According to Nielsen Soundscan Inc., which has
tracked shipments of albums since 1991, album sales this year are
down 68 million compared to the same date in 2001, amounting to a 13%
drop worth almost $1 billion. This comes on the back of a 5% drop in
2001, the first decline after five straight years of growth.</TE>
<TE>   Amoeba, which opened here in November 2001, doesn't yet have such
year-to-year comparisons available. But the store grew exponentially
in stock and traffic, according to Weinstein, and the staff went from
135 in 2001 to 185 today. Meanwhile, he said, Amoeba's two other
stores in the Bay Area both saw declines of about 5% in total sales
this year, less than the industry average.</TE>
<TE>   If Amoeba is more about the music than the stars, Tower and Virgin
still believe in the transporting, magical glamour of celebrity, and
no record store has ever represented Hollywood's celebrity culture
like Tower Sunset.</TE>
<TE>   Doing an in-store performance and album signing at the original
Hollywood Tower store is the Sunset Strip equivalent of Oscar night.
Limos pull up and stars walk the red carpet. Spotlights split the
sky.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of well-heeled fans show up and form orderly lines that
snake around the tiny parking lot for hours. That's why KISS came
here last year to kick off its farewell tour. And Ozzy Osbourne and,
just a few weeks ago, his daughter, Kelly. And Elton John, Ricky
Martin, James Brown, Keith Richards, and countless others beginning
in the heyday of what is now '70s classic rock, punk and '80s hair
metal. The biggest stars want this Hollywood connection: Janet
Jackson has it written into her contract that when she releases an
album, she gets the roof display at Tower Sunset.</TE>
<TE>   This is the quality that no other store has, says Jay Smith,
general manager of Tower Sunset: "History. There is something still
very exciting about doing an event on the Sunset Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic slows down. It's a big deal. Virgin can't do that.
Amoeba can't do that. Even though it's changed over the past 10 years
considerably, there's still that shiny luster there."</TE>
<TE>   Smith is a believer in Tower's glamour, a sharp guy whose shaved
head gives him the air of a college swimmer or a fitness guru and who
likes his regular interaction with stars like Elton John. Who
wouldn't?</TE>
<TE>   But he's been with the company since '82 and acknowledges that the
firm,which had taken a downturn even before the industry-wide slump,
may be leaning a bit too hard on its legacy. Historically, they push
the big hits and their prices are usually a touch higher than
discount chains. Inside the store, ads and video screens for all the
hottest right-now artists fill the room with reminders to buy. That,
says Smith, is what his customers want.</TE>
<TE>   "Tower Sunset has a fairly affluent clientele," he says. From his
small office, he motions up into the surrounding Hollywood Hills.
"They are extremely into music; they know what they want. Just prior
to you being here, Neile Adams was in here, the ex-wife of Steve
McQueen, and we were talking about music. That's the caliber of
people who are in here shopping."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, on this Thursday afternoon, there are more staff than
customers, who are older and more focused and bent on their
purchases. It's not a family destination, as other stores try to be.
It's hard to get to, and there's little product for kids. People who
want the bargains can shop Tower's excellent full-service Web site
(www.tower.com).</TE>
<TE>   But Tower Sunset is special because it's now become Old Hollywood.
After a run of corporate expansion from 1996 through 2002 that saw
Tower stores achieve a kind of sameness all over the globe, and the
chain's much-publicized financial troubles, Smith hopes it's going to
go back to its local roots: "We're going to do that, be more
grass-roots, and it needs to be that way," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The Virgin Megastore stands in stark contrast to these other two,
and in some ways its philosophy is the easiest to take -- but only
because it's the least idiosyncratic and most in step with the
malling of America. The Sunset venture was Virgin's first in North
America, opening in 1992, and the company wants to make sure the
store reflects its clean, noncontroversial version of pop life.
Virgin believes in putting on a show. It's the home of bells and
whistles, of popping visuals, of nifty gadgets, of deafening
distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to buy something that's on the radio right now, this
is the place to come," says Rick Browning, from Canterbury, England,
trying out the brand-new Virgin Megaplay kiosk, which reads a barcode
on any album and plays one of 2.4 million 30-second song clips. "They
will have it, and they'll have dozens of it."</TE>
<TE>   As if to drive home his point, great banks of video screens all
over the store flashed a Kylie Minogue concert video, always on the
periphery of vision no matter where you let your eyes rest. "We're
trying to have a bit of fun," says Virgin's Dave Alder, senior vice
president of products and marketing for Southern California, in a
gentle accent from the north of England. "The important thing to us
is generally stimulating the excitement and passion that we've always
believed is synonymous with music and entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Virgin does what it can to make sure its pop really
pops. In true Brit fashion, whose music media famously crown a new
"greatest band of all time" about once a fortnight, Virgin constantly
highlights new releases by bands both known and unknown. It also
supports new music programming by alternative stations like Santa
Monica's KCRW-FM. Video screens blast relentlessly.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Virgin's staff and management also engage in
some juvenile acting out. This Christmas, for example, the "Holiday
Heroes" campaign features customers and employees -- including
company founder Richard Branson -- dressed up in superhero outfits.
It has nothing really to do with selling records. It's just, well,
about having a good time.</TE>
<TE>   Virgin's Sunset store has also made a crucial transition that
neither Tower nor Amoeba has: It's started doing in-store events such
as signings and Q&amp;As that are more tied to booming DVD sales than
flagging CDs. In the past year, the store has put on events with Ian
McKellen for "Lord of the Rings," Baz Luhrmann for "Moulin Rouge" and
an unveiling for a "Scorpion King" billboard that featured a parade
of live camels. The most well-attended event ever at the 10-year-old
store was with Eddie Izzard. The U.K. comedian was kept in the store
for more than five hours by a thousand fans during a recent signing
of the DVD release of his Emmy-winning one-man show, "Dress to Kill."</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a spiral, at the moment," says Alder, referring to music
retail. "There's less money being spent on artists, on marketing and
on creative approaches. That's why we work hard to build an
excitement and belief in music that really should be there."</TE>
<TE>   Picking up on the store's new emphasis on DVDs, customer Christine
Nelson, 23, says she prefers Virgin to Tower and Amoeba, but not for
her music shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a really good DVD and music video selection," she says.
There is a note of reluctance to her answer and she feels compelled
to add: "Well, I buy a lot of vinyl, and they don't have a very good
vinyl selection here." She doesn't do her real music buying here,
just takes advantage of the good parking to go to the Laemmle Sunset
Five theater and to check out Virgin's high-powered visuals.</TE>
<TE>   "I do most of my shopping at Amoeba," she says.</TE>

<TE>   Five things you should know about:</TE>
<TE>   Amoeba</TE>
<TE>   1) Record geeks are mostly male, and most L.A. record-store owners
and managers are men. But Amoeba is co-owned and managed by Jim
Henderson and Karen Pearson, making Pearson one of the few female
owner-managers in town.</TE>
<TE>   2) The store loses money on its full selection of vinyl 45s, but
considers it essential for real collectors.</TE>
<TE>   3) Amoeba supports the programs of Internos Music, a charity
providing music scholarships, instruments and instruction to
underprivileged children, sometimes through the Silverlake
Conservatory of Music, owned by Flea, the bassist for the Red Hot
Chili Peppers.</TE>
<TE>   4) Employees hand out photocopied sheets describing other indie
record stores, their specialties, and contact numbers.</TE>
<TE>   5) Parking underneath the building is cramped and often full.
Neighborhood meters are usually available, but involve a long walk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five things you should know about:</TE>
<TE>   Tower Sunset</TE>
<TE>   1) The original cool Sunset Strip record store. A favorite
shopping spot for celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   2) A leader in the Latin market. A Ricky Martin in-store
performance for "La Vida Loca" in 1998 drew 8,000 fans, and since
then Tower has continued to feature Latin artists.</TE>
<TE>   3) Pioneered the use of original hand-painted versions of album
covers and artists' portraits displayed outside the store. The newest
versions are silk-screened.</TE>
<TE>   4) If you can't find what you want in the small-ish store, the Web
site has a selection that rivals any other (www.tower.com) and, best
of all, you can order any item by phone at 1-800-ASK-TOWER, where a
real live human will talk to you.</TE>
<TE>   5) During in-store performances, traffic gets so snarled that all
events are now coordinated with the city of West Hollywood. And
parking? You're on your own, Jack.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five things you should know about:</TE>
<TE>   Virgin Megastore Sunset</TE>
<TE>   1) Cool holiday promotion: Now through Christmas, spend $50 in the
store, get a coupon book worth $500 -- about $130 good for
merchandise from Virgin, and the rest from partners like Virgin
Mobile phones, Vespa, MTV and others.</TE>
<TE>   2) You could be chosen to be a Virgin Holiday Hero, dressed in a
superhero suit, with red shorts, cape and goggles. Why you would want
to do this is another question.</TE>
<TE>   3) The Virgin Megaplay kiosk is actually really cool. You can
listen to just about any album in the store, though the machine will
only play 30 seconds from each track.</TE>
<TE>   4) Preview selected DVDs. If you've got two hours to burn while
your girlfriend goes to work out at Crunch, just pop upstairs and
watch "Austin Powers in Goldmember." The whole thing.</TE>
<TE>   5) Parking is genius, floor after floor of beautiful parking
spaces under the building. Just going there relieves stress. Get
validated and you walk away unscathed.</TE>

<HD>Eatery may earn chefs a ribbing</HD>
<DH>Abandoning fancy cuisine, partners serve up several tasty
barbecue styles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years as executive chef at 72 Market and later Maple Drive,
Leonard Schwartz has left haute American cuisine behind ... and gone
into the barbecue business in Montrose. Zeke's Smokehouse is a
collaboration among Schwartz, former Reign executive chef Michael
Rosen and Ron and Kirk Gelsinger, father-and-son partners in the
local butcher shop Gelsinger's Meats.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent visit, both chefs were in house. Schwartz sported a
double-breasted chef's jacket while Rosen looked dapper in a white
coat, a meat thermometer tucked in his pocket.</LD>
<LD>   The walls of the sparkling new regional barbecue restaurant and
takeout are covered with black-and-white photos of barbecue
specialists at work around the country.</LD>
<TE>   A board at the back lists what's on offer -- everything from
Memphis baby back ribs or Kansas City spare ribs to Texas beef
brisket and hot links, sold both a la carte or as BBQ platters with a
choice of two sides. If you love pulled pork, Zeke's Carolina pulled
pork sandwich is worth trying.</TE>
<TE>   What sets Zeke's apart is the quality of the meats, the precision
of the cooking and the sides. When you can order made-from-scratch
beans, a classic all-American potato salad and an astonishing,
freshly made applesauce, what's not to like? Not to forget hush
puppies, potato chips made on site and, for those trying to do the
good thing, grilled vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   In a real departure from tradition, instead of Wonder Bread, you
get fresh-baked white bread. This I can live with.</TE>
<TE>   It's not all barbecue, though. Zeke's specialties include a beef
and pork meatloaf, the chili Schwartz served at both 72 Market and
Maple Drive, and for those who can't handle the meat feast, a simple
grilled salmon and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Leave room for dessert. Some of us might make a special trip just
for the hot fudge sundae or the highfalutin' giant brownie with a
fudgy dark center, to say nothing of the IBC root beer float.</TE>
<TE>   The question is not whether this new barbecue concept will
succeed. It's: Where will the next location be?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zeke's Smokehouse</TE>
<TE>   Where: 2209 Honolulu Ave., Montrose.</TE>
<TE>   When: Open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Beer and wine. Parking

<TE>   Cost: Sandwiches $5.95 to $8.95, barbecue platters $7.95 to
$19.95, a la carte and specialties $5.95 to $21.95, sides $4.95;

<HD>Two movies warring in one</HD>
<DH>In '25th Hour,' story and elegy are at odds. Director Spike
Lee's post-Sept. 11 grief is obvious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are two films at war in director Spike Lee's newest feature
"25th Hour," one uninteresting, the other an epic of near-tragic
miscalculation. Edward Norton stars in the first, a story about a
convicted New York City drug dealer, Montgomery Brogan, during his
last day of freedom before beginning a seven-year stretch in prison.
The second, which winds its way through the first like a snake only
to swallow it whole, is a misguided elegy for the city that Monty is
leaving, one in which fallen heroes, ground zero and some vague
notion about the indomitability of the American spirit each plays a
part.</LD>
<LD>   The film opens with a grainy night scene of Monty rescuing a dog.
Snapping and growling and covered with cigarette burns, the mutt has
been tortured, then abandoned at the side of a road, which is where
Monty finds him. "I like this guy," the dealer tells his friend,
Kostya (former NFL star Tony Siragusa), before wrapping the dog in a
blanket and tossing him into the trunk of his muscle car. There are
all sorts of ways to look at a scene like this one, including the
obvious: The guy has a soft spot for lost causes. As the story
unfolds, however, and we spend more time with Monty as he waits out
his last free 24 hours, it becomes evident that the mutt is carrying
an undue load of heavy symbolic baggage.</LD>
<TE>   The dog isn't the only one burdened. Written by David Benioff, who
adapted the screenplay from his well-reviewed novel, "25th Hour" is
about a man who, having abandoned all responsibility -- to his
family, friends and city -- is forced to take stock of his life.
Benioff has preserved the trajectory of Monty's long night, but
what's gone missing in the translation is the character himself. In
the novel, Monty sells dope because he likes what it gives him:
money, a fast car, a beautiful girlfriend and what he calls "sway,"
the power to walk into a store and know you can buy anything. His
mother died when he was a kid, but Benioff doesn't pretend that
explains why he sells heroin in playgrounds. Monty sells dope because
he's greedy and amoral; he sells it because he can.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't until the final few pages of the book that Monty grasps
the full measure of his choices. By then, all of his family and
friends have had their say about him, as has the author, who
throughout keeps a cool distance from the character. This distance
distinguishes Benioff's modest character study but also makes it
tough for Lee to get a bead on Monty. We don't like moral ambivalence
in our movies, and unsympathetic characters are always trickier to
put on screen than between the pages of the novel. Ambivalence has
never been one of Lee's problems -- or his strengths. As a filmmaker,
he loves as fiercely as he hates, but he's never indicated much
interest in exploring the vast gray zone in between, where real
people live.</TE>
<TE>   Lee seems stumped by Monty, or maybe he doesn't care. Presented
with a character with a hole where his conscience should be, Lee
makes the calamitous mistake of connecting Monty with Sept. 11,
imbuing the character with tragedy by proxy. After the opening scene,
the film flashes forward to the present, with Monty sitting with his
dog on the Brooklyn promenade and staring toward lower Manhattan.
When Monty visits the bar owned by his father (Brian Cox), a
photograph of a fallen firefighter stares out from a wall; later,
when two of Monty's oldest friends, Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman)
and Slaughtery (Barry Pepper), talk about him, they're framed against
a window looking over ground zero. Even if you don't know the
geography, you get the picture; ever the didact, Lee makes sure of
it.</TE>
<TE>   As "25th Hour" drags on, accompanied by the dirge-like wailing of
Terence Blanchard's score, the films two halves grow further apart.
There's the one in which Monty broods about New York, licking his
wounds, enduring a farewell meal with his dad and wondering if the
woman with whom he's shared his life, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson),
tipped off the cops. In the other story, there is simply the city
with its dusty air and memorials, its tattered flags and anguish.
This desperate, melancholic vision clenches the heart but makes no
sense in the context of the story. You don't doubt Lee's grief about
what happened to his city, but this is passion deployed in a vacuum.
Monty's pity remains securely self-directed throughout; the dealer
does nothing, has done nothing, to earn a stake in such tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   As a performer, Norton always seems ready to pounce even when
slouched on a sofa, but he's given little to grab hold of here. He
signals Monty's anger and fear, but the emotions never deepen into
self-recognition because the character hasn't been designed for
consciousness. It says something about Lee's commitment to the
character and to the material overall that Monty is never more alive,
and more persuasive, than during a hate-filled harangue toward New
York's multihued inhabitants. The rest of the performances are
professional, no more, although mention must be made of Anna Paquin,
who has the unfortunate task of playing one of Jacob's students, a
repellent creature whom Lee films with all the affection he would
bestow on cockroach.</TE>

<KH>My Favorite Weekend: Rasta Thomas</KH>
<HD>Maximizing his fun time, using the buddy system</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A third-degree black belt at the age of 9, Rasta Thomas nonetheless
misbehaved in martial arts classes. His punishment: ballet classes.
The result: He was the first American to join the Kirov Ballet in
Russia and is now the star of "Pearl," Debbie Allen's dance remake of
"Snow White." His role? He plays Charm, of course.</LD>
<LD>   Monday, Monday</LD>
<LD>   The only real day off I have is Monday, when the theater is dark.
Usually that's when my best friend, Oscar Hawkins, a performer in
Cirque du Soleil's Mystere, drives in from Las Vegas. He's working on
a CD, so we'll go to the recording studio and lay down some tracks
and have some fun doing that. I flow a little bit -- do some vocals,
you know, trying to expand the horizons.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meals and movie magic</TE>
<TE>   Then we'll have some lunch, someplace like Le Petit Four. One time
we went to the Mann Village to catch a movie -- "Harry Potter." The
theater was right across from California Pizza Kitchen, so just
before the movie, we went in and had some key lime pie -- their key
lime is major.</TE>
<TE>   We went to the Gap, went to the record shop -- Oscar bought Missy
Elliot's new CD. I got Linkin Park. And then we caught up with
another friend who lives in Westwood and we went to Eurochow to have
drinks and just hang out.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of nights ago, I went to Barnie's Beanery, that's pretty
good. It's got karaoke and my friend Allison Porter was hosting, so
that was fun. But on most of my free time I like to go see movies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A time to laugh</TE>
<TE>   I went to the Ha Ha Cafe last night after the performance. Buddy
Lewis, one of my "Pearl" co-stars, hosts there every Wednesday night.
I love to laugh. Well, one night before the show opened, Buddy tells
me Tommy Davidson is hosting a night at the Platinum Live. Tommy is
from Maryland, like me.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody was there that night: Cedric the Entertainer, Jamie Foxx
and Brian McKnight. They brought Brian up and he sang, and all of the
women went googoo, gaga. But I can't go out every night now that the
show has started. But there's always Mondays.</TE>

<LD>Santa has many helpers during the holiday season, but those who work
retail may be better described as saints. Keeping a toy store in
shape can be especially challenging as mothers jockey their strollers
for position and hordes of screaming, excitable children attempt to
climb the shelves. Mellisa Fernandez, general manager of FAO Schwarz
at the Grove, lets us in on her life.</LD>
<LD>   Tough stuff</LD>
<LD>   The store's theme song, "Welcome to our world of toys!" sung by a
children's choir, which plays constantly. "You learn to drown it out,
to tell the truth. Sometimes you start to sing it. What's funny is
that you hear customers singing that song also."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toy box woes</TE>
<TE>   After closing, it can take as long as an hour and a half to get
the place in shape for the following morning. At other times of year,
it's half an hour. "It's pretty messy," Fernandez says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The soft touch</TE>

<HD>Mahogany in blues: confident and swinging</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Mahogany started his career as an instrumentalist, playing
clarinet and baritone saxophone. Although he had switched to singing
by the time he was out of college, his strengths as a singer are
firmly rooted in his background as a horn player.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday at the Jazz Bakery, Mahogany's opening set revealed
both the pluses and the minuses implicit in the duality of his
musical training. In the vocal area of that training, there's never
been any question about the fact that he has a sweet-toned voice, a
useful range and an articulate delivery.</LD>
<LD>   But those qualities alone are not sufficient in jazz singing.
Equally important is the ability to tell a story, to deliver lyrics
in a convincing fashion. And the few ballads Mahogany chose to
present -- "Our Love Is Here to Stay" and "My Romance" among them --
were uneven at best. Occasional effective phrases were too often
surpassed by bigger-than-life high notes and shaky intonation.</LD>
<TE>   Mahogany's instrumental background served him far better when he
turned to the blues. On numbers such as "All Blues" and "Route 66" he
seemed a different singer -- confident, musical, imaginative and
swinging. And in duets with bassist John B. Williams and drummer
Ralph Penland, he was even better, matching their improvised phrases
with sterling inventiveness of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Those moments in the set, further enhanced by Corey Allen's
supportive piano and the gutsy, blues-drenched guitar of Grant
Geissman, affirmed some of the critical accolades Mahogany has
received, while underscoring his need to find similarly appealing
expressiveness in other areas of his art.</TE>

<HD>Sentimental shopper</HD>
<DH>Crowds, sales, parking lot jams: These are seasonal
traditions to savor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Thomas</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was raised on a strict regimen of holiday cheer -- elaborate
tree-trimming sessions sweetened with mulled wine, figgy pudding and
heavy rotations of Handel's "Messiah."</LD>
<LD>   But the mid-20s have proved a rough era for this holiday junkie,
and I'll stop at nothing to rekindle those childhood memories. Which
is why every year around this time, I make a pilgrimage to the malls
of our fine city and throw myself headlong into an ice blended froth
of yuletide commerce.</LD>
<LD>   You can keep your online shopping and your electronic wish lists.
Give me crowded elevators, red tag sales and vast Escher-esque
parking structures. Christmas is a time to hit the streets, not to
sit in bed with your laptop. Our car culture is a big enough
impediment to social interaction. Besides, the three-tiered flow of
foot traffic in the Beverly Center is the closest thing to a Fifth
Avenue street scene you're going to get.</LD>
<TE>   But the mall is more than just a place to charge and be charged.
It vigilantly tends the Christmas flame, placing ornate decorations
around every corner and erecting tannenbaums in strategic locations.
Windows are dressed to the nines in reds, whites and greens, while
modern-day variations on classic carols spin inside CD players. If
you find yourself running low, chances are a lengthy trip to the mall
will imbue you with enough Christmas to propel you through New Year's
and into Twelfth Night.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, I am a bit biased. I grew up in these malls. Before
Brand Boulevard got its retail make-over, trips to Glendale in early
December meant three things: a hot dog on a stick, an Orange Julius
and a trunk full of Galleria shopping bags, many of which contained
presents that belonged to me.</TE>
<TE>   Love it or hate it, malling was the most efficient way to shop,
and it still is.</TE>
<TE>   Awkward, preemptive phone interrogations to help take the
guesswork out of gift giving will be a thing of the past once you
begin taking group field trips to shopping centers. One-click Web
jockeys take note, for there is no better way to satisfy the urge for
instant gratification than this. While you're busy sucking down a
peppermint latte on Level 1, a significant other is on Level 3 buying
those leather gloves you were coveting not 15 minutes earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most look down their noses at this activity, ranting about
long lines, traffic and everyone's favorite scapegoat: the people.
The high concentration of bodies in one building can crack the will
of the most experienced shopper. So why not use it to your advantage?</TE>
<TE>   Precious vacation time is eaten up attending catch-up parties
thrown by people who feel compelled to sneak in a little year-end
face time after effectively blowing you off for the last 325 days.
These gatherings are usually uncomfortable and hardly festive.
Instead, visit them at the Sherman Oaks Galleria or Century City's
expansive outdoor bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   They will be there, merchandise in hand. And you'll be ready.
Calm, collected and brimming with merriment; armed with just enough
anecdotes to fuel a five-minute "how ya been" before disappearing
into Rizzoli for a periodical. The mall codifies the smells and
sights of the season, with a few familiar faces thrown in for good
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Just remember the one cardinal rule: No matter what the cost,
always valet-park.</TE>

<LD>Magoo, you've done it again</LD>
<LD>   The beloved animated TV special "Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol" has
been reissued 40 years after it first aired on NBC ($10 for VHS; $15
for DVD, Classic Media). This surprisingly straightforward musical
version of the Charles Dickens story features the nearsighted Mr.
Magoo (voiced by Jim Backus) starring in a Broadway production of the
tale. It's been beautifully restored and digitally remastered, and
the DVD includes the rare short "Mr. Magoo Meets Gerald McBoing
Boing," a history of Mr. Magoo in television and film.</LD>

<TE>   'Rudolph' shines</TE>
<TE>   The venerable CBS special "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" ($10
for VHS, $20 for DVD, Classic Media) premiered in 1964 and continues
to air regularly. The animated delight features narration by Burl
Ives, the Johnny Marks title tune and Ives' version of "Have a Holly
Jolly Christmas." The DVD includes an interview with "Rudolph"
producer Arthur Rankin, the song "Fame and Fortune," the original TV
promo, a trivia game and the Spanish-language version.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A 'Frosty' pair</TE>
<TE>   The 1969 CBS special "Frosty the Snowman," narrated by Jimmy
Durante, is coupled with its 1995 sequel, "Frosty Returns," featuring
the voice of John Goodman ($10 for VHS, $20 for DVD, Classic). The
DVD includes a different interview with Rankin, an animated pencil
test from "Frosty the Snowman," an interactive puzzle and
Spanish-language versions of both features.</TE>

<HD>'Aladdin' strives for a little magic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Niles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few theme-park shows rise above the level of mediocre summer stock
theater. Ten, maybe 15 minutes of poorly sung or lip-synced pop or
show tunes, padded with some awkward dialogue, and that's it. But a
new musical based on Disney's "Aladdin" at California Adventure is
raising the standard for theme park entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   This "Aladdin" packs six songs -- five from the movie and one
original tune -- into a lively 40-minute show at the park's
2,000-seat Hyperion Theater. Whispers from Disney employees suggest
that the company hopes this production will follow "Beauty and the
Beast" and "The Lion King" to Broadway some day.</LD>
<LD>   It's not ready. This show lacks the splendor of "Beauty and the
Beast" and the innovation of "The Lion King." Nor does it capture the
frenetic enthusiasm of the animated original. And the warmth of a
live orchestra would have taken a harsh edge off this over-amplified
production. Yet despite its shortcomings, "Aladdin" rises far above
any other musical production at a local theme park.</LD>
<TE>   The show follows the plot of the movie, with a few cuts -- notably
two beloved sidekicks, Abu the monkey and Rajah the tiger. The
abbreviated plot leads to a few awkward transitions, including a
clumsy introduction for the heroine, Princess Jasmine.</TE>
<TE>   Most problematic, though, is the show's treatment of the Genie. It
is unreasonable to expect any actor to match Robin Williams' bravura
performance in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, for "Aladdin" to work, the character of the Genie
must come across as larger than life. The actor in that role on Dec.
8 (during opening weekend) played gamely, eliciting several laughs
from the audience, but the cavernous hall swallowed much of his
performance. This character demands the production and design
creativity that brought a savanna of animals to life in "The Lion
King." But "Aladdin" never offers anything so visionary.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, after actors playing Aladdin and Jasmine climbed aboard
their magic carpet for the show's romantic ballad, the two
disappeared below stage level and were replaced by a small model
dragged across a backdrop -- a cheap effect that elicited derisive
guffaws. Fortunately, the model was quickly replaced with a full-size
carpet, carrying Aladdin and Jasmine into and above the audience.
Gasps of delight and cheers replaced the laughter, and the scene was
saved -- except for those sharp-eyed patrons who noticed that the
Aladdin on the carpet was an Asian actor, while the Aladdin who had
been on stage was white. Once again, clumsy or thoughtless direction
undermines the show.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the hard-working performers and the delightful source
material overcome the production's limited vision. The Genie and a
cleverly played magic carpet get their share of laughs. Rousing songs
from the movie, including "Prince Ali," never fail to entertain. And
whenever someone hops on that carpet, the production literally soars.</TE>
<TE>   The full house that watched the show left entertained, though not
quite wowed. With a few tweaks, this show could grow into a
much-needed reason to buy a ticket for California Adventure.</TE>

<LD>A two-headed dragon, a four-headed monster from Greek mythology, a
stalwart knight, a princess in distress: Giant puppets, ranging from
3 to 10 feet tall, are the highlight of the "Ivar Holiday Puppet
Festival," today at 7 p.m. at the New Ivar Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The large-scale puppets, crafted by students at Taft and Sylmar
high schools, are the stars of a medieval-style fairy tale and a
15-minute version of "The Odyssey" -- performed in black light. Also
on tap are professional puppeteers who will present their own
vignettes using puppets of various styles.</LD>
<LD>   This colorful event is the culmination of a pioneer program called
"Puppet Power" involving Taft and Sylmar art and English studies
departments. Students fashioned their fanciful large-scale puppet
creations to enact original works based on literature.</LD>
<TE>   Hosted by the LA Arts Intersection collective of performing and
visual artists, the program is presented by the Ivar-based California
Youth Theatre and the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. Stick
around after the show for a reception with the student and
professional puppeteers in the Ivar's Brick Box space, where the big
puppets will be on display for an up-close look.</TE>
<TE>   "Ivar Holiday Puppet Festival," the New Ivar Theatre, 1605 N. Ivar
Ave., Hollywood. Tonight, 7. $5. (323) 960-4386.</TE>

<HD>'02 Lounge showcases hits and swagger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dean Kuipers</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From its humble beginnings as a Lower East Side open-mike night
highlighting the poetry and messages of hip-hop's best MCs, Lyricist
Lounge has grown into three national tours, two CD releases and two
seasons as an MTV sketch comedy series.</LD>
<LD>   But this year's heavyweight lineup, anchored by Scarface, Erick
Sermon (of the legendary NYC crew EPMD) and Wu Tang's Killah Priest,
seemed to rely too much on greatest hits and not showcase as much new
talent -- or especially remarkable lyrics -- as the name has come to
promise.</LD>
<LD>   Not to take anything away from the headliners during Tuesday's
stop at the House of Blues: Scarface took the stage alone with his
DJ, and their usual bombast had the less-than-capacity crowd
partying. Sermon and his partners in the Def Squad, Keith Murray and
Redman, were having the most fun, but their set gave way in the
middle to a gratuitous tribute to fallen rappers, including Notorious
B.I.G. and 2Pac.</LD>
<TE>   A high note came from newcomer Poverty, a gritty bantam rapper
who, he says, was living in a Massachusetts homeless shelter when
discovered by ArtistDirect Records President Ted Fields. "I'm
hungry!" he cried, repeating over and over an appeal for support that
made it perfectly clear that even his heartfelt "The Real Die Young"
wasn't describing a glaring social injustice as much as a raw lust
for cash. A dose of positive hip-hop would have helped balance this
show's bad case of young and baseless swagger.</TE>

<LD>A Wilde Holiday: Returning for a second year, this evening of
storytelling, poetry and music fashioned around three 1888 fairy
tales by Oscar Wilde is as fresh and simple as a Christmas tree
before the tinsel goes on. The stories are bound together with poems
by Lewis Carroll, Willa Cather, Christina Rossetti and May Sarton,
with luminous music by Laura Karpman. Performers slip nimbly between
portrayals of animals, plants and people with happy disregard for
actual species, gender or age. It's just actors, and words --
beautiful ones.</LD>

<HD>Gabriel's growth eludes critic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Hilburn's review of Peter Gabriel's live performance ("Gabriel
Has Zeal but 'Up' Lacks Appeal," Dec. 12) seemed less a review of the
show than an opportunity to pillory the album "Up" and, in the
process, demonstrate a facile understanding of the music on that
disc.</LD>
<LD>   I attended the Gabriel show at the Staples Center last week and
thoroughly enjoyed the performance and the music (much of which was
from "Up"). The only thing I didn't enjoy was how a good part of the
audience spent so much time shuttling back and forth between their
seats and the plethora of snack bars in the building. I had the
impression that, for these people, the concert wasn't an artistic
event but rather like spending an evening watching TV, where their
attention falls neatly into 12-minute act breaks punctuated by trips
to the refrigerator.</LD>
<LD>   What made me think of Hilburn and his comments about the "Up"
material was how the transient members of the audience only seemed
engaged when Gabriel and company performed selections from "So." I'm
aware that Hilburn's career has spanned a great number of years and
that he has some familiarity with Gabriel's work. That makes his take
on "Up" all the more surprising. His thesis seems to be that Gabriel
should return to the more hook-oriented brand of music that permeated
"So."</LD>
<TE>   That opinion demonstrates either a sad lack of understanding of
Gabriel's music and its evolution or simply stands as a statement of
aesthetic shallowness on Hilburn's part. Should the latter be true,
then he'd likely be happier immersing himself in the later works of
Paul McCartney and Sting ... or maybe even Britney Spears.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Brooks</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reading Robert Hilburn's review of Peter Gabriel's concert at the
Arrowhead Pond really had me wondering if we saw the same show. I saw
an amazing performance that I won't soon forget. He saw a concert
bogged down by the "stiff, lifeless tone of much of Gabriel's latest
album." I personally find Gabriel's new album enthralling and very
thought-provoking. Then again, I am not a middle-aged critic trying
hard to maintain my credibility by raving about Eminem as if he were
God's gift to music. Hilburn may feel that Gabriel's latest work is
"a bit too obvious," but I guess writing rant after vicious rant
about one's mother is "more inventive musically and more convincing
thematically" than Gabriel's latest work. If the critic would act his
age, he may find much to relate to in Gabriel's newest album.</TE>

<TE>   Your interesting article was brought to my attention from
customers who frequent our store and sometimes just stop by to see my
windows. A few of them called to let me know that Out of the Closet's
window was included in your "Stop and Stare" list of holiday
displays.</TE>
<TE>   Just to let you know, I not only dress the windows, but I only use
items donated to the store. I have no budget and do only what I can
with what is in the store.</TE>

<TE>   Littlefoot the apatosaurus and the rest of the "Land Before Time"
kid dinosaur pals return in the ninth release of this deservedly
successful, cut-above animated series. This time around, Littlefoot
befriends a perky opthalmosaurus named Mo after the dolphin-like
dinosaur is washed into the Great Valley lake by a tremendous flood.
Littlefoot and friends help Mo return to the "Big Water" -- the ocean
-- despite the unwelcome attentions of a giant "sharp tooth swimmer"
and a land-altering "earth shake."</TE>
<TE>   The perils may be too intense for the smallest viewers if Mom and
Dad aren't nearby for comfort. But fun, friendship and gentle caring
are what this series is all about, and bouncy humor and happy endings
are guaranteed.</TE>

<HD>Showtime shifts strategy</HD>
<DH>Channel moves toward series; TV movies will take a hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not HBO. It's Showtime.</LD>
<LD>   Showtime, having chafed at living in the shadow of that other pay
TV service, is revising its programming strategy, funneling more
resources into series while slashing its output of original movies --
another blow to the made-for-TV movie industry.</LD>
<LD>   After once seeking to stand apart by offering what was billed as
"a new movie every week," Showtime now admits the sheer volume of
that approach may have been counterproductive. Instead, the pay
service will try to extend the relative success it has enjoyed with
niche-oriented programs, such as the gay serial "Queer as Folk" and
African American family drama "Soul Food." New series planned include
a show with magician-comics Penn &amp; Teller and the ensemble drama
"Earthlings," centering on a group of lesbian friends in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   By doing so, Showtime will adhere to a formula HBO adopted years
ago that led to such channel-defining shows as "The Sopranos" and
"Sex and the City." One TV agent said Showtime suffers from "Avis
syndrome," referring to the No. 2 rental-car company.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Offsay, the network's president of programming, said the
challenge is to "make people feel like they're missing something if
they don't have Showtime," adding in regard to HBO, "Our job is to
convince people that we've got stuff that's worth watching, also."</TE>
<TE>   Showtime has determined that original series represent the best
way to achieve that goal -- especially with feature films, once pay
TV's main attraction, available on video, DVD and pay-per-view before
reaching the channel.</TE>
<TE>   To shift its emphasis toward series, Showtime is cutting its TV
movie production to 14 for the coming year, down from three times
that many just a few years ago. "Something had to give somewhere,"
Offsay said, adding that the overall programming budget would still
increase.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that has to do with the fact that Showtime intends to
spend $6 million to $7 million on the movies it does make -- as
opposed to the $4-million productions that were being churned out --
and allocate more for marketing them. HBO has attempted to fill a
void between blockbuster features and TV with bigger-budgeted movies,
such as the recent "Path to War," which cost $17 million.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Paulson, who has produced more than a dozen Showtime films,
said he welcomed Showtime's focus on fewer but bigger projects.</TE>
<TE>   "It raises the bar for us as producers," he said. "They want to
take chances. Everything is so cluttered, you sort of have to do that
to get attention."</TE>
<TE>   The shift will nevertheless exact a toll on writers, actors,
producers and directors who have worked on Showtime films -- though
not necessarily local technical employees, since most of its
production is done in Canada to lower costs.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, NBC and ABC have cut back TV movie orders as well, offset
only in part by an increase in films for smaller cable channels such
as ESPN and VH1. "It's not a good time to be a TV movie producer,"
Offsay said.</TE>

<HD>An arresting performance</HD>
<DH>Jason Patric gives one of his signature intense and
truthful portrayals in his latest film, the brutal, slick 'Narc.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the sort of movie that slaps you awake, that grabs you by the
shoulders and shakes you -- hard. "Narc's" opening scene is a barrage
of kinetic brutality that disturbs not so much with its violence as
with its honesty. In "Narc," murder is painfully real, slow and messy
and committed on sad and savage impulse.</LD>
<LD>   Stylistically slick, with photography that moves from sandpaper
grittiness to blue-cold contrast, Joe Carnahan's second feature (his
first was the $7,000 independent "Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane")
flaunts enough MTV-derived flash to hold the eye, but at its heart
it's a character study in the vein of the '70s cop drama, where the
story is less about the crime committed than the lives of those it
touches. The film's narrative follows two undercover narcotics cops
(Ray Liotta and Jason Patric) struggling to find the murderer of a
fellow officer and, with him, their own redemption.</LD>
<TE>   "Narc" is exactly the sort of movie in which one would expect to
find Jason Patric, who has made brooding intensity and wounded
vulnerability his specialty. When Patric acts, it can be like the
shattering of glass, a process that simultaneously reveals, reflects
and cuts us deep. For his first major screen role, in 1987's "The
Lost Boys," Patric tackled the role of a tormented young vampire with
a veracity that lifted the film up from standard teen horror flick to
a surprisingly poignant study in adolescent alienation. Immediately
hailed by the press as one of the best young actors of his
generation, Patric was hefted upon the media's shoulders and paraded
about as "the next big thing." It was a title he would quickly
relinquish, opting instead for a career built from carefully made
choices and complete and total commitment to his roles.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I've taken a very unconventional path," admits Patric over
breakfast at a Santa Monica hotel. "I've had opportunities since a
very young age to take the standard walk in someone else's 'movie
star' shoes, but I didn't want that. I just wanted to be in movies
that I wanted see." These movies have included the modern-day noir
"After Dark, My Sweet," 1991's "Rush" and Neil La Bute's "Your
Friends &amp; Neighbors," the latter of which Patric also produced.</TE>
<TE>   "I put the whole thing together from scratch," Patric says of his
experience on the film. "I brought Neil out to Hollywood, to a lot of
people's dismay, I think. From the first time I shook his hand to the
time we were filming, I think took five months. It was just great to
be involved like that. I picked the actors that I wanted to work
with, created the rehearsal period I wanted, the shooting days,
everything. And I think it validated a lot of the ideas that I had
and alleviated a lot of the frustrations I'd dealt with in the past.
It was completely fulfilling. After that I didn't want to jump into
something that wasn't amazing, so a long time went by in the
process." It was five years, to be exact, before Patric found "Narc"
and with it a role he felt worth his time and his energy.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made two movies in the last half decade, which is career
death," says Patric unapologetically, "but I'd rather have two movies
like this than a lot of filler." Patric's discernment may be risky
for business, but it certainly hasn't detracted from his talent.</TE>
<TE>   Onscreen he possesses a rare naturalness, an authenticity of
movement, which is enhanced by his physicality. In person, as on
film, he has strong, compact grace and the keen alertness of a cat
about to pounce. Even when Patric is playing strung out and
world-weary (as he does fairly often), there is always something
electric just under the surface and this is the bit of himself Patric
(thankfully) can't seem to disguise.</TE>
<TE>   "I always try to attack my roles more like an athlete," Patric
explains. "If you can achieve real behavior in a film, people relate
to it on their own primal level. They recognize it innately and it
affects them. For 'Narc,' Carnahan and I talked about wanting to see
the character's hands, the sensuality of those hands holding his baby
and then the painful dichotomy of those hands doing other things.
Movies are also the only time where you get to see people alone. In
'Narc,' you see this man alone and you see the way he moves when he's
alone and there's something poignant in that."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that Patric claims he considered quitting acting
before taking on his role in "Narc" -- "I just wasn't finding it to
be satisfying" -- it's statements like the one above that illustrate
his commitment. Patric is simply not an actor (nor person) willing to
give himself over to complacency.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think it's possible to do something that means something
to people," he says firmly. "Film is the only art that manifests
itself in the human form. You see a representation of yourself on the
screen and that's why, as an actor, trying to achieve real behavior
is so important, more important than 'performance,' more important
than some sort of identity or shtick. The goal should be to erase the
name, to have the audience connect with the film and forget about the
actor. Just like Terry Malloy 50 years ago in the back of that cab
has nothing to do with Marlon Brando. People relate to 'On the
Waterfront' because everybody has thought at one point, 'I could have
been somebody.' And that's why, 50 years later, that moment is just
as powerful."</TE>

<HD>Solace sought, and offered, by Tori Amos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The old saying goes that if you want to get someone's attention,
whisper. But when singer-pianist Tori Amos tried that at the
Universal Amphitheatre on Tuesday, she couldn't be heard above the
capacity crowd's shouts of admiration.</LD>
<LD>   Amos, who offered only a few between-song words throughout the two
hours and 15 minutes, appeared to be conserving her voice, which
sounded slightly ragged the first time she spoke.</LD>
<LD>   Her singing, however, was typically powerhouse, shifting easily
from operatic to breathily intimate to guttural and growling. Indeed,
even when hushed it commanded attention, so it's not surprising that
she ended up singing an explanation of why she was performing under a
"Roadside Cafe" sign during a brief solo-piano turn.</LD>
<TE>   That setting tied into the concept of Amos' current album,
"Scarlet's Walk," which follows its title character through a journey
of discovery. Such numbers as the sprawling, propulsive "A Sorta
Fairytale" and the wistful ballad "I Can't See New York" represent
the sort of epic yet personal exploration that is her trademark and
which inspires the irrepressible devotion of those who find her music
both soothing and cathartic.</TE>
<TE>   When she arrived in 1991 with "Little Earthquakes," that sense of
comforting fury came from Amos' ability to angrily confront trauma
and affirm her survival. "Scarlet's Walk" allows for anger but
focuses more on seeking solace, though the lush music is still
suffused with melancholy.</TE>
<TE>   Planted as usual between her shiny black Bosendorfer piano and a
pair of stacked keyboards, Amos was at times positively voracious,
writhing on the bench and rocking to the sensual flow of new songs
and older material.</TE>
<TE>   Bassist Jon Evans and drummer Matt Chamberlain provided essential
grooves and agile beats that fleshed out the songs and emphasized the
tunes' erotic rhythm, making them more accessible to the casual fan
or new listener. Although their contributions were key, the extra
color and texture ultimately didn't counteract the set's pervasive
pensiveness, which proved wearying even to some of the faithful.</TE>

<KH>A NIGHT AT BAR COPA</KH>
<HD>'One nation, under one groove'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind the iron gate on Main Street in Santa Monica is a tiny club
with a different flavor, a dark and shadowy red space where L.A.'s
Eastside and Westside intersect for a rare energetic social
experience. Open for five months, the underground Bar Copa is easy to
miss. There's no sign outside, no industry advertising, nothing to
attract attention except for the warmth inside, especially on
Tuesdays.</LD>
<LD>   The club's "Big Up" night draws an ethnic and geographically
diverse crowd, pumped up to party late on a school night with its
young, charismatic promoter Gaia, and the soulful sounds of DJ Daz.</LD>
<LD>   "When you come in here, there is a very relaxing vibe," says Gaia,
25. "It has a very gritty, raw element to it. I don't like anything
homogenous because that's just not how the world really is. I want it
to be one nation under one groove."</LD>
<TE>   The groove, thanks to veteran DJ Daz, ranges from classic hip-hop
to soulful house to neoclassical soul, funk and dance hall. "I like
the fact that we can play diverse music for a diverse crowd," says
the 30-year-old DJ, who has been spinning in L.A. for 12 years. "The
people who come here know they will either get something they haven't
heard in a very long time or something they've never heard before."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the bar's sexy pull is its cave-like darkness (you
actually squint when you walk outside in the dead of the night) and
red-tinted wooden walls.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Ashley Joyce, also a partner in the Room in Hollywood and
the Room in Santa Monica, said the look and name of the 120-capacity
bar was inspired by a trip he took to the Riviera Hotel in Havana.
Two blocks north of the Venice border, Bar Copa is in the space known
for years as the Pink, and most recently as the Mix.</TE>
<TE>   "The music is not secondary here," said the British-born Joyce,
who lives in Topanga Canyon. "Daz is where the whole night starts."</TE>
<TE>   Daz, the resident DJ at the Room in Santa Monica on Fridays and at
Chocolate Bar on Melrose Avenue on Saturdays, turned a hobby into a
career when he was 18. His biggest influences include James Brown,
Chaka Khan and Bill Withers.</TE>
<TE>   When Bar Copa manager Kent Howard met Gaia at an album release
party, he knew she was the promotional ingredient to best complement
Daz's musical style. "Daz is my DJ. I just love the eclectic music
that he plays," said Gaia, a film student at Cal State L.A. "It goes
with the eclectic people I can bring in."</TE>
<TE>   The twentysomething and thirtysomething crowd shows up around
midnight and spends more time dancing and mingling than at the bar.</TE>
<TE>   But as welcoming as it feels, Copa is not for everybody, says its
manager. "We keep it like a diamond in the rough," Howard said. "If
you don't know about the place, then you don't know the place. People
walk out here on the street and see this cheesy, college Main Street
atmosphere, and then they come in here and it's nothing but cool and
real. The frat boys don't get it, but other people come in here and
feel the groove and come back."</TE>

<HD>Good as spun gold</HD>
<DH>Jamaican Gold's reggae scene has become an empire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Baz Dreisinger</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angelenos know where to find Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Ethiopia,
and Little Armenia. But Little Jamaica? In the right place (the House
of Blues), at the right time (every Sunday), with the right DJ (White
Lightning) -- the Sunset Strip can seem downright Caribbean.
Dance-hall reggae blares through enormous speakers, and the masses
sip Guinness and Red Stripe. They may be in Hollywood, where dancing
violates cooler-than-thou etiquette, but 800 partygoers flock to the
dance floor in droves.</LD>
<LD>   At one end of the bar, two Belizean girls mouth words to every
track. At the other end, Jessica Ryan, who just moved to L.A. from
Pennsylvania, is discovering a whole new scene. "We were driving on
the Strip looking for a club, and we came in here," she shouts over
Beenie Man's "Girls Dem Sugar." "I never really listen to reggae, but
after tonight -- this club is amazing! -- I'm definitely going CD
shopping."</LD>
<LD>   Such conversions are familiar to the evening's hosts, White
Lightning and Q-Bwoy (a.k.a. Jamie Koz and Quie Anthony). As the
founders of Jamaican Gold, L.A.'s longest-running reggae night, they
have, as Lightning puts it, "been making reggae fans in L.A. for
years."</LD>
<TE>   Eight years, to be exact, during which Jamaican Gold evolved from
a once-a-week, 400-head party into a roving reggae empire. On three
nights, at different venues, Jamaican Gold has established itself as
a nightlife force with a slew of reggae and hip-hop DJs, teams of
dancers, various MCs and an impressive Web site. Sean Paul's reggae
single "Gimme the Light" may be riding high on the charts these days,
but Jamaican Gold sustained reggae fans well before such crossover
successes did.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, you can't go into a club and not hear our format," says
Q-Bwoy. "Most DJs now have to give the crowd at least one reggae
set."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always so. Eight years ago, Q-Bwoy and Lightning met at
one of L.A.'s only reggae clubs: Kingston 12 in Santa Monica, where
Lightning spun records and Q-Bwoy ran a hip-hop night. The
transplanted New Yorker and the L.A. native started their own reggae
night, soon moving to the Martini Lounge on Melrose.</TE>
<TE>   Offering virtually the only reggae scene in town (Kingston 12
closed and the Jamaica House started spinning more hip-hop than
reggae), the pair first had the challenge of getting word out.
Instead of producing fliers to litter Hollywood, they flooded the
streets with Jamaican Gold membership cards, which offered an entry
discount. It became impossible to exit clubs or record stores without
encountering the cards with Bob Marley's visage.</TE>
<TE>   The next feat was getting a reggae-wary mixed crowd, from
Hollywood and beyond, to enjoy the music.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd get frustrated because we have hip-hop DJs too, and when it
was time for my reggae set, people were like, 'Put back the hip-hop,
man!' " Lightning recalls. "But over time, and with the right
records, we'd turn people on to reggae. And now, people ask me when
the hip-hop set will be over."</TE>
<TE>   Within two years, Jamaican Gold found homes in venues ranging from
the Dragonfly to the Century Club to Gotham Hall. They now draw
between 500 and 800 reggae lovers Thursdays at Dragonfly, Fridays at
the Martini Lounge and Sundays, their biggest night, at the House of
Blues. Although other reggae clubs have cropped up over the years,
none has the longevity, or the same crowd, of Jamaican Gold.</TE>
<TE>   "Our crowd is a melting pot, because really, reggae music is about
bringing people together," Q-Bwoy says of his multiethnic team:
Jamaican Gold's DJs, dancers, and MCs are black, white, Jewish, Asian
and Latino. In addition to reggae DJs, Jamaican Gold boasts a hip-hop
lineup that includes DJ Vice from radio station Power 106 (KPWR-FM
105.9). Over the summer, they took their act to packed clubs in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunset Strip venue can be deceptive: Jamaican Gold is not your
typical Hollywood club. There's no dress code; everyone gets in; and
the music trumps the "scene." On performance nights, Q-Bwoy and
Lightning have brought in everyone from Born Jamericans and
Barrington Levy to Rayvon and even Mos Def, but the top admission
remains $20. "We love our crowd, and we owe them that," Lightning
says.</TE>
<TE>   And with winter setting in, the entry fee is cheaper than a flight
to the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were the '60s, Jamaican Gold would be the best hippie
spot in the world," Q-Bwoy says with a grin. If the crowd at Sunday's
House of Blues is any indication, he must be right.</TE>

<HD>Into the L.A. mix</HD>
<DH>With projects galore, will DJ Paul Oakenfold catch a wave?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis Romero</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DJ culture has gone Hollywood, if you haven't heard.</LD>
<LD>   You can hardly watch a car commercial without hearing thumping
house beats (Mitsubishi, Saab and Chrysler's PT Cruiser move to the
groove, to name a few), and such electronic music luminaries as Jason
Bentley and Brian Transeau have been busy compiling soundtracks and
scoring films.</LD>
<LD>   Now Paul Oakenfold, the world's most popular DJ, has come breezing
down the red carpet. The Brit recently bought a home in Los Angeles
and plans to spend the winter here, schmoozing no doubt.</LD>
<TE>   Oakey, as he's known, is a natural fit for the industry scene. He
wears his crisp collars open, sports Prada shades and can have a
brash tongue ("The best thing a DJ in America could do, and I'm not
dissing New York or America in any way, is come over to England and
see how it's done," he said in 1998).</TE>
<TE>   And although DJs in this town are held in about as much esteem as
valets, Oakenfold has it all worked out: He concludes a 15-date tour
in support of his first album of original music, "Bunkka," on
Saturday by putting on a live show at the Wiltern "with band," as his
Web site attests. He's also in the lineup for tonight's KIIS-FM
Jingle Ball at Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   He's doing more and more studio work, has a second CD with his own
compositions in the works, and more film music to come. Oakenfold's
not the most innovative music maker in the world, nor is he the most
skilled club DJ, but he arguably is the best businessman dance music
has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   According to SoundScan, "Bunkka" has sold more than 160,000 copies
since its June debut, which makes it a Billboard dance chart Top 10
mainstay. From hip-hop to house to trance, Oakenfold has juiced wave
after wave of pop culture phenomena since the mid-'80s. With
"Bunkka's" soulless but cleanly produced "nu skool" break-beats,
muted vocal trance and chaotic collaborations with Hunter S.
Thompson, Ice Cube and Nelly Furtado, he seems in dire need of a new
wave, and L.A. isn't a bad place to go trend surfing.</TE>
<TE>   It's a Hollywood tradition (see "The Fast and the Furious" or
"Blue Crush") -- the people who innovate and participate in youth
culture aren't necessarily the ones well-compensated. Oakenfold
should feel right at home as part of a long line of musical culture
marketers, from punk and new-wave visionary Malcolm McLaren to
hip-hop king Russell Simmons to L.A.'s own dance radio pioneer
"Swedish" Egil Aalvik.</TE>
<TE>   A 1987 trip to the Spanish party mecca isle of Ibiza with future
cover-jocks Danny Rampling and Nicky Holloway led to Oakenfold's
Monday night Spectrum parties at the London club Heaven, which
coincided with the widespread use of Ecstasy and the explosion of
rave culture fueled by Chicago "acid house." A 1995 trip to the
Indian region of Goa, then frequented by Euro-travelers and buoyed by
German trance, inspired Oakenfold to spin the synthetic, emotional
trance genre, propelling him to rock-level stardom and making him the
leader in an avalanche of trance-mix compilation albums that arguably
have outsold any other form of e-music.</TE>
<TE>   Oakenfold has sold more than 1.3 million records, mostly mix CDs
featuring tracks by various artists, including "Tranceport," "Global
Underground: New York" and "Perfecto Presents: Ibiza." Along with
countrymen Sasha and John Digweed, he has taken the old homemade "mix
tape" and made it a cheap-to-produce money-maker that simply strings
together other artists' licensed dance singles.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Oakenfold's work has relied on the worldwide popularity of
trance, a driving Germanic take on Detroit techno that artists such
as Transeau Jam &amp; Spoon and Oakenfold himself later tamed with calmer
piano licks and sweet girl vocals.</TE>
<TE>   But trance hit a creative wall in 2000, with a furious backlash in
the upper ranks of the superstar DJ circuit. Oakenfold clearly has
tried to move on to the tougher "progressive" sounds of today. With
"Bunkka," he also gambled that mid-tempo break-beat songs that blend
trancey synths with twisted, drum-and-bass-style rhythm production is
the next thing. It certainly hasn't hit the trendsetting bull's-eye
Oakenfold once nailed with hip-hop, house and trance.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, he's in L.A. now. People don't care about DJs' latest
fancies, progressive this and nu skool that -- but they do eye the
wallet, and so far it looks like the Guinness Book of World Records'
"most successful DJ" will be welcomed to the club, so long as he
isn't toting his DJ bag.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>KCBS-TV Channel 2 newsman Joel Grover, best known for his 1997
undercover reports that led to a grading system on local restaurants,
has left the station, saying he wants to pursue other opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   "This is purely my choice," Grover said Wednesday, adding that his
contract expires at the end of the year. "CBS made me a very good
offer, which would have allowed me to do local and network reports. I
really agonized over this decision, but I have a number of great
potential opportunities. I just feel that it's time to move on."</LD>
<LD>   Grover, who has been at KCBS for six years, said he will take a
few months off to relax and decide on his next move.</LD>
<TE>   His series "Behind the Kitchen Door" concluded that many
restaurants repeatedly failed inspections by the Los Angeles County
Department of Health yet remained open. The reports used hidden
camera footage to expose numerous health code violations, rodent and
insect infestations and improper food handling. The series resulted
in huge ratings for the station.</TE>
<TE>   Grover said he is also proud of other investigative reports he did
but acknowledged that that one stands out.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'll be seeing letter grades in restaurants as long as I
live," he said. "I hope I can top that series."</TE>

<LD>The Paris fashion world is about to lose one of its brightest stars
after French cosmetics company Clarins announced plans Wednesday to
close down its money-losing Thierry Mugler couture label.</LD>
<LD>   A Clarins spokesman said the company would keep Mugler's
profitable perfume division but would shut down its ready-to-wear
activities.</LD>
<LD>   Mugler's edgy creations in materials such as vinyl and monkey hair
frequently landed the Strasbourg-born designer in hot water with
feminists who criticized him for turning women into cartoon
superheroes. But his razor-sharp tailored jackets symbolized career
women in the 1980s. The label gradually lost its cachet during the
'90s, however.</LD>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Mugler, who withdrew from day-to-day design
activities two years ago, said he had no comment on the decision.
Clarins bought the company in 1997.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul McCartney defends his decision to reverse the order of the
famous Lennon-McCartney songwriting credit.</LD>
<LD>   After 40 years of second billing to John Lennon, McCartney has
turned the tables on his late Beatles collaborator in his new
project. "Back in the U.S. Live 2002," a two-CD live album, includes
19 classic Beatles songs billed as written by "Paul McCartney and
John Lennon."</LD>
<LD>   "I think it is fair and accurate for the songs that John declared
were mine to carry my name first," McCartney said Wednesday. "This
isn't anything I'm going to lose any sleep over, nor is it anything
that will cause litigation. But it seems to be harmless to me, after
more than 30 years of it being the other way.</LD>
<TE>   "The truth is that this is much ado about nothing, and there is no
need for anybody to get their knickers in a twist."</TE>

<HD>New 'Singin'' print is anniversary gift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Cinematheque will mark the 50th anniversary of "Singin'
in the Rain," long regarded as the one of the greatest -- if not,
indeed, the greatest -- of American film musicals with several
screenings daily through Wednesday. Warner Bros. Classics has
prepared a new print with digitally restored sound and images. Friday
night's 7:15 opening screening will be introduced by Barbara Freed
Saltzman, daughter of producer Arthur Freed</LD>
<LD>   A fresh viewing of the film, a holiday treat if ever there was
one, on a pristine print only reinforces the film's enduring stature.
Its evergreen songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Freed are set off by
Betty Comden and the late Adolph Green's script, one of the wittiest
ever for a musical, a knowing, affectionate satire of Hollywood as it
was hit by the talkie revolution.</LD>
<LD>   It's directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly and stars Kelly as a
Douglas Fairbanks-type swashbuckling star coping with the advent of
sound. So is his gorgeous leading lady (an unforgettably funny yet
poignant Jean Hagen), cursed with a screechy voice and low-class
accent that might defy the most skilled and persistent of elocution
teachers. It co-stars Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New Beverly Cinema is offering a double feature tonight of
recent films by Takashi Miike, one of Japan's most venturesome
contemporary filmmakers. "The Happiness of the Katakuris" (7:30 p.m.)
is in the Japanese tradition of pitch-dark absurdist comedy. It
combines a spoof of the cliches of the Hollywood musical with a plot
that faintly echoes that of the French classic "The Red Inn" (1951)
but with the difference that the few guests of this film's inn tend
to wind up dead inadvertently rather than intentionally.</TE>
<TE>   Miike's "Audition" (at 9:30 p.m.) begins like a classic, gentle
Yasujiro Ozu parent-and-child drama, but 45 minutes into it we get
hints that we're in for something rather different. Even then there's
no way of knowing that this audacious film, to describe it mildly,
will present some of the most horrific images ever seen in a serious
work produced for general release.</TE>
<TE>   Miike is such a compelling filmmaker that he makes it hard to turn
away from the unspeakable. While he packs a major jolt for horror
fans, "Audition" is actually carrying a critique of the lingering
subordinate status of women in Asian society to its horrendous,
hideous extreme.</TE>
<TE>   Ryo Ishibashi stars as a good-looking, long-widowed 42-year-old
businessman who thinks he has met the perfect mate in Eihi Shiina's
exquisite, waif-like onetime ballet student. "Audition" is a
diabolically adroit piece of filmmaking that goes even further than
the films of Italy's excruciatingly macabre Dario Argento.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Note: The New Beverly also has a terrific French double feature,
"Read My Lips" and "With a Friend Like Harry ... ," on Friday and
Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Recalling a bolt from the blue</HD>

<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am convinced: Every lonely person needs at least one visit from the
man with the blue drink. But before I tell you about this memorable
man and his antidote for blue days, let me share why I've been
thinking about him. A single and lovely girlfriend was recently
lamenting that another year was drawing to a close and there was no
special someone on her horizon. In searching for the words to comfort
her, I was torn. I couldn't sort out which felt worse: spending month
after month going about our busy Los Angeles lives, with no soulful
connection to a member of the opposite sex; or finally loving someone
with all of your being in this isolating metropolis, only to lose
him?</LD>
<LD>   For my pretty friend, 2002 goes down as another empty collage of
months in which no man made a lasting impression. On my end it was
the opposite. What I had written off as impossible in this flaky town
happened so fast and intensely that it still seems like as if it
happened to someone else.</LD>
<LD>   Early this year I fell madly in love, despite my stubborn belief
that love in this millennium only leads to disillusion and pain. But
the object of my affections proved a relentless and steady force who
nicknamed me Jade (for my jadedness) and intuitively knew me,
accepted me and cared about me.</LD>
<TE>   With time I came around. I had to. If soul mates exist, this was
the closest I'd ever come. But even when it's that good, it does not
mean it's permanent. When my girlfriend verbalized her sadness, I had
no choice but to reflect on my own. It still seems cruel,
particularly in light of the heartache that preceded him, that
someone like him landed on my path if he wasn't meant to stay.</TE>
<TE>   So I did what all girlfriends do. I called another girlfriend, one
who has been there for me for 15 years and counting. It had been a
long time since either one of us had invoked the blue drink man, but
on this day when all I could focus on was my despair, Gina did what
all good friends do. "Do you remember the man that gave us those blue
drinks?" she asked softly. Oh, do I. He came into our lives a dozen
years ago at a sidewalk cafe in Miami's South Beach. I had just
broken up with my first love, and I was sobbing so hard my ribs hurt.
Gina had run out of words when he approached us.</TE>
<TE>   "Enjoy your tears," the man said. "That's not funny," Gina
answered. "No, I mean it," he said. "You are crying over a boyfriend,
right? Enjoy it. Your tears are special. You are so young. Before you
know it, you will forget him and love again." "He is special," I
defended my love.</TE>
<TE>   On that scorching, humid afternoon, I couldn't fathom loving
another. I informed the nosy stranger that my beloved was going to
medical school far away, and we both knew we lacked the maturity to
endure a long-distance relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the more reason to enjoy your tears," he said. "It means you
have loved someone worthy of it. Do you know how many people go
through their lives never knowing this kind of love?" With that, he
disappeared to the bar. When he returned, he had three tall drinks
the hue of the Atlantic (we still don't know what was in them). For
the rest of the afternoon, the three of us shared love stories and a
table as I laughed, cried and downed glass after glass of aqua-blue
liquor.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years later, there is Gina on the telephone from Miami
reminding me of the lessons that were served with those blue drinks.
Just because a love doesn't last does not mean it wasn't real. And
more importantly, says Gina, "You opened yourself up and your heart
loved again. You can't be sad about that."</TE>
<TE>   No, I can't. Here's to blue drinks and blue days They both help us
to appreciate good times, best friends and great loves more.</TE>

<LD>The cookbook is displayed in typical Costco fashion, on an enormous
table amid mounds of other discount books, somewhere between a pallet
of men's bathrobes and a stack of clarinets. Its title: "Entertaining
the Costco Way." The price: a mere $9.99.</LD>
<LD>   That's right -- Costco, purveyor of mega-jars of mayonnaise and
super-sized steak packs that could feed entire towns -- has
officially entered the fray as publisher with this, its first book.
Introduced for the holidays, the 271-page glossy is currently the
store's top-selling cookbook. And no wonder. It's chock-full of more
than 300 recipes that can be whipped together using commonly
purchased items from the 38-million-member bulk retailer -- all of
them submitted by celebrity chefs like Sara Moulton or, more
commonly, Costco suppliers, members and employees.</LD>
<LD>   Among the offerings: Skippy chicken sate with peanut sauce, Ragu
chili and the mildly alarming Dean Specialty Foods' fried dill
pickles. One recipe, submitted by warehouse member Nancy Stanton, is
for true Costco fanatics. Simply titled Costco-Coded Supper Dish, its
ingredients have been converted into item number codes, with the
recipe calling for 1/3 cup of #22863, two large #67245 and a dash of
#848038, among other things. What that makes, only a die-hard shopper
would know, but the accompanying photo shows something with potatoes.</LD>
<TE>   Like many of the book's recipes, Stanton's supper dish serves a
modest eight -- not quite the army one would expect, given the
store's jumbo offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "You can cook for less than a regiment. It doesn't have to be
brigade size," said Jim Sinegal, Costco's chief executive and
president. "The book's not done up for someone with a dinner party
for two. It's for entertaining."</TE>
<TE>   Separated into seasons and specific events, the book takes readers
through the entire year. Whether it's a traditional Christmas dinner
or quaint afternoon tea party, rowdy tailgater or blowout birthday,
Costco's got it covered. And it isn't just the food.</TE>
<TE>   In the segment on hosting a romantic bridal luncheon, the book
plugs a KitchenAid mixer, Henckels knife set and Osterizer blender --
all of which, the book suggests, would be perfect gifts for that
special bride-to-be. And all of which can be conveniently purchased
at Costco. Costco, it seems, isn't just publishing but pioneering an
entirely new category: the catalog cookbook.</TE>
<TE>   Pushing her way past shoppers whose carts were filled with walls
of toilet paper and crates of apple juice, Vaida Mikuckis of La
Canada stopped to pick up a copy of the book at the Costco in Atwater
Village. She and her husband were having a party the following
weekend and she was "looking for fast things that are easy to do."</TE>
<TE>   She flipped through some pages, then returned it to the stack.
"I'll probably buy stuff already pre-made here. Probably some
honey-baked hams and supplement them with cheese and shrimp
platters," she said, wheeling her cart toward the deli counter.</TE>
<TE>   Mikuckis may not have bought the book, but she was still
entertaining the Costco way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   A dash of #848038</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to tell whether Nancy Stanton's Costco-Coded Supper Dish
is a recipe or a quiz. Calling for two large #67425, a dash of
#848038 and one large bag of #5685, among other ingredients, it's
entirely written in warehouse item codes. Preparation instructions
ask cooks to "heat a large skillet and add 3 tablespoons #22863 and
butter." The solution to this riddle is somewhere in "Entertaining
the Costco Way," but, as its editor warns, you'll just have to hunt
for it!</TE>

<HD>Meaning in gleaning</HD>
<DH>Agnes Varda's documentary sequel is a journey of discovery
for her and her subjects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ON a brief recent visit Agnes Varda arranged for a private screening
at the American Cinematheque of "The Gleaners and I ... Two Years
Later," the 65-minute sequel to her 2000 landmark documentary.</LD>
<LD>   "The Gleaners and I" is a beautiful, contemplative and remarkably
resonant film in which Varda traveled over the French countryside to
see if gleaning -- the ancient custom of allowing the poor to comb
the fields for leftover grains, fruits and vegetables after a harvest
-- still persisted. The journey would allow Varda, now 75 and often
called "the Grandmother of the French New Wave," to try out one of
the new small digital cameras and to confront her own journey into
old age. (Never mind that the short and sturdy Varda, with her Dutch
bob, upturned nose and penetrating gaze, has changed little over the
decades and with no discernible loss of passion and energy.) This
surpassing film of self-discovery also enabled Varda to express her
passion for art and to comment on waste in a prosperous consumer
society.</LD>
<TE>   Varda's starting point was Jean-Francois Millet's famous 1857
painting "The Gleaners," which depicts three women stooped over,
gleaning a wheat field, and it became an extended metaphor for random
forms of scavenging, mainly by the homeless. "The Gleaners and I"
became a huge hit in France, was enthusiastically received the world
over, won a shelf full of trophies, and best of all, recharged Varda,
who had devoted most of her energies to preserving the films of her
late husband, director Jacques Demy, who died in 1989. (Currently,
she's overseeing the restoration of Demy's enchanting 1972 fairy tale
"Donkey Skin.")</TE>
<TE>   Introducing "Two Years Later" to an audience of friends and
admirers in the Egyptian's Spielberg Theater, Varda said that what
started out as a 15-minute "bonus" for the original film's DVD and
VHS release turned out to be a full-fledged sequel. Although two
small theaters in Paris are set to show "Two Years Later," Varda and
her American distributor Zeitgeist, who already have "The Gleaners
and I" and "Two Years Later" in DVD and VHS release, have no plans
for a theatrical release.</TE>
<TE>   "Two Years Later" opens with Varda telling of the vast array of
letters, many of them fanciful and touching, that "The Gleaners and
I" brought her. She tracks down several of the original documentary's
most memorable individuals, among the Claude, the unapologetic
alcoholic of unshakable dignity who is now doing much better; Alain,
the teacher of illiterates who subsists on garbage; and the
distinguished vintner-psychiatrist who this time sees psychoanalysis
as a form of gleaning. She triggers the retrieval from storage and
restoration of Pierre-Edmond Hedouin's 1857's "The Gleaners," whose
once-celebrated lyrical beauty looks false and dated alongside the
enduring social realism of the originally reviled Millet masterpiece.
"Two Years Later" is a joyous film in which Varda embraces life
warmly but unsentimentally and in which she again finds in the same
field a heart-shaped potato, the perfect symbol for an artist who has
always had her feet on the ground but whose passionate curiosity and
concern sprout out in all directions.</TE>

<LD>After 39 days of machinations, accusations and confrontations,
"Survivor: Thailand" crowns the series' latest millionaire from among
the final four contestants tonight in a two-hour finale at 8 on CBS.</LD>
<LD>   Will it be Brian, the former soft-porn actor who made the tabloids
this week after allegedly getting punched out by his wife? Or maybe
Helen, the swim instructor who never met an alliance she didn't like.
Fellow Texans Clay and Jan would seem to be longshots at best.</LD>
<LD>   As in the previous four editions of the globe-trotting "Survivor"
franchise, the original 16 contestants will gather after the winner
is revealed for a one-hour reunion special at 10 that is always good
for some juicy moments. Bryant Gumbel was moderator for the first
three reunions and Rosie O'Donnell filled in last year, but series
host Jeff Probst will keep the job in-house this time.</LD>
<TE>   An audience of 52 million was on hand for the first "Survivor"
finale on May 31, 2000, helping to jump-start a reality-TV trend that
is still spawning imitators. The audience had dwindled to about 25
million for the fourth-edition finale of "Survivor: Marquesas" in
February, and tonight's three-hour block should be in the same
neighborhood, enough to keep CBS execs smiling even though the phenom
days may be long gone.</TE>
<TE>   For those mourning tonight's finale, fret not: "Survivor: Amazon"
is only a couple months away.</TE>

<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pearce is the sort of space that defies both expectation and easy
definition. Part gallery, part boutique and part playground, the
Venice storefront is a kind of modern-era curiosity shoppe, filled
with objects similar only in their strangely appealing eclecticism.</LD>
<LD>   The space's co-owners, Nancy Pearce and Alma Allen, are Utah
natives who met as teens in Salt Lake City and eventually reunited in
Los Angeles last year. At that time, Pearce was working in the
Universal Studios Archives, helping to organize exhibitions and
screenings, among them the studios' extensive photo show at the
Louvre. Allen had just left New York City, where he had established
himself as a successful sculptor, earning an impressive roster of
collectors, including fashion designers Julio Espada and Todd Oldham.</LD>
<LD>   Painted a pristine eggshell white from floor to ceiling, with
Pasadena artist Kelly Mulloy's richly colored wool tapestries lining
the walls, Pearce is a wonderfully visual experience. The store's
unique offerings are pleasingly arranged atop Allen's custom-made
shelves and tables; fragile mid-century Scandinavian glass, minutely
detailed graphite carvings (in shapes ranging from lotus flowers to
fava beans), vintage ceramics and yellow dandelions suspended in
clear Lucite.</LD>
<TE>   The bulk of the store's merchandise, however, consists of Allen's
sculptures, incredibly tactile and delicately beautiful bits of
polished wood and smooth stone, which lend the shop the feel of a Zen
garden gone slightly, whimsically, askew.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important to us to find things to put together that might
otherwise have been out of context," Allen says of the store's
aesthetic, "a 600-year-old Chinese artifact next to a plastic doll or
a glass ray gun, objects that aren't purely decorative but that open
discussion and have a story to them."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to engage customers, Allen's handcrafted stools
(carved of wood and some topped with brightly colored laminate) are
scattered throughout the room, and visitors are invited to sit, play,
rearrange and explore.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted this to be an experimental space in that way," says
Pearce, who is also planning workshops and screenings for the store.
"We want people to come and sit and interact with the objects and
make their own relationships with them."</TE>
<TE>   "Sculpture is made to be touched," adds Allen.</TE>
<TE>   "These pieces were made with my hands, and I want people to feel
the weight and the shape of them. That's the point."</TE>

<LD>"Minority Report"</LD>
<LD>   Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell</LD>
<LD>   Fox, $30</LD>
<TE>   Steven Spielberg's dark, disturbing, film noir sci-fi thriller,
based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, is set in the near future,
when three human beings called "precogs" envision murders before they
are committed. Tom Cruise plays a "Precrime" law enforcer who finds
himself on the run when he turns up a murderer in one of the precog
visions.</TE>
<TE>   The nifty two-disc DVD set does not include commentary by
Spielberg, but comprehensive documentaries on the discs give insight
into the making of this complex picture, which is filled with
cutting-edge visual effects and thrilling stunts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Unfaithful"</TE>
<TE>   Diane Lane, Richard Gere</TE>
<TE>   Fox, $28</TE>
<TE>   Diane Lane received some of the best reviews of her career for her
performance in Adrian Lyne's overheated erotic thriller about a wife
and mother who enters into a dangerous affair with a very seductive
Frenchman (the oh-so-hot Olivier Martinez) she meets casually one day
in New York. Gere plays her sweet, affectionate husband, who decides
to take matters into his own hands.</TE>
<TE>   Lane also is the star of the DVD -- most notably with her
commentary, in which she discusses how she got involved in the
project and her feelings about her character. The digital edition
also features 11 deleted scenes (including an alternate ending), cast
interviews, a visit with veteran film editor Anne V. Coates and
commentary from Lyne.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "An Evening With Kevin Smith"</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Smith</TE>
<TE>   Columbia TriStar, $28</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a.k.a. Silent Bob, the rotund writer-director of art-house
flicks "Clerks," "Chasing Amy," "Dogma" and "Jay and Silent Bob
Strike Back," isn't so silent in this two-disc set, which features
his ribald, racy and sometimes offensive appearances at such colleges
as the University of Wyoming and Kent State. Although some may faint
at his language and frank sexual talk, Smith is quick-witted and
handles questions from the audience with wit and candor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Back to the Future -- The Complete Trilogy"</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd</TE>
<TE>   Universal, $57</TE>
<TE>   Robert Zemeckis' clever, highly entertaining 1985 time-travel hit,
which made a movie star out of Fox, has finally entered the digital
age, packaged with the two disappointing sequels. The set --
available in either wide-screen or pan-and-scan -- features
documentaries that were produced during the making of the films,
commentaries with co-writer and producer Bob Gale and producer Neal
Canton, deleted scenes, a nifty "Animated Anecdotes" that provides
the option of seeing facts and trivia notes while viewing each movie,
a Q&amp;A with Zemeckis and Gale, and scene-specific commentary on the
first film with Fox.</TE>

hymns and holiday songs makes its way through</TE>

about German business dealings with Iraq provided incorrect
information. In the quote published, an analyst said, "Germany really
played a major role in equipping Iraq with dual-use goods that ended
in the weapons of mass destruction industry throughout the 1990s." It
was actually in the 1980s.</LD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HCA Inc., the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain, agreed to
pay the Justice Department $631 million to settle allegations of
health-care fraud, ending nearly a decade of federal investigations.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement of the civil charges still needs formal approval
from the Justice Department and courts. But it would bring to $1.7
billion the amount HCA has paid or agreed to pay the government in
civil fines and criminal penalties in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Whistle-blowers accused HCA of filing false claims for
reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid and paying kickbacks to
doctors so they would refer patients to its hospitals. HCA did not
admit wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   HCA shares rose $1.39 to close at $42.90 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Sales increased 60% to $2.95

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Bertelsmann unit sued Liquid Audio Inc., accusing the money-losing
Internet music provider of planning to distribute $58 million in
dividends illegally instead of saving the money for creditors.</LD>
<LD>   Liquid Audio said it would pay a $2.50-a-share dividend, according
to a lawsuit filed in Delaware by BeMusic Inc.</LD>
<LD>   BeMusic says it licensed software in 1999 from Liquid Audio, which
agreed to pay $20 million in potential damages and half of defense
costs if BeMusic loses a patent-infringement lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Liquid Audio fell 20 cents to $2.55 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>More Pieces Falling Into Place for Downtown Revitalization</HD>
<DH>Emmys may move to new venue, provide leverage for nearby
hotel</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Emmys have won a supporting role in Anschutz Entertainment
Group's efforts to attract public financing for part of its planned
$1-billion hotel, retail and entertainment complex near Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences announced Wednesday that
it has signed a letter of intent to switch its signature event, TV's
Emmy Awards, to a 7,000-seat theater slated to be at the center of
the Anschutz complex.</LD>
<LD>   But the academy also said that before it moves the Emmys, the
downtown Los Angeles site must include a planned 1,200-room hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Should everything fall into place, the complex could be ready for
the red carpet treatment in time for the 2006 Emmy telecast.</TE>
<TE>   "If they build it, we will come," said Academy Chairman Bryce
Zabel.</TE>
<TE>   But that's a big if.</TE>
<TE>   So far, key city officials haven't indicated that they are willing
to provide the public funds that Anschutz Entertainment Group says it
needs to move ahead with the project.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, for one, opposes the use of tax
dollars for any part of the complex, including the proposed hotel,
according to his spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   AEG executives say they plan to use private financing to build the
$65-million theater. However, they are seeking some combination of
public funds to build the 45-story hotel, at a cost of $300 million
to $400 million. And, they say, they cannot move forward with their
plans for the entire project until the hotel financing gets resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Academy executives also say that if the hotel -- complete with
banquet halls -- is not built, the Emmys probably will stay at their
longtime home at the Shrine Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hope is that we can clear the last hurdle on the hotel and
move forward with the project," said Tim Lieweke, AEG president. He
said that signing up a glitzy anchor tenant such as the Emmys should
help further his firm's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "The Emmys are a very big chip -- we're excited about them,"
Lieweke said. "All of the dominoes are coming together, and the last
step will be the hotel."</TE>
<TE>   But clouding the picture is a lawsuit filed in June by Los Angeles
County. It seeks to stop the city's downtown redevelopment plan,
alleging it would illegally deprive the county of $278 million in
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative agreement to move the Emmys, approved by the academy
board of governors last week, stipulates that the award show would be
the theater's marquee event. The pact spelled out that the Grammys
and the Oscars can't be held on the same stage.</TE>
<TE>   That's acceptable to AEG because the company, which is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz's Anschutz
Corp., also operates the Kodak Theatre, the Oscars' new home on
Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   It likewise owns Staples Center, which hosted the Grammy Awards in
February. The company is trying to lure the Grammys, which will be
held next year in New York, back to Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The television academy can back out of the tentative agreement
until the end of 2003 if the organization concludes that a hotel will
not be built.</TE>
<TE>   The contract would cover 15 years, with a 10-year additional
option that the academy could exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement also calls for an area suitable for red carpet
facilities, bleachers for fans and adjacent parking for limos. AEG
must consult the academy about any corporate name that would festoon
the facility. Fast-food restaurants, alcohol and tobacco would be
prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   The accord also calls for both sides to explore an Emmy-themed
museum for the entertainment plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The academy would pay an annual fee for use of the theater
commensurate with what television networks now pay to rent the Shrine
Auditorium for the award show, or about $150,000 a year, said Herb
Jellinek, the academy's chief operating officer.</TE>

<HD>Federal Probe of Baby Bells Urged</HD>
<DH>Comments by chairman of Qwest raise questions about the
competitive zeal of the regional phone companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two members of Congress called on the Justice Department on Wednesday
to launch an antitrust investigation of the failure -- possibly the
refusal -- of the regional Baby Bell companies to compete against
each other.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Reps. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-San
Jose), seizing on a top executive's public comments in October,
allege that the Baby Bells have refused to enter each other's local
service markets even though the 1996 Telecommunications Act was
designed to encourage such competition.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, the two point out that
"any arrangement to carve up market territories would not be
permitted under antitrust law."</LD>
<TE>   Conyers and Lofgren said they were troubled by a statement made by
Richard Notebaert, chairman of Qwest Communications International
Inc. In a talk with Chicago Tribune reporters, he was quoted as
saying that it would be fundamentally wrong to compete against, say,
SBC Communications Inc., noting that it "might be a good way to turn
a quick dollar but that doesn't make it right."</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for San Antonio-based SBC and Qwest said that the quote
did not refer to overall competition and that the companies are
competing against each other. Qwest covers local service in 14
Western states and SBC operates in 13 states including California,
where its unit formerly was known as Pacific Bell.</TE>
<TE>   But they also said they aren't offering local service to
residential and small business customers outside their territories
because the regulated pricing system is not workable and could change
soon under a pending review by the Federal Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "We compete vigorously outside our market for long-distance and
local service, long-haul [data service] and [high-speed] DSL
service," said Billy Myers, a Qwest spokesman. "But we're not
competing for residential and small business customers outside our
market because of the way rates are structured."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups, though, said that an antitrust investigation of
the four Baby Bells, which also include Verizon Communications Inc.
and BellSouth Inc., is warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "The Baby Bells had no intention of competing against each other,"
said Regina Costa, research director at the Utility Reform Network.
"Residential and small business customers are key. The telecom act
means that ordinary customers are supposed to benefit from
competition."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers'
Action Network, said that Conyers and Lofgren have the right idea but
for the wrong reason. Notebaert, he said, was talking about not
engaging in local residential business that could be scuttled if
regulators change the rules, which many believe is likely in the next
few months.</TE>
<TE>   "What is a compelling argument for antitrust review is that,
without the regulatory guarantee of a competitive playing field, new
entrants are fearful of the incumbents' competitive advantage,"
Shames said. "If I were a large company, I would not want to go up
against these monsters."</TE>
<TE>   As it is, he said, AT&amp;T Corp. and WorldCom Inc.'s MCI unit are
offering California residents calling plans that are only marginally
competitive to what SBC is offering. SBC covers 78% of the state and
controls 90% of the local access lines. The Baby Bells, ensured of
monopolies in their regions, were set up in the 1984 break-up of AT&amp;T
to handle local service only. Since then, they have grown in size and
power, consolidating from the original seven companies.</TE>

<HD>Cable, TV Companies Reach Deal on HDTV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable operators and TV manufacturers have struck a long-awaited
agreement designed to make it easier for consumers to get
high-definition television from cable, ensure their ability to record
most digital programs and preserve the value of older HDTV sets.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which is expected to be announced today, would open the
door for cable-ready digital TV sets that could deliver HDTV without
a separate set-top box. This kind of plug-and-play simplicity is
crucial for digital TV, set manufacturers say, because about
two-thirds of U.S. homes rely on cable to deliver their TV signals.</LD>
<LD>   "If we can cross this hurdle, I think we can really open the
floodgates for consumer interest" in digital TV, said David H.
Arland, director of government and public relations for Thomson
Multimedia, which owns the RCA brand.</LD>
<TE>   The deal won't take effect, however, unless the Federal
Communications Commission adopts a regulation applying the agreement
to all cable and satellite operators. At least some of the provisions
are expected to draw opposition from satellite companies, TV
programmers and Hollywood studios, which were excluded from the
private negotiations between cable operators and set makers.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the cable operators' and manufacturers' trade
associations declined to discuss the deal, which took more than five
months to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   One likely sticking point involves the scrambling of HDTV signals.
The proposed regulation would effectively bar cable and satellite
operators from scrambling the signals all the way to the TV set,
according to sources close to the negotiations. End-to-end scrambling
would help guard programs against piracy -- a key goal for the
studios and networks -- but it also would prevent older HDTV sets
from displaying them.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer electronics manufacturers and cable operators have
battled for years over how to make TVs work with all U.S. cable
systems, which use a variety of incompatible techniques to scramble
channels and deter piracy. The FCC stepped in four years ago,
ordering cable operators to develop standardized security modules
that could be plugged into any TV set or converter box with a
matching slot.</TE>
<TE>   That order has borne little fruit, mainly because set makers
balked at the conditions cable operators wanted to place on using the
modules. But FCC efforts to spur the transition to digital TV helped
drive the parties back to the negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   The overall thrust of the agreement is simple: to let
manufacturers sell basic digital TV sets that can receive all cable
channels -- including ones carrying HDTV programs -- through a simple
wall connection. Video on demand and other interactive services would
still require a set-top box, although future talks may pave the way
for more advanced cable-ready digital TVs.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the negotiations said the two sides grappled with
complex issues concern- ing how digital shows are recorded,
transmitted and protected against piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators ultimately agreed to numerous limits on the
security measures they can impose, sources said, but only if the FCC
imposes the same limits on satellite operators. That way, cable
operators wouldn't risk losing programs -- and customers -- to their
top competitors, Hughes Electronics Corp.'s DirecTV and EchoStar
Communications Corp.'s Dish Network.</TE>
<TE>   Sources outlined the following provisions of the deal, which may
prove to be the most controversial:</TE>
<TE>   * Analog connectors. The vast majority of the 4 million digital TV
sets and monitors already sold to consumers rely on analog sockets to
connect to cable and satellite boxes. Unlike digital connectors,
analog inputs can't handle a scrambled signal.</TE>
<TE>   The cable industry had wanted to let programmers send some HDTV
shows to sets with only digital connections, a feature of the newest
digital TVs. But the agreement calls for the FCC to prevent cable and
satellite operators from doing that.</TE>
<TE>   * Downgraded HDTV signals. Instead of turning off analog
connectors, some programmers had sought to limit the picture quality
of signals sent to those inputs in order to deter pirates from
copying HDTV shows.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed regulation would bar cable and satellite operators
from downgrading any program that also was available over the air for
free. It also would make it difficult to downgrade other programs.</TE>
<TE>   * Recording restrictions. The proposed regulation would allow
consumers to make at least one copy of most programs, with the main
exception being those delivered via pay-per-view and video-on-demand
services. Programs that cannot be copied could still be delayed as
long as 90 minutes by viewers with personal video recorders such as
those made by TiVo Inc., which store programs on a hard drive instead
of videotape.</TE>
<TE>   The deal would let programmers petition the FCC to tighten the
recording restrictions. In addition, approaches to programming based
on new business models could have more restrictive recording rules,
but the FCC would have to put any complaints on a fast track and take
consumers' reasonable expectations into account.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS to Disclose Performance Data</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CalPERS agreed Wednesday to disclose performance information for
private equity investments, a step toward greater openness in
evaluating the financial performance of leveraged buyout and venture
funds.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest
U.S. pension fund with $135 billion invested, will release the
performance data for each of the pension fund's private equity funds,
including the date the investment was made and the profits returned
to the system, CalPERS said.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS, which was sued in October by the San Jose Mercury News,
is one of several state pension funds caught in a clash between
pressure for better financial reporting in the wake of corporate
accounting scandals and private equity firms' requirements for
confidentiality.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS had said on Tuesday that it was considering greater
disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   "Ending this lawsuit frees us to work proactively on developing an
industry standard for private equity reporting that allows us to do
our fiduciary duty and provide maximum transparency," William Crist,
president of CalPERS' board of administration, said.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Olson, attorney for the Mercury News, had no immediate
comment.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS said it will release data for the quarters ended June 30,
Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, 2002, and March 30, 2003. In exchange, the
Mercury News will withdraw all claims, according to the statement.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS has $20 billion committed to private equity investments.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure could put pressure on public institutions to
provide details of private equity performance and lead to
restrictions on investments by state pension systems in the $250
billion of funds managed by U.S. private equity firms.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, CalPERS' investment committee chairman, Michael
Flaherman, said he will join New Mountain Capital Group, a private
equity firm in which CalPERS has a $100-million stake.</TE>
<TE>   Flaherman, 37, will join New York-based New Mountain on Jan. 20
when his previously announced retirement from CalPERS takes effect.</TE>

<HD>CEO in Deal to Acquire Dole Food</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dole Food Co. said late Wednesday that it agreed to a takeover by
Chief Executive David H. Murdock after he raised his original offer
by almost 14%.</LD>
<LD>   Westlake Village-based Dole, the world's biggest producer of fresh
fruits and vegetables, said Murdock agreed to pay $33.50 a share in
cash for the 76% of Dole stock that he and his family don't already
own.</LD>
<LD>   That would be an increase of $4 a share from the $29.50 a share
Murdock offered in September. The total value of the bid, including
Murdock's assumption of Dole's debt, was put at $2.5 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Dole's board had rejected Murdock's initial offer as too low. The
new offer will be submitted to shareholders for approval.</TE>
<TE>   By taking Dole private, the publicity-shy billionaire would no
longer have to worry about Wall Street's view of the company, and
would be free to transfer Dole's earnings and assets among his other
business ventures. For example, he has extensive real estate
holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, 79, has been criticized by some shareholders who say he
has operated the company as a private fiefdom, to his investors'
detriment.</TE>
<TE>   The stock closed at $28.45 Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 24 cents, before the deal was announced.</TE>

<HD>More Pieces Falling Into Place for Downtown Revitalization</HD>
<DH>A residential and retail project at city's core adds a
Ralphs supermarket to its development plans</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, civic leaders have talked about the comeback of downtown
Los Angeles, pointing proudly to such new landmarks as Staples
Center, Disney Hall and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. But
to many, the real proof that the city's core may finally be on the
rebound is a Ralphs supermarket.</LD>
<LD>   The grocery chain is making plans to open a store at 9th and
Flower streets -- part of a massive, 7.2-acre residential and retail
project under construction near Staples Center. The developer of the
site, Hollywood-based CIM Group, said the supermarket should be
opening its doors within two years.</LD>
<LD>   "We're connecting the pieces downtown and creating a community,"
said Avi Shemesh, a founding partner of CIM, which was a major force
behind the revitalization of both Old Pasadena and Santa Monica's
Third Street Promenade.</LD>
<TE>   The project is seen as a pivotal link in the renovation of
downtown L.A., helping bridge the gap between the financial district
and Staples Center. It will cover parts of three blocks and include
1,171 apartments and condominiums slated to be built over the next
several years at a cost of about $220 million.</TE>
<TE>   The first portion of the four-phase, three-year project already is
underway with the revamping of four abandoned Flower Street office
buildings designed by some of Los Angeles' best-known architects. The
Gas Company Lofts, as they will be known, will house 251 apartments
and street-level stores in a complex of buildings dating back to 1925
that once served as the headquarters of Southern California Gas Co.
They are scheduled to be completed next fall.</TE>
<TE>   But the most remarkable thing about the project, in many eyes, is
the luring of a supermarket to the urban center.</TE>
<TE>   "Critical to attracting families and others is the presence of
normal consumer services," said Donald Spivack, deputy administrator
of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. Having a Ralphs
"will be a key element in achieving the goal of creating a 24-hour,
mixed-use community downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Today, directors of the CRA are expected to approve the
environmental impact report for the entire project, along with a
development agreement for the supermarket. If the City Council
follows with final approvals, construction of the Ralphs will begin
in July, according to CIM.</TE>
<TE>   The Albertsons grocery chain also vied for the location. But
Shemesh said CIM chose Ralphs because the company "was there from the
beginning and we knew they would execute."</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs spokesman Terry O'Neil acknowledged that a deal to open a
downtown store is near. "We believe downtown is in dire need of a
modern full-service supermarket," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The pending agreement to bring a supermarket to downtown
culminates at least a dozen years of public and private efforts,
Spivack said. At the same time, the CRA has been working to create
housing and pedestrian activity in the district, known as South Park.</TE>
<TE>   CIM's residential blueprint revolves around the original gas
company building -- a 13-story tower designed in the Romanesque
Revival style by John Parkinson and Donald B. Parkinson, a father-son
team of Los Angeles architects who created such landmarks as City
Hall, Union Station and the Bullocks-Wilshire department store.</TE>
<TE>   Workers converting the structure are preserving 75-year-old
details that include a mother-of-pearl mosaic in the lobby and brass
elevators. "The building has this wonderful quality," said Santa
Monica architect Wade Killefer, whose firm is handling the conversion
to housing. "The key is to not screw it up."</TE>
<TE>   The task extends to reusing the best elements of the three
interconnected additions that Southern California Gas made in 1941,
1952 and 1959. Among them was a Streamline Moderne style building
dreamed up by Robert V. Derrah, who also designed the nautical-themed
Coca Cola plant in Los Angeles and the Crossroads of the World retail
complex in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Another well-known Los Angeles architect, Albert C. Martin &amp;
Associates, designed the last addition in the Corporate International
style. Martin also worked on City Hall and other landmarks, including
the May Co. store on Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty percent of the apartments in the CIM development will be
offered at reduced rent to low-income tenants. Half of those will be
for households with an adjusted income that does not exceed 80% of
the county's annual median, now estimated at $55,100 for a family of
four. The other half will be for households whose income does not
exceed 50% of the county median.</TE>
<TE>   Financing for the project is set to come from a $180-million urban
real estate initiative, which was set up for CIM by pension funds
CalPERS and CalSTRS.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown's residential housing market has accelerated sharply in
the last few years with conversions of historic office buildings, as
well as new construction. But residents have complained of a shortage
of amenities that most city dwellers take for granted. Perhaps the
biggest gripe has been the absence of a grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   Supermarkets operate on narrow margins in a highly competitive
industry and aren't able to pay much rent, said Dean Schwanke, an
analyst at the Urban Land Institute in Washington. It's often
difficult for developers to build large grocery stores in urban
settings that require costly parking structures.</TE>
<TE>   Putting housing above a store makes sense for another reason, too:
No apartment dweller, Schwanke said, "wants to rent on the ground
level."</TE>
<TE>   But retailers do. Merchants slated to be part of the CIM project
include Blockbuster, the International House of Pancakes and other
stores intended to appeal to people who live and work in the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Said Shaul Kuba, another CIM partner: "It's a community shopping
center in an urban center without the sea of parking in front of it."</TE>

<HD>Trade Gap Narrows After Port Lockout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Palmer</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. trade deficit is still expected to widen to a record this
year, despite a narrowing in October caused by a West Coast port
lockout, as weak world growth continues to curb demand for U.S.
exports, analysts said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the October trade gap
narrowed 5.5% to $35.07 billion, the lowest level since March, after
setting a record of $38.09 billion in August.</LD>
<LD>   Ports on the West Coast were closed the last two days of September
and the first eight days of October because of a labor dispute
between port operators and dockworkers.</LD>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said it could not isolate the effect of
the lockout on the monthly trade figures, but analysts said it was a
major, if short-lived, factor.</TE>
<TE>   The goods and service trade deficit for the first 10 months of the
year was a record $350 billion, compared with $301 billion in the
same period last year. A recession that began in March 2001 reduced
demand for imports last year, shrinking the deficit from the record
$379 billion set in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Stronger U.S. economic growth pushed imports steadily higher
through the first eight months of this year, peaking at $121 billion
in August. But imports slipped slightly in September and then tumbled
to $117 billion in October.</TE>
<TE>   The October decline was led by capital goods, which fell $1.4
billion from September, and consumer goods, which slipped $1.3
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers said the latest trade figures were more bad news for
their sector because they showed overseas economies remain weak. The
strong U.S. dollar also makes U.S. goods more expensive, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Exports declined about $800 million in October to $81.93 billion.</TE>

<HD>FERC to Widen Probe of Enron's Ownership of Wind-Power
Plants</HD>
<DH>Review will cover two more partnerships amid allegations
the company masked its ties to the facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators agreed Wednesday to expand their investigation of
allegations that Enron Corp. improperly masked its ownership of
California wind-power plants to get special regulatory breaks and
collect higher rates.</LD>
<LD>   The action by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission came at the
request of Southern California Edison Co. The commission, which
agreed in October to examine the eligibility of three Enron
wind-power partnerships, said Wednesday that it will extend the
review to cover two other partnerships. The five partnerships
together operate a dozen or more of the so-called wind farms in
California.</LD>
<LD>   "Serious allegations have been made that certain Enron-affiliated
wind facilities have not satisfied the ownership criteria" to qualify
the partnership for special status under federal regulations, FERC's
draft decision said.</LD>
<TE>   That special "qualifying facility" status was created to encourage
alternate energy-producing technologies; it is bestowed upon entities
not controlled by utility generators.</TE>
<TE>   Using their qualifying facility designation, the Enron
partnerships were able to charge other companies above-market rates
for their power. In a petition filed with FERC in late October, SoCal
Edison claims it was overcharged by $150 million. It has asked the
regulators to order that money refunded, with interest.</TE>
<TE>   The ownership of the California wind-power partnerships came into
question in the wake of the federal investigation of Enron's
manipulation of the California energy market. Investigators found a
variety of partnerships that were secretly owned by Enron, including
the wind entities now being reviewed by FERC.</TE>
<TE>   Enron was required to divest its ownership in those wind-power
facilities as part of its 1997 purchase of the Portland General
utility. But in its October order, FERC said Enron instead masked its
ownership using the secret partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on FERC's
decision, but said the company "has been and continues to cooperate
with all investigations." In regulatory filings, the Enron owners
"deny that the ownership structure of the facilities is or has been
inconsistent" with the commission's rules, according to FERC's draft
decision.</TE>

<HD>Disney Veteran Litvack Joins L.A. Law Firm</HD>
<DH>One-time vice chairman of the entertainment company will
focus on business litigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Girion</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Walt Disney Co. Vice Chairman Sanford M. Litvack will become a
partner at Quinn Emanuel, a Los Angeles-based law firm that
specializes in business litigation.</LD>
<LD>   Litvack, the former head of the Justice Department's Antitrust
Division, worked at Disney from 1991 to 2001, first as general
counsel, then chief of corporate operations and later as vice
chairman. He left Disney to return to the Dewey Ballantine law firm,
where he chaired the complex litigation department.</LD>
<LD>   Litvack said he decided to leave that firm for Quinn, Emanuel,
Urquhart, Oliver &amp; Hedges because he wanted to spend more time trying
cases. The 190-lawyer firm describes itself as the largest in the
United States devoted solely to litigation and boasts of winning 90%
of the more than 650 cases its lawyers have taken to trial.</LD>
<TE>   "Unlike most traditional New York firms, where the litigation
department is simply a part of a larger organization, at Quinn
Emanuel, the sole focus is on business litigation -- with a heavy
emphasis on trial work," Litvack said. "What I enjoy most is being in
a courtroom."</TE>
<TE>   Litvack, 66, makes his home in Los Angeles but will try cases
nationwide. He is expected to help the firm heighten its profile in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   "One trend you are seeing right now is a lot more litigation over
securities problems -- the Enron, WorldCom accounting problems," said
managing partner John B. Quinn. "I think there is going to be more
litigation related to major corporate governance issues, and I think
he is uniquely qualified to do that kind of work."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said Litvack's unusual career path, including his major
roles in government and at a Fortune 50 company, set him apart from
most lawyers. Litvack also serves on the audit committees of the
boards of Hewlett-Packard Co. and PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "You are talking about a very unique individual," Quinn said.
"There are few lawyers of his stature in corporate America."</TE>

<HD>Judge May Exclude J.P. Morgan E-Mails</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Voreacos</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>E-mails from J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s vice chairman describing
transactions as "disguised loans" are so "explosive," a federal judge
said, that he might exclude them at a fraud trial involving 11
insurers.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff is weighing whether to let jurors
review e-mails from Donald Layton in a lawsuit filed by J.P. Morgan
against insurers seeking to force them to pay $1 billion on surety
bonds backing gas and oil transactions involving Enron Corp. The
insurers refused to pay after Enron's collapse, saying the bank
masked loans to Enron as oil and gas trades involving an offshore
entity.</LD>
<LD>   Rakoff said Tuesday that he was leaning against admitting the
e-mails because Layton didn't write them about transactions at issue
in the trial. Rather, the e-mails described Layton's 1999 review of
internal accounting when the bank advanced cash in certain
commodities or equities derivative transactions.</LD>
<TE>   "What makes this a close call is that the use of the term
'disguised loans' is an explosive one in the context of this case,"
Rakoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Layton testified at the hearing, where the contents of several of
the e-mails were revealed. He said he began reviewing how the bank
recorded certain transactions after learning about a complicated
equities derivative in Hong Kong that he thought was handled
improperly.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making disguised loans, usually buried in commodities or
equities derivatives," Layton wrote in an e-mail. "They are
understood to be disguised loans and approved as such. But I am
queasy about the process."</TE>
<TE>   In another e-mail, Layton said the phrase "disguised loans" was "a
pejorative phrase even if generally accurate." He suggested that a
more accurate phrase would be "derivatives-based fundings."</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Layton said none of the 1999 e-mails referred to
transactions involving Enron, which sold oil and gas to a
bank-sponsored entity, Mahonia Ltd. He said he used the phrase
"disguised loans" as a colloquial expression to refer to cash
disbursed upfront in certain commodities transactions.</TE>
<TE>   He said he got e-mails from a bank employee in late 1998
describing the Enron transactions, although he didn't recall them
when he wrote his e-mails six months later. He said he learned of the
Enron-Mahonia transactions only around the time of the energy
trader's bankruptcy filing in December 2001.</TE>

<HD>Shares Fall on Earnings Warnings, War Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slumped anew Wednesday amid fresh corporate earnings warnings
and continuing war jitters.</LD>
<LD>   Oil and gold prices rose again, and some investors sought safety
in Treasury securities.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, earnings warnings from firms including Bank of New
York and Blockbuster helped drive the Dow Jones industrial average
down 88.04 points, or 1%, to 8,447.35. It was the index's ninth loss
in 13 sessions.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index dropped 30.54 points, or 2.2%, to
1,361.51, and falling stocks outnumbered rising issues by about 2 to
1 on that market and on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of New York shares slid $4.11 to $22.39 after it said
fourth-quarter earnings would be cut by higher-than-expected loan
losses. Blockbuster plunged $6.27 to $13.13 after the company said
movie rental sales have been disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Those announcements, as well as chip maker Micron Technology's
report of a wider-than-expected quarterly loss, may have caused more
investors to rein in their expectations for profit growth in general
in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   "Fourth-quarter earnings expectations were too high, and 2003
earnings expectations were too high," Michael Kenneally, chief
investment officer at Banc of America Capital Management, told
Bloomberg News. "They have to come back to earth."</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the market also has been dogged by rising concerns
about a potential U.S.-Iraq conflict. White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said Wednesday that there were serious omissions and
problems with Iraq's weapons declaration as President Bush pondered
the administration's next move.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil prices rose sharply on the war worries as well as civil
strife in Venezuela, a major producer. Near-term oil futures in New
York rose 34 cents to $30.44 a barrel after trading at an 11-week
high of $31.25.</TE>
<TE>   Rising fear levels pushed some investors into Treasury securities,
driving yields lower. The 10-year T-note yield fell to 4.04% from
4.12% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Gold also continued to gain as investors looked for a safe haven.
January gold futures in New York surged $4.70 to $342.20 an ounce, a
5 1/2-year high.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dollar halted its recent slide against the euro,
though it lost modest ground against other currencies, including the
yen.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Micron shares plummeted $3.06 to $10.22, dragging other chip
stocks lower. Intel  fell 76 cents to $17.13, National Semiconductor
slid $1.35 to $15.75, and Broadcom was down $1.09 to $15.90.</TE>
<TE>   But elsewhere in the tech sector, Oracle's fiscal second-quarter
profit, reported after regular trading ended, was better than
expected. The stock fell 39 cents to $10.63 in regular trading, then
rose to $11.35 after hours.</TE>
<TE>   * Bank shares fell with Bank of New York. Northern Trust dropped
$2.02 to $34.50, Bank One lost $1.40 to $36.17, and FleetBoston was
down 97 cents to $24.94.</TE>
<TE>   * Early today in Tokyo the Nikkei 225 index fell 1.1% to 8,256,
below the 19-year closing low of 8,303 set Nov. 14.</TE>

companies are starting to buy business software again.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Database software giant Oracle Corp. on Wednesday posted quarterly
earnings and sales that beat its own cautious forecasts, as the
company said it believes the worst is over.</LD>
<LD>   For its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30, Redwood Shores,
Calif.-based Oracle posted net income of $535 million, or 10 cents a
share, down 2.6% from $549 million, or 10 cents a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Total revenue slipped to $2.31 billion from $2.38 billion a year
earlier, but was higher than the company's previous guidance as
international business, excluding that in Japan, improved.</LD>
<TE>   "We think the quarter we're in now will be better than the quarter
we just finished. We'll show some top-line growth this quarter,"
Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley was equally upbeat: "We
are more optimistic right now than we've ever been since the industry
slumped two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle said it expects earnings of 9 cents to 10 cents a share in
the current quarter, versus 9 cents a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares rose to $11.35 in after-hours trading,
following the earnings report. In regular trading they had fallen 39
cents to $10.63 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "They did even better than people were hoping," said JMP
Securities analyst Pat Walravens.</TE>
<TE>   Sales from software license updates and product support contracts
rose 8% to $954 million, while new licensing revenue was down 7% to
$765 million and services revenue was down 11% to $590 million.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle's report may signal that companies are starting to buy
business software again after a slump that's lasted almost two years,
investors said. Database software is used to store and sort
information.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty percent of this story is database. If they can keep
growing the database side of the business, that gives them quite a
bit of leeway" to fix weaker sales in applications software,
Walravens said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of applications, used to manage tasks such as accounting and
customer relations, fell 34% to $108.1 million in the quarter, a
steeper decline than in the first quarter, when they fell 24%.</TE>

<HD>Palm Turns a Profit but Revenue Slides</HD>
<DH>Cost cutting and the introduction of new hand-held devices
power the turnaround.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Selway</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>MILPITAS</DL>
<LD>MILPITAS, Calif. -- Palm Inc., the world's largest maker of hand-held
computers, on Wednesday reported a second-quarter net income of $3.52
million as it cut costs to achieve its second profit in two years,
even as sales fell.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings were 12 cents a share compared with a loss of $25.2
million, or 89 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Shares rose
13% on the news, even though sales fell 8.8% to $264.9 million in the
quarter ended Nov. 29 from $290.6 million a year before.</LD>
<LD>   Palm lowered marketing and other expenses, as rivals including
Handspring Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Sony Corp. capture a greater
share of the dwindling market for hand-held computers. Palm has tried
to boost sales with higher-priced models aimed at businesses and the
$99 Zire, a machine targeted at first-time users.</LD>
<TE>   "The hand-held industry is declining less rapidly now than it has
over the last several quarters," Eric Benhamou, Palm's chairman and
chief executive, said in a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Palm is seeing "strong acceptance" of its new products during
holiday sales, Benhamou said.</TE>
<TE>   Palm shares rose $2.12 to $18.85 in after-hours trading after the
results were released. The shares fell 52 cents to $16.73 in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>
<TE>   The computer maker's results exceeded the company's earlier
expectations. In September, Palm said it would have a "small loss" on
sales of $245 million to $265 million for the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The results have been adjusted to reflect a reduction in the
number of shares outstanding from a reverse stock split approved in
October. Investors received one share for every 20 they owned.</TE>
<TE>   Palm's stock market value, which exceeded that of Ford Motor Co.
on the first day of trading in March 2000, has declined by more than
$15 billion over the last two years, standing at $485 million by the
close of the regular trading day.</TE>

<HD>Quiksilver Rides High on Wave of Demand for Surf Wear</HD>
<DH>The apparel maker says its fiscal fourth-quarter net income
quintupled, and its outlook for next year is rosy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signaling the growing popularity of surf wear worldwide, Quiksilver
Inc. said Wednesday that earnings quintupled in its fiscal fourth
quarter as young shoppers snapped up its apparel, including the
popular Roxy brand for girls.</LD>
<LD>   In a particularly upbeat conference call with analysts, company
executives said Huntington Beach-based Quiksilver has "excellent
momentum" moving into 2003, with spring bookings up 16% compared with
last year. The company also said it plans to open 30 stores and
launch a new line of footwear for men.</LD>
<LD>   "In nearly every way, this was an excellent year for our company,"
Chief Executive Robert B. McKnight told analysts.</LD>
<TE>   Earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 31 were $12.2 million, or 49
cents a share, compared with $2.4 million, or 10 cents a share, in
the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   In a consensus, analysts had expected earnings of 43 cents a
share, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Sales rose nearly 15% to about $195 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, earnings rose 34.2% to nearly $37.6 million, or
$1.54 a share, compared with $28 million, or $1.17, in 2001. Analysts
were expecting $1.47.</TE>
<TE>   For 2003, Quiksilver reiterated earlier raised earnings
expectations of $1.75 to $1.79. Analysts say Quiksilver is typically
conservative with its earnings predictions, leaving room to "beat the
numbers," as one of them put it.</TE>
<TE>   The company said its brands sold well during the back-to-school
season and the strong sales have continued into the holiday shopping
season.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver's strong performance shows that the surfing lifestyle
has become "ingrained in the masses," said Jeffrey Klinefelter, an
analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no longer a niche," he said. "It's not about the surf trend
that comes around every three to five years. This is about a
board-sport lifestyle that is part of the culture."</TE>
<TE>   In another indicator of the mushrooming appeal of clothes that
reflect the laid-back Southern California lifestyle, Anaheim-based
retailer Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. -- which sells many of
the brands made by local surf wear companies -- is the second
most-popular specialty retailer among teens, behind New Albany,
Ohio-based Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., said Klinefelter, who conducted a
survey of young shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at PacSun stores account for about 7% of Quiksilver's
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Other surf wear companies also are reporting strong spring
bookings compared with last year, said Mitch Kummetz, an analyst with
Wedbush Morgan Securities.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's across the board for that group," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver also said it signed this year's British Open champion,
Ernie Els, to endorse its Fidra Golf apparel line in a five-year
deal.</TE>
<TE>   The golf brand, launched in 2000, is expected to generate sales of
$5 million to $7 million next year, up from $3 million to $3.5
million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver said its new men's shoe line will ship to stores for
next year's holiday season. It probably will have about 12 styles,
the company said. Currently, Quiksilver sells only thong sandals for
men but has a wider range of shoes for girls and women.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver's stock, which is up 59% this year, fell 59 cents
Wednesday to $27.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. The earnings
announcement came after the market closed.</TE>

<HD>Judge Slashes Huge Award in Smoking Case</HD>
<DH>Record $28-billion verdict by a Los Angeles jury to a lung
cancer sufferer is trimmed to $28 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge Wednesday slashed a record punitive damages
verdict against Philip Morris Cos. to $28 million, a hefty sum but a
shadow of the $28 billion originally ordered by the jury.</LD>
<LD>   Declaring the jury award to 64-year-old Betty Bullock, a longtime
smoker with lung and liver cancer, "legally excessive," Superior
Court Judge Warren L. Ettinger ruled that $28 million "is a
reasonable sum to be awarded against Philip Morris in these
circumstances."</LD>
<LD>   But in his seven-page ruling, Ettinger denied two other motions by
Philip Morris: a request to either order a new trial or to discard
the jury's verdict and declare the company not liable.</LD>
<TE>   In rejecting the motions, Ettinger said Philip Morris had mounted
almost no defense to claims that it had conspired with other
cigarette makers to conceal the risks and addictiveness of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   "During the course of the trial, the plaintiff called world-famous
experts who established that it had been known since the 1950s that
cigarette smoke caused lung cancer; that nicotine was a highly
addictive drug; and that executives of Philip Morris were aware of
these facts," the ruling said.</TE>
<TE>   "Plaintiff also proved that with this knowledge, Philip Morris
constantly lied to its customers. Their executives continued on a
course claiming there was 'no certainty' that their product caused
disease or was addictive," Ettinger wrote. "They made such claims to
the public, to the Congress and to the media.... Philip Morris
offered NO EVIDENCE refuting or denying any of these facts."</TE>
<TE>   William S. Ohlemeyer, Philip Morris vice president and associate
general counsel, said the company would appeal because the verdict
was "inconsistent with the facts and the law that should have
governed this case." In seeking a new trial, Philip Morris had
claimed there was no evidence that Bullock relied on any
misrepresentations by the company, which it said was a necessary
ingredient in proving fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock, of Newport Beach, has the option of seeking a new trial
solely on punitive damages or consenting to the reduced award by Dec.
27, the ruling said.</TE>
<TE>   Her Lawyer, Michael Piuze, said he and Bullock had yet to confer
on whether to accept the award. But he said he was "extremely
disappointed in the magnitude" of the reduction.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a real punishment for Philip Morris," Piuze said.</TE>
<TE>   Legal observers said the reduction was a foregone conclusion
because the punitive award was 33,000 times the $850,000 in
compensatory damages given Bullock for economic losses, medical
expenses and pain and suffering. Without explaining how he got there,
Ettinger allowed one one-thousandth of the award to stand. The award
had been the largest ever given to an individual plaintiff in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   Ettinger had instructed the jury that punitive damages should be
sufficient to deter future misconduct but also must bear some
reasonable relationship to the compensatory damages awarded to a
plaintiff. He acknowledged there is "no bright-line rule" for
deciding when a punitive award is excessive, but cited a U.S. Supreme
Court case in which justices said a 500-1 ratio must "raise a
suspicious judicial eyebrow."</TE>
<TE>   Jury forewoman Jessica Gelson said she was disappointed by the
size of the reduction. "We took days to deliberate and come to that
number, and it was based very much on jury instructions."</TE>
<TE>   But another juror, Jose Farinas, reacted philosophically:  "We did
our job, and the judge is doing his job, and that's how the legal
system works."</TE>
<TE>   The Bullock case was the tobacco industry's fourth straight loss
in California at the hands of an individual smoker and, along with
two losses in Oregon, its sixth straight West Coast defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Ettinger's ruling, cigarette makers Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. face $362 million in damage awards in the
six cases. The other five are in various stages of appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Ettinger's ruling came after the close of trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. Shares of New York-based Philip Morris rose 52 cents
to $41.85 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi to Sell Stake in EchoStar at a Loss</HD>
<DH>The $1.07-billion sale is another step in French company's
plan to shed about $16billion in assets through next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing its retreat from the global media arena, Vivendi Universal
on Wednesday said it would sell back its 10% stake in satellite TV
company EchoStar Communications Corp. for $1.07 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The sale, set to close Monday, is about $430 million less than
what the French conglomerate paid for the stake in January during
aggressive U.S. media expansion led by former Chief Executive
Jean-Marie Messier that also netted Universal's movie studio, theme
parks and music labels.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi had believed the EchoStar purchase would help build U.S.
distribution for its television shows and films.</LD>
<TE>   But that backfired when investors rejected the company's overall
strategy, sending Vivendi's stock tumbling 70% this year and forcing
the ouster of Messier.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar intended to use the
cash to help fund its proposed merger with DirecTV parent, El
Segundo-based Hughes Electronics Corp. But EchoStar scrapped those
plans last week amid regulatory hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi is shedding its stake in EchoStar as part of CEO Jean-Rene
Fourtou's plan to sell about $16 billion in assets through next year
and lower Vivendi's huge debts. Other sales this year have included
Boston publisher Houghton-Mifflin and European pay TV operations.
Vivendi also is selling its remaining 40% stake in its water utility
business.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Wednesday, Vivendi disclosed that it was
taking legal action against a minority shareholder group whose
complaints about alleged accounting irregularities have triggered a
criminal probe into the company.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said the French shareholders' group, APPAC, made false
statements about Vivendi after a police raid at the company's Paris
headquarters last week.</TE>
<TE>   Those comments, Vivendi said in a statement, included false claims
that the company was about to be declared insolvent and had filed at
least seven different balance sheets.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi Universal considers it has a duty to take legal action in
the interests of shareholders and employees, who should not be
victims of biased information," the company said.</TE>
<TE>   APPAC filed a complaint in July alleging that Vivendi had issued
false statements about its finances. The complaint prompted a
criminal probe that has triggered searches of homes owned by Messier
and other former executives. Four investigations are underway in
France and the U.S. in connection with Vivendi's financial
disclosures.</TE>

<HD>Warner's Star Vehicles Sputter at the Theaters</HD>
<DH>A spate of films has done poorly this year. Chief regrets
not releasing more 'event pictures.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Cieply</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warner Bros. will play matchmaker between Sandra Bullock and Hugh
Grant on Friday with the debut of its romantic comedy "Two Weeks
Notice."</LD>
<LD>   With that, the studio may want to give its own love affair with
movie stars a rest.</LD>
<LD>   In the last year, Warner has been wrestling with an unusual
concentration of relatively high-cost, and often underperforming,
star vehicles. Among them: two previous pictures from Bullock, three
from Robert De Niro and two -- both flops -- from Eddie Murphy.</LD>
<TE>   The pileup has taken the edge off an otherwise good year for AOL
Time Warner's film unit and may be one of the last such star-studded
schedules in a changing Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent star picture to hit for Warner, long known as a
haven for big-name talent, was last December's "Ocean's Eleven." The
ensemble piece featured George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and
Julia Roberts and took in $183.4 million in U.S. ticket sales. Since
then, the studio -- which ranks third at the box office with $980
million this year, 35% less than front-runner Sony Pictures -- has
grabbed the largest share of its revenue from a pair of hits without
major stars: "Scooby-Doo" and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Warner has struggled with a dozen star-driven films
whose performance can best be described as "soft and softer." The
best of them has been Bullock's "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood," which stopped well shy of blockbuster status with $69.6
million in ticket sales, though it was based on a pair of bestselling
books.</TE>
<TE>   That was stellar compared with Arnold Schwarzenegger's big-budget
bomb "Collateral Damage," which raked in just $40 million, and Clint
Eastwood's "Blood Work," with $26 million -- not to mention Murphy's
"The Adventures of Pluto Nash," which cost more than $100 million to
make and market and took in just $4 million at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   "What winds up on the release schedule is kind of organic and not
pursuant to any overall plan," said Warner President and Chief
Operating Officer Alan Horn. "Nobody would say, 'Let's do three
movies with De Niro or two with Eddie Murphy.' "</TE>
<TE>   Generally, Horn said, the studio aims for a healthy mix of films
featuring as many as five "event pictures" -- those with virtually
guaranteed audience appeal because of their special effects,
well-known characters or perfect casting.</TE>
<TE>   But the normal hazards of film packaging, he said, have become
even trickier in the last couple of years because of Warner's policy
of reducing risk by sharing its slate with partners. Under this
arrangement, Warner may handle a film's distribution but leave all
the creative decisions to its partner -- including the choosing of
the stars.</TE>
<TE>   One partner, Alcon Entertainment, produced "Insomnia" with Al
Pacino and Robin Williams, which became the studio's second-best star
vehicle of the year, posting a relatively modest $67 million in
ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   The film opened on the heels of "Death to Smoochy," another
Williams vehicle, in which Warner joined Senator, Film Four and other
producers. That one generated just $8 million at the domestic box
office. Yet another partner, Franchise Pictures, delivered "City by
the Sea," which was one of the studio's three De Niro films. It
opened three months before the star's "Analyze That" and took in just
$22 million at the box office, although it cost a reported $60
million to produce.</TE>
<TE>   Under a new arrangement, Franchise now works more closely with
executives before giving the green light to pictures for distribution
by Warner, Horn said.</TE>
<TE>   Warner's confluence of big-star films this year is particularly
unusual in an era when several competitors have been trying to
diminish their reliance on expensive talent in favor of "branded"
family fare such as Disney's "Lilo &amp; Stitch," effects-driven
spectacles such as Sony's "Spider-Man" or niche pictures with
breakout potential, including MGM's "Barbershop."</TE>
<TE>   Because of sharply rising talent costs over the last decade, the
judicious use of stars has become one of the most delicate challenges
facing film executives.</TE>
<TE>   The familiar faces on magazine covers are often a good bet to fill
theater seats on an opening weekend. But an actress like Bullock may
get $18 million a picture, and Schwarzenegger and others may top $20
million.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several years, many of the biggest hits have been
light on star power. Through the end of November, for instance, six
of the 10 films with the highest ticket sales in 2002 had no
superstars. The six were "Spider-Man," "The Lord of the Rings," "Star
Wars: Episode II," "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," "Harry Potter and the
Chamber of Secrets" and "Ice Age."</TE>
<TE>   Some close observers agree that Warner's offerings, to some
extent, simply reflect the breaks of the movie game. "It all depends
on what comes together," said Castle Rock Entertainment Chairman
Martin Shafer. His company, also owned by AOL Time Warner, produced
several Warner-distributed films, including "Two Weeks Notice." It
also made Bullock's "Murder by Numbers" and Jim Carrey's "The
Majestic," both of which did poorly at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, detect traces of a talent-friendly culture
perfected by late Warner Chairman Steve Ross. "It's a little bit of
the old Warner style: 'Let's just make a movie with movie stars,' "
said one top Hollywood film agent.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner doesn't separately report financial results for
Warner Bros. Horn said the studio has been quite profitable for the
year, thanks not only to the success of the "Harry Potter" series but
also to the partnership arrangements, which gave the company healthy
distribution fees on even some of the weakest films on its slate.</TE>
<TE>   With only "Harry Potter" and "Scooby-Doo" to point to, the Warner
president said his only regret is that the studio's desire to produce
multiple event films "was not reflected very strongly, frankly, in
this year, '02."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the all-star traffic jam, and particularly the multiple
appearances by stars, caused timing and marketing headaches. Perhaps
the worst occurred when the studio delayed Murphy's "Pluto Nash" to
keep it from tripping over "Showtime," another Murphy picture, only
to have the films perform poorly amid bad fan buzz about the
scheduling change.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, Warner will largely avoid those troubling clusters. So
far, its 2003 schedule includes only eight big-star movies, including
"Terminator 3" with Schwarzenegger, "The Last Samurai" with Tom
Cruise and "Matchstick Men" with Nicolas Cage. There also are a pair
of "The Matrix" sequels, spaced six months apart, with Keanu Reeves.</TE>
<TE>   At a Warner Bros. retreat last week, in fact, the talk was more
about finding next-wave filmmakers than about the care and feeding of
movie stars.</TE>
<TE>   According to one person familiar with the retreat, film production
chief Jeff Robinov, who assumed his post after Lorenzo di Bonaventura
resigned this year, said he believed the studio had its "franchises"
covered for the moment, with future versions of "The Matrix,"
"Superman," "Looney Tunes" and other films driven more by branding
and concept than star power.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us got into this business to be creative," Robinov told
his staff. "So let's find out who the next writer, director and even
producer is going to be."</TE>

<HD>Firms, Regulators May Be Near Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Government regulators and Wall Street investment banks are nearing
agreement on a comprehensive settlement of probes into tainted stock
research and could announce a tentative deal within the next few
days, a source close to the matter said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators have engaged in feverish negotiations this week with a
handful of brokerage firms that had been reluctant to pay the
penalties sought by regulators. Some of the recalcitrant firms have
altered their positions in recent days, increasing the chances that
an overall accord could be unveiled soon.</LD>
<LD>   The regulators and a dozen firms are negotiating a "global"
settlement that would resolve state and federal probes of allegedly
biased stock research.</LD>
<TE>   The deal would call for the companies to pay a collective $1
billion in fines and to implement a series of reforms. In return,
regulators would drop their investigations and forgo the filing of
legal cases.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have strong incentives to reach a deal. The firms
want to put a public-relations debacle behind them, and regulators
want to quickly finish the time-consuming probes.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators recently have been nearing agreement with several major
firms, such as Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston. But a
band of roughly half a dozen mid-tier firms, including Lehman Bros.
Holdings and UBS Warburg, had been reluctant to pay the roughly $50
million in fines asked of them, sources have said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those six firms have raised their settlement offers in the
last few days. That came after regulators warned late last week that
they would pursue investigations aggressively if the brokerages did
not become more accommodating.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain whether all 12 firms could reach accords with
regulators. An announcement could say that regulators have reached
agreements in principle with a majority of companies, but that a
handful of others are still holding out, the source said.</TE>

<HD>Venezuela Crisis Has Superpower in a Bind</HD>
<DH>U.S. needs the oil but is hampered by missteps against the
Chavez regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frida Ghitis</AU>
<BD>Frida Ghitis is author of "The End of Revolution: A
Changing World in the Age of Live Television" (Algora Publishing,
2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is straining to find the right tone in its
approach to the growing crisis in Venezuela. One day White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer says the U.S. would like to see new
presidential elections; the next day, it's a referendum.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever it is, Fleischer emphasizes that it ought to happen
democratically, within "the confines of the constitution of
Venezuela."</LD>
<LD>   However, at a time when Washington can least afford to see oil
production disrupted, few people in Latin America believe the U.S.
claim that it stands for democratic rule. Washington's influence in
Venezuela's crisis has been deeply eroded by its own actions.</LD>
<TE>   During normal times, the U.S. imports 14% of its oil from the
South American nation. But these are not normal times. The Venezuelan
oil industry is practically paralyzed by a nationwide strike by
opponents of President Hugo Chavez. The U.S. is poised for a possible
war in Iraq, which could disrupt oil supplies in the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   From Washington's perspective, the timing of the troubles in
Caracas could hardly be worse. Venezuelans are passionately divided;
though millions of Chavez's opponents want him out of office,
millions of his supporters -- many of them armed civilians -- say
they will do what it takes to keep him in power. The ingredients for
a disastrous civil war are in place.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. would like to defuse the situation, but it is reaping
what it sowed in April, when Washington spectacularly mishandled the
Venezuelan crisis. It proclaimed support for the overthrow of the
controversial, but nonetheless democratically elected, Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Like many in Washington, Latin American leaders would like to see
the Chavez era end. But the region has struggled over the last two
decades to create and strengthen democratic institutions. That's why
when a bungled coup removed Chavez from power for 48 hours, Latin
American governments quickly spoke out against what was a flagrant
violation of democratic principles.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, however, rushed to celebrate, blamed Chavez for his
own fate and accepted the coup plotters' false assertion that the
president had resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the region accused Washington of involvement with the
coup. Administration officials offered conflicting accounts of
meetings with the leaders of the anti-Chavez movement. Some said U.S.
authorities had offered tacit support for the forceful removal of the
president; others maintained that the U.S. had urged the opposition
to work through constitutional means.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. would be overjoyed if Chavez left office. The former
paratrooper has been a burr under Washington's saddle. The nation
that was once a reliable and friendly supplier of oil has become a
source of constant worry since Chavez took office four year ago.</TE>
<TE>   His inflammatory leftist rhetoric has been consistently
anti-American. He accused the U.S., in attacking the Taliban, of
committing a crime as great as that of Sept. 11. He has successfully
pushed for OPEC to control production and thus push oil prices
higher.</TE>
<TE>   To rally OPEC unity he has visited Moammar Kadafi in Libya, Saddam
Hussein in Baghdad, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran and Fidel
Castro -- his close personal friend -- in Havana.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only Washington that dislikes Chavez. His sympathy for
Colombia's leftist guerrillas has caused friction with the
neighboring country, and his friendship with Castro has worried many
in the hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   But nowhere is the displeasure more intense than among Chavez's
own people.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who once tried to take power through a coup, has enraged
middle- and upper-class Venezuelans with inflammatory populist
rhetoric and political moves that concentrate power in his own hands.
During his tenure, the poverty that already affected a majority of
Venezuelans has become even more pervasive. Yet many of the poor, who
see him as one of them, revere him.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, events in Venezuela may have more power to influence
Washington's actions than vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   If the two-week anti-Chavez strike that has crippled Venezuela's
oil production does not end soon, Washington will find it very
difficult to launch a war in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   After marching out of step with the rest of the hemisphere in
April, Washington is now offering its support to the mediation
efforts of the Organization of American States and hoping for the
sake of its oil supply and its Iraq plans that these efforts will
succeed. The lesson once again is that the great superpower is not
all-powerful.</TE>

<DH>If war with Iraq is inevitable, let it begin sooner rather
than later</DH>

<AU>Martin Indyk and Kenneth M. Pollack</AU>
<BD>Martin Indyk, a former assistant secretary of State and
ambassador to Israel in the Clinton administration, is director of
the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.
Kenneth M. Pollack, director of research at the center, is a former
CIA analyst and author of "The Threatening Storm: The Case for
Invading Iraq" (Random House, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saddam Hussein has failed to come clean. His denial of possessing any
weapons of mass destruction makes that clear, even though the experts
have not completed their review of Iraq's weapons declaration.</LD>
<LD>   As former U.S. government officials who had access to the most
sensitive U.S. intelligence on Iraq, we are well aware of Iraq's
continued efforts to retain and enhance its weapons capabilities.
Even unclassified sources have shown that Hussein has a lot of
explaining to do. Thousands of tons of precursor chemicals for
chemical warfare agents, thousands of liters of biological warfare
agents and hundreds of munitions remain unaccounted for. Nor has Iraq
bothered to explain other evidence of its cheating, such as the
inspectors' discovery of prohibited Russian missile gyroscopes hidden
in a river and a log book that showed that Iraq used far fewer
chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war than it had claimed,
thereby leaving a large gap between the chemical munitions it was
known to possess and those that had been used or destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   Given that Hussein has chosen not to use his last chance to
disarm, how should the United States respond?</LD>
<TE>   One approach would be to allow the inspections to play out for a
few more months in the hope that the inspectors could catch the
Iraqis in additional lies or that interviews of Iraqi scientists
could lead the inspectors to some of Hussein's hidden stash. The hope
would be that such additional evidence would persuade more countries
to participate in a war coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Alternately, the U.S. could use the false Iraqi declaration as the
cause for war. This would not require the U.S. to declare Iraq in
material breach now and show its hand prematurely. The U.S. military
is not quite ready for war, nor has U.S. diplomacy nailed down
support from all the countries that should be part of a coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the Bush administration could take the time it needs to
"study" the Iraqi declaration, discussing its falsehoods and
fabrications with allied governments until it has lined up all the
necessary political and military ducks. Once the best case has been
made and the preparations completed (probably in a few weeks),
President Bush could announce that, in accordance with United Nations
Resolution 1441, we and our allies have concluded that Iraq is in
material breach of the 1991 cease-fire resolution and therefore the
U.S. will lead a coalition to disarm Iraq by force.</TE>
<TE>   If there must be war, this is the best way. The problem with
allowing the inspections to play themselves out is that it is a
policy based on hope, and as Secretary of State Colin Powell is fond
of saying, "hope is not a plan."</TE>
<TE>   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and International Atomic
Energy Agency Director General Mohammed Baradei have repeatedly
resisted U.S. efforts to direct their activities and demurred from
exercising the more aggressive powers that the U.N. resolution allows
them because their interest lies in encouraging Iraqi cooperation,
not serving as the trigger for a war.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, neither the U.S. intelligence community nor the
inspectors have or are likely to come into possession of the
necessary intelligence that would uncover Iraq's prohibited weaponry
or production facilities through this process. This has been our
problem since the mid-1990s: We have plenty of intelligence that Iraq
has prohibited items, but no reliable indications of where they are
hidden. Spiriting Iraqi scientists out of the country might help, but
some are likely to be missing, others unwilling to leave, and the
rest might fear for loved ones left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than pressuring Blix to pursue an unworkable approach, the
Bush administration's purposes would be better served by publishing
the large amount of information that has already been collected from
earlier defections of Iraqi scientists, even in sanitized form. Their
evidence was always the most valuable intelligence we were able to
collect.</TE>
<TE>   There is real risk in allowing the inspections to run on
indefinitely. The longer the inspections go on and find nothing, the
harder it will be for the U.S. to build a coalition when we finally
decide to take action.</TE>
<TE>   War must always be the last resort, and certainly there is more
preparatory work to be done to minimize its risks and costs. But
Hussein has just made it clear again that the only way to effectively
disarm his regime is to overthrow it.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the president with a choice between war sooner and war
later.</TE>
<TE>   Indefinite inspections will only make the inevitable more
difficult.</TE>

<HD>Could Today's Gangbangers Be Tomorrow's Heroes?</HD>
<DH>Just like the Irish, impoverished can make it with help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Luis J. Rodriguez</AU>
<BD>Luis J. Rodriguez is the author of "Hearts and Hands:
Creating Community in Violent Times"(Seven Stories Press, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"America was born in the streets." That's what an ad says about
"Gangs of New York," a film scheduled for release this week. I can't
comment on the film, but I will say something about those gangs: They
were some of the most brutal thieves and murderers this country has
ever known.</LD>
<LD>   Read Herbert Asbury's book of the same name. It's not fiction,
although Asbury was known to sensationalize. The facts speak for
themselves: Some of the worst gang riots in U.S. history occurred in
the late 1850s and early 1860s in the tenement slums of lower
Manhattan. The weeklong Dead Rabbits Riot of 1857 pitted a mostly
Irish immigrant gang against the so-called Bowery Boys, resulting in
more than 100 casualties, a dozen killed. The 1863 Draft Riots, also
centered in the Irish immigrant community and its gangs, overshadowed
that when 1,000 to 2,000 died.</LD>
<LD>   Many leaders, organizers and writers found something redeeming in
these "angels with dirty faces," and rightfully so. By the beginning
of the 20th century, these gangs had pretty much disappeared.</LD>
<TE>   How did this happen? This is something we should explore,
particularly in the wake of L.A. Police Chief William Bratton's
announcement of a "war" against L.A. gangs.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, massive efforts were directed at the root of Irish
and other European immigrant poverty and second-class citizenry. The
end of the 19th century saw the first settlement houses in cities
like Chicago and New York. Chicago social activist Jane Addams helped
create the first juvenile court system to alleviate the terrible
conditions under which impoverished immigrant youth were held in
squalid adult prisons. The police became better organized, but the
real force for change was the social and political resources brought
to bear, leading to the empowerment, participation and obtaining of
social status for many immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   In a generation or two, many of them were running cities, police
forces and courts. As the most famous lawyer of the time, Clarence
Darrow, once stated: "It's easy to see how to do away with what we
call crime. It can be done by giving the people a chance to live."</TE>
<TE>   Yet today, when gang violence has become widespread and
technologically advanced, politicians and much of the media continue
to bank on what hasn't worked in more than 100 years: more police and
more prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Very little is being done about the growing poverty in L.A.
County. Moreover, we're seeing the dismantling of what social safety
nets once existed and the slashing of educational and vocational
opportunities where they're most needed.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't give people a chance to live, you will have more
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, we'll get increased police presence, curfew laws or graffiti
abatement strategies, but what about meaningful work and skills
development? What about the need for mentors, teachers and elders?
What about community-based activities? What about art, principled
relationships and living out one's calling?</TE>
<TE>   In other words, what about doing all that's possible so children
and teens can live full and complete lives?</TE>
<TE>   In drug and alcohol recovery programs, insanity is defined as
doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different
result. Though many young people are caught up in the madness, many
of the adults who can do something about this appear insane in their
response. An improved police force may help lower the crime rate
briefly, but if the root causes aren't addressed, these rates will
rise again -- guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to look beyond ourselves and immediate results.
It's a revolutionary thing to imagine beyond our own lives.</TE>
<TE>   You want to stop gangs? Find out what's vital in the lives of
young people and their communities. Help provide them the necessary
regenerative ground, tools and doorways. Many of us are tired of the
headline-grabbing "wars" -- the War on Poverty, the War on Drugs and
countless wars on gangs. In the end, we've only seen more poverty,
more drugs and more gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Let's declare peace and teach respect. Let's create a lasting
basis for trust and eradicate the conditions that have given rise to
gangs from time immemorial: poverty, abuse, fractured relationships
and social neglect.</TE>
<TE>   I do believe a good part of this nation was born in the streets;
its future is being born there every day. If we're going to make
heroes of earlier people who did all they could to survive, don't
make demons of those trying to do the same thing today.</TE>

<HD>Putting the Brakes on Blowhard 'Bloggers'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Norah Vincent</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a columnist in Yardley, Pa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Internet is a frontier, then the online self-publishing
phenomenon called Web logging, or "blogging," is the virtual Wild
West where any old varmint with a Web site can shoot his mouth off. A
recent decision by the High Court of Australia, however, could
civilize the Internet, perhaps to the detriment of the 1st Amendment.</LD>
<LD>   The Australian case involves an allegedly defamatory article that
Barron's newspaper published about Melbourne mining magnate Joseph
Gutnick.</LD>
<LD>   Though the article was published in the U.S., it was downloaded
from the Web in Australia. So the court ruled that Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
the parent company of Barron's, could be sued for damages under
Australian, not American, libel law.</LD>
<TE>   This is bad news for free speech in cyberspace because it means
that Web content, wherever it originates, might be subject to foreign
libel laws, many of which are much stricter than our own.</TE>
<TE>   Australian Precedent</TE>
<TE>   This wouldn't matter so much if it meant simply that major media
outlets would have to spend more time fending off complaints. After
all, they can afford to, although all such costs eventually trickle
down to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   But what about pipsqueak bloggers who can't afford to protect
themselves from the umbrageous hordes at home, let alone abroad? The
Australian precedent could burden them immeasurably and thus raises
the question: Is policing speech in the blogosphere a good and
necessary thing or just another way to mum the common man?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it's both, which is why there is cause to be heartened
and concerned.</TE>
<TE>   We should be concerned because, until recently, the blogosphere
has been a haven of free expression.</TE>
<TE>   Though libel law has always applied to Web content, most bloggers
have flown beneath the radar, making it possible to disseminate their
sometimes injudicious remarks with virtual impunity. And most of the
time that has been a good thing because, unlike in the gated confines
of print newspapers and magazines whose hand-picked and bowdlerized
letters sections abrogate reader feedback, anybody can participate in
public debate on the Net. One-man bands such as Instapundit,
Kausfiles, andrewsullivan.com and a hundred smaller operations are
spicing the debate, keeping the media powers honest and putting our
free press through its paces.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a flip side to this. As much as the blogosphere is
full of brave and vital input, it's also full of the careless, mad
and sometimes vengeful ravings of half-wits who will say anything,
especially about established journalists and writers, just to attract
more attention to their sites. This can get ugly when content is
unregulated.</TE>
<TE>   Internet Outrages</TE>
<TE>   In the major media world, editors and fact-checkers try to catch
inaccuracies, excise lies and slanders and print corrections and
retractions for mistakes that slip into print. But few bloggers
follow this protocol. What they say, however outrageous or unfounded,
tends to stick.</TE>
<TE>   Full disclosure: This happened to me when I integrated four words
from a Jackson Browne song into a piece I posted on my blog. Another
blogger accused me of plagiarism, and the unmerited charge spread
across the Web at frightening speed.</TE>
<TE>   As any conspiracy theorist knows, falsehoods take on an authority
all their own on the Internet. So when bloggers willfully defame
those with professional reputations to defend, that is a serious
breach for which they should be held accountable.</TE>
<TE>   Blogging is one of the best things that has ever happened to
freedom of expression and the press, and we should make every effort
to protect its scrupulous practitioners. But freedoms come with
responsibilities. Common journalistic standards of accuracy and fair
play exist for good reasons, and bloggers, like the rest of us, must
abide by them. By drawing attention to libelous Web content, the
Australian case may force them to.</TE>

<HD>Curbing Police Chases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police chases on television dramas never end with a pedestrian dead
or an infant in a family minivan maimed. In the real world, however,
police chases left 541 people dead in the last decade across
California, according to federal statistics. That includes 191
innocent passersby.</LD>
<LD>   It may be impossible to eliminate all such deaths and injuries.
But a proposal by Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton to
strictly limit when officers can give chase, coupled with a stinging
legal opinion concerning a state law that cloaks police officers with
broad liability protection, provides the impetus to reduce the risk.</LD>
<LD>   High-speed pursuits force patrol officers to balance protecting
the public from dangerous people against the confusing moment when a
pursuit becomes too risky to continue. But Los Angeles Police
Department guidelines have added to the volatile mix by encouraging
officers to give chase.</LD>
<TE>   The LAPD saw the number of pursuits rise to 781 in 2001, up from
597 a year earlier. The number of pedestrians injured was double the
1998 total. Equally troubling is that at least 60% of LAPD chases
were prompted by such minor offenses as broken taillights and missing
license plates.</TE>
<TE>   A city Police Commission study of big-city pursuit policies
identified Dallas, Las Vegas and Los Angeles as departments with the
highest percentage of pursuits that ended in collisions. The common
denominator: All three cities allow officers to chase traffic
violators. In contrast, the smaller Orange County Sheriff's
Department prohibits pursuits for traffic infractions alone. It
conducted just eight pursuits in 2001 and reported one collision.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has asked the commission to prohibit pursuits just for
traffic infractions. The chief wants to shift critical
decision-making from adrenalin-pumped officers in patrol cars to
supervisors with their feet more firmly on the ground. Helicopters
would also take a bigger role in chases. This is a good balance, and
the commission should resist the temptation to make the rules even
sterner, which could hobble police.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators in Sacramento should review a 15-year-old law that
provides what a state appeals court has described as a
"get-out-of-liability card" for officers involved in chases. Justices
in the 4th District Court of Appeals prodded legislators to
"seriously reconsider the balance between public entity immunity and
public safety. The balance appears to have shifted too far toward
immunity."</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to punish police for performing a dangerous and
necessary job. But law enforcement agencies should establish and
enforce strict pursuit policies. And officers must believe that truly
reckless pursuits will carry strong penalties.</TE>

<HD>Missile Plan Doesn't Fly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not since Ronald Reagan's years in the White House has an
administration been so enthusiastic about missile defense. The
Clinton and first Bush administrations harbored legitimate doubts
about the effectiveness of a shield against incoming intercontinental
missiles. But they kept providing billions of dollars for testing, as
has the current Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the administration decided not just to keep testing,
but to deploy. Under its plan, interceptor stations would be
established at an Alaskan facility and at Vandenberg Air Force Base
in 2004 to shoot missiles at incoming missiles -- firing a "bullet at
a bullet." Three of the last eight tests have been outright failures,
and countermeasures like decoy missiles would no doubt make it even
less accurate in the real world.</LD>
<LD>   Deployment would be expensive. The cost of continued testing is $8
billion a year, already approved by Congress. To build the new
facilities would require at least an additional $1.5 billion over two
years. For that money, Americans would get a system that Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday is "better than nothing."</LD>
<TE>   Along with land-based antimissile systems, the Pentagon said it
would put smaller interceptors on several Navy ships and would
upgrade the Patriot missile system to counter shorter-range attack
missiles. They are just the start of a multilayered system that,
ideally, would someday be able to destroy missiles shortly after
launch, in mid-flight or after reentry to the Earth's atmosphere.
That's an ambitious, costly and speculative plan. For now, the money
would be better spent on more immediate threats.</TE>
<TE>   Last January, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the nation
was more likely to be attacked in the next 10 years by terrorists
with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons than by a hostile nation
firing intercontinental missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, granted, North Korea has acknowledged a continuing
nuclear weapons development program. It also may end its voluntary
moratorium on flight-testing new missiles. But the defense that
worked for the United States during the Cold War still stands: the
knowledge that any country attacking the U.S. faces devastating
retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Start with security at the nation's ports, including those at Long
Beach and Los Angeles. After 9/11, the two sought $70 million in
federal grants for security, but only got about $6 million. Money
spent at the ports would not chase phantoms, but protect against real
threats.</TE>

<HD>A Metastasizing Shortfall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A billion dollars at a time, the state budget shortfall is spiraling
out of control as the California Legislature fiddles. The staggering
$34.8-billion, 18-month budget shortfall that Gov. Gray Davis
described at a press conference Wednesday would effectively reduce
the current fiscal year's general fund spending to a level not seen
since the post-recession years of the mid-1990s. Then, California was
home to about 3 million fewer residents.</LD>
<LD>   Davis delivered the shock in his typical monotone, along with a
measured warning that "there's no time for hand wringing.... We must
face this problem head-on."</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers who were supposed to begin a special budget session
Monday are now squabbling about whose figures to believe in a
nickel-and-dime fight over whether Davis is exaggerating. They have
failed to act on $10.2 billion in immediate cuts proposed by Davis.
Every day that the state spends money at last year's level increases
the future pain for students in classrooms, drivers in line at DMV
offices and the working poor waiting for public health care.</LD>
<TE>   California isn't alone. From the redwood forests to the Gulf
Stream waters, statehouses are facing the morning-after realization
that budgets made fat during the nation's longest bull market are
alarmingly out of balance with available revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Davis promises to deliver a full budget proposal -- complete with
proposed cuts and new taxes and fees -- Jan. 10. But legislators
should be acting now. Today. Start by considering Davis' painful
proposed cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there is waste to be cut. But that only nips a corner of the
shortfall. Those angrily shouting "no new taxes" need only look at
the facts. California's overall tax burden ($11.35 per $100 of
personal income) is just slightly higher than the national average
($11.04), and the state's reliance on fees and other non-tax revenue
is near the average for other states. Half of the state's new jobs in
recent years were in the service sector. The state should leverage
that growth by extending the sales tax to auto repair bills, sporting
event tickets, fees paid to lawyers and other untaxed services and
goods.</TE>
<TE>   Past governors and legislatures dealt with cyclical budget crises
with appropriate budget cuts and temporary revenue increases. The
days of easing a budget crisis by freezing huge transportation or
water projects, though, are over. Health, education and social
welfare account for 71% of state spending, so there are no big, easy
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican divas who are swooning over the prospect of even
short-term tax increases should read the budgetary score. They
haven't proposed a plan to right the budget with cuts alone, and they
know they can't. Schoolchildren, the very poor, the elderly and the
infirm would bear the greatest burden. California could shuffle
toward resembling a Third World society.</TE>
<TE>   This state, the world's fifth-largest economy, can muscle through
its increasingly grave budget crisis. But lawmakers, their collective
level of experience sapped by term limits, have to sit down together
and act like adults. California's 35 million people can take bad news
delivered straight up. What they can't take is more fiddling.</TE>

<HD>Police Pursuits: Severely Punish Drivers Who Flee</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "L.A. Chief Proposes Ban on Majority of Police Pursuits," Dec. 17:
One of the primary ways to cut down on gang violence is to strictly
enforce traffic laws in areas with an inordinate amount of violent
crime. Most of the time, the violator is the average citizen who was
just not paying enough attention to the law.</LD>
<LD>   However, sometimes the violator is a gangbanger with a gun and is
about to do a drive-by shooting. Officers don't see many shootings
occur in front of them. The only way to get these guns off the street
is to use the law to make a stop and take the investigation from
there. If gang members know the police can't chase them, they're
going to flee every time they get hit by the lights. They (and their
guns) will go right back home. All that will have been accomplished
is a killing will be delayed.</LD>

<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only group of people who will benefit from a general ban on
pursuits are criminals. Since I am not a mind reader, nor do I know
any officers who are, I cannot tell if a person with the burned-out
brake light is simply a traffic violator. I do know that if they fail
to pull over, they have become more than a simple traffic violator.</TE>
<TE>   I will stress again and again: The police are not responsible for
the actions of those who violate the law, even if it involves
pursuing a traffic violator. Change the law to acknowledge the fact
that a fleeing suspect is now in command of a deadly weapon and
severely punish the driver who flees. If this ban does become
reality, I can assure you of one thing: Every person with bad
intentions need only disconnect a brake light, commit a crime and
fail to stop for an officer. By policy, the officer will be told to
discontinue the pursuit and the suspects will laugh along their
getaway route.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A state appellate court is urging lawmakers to change laws that
protect police officers from liability during pursuits (Dec. 15).
That's a great idea! But why stop there? Lawmakers should also allow
bars, restaurants and liquor stores to be sued for providing alcohol
to potential drunk drivers. And allow car manufacturers to be sued
for making cars that can go faster than the top speed limit.</TE>
<TE>   Where else but in America can you be awarded millions of dollars
for ruining your own lungs, spilling coffee in your lap or
(potentially) eating fast food? Individual accountability no longer
exists. It's always someone else's fault. So it doesn't make sense to
pass a law that truly punishes criminals who endanger the lives of
everyone by driving 100 miles per hour to get away from the police.
After all, the cops made them do it.</TE>

<HD>In the Senate, There's a Lott to Think About</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Scheer's Dec. 17 commentary, "Lott's Love Affair With Racism,"
may tell us why Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and others think the way
they do but it omits something larger and more important. The issue
isn't whether the senator's umpteenth apology is sincere, whether his
policy shift on a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday or affirmative
action is political cynicism or even if he is fit to lead the Senate.
Lott did not become Senate majority leader in a vacuum. He was chosen
by his fellow Republicans -- colleagues with whom he has shared
meals, opinions and ideologies daily, and for many years. Colleagues
who know him gave him this most important and powerful position.</LD>
<LD>   What Lott said in just a few words speaks volumes about the
Republican leadership in this country.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Aronow</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I applaud Sen. Don Nickles' (R-Okla.) courageous -- if potentially
self-serving -- challenge to Lott's continuing leadership of Senate
Republicans (Dec. 16). As a middle-of-the-road Democrat who
frequently crosses party lines, Lott's praise for a failed
segregationist presidential campaign reinforced the queasiness I
frequently experience when attempting to evaluate the "behind closed
doors" attitudes of many Republican leaders on important social
issues. Lott's apparent nostalgia for a discredited racist past at
least calls into question his fitness to continue serving as a
national leader. Notwithstanding his apologies, Lott's colleagues
should give careful consideration to the statement they will be
making to the nation if they choose to retain him to serve as Senate
majority leader.</TE>
<TE>   Lorin Fife</TE>
<TE>   Valley Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why is it that so many Republican senators lined up to lynch Bill
Clinton for lying about marital infidelity but when Lott, their own
leader, announces that America would be better off if blacks still
sat in the back of the bus, they don't utter a word? They impeached
Clinton for his "moral depravity" but they seem to have no problem
with the fact that Lott is a good-old-boy racist. I smell a double
standard.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Foyster</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lott claimed in his Dec. 16 Black Entertainment Television
interview that he wasn't referring to segregation when he said the
country "wouldn't have had all these problems" if Sen. Strom Thurmond
(R-S.C.) had become president. He then later said he "made a mistake"
with those remarks. If he wasn't talking about segregation, then what
exactly was his mistake? Accidentally offending an entire race of
people or getting caught doing it?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So Sean Penn thinks that because he has acted in and directed movies
he is therefore qualified to lecture President Bush on American
foreign policy (Dec. 16). He obviously has the same right to express
his views as anyone else, but because he is a celebrity he has media
access the rest of us do not have. His views are no more valuable or
well informed than those of the average Joe working hard just to keep
food on the table.</LD>
<LD>   We all have opinions; however, Penn and his ilk have the money,
name recognition and media access to shoot their mouths off to the
rest of us. So, to all the Hollywood noodle heads who think they have
something special to impart to the rest of us: Stick with what you do
well. Otherwise, shut up and sit down.</LD>

<LD>Your Dec. 14 editorial, "Life Flows Into L.A. River," depicting
incremental improvements was encouraging, but why not enhance the
long-term environmental, spiritual and economic worth of our city on
a grander scale? I suggest that we dam the river just south of
Exposition Park, creating Lago de Los Angeles. Derelict properties,
including slums and old railroad yards, could be acquired and
excavated to provide for expansion of the waters. Initial costs would
be repaid many times over.</LD>
<LD>   The lake would stimulate the conversion of scarcely inhabitable
areas into a mecca of residential, recreational and tourist
development -- and the ranking of Los Angeles among the great
water-based cities of the world. The lake would facilitate the
removal of the concrete channeling along the river's course and would
reduce the worry about a 100-year flood downstream.</LD>

<HD>Let the Popular Vote Decide the Presidency</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I can't believe that Al Gore has decided not to take on George W.
Bush again in 2004 (Dec. 16). If history repeats itself, he
definitely has a chance. In 1888, Democrat Grover Cleveland won the
popular vote but lost the electoral vote to Republican Benjamin
Harrison. Four years later, Cleveland reclaimed the White House after
winning the election over Harrison and Populist Party candidate James
B. Weaver. If it could happen then, it should have a chance of
happening in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   If history has no chance of repeating itself, much of the blame
lies with members of the media who have labeled Gore a loser, despite
the fact that he won the popular vote in 2000. The biggest blame,
however, should go to the electoral college, which should be trashed
completely. This fiasco could have been avoided if our presidents
were chosen by the popular vote alone. It's time to let the people,
rather than the Supreme Court, decide who our next president will be.</LD>

<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>

<TE>   Democratic pollster Mark Mellman is obviously relieved when he
claims that, with Gore in a 2004 campaign, "inevitably there'd be a
sense among the public the race was just a rehash of a decision
people thought they'd already made." Mellman should remind himself
that those "people" did indeed make a decision at the last election.
They voted for Gore.</TE>

<TE>   I'm puzzled by Mark Z. Barabak's statement (news analysis, Dec.
16) that only hard-core partisans (presumably Democrats) question the
legitimacy of President Bush's election. In truth, anyone with an
ounce of intellectual integrity -- whether Republican, Democrat or,
like myself, independent -- realizes that five rogue Supreme Court
justices awarded the presidency to Bush when it became obvious that
the voters had not done so. Assertions such as Barabak's stand as
part of the ongoing effort by the media to confer a mantle of
legitimacy on Bush, which voters have never done.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>According to "Animal Activist Finds Himself in Rat's Nest of Legal
Trouble" (Dec. 15), the black rats, Rattus rattus, that Rob
Puddicombe tried to rescue on Anacapa Island are known primarily as
urban nuisances. They were also a vector for plague-carrying fleas
during the Black Death of the 14th century that killed a third of the
population of Europe. The rat has ridden a parallel track with human
success, living in our cities, towns and farms because we provide

<LD>   The black rat is not in danger of extinction, and the eradication
of the population on Anacapa will not endanger the species. Removing
the rat from an ecology where it can only do damage is the
responsible thing to do. Every rat that eats a Xantus's murrelet egg
is the ethical equivalent of a human smashing the egg. If humans had
been able to take responsibility for the black rat population in the
14th century, history would have been spared one of its worst horrors
and the rat would not have the evil reputation it has today.</LD>

<HD>Charles Isaacs, 88; Radio, TV Writer Crafted Lines for
Famed Comedians</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Isaacs, a comedy writer whose career spanned work with Bing
Crosby and Milton Berle on radio and Red Skelton and Bob Hope on
television, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Isaacs died of cancer Friday at St. John's Health Center in Santa
Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Among his numerous television credits are stints as head writer of
the Skelton and Dinah Shore shows and "The Real McCoys," as well as
creating, writing and producing the sitcoms "Hey Jeannie" and "The
Tycoon." Early on, he created visual gags for Merrie Melodies and
Looney Tunes cartoons.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd say Charlie was an iron man, a real workhorse," said Jordan
Young, who interviewed Isaacs for his 1999 book, "The Laugh
Crafters."</TE>
<TE>   "He epitomized the comedy writer for the golden age of radio and
television, the anonymous galley slave toiling day and night to put
words in the mouths of famous comedians," said Young.</TE>
<TE>   Comedy writer Hal Kanter, who knew Isaacs for more than 50 years,
said Isaacs "was one of the most enchanting comedy writers that we've
ever had."</TE>
<TE>   "He was also a very fiercely independent gentleman," added Kanter.
"He was an ardent letter writer to the editors of The Times and other
publications. I think those of us who miss his comedy are also going
to miss his editorial comments."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Winnipeg, Canada, Isaacs grew up in Minneapolis, where his
father opened a branch of the family's grain supply business.</TE>
<TE>   Displaying a flair for humor, Isaacs wrote one-liners and humorous
vignettes for local newspaper columnists, which were often picked up
and repeated by radio personalities.</TE>
<TE>   After the Depression interrupted his study of journalism at the
University of Minnesota, Isaacs wrote scenarios for humorous
commercials shown in local movie houses and served as the Minneapolis
correspondent for Radio Guide magazine before taking off for
Hollywood in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   An unsolicited comedy sketch he wrote for Jack Benny landed him a
stint as a writer on the "The Jack Haley Show."</TE>
<TE>   Isaacs went on to write monologues for a show called "Al Pearce
and His Gang" and sketches for Charlie Ruggles, Adolphe Menjou, John
Barrymore and other stars on "The Texaco Star Theater."</TE>
<TE>   Then came "The Chase and Sanborn Hour," starring ventriloquist
Edgar Bergen and his wooden partner Charlie McCarthy. Isaacs wrote
material for Bergen as well as routines and sketches for the show's
guest stars such as W.C. Fields, who used one of Isaac's radio lines
in his 1939 comedy "You Can't Cheat an Honest Man," with Bergen and
McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the movie, Fields says, "As I look back on my
life, I get a lump in my throat."</TE>
<TE>   To which Charlie McCarthy says, "It's probably a cork."</TE>
<TE>   "The Kraft Music Hall," starring Crosby, "The Rudy Vallee Show"
and "The Milton Berle Show" followed -- as did Isaacs' marriage to
actress Doris Singleton, who later played Lucille Ball's friend
Carolyn Appleby on "I Love Lucy."</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Isaacs enlisted in the Coast Guard. In
addition to writing for the Coast Guard Band shows, he wrote
recruiting pitches, interviews and public relations speeches before
asking for sea duty. Trained as a gunner, he was stationed on a Navy
ship manned by Coast Guard personnel in the southwest Pacific. He
finished out the war in Hollywood writing for "Command Performance"
and other Armed Forces Radio shows.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Isaacs continued to amass a string of credits,
including writing for Fanny Brice's "The Baby Snooks Show" and "Amos
and Andy," as well as writing for Al Jolson and Oscar Levant on "The
Kraft Music Hall."</TE>
<TE>   Isaacs was fresh off Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' radio show when
he went into television in 1950 as head writer for Jimmy Durante on
the "All Star Revue," a comedy-variety show. He was later head writer
for Durante on "The Colgate Comedy Hour."</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the contributions, Isaacs, like many comedy writers,
did not receive public recognition for writing the funny lines for
the shows' stars, particularly when the stars were interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Isaacs told Young about complaining to Durante about the lack of
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was terribly unfair," Isaacs said. "Everybody,
besides the money, wants a little pat on the back."</TE>
<TE>   Isaacs said he and co-writer Jackie Elinson were in Durante's room
at the Astor Hotel in New York when Durante remembered that Isaacs
had yelled that "nobody seems to know Jackie and I write the show."</TE>
<TE>   As Isaacs and Elinson sat talking with Durante, a hotel maid came
in with a vacuum cleaner and Durante said, "Hilda, this is Charlie
and that's Jackie. These are the boys that write my material."</TE>
<TE>   As the maid finished vacuuming and headed out the door, Durante
said to his two writers, "See, I give you credit."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife of 61 years, Isaacs is survived by a
brother, Ken, of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The date for a memorial service at the Writers Guild is pending.</TE>

<HD>G. Kreisberg, 62; Covered Celebrity Court Cases for Decades</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Luther</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Kreisberg, who for almost 30 years covered celebrity court
stories in the main civil courthouse at 1st and Hill streets in
downtown Los Angeles, has died. Kreisberg, 62, who had diabetes and
heart problems, was found dead in his home Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody knew George, he had an enormous range of contacts,"
said Linda Deutsch, an Associated Press special correspondent who met
Kreisberg in the 1970s covering celebrity cases. "In a way, George
was born too late. He should have been part of the rough and tumble
newspaper worlds of the 1930s and '40s.... He loved covering the
story. He was very good at getting information, and he just knew
everybody."</LD>
<LD>   "George is what we used to call in the old days a hell of a leg
man," said Sandi Gibbons, now a spokeswoman for the district
attorney's office, who hired Kreisberg as an overnight writer for
City News Service in the mid-1970s.</LD>
<TE>   Another friend and fellow courts writer, Sherry Overend, said, "He
did not get the glory, he did not get the bylines, but he got the
stories."</TE>
<TE>   Kreisberg covered many of the cases that attorney Marvin
Mitchelson handled, including those of Richard Harris, Tony Curtis,
Joan Collins, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Mel Torme.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd go after a story and stay with it and follow up on it,"
Mitchelson said Wednesday of Kreisberg, whom he called a kind man.</TE>
<TE>   Kreisberg, who attended Emerson College in Boston and did graduate
studies at Hofstra University on Long Island, N.Y., worked at NBC-TV
before being hired at City News Service in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he provided information on celebrity court cases
to Entertainment Weekly and the Star and Globe tabloids as well as
AP.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by two daughters, Jodi Sears of Albuquerque and
Randi Freedman of Tulsa, Okla. A memorial is planned for Saturday at
noon at Taix restaurant, 1911 Sunset Blvd.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>American Conservatory Theater actress Ruth Kobart, who participated
in the theater's first San Francisco production, died Saturday. She
was 78. Kobart, who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, died
at her home in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The actress appeared as Madame Pernelle in "Tartuffe," the
company's first production at the Geary Theater in 1967.</LD>
<LD>   "What a night it was! The house was electric, and the whole thing
was a big love affair between us and the audience," she recalled 25
years later. "The more they loved it, the better we got. We really
took off with a whoosh!"</LD>
<TE>   She continued to perform with the troupe off and on until 1994.
She last appeared in "Home," directed by current ACT artistic
director Carey Perloff.</TE>
<TE>   Born April 24, 1924, in Des Moines, Kobart began her professional
life in New York, where she pursued a career in opera. She made her
professional debut off Broadway as the witch in "Hansel and Gretel"
with the Lemonade Opera, and then frequently performed in New York
and on tour with the NBC Opera.</TE>
<TE>   Kobart also performed in theater, film and TV. She was nominated
for a Tony Award in 1963 for "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to
the Forum." Her TV and movie career included "Bob," "Trapper John,
M.D.," "Dirty Harry" and "Sister Act."</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by a brother, Howard Skahn of Minneapolis.</TE>

<HD>Kathy Magiera, 54; Led Seattle Opera Out of Financial
Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kathy Magiera, 54, who took over the administrative reins of the
Seattle Opera at a time of financial crisis, stabilized its budget
and oversaw its move into a new opera house, died Saturday in Seattle
after a long battle with cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Magiera did not plan on a career in opera management. A native of
Omaha who graduated from Indiana's Butler University as a dance
major, she followed a man she was dating to San Diego in the early
1970s and soon found herself working for the San Diego Opera.</LD>
<LD>   She began as a secretary, and by the end of six years was director
of administration. By 1983 she was ready to move on, and was hired as
administrative director of the Seattle Opera.</LD>
<TE>   She won praise for leading the opera to financial solvency with a
plan that required the company to go without expensive new
productions for three consecutive seasons, relying instead on new
takes on borrowed or remounted productions.</TE>
<TE>   She also helped the company win a National Arts Stabilization
grant, which meant eliminating its deficit and establishing a
long-range plan.</TE>
<TE>   In October she was named an "Unsung Hero" by the Seattle Corporate
Council for the Arts for her leadership of the opera.</TE>
<TE>   A stage at Seattle's new opera house will be named the Kathy A.
Magiera Stage as the result of a $1-million gift in her honor from
philanthropist Marion Oliver McCaw Garrison.</TE>

<HD>Rodrick Best, 32; Environmentalist, Pivotal Figure in
Recycling Efforts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rodrick "Rick" Best, the environmentalist who in a short, intense
career battled Coca-Cola Co., Miller Brewing Co. and Dow AgroSciences
on behalf of the California recycling movement, died Dec. 11 at
Sutter General Hospital in Sacramento of complications after a car
accident. He was 32.</LD>
<LD>   His death has friends and family agreeing that he was an important
advocate, but each singling out different accomplishments.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a whole lot of people in this town who think Rick is
their guy," said Mark Murray, executive director of the 25-year-old
Sacramento lobbying group Californians Against Waste.</LD>
<TE>   To Murray, Best was a bright engineering student from Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo who, beginning in 1991, helped create from scratch the
kind of waste disposal industry that has made California the national
leader in recycling.</TE>
<TE>   To former Assemblyman Fred Keely (D-Boulder Creek), Best was a
staff member who helped shepherd a dozen environmental bills through
the state Assembly, including AB 2214, which prevented creation of a
radioactive-waste dump in the Mojave Desert's Ward Valley.</TE>
<TE>   To the staff of Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, Best was
the man who forced Miller Brewing to listen to the city Bureau of
Sanitation before launching a new line of beer bottles.</TE>
<TE>   To his family, he was the pioneer who opened up three Ventura
County public schools to disabled children.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of five sons of an aerospace engineer father and
social worker mother in Thousand Oaks, Best was a paraplegic whose
spinal cord had been severed at birth.</TE>
<TE>   But his disability did not make him acquiescent.</TE>
<TE>   After a short stint in what was then known as an orthopedic
school, Best wanted to be in the same schools as everyone else, said
his father, Louis. The family waged the first of many battles for
wheelchair access that made Best not just the first paraplegic in his
elementary school, but also in his middle and high schools.</TE>
<TE>   He was studying engineering at Cal Poly in 1990 when California
enacted the nation's most aggressive recycling law, requiring half
the state's waste stream to be diverted from dumps into recycling
programs in the next 10 years. The penalty for local governments that
missed the target would be fines of up to $10,000 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Best wanted to be part of the changeover. When Murray of
Californians Against Waste appeared at his campus in a 1991 forum,
"Rick rolled right up to me and said, 'I want to work for you guys,'
" Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 years, Best went from intern to the organization's policy
director. Meeting the new recycling quotas required full-scale social
change. Steven Jones, now a member of the California Integrated Waste
Management Board, was a San Francisco garbage hauler at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "The popular assumption was that you could put recyclable
materials out at the curb and have a truck come pick them up and that
they will automatically come back to the marketplace as another
product," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That was not, Jones stressed, the case. There was no market for
discarded plastic soda bottles. Best, he said, not only saw the
problem, but a solution: hold the food industry accountable for the
packaging it pumped into the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Best went after Coca-Cola. Allen Hershkowitz, senior scientist
with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based lobbying
group, thought it one of Best's finest efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Coca-Cola made an initial commitment to use recycled plastic in
1989. When it reneged, Rick mobilized the environmental community
nationally to begin a campaign against Coke," Hershkowitz said. The
soft-drink giant pledged to incorporate 10% recycled content in its
plastic bottles.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1999, Best and Galanter took on Miller Brewing , which
was the first major brewer to test-market plastic beer bottles in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized this was the test case," said Galanter's chief of
staff, Niki Tennant. "If we could get Miller to use recycled content,
and make the bottles recyclable, it was going to make a huge impact
on the waste stream. We brought in a resolution right before the
Super Bowl and got national media attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We got Miller to sit down and make the bottle recyclable and put
recycled content in it," said Tennant. "Rick was a brilliant
strategist."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Best became president of the GrassRoots Recycling
Network, an organization designed to help activists around the
country mount similar campaigns. Two years ago, he joined the staff
of Central California Assemblyman Keely and began shepherding what
Keely estimates were a dozen significant bills through the Assembly
to the governor's desk.</TE>
<TE>   After the car accident in August, Best was in and out of
consciousness as Gov. Gray Davis signed two Best bills. The first
prohibits development of the Ward Valley landfill site and any
unlined trench disposal system of radioactive waste anywhere in the
state. The second bill demanded the removal of a Dow weed killer from
lawn care products after it had been shown to contaminate compost
made from recycled yard waste.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick affected what happened in waste management in California,"
said Hershkowitz. "This is a subject where the nation looks to
California for the lead. Rick made a very big difference in a very
short time."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his father, Best is survived by his mother,
Barbara, and brothers Phillip, David, Timothy and Christopher.</TE>

<HD>E.J. Cossman, 84; Ant Farm, Spud Gun Made Him Fortune</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>E. Joseph Cossman, who made millions marketing such must-have items
as shrunken heads, spud guns and the now-ubiquitous ant farm, and
then made millions telling entrepreneurs how to do the same thing,
has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Cossman, a door-to-door salesman who perfected mail-order
salesmanship and pioneered the television infomercial, then wrote
books and conducted pricey seminars to demonstrate the route from
rags to riches, died Dec. 7 in Palm Springs. His daughter, Ronna Binn
of Tarzana, said he died of complications from a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing seemed to escape Cossman's notice. He once was at a trade
show selling reproductions of famous artworks for 50 cents each,
pitying his next-booth neighbor, who was touting shrunken heads at a
whopping $2.98. But in three days' time, Cossman also noted that he
had sold about two dozen Da Vincis and Van Goghs while the other
fellow had sold 3,000 shrunken heads.</LD>
<TE>   So, as he later would advise those attending his seminars, he
acted. Fast. He formed a partnership with the seller of shrunken
heads, abandoned cheap art and in a year sold 2 million of the little
skulls.</TE>
<TE>   Cossman was offered tooling for making the "spud gun," a toy
pistol that fires pieces of potato, for $500 by a toy maker who had
made 100,000 but sold only 10,000. Dubious, Cossman checked with the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and learned to his delighted surprise
that the country was in the middle of its biggest potato glut in two
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Cossman bought the spud gun-making machinery and solicited
potatoes from growers, promising the toy would solve their economic
problems. He had more than five tons of spuds delivered to him in New
York City, dumped them on a sidewalk and got arrested. Predictably,
the publicity got him on the morning network television talk shows,
where he gleefully discussed his potato-firing pistol.</TE>
<TE>   He sold 2 million of those, too -- in six months.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had 20 big winners in my lifetime -- ones I've sold 1
million or more of. I only created two," he told the San Diego
Business Journal in 1989. The two inventions were the ant farm and a
fishing lure that smelled like meat.</TE>
<TE>   For the things he didn't invent, he said, "I contacted the
manufacturers and got exclusive rights in writing. Then I'd market it
as if it were my own product."</TE>
<TE>   When Cossman turned his own marketing success into daylong $595
how-to seminars, he aptly titled segments: "How to Profit From Trade
Shows," "How to Get Free Publicity" and "How to Find a Product or
Service."</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, when he switched from selling oddities to selling advice,
Cossman put his experience into a book, "How I Made $1,000,000 in
Mail Order." In 1965 he wrote "Get $50,000 Worth of Services Free
Each Year From the U.S. Government," and a decade later updated that
book to $100,000 in freebies.</TE>
<TE>   Cossman liked to offer speeches at public libraries, crediting
them as the source of his self-education about patent rights and
marketing. Later in life, he earned an MBA from Pepperdine, which
decided his career experience amounted to a self-tutored bachelor's
degree.</TE>
<TE>   Born poor in Pittsburgh, Cossman worked five years as a
door-to-door salesman during the Depression, then served in the Army
during World War II. He became an entrepreneur after the war by
shipping soap to soap-deprived Europe, and became a lifelong
practitioner of overseas marketing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, Cossman formed Los Angeles-based Cossman &amp; Levine Inc., a
mail-order novelty supplier, with his brother-in-law, Milton Levine.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, they introduced the ant farm, which Cossman and
his family said he invented. Levine also claimed credit for inventing
the case filled with 25 ever-busy ants, but the creative rivalry
never daunted their teamwork in marketing the durable educational
toy.</TE>
<TE>   They paid ant-rustlers a penny apiece to find Pogonomyrmex
Californicus, red harvester ants from the Mojave Desert. They refined
the product as they went along -- replacing, for example, the
original glue, which proved fatal to the ants.</TE>
<TE>   Both men touted the ant farm on television, with Cossman once
paying a helicopter pilot $300 to fly 300 live ants to his hotel room
after he landed an unexpected spot on Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show."</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, Levine bought out Cossman, renamed the company Uncle
Milton Industries and packaged the product as Uncle Milton's Ant
Farm. The ant farm is still sold from the company's Westlake Village
headquarters, at a 100,000-a-month pace during the Christmas season.
More than 2 million farms have been sold since its introduction
nearly half a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Cossman turned to other pursuits, becoming one of the first to pay
for half-hour blocks of television time to advertise the seminars he
would stage for a fee across the U.S. and Canada. He called his show
"Cossman's Secrets" and used the interview format as a sales tool.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his daughter, Cossman is survived by his wife of 62 years,
Pearl Levine Cossman; a son, Howard; and four grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>State Probes Alleged Abuse at Juvenile Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials said Wednesday that they are investigating
allegations that a group home for juvenile offenders in Northern
California delayed medical treatment of a 14-year-old, who lost sight
in one eye, and that it committed other alleged abuses.</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Social Services accused Rite of
Passage in San Andreas, about 90 miles east of Sacramento, of
canceling several medical appointments for the teenager, and using
the prospect of an eventual exam to change his behavior.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the teenager became blind in one eye, according to
the department.</LD>
<TE>   "The action we are taking can potentially move to revocation of
the facility's license and closure," said department spokeswoman
Blanca Castro.</TE>
<TE>   "We may, however, reach an agreement or settlement that would
ensure this severe and serious incident does not happen again," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Howell, executive director of Rite of Passage, said that
the boy missed only one medical appointment and that the problem "did
not result in the loss of the young man's vision."</TE>
<TE>   "A doctor who looked at his case said his vision was headed that
way anyway," Howell said. "Missing one medical appointment is
serious, but we don't believe it deserves shutting the facility
down."</TE>
<TE>   Castro said there are "three other serious, separate complaints we
are investigating there right now. All involve other teens."</TE>
<TE>   "We are using these cases to inform other probation departments
that place kids in this facility about the complaints," Castro added.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the juveniles at Rite of Passage come from Los Angeles
County.</TE>

<HD>Deep Decline in Air Traffic Still Being Felt</HD>
<DH>Dramatic decreases in domestic flights persist at many
airports more than a year after Sept. 11, report shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many U.S. airports that saw drastic cutbacks in domestic passenger
service after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have not recovered, with
some still showing double-digit declines, according to a national
report released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Among major airports facing the sharpest drop-off in scheduled
flights is Los Angeles International Airport, which now has 20% fewer
flights compared with last fall, the study said. Only Boston's Logan
International Airport experienced a steeper decline -- 23% -- in
domestic commercial service.</LD>
<LD>   As a group, large airports have lost 10.3% of their scheduled
domestic flights, according to the report. San Francisco
International Airport suffered an 18% drop.</LD>
<TE>   Medium and small hub airports on average experienced a 6.6%
decline, the study said. Palm Springs International Airport, which
saw a quarter of its scheduled flights disappear in a year's time,
ranked eighth on the list of smaller airports with the biggest
service cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis compared domestic schedules at more than 500
commercial airports for the week starting Oct. 1, 2001, to schedules
for the week of Sept. 30, 2002. Those weeks were chosen to avoid
holidays and other irregular travel periods that can cause schedule
fluctuations, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   Although Burbank Airport had a 3.13% drop in scheduled service,
according to the study's interactive Web site, airport officials say
the number of flights has now almost returned to pre-Sept. 11 levels.</TE>
<TE>   The largest carrier at Burbank is Southwest Airlines, which has
remained financially healthy while other large airlines have
suffered.</TE>
<TE>   Other Southland airports reflect the trends indicated by the
report. For the first 10 months of this year, traffic fell by 4% at
Ontario International Airport and by 2.7% at Santa Ana's John Wayne
Airport compared to 2001, according to airport officials.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere across the country, the study found many small and
regional airports were hit especially hard, losing a high percentage
of flights for trips under 500 miles.</TE>
<TE>   And at 21 small airports -- including Sonoma County in California
-- commercial airline service ceased altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers are confronting fewer choices, more crowded aircraft
and an overall reduction in accessibility," said Hank Dittmar,
co-director of the study by Reconnecting America, a project seeking
to change U.S. transportation policy and boost the use of rail.</TE>
<TE>   Dittmar is a former director of Santa Monica Airport and a former
executive director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project.</TE>
<TE>   The study, which was funded by the Great American Station,
MacArthur, Packard, Surdna and Turner foundations, calls for changes
in government policy to "shore up our crumbling intercity travel
network" and improve access for medium-sized and smaller cities
because airports play such an important role in local economies.</TE>
<TE>   It also proposes making airport terminals into "travelports" with
better connections to regional train and bus systems to boost
long-distance air travel as well as such transit options as
high-speed rail for shorter trips.</TE>
<TE>   Airline experts expressed skepticism at the feasibility of the
travelport idea, but acknowledged that the industry is facing its
toughest time in history.</TE>
<TE>   Already troubled before Sept. 11, the commercial air industry has
since gone into a virtual nosedive, evidenced by the recent
bankruptcy protection filings of US Airways and United Airlines.
Despite $5 billion in federal aid, the industry lost $7.7 billion
last year and will likely lose an additional $9 billion this year,
said David Swierenga, chief economist for the Air Transport Assn.</TE>
<TE>   While low-fare carriers such as Southwest have found success in
the regional market, other airlines have slashed short-haul flights
because they are costly to operate.</TE>
<TE>   The study notes that federal fees and taxes, higher now because of
increased security, can account for 19% of a $300 ticket but take a
44% bite out of a $100 ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling the most squeezed, according to the report, are some of
the nation's smallest airports.</TE>
<TE>   Sonoma County Airport, which served 24,000 departing passengers
last year with four daily flights to Los Angeles and two to San
Francisco, has not had any commercial service since United Express
left the market in October 2001. The airport, which has an operating
budget of $1.8 million, saw its revenues plunge by $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been hard on the airport," said airport manager Jon Stout.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he added, for residents who want to catch a flight, the
nearest airports are in San Francisco and Oakland, at least two hours
away by car.</TE>
<TE>   For Sonoma residents, "there's no convenient way to get to
Southern California right now," Stout said.</TE>

<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   Want bold from Gov. Gray Davis? You got it Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe some drama, too. Even fun.</LD>
<TE>   A bold move for desperate times.</TE>
<TE>   For a governor, it doesn't get much more desperate than being
perched on the precipice of a deficit hole that's 45% of your general
fund. That would be a $35-billion gaping canyon -- roughly 60% bigger
than last month's best estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Unprecedented. Not even Gov. Pete Wilson peered into such fiscal
straits.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you shut down all of state government, that wouldn't come
close to solving the problem. Remember, 70% of the general fund flows
to schools and local government.</TE>
<TE>   Sound the bugle and call for: Steve Peace. Truly brilliant. Truly
a wild man.</TE>
<TE>   Truly the opposite of Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a quickie sketch of Peace, 49, the governor's new finance
director-designate:</TE>
<TE>   * A Democratic legislator from San Diego for 20 years. Chairman of
the Senate Budget Committee before being booted by term limits this
year.</TE>
<TE>   * Produced the cult film "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes." It's
entertaining and a must mention in any profile.</TE>
<TE>   * He gets blamed more than any other legislator for the infamous
electricity deregulation back in 1996. It's largely a bum rap. He
headed the conference committee and negotiated a better bill for
consumers than what Wilson and his Public Utilities Commission had
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   * As an assemblyman, he was a rebel. Literally. He conspired with
four colleagues -- they called themselves "The Gang of Five" -- and
tried to muscle out Speaker Willie Brown. They almost succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   * He's a wound-up workaholic, incessant talker and frequent pain
in the backside who never stops thinking, analyzing, visualizing.</TE>
<TE>   * Loves public policy -- a lot more than politics. Most
politicians are exactly the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Like Davis, Peace can be labeled a moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Davis, he's not risk-averse.</TE>
<TE>   And he's a social animal.</TE>
<TE>   Uncharacteristically, Davis took a gamble here. Maybe he was out
of cards. He wanted to replace Finance Director Tim Gage, a loyal,
soft-spoken former legislative aide who had served him for four
years. The governor preferred another former lawmaker, but that pick
turned down the offer.</TE>
<TE>   Peace had unquestioned credentials and was eager for the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Here's why it's a gamble and potentially a brilliant move for
Davis to make Peace his No. 1 budget guy:</TE>
<TE>   * Peace, unlike most Davis aides, won't be afraid to speak up and
say what he thinks. The governor will get an earful of his budget
chief's best advice. The risk is he'll get it over and over -- long
after they should have moved on to another subject.</TE>
<TE>   * Davis has a lousy relationship with the Legislature. He has
developed few loyal allies there and has no real friendships. Peace
can help. He understands the legislative mind. And, unlike Gage,
he'll be treated as a peer rather than a staffer.</TE>
<TE>   * Besides knowing the budget A to Z, Peace is a visionary. If
Davis is, he hasn't shown it. Davis can learn a lot by listening. The
risk is Peace will push his own agenda more than Davis'.</TE>
<TE>   Peace has thought extensively about how California should
restructure its tax system to make it less volatile. Make it less
vulnerable to hard times -- and act less like a Super Lotto jackpot
during boom periods.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be done," Peace told me recently. "Otherwise, we
don't need the earthquake. We're going to fall into the ocean by
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   He says, "Republicans have got to stop praying to Prop. 13.
Democrats have to stop resisting capital gains breaks."</TE>
<TE>   The problem of unpredictable tax revenues -- from the Capitol to
courthouses -- "is all traceable to Prop. 13," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13 in 1978 drastically cut property taxes and forced
California governments to rely more on sales and state income taxes.
The sales tax led to more sprawl -- urban shopping malls replaced
residential housing -- and the income tax resembles a roller coaster.</TE>
<TE>   Peace believes businesses should pay higher property taxes because
their land turns over and gets reassessed much less often than
residential dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   But right now, he says, the Legislature should get busy chopping
programs. "Health care is going to get hammered."</TE>
<TE>   Peace isn't afraid to say cut back on grandma's medical care and
raise taxes. Even attack sacred cow Prop. 13.</TE>
<TE>   It'll be fascinating to see how long these two opposites last
together. If they do last, it's likely to change government. For the
better.</TE>

<HD>Coastal Panel Challenge Aired</HD>
<DH>State appellate justices ask some hard questions of a
lawyer arguing that the commission's very makeup is a violation of
the state Constitution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A state appellate court panel on Wednesday vigorously challenged
assertions that the composition of the California Coastal Commission
is unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   The justices were responding to oral arguments in a case, brought
by the co-founder of a conservative legal foundation and upheld by a
lower court last year, that could strip the coastal commissioners of
most of their powers to dictate what can and cannot be built along
the coast.</LD>
<LD>   The justices focused on the principal argument raised by property
rights lawyer Ronald Zumbrun that the commission violates the state
Constitution's separation of powers doctrine because the Legislature
appoints two-thirds of the 12-member panel that acts like an
executive agency by granting or denying building permits.</LD>
<TE>   "There are a lot of presidents unhappy with their appointees to
the U.S. Supreme Court because they didn't act the way they hoped
they would," said Arthur G. Scotland, presiding justice of the 3rd
District Court of Appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Scotland was more open to the assertion that the lawmakers'
ability to remove these commissioners "at will" gives the Legislature
too much control over the executive branch.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's talk human nature here," Scotland said. "When you have a
position that you want to keep, it puts you in a subservient role.
Your basic desire is not to lose your job.... So why doesn't that
create a problem?</TE>
<TE>   Scotland raised an issue that has long swirled around the Coastal
Commission. Without fixed terms, commissioners can come under strong
pressure from the people who appointed them. The issue surfaced again
last week, when the staff of Gov. Gray Davis and Assembly Speaker
Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) were urging their appointees to replace
environmental activist Sara Wan as chairwoman.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate justices looked hard at what Stephen R. Barnett, an
expert on the state Constitution at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall law
school, said may be a legal flaw in the way the commission was
organized. He cited a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court case which drew a
similar objection to Congress threatening to remove officers in the
executive branch.</TE>
<TE>   The question for the appellate justices, he said, will be how to
fashion a remedy. Barnett said they could simply strike down that
portion of the Coastal Act that says commissioners can be "removed at
will."</TE>
<TE>   If the justices do so, they will end up strengthening the
independence of the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Or, he said, they could "strike down the whole structure of the
commission, which is doubtless what the plaintiff would like."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Barbieri, a deputy attorney general arguing on behalf of
the Coastal Commission, maintained that the state Constitution
differs in many ways from the federal Constitution, especially in
granting the Legislature authority to appoint officers of the
executive branch. He noted that the governor's appointees do not make
up the majority of members on dozens of state commissions and
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the 1850s, it has always been the role of the Legislature
to appoint executive officers," Barbieri said. That authority, he
said, has been supported by court cases dating back to 1857.</TE>
<TE>   Zumbrun, the property rights lawyer, on Wednesday asked the
justices to "strip the California Coastal Commission of its
quasi-judicial and executive functions," which he says include
unchecked dictatorial powers over the state's 1,150-mile coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Zumbrun, co-founder of the Pacific Legal Foundation, has spent
more than a dozen years trying to find a judge who would agree with
his theory to unravel a commission.</TE>
<TE>   He brought up the argument in a lawsuit he filed on behalf of the
nonprofit Marine Forest Society, which built an artificial reef a
dozen years ago off Newport Beach without getting the proper permit
from the Coastal Commission. In addition to challenging the
commission's "cease and desist" order to remove the reef, Zumbrun
arguing that the commission's very existence violates the state
Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   He reiterated his main point to the appellate justices, focusing
on those members appointed by the Legislature. "The governor does not
have any power over them. The secretary of resources doesn't either.
They can thumb their nose at them and do anything they want," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles C. Kobayashi
ruled in Zumbrun's favor, declaring the commission to be a
"legislative body." As such, the judge decided, it cannot perform
functions of the executive branch, such as approving or denying
coastal development permits or issuing cease and desist orders.</TE>
<TE>   "Purportedly an executive agency, the commission is answerable to
no one in the executive [branch]," Kobayashi wrote. "The members are
not directly answerable to the voters. ... The Coastal Commission is
effectively a legislative agency."</TE>
<TE>   Kobayashi's decision, which was suspended on appeal, was unique in
that it was the first to challenge the commission for precisely what
has made it so effective in resisting outside pressures: the
independence it derives from splitting its appointments three ways.</TE>
<TE>   Because four members of the commission are appointed by the
governor, four by the Assembly speaker and four by the Senate Rules
Committee, no one person or entity has control over a majority of
members.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling is expected early next year from the appellate panel,
made up of Justices Scotland and Rodney Davis -- both appointees of
former Gov. George Deukmejian, who during the 1980s tried to
dismantle the Coastal Commission -- and Ronald B. Robie, recently
appointed to the court by Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>

<HD>Rural Health Care Gets Lift</HD>
<DH>U.S. agency salvages program offering visa waivers to
foreign doctors who promise to work in areas with a shortage of
physicians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rural health advocates in California on Wednesday cheered a move by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to sponsor visa
waivers for foreign physicians who practice in areas plagued by
doctor shortages.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, announced by Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy G. Thompson this week, salvages a program jeopardized this year
when the U.S. Department of Agriculture -- citing post-Sept. 11
jitters -- opted to no longer participate.</LD>
<LD>   Although states can also sponsor waivers each year -- the limit
just rose from 20 to 30 -- those don't meet the desperate need of
California's rural clinics, state officials and advocates say.</LD>
<TE>   "The big states run out right away, and then spend the rest of the
year apologizing to the little clinics," said L.A. immigration
attorney Carl Shusterman, whose specialties include physician
waivers. "HHS could really be the safety valve that allows big states
like California to survive."</TE>
<TE>   The USDA's abrupt departure from the program in February panicked
rural clinics that have come to rely on foreign doctors. The
department had sponsored more than 3,000 of the waivers since 1994,
232 of them for doctors in rural California. On Wednesday, advocates
expressed nothing short of glee.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so excited," said Cheri Voisine, spokeswoman for the
California State Rural Health Assn. "This opens up a lot of
opportunities for rural health providers."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Oliva is a public health consultant and member of the board
of the Oak Valley Hospital District, which includes the underserved
community of Waterford east of Modesto. She called the decision
"great news ... that means access to care will be stabilized in
underserved areas."</TE>
<TE>   She has recently met with strapped health providers in Del Norte
and Tehama counties but was unable to point them to a solution, since
the state already met its waiver quota for the year. "Now I can tell
them we may have access to international medical graduates again,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Long hours, antiquated hospital technology and a dearth of
cultural activities have kept U.S. medical graduates away from rural
practice. But as rural populations in California grow, the need has
only increased. Enter foreign medical residents.</TE>
<TE>   J-1 visas require them to return to their home countries for at
least two years after they complete their residencies, but that
condition can be waived if a greater public need is met.</TE>
<TE>   HHS has sponsored waivers, but only for elite biomedical
researchers. It will now take over the role played by the USDA in
handling waiver applications for primary care physicians who vow to
work in underserved areas.</TE>
<TE>   The move is a logical one for HHS, whose Health Resources and
Services Administration already tackles the problem of access to
health care through other programs. Among those is the National
Health Service Corps, which pays off loans for and provides
scholarships to U.S.-trained doctors who serve in areas with
physician shortages.</TE>
<TE>   HHS is also in a better position than the USDA to track doctors
after the waivers are issued and ensure they're working where they
are supposed to be. It plans to coordinate with state programs to
make sure the neediest areas are served.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to bring some better organization to the whole
process," said Stephen Smith of the Health Resources and Services
Administration, which has sought $2.5 million in the 2004 federal
budget for the work, he added. Physicians will first be directed to
state programs, but if the states where they are seeking work have
reached their annual limit, the requests will be processed. HHS plans
to issue 300 waivers a year, Smith said.</TE>

<HD>State Bar Investigating Lawyers Suing Auto Shops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The State Bar of California on Wednesday said it was investigating
the conduct and competence of two Beverly Hills lawyers who have sued
thousands of Southern California auto repair garages, restaurants and
markets.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to complaints from the state attorney general, the
Consumer Attorneys of California and the targeted merchants, bar
spokesman E.J. Bernacki confirmed that bar officials were
investigating Damian Trevor and Allan Hendrickson of the Trevor Law
Group.</LD>
<LD>   The state bar keeps the status of investigations confidential but
waived that restriction "in order to maintain the public's confidence
in the justice system," Bernacki said.</LD>
<TE>   The bar's chief trial counsel, Mike Nisperos, who approved the
waiver, would not discuss specifics of the investigation, saying only
that "the state bar has been monitoring this situation for some
time."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrickson declined to comment Wednesday. But Trevor said: "This
case is going to trial, and the real issues will be handled then."</TE>
<TE>   Since April, Trevor and his firm have sued 2,000 auto repair shops
in Los Angeles and Orange counties, accusing them of unfair business
practices. The suits say the shops have routinely lied to customers
about the condition of auto parts, billing and other matters,
accusations that the businesses deny.</TE>
<TE>   Garage owners say Trevor and Hendrickson are using the suits to
collect quick cash settlements from owners who want to avoid an
expensive trial.</TE>

<HD>'Knock-Out Drops' Found in Search, Deputy Testifies</HD>
<DH>Six suspicious bottles, as well as a video camera and
tapes, were discovered in home of date-rape suspect Andrew Luster, he
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County sheriff's detectives found a video camera and six
small plastic bottles, including one labeled "knock-out drops,"
during a search of date-rape suspect Andrew Luster's beach house two
years ago, a sex crimes detective testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators searched the 39-year-old surfer's Mussel Shoals home
after a 21-year-old college student reported that Luster drugged and
raped her there after they met at a downtown Santa Barbara bar.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Scott Peterson testified that detectives were looking for
the date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, when they found the
six small bottles in a locked bedroom closet. Peterson did not
testify to the contents, but he read the labels after removing the
vials from a brown paper evidence bag.</LD>
<TE>   "Spanish Liquid, Hypnotic Hypo," the detective read. "Lollypop
Juice, Knock-out Drops ... Frigid Fluid."</TE>
<TE>   No GHB was ever found during three searches of Luster's home in
July 2000. But prosecutors argue the six bottles are evidence of
Luster's propensity to knock out women and rape them. Defense
attorneys suggested in a pretrial motion that the little orange
bottles are irrelevant novelty items, and the labels merely a joke.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics mogul Max Factor, is
accused of using drugs to incapacitate three women before raping them
at his beach house. He is charged with multiple counts of rape of
intoxicated and unconscious women, as well as sexual battery,
poisoning, sodomy and drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys maintain that Luster engaged in consensual sex
with the purported victims.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the bottles taken from Luster's home, Peterson
testified that investigators seized a video camera and 17 videotapes,
which allegedly depict Luster raping two unconscious women in late
1996 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The defense insists that rogue officers tampered with evidence and
conducted a dishonest investigation. However, Superior Court Judge
Ken Riley has found no evidence of police misconduct and limited
inquiry into it.</TE>

<HD>'Two Towers,' 4,000 Readers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One read ruled them all.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of Los Angeles teens spent weeks reading "The Lord of
the Rings: The Two Towers," so they could be among the first
moviegoers to see the latest film based on the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy
and get a chance to win a trip to New Zealand, where the movie was
shot.</LD>
<LD>   But for county Probation Officer Wini Jackson, it was a chance to
create a fellowship of lifelong readers who might take their
attentions past Middle-earth and Frodo Baggins' journey to other
books.</LD>
<TE>   "If you raise the bar, the children will come up to the bar,"
Jackson said. "The whole country of New Zealand has just embraced
these kids with such vigor, it's amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson started the "Reading With a Purpose to Gain a Dream"
program last year when she enlisted 1,000 students to read the first
Tolkien book and be rewarded with a free screening of "The Fellowship
of the Ring."</TE>
<TE>   This year, 4,000 middle and high school students who read the
400-page "Two Towers", were treated to the film and met the New
Zealand consul-general, who delivered good wishes from his country's
prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   The students, mostly from southern Los Angeles County and ranging
in reading skills from remedial to honors level, got red-carpet
treatment Wednesday at Norwalk AMC Cinemas, along with popcorn, hot
dogs and soda.</TE>
<TE>   Ninth-grader Andrea Wu of Glen A. Wilson High School and
eighth-grade teacher Amber Dear of Cedarlane Middle School received
trips for two to the island country where the crew and director Peter
Jackson spent 18 months shooting principal photography for the three
movies of the story of Baggins' mission to destroy an evil ring.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by the county Department of Probation and Los Angeles
County Supervisor Don Knabe's office, the program involved several
companies and organizations that donated everything from the books to
the airfare and tours of the "Rings" filming sites.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about it is that it's about books, about reading,
whatever the incentive might be," Knabe said.</TE>
<TE>   Many who participated were at-risk or identified as having reading
problems. Some were from juvenile detention camps. But all shared a
genuine excitement for reading.</TE>
<TE>   "I would've read the book for no reason," said seventh-grader
Elgin Scott from St. Odilia Elementary School.</TE>

<HD>Court Won't Step Into City Council Battle</HD>
<DH>Judge refuses a Lake Forest councilwoman's request for a
restraining order against a colleague she says assaulted and insulted
her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying that bruising battles are simply part of being a politician, a
judge Wednesday refused to issue a restraining order to a Lake Forest
councilwoman who said a male council colleague assaulted her and
routinely insulted and mocked her.</LD>
<LD>   Councilwoman Kathryn McCullough's allegations that Peter Herzog --
a longtime colleague -- often shouted at her, stalked her at city
functions and once grabbed her arm so violently that she was forced
to wear a splint did not rise to the level of harassment, Judge Lyle
Robertson said.</LD>
<LD>   "When you put yourself in a public arena, there is often
conflict," Robertson said.</LD>
<TE>   Even if everything the councilwoman said was true, the judge said,
it still didn't demonstrate a pattern of dangerous conduct by Herzog.
He ordered McCullough to pay Herzog's $1,500 legal bill.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's court hearing left McCullough shaken and upset. She
fought tears while talking to reporters and afterward collapsed into
the arms of her family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "What this tells me is all you have to do is be a politician and
you can go and hurt somebody," McCullough, 60, said after the Laguna
Hills court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   During the proceeding, McCullough said she "didn't give up my
rights to be a citizen when I became a politician. If it had only
been a discussion of political issues, I'd have never had a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Herzog said he hopes he and McCullough can put this behind them.
"It should be clear now that it's time to move on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But McCullough isn't quite so willing to forgive and forget. She
said she plans to sue Herzog.</TE>

<HD>Zoning Change Dooms 446 Trees</HD>
<DH>A developer promises to plant 11,000 to replace those and
543 others that could stand in the way of an Orange County housing
project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the objections of environmentalists, Orange County planning
commissioners on Wednesday granted extensive zoning changes that will
allow large-scale grading and the removal of hundreds of oak and
sycamore trees from a scenic canyon area near Cleveland National
Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The changes were sought by Rutter Development Corp. of Irvine,
which plans to build 162 homes on two sites along Live Oak Canyon and
Santiago Canyon roads. The 598 acres are in the hills of eastern
Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   As a condition of the zoning change, the developer has promised to
relocate 47 of the healthiest trees and plant 11,000 seedlings,
acorns and smaller trees to compensate for the loss of 446 oaks and
sycamores. Rutter also has offered to dedicate 300 acres as permanent
open space.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a new way to keep the oak tree legacy going in Trabuco
Canyon," said Planning Commissioner Ben Nielsen. "Eleven thousand
trees will be great for future generations to see, and we need new
housing in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The commission voted 4 to 0 to amend the Trabuco Foothill Specific
Plan, a set of stringent zoning requirements designed to maintain the
natural resources and rural character of 6,000 acres in the area.
Commissioner Rick Goacher abstained, citing potential conflicts of
interest. The Board of Supervisors must endorse the revisions.</TE>
<TE>   County officials estimate that the Saddle Creek and Saddle Crest
projects could affect 1,036 of the 3,676 oak and sycamore trees in
the project area.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, 493 trees, all oaks except for 27, are in the grading
area and will have to be removed.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 543 trees, all oaks except for 30, might be affected
by construction activity because they are near the grading area.</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's public hearing, the vast majority of speakers
opposed the revisions because they would allow destruction of
hundreds of oaks and undermine existing zoning requirements for the
canyon and foothill areas.</TE>
<TE>   A few accused county planners of being more interested in
development than sound planning in order to solve the department's
financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   The county has proposed doubling builders' fees to staunch the
office's flow of red ink.</TE>
<TE>   Just before siding with the developer, commissioners chastised
some speakers for what they said were unfounded accusations against
the department.</TE>
<TE>   Then commission Chairman Chuck McBurney held up a loose-leaf
notebook containing the county's zoning ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing in the zoning code that cannot be amended,"
McBurney told the audience. "We are not trying to change the Bible
here."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Planning Director to Quit Amid Budget Deficit, Layoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's beleaguered planning director, faced with a financial
crisis in his department that has resulted in layoffs and a proposed
increase in building permit fees, announced Friday that he will
retire.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas B. Mathews, 59, is stepping down as the county grapples
with how to bring the department's budget into balance.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last six months, the department has spent at least $8
million more than it took in, and officials said it is operating at a
deficit of up to $1 million a month.</LD>
<TE>   Mathews' last day is Jan. 9, when 39 of the 200 employees in his
department will lose their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The Planning Department's financial woes have their roots in a
sharp decline in development fee revenue over the last few years as
the local economy cooled down. Planners wrongly predicted building
would pick up, and critics say they didn't do enough to trim costs.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing Mathews' exit, County Executive Officer Michael
Schumacher released an "action plan" Wednesday to reorganize the
department, including an internal audit of its budget procedures.</TE>

<HD>City Approves Sign Honoring Filipino Center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Ramos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved a
municipal sign in front of the Philippine Village Center in Eagle
Rock to recognize its contributions to the local Filipino community,
ending, at least for now, an acrimonious debate that has taken on
racial overtones.</LD>
<LD>   The city sign noting the presence of the "Philippine Village
Community Center," approved on a 13-0 vote, was a compromise from a
previous plan by local Filipino groups to designate a 1.3-mile
stretch of Eagle Rock Boulevard as "Philippine Village." That
proposal sparked outrage from local homeowners groups that did not
want any city signs that detracted from the Eagle Rock and Glassell
Park communities.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters said the honor would recognize the center as the heart
of the northeast's Filipino residents, who make up an estimated 18%
of the area's population. A newspaper, church, radio station, stores
and businesses catering to Filipinos are at the center at 4515 Eagle
Rock Blvd.</LD>
<TE>   But the idea sparked several emotional community meetings, at
which impatient outbursts and challenging questions of area Filipinos
dominated.</TE>
<TE>   At a gathering on Nov. 7, a fistfight nearly broke out as one
opponent challenged anyone to join him outside to settle the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Police were called to the scene, but no arrests were made.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nick Pacheco, who supported the compromise, said the
contentious two-month debate showed divisions among Filipinos and
others in the Northeast area that should be mended.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we can learn from this process," the councilman told his
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco, who is facing a reelection challenge next year from
former Assembly speaker and Los Angeles mayoral candidate Antonio
Villaraigosa, was praised by Councilman Nate Holden for coming up
with a plan that worked.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an acceptable compromise, a good compromise for all,"
Holden said.</TE>
<TE>   The unanimous action elicited cheers from about 20 Filipinos and
others in the council chamber for the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a wonderful Christmas gift for the Filipino people," said
Oscar Jornacion, the publisher of a Filipino weekly newspaper and the
head of the group seeking the designation.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there was opposition from two Eagle Rock residents,
who asked the council for either a delay or a "no" vote.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in Eagle Rock are up in arms about this," said Betty
Tyndall , a grandmother who has lived in Eagle Rock since 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle Rock is a diverse community where no particular ethnic group
should separate itself from the of the community, she said, noting,
"I've never seen any group come and ask for something like this [in
Eagle Rock]."</TE>
<TE>   Another resident, Marlene Schmidt, asked for a delay of the vote,
explaining that the compromise emerged at a meeting early last week
where only selected representatives of local groups, such as the
Eagle Rock Assn. and the Eagle Rock Chamber of Commerce, were
invited. Input from the wider community was needed before the council
voted, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In pushing the compromise, Pacheco told the meeting last week that
it was not unusual for the city to recognize various ethnic
communities, especially since the City Council has a penchant for
emphasizing the city's diversity.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that the council in recent years has bestowed
recognition on Little Armenia and Thai Town in East Hollywood and
Historic Filipinotown just west of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, many residents in the area opposed any designation.
Echoing the sentiments of many, Eagle Rock resident Roe Muzingo said:</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a melting pot, and we don't want to change it. I'm
Italian, OK? Italian is my heritage, but I'm an American. We
shouldn't be separated."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council gave preliminary approval Wednesday to a plan that
would extend the deadline for some Los Angeles businesses to pay new,
higher fees for police permits.</LD>
<LD>   But the council declined to delay the current Dec. 31 due date for
gun dealers.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said they have received hundreds of calls and
letters from holders of police permits protesting fee increases of
more than 1,000% in many cases. As a result, the council tentatively
agreed to extend the deadline for most payments from Dec. 31 to March
31 and to use the extra three months to revisit the question of
whether the fee increases are justified.</LD>
<TE>   The council asked the city attorney to draft an ordinance, which
must be approved on Friday for the delay to take effect.</TE>
<TE>   The delay was supported by pawnshop owners, who face an increase
in their police permit fees from $124 to $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This motion will save hundreds and hundreds of mom-and-pop
businesses across Los Angeles a real heartburn," said Ken Smith,
president of the Collateral Loan and Second-hand Dealers Assn. of
California.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Taylor, who has a shop in the San Fernando Valley, said the
city needs to show what costs warrant the fee. She said police have
reduced the number of officers who regularly monitor pawnshops.</TE>
<TE>   Police permit fees also are increasing for gun dealers, game
arcades, massage technicians, dance halls, auto parks, towing
operators and cafes with live entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss urged his colleagues not to delay the fee
increases for gun dealers, whose permit fees are set to go from $149
to $2,000. Defending the increase, Weiss cited the plague of gun
violence in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not vote for any measure that cuts a break to gun dealers
in this city," Weiss said. "I won't give them three extra months ...
three weeks. I won't give them three extra minutes."</TE>
<TE>   He said the fees are needed to ensure firearms dealers follow the
law.</TE>

<LD>Nancy thought her abusive boyfriend was part of her past.</LD>
<LD>   After he had repeatedly slapped and beaten her, she persuaded him
to move out of the house they shared with their two children, ages 5
and 6.</LD>
<LD>   She didn't know he was still secretly keeping tabs on her. When
Nancy began dating again, he started driving by the house and
threatened her over the phone. Then he broke into her house late one
night, frightening the children and demanding that she let him back
into her life.</LD>
<TE>   The next day, Nancy called the House of Ruth, a full-service
center for victims of domestic violence. House of Ruth, which
operates a shelter in the San Gabriel Valley, gave Nancy a temporary
place to stay, counseling for her and her children and help in
finding subsidized housing. Nancy (her name has been changed to
protect her identity) is back in school, learning a new trade.</TE>
<TE>   But Nancy's problems are not over. Her ex-boyfriend is now
demanding custody of the children.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the story of a lot of women here," said Barbara
Archambeau, director of residential services at House of Ruth. "They
don't always end up tied nicely with a happy bow."</TE>
<TE>   That is also true of House of Ruth, an organization that began 25
years ago with an idea cooked up by four women sitting around a
kitchen table. It has grown to include a staff of 50 employees, a
12,000-square-foot office building and a 55-bed shelter.</TE>
<TE>   But with a massive shortfall projected for the state budget and
cuts to social services expected in the federal budget, House of Ruth
officials worry that government funding will dwindle next year,
leading to cuts in services at the shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Besides temporary housing for women and their children, House of
Ruth offers counseling, a 24-hour hotline, (909) 988-5559, legal
assistance, job training and other help, all funded with government
grants and private donations. The group received $15,000 from last
year's Times Holiday Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "My vision for our facility is that a battered woman should be
able to walk in the door and get any service she needs," said Barbara
Hope, executive director of House of Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   During this holiday season, as part of an annual fund-raising
drive, The Times is highlighting groups that serve youths and
families in Southern California. Every dollar raised, plus matching
gifts from the McCormick Tribune Foundation, goes directly to such
agencies. The Times and the foundation absorb all administrative
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's appeal and matching funds raised $653,000, which was
allocated to more than 50 charities.</TE>

<HD>State of Disunion Speech: When Strife Makes Your Marriage a
Hasband</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mention was made here of librarian Cindy Mirallegro's laudatory
crusade to persuade dictionary publishers to accept "wasband" as a
word meaning ex-husband. But I thought she should go further and find
a word for ex-wife. Naturally, I couldn't think of one, so I appealed
to readers.</LD>
<LD>   And Howard Pratschler came to the rescue: "I always thought that
the best name for an ex-husband was 'hasband.' And an ex-wife was
'strife.' "</LD>
<LD>   Moving on to the in-laws: After her divorce, wrote Susan Lindley
of Claremont, she still harbored affection for her hasband's
"sibling, his sister-in-law, their children and even his parents.
These people I refer to as my 'out-laws.' " Lindley added that
because of her love of language, she gradually "began to think of my
former beloved as 'old spouse,' " which, "for both sexes might become
'old spice.' "</LD>
<TE>   And, finally: Larry Stirling suggested another term for ex-wife or
ex-hubby: "Insignificant other."</TE>
<TE>   Since we're on the subject of pains-in-the-neck: Heidi Ziegler of
Torrance found a device that evidently enables users to re-experience
their misery (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Mystery of the day: A colleague says "no one believed me" when she
explained that she was late for work because she had to stop her car
while the following procession passed her near Staples Center: an
LAPD battering ram, a vintage car driven by someone in a human-sized
"Stuart Little" mouse costume, some Auto Club vehicles and an LAPD
SWAT van.</TE>
<TE>   Then, again, another colleague asked her, this being L.A., why did
she assume that the vehicles were together?</TE>
<TE>   I checked and found out the vehicles were on their way to deliver
more than 2,000 Christmas presents to the children at L.A.
Orthopaedic Hospital, a worthy reason for a traffic halt if ever
there was one.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Pat Carlson of Long Beach questioned
whether a certain hobbled bathtub still deserved its title (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept (part deux): Guerin Barry of Westwood
noticed that the label on the can of tomato juice served on Northwest
Airlines flights said: "100% Tomato Juice with added ingredients."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Northwest is just trying to show that it gives 110%.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, security is a concern these days but ... Andy Ellis of
Fullerton came upon a fishing boat that's really loaded for bear, so
to speak (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Julie Moran of Pacific Palisades saw a church marquee
that read, "The Best Christmas Present Ever." Under that line there
was a sign that read, "Parking" with an arrow to a nearby lot. Which
pretty much sums up how valuable a parking place is in L.A. these
days.</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Decide Not to Sue Over Vote</HD>
<DH>Valley independence leaders consider seeking a change in
state law or a ballot initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secession leaders said Wednesday that they have decided against
filing a lawsuit to challenge the Nov. 5 election in which San
Fernando Valley cityhood was supported by a majority of Valley voters
but was overwhelmingly defeated citywide.</LD>
<LD>   The secession group Valley VOTE had considered challenging the
state law that required approval both by a majority of San Fernando
Valley voters and a majority of the total city electorate. But Valley
VOTE President Jeff Brain and Chairman Richard Close said that after
consulting with a number of attorneys, they decided that the chances
of winning in court would not outweigh the "disruption and
uncertainty that would exist within the city for a considerable
period of time."</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the secession leaders said they plan to seek state
legislation or an initiative to change the law to allow Valley
cityhood to be approved with a vote of just Valley residents.</LD>
<TE>   "We intend to work with the state Legislature to change this
unfair law," said Close. "We will also consider an initiative for
that purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Close said it appeared that the chances of success if his group
challenged the election were less than 50-50 and that it could have
dragged through the courts for one to three years, potentially
affecting the city's ability to issue bonds. The decision not to file
a lawsuit was made by Valley VOTE's five-member legal committee,
which agreed unanimously not to pursue a legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney John Isen, chairman of the legal committee, explained
that although there is legal precedent to challenge the existing law,
"the courts give a high degree of deference to the California state
Legislature in matters of this nature."</TE>
<TE>   Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at USC, said he saw no viable
grounds for challenging the citywide vote requirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they would have had any likelihood of prevailing,"
Chemerinsky said. "The reality is that state law is clear about the
procedures to be used in these kinds of elections."</TE>
<TE>   Added Valley political consultant Arnold Steinberg: "Courts almost
never set aside elections."</TE>
<TE>   The decision by secessionists not to go to court was welcomed by
Mayor James K. Hahn, who led the fight against secession. Still, Hahn
said he would work hard to defeat any attempt in Sacramento to change
state law in a way that would "take away the right of citizens to
vote on an important issue such as secession." Hahn has argued that
secession would affect all Los Angeles residents, so all should have
a vote.</TE>
<TE>   In order to change the law, secession advocates either would need
the support of the Legislature or would have to circumvent it by
taking an initiative directly to voters.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it might save time and money to get legislative
approval of a law change, Brain said it does not look as if the
current Legislature would be supportive of such a change.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that former Assemblyman Robert Hertzberg, who was helpful
in getting the secession vote on the ballot, has been replaced by
Lloyd Levine, the son of anti-secession leader Larry Levine.</TE>
<TE>   Brain also noted that current Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
campaigned against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to realistically recognize that the current makeup of the
Legislature is not conducive to that," Brain said of a law change.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is to collect 380,000 signatures of registered
voters in California to qualify a statewide initiative to change the
law, Brain said. He has talked to initiative qualifying companies and
been told such a petition effort would cost nearly $1 million, but
that it is realistic.</TE>

<HD>Judge Throws Splitter in Dispute Over Baseball</HD>
<DH>He rules two fans both own record-setting home run ball.
Neither one is pleased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Glionna and Maura Dolan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Who says there are no ties in baseball?</LD>
<LD>   A judge Wednesday ruled that Barry Bonds' record-setting 73rd home
run ball belongs to both fans who battled for the hunk of sports
history in the stands of a delirious PacBell Park last year. And
neither is happy about it.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Kevin McCarthy ordered that the scuffed ball,
with an estimated value of $1 million, be auctioned and the profits
split between Berkeley restaurant owner Alex Popov, who first touched
the ball as it flew into the right-field seats, and Sacramento
marketer Patrick Hayashi, who recovered it after a fierce rumble.</LD>
<TE>   The judge emphasized that Popov's attempts to hold onto the
coveted baseball were "interrupted by the collective assault of a
band of wrongdoers" who descended on him, making it impossible to
determine whether he had legal possession of his prize.</TE>
<TE>   "Judicial rulings, particularly in cases that receive media
attention, affect the way people conduct themselves," McCarthy wrote.
"This case demands a vindication of an important principle. We are a
nation governed by law, not by brute force."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers on both sides said they would study the judge's complex
12-page ruling before deciding whether to appeal. But nobody wasted
time putting their own spin on McCarthy's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that I had possession of that ball," fumed Hayashi.
"Now I'm going to have to go back and evaluate what the legal
definition of possession is."</TE>
<TE>   He said the judge's ruling proved that he did not attack Popov in
the scramble, and he insisted on an apology.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing doing, countered Popov outside the courtroom, suggesting
that he still held Hayashi partially responsible for yanking the
baseball from his glove during the much-publicized scrum. "He owes me
an apology."</TE>
<TE>   Contradicting his lawyer, Martin Triano, who called the ruling "a
victory for all fans," a disgruntled Popov insisted that the judge's
decision gives outright support to mob violence.</TE>
<TE>   All he ever wanted, Popov said, was to keep the baseball he
caught, a dream now very much in doubt. "It's a piece of baseball
history, a piece of San Francisco history and a piece of legal
history," he said. "The way I see it is that anything short of full
possession gives power to mob mentality and allows people to profit
from aggression."</TE>
<TE>   One baseball expert called McCarthy's ruling a contradictory end
to a case furthered by greed and selfishness.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's saying all they want is to touch history," said Paul
Zingg, provost at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and a baseball writer who
consulted on the Ken Burns PBS documentary "Baseball." "But the judge
is putting a value on anything that might allow someone to be part of
history. Where do you stop?"</TE>
<TE>   15-Day Trial</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy's ruling followed last month's 15-day trial, which
featured a retired major league umpire, a consultant with a degree in
biomedical engineering, a teenager who testified that he was bitten
in the battle for the baseball and four legal scholars who argued the
legal possession history of "fugitive baseballs."</TE>
<TE>   Popov, 38, contends that he legally caught the ball and lost it
only after being attacked by fans. Hayashi insists that he picked up
the ball after it rolled out of the press of bodies and that it
belongs to him. After the two sides failed to reach an out-of-court
settlement over the ball, which sits in an Alameda County bank safety
deposit box, McCarthy set the matter for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the case, the judge said, was who had possession of the
ball and when and how they could prove it. But despite 17
eyewitnesses and video footage showing Popov catching the ball and
holding it for 0.6 seconds before being descended on by fellow fans,
McCarthy said crucial evidence was nonetheless missing.</TE>
<TE>   "We will never know if Mr. Popov would have been able to retain
control of the ball had the crowd not interfered with his efforts to
do so," the judge said. "Resolution of that question is the work of a
psychic, not a judge."</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy, a baseball neophyte who says he has never been to
PacBell Park, nonetheless sounded like a play-by-play announcer as he
read his verdict on the events of Oct. 7, 2001. "Barry Bonds came to
bat in the first inning. With nobody on base and a full count, Bonds
swung at a slow knuckleball," he read to a courtroom packed with
reporters and supporters from each litigant. "He connected. The ball
sailed over the right-field fence and into the arcade."</TE>
<TE>   But then things went haywire.</TE>
<TE>   The judge described how the ball landed "in the upper portion of
the webbing of a softball glove" worn by Popov. "While the glove
stopped the trajectory of the ball, it is not at all clear that the
ball was secure. Popov had to reach for the ball and in doing so, may
have lost his balance."</TE>
<TE>   But the judge acknowledged how Popov was thrown to the floor and
buried under several bystanders as they clawed for the baseball. He
called the fans "a band of wrongdoers" and likened the melee to a
"collective assault." When Hayashi plucked the ball from the floor,
the ball already had "a cloud on its title," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   But McCarthy said it would be unfair to deny Hayashi the ball
because it is possible that Popov might not have caught it cleanly
even if he hadn't been thrown to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Hayashi was not a wrongdoer," McCarthy wrote. "He was a victim of
the same bandits that attacked Mr. Popov." And Hayashi, not Popov,
was the one who obtained "unequivocal dominion and control" over the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, McCarthy heard Popov's lawyers refer to
100-year-old whaling disputes, buried-ship-salvage cases and hunting
laws holding that, since mortally wounded animals often flee, a
shooter acquires possession upon the act of wounding an animal, not
at the eventual capture.</TE>
<TE>   But McCarthy on Wednesday waved away those references to cite
other legal precedents, including case law dating back to the 1880s
involving five boys who found a sock containing $775 along railroad
tracks in Elizabeth, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy said the court at the time ruled that "each boy had
possession of the sock at some point" before any of them knew that it
contained the money and that "each boy was entitled to an equal
share."</TE>
<TE>   In the months after the melee, Popov and Hayashi have been
criticized by baseball insiders, including Bonds, who has suggested
that the pair sell the ball and split the profits.</TE>
<TE>   But Donald Tamaki, a member of Hayashi's legal team, called the
judge's ruling "puzzling."</TE>
<TE>   "He made a ruling that is unprecedented in California law and even
in American law," he said. "Without controlling a piece of property
somehow you have a 'qualified pre-possessory interest in it.' The way
I see it, either you have it or you don't. It's like being half
pregnant -- either you are or you aren't. And so that concept of an
in-between right is actually new."</TE>
<TE>   Unruly Fans</TE>
<TE>   Law professor Paul Finkelman, who helped Popov's legal team, said
McCarthy's ruling rewards unruly fans at ballparks. "While this may
seem to be a Solomon-like decision -- cutting the baby in half --
what it does is say if you are involved in a mugging ... then you get
to profit from that."</TE>
<TE>   He complained that the judge did not follow through on the
evidence, particularly a video of the so-called catch.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence shows the ball is in Popov's hands," said Finkelman,
a Chapman Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Tulsa
College of the Law. "This rewards essentially those who would commit
violence at the ballpark."</TE>
<TE>   Both Popov and Hayashi acknowledged that the legal fight has
changed them. Popov joined a Christian fellowship group. Hayashi quit
his job at Cisco Systems and moved to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no joy in Mudville, or San Francisco, for that
matter, Wednesday as neither man was ready to shake hands and move
on.</TE>
<TE>   "I had talked with friends about having a party and enjoying this
baseball," Popov said. "Now that will have to wait."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hayashi: "Who would have thought? I go to the ballpark for a
good time and end up in court."</TE>

<HD>Instead of an Award, a Burial</HD>
<DH>Classmates raise funds for the funeral of an Oxnard
fourth-grader who died of leukemia.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Had she lived, Sarahi Cuecuecha would have received her classroom's
perseverance award this week.</LD>
<LD>   The 9-year-old with a wide, crooked smile was always first in line
each morning to get into her Oxnard classroom. She never forgot to
turn in her homework. And her classmates loved her.</LD>
<LD>   But she didn't get the chance to walk to the front of her class to
be honored.</LD>
<TE>   Sarahi died Monday at Ventura County Medical Center after a
two-year struggle with leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   "She was just the best," said her fourth-grade teacher, Isabel
Olachea. "No matter what she was facing, she came to school each
morning eager to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Now her parents want to send their daughter's body for burial to
their native Tlaxcala state in central Mexico. But the couple, a
restaurant dishwasher and a stay-at-home mom, can't pay the $3,200
funeral and shipping costs.</TE>
<TE>   So Sarahi's teacher, classmates and supporters all the way up to
the superintendent are rallying to raise money for the family,
helping them through the most trying of times.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seemed like they needed a hand," said Oxnard Elementary
Supt. Richard Duarte, announcing Wednesday that the school district's
nonprofit educational foundation would take the fund-raising lead.
"It's a difficult time for them, and if we in a small way can help,
we want to try."</TE>
<TE>   Although she was born in Ventura, Sarahi lived in Tlaxcala for
several years before her parents, Amado and Cristina, brought her
back to the United States a few years ago in search of better medical
care.</TE>
<TE>   Through tears in her sparse Oxnard living room, a place of family
photos and a Christmas tree without gifts, Cristina Cuecuecha said
they didn't know Sarahi had leukemia until they took her to Childrens
Hospital in Los Angeles two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Cuecuecha said her dark-haired little girl was brave when she
learned she had the disease, traveling as often as once a week to
L.A. for chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Cuecuecha said her daughter seemed to be handling the grueling
regimen just fine. She was looking forward to Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   But Sunday, after she lost her appetite and complained of pain,
her parents rushed her to the Ventura public hospital and learned her
body was ravaged by infection. She died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that turned from one day to the next," the
mother said, sobbing. "She was a very intelligent girl, a little girl
who smiled easily and loved to read and write. She is going to be
missed by her entire family."</TE>
<TE>   She leaves behind two sisters and a brother.</TE>
<TE>   She also will be missed at Elm Street School in south Oxnard,
where her classmates have started collecting money in a glass jar to
help the family pay funeral expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained to them the parents didn't have any money, and they
just started pulling money out of their pockets and putting it in the
jar," Olachea said of her fourth- and fifth-grade students. The
youngsters also wrote notes to Sarahi's parents, saying they were
sorry for the couple's loss.</TE>
<TE>   Olachea said Sarahi was new to the school this year after being
home-schooled for two years. The teacher said the girl was happy to
be out of the house and making friends, even though she was shy about
removing the hats she wore to cover short hair that came after
chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Sarahi regularly missed Thursdays to make those chemotherapy
appointments, but often was back in her seat the next day ready to
work, the teacher said. Then, last Friday, she wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "It's heartbreaking, it really is," Olachea said. "I just didn't
expect this to happen. She never acted sick. She always looked so
happy."</TE>
<TE>   Contributions can be made in care of the Cuecuecha family to the
Oxnard Elementary School District Educational Foundation, P.O. Box
623, Oxnard CA 93031.</TE>

<HD>Drunk Driving Battle Gains</HD>
<DH>California's alcohol- related fatality rate is near the
bottom among states, study says, after one of the biggest 20-year
declines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California has fewer drunk driving deaths per miles driven than all
but a few states in the nation and has posted one of the biggest
drops in the fatality rate in the last 20 years, according to a
federal study released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Between 1982 and 2001, the rate of drunk driving deaths in
California dropped 70%, from 165 fatalities per 1 million miles
driven to 50 deaths, according to a new study by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Based on these statistics, California ranks among such states as
Utah, Vermont, Minnesota, New Jersey and New York in claiming the
lowest drunk driving fatality rates. Nationwide, the drunk driving
rate has declined 62% since 1982.</LD>
<TE>   The national and state-by-state data have been available
previously but never compiled into a single report, NHTSA officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was released as part of a nationwide campaign against
drunk driving, billed as the longest crackdown of its kind, beginning
Friday and running through Jan. 5. In California, police agencies
promise to launch more sobriety checkpoints and increase enforcement
on roads and freeways over the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Impaired drivers represent one of our nation's greatest threats,"
NHTSA administrator Jeffrey Runge said during a news conference at
the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. The event was held in the
20,000-seat stadium to demonstrate the sheer number of people killed
annually by drunk drivers. Last year, 17,448 deaths were attributed
to drinking and driving.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic safety experts say the decline in deaths stems from a
combination of factors, including strong police enforcement, tougher
penalties for people who drink and drive, better automobile safety
equipment and a slew of educational campaigns by such groups as
Mothers Against Drunk Driving.</TE>
<TE>   Key factors in the drop could be the improvement of equipment such
as seat belts, airbags and car seats for children, as well as
improved emergency response techniques, said Mark A.R. Kleiman, a
UCLA professor of public policy and expert on substance abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 20 years, motorists who drink and drive have also
faced tougher penalties, including losing their driving privileges,
paying stiff fines and spending more time behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these things work together to change society's attitude"
about drunk driving, said California Highway Patrol spokesman Steve
Kohler.</TE>
<TE>   MADD was launched in 1980 and has since established chapters in
every state, plus offices in England and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   But MADD officials, noting that the number of drunk driving deaths
in California has risen slightly since 1997, worry that motorists are
becoming complacent about the problem. Last year, the state had 1,569
alcohol-related traffic deaths, compared with 1,348 in 1997, a 16%
increase.</TE>
<TE>   "The public in general may view drunk driving as a solved
problem," said Reidel Post, who is executive director of the Orange
County chapter of MADD.</TE>
<TE>   The release of the NHTSA study and the drunk driving crackdown
were timed for the holiday season, a period in which more than 46
million Americans are expected to travel by car, according to the
Automobile Club of America.</TE>

<CX>   Drunk-driving deaths -- An article in Thursday's California section
miscalculated the rate of alcohol-related deaths in California. The
rate has dropped from 1.65 deaths per 100 million miles traveled to
0.50 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between 1982 and 2001. The
story and an accompanying chart incorrectly stated the rate as
falling from 165 deaths to 50 deaths per 1 million miles driven.</CX>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Brushing aside the recommendation of its own legal
staff, a lame-duck State Board of Equalization voted Wednesday to
give the insurance industry a tax break that will cost California's
financially troubled state government about $220 million in revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous decision of the five-member board -- three of whom
will leave office in January -- was a victory for companies that
write workers' compensation policies and a slap at a sister state
agency, the Department of Insurance, which had recently assessed the
tax.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after the vote, Insurance Commissioner Harry Low issued a
statement saying he believed that the board had erred in its decision
and would urge Commissioner-elect John Garamendi, who takes office in
January, to appeal it.</LD>
<TE>   The importance of the decision was heightened by an announcement
from Gov. Gray Davis an hour before that the severity of the state's
fiscal condition has worsened dramatically. A revenue shortage
believed to be about $21 billion had climbed to about $34.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But equalization board members said they could not condone a tax
that was being imposed on the industry retroactively and without a
public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "They should not just be hit with this cold," said board member
Johan Klehs. "It seems there is something inherently unfair about
that."</TE>
<TE>   The core of the dispute is an arcane tax of 2.35% -- called the
gross premiums tax -- that insurance companies pay on the premiums
they collect for providing various coverage. It became an issue for
state officials when a 1995 law allowed workers' compensation
carriers -- those who provide coverage for injured workers -- to
offer cheaper policies to businesses that agreed to reimburse them
for claims up to a specified amount.</TE>
<TE>   Larry White, senior staff counsel for the department, said at the
time that then-Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush was advised by his
legal staff that these reimbursements made by businesses to insurance
companies should be taxed as part of the premium. But, he said,
Quackenbush decided not to impose that portion of the tax.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing the law, Low, a former appellate court judge who
succeeded Quackenbush, concluded that the full tax should have been
imposed and advised insurance companies that they owed the additional
tax retroactive to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The department estimated that the revenue from the retroactive tax
payments would provide $220 million to the state to help pay for such
things as schools, prisons and social services. In future years, it
would bring the state about $50 million in additional revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The industry immediately filed a protest with the Board of
Equalization, an elected body that administers several of the state's
taxes and hears appeals on tax issues.</TE>
<TE>   Many large businesses joined insurers in urging the board to
overrule the Department of Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "This change in tax policy could not have come at a worse time for
California businesses and employees," a vice president for
Dallas-based Southwest Airlines wrote the board.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposed change will significantly increase the financial
burden of doing business in California," the executive added.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Martland, a lawyer for Wausau Business Insurance Co.,
argued that the Legislature never intended for the industry to pay a
tax on the reimbursements and warned the board that any additional
tax imposed on insurers would be passed on to businesses and
corporations like Southwest Airlines that already are reeling from a
sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real hit on the employer, which I don't think the
Legislature intended," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The board's legal staff disagreed, saying that its analysis of the
law showed that it should rule against the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We conclude the ... reimbursements are part of gross premiums and
subject to tax," its legal staff advised in a nine-page
recommendation.</TE>

<HD>Smuggler to Pay for Pocketing Monkeys</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert John Cusack smuggled a pair of endangered pygmy monkeys into
the United States. In his pants.</LD>
<LD>   On June 13, Ho Truong, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special
agent, was called to Los Angeles International Airport after Cusack
was stopped by U.S. Customs agents on arrival from Thailand.</LD>
<LD>   Officials soon discovered that Cusack, 45, had four endangered
birds of paradise and 50 protected orchids with him.</LD>
<TE>   "When one of the inspectors opened up his luggage, one of the
birds flew out," Truong said. "He had to go catch the bird."</TE>
<TE>   After finding the other purloined birds and exotic flowers, the
inspectors asked, "Do you have anything else you should tell us
about?"</TE>
<TE>   According to Truong, Cusack answered, "Yes, I've got monkeys in my
pants."</TE>
<TE>   They patted Cusack down to check for weapons, then asked for the
loris, rare primates native to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   "He had them in a little pouch in his pants," Truong said. "We've
had a couple of monkey cases before, but this was the only time where
somebody's stuck monkeys down his pants."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Johns said people illegally import
"sturgeon -- you know, caviar -- jaguar pelts, sea turtles -- their
eggs are very big with the Central American community -- reptiles,
including Komodo dragons, elephant tusks, songbirds ... and illegally
harvested fish."</TE>
<TE>   He said the black market in wildlife is the world's second
largest, trailing only narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Cusack pleaded guilty to smuggling the tiny primates,
which are more closely related to lemurs than to monkeys, and was
sentenced by U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in Los Angeles. Cusack
had tried to bring the contraband wildlife into the country without
proper permits.</TE>
<TE>   Cusack was sentenced to 57 days in jail, time already served.</TE>
<TE>   And under a plea agreement, he was ordered to donate more than
$11,500 to a Texas facility for primates and to pay more than $3,000
for the primates' board while quarantined at the International Center
for Gibbon Studies in Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   The big-eyed, stubby-tailed creatures about the size of a furry
baseball are now in the nursery at the Los Angeles Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Cusack told federal agents that he had bought the pair in a market
in Indonesia and that he had kept them in his carry-on until four
hours or so before the flight was to land. He then decided to move
them into his pants.</TE>
<TE>   "His story was that, even though he's an American citizen, he had
moved to Costa Rica, and he claimed that he had a wildlife sanctuary
there, and these animals were for his wildlife sanctuary," Truong
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cusack's lawyer, Dominic Cantalupo of Santa Monica, said his
client did not respond to messages Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Cantalupo said Cusack lives in Orange County but formerly lived in
Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney described him as an environmentalist who "up to the
point where he was arrested, lived a law-abiding life and then made
an unwise, spontaneous and emotional decision to bring in the
animals, birds and plants he was caught with."</TE>
<TE>   Cantalupo said his client expressed remorse in court on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He recognized the foolishness and impulsiveness of what he tried
to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johns said Cusack's was one of dozens of "critter cases" his
environmental crimes section prosecutes every year.</TE>
<TE>   At the zoo, the loris have gained weight on a diet of fruit and
vegetables, mealworms and grubs.</TE>
<TE>   The male, which has had some dental work done, will weigh about a
pound when fully grown, the female somewhat less, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing really well," said Jennie McNary, the zoo's curator
of mammals. The animals were 3 or 4 months old when confiscated in
June, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She speculated that they survived their stay in Cusack's pants
relatively well "because they're so small and nocturnal."</TE>
<TE>   There was no happy ending for the four smuggled birds of paradise.
All four have died.</TE>

<HD>Priests Begin Public Penance in O.C.</HD>
<DH>Sixteen clerics perform acts of contrition meant to
apologize for their colleagues' sex abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first public penance by Roman Catholic priests since the
church's national sex scandal broke 11 months ago, 16 clerics in
Santa Ana began Wednesday to perform acts of contrition suggested by
molestation victims.</LD>
<LD>   Under the glare of television lights and before a crowd of
reporters from as far away as Boston, the priests met at a homeless
shelter to decide how to show they are sorry for what some of their
brethren have done. Many undertook their penances right away; one
read stories to children in the shelter, and others did without their
cars for the day. Today, Father Steve Sallot plans to work as a
janitor's assistant at his parish's parochial school in Dana Point.</LD>
<LD>   One participant, Father Leo Celano, acknowledged that some may see
the gesture as a publicity stunt. "People will think that we're
grandstanding," he said. But no matter what, "we're responsible for
apologizing" for the actions of some in the clergy.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of a [national] grass-roots movement by
local priests, which is very moving," said Father Joseph Palacios, a
Georgetown University professor who said he attended the meeting as
both a cleric and a sociologist studying the movement.</TE>
<TE>   Palacios said the event, held at a homeless shelter run by the
independent Catholic Worker organization, was the first public
spiritual response taken by U.S. priests to reach out to victims of
sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "The American priesthood is in crisis on many levels," said
Palacios, adding that clerics and others tend to blame something
impersonal: "It's the Vatican. It's the bishops. It's celibacy. These
priests here are showing a deeper level of our own responsibility at
the parish level."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the public penances performed or promised by priests who
attended, the single victim of sexual abuse who showed up at the
meeting said it was the two words spoken by Celano that meant the
most.</TE>
<TE>   Ending an awkward silence that developed as a dozen priests met
with Mary Ferrell, a 54-year-old nurse from Lakewood, Celano told
her: "We apologize." Tears immediately flooded her eyes. "It was what
I came to hear," said Ferrell after the meeting. She alleged that a
now-dead priest from a San Pedro parish had molested her beginning at
age 7. "I don't understand why the rest [of the church] doesn't get
it."</TE>
<TE>   Celano is a Norbertine priest from St. Michael's Abbey in
Silverado Canyon in south Orange County. His penance for Wednesday
was to give up his car and use only public transportation, causing
him to wonder if bus service ran out to his abbey. "It's going to be
a dreadful price if we don't do this," he said. "We don't have a
choice."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the public penances came from two Orange County
priests, John McAndrew and Bill Barman, who said they had grown tired
of blaming others for the church's sexual abuse scandal. Last month,
they decided to dig out a centuries-old spiritual tool, the public
penance, in hopes of showing victims and others that some in the
clergy understand the depth of the wounds inflicted on victims by the
church. Their hope was for the public penances to be performed
throughout the country in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "Long after this scandal recedes in memory and all the lawsuits
are settled, the wound to the Body of Christ will remain," McAndrew
said. "We who are called to minister as priests recommit ourselves to
this ministry of reconciliation."</TE>
<TE>   Initial publicity seeking penance suggestions resulted in about
100 calls, one from as far away as Alaska, to a makeshift hotline at
the Catholic Worker. Many were from people who said they were victims
of sexual abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   "I really felt on holy ground every time I answered the phone,"
said Leia Smith, who took many of the calls.</TE>
<TE>   After an initial media briefing Wednesday, the priests met
privately to sing a hymn, pray and then consider their acts of
contrition.</TE>
<TE>   Among the suggestions displayed on slips of paper on a wood table
that also held a lighted candle and Bible: Forgo alcohol for one
year, since in many of the abuse cases, alcohol was a factor. Wear
clerical attire to a shopping mall where the priests may encounter
hostile stares and comments. Get clothes from a Catholic charity to
wear for a day and give your favorite clothes to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Soto, auxiliary bishop for the Orange diocese, said he vowed
two penances: One, to pray the rosary each Friday with the victims in
mind. And two, to lead question-and-answer sessions about the
sexual-abuse scandal at all Orange County Catholic high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Soto said he and the others often faced this question from
parishioners: Why didn't you know?</TE>
<TE>   "The pain of what our brother priests have done, and the pain of
our negligence or blindness is very palpable here," Soto said.</TE>
<TE>   Father James Reis of St. Irenaeus Church in Cypress said he took
part in the public penance in hopes of making parishes once again
places of refuge.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make the church safe again," he said. "If someone's
home or neighborhood isn't safe, the church has always been. People
need a safe place to go."</TE>
<TE>   Handed out to the priests at the meeting was a card carrying the
words of St. Francis of Assisi: "We have been called to heal wounds,
to unite what has broken apart, and to bring home those who have lost
their way."</TE>

<HD>Court Won't Step Into City Council Battle</HD>
<DH>Judge refuses a Lake Forest councilwoman's request for a
restraining order against a colleague she says assaulted her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying that bruising battles are simply part of being a politician, a
judge Wednesday refused to issue a restraining order to a Lake Forest
councilwoman who said a male council colleague assaulted her and
routinely insulted and mocked her.</LD>
<LD>   Councilwoman Kathryn McCullough's allegations that Peter Herzog --
a longtime colleague -- often shouted at her, stalked her at city
functions and once grabbed her arm so violently that she was forced
to wear a splint did not rise to the level of harassment, Judge Lyle
Robertson said.</LD>
<LD>   "When you put yourself in a public arena, there is often
conflict," Robertson said.</LD>
<TE>   Even if everything the councilwoman said was true, the judge said,
it still didn't demonstrate a pattern of dangerous conduct by Herzog.
He ordered McCullough to pay Herzog's $1,500 legal bill.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough has had a chilly relationship with some of her council
colleagues over the years. When she was passed over for mayor several
times -- a ceremonial post that traditionally rotates among the five
council members -- some of her supporters suggested Herzog and others
opposed her because she is black.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, an ordained minister, was elected mayor in 2001.
Herzog and Councilman Richard Dixon voted in opposition, both
vehemently denying that race anything to do with their vote.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's court hearing left McCullough shaken and upset. She
fought tears while talking to reporters and afterward collapsed into
the arms of her family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "What this tells me is all you have to do is be a politician and
you can go and hurt somebody," McCullough, 60, said after the Laguna
Hills court hearing. "This just proves there is no justice unless you
have money and power."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Farnell, Herzog's attorney, had a different
interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "He said basically that 'you're engaging in privileged conduct in
a political arena,' " Farnell said. "In fact, he said it's [Herzog's]
obligation to do that."</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, McCullough said she "didn't give up my rights
to be a citizen when I became a politician. If it had only been a
discussion of political issues, I'd have never had a problem."</TE>
<TE>   In a four-page petition filed before the Nov. 5 election,
McCullough said she was shouted at by Herzog during a California
League of Cities reception July 25 in Monterey and then had her arm
"grabbed and pulled" by Herzog after a Sept. 17 council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   She also complained of being stalked by Herzog at city functions.</TE>
<TE>   Herzog, who did not speak during the hearing, said he hopes he and
McCullough can put this behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be clear now that it's time to move on," he said.
"We've both been reelected to serve the people."</TE>
<TE>   But McCullough, who had a splint on her wrist from the alleged
physical assault of Sept. 17, said she isn't quite so willing to
forgive and forget. She said she plans to file a lawsuit against
Herzog.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never wanted a dime from him," McCullough said. "I just want
him to leave me alone."</TE>

<LD>A judge Wednesday ordered jurors in the criminal trial of South Gate
Treasurer Albert Robles to keep deliberating after they reported
being deadlocked on all seven felony counts.</LD>
<LD>   Robles, 37, is charged with threatening to kill two state
legislators, a political consultant and a South Gate police
lieutenant. The 10-man, two-woman jury, after five hours of
deliberations, said they had taken about 13 ballots and had failed to
reach a verdict. All of the votes were consistent except for one,
they said.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge John A. Torribio told the jurors to return
this morning after both prosecutors and defense attorneys requested
that the panel keep deliberating.</LD>
<TE>   Torribio refused a request from Robles' attorney, Thomas Brown,
for a vote count. He said he would ask for such information only if
he declares a mistrial.</TE>

<HD>Zoning Change OKd; 446 Trees to Be Lost to Homes</HD>
<DH>Saddle Crest, Creek developer vows to plant 11,000 to
replace those and others that could stand in project's way.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the objections of environmentalists, Orange County planning
commissioners on Wednesday granted extensive zoning changes that will
allow large-scale grading and the removal of hundreds of oak and
sycamore trees from a scenic canyon area near Cleveland National
Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The changes were sought by Rutter Development Corp. of Irvine,
which plans to build 162 homes on two sites along Live Oak Canyon and
Santiago Canyon roads. The 598 acres are in the hills of eastern
Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   As a condition of the zoning change, the developer has promised to
relocate 47 of the healthiest trees and plant 11,000 seedlings,
acorns and smaller trees to compensate for the loss of 446 oaks and
sycamores. Rutter also has offered to dedicate 300 acres as permanent
open space.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a new way to keep the oak tree legacy going in Trabuco
Canyon," said Planning Commissioner Ben Nielsen. "Eleven thousand
trees will be great for future generations to see, and we need new
housing in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The commission voted 4 to 0 to amend the Trabuco Foothill Specific
Plan, a set of stringent zoning requirements designed to maintain the
natural resources and rural character of 6,000 acres in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Rick Goacher abstained, citing potential conflicts of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Board of Supervisors must endorse the revisions.</TE>
<TE>   County officials estimate that the Saddle Creek and Saddle Crest
projects could affect 1,036 of the 3,676 oak and sycamore trees in
the project area.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, 493 trees, all oaks except for 27, are in the grading
area and will have to be removed. An additional 543 trees, all oaks
except for 30, might be affected by construction activity because
they are near the grading area.</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's public hearing, the vast majority of speakers
opposed the revisions because they would allow destruction of
hundreds of oaks and undermine existing zoning requirements for the
canyon and foothill areas.</TE>
<TE>   A few accused county planners of being more interested in
development than sound planning in order to solve the department's
financial problems. The county has proposed doubling builders' fees
to staunch the office's flow of red ink.</TE>
<TE>   "If this flies, it will be unfair to previous [builders] and to
residents who expect government to keep the promises it made in
1991," said Ray Chandos, an activist from Trabuco Canyon. "This could
set a disastrous precedent."</TE>
<TE>   Adam Smith, chairman of the Trabuco Foothill Specific Plan Review
Committee, likened the zoning changes to owning a Ferrari that goes
150 mph when the maximum speed limit is 65.</TE>
<TE>   "If I talk to the right people, I can get the limit changed for
me," Smith told the commission. "This should be met with severe
scrutiny. Our recommendation is no. Your recommendation should be
no."</TE>
<TE>   Testimony became so heated that commission Chairman Chuck McBurney
threatened to cut off John Sefton of Trabuco Canyon, who accused the
planning department of potential conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Sefton also described Planning Director Thomas Mathews as an enemy
of Trabuco Canyon responsible for the "wholesale butchery of the
area's heritage."</TE>
<TE>   Mathews announced his resignation Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Just before siding with the developer, commissioners chastised
some speakers for what they said were unfounded accusations against
the department.</TE>
<TE>   Then McBurney held up a loose-leaf notebook containing Orange
County's zoning ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing in the zoning code that cannot be amended,"
McBurney told the audience. "We are not trying to change the Bible
here."</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Decide Not to Sue Over Vote</HD>
<DH>Valley independence leaders consider seeking a change in
state law or a ballot initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secession leaders said Wednesday that they have decided against
filing a lawsuit to challenge the Nov. 5 election in which San
Fernando Valley cityhood was supported by a majority of Valley voters
but was overwhelmingly defeated citywide.</LD>
<LD>   The secession group Valley VOTE had considered challenging the
state law that required approval both by a majority of San Fernando
Valley voters and a majority of the total city electorate. But Valley
VOTE president Jeff Brain and chairman Richard Close said that after
consulting with a number of attorneys, they decided that the chances
of winning in court would not outweigh the "disruption and
uncertainty that would exist within the city for a considerable
period of time."</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the secession leaders said they plan to seek state
legislation or an initiative to change the law to allow Valley
cityhood to be approved with only a vote of Valley residents.</LD>
<TE>   "We intend to work with the state Legislature to change this
unfair law," said Close. "We will also consider an initiative for
that purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Close said it appeared the chances of success if his group
challenged the election were less than 50-50 and it could have
dragged through the courts for one to three years, potentially
affecting the city's ability to issue bonds. The decision not to file
a lawsuit was made by Valley VOTE's five-member legal committee,
which agreed unanimously not to pursue a legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney John Isen, chairman of the legal committee, explained
that although there is legal precedent to challenge the existing law,
"the courts give a high degree of deference to the California state
Legislature in matters of this nature."</TE>
<TE>   Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at USC, said he saw no viable
grounds for challenging the citywide vote requirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they would have had any likelihood of prevailing,"
Chemerinsky said. "The reality is that state law is clear about the
procedures to be used in these kinds of elections."</TE>
<TE>   Added Valley political consultant Arnold Steinberg, "Courts almost
never set aside elections."</TE>
<TE>   The decision by secessionists not to go to court was welcomed by
Mayor James K. Hahn, who led the fight against secession. Still, Hahn
said he would work hard to defeat any attempt in Sacramento to change
state law in a way that would "take away the right of citizens to
vote on an important issue such as secession." Hahn has argued that
secession would affect all Los Angeles residents, so all should have
a vote.</TE>
<TE>   In order to change the law, secession advocates either would need
the support of the Legislature or would have to circumvent it by
taking an initiative directly to voters.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it might save time and money to get legislative
approval of a law change, Brain said it does not look as if the
current Legislature would be supportive of such a change.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that former Assemblyman Robert Hertzberg, who was helpful
in getting the secession vote on the ballot, has been replaced by
Lloyd Levine, the son of anti-secession leader Larry Levine.</TE>
<TE>   Brain also noted that current Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
campaigned against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to realistically recognize that the current makeup of the
Legislature is not conducive to that," Brain said of the law change.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is to collect 380,000 signatures of registered
voters in California to qualify a statewide initiative to change the
law, Brain said. He has talked to initiative qualifying companies and
been told such a petition effort would cost nearly $1 million but
that it is realistic.</TE>
<TE>   Close noted that Valley VOTE collected 202,000 signatures from
just Valley voters to qualify secession for the ballot, so secession
leaders believe they could gather the number needed to put the matter
on a state ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very confident we could do it if we have to, but that is
not the preferred method," Close said. "The preferred method is to
have the state Legislature change the law."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), who received the most
votes for mayor of the proposed Valley city, said he has held
preliminary talks with Valley VOTE leaders about introducing a bill
to change the requirement on secession votes, but wants to spend more
time reviewing the constitutional and voting-rights issues involved
before deciding whether to write legislation.</TE>

<HD>Woman Held in Child's Abduction</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman charged with kidnapping a child last year was arrested
Wednesday for allegedly abducting another toddler, whom police
recovered apparently unharmed in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't eaten, I haven't slept in days," Katrina Brown said
after she was reunited with her daughter. "I've been up for four
days."</LD>
<LD>   Rochelle Garrett, 29, acting as a baby-sitter for 2-year-old
Shanyia Payton, agreed to keep her until Sunday afternoon, police
said. She was supposed to return Shanyia to her mother at San Pedro
and 6th streets, but did not show up.</LD>
<TE>   "A citizen saw a woman and child matching the description given
out on a television broadcast at a Santa Monica hotel and tipped us
off," LAPD Det. Paula Garcia said. "We made an arrest for kidnapping
and took another man accompanying her in for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   "The child was in good condition."</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, Garrett was charged with kidnapping for taking a
child from a homeless center in central Los Angeles. Four months
later, she pleaded guilty to deprivation of custody, and the
kidnapping charge was dropped as part of a plea bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Tamara Hall asked the judge to approve the
deal. Garrett entered a no-contest plea. Hall did not return calls
Wednesday</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Anita H.
Dymant placed Garrett on three years' probation on condition that she
not associate with any child without adult supervision.</TE>
<TE>   She also was told to report to a mental health center within five
days of her probation, records show.</TE>
<TE>   She was later jailed, from July to September, for violating
probation. She was accused of disrupting court proceedings in the San
Gabriel Valley, and refusing to leave after police escorted her out
of a courthouse. When Garrett admitted Sept. 26 that she had violated
probation, Dymant released her on her own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 9, Dymant reinstated Garrett's probation after she agreed
to undergo psychiatric counseling, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   Dymant declined to comment Wednesday. Garrett's court-appointed
lawyer didn't return a call.</TE>

<HD>New Road Plan Could Save Ancient Oak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tree sitter John Quigley is used to donations of food and supplies.</LD>
<LD>   Now a local engineer has donated his services to Quigley's
campaign to save a 400-year-old oak on Pico Canyon Road near Santa
Clarita. Quigley has remained perched in the tree for nearly two
months to protest a road-widening project that calls for the oak's
removal.</LD>
<LD>   Flanked by environmental supporters gathered in front of the
towering oak, Valencia-based structural engineer J. Brent Hoerner on
Wednesday unveiled a proposal that would split the roadway in two,
leaving a narrow pocket in the middle for the tree.</LD>
<TE>   Hoerner said the new lanes would be elevated 18 inches by pylons
to protect the tree's roots and allow water to reach the soil. Under
the proposal, the westbound lane would curve around the north end of
the tree, separated by at least a 30-foot buffer.</TE>
<TE>   The elevated stretches would be 200 feet long and drivers could
maintain a speed of 55 mph. The project's cost could reach $2.5
million, about three times more expensive than a regular road,
Hoerner said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something I thought I could help with," said Hoerner, a
professional engineer for three decades. "This oak stands as a symbol
of trees all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Rattazzi, president of John Laing Homes, which is required to
widen the road as part of its building permit for a new subdivision,
said he had not seen Hoerner's proposal. But he said the company is
working with the county to come up with a resolution.</TE>
<TE>   He said moving the tree to a neighboring park site as proposed
earlier is still "a very real possibility." Such a move would cost at
least $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We're continuing to take a look at what's doable," Rattazzi said.
"We're going to be practical. We're not just going to throw things up
against the wall to see what sticks."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Pullman, a spokesman for the county Department of Public
Works, said that Hoerner's plan would be considered, but added that
relocation of the tree remains the most attractive solution.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley and his supporters have rejected the relocation plan,
saying the tree is too old and too large to survive a transplant.</TE>
<TE>   The tree, dubbed Old Glory by environmentalists, was slated to be
cut down to expand Pico Canyon Road from two to four lanes. Quigley
thwarted the plans by climbing up the tree seven weeks ago in
protest.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, environmentalists have rejected proposals to move the
oak, but are now backing plans such as Hoerner's to build a road
around it.</TE>

<TE>   Hoerner said the new lanes would be elevated 18 inches by pylons
to protect the tree's roots and allow water to reach the soil. Under
the proposal, the westbound lane would curve around the north end of
the tree, separated by at least a 30-foot buffer.</TE>
<TE>   The elevated stretches would be 200 feet long and drivers could
maintain a speed of 55 mph. The project's cost could reach $2.5
million, about three times more expensive than a regular road,
Hoerner said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something I thought I could help with," said Hoerner, a
professional engineer for three decades. "This oak stands as a symbol
of trees all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Rattazzi, president of John Laing Homes, which is required to
widen the road as part of its building permit for a new subdivision,
said he had not seen Hoerner's proposal. But he said the company is
working with the county to come up with a resolution.</TE>
<TE>   He said moving the tree to a neighboring park site as proposed
earlier is still "a very real possibility." Such a move would cost at
least $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We're continuing to take a look at what's doable," Rattazzi said.
"We're going to be practical. We're not just going to throw things up
against the wall to see what sticks."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Pullman, a spokesman for the county Department of Public
Works, said that Hoerner's plan would be considered, but added that
relocation of the tree remains the most attractive solution.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley and his supporters have rejected the relocation plan,
saying the tree is too old and too large to survive a transplant.</TE>
<TE>   The tree, dubbed Old Glory by environmentalists, was slated to be
cut down to expand Pico Canyon Road from two to four lanes. Quigley
thwarted the developer's plans by climbing up the tree seven weeks
ago in protest.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, environmentalists have rejected proposals to move the
oak, but are now backing plans such as Hoerner's to build a road
around it.</TE>

<LD>A once-prominent Los Angeles attorney was convicted Wednesday of
embezzling $380,000 from two young brothers whom she had offered help
in collecting on a life insurance policy on their mother, a police
officer who died of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Angela Fawn Wallace, 42, faces up to eight years and eight months
in prison for embezzlement, perjury and forgery.</LD>
<LD>   A USC Law School graduate, Wallace lived in Hancock Park and once
counted among her friends and clients such celebrities as basketball
legend Earvin "Magic" Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   She remains a suspect in the June 2001 fatal shootings of Howard
Byrdsong, 20, and his 18-year-old brother, Jontrae, Inglewood police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing for Wallace, who remains free on $150,000 bail, is set
for Jan. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's attorney, Milton Grimes, had argued during the four-week
trial that Wallace spent the money on the Byrdsong brothers, helping
them rent an apartment and fix up their mother's burned-out house so
it could be sold.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace received the $380,000 insurance check for Howard Byrdsong,
eldest son of Shiree Arrant, in August 2000, and opened a bank
account in his name using a forged power of attorney, Deputy Dist.
Atty. Ron Goudy said. She wrote a number of unauthorized checks on
the account, made them out to cash, herself, her law firm and others.</TE>
<TE>   After Howard Byrdsong contacted prosecutors in May 2001 about the
missing money, Wallace tried to strike a deal to return it if the
brothers would release her from legal liability, Goudy said.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers said no. A month later, they were shot dead in their
Inglewood home by a man dressed as a postal worker, authorities said.
No one has been charged in the murders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Wallace pleaded no contest in State Bar Court to seven
counts of professional misconduct, including writing 16 unauthorized
checks on the trust account of a Santa Monica retiree, Max Wolfe,
days after he died, and was suspended from law practice for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace also is awaiting trial on separate criminal charges that
she induced a friend to impersonate a business associate and lie
under oath at a State Bar disciplinary hearing in a failed attempt to
save her license to practice law in California.</TE>
<TE>   The jury found Wallace and a co-defendant, Timothy Mack, 47,
guilty on all six counts.</TE>

<HD>5 People Die in 24 Hours of Violence</HD>
<DH>Robber is killed during head shop holdup, but no one will
admit to doing it, police say.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Five people were killed in Los Angeles over a 24-hour period,
including a man who was shot during the attempted robbery of a North
Hollywood head shop and the owner and a customer of a downtown
hardware store, police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Claro Cortez, 44, of Los Angeles, the owner of Merces Hardware in
the 4500 block of South Main Street, died in an exchange of gunfire
with three robbery suspects at 1:20 p.m. Tuesday, Los Angeles Police
spokesman Jack Richter said.</LD>
<LD>   Customer Vincent Fredericks, 62, of Los Angeles died at a local
hospital after being critically wounded, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Police responding to the store after hearing gunshots saw a car
speeding away.</TE>
<TE>   They arrested three men on suspicion of murder: Jorge Martinez,
29; Alejandro Viveros, 26; and Jorge Sandoval, 29, all of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A replica firearm and two other guns believed to the murder
weapons were seized by police.</TE>
<TE>   In North Hollywood, a man died as he tried to rob a head shop in
the 12700 block of Sherman Way, according to Det. Mike Coffey.</TE>
<TE>   Brij Mehra, 27, of Santa Monica knocked on the shop's front door
about 12:30 a.m. after closing time and told the owner that he wanted
to buy a crack pipe, Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, Mehra pulled out a .45-caliber handgun and demanded
money from the cash register.</TE>
<TE>   "As the suspect was looking at items in a display case in the rear
of the business, the three people inside tried to make a run for it,"
Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe one of them grabbed a shotgun on the way out and shot
the suspect dead at the front of the business," Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the man's handgun was stolen from his
girlfriend during a domestic dispute two hours before the attempted
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   None of the witnesses would admit firing the shotgun, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident is under investigation and will be reviewed the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, police were called at 12:45 a.m. to the 1000 block of
Electric Avenue in Venice, where they discovered the body of a
30-year-old restaurant employee in his car.</TE>
<TE>   The dead man was identified as Michael Alan Treanor of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Division homicide investigators said they have no motive
or suspects in the case.</TE>
<TE>   About 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, police responded to a report of a body
dumped on a freeway offramp in Lake View Terrace.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified man, who appeared to have been stabbed, was found
at the Wheatland Avenue offramp of the eastbound Foothill Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they have no suspects or leads in that case.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS ECHO PARK</KH>
<HD>An Art Gallery With Car Culture Appeal</HD>
<DH>Motorists often brake to admire the installations at Sunset
Art Park, a donated space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is one gallery where an art exhibit's success is never gauged by
the foot traffic it generates.</LD>
<LD>   An exhibition's impact at the Sunset Art Park in Echo Park is
measured by automobile traffic it stops.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly eight years a series of provocative art shows at the
unusual display space carved into the side of a hill at 1478 Sunset
Blvd. has caused brake lights to flash and motorists' heads to turn.</LD>
<TE>   A military tank plows over a thick hedgerow of lush grass growing
in an installation called "Turf." A Santa Fe diesel locomotive roars
toward the street in a sculpture named "Super Chief." A battered
cabin cruiser stands precariously on its nose and seems to teeter
over passersby in a piece titled "Boat Drop."</TE>
<TE>   It's "drive-by art," in the words of Ernesto Montano, curator of
the outdoor exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists have to have a special skill to produce a piece that will
be noticed by people driving by in their cars. You don't have that
many people walking past this place. And the art has to be
appropriate: I invite artists to do something that takes into
consideration the architecture of Echo Park."</TE>
<TE>   The Art Park is surrounded on three sides by houses. A
wrought-iron fence separates it from busy Sunset Boulevard, where a
row of low-slung retail businesses stands across the street. A few
blocks away is the bustling center of Echo Park, with its food
markets, nail salons and clothing stores.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years Montano has staged 14 elaborate exhibitions at the
site. Passersby get out of their cars to study the current one: the
intricate but graceful "Derricks of the Rancho."</TE>
<TE>   Sculptor and ceramist Peter Shire has created five 20-foot metal
towers covered with circles and squares and topped by human-like
figures that seem to be balancing uneasily on chairs and ladders. The
installation represents Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about oil wells and construction cranes, about safety and
precariousness," said Shire -- born and raised in Echo Park and
considered by some to be the patriarch of the community's thriving
art colony. He is the first Echo Park artist to be shown in the Art
Park, Montano said.</TE>
<TE>   Shire said the outdoor gallery -- with its basement-like walls
that frame the sculpture installations -- is a piece of art itself.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a development that went amiss and the guy who owned it
figured out a really great way to deal with it," Shire said. "That's
the essence of creativity."</TE>
<TE>   Property owner Arthur Goldberg, a lawyer and the brother of state
Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), donated the site for
use as a gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg had planned in the early 1990s to build a new office on
the land for his Working People's Law Center. But that project soured
-- and the unfinished 35-by-60-foot construction site quickly became
a trash-strewn magnet for graffiti vandals.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, leaders of Jovenes Inc., a community-based service center
for at-risk youths, tried to convert the abandoned building site into
a tree-shaded "peace park." But vandals immediately stole some of the
trees and resumed spray-painting its concrete-block retaining walls.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Montano, Jovenes' art director, set out to turn it
into an art park instead. Initially, he tried to stage four
exhibitions a year there. When that proved impractical because of the
time needed to install and remove sculpture, two annual shows were
scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of local organizations and agencies, including the Los
Angeles County Arts Commission and the California Arts Council, help
finance the exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   A typical installation costs about $6,000. The artist receives
$2,000 of that, Montano said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no shortage of artists eager to be featured in the
outdoor gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "Every month we get proposals, but some are really out of hand.
One guy wanted to put a house in upside down and cut it open and fill
it with homeless people. He talked about his 'high concept,' but I
didn't see how we could make that work," Montano said.</TE>
<TE>   The most controversial installation so far has been this year's
"Turf" war sculpture, created by artists Kevin Schmitt and Don
Nguyen.</TE>
<TE>   "We had started in the conflict in Afghanistan. I asked the
artists to include Sept. 11. They came out with a tank made of a
fabric, kind of a toy tank over a cube of real grass that was
irrigated inside," Montano said.</TE>
<TE>   "We started getting mail saying, 'That's just what we need: an
army tank in Echo Park, one of the most progressive parts of the
city.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sterling Sheehy, a graduate student in animation and visual arts
at USC who lives next door to the Art Park, said he appreciates the
installations.</TE>
<TE>   "This creates culture," he said, gazing down at the top of Shire's
derrick-themed artwork. "Public venues and public works create a
community around here."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Greg Swanson agrees. His design office is in Echo Park,
and he often stops to view the art installations. He said his only
wish is that the outdoor gallery would be unfenced so visitors could
inspect the pieces up close.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful idea, taking a lot like this and bringing
something back to the community," Swanson said.</TE>
<TE>   Montano said he hopes to expand the open-air gallery concept
elsewhere in the city. He has secured a small display spot in Boyle
Heights and is looking for donated spaces in places like Hollywood
and the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Even a properly positioned flat wall could be used for
two-dimensional installations, he said. "If I can get two more places
to replicate this project, then we can have a larger budget and can
better stabilize our expenses."</TE>
<TE>   There's just one requirement, he said -- something they've learned
to appreciate in Echo Park:</TE>
<TE>   High-concept art deserves to be shown in a high-traffic area.</TE>

<HD>Consensus Is Emerging on Iraq's Failure, Powell Says</HD>
<DH>Secretary believes key Security Council members see
problems with weapons report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright and Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell asserted Wednesday that a
consensus is emerging at the U.N. Security Council that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein failed to come clean on his weapons of mass
destruction programs in the arms declaration Baghdad submitted this
month. "Our analysis of the Iraqi declaration to this point shows
problems with the declaration, gaps, omissions. And all of this is
troublesome," Powell told a news conference after meeting with
European Union officials.</LD>
<LD>   "[From] my conversations with the other permanent members of the
Security Council," he said, "I sense that they also see deficiencies"
-- although it appeared that the council was not yet ready to speak
with one voice.</LD>
<LD>   In its response to the Iraqi arms statement at the United Nations
today, the United States is expected to say that Iraq is guilty of "a
continuing pattern of material breaches" but that Washington will not
regard problems with the declaration as the trigger to launch a
military operation, according to a council diplomat.</LD>
<TE>   "Material breach" is the legal term invoked by the United States
or the United Nations to justify launching military action -- the
so-called trigger for war.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration appears to be wary that declaring Iraq in
full violation now might weaken its position down the road when, it
hopes, evidence will be produced to prove that Baghdad is hiding its
deadliest arms in violation of several U.N. resolutions. Then
Washington would be more assured of international support for going
to war.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will make its presentation when the council meets to hear
chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and International Atomic
Energy Agency chief Mohammed Baradei give their assessments of the
Iraqi declaration.</TE>
<TE>   Both are expected to use more careful language than the United
States in describing the lingering and still unanswered questions
since the previous inspection team completed a comprehensive report
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. received strong support Wednesday from Britain, which
accused Hussein of lying.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Britain said
Baghdad's claim not to have nuclear, chemical or biological weapons
or ballistic missiles "will fool nobody."</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear, even on a preliminary assessment, that it is not the
full and complete declaration requested," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Straw particularly noted that Iraq offered no accounting for
"large quantities of nerve agent, chemical precursors and munitions"
it is known to have.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam persists in this obvious falsehood," he added, "it will
become clear that he has rejected the pathway to peace laid down in
Resolution 1441," which authorizes the resumption of weapons
inspections and the disarmament of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, a U.N. envoy said the biggest surprise in the almost
12,000-page declaration was that Baghdad made no effort to account
for materiel it either is widely known to have or has even admitted
acquiring.</TE>
<TE>   "Any straight-thinking member of the council can see what was
outstanding in the 1999 inspectors' report is still outstanding," the
diplomat said. "There are no excuses or pretenses in the declaration
to account for the gaps. That's what surprises us -- that there's
never even any effort to come up with an explanation."</TE>
<TE>   In somewhat tepid terms and less publicly, France has also
acknowledged that there are "gray areas and gaps" in the declaration,
which French arms experts found "inconclusive," according to its U.N.
mission.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States still has some work to do in convincing
Russia and China, the other two of the five permanent council
members, as well as some of the 10 nations with rotating seats,
according to U.N. envoys. Several are reserving judgment until after
hearing Blix and Baradei.</TE>
<TE>   "China's position is that we should allow the two international
organizations to inspect first because they are on site in Iraq and
can see with their own eyes what is there. It is up to them to make
the judgment. Then the Security Council will make the decision on
whether Iraq is in material breach," said Meng Xianying, China's U.N.
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The council is feeling some heat even before Blix makes his
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Syria's angry envoy returned the heavily edited copy of Iraq's
declaration Wednesday and demanded the full text provided to the five
permanent council members. "This is an unacceptable discrimination,"
Fayssal Mekdad said.</TE>
<TE>   "Syria as a member of the council has the right to receive the
report in full. Either we take a full copy or we don't take
anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said Wednesday that Washington was planning to allow the
process to play out through the U.N. weapons inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not encouraged that they have gotten the message or will
cooperate, based on what we have seen so far in the declaration, but
we will stay within the U.N. process," Powell told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. national security team, which mapped out strategy with
President Bush at the White House on Wednesday morning, made it clear
that the regime in Baghdad was endangering its future.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said, "I think it is pretty
clear from the people who have had a chance to take a look at the
documents that they are still trying to find things in them that they
expected to be there that weren't there.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of weapons of mass destruction, one has to believe they
are much stronger" than during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when U.S.
troops forced Hussein to withdraw his army from Kuwait, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "So it is a dangerous business and he is engaged in a dangerous
game," Rumsfeld said on CNN's "Larry King Live."</TE>
<TE>   Although there is a growing sense of momentum behind military
action in Washington, Rumsfeld said the United States will now "take
some time" to talk with allies about the Iraqi report and to discuss
next steps.</TE>
<TE>   But the defense chief also held out another solution to the issue
of Hussein and his arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "The other option they have is to leave the country. I mean,
Saddam Hussein and his family could pick up," he said. "I mean, if he
doesn't care to give us his weapons of mass destruction, then he's
got the choice of leaving."</TE>

<DH>Swaziland is being pushed to the brink -- by AIDS, drought
and a king whose libido exemplifies the woes of this patriarchal
society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MBABANE, Swaziland</DL>
<LD>It's good to be king.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly half the people in this land of 1.1 million live in
thatched huts without electricity or running water, and King Mswati
III is in the market for a $50-million private jet.</LD>
<LD>   Polygamous relationships are among the main drivers of Swaziland's
33% HIV infection rate, but Mswati is still a monarch on the make. In
the furtherance of the royal libido, the 34-year-old king's minions
recently abducted an 18-year-old student from her schoolyard. She
soon will become the king's 10th wife. As his people battle drought,
disease and local customs that put a chokehold on the lives of women,
Mswati has been swapping ideas with pop star Michael Jackson for an
Africa-themed amusement park in Mbabane, the administrative capital.</LD>
<TE>   Parliament told him that he couldn't buy the plane, but the king
still wants wings, and only he controls the royal purse.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a saying here," said Thulani Rudolf Maseko of the Lawyers
for Human Rights in Mbabane. " 'The king is a mouth that does not
lie.' This means: Whatever the king says, even when he lies, is the
truth. Whatever the king does, even if it's wrong and unjust, is
lawful."</TE>
<TE>   Now many seem to be saying: Enough is enough. International aid
organizations are threatening to withdraw badly needed resources, and
foreign governments say they will cut off diplomatic ties with this
southern African nation if the monarchy doesn't show more respect for
the rule of law. Business groups here say the king's shenanigans are
scaring off foreign investment. Disgusted at his lack of regard for
their rulings, the nation's appellate court justices recently
resigned en masse.</TE>
<TE>   And if all that weren't bad enough, labor unions are planning a
two-day national strike beginning today to challenge the king. The
action is expected to bring Swaziland to a standstill.</TE>
<TE>   Portraits of the nation's undisputed alpha male -- goateed, decked
in feathers, animal skins and other furry regalia -- stare from
travel brochures and hotel lobby walls across the land. Swaziland's
stubborn sultan seems a ready symbol for a patriarchal society
drowning in its own testosterone.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not just about the king or one abducted girl or her
mother," Doo Mary-Joyce Aphane, national coordinator of Swaziland's
Women and Law in Southern Africa think tank, said of the king's
recent marital conquest. "It's about the rights of all mothers and
the safety of girls in our society."</TE>
<TE>   Human rights lawyers and unionists representing virtually all
trades in Swaziland have sought an audience with Mswati to discuss
the nation's woes in advance of the strike. But when you're the ruler
of Swaziland, there are other things to attend to than the ruination
of the kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   Observances for the annual Incwala -- or "first fruit eating" in
the Siswati language -- have begun and, as dictated by custom, the
king will be in seclusion until the end of the planting season in
mid-January, government officials say. During this period, he cannot
fulfill any government functions -- except, of course, for the moment
it took to decree that the union protest was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Masuku, president of the People's United Democratic
Movement, a banned political party, said the protest during the
Incwala will be a "challenge to the monarchy itself." After spending
10 months in detention on sedition charges, Masuku was acquitted and
released in August. He has just returned from a European speaking
tour, during which he urged governments to use divestiture and other
means to force the king to share power.</TE>
<TE>   As pressure grows to limit the king's authority and to merge the
nation's vast body of oral laws with its not-so-vast written laws,
Mswati has reacted by attempting to squelch debate. He has ignored
Parliament, whose members are elected by the people but endorsed by
the king. Mswati also has total say over who is in his Cabinet, and
they all abide by his bidding. He has enforced a longtime ban on
political parties, jailed his critics and co-opted a movement to
draft a new national legal structure by stacking the constitutional
commission with a number of his 200 princely brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Swaziland, a mountainous, landlocked nation in the northeastern
corner of South Africa, was ruled by the Voortrekkers -- Dutch
pioneers -- and then by the British until 1968, when a constitutional
monarchy was set up. Five years later, King Sobhuza II's herald
called a public meeting in the palace cattle corral, where he read
the monarch's repeal of the constitution. Sobhuza dissolved all
parties, seized all government lands and gave himself authority to
appoint or dismiss executive members of government.</TE>
<TE>   Upon Sobhuza's death in 1982, his son Mswati cut short his
schooling in England and took the throne four years later, at 18.</TE>
<TE>   "The British, ... the Spaniards, the Danes, in Lesotho -- they all
have monarchies that don't interfere with the day-to-day running of
the government," said labor leader Jan Sithole. "Their kings don't
rule, they only reign. In Swaziland, our king reigns and rules."</TE>
<TE>   If Swaziland's constitutional problem were its only challenge,
this would be a troubled land indeed. But the kingdom, which relies
on maize for sustenance and sugarcane for trade, has more problems to
worry about: It has been afflicted by drought for three straight
years.</TE>
<TE>   The grasslands of the Lowveld plains have given way to dusty
patches of red earth. Crops are stunted this planting season: Maize
stands only ankle-high when it should skirt the waist. Half the
country's farmers saw no yield this year, and production is down 60%.
The World Food Program estimates that 250,000 people in Swaziland
don't have enough to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning on his walking stick, Simon Dingizwe Dlamini lined up last
week for a sack of cornmeal. Like most in the Lowveld area, Dingizwe
Dlamini's family relies on its harvest for sustenance. But last year,
everything he sowed died in the dirt. And this season, the ground is
so brittle and unyielding that he didn't waste his time planting.</TE>
<TE>   What's worse, Dingizwe Dlamini has more mouths to feed this year.
AIDS recently killed his daughter, leaving him to care for her three
children. He said he decided to sacrifice the education of his 10
other children so that he can afford semester fees for his
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Waves of HIV carriers -- women mostly, mothers often -- are
beginning to die of AIDS. The United Nations estimates that one-third
of Swazi children will be orphaned by 2005, and many of them won't
have kindly grandparents to care for them.</TE>
<TE>   With AIDS wreaking such havoc, Thobile Dlamini, who runs a women's
counseling and advocacy center in the city of Manzini, said the
king's abduction of the 18-year-old was worse than boorish, it was
irresponsible. "The king is undermining all of our efforts," she
said. "We are really past an age where a man can have so many wives."</TE>
<TE>   All too often, said Dlamini, who is not related to Simon Dingizwe
Dlamini, women are casualties of patriarchal Swazi traditions. A U.N.
report released this year found that Swaziland's annual "reed dance"
that once was a celebration of female chastity has now become a meat
market for men and a conduit for the AIDS epidemic. In fact, it was
there that Mswati first laid eyes on his most recent bride.</TE>
<TE>   The report also found that women's low status in Swaziland often
leaves them impoverished and vulnerable to exploitation "as they are
forced to depend on men" and that polygamous marriages like the
king's contribute to the spread of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, as does the Swazi practice of widow inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   "The widow might be HIV-positive as her husband might have died of
an AIDS-related illness," according to the report. "This would mean
that the brother inheriting the widow could be infected and in turn
could infect his [other] wives."</TE>
<TE>   Even the Siswati language conspires against her sex, Dlamini said.</TE>
<TE>   "The ... word we use for wife or woman literally means: 'One who
dies without speaking of what she endures.' Women are supposed to be
silent when they are abused," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Swaziland has only recently drafted laws against sexual offenses
and has barely begun prosecuting rape cases. Women's rights to own
land, enter into contractual agreements and, generally, function
independently of their fathers and husbands are sharply limited.</TE>
<TE>   So when men die in Swaziland, their wives often are left without
land, money or even skills to earn a living.</TE>
<TE>   By Swazi standards, the late Mshiselwa Ndzinisa was something of a
mogul. An advisor to several local chiefs, Ndzinisa owned three
buses, many cattle and vast lands planted with maize and sugarcane.
It takes an hour of driving up steep dirt roads to find his home on a
mountain peak.</TE>
<TE>   Ndzinisa's 22 widows still live in his compound. There used to be
26, but in the last year, four have died. One had cancer, the wives
say. The other three died of mysterious illnesses that caused
lesions. Several other widows are ailing.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of them, including several of the most senior, agreed to
speak with a visitor about their lives, but they first led him away
from the main house where Ndzinisa's eldest son lives.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not living a normal life. We have to struggle to have
something to eat," said Pauline Ndzinisa, 50. "No one is taking care
of us since our husband died."</TE>
<TE>   The late patriarch's brother and eldest son inherited all of the
property, "and they are keeping all the wealth to themselves," said
Theresa Ndzinisa, also 50.</TE>
<TE>   The women said they regret having entered into such a communal
matrimony. For the oldest, it was a bit unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   "I never knew he wanted so many women," Theresa said. "He would
take a wife, and I would think: OK, that's the last one. And then he
would take another. And I would think: That's the last one. And then
he'd take another and another."</TE>
<TE>   The widows have been allowed to stay in their respective homes,
but they have no seed or tools to plow. Nor are they allowed to sell
any of the cattle grazing the mountainside. They and their 78
children are hungry.</TE>
<TE>   As for the potentate, most agree that Mswati will continue to
stack his harem. Some say he's looking for a wife who will give him a
firstborn male heir. Others say he's just a chip off the old block --
his father, who died at 83, had about 100 wives.</TE>

<HD>Southland Home Prices Soar, Defying Sluggish Economy</HD>
<DH>The 21% rise, the biggest since 1989, is fueled by low
mortgage rates and a housing shortage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unexpected burst of sales boosted Southern California home prices
by 21% in November, the biggest year-over-year increase since the
peak of the last housing boom in 1989, according to new figures
released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The jump in the overall median price of new and existing houses
and condominiums sold, to a record $288,000, showed that Southern
California's housing market is still on a roll despite the gloomy
economy and the possibility of a war. Home prices hit new highs in
the region's most-populous counties -- from San Diego to Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Total sales rose more than 12% to 25,601, according to DataQuick
Information Systems, which compiles the sales information from
property records.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts and brokers said that although low mortgage rates
continue to turn renters into owners, the market is getting a
powerful boost from homeowners who are trading up and those taking
money out of the sagging stock market and putting it into real
estate.</TE>
<TE>   Typical are people such as Nestor Lopez, 34, who recently paid
$260,000 for a three-bedroom house in Reseda. Lopez, an accountant
with the Braille Institute in Los Angeles, said he wanted a home with
a yard for his 2-year-old son. Lopez sold some stock -- at a loss --
to get a down payment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see housing falling like stocks did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Economists and housing experts increasingly have raised concerns
about a so-called housing bubble in many places, including Southern
California, where home prices generally have been rising rapidly for
many months. And analysts this year have been expecting the
Southland's real estate market to at least taper off, given the
anemic job market and weak growth in personal incomes.</TE>
<TE>   But the last few months have made a lie of conventional economic
thinking. John Husing, an economist in the Inland Empire, says it is
all about a supply shortage. "We are just not building enough new
housing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the median price of houses and condominiums sold in
Los Angeles County rose 22% from a year earlier, to $281,000,
according to DataQuick. The median price in Orange County surged by
almost 19% to $383,000.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Riverside County, long considered a haven for affordable
housing, the median home price soared almost 19% to $228,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible," said Scott Gibson, head of Coldwell Banker's
Los Angeles division. "We had a great November and we are trending
ahead of last year" for December.</TE>
<TE>   Most real estate experts agree that record low mortgage rates
continue to allow buyers to remain in the market despite prices that
are spiraling upward.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the latest average 30-year fixed mortgage rate of about
6%, the typical home buyer in Los Angeles County last month who put
20% down was looking at a mortgage payment of $1,293. In May 1989 --
the last time home prices surged by about the same percentage -- the
typical buyer was faced with a monthly payment of $1,453, DataQuick
said.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist at the California Assn. of
Realtors, said there are signs that the housing market is flagging in
other parts of the country, including Northern California. But she
said Southern California's economy is still growing, in sharp
contrast with the early 1990s when the region lost nearly 400,000
jobs, helping to trigger a housing bust.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see the 'bubble' that people are talking about down
here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Appleton-Young's association projects that the median price of
single-family homes statewide will rise 10% in 2003, compared with
18% this year.</TE>
<TE>   But among the economists who remain concerned about an overheated
housing market is Esmael Adibi of Chapman University, who thinks home
prices should be rising at only a fraction of the current pace, given
the other economic fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to have a problem sooner or later," he said. "If
income and job growth don't catch up ... ultimately these home prices
have to go through an adjustment."</TE>
<TE>   Even if home prices are rising at what many consider unrealistic
rates, Lisa Grant and her husband, George Vail, were not deterred
from selling their house in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles and
investing their sizable profit in a $340,000 duplex in nearby Echo
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate "is your best bet as an investment," said Grant, 29,
an actress. "We feel pretty confident."</TE>
<TE>   Many people say they know real estate prices may be out of line,
said Laura Tarbox, a financial planner in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "They understand that the market may be high, but they say that
they're comfortable with it," she added. "And it's hard to argue with
that because real estate has done so well here."</TE>

<HD>Crunch Time for Governor</HD>
<DH>Davis gears up for a difficult year by acknowledging the
severity of the state's crisis and naming a respected point man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For all the number-crunching that went into the state's new projected
budget shortfall, the figure Gov. Gray Davis announced Wednesday is a
political calculation as well.</LD>
<LD>   The governor has to lead the state out of its budget crisis, and
he needs the Legislature's help to do it.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than downplaying the vastness of the budget gap, Davis
announced three weeks before he was required to do so that he now
expects the hole to be $34.8 billion.</LD>
<TE>   And after a first term marked by cool relations with the
Legislature, the governor appointed a legislative insider, former
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace, as his new finance
director and chief budget liaison with lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Both moves are part of a broader political strategy for a governor
who won reelection last month by a surprisingly narrow margin against
a political novice, Republican Bill Simon Jr., who throughout the
campaign accused Davis of failing to confront problems directly.</TE>
<TE>   "They're staring [the problem] in the face," said Lenny Goldberg,
who lobbies on budget and tax matters for an array of clients,
including organized labor. "There's no more papering it over. The
time is here to truly confront it."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was under no obligation to release the deficit estimate
Wednesday. He could have waited until Jan. 10, when he unveils his
proposed spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1. But he
did so to dramatize a problem -- and his role in addressing it --
that could dominate his second term. He already has proposed $10.2
billion in budget cuts and has called a special session of the
Legislature to deal with the state's finances.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Davis acknowledged in his most direct language so
far that tax hikes will be part of the budget he offers Jan. 10. That
proposal, he said, "will have further reductions and, in all
likelihood, it will have some revenue increases."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers and many lobbyists already have proposed a
variety of tax proposals, ranging from new fees on alcohol to taxes
on services such as lobbying, and higher state income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Davis announced that the deficit had grown to $34.8
billion, some skeptics were suggesting that he had inflated the size
of the problem, in part to soften opposition to tax hikes that almost
certainly are coming.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of what they're trying to do is build a case for tax
increases," said Assemblyman Ray Haynes (R-Murrieta), who said he
believes the true deficit is more like $25 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' defenders dispute that contention, saying he is confronting
the budget hole as quickly as possible so he won't face a continuing
crisis for the rest of his tenure as governor.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want to live with this for the next four years," said
Susan Kennedy, Davis' Cabinet secretary and one of his top aides on
budget matters. "If he has to walk through fire, he wants to do it
once."</TE>
<TE>   While the budget situation grew bleaker, legislators welcomed
Davis' decision to hire Peace as his finance director.</TE>
<TE>   Peace replaces Timothy Gage, who joined the administration in 1999
after being one of the Legislature's top budget analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Peace brings knowledge of budget matters and an ability to
communicate with legislators. He's also opinionated. Though he's been
relatively close to Davis, he is likely to challenge the governor and
argue for his position.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers have been among the harshest critics
of Davis, often chastising him for failing to exert leadership on an
array of matters, including the budget and the energy crisis in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda), for one, surveyed the $10.2 billion
in cuts that Davis rather hastily proposed earlier this year, and
concluded that the governor was asking legislators "to do the heavy
lifting."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Perata said that by selecting Peace, Davis was
"extending an olive branch" to the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Peace will be especially valuable if, as expected, Cabinet
Secretary Kennedy leaves the administration. Kennedy has good
relations with several lawmakers, among them Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton (D-San Francisco), who has often clashed with Davis but
was pleased by the choice of Peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows him, everybody likes him, everybody respects
him," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Haynes, among the most conservative legislators,
criticized Peace.</TE>
<TE>   "He was chairman of the Budget Committee when we went from a
$12-billion surplus to a $24-billion deficit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Haynes extolled Peace for his intelligence and called him a
friend.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of the most knowledgeable people about the budget.
There's no question about that."</TE>

<HD>Davis Says Tax Hikes Likely as Shortfall Soars</HD>
<DH>The governor raises the budget gap estimate to $34.8
billion. He names former legislator Steve Peace to serve as his new
finance director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis strongly suggested Wednesday that he will propose tax
increases to address the state's budget shortfall, which he said has
soared to $34.8 billion -- nearly $14 billion more than was estimated
four weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Davis also announced that he is replacing his finance director
with Steve Peace, a former legislator who has strong support in the
state Senate and Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   The shakeup comes in the face of growing resistance by Democratic
legislators and interest groups to $10.2 billion in spending cuts and
other savings that the governor proposed earlier this month.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to propose a balanced approach," said Davis, who must
submit his 2003-04 budget to the Legislature by Jan. 10. "It will
have further reductions and in all likelihood it will have some
revenue increases."</TE>
<TE>   The latest budget shortfall figure is sharply higher than the
$21-billion deficit projected in mid-November by nonpartisan
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill. The analyst and many other
experts said that even a $21-billion hole would require a mix of
spending cuts and tax increases to repair.</TE>
<TE>   The sharp increase in the shortfall projections over the last
month led Republican leaders in Sacramento to accuse the governor of
having hidden the extent of the state's budget problems last year, as
he was seeking reelection. Some of those same adversaries now accuse
Davis of raising the deficit predictions in order to build his case
for tax hikes next year.</TE>
<TE>   "These numbers go beyond the most dire predictions and projections
we were looking at," said Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to me that the books were cooked last year [to
downplay the budget problem] and the books are cooked this year [to
exaggerate the problem]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis suggested otherwise, saying Hill's $21-billion projection
was based on incomplete information on state tax receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he released the latest shortfall figure Wednesday --
more than three weeks earlier than usual -- "to let people know the
context in which those $10.2-billion worth of reductions should be
viewed."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the rapidly changing estimates being offered by various
players in the budget debate, Davis said state leaders need to agree
on the extent of the fiscal problem confronting California.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it does the Legislature a disservice if some people feel
Finance's assessment is accurate but others think the legislative
analyst is the more accurate one," Davis said. "We need to get them
on the same page, or at a minimum, all of the [legislative leaders
and the governor] need to agree what set of numbers we're going to
work with."</TE>
<TE>   The gap between state spending and tax collections has already
unleashed a fierce debate over possible solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers are opposed to deep cuts in programs for
needy Californians and support tax increases as a partial solution.
Republicans say spending cuts alone should solve the problem -- a
notion that Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) rejected yet
again on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say the problem is so large that it can be solved
only with a two-year budget that would involve rolling over debt. But
Davis said his aim was to find a single-year solution.</TE>
<TE>   "As governor of this state, I want to err on the side of being
conservative, getting the problem solved," he said. "If in fact the
economy recovers sooner than we think, it's always easier to go back
and restore things we had to cut."</TE>
<TE>   Davis went to great lengths Wednesday to make the case that the
projected $34.8-billion deficit results from the national economic
downturn and the corresponding decline in state tax collections. Of
the shortfall projected over the next 18 months, half, or $17.7
billion, is the result of declining state tax revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Of the other half, $4.5 billion is the result of increased state
spending, and $12.6 billion comes from a combination of reasons,
including decisions to borrow against the future. For example, the
decision to cash out California's share of the national tobacco tax
settlement and use that money to help balance last year's budget will
deprive the state of $4.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Those decisions added to a deficit caused in part by what Davis
called "structural" problems with the state's spending. The governor
said Wednesday that even if spending remained static next year and
tax revenue flowed as expected, the budget would be more than $12
billion in the red.</TE>
<TE>   The projected increase in state spending, meanwhile, is the result
of budget assumptions earlier this year that proved to be incorrect.
In particular, Davis, in the 2002-03 budget that the Legislature
approved last summer, anticipated receiving money from the federal
government that has not materialized, as some had warned. One result
is that the state is being forced to spend an additional $1.2 billion
on programs it had hoped Washington would pay for.</TE>
<TE>   The spiraling budget crisis requires "quick, urgent action," Davis
said, noting the steps he has taken since winning reelection Nov. 5.
His recommendations have included $10.2 billion in cuts and other
savings from the current budget and the 2003-04 budget.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans applauded the cuts and say they would like to see even
more. But Democratic legislators and interest groups have criticized
the Davis proposals at a series of public hearings around the state
this week.</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature convened in a special session Dec. 9 to
discuss the governor's proposals and other possible solutions to the
budget crisis. But Democrats -- led by Burton -- are reluctant to
discuss budget cuts without seeing Davis' full 2003-04 spending plan,
including proposed tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Davis made several tax proposals earlier this year as part of his
2002-03 budget. The Legislature "by and large didn't accept" those
tax increases, and Davis said Wednesday that any new revenue
recommendations would not necessarily include the same proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Groups facing deep budget cuts applauded Davis for signaling his
support for tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   The soaring shortfall "magnifies the desperate need for a balanced
approach to addressing the shortfall -- both revenue and reductions,"
said Kevin Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of
School Business Officials, which represents California school
districts on budget and finance matters. "There's absolutely no way
you can grapple with a deficit of this magnitude without talking
about some pretty serious tax hikes. Every tax idea has to be on the
table."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon criticized Republican lawmakers for refusing to consider
tax increases as part of the budget solution.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republicans point to the governor and Democrats and say they
contributed to the problem by increasing spending when times were
good," he said. "Republicans, too, contributed to the problem by
reducing revenue into the state when times were good."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, however, countered that, with the state facing
difficult economic times, a tax increase now will only delay
California's recovery and prolong the budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In his package of cuts and savings earlier this month, Davis
proposed cutting spending for public schools by $3.1 billion this
year and in the 2003-04 budget year that begins July 1. He also
recommended reductions of $2 billion in health and social services,
$1.9 billion in government operations and $1.7 billion in
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the $17.7-billion revenue shortfall Davis announced
Wednesday is accounted for by a significant drop in projected
collections of personal income taxes. Income tax collections for the
current fiscal year will be $4.7 billion below the previous estimate,
Davis said, and will fall $6.8 billion short of earlier estimates in
the fiscal year that begins July 1.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, sales tax collections over the next 18 months will be
off by $2 billion, and corporate income taxes by $2.2 billion, the
governor said. Most of the rest of the revenue loss is from declines
in other taxes and fees.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a long and bitter legislative battle over the budget, Davis
could be aided in his efforts to mend strained relations with the
Legislature by the appointment of Peace, a former state senator, as
his new finance director.</TE>
<TE>   Peace will replace Timothy Gage, a Capitol veteran with a
background in finance but lacking in political stature.</TE>
<TE>   Burton was joined by several Republicans in praising Peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows him. They know he knows his stuff. He's
imaginative. I think it's a great thing for the state," Burton said.</TE>

<HD>Hundreds Are Detained After Visits to INS</HD>
<DH>Thousands protest arrests of Mideast boys and men who
complied with order to register.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey, Martha Groves and Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of men and boys from Middle Eastern countries were arrested
by federal immigration officials in Southern California this week
when they complied with orders to appear at INS offices for a special
registration program.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests drew thousands of people to demonstrate Wednesday in
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesmen refused Wednesday
to say how many people the agency had detained, what the specific
charges were or how many were still being held. But officials
speaking anonymously said they would not dispute estimates by lawyers
for detainees that the number across Southern California was 500 to
700. In Los Angeles, up to one-fourth of those who showed up to
register were jailed, lawyers said.</LD>
<TE>   The number of people arrested in this region appears to have been
considerably larger than elsewhere in the country, perhaps because of
the size of the Southland's Iranian population. Monday's registration
deadline applied to males 16 and older from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan
and Syria. Men from 13 other nations, mostly in the Mideast and North
Africa, are required to register next month.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those arrested, according to their lawyers, had already
applied for green cards and, in some instances, had interviews
scheduled in the near future. Although they had overstayed their
visas, attorneys argue, their clients had already taken steps to
remedy the situation and were following the regulations closely.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the people who've voluntarily gone" to the INS, said
Mike S. Manesh of the Iranian American Lawyers Assn. "If they had
anything to do with terrorism, they wouldn't have gone."</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials acknowledged Wednesday that many of those
taken into custody this week have status-adjustment applications
pending that have not yet been acted on.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of people who are coming forward to register
are currently in legal immigration status," said local INS
spokeswoman Virginia Kice. "The people we have taken into custody ...
are people whose non-immigrant visas have expired."</TE>
<TE>   The large number of Iranians among the detainees has angered many
in the area's Iranian communities, who organized a demonstration
Wednesday at the federal building in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   At the rally, which police officials estimated drew about 3,000
protesters at its peak, signs bore such sentiments as "What Next?
Concentration Camps?" and "Detain Terrorists Not Innocent
Immigrants."</TE>
<TE>   The arrests have generated widespread publicity, mostly
unfavorable, in the Middle East, said Khaled Dawoud, a correspondent
for Al Ahram, one of Egypt's largest dailies. He questioned State
Department official Charlotte Beers about the detentions Wednesday
after a presentation she made at the National Press Club in
Washington. Egyptians are not included in the registration
requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Beers, undersecretary of State for public diplomacy and public
affairs, was presenting examples of a U.S. outreach campaign for the
Middle East, which includes images of Muslims leading happy lives
here. Dawoud asked how that image squared with the "humiliating"
arrests in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is any question that the change in visa
policy is going to be seen by some as difficult and, indeed -- what
was the word you used? -- humiliating," Beers said. But, she added,
President Bush has said repeatedly that he considers "his No. 1 ...
job to be the protection of the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives and lawyers of those arrested locally challenge that
rationale for the latest round of detentions.</TE>
<TE>   One attorney, who said he saw a 16-year-old pulled from the arms
of his crying mother, called it madness to believe that the
registration requirements would catch terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "His mother is 6 1/2 months pregnant. They told the mother he is
never going to come home -- she is losing her mind," said attorney
Soheila Jonoubi, who spent Wednesday amid the chaos of the downtown
INS office attempting to determine the status of her clients.</TE>
<TE>   Jonoubi said that the mother has permanent residence status and
that her husband, the boy's stepfather, is a U.S. citizen. The
teenager came to the country in July on a student visa and was on
track to gain permanent residence, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Many objected to the treatment of those who showed up for the
registration. INS ads on local Persian radio stations and in other
ethnic media led many to expect a routine procedure. Instead, the
registration quickly became the subject of fear as word spread that
large numbers of men were being arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers reported crowded cells with some clients forced to rest
standing up, some shackled and moved to other locations in the night,
frigid conditions in jail cells -- all for men with no known criminal
histories.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Sedaghat, a Sherman Oaks attorney, said he and his partner,
Michelle Taheripour, represent more than 40 people who voluntarily
went to register and were detained.</TE>
<TE>   Some, he said, were hosed down with cold water before finding
places to sleep on the concrete floors of cells.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas Guttentag, who heads the West Coast office of the American
Civil Liberties Union's immigrant rights project, fears the wave of
arrests is "a prelude to much more widespread arrests and
deportations."</TE>
<TE>   "The secrecy gives rise to obvious concerns about what the INS is
doing and whether people's rights are being respected and whether the
problems that arose in the aftermath of 9/11 are being repeated now,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many at Wednesday's protest said they took the day off work to
join the rally, because they were shocked by the treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to this country over 40 years ago and got drafted in the
Army, and I thought if I die it's for a good cause, defending
freedom, democracy and the Constitution," said George Hassan, 65,
from the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Oppressed people come here because of that democracy, that
freedom, that Constitution. Now our president has apparently allowed
the INS vigilantes to step outside the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern
California, called the detentions doubly disturbing because "a lot of
the Iranians are Jews who fled Iran because of persecution, and now
they are undergoing similar persecution here.... This is just
terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Ban Al-Wardi, who saw 14 of her 20 clients arrested when
she went with them to the registration, said that although everyone
understands the need to protect the nation against terrorist attacks,
the government's recent action went too far.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our fundamental civil rights have been violated by these
actions," she said. "I don't know how far this is going to go before
people start speaking up. This is a very dangerous precedent we are
setting. What's to stop Americans from being treated like this when
they travel overseas?"</TE>

<DL>NIIGATA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Five Japanese kidnapped by North Korea in the late 1970s broke their
silence today, saying they want to stay in their homeland
permanently. They asked Tokyo to continue talks with the communist
regime to bring their families to Japan.</LD>
<LD>   The abductees' announcement marked the first time they have
expressed a desire to resettle in Japan since returning in October
for what was supposed to be a two-week visit.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea says that the five are being kept in Japan against
their will and has refused Tokyo's request to send over their seven
children.</LD>
<TE>   Abductee Yasushi Chimura said the five made their decision after
private talks Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have confirmed with each other that we want to remain in
Japan," he said.</TE>

<HD>4 Accused of Plotting U.S. Embassy Attack Are Acquitted</HD>
<DH>Dutch decision in the first European trial of post-Sept. 11
arrestees is a setback for police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>A Dutch court on Wednesday acquitted four men charged with plotting
to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris and other American targets, handing
law enforcement a big setback in the first European trial of
suspected terrorists arrested after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In its ruling, a three-judge panel in Rotterdam threw out most of
the evidence because it was gathered by Dutch intelligence agents who
conducted searches without warrants.</LD>
<LD>   Even if the evidence had been admitted, said Judge S. Van Dooren,
a court spokesman, it did not prove that the defendants were a
support cell for a North African network in the Netherlands, Belgium
and France. The network allegedly planned to attack the Paris embassy
and a U.S. military base in Belgium.</LD>
<TE>   The verdict proved that Dutch authorities rushed into a weak
prosecution in the tense days after Sept. 11, said Inge Saey, a
lawyer for Jerome Courtailler, a French convert to Islam accused of
leading the purported cell.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no evidence that my client was preparing an attack or
belonged to a criminal organization," Saey said in a telephone
interview. "My client was never in Afghanistan. My client doesn't
speak Arabic. He is not an extremist or a fanatic."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they would appeal. The outcome troubled European
and U.S. officials, who said considerable evidence connects the
Rotterdam group to accused Al Qaeda figures facing trial elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Courtailler, 28, was an admitted associate of Nizar Trabelsi, a
Tunisian imprisoned in Belgium who has said he intended to commit a
suicide bombing against a U.S. military base in Klein Brogel,
Belgium. Police said they found bomb-making formulas and an Uzi
machine pistol at Trabelsi's apartment in Brussels and bomb-making
chemicals in the basement of a restaurant owned by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   The trial demonstrated the difficulties of prosecuting terrorism
cases in Europe's patchwork of diverse judicial systems. Unlike
Spain, the Netherlands does not have tough laws for prosecuting
alleged terrorists if they are not linked to a specific act. Unlike
France's domestic intelligence agency, the Dutch Internal Security
Service does not have the ability to simultaneously conduct
counterespionage and investigate criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Islamic extremists have refined the craft of
compartmentalizing activities and spreading out cells to use Europe's
borders as shields. That aggravates a perennial dilemma in terrorism
cases: whether to make arrests or wait and watch. Months of
surveillance had convinced French, Belgian and Dutch investigators
that Trabelsi and his group were dangerous, so they were rounded up
Sept. 13, 2001, during a Europe-wide blitz of suspected Islamic
extremists.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a classic example of the issue of prevention versus
prosecution," said a U.S. official familiar with the case. "On Sept.
13, no one knew what else was about to hit. There was fear of a
second wave of attacks in Europe." Courtailler and his brother,
David, were well known to police across Europe, who had shadowed them
for years. The Courtaillers' path to Islam began in an Alpine village
in southeastern France, where the brothers grew up playing soccer and
working in the family butcher shop.</TE>
<TE>   The Courtaillers went to Britain, where they embraced Islam and
frequented radical mosques that are hubs for the Al Qaeda network in
Europe. They met figures such as Jamal Beghal, an Algerian awaiting
trial in France as the accused boss of the North African network.</TE>
<TE>   After Beghal was arrested in the United Arab Emirates in July
2001, authorities say, he confessed to plotting to bomb the Paris
embassy on the orders of top Al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan. Beghal
later said he made the admissions under duress.</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Courtailler also spent time in Spain in July 2001 with
North Africans who are now facing terrorism charges there, according
to Spanish court documents. French authorities say Jerome and his
brother, who has admitted that he trained at an Al Qaeda camp in
Afghanistan, associated in London with Frenchman Zacarias Moussaoui,
the accused "20th hijacker" charged in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Saey said Wednesday that there was no evidence at trial indicating
that her client knew Moussaoui. The judges ordered Courtailler's
release along with that of defendants Abdelghani Rabia and Amine
Mezbar, both Algerians, and Saaid Ibrahim, a Dutch citizen of
Ethiopian descent. Courtailler and the Algerians were being held on
immigration charges Wednesday, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Britain has arrested seven suspects under its Terrorism
Act. No details were given, but the arrests came as senior British
officials warned of a "high probability" of a terrorist attack.</TE>

<HD>Argentina on Edge as It Awaits Massive Protest</HD>
<DH>Thousands are expected in Buenos Aires to demand help for
the unemployed. Rumors of political plots to foment violence worry
many.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>For days, this metropolis of 11 million people has been preparing for
the worst. Come Friday, the rumors go -- or maybe even as early as
today -- Argentina will be plunged into a replay of the violent
protests and rioting that brought down its president a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   On the fringes of the city, next to the neighborhoods called
villas miseria (towns of misery), many businesses have shut down for
the week lest they be sacked by hungry slum dwellers. The national
Chamber of Commerce reports a boom in the sales of firearms -- mostly
to worried shop owners.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of people are expected to descend on Buenos Aires
beginning Friday for a massive downtown rally to demand that the
government provide jobs and food for the unemployed. Organizers of
the protest say they are working to prevent any violence.</LD>
<TE>   Behind the fear lurks the shadow of Argentina's most powerful
leaders, including former President Carlos Menem, who ruled the
country amid a flurry of scandals from 1989 to 1999. Menem is running
for president again and is locked in a bitter fight for control of
the ruling Peronist movement with current President Eduardo Duhalde.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the Buenos Aires media have been filled with vague
reports of political operatives offering to pay the leaders of
Friday's protest to start a riot. Many here have charged the two
Peronist rivals with fomenting unrest to create a sense of chaos that
each can blame on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Peronists don't want looting, then there won't be any,"
said Luis D'Elia, leader of the Land and Housing Federation, one of a
number of groups planning the rally.</TE>
<TE>   Peronist political operatives are widely believed here to have
sparked the disturbances that took the lives of 36 people and forced
then-President Fernando de la Rua to resign last Dec. 20. After three
other men rotated through the presidential chair, Congress appointed
Duhalde president in January.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina has remained mired in economic crisis since, with nearly
a quarter of the work force unemployed. Unable to spark a recovery,
Duhalde has said he will resign before completing his term. Early
elections are scheduled for April.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Raul Castells, leader of the Independent Movement of
Retired and Unemployed People, said Menem's allies offered to pay
members of his organization to start a riot. He didn't say who,
exactly, offered the payments.</TE>
<TE>   The former president's supporters quickly denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Castells is lying. Neither Mr. Menem nor his supporters
believe in the argument that worse is better," said a spokesman for
Menem's presidential campaign. "We don't want chaos. What we want is
legitimate rule of law."</TE>
<TE>   Other political leaders and government officials have since
repeated Castells' charges. On Nov. 30, Carlos Vilas, the
undersecretary for internal security, said Menem operatives were
working to destabilize impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhoods. After
Menem's supporters angrily called for Vilas' resignation, he was
fired.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Bonasso, the author of a book reconstructing last year's
political upheaval and rioting, says he believes that Menem's
supporters as well as the Duhalde government are spreading the rumors
of a new round of violence to suit their own ends.</TE>
<TE>   "Menem is trying to position himself as the strongman who can
rescue the country from chaos," Bonasso said. "And Duhalde can say he
is being victimized by a Menem conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   As the rumors grew in intensity last week, the U.S. State
Department issued a travel advisory, warning Americans to avoid
downtown Buenos Aires today and Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Argentine government officials shot back that the Americans were
overreacting. "Even in the moments of violence a year ago, foreigners
have never been targeted and there has never been any xenophobia
against any outside group," Foreign Minister Carlos Ruckauf said.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers of Friday's rally say their intentions are purely
peaceful. They are united behind a series of militant slogans: "Kick
out all the politicians! Rise up, Argentines! For a people's
government!"</TE>

<HD>U.S. Embassy Warns Americans in South Korea After Attacks</HD>
<DH>Citizens are told to be careful in crowds, and a curfew is
imposed on military personnel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Embassy issued a warning Wednesday to American citizens in
South Korea to take precautions in large crowds, and the 37,000 U.S.
troops here were put under an extended curfew in the wake of two
weekend attacks on military personnel.</LD>
<LD>   The most serious of the incidents occurred Sunday night when one
of the U.S. Army's senior press officers, Lt. Col. Steve Boylan, was
punched and grazed with a knife in an underpass near the Seoul
headquarters of the American forces.</LD>
<LD>   "There were three Korean males who were yelling some very
disparaging remarks" about U.S. troops, Boylan said Wednesday in a
telephone interview. He said the men then attacked him from behind
and slammed him against a wall, while one pulled out a knife. "He
lunged at me. I was able to twist away. If I hadn't twisted away, the
knife would have gone into me."</LD>
<TE>   Boylan, 40, had stayed late in his office to finish a report about
an attack the night before. In that incident, a group of U.S.
soldiers said it was set upon by South Koreans whose car had
rear-ended the soldiers' vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The incidents came during a bout of anti-Americanism inspired by
the acquittal last month of two U.S. soldiers who were
court-martialed on charges of negligent homicide in the deaths of two
South Korean girls run over by a mine-clearing vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In a country normally considered one of the United States' closest
allies, an estimated 100,000 people participated in anti-American
demonstrations Saturday. Grievances against the U.S. range from its
policies on Iraq and North Korea to the conduct of the troops
stationed here.</TE>
<TE>   Today's presidential election also has brought crowds into the
streets for rallies.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy reported other
"scattered incidents of violence and harassment directed against
Americans, including U.S. military personnel and other foreigners."
The extended curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. is in effect until next
week to "minimize unnecessary exposure" of U.S. troops and their
families in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Boylan said it hadn't been determined whether the attack on him
was inspired by anti-American sentiments or was an attempted mugging.</TE>
<TE>   In September, three U.S. soldiers were assaulted in the subway and
one was briefly abducted by South Korean students on their way to an
anti-American demonstration.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.N. prosecutors called for 15 to 25 years in jail for former Bosnian
Serb President Biljana Plavsic, but defense lawyers at the Hague
tribunal said that was tantamount to a life sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Closing a pre-sentencing hearing for the 72-year-old, who has
admitted crimes against humanity, prosecutors stressed the horrors
wreaked on non-Serbs in the 1992-95 Bosnian war but said Plavsic's
guilty plea was a mitigating factor. The defense asked for an
eight-year term. A decision is expected next month.</LD>

a maximum-security prison in western Mexico a day after authorities
told him he would be extradited to the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Federal police said guards removed Hector Palma, of the Sinaloa
drug cartel, from his cell and escorted him to an unauthorized visit
with his family.</LD>
<LD>   As guards were returning him to his cell, the power went off and
guards led him to a low-security prison courtroom. Authorities

<LD>The chief U.N. nuclear inspector will visit Iran in February to tour
two new facilities, which the U.S. has labeled suspicious.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency
in Vienna, will be accompanied by experts who plan to set up
"safeguards" at the sites, where Iran is building nuclear reactors,
to ensure that no material is diverted to arms, his spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   These safeguards may include remote cameras and other monitoring
devices. Iran says that the two sites are to generate electricity and
that Tehran has no plans to make nuclear arms.</LD>

<LD>A yellow mini-sub was on its way to seal 14 holes leaking tar-like
fuel oil from the wreckage of the tanker Prestige off Spain, experts
said. The tanker, which spilled thousands of tons of fuel before
sinking, is still thought to be leaking about 120 tons a day.</LD>
<LD>   Spain has contracted with a French firm that owns the Nautile
mini-sub to seal up the oozing ship. The sub plugged one leak last

<HD>Putin Sacks General; Chechnya Talks Raised</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>President Vladimir V. Putin fired his top general in Chechnya on
Wednesday and a Kremlin aide said authorities might hold talks with
Chechen separatists who have put down their arms.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time since rebels led a deadly hostage-taking
raid on a Moscow theater in October that the Kremlin suggested talks
were possible.</LD>
<LD>   Putin dismissed Gen. Gennady Troshev a day after Troshev publicly
rebuffed Russia's defense minister by announcing his refusal of a new
assignment in Siberia.</LD>
<TE>   The general said his departure would mean that he is "betraying
the district's servicemen and the people of Chechnya."</TE>
<TE>   Troshev will be replaced by Col. Gen. Vladimir Boldyrev,
previously the commander of the Siberian military district, the
Kremlin said.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what would happen to Troshev, although some
analysts have speculated that he will try to enter politics, perhaps
seeking the presidency of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kremlin aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said dialogue with
all forces in Chechnya -- including separatists -- was necessary in
the run-up to a proposed constitutional referendum in the breakaway
republic.</TE>
<TE>   "We should find ways to contact those separatists who are hiding
out and are no longer involved in any terrorist activities. If a new
amnesty is necessary, maybe we will consider this," he told Russian
radio.</TE>
<TE>   After the hostage crisis, Putin ruled out negotiations with rebel
leader Aslan Maskhadov. At the time, Yastrzhembsky said that meant
there was no one left to talk to.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the lower house of parliament appealed to Putin to
develop a comprehensive plan for bringing peace to Chechnya and to
resume partial troop withdrawals. The military announced after the
hostage raid that it was abandoning plans for withdrawals.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Court Chastises Army Over Prisoners</HD>
<DH>The rare rebuke stems from the conditions at camps holding
hundreds of Palestinians who have been arrested but not charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>They shiver in tents in frigid nighttime desert air. Dozens of
prisoners share a single squalid pit toilet. Family visits are almost
unknown.</LD>
<LD>   Conditions like these prompted Israel's Supreme Court on Wednesday
to issue a rare rebuke to the army, calling for improvements for
hundreds of Palestinian "administrative detainees" held inside Israel
without trial or criminal charge.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, however, the high court rejected human rights
groups' petitions for a more sweeping denunciation of the treatment
of the detainees, most of whom were arrested eight months ago during
Israel's largest military offensive in a generation in the West Bank.</LD>
<TE>   Over a period of weeks in April and May, Israeli troops took over
most of the West Bank's major population centers, rounding up
hundreds of Palestinians after a wave of suicide bombings by
militants. The army says about 1,060 Palestinians are prisoners at a
remote camp in the southern Negev desert called Keziot; 720 more are
imprisoned at Ofra, a military base near the Jewish settlement of the
same name, outside the West Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   There has been little public debate about the detainees in Israel,
which is preoccupied with a constant and continuing security threat
and by a national political contest tainted by allegations of
corruption and vote-buying within Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud
Party.</TE>
<TE>   Rights group say the conditions at both of the main facilities for
holding administrative detainees -- but particularly at Keziot --
fall far short of international norms governing the treatment of
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so filthy, so degrading, really beyond belief," said Murad
Sana of the rights group Adalah -- Arabic for "justice" -- which
brought the court action on behalf of prisoners at the desert camp.</TE>
<TE>   In its filing, the group told of prisoners' being held for months
in tents in an area where temperatures soar in the summer and plunge
in the winter; of meals eaten either while crouching on the ground or
sitting on cots because there are no tables; of 66 men sharing a
single pit toilet in the open, with no enclosure for privacy.</TE>
<TE>   No family visits were permitted until the last month, Sana said,
and even once the ban was lifted, there was no provision for travel
permits for families of prisoners who are from West Bank cities now
under military curfew.</TE>
<TE>   The army argued -- and the justices accepted -- that conditions,
while primitive, had improved. The military said soldiers in the
field suffered similar privations.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's deep ambivalence over how to treat Palestinians who it
believes may have plotted deadly attacks against Israelis -- but who
have not yet had any opportunity to defend themselves against such
accusations -- came through clearly in the court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "We would not be human ourselves if we did not guarantee a
standard of humanity to those detained within our custody," the
justices wrote. "Such is the duty of the Israeli government in
accordance with its essential character -- Jewish, democratic and
fundamentally humane."</TE>
<TE>   The court took note of the circumstances that led to the army
offensive, calling it the result of "severe terrorist activity"
against which the country had no choice but to defend itself.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities, it said, were overwhelmed by the sheer number
of detainees rounded up over a short period. At the height of the
offensive, about 6,000 Palestinians were in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the justices said, the army should have anticipated large
numbers of arrests and prepared better facilities for holding the
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "There was the opportunity to prepare in advance an area with
suitable detention conditions," the ruling said.</TE>
<TE>   The justices urged the army to make immediate changes, including
housing the men in barracks instead of tents and setting up tables
for meals. "Detainees are not animals, and they should not be forced
to eat on the ground," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The court also recommended that the army consider transferring the
detainees to the state prison authority, where they would be held in
conditions similar to jailed Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The larger question of administrative detention and its legality,
however, was not addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite international criticism, Israel has consistently defended
its right to hold prisoners for long periods without trial or
charges. However, it had quietly moved away from the practice in the
years preceding the current violence, which erupted nearly 27 months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rights groups say that just before the start of the intifada, the
number of administrative detainees had dwindled to fewer than 20.</TE>

<HD>S. Korean Candidate Loses Ally</HD>
<DH>Presidential hopeful's purported anti-U.S. remark alienates
him from Hyundai scion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>A chaotic South Korean presidential campaign shadowed by fears of
North Korean nuclear weapons drew to a startling close when a key
player withdrew his endorsement of front-runner Roh Moo Hyun just
hours before the polls opened today.</LD>
<LD>   The last-minute shock was prompted by a purportedly anti-American
remark made by Roh, a labor lawyer and protege of President Kim Dae
Jung. At a rally in downtown Seoul on the eve of the election, Roh
reportedly said that the United States might start a war with North
Korea and that the South would have to intervene.</LD>
<LD>   That remark troubled Chung Mong Jun, a World Cup organizer and
former presidential contender himself, whose support had been
considered essential to Roh's candidacy.</LD>
<TE>   "Our position is that the United States is our ally and there is
no reason that the United States should fight North Korea," said
Chung's spokesman, Kim Haeng. "The remark was not appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Roh, 56, has been vocal in the past in criticizing the Bush
administration's hard-line policy toward North Korea and Iraq. There
were varying interpretations of what exactly he said at Wednesday's
rally, in which he and Chung appeared together.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of the ruling Millennium Democratic Party suggested
that Chung was actually more upset that Roh introduced two
legislators at the rally as potential future leaders of South Korea,
apparently overlooking Chung's own political ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Chung, a scion of the Hyundai dynasty, dropped out of the race
last month in order to support Roh. Former Prime Minister Lee Hoi
Chang, the leader of the conservative opposition, had been strongly
favored to win before Chung pulled out, but since then, the polls had
tipped in Roh's favor.</TE>
<TE>   Lee's party quoted the candidate as saying he wasn't surprised
that Chung had withdrawn his support. "Their alliance could never
work from the beginning," Lee was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's 35 million voters face a choice between two starkly
opposing camps in the debate over how to handle North Korea. Lee
favors the U.S. approach of suspending aid and dialogue until the
North Koreans abandon their nuclear ambitions, while Roh wants to
press ahead with the current South Korean government's "sunshine
policy" of engagement.</TE>

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>U.N. weapons inspectors visited eight facilities in Iraq on
Wednesday, including six being viewed for the first time since the
monitors arrived last month.</LD>
<LD>   Among the new sites visited were Mosul University and Saddam Dam
near Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad, the capital. Inspectors also
toured the Specialist Institute for Engineering Industries, a water
drainage area, Al-Fidaa Co. and the Modern Paints Co., all in the
Baghdad area.</LD>
<LD>   Outside Baghdad, inspectors returned to Al Nasr State Co. for
Mechanical Industries, which produced munitions, particularly aerial
bombs, that may have held chemical agents. Employees at the complex
also worked to extend the range of imported Scud missiles.</LD>
<TE>   The inspectors also went to a military site in Balad, about 35
miles north of Baghdad, which they first visited Nov. 30. Balad was
among the sites Iraq declared "sensitive" during inspections in the
1990s. Under informal agreements with U.N. officials, notice was
given of inspections at such sites.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new program, the U.N. does not give notice.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea's Neighbors Accept U.S. Hard Line</HD>
<DH>Japan and China won't oppose Washington's strategy of
shunning talks with Pyongyang until the regime ends its nuclear
programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall and Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Despite doubts about the Bush administration's hard-line campaign to
thwart North Korea's nuclear ambitions, East Asian nations have
decided not to openly resist the strategy, analysts in the region
believe.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of significant opposition from neighbors China, Japan and
to some extent South Korea comes even though some policymakers have
expressed concern that the U.S. refusal to have a dialogue with North
Korea until it abandons its nuclear programs could drive Kim Jong
Il's dictatorial regime into a deeper, more dangerous political
isolation.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. has also halted shipments of heavy fuel oil to the North,
and accused the regime in Pyongyang of breaking a 1994 agreement that
would provide the country with two safer nuclear power reactors in
return for a freeze of its nuclear program.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a bit of a misstatement to call the United States the 'bad
cop,' but it's extremely important that Washington take a tough
approach," Japan's deputy chief Cabinet secretary, Shinzo Abe, said
this week.</TE>
<TE>   The dangers of a nuclear-armed North Korea to East Asia's
stability, the belief that America wants to resolve the crisis
peacefully and Washington's decision not to insist that others also
isolate Pyongyang have all worked to reduce opposition to the Bush
administration's stance, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan, which had initially differed with the U.S. on how strong a
line to take, this week underscored that it had no differences with
the U.S. on the issue. China, although clearly nervous about the
administration's move, has remained quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, there were signs of support.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has no choice," summed up Chu Sung Bao, a Korea
specialist at the National Chengchi University's Institute of
International Relations in Taipei, Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the only major public outcry has come from South Korea,
where criticism to the strong U.S. stance has become part of a wave
of anti-American sentiment sweeping the country. Although opposed to
the tough Bush policy toward Pyongyang, South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung's government in Seoul remained silent on the issue during
the final days of the run-up to today's presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Polls were due to close today at 1 a.m. Pacific time.</TE>
<TE>   The dearth of resistance to the administration's hard line against
a possible nuclear threat from North Korea contrasts sharply with the
deep disquiet among the community of nations as it watches the United
States deal with a remarkably similar threat from Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   For its confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the
U.S. has worked hard to enlist skeptical, skittish allies.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, efforts to contain North Korea's nuclear program
have appeared to unravel with frightening speed. The regime in
Pyongyang announced last week that it planned to reactivate a
plutonium plant and end international monitoring of it. That move
came just two months after the North set off diplomatic shock waves
by declaring that it was engaged in a secret uranium-enrichment
program -- apparently for the development of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts note that several factors are at work in the region that
reduce resistance to the Bush administration's tough policy. Among
them:</TE>
<TE>   * Governments in Asia believe that the U.S. wants to resolve the
crisis peacefully. Despite erratic, often-belligerent rhetoric out of
Pyongyang and a credible nuclear threat, the U.S. has consistently
stressed its desire to coax the communist regime toward normal
behavior, not destroy it.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no intention of attacking North Korea," Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell told reporters in Washington on Monday -- just
four days after Pyongyang declared its intention to reopen its
nuclear facilities.</TE>
<TE>   * Asia-Pacific countries view North Korea as a serious danger to
regional stability, especially after it test-fired a ballistic
missile four years ago, indicating that it could soon develop weapons
capable of hitting targets as far off as Alaska or Hawaii. In Japan,
a harder line against North Korea is also easier to sell, with
emotions running high as Tokyo struggles to resolve issues related to
the abduction of Japanese nationals by the regime in the 1970s and
'80s.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan prefers to make the abduction issue its top priority and
have the United States handle the nuclear issue," said Toshimitsu
Shigemura, a Japanese expert on Korean affairs.</TE>
<TE>   China also sees North Korea's nuclear threat as a major political
liability -- one drawing unwanted U.S. attention to the region and
helping justify American arguments for deploying a missile defense
system there. China vehemently opposes such systems, fearing that
they could invalidate its own modest nuclear arsenal or be used to
prevent reunification with Taiwan, which it considers a renegade
province.</TE>
<TE>   * The U.S. has not forced countries in the region to sever their
contacts with Pyongyang. Japan and South Korea, for example, continue
to work on construction of the light-water nuclear reactors that are
part of the 1994 agreement. Both countries continue to maintain
diplomatic contacts on nonnuclear issues.</TE>
<TE>   Although White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer announced last
week that South Korean President Kim had agreed during a telephone
conversation with President Bush that there should be no "business as
usual" with the North until the nuclear issue is closer to
resolution, a spokesman for Kim gave a differing account of the
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Im Sung Joon said that the two heads of state agreed
only that North Korea's insistence on restarting its nuclear program
"cannot be accepted and that North Korea should be asked immediately
to drop the program."</TE>
<TE>   The day after Fleischer's remarks, a South Korean Red Cross
delegation traveled from Seoul to the North Korean resort of Mt.
Kumgang to discuss building a permanent meeting place for families
separated since the Korean War. Another delegation is scheduled to go
to Pyongyang next week for a marine affairs committee meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Japan also said it plans to go forward with talks on normalizing
relations with Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there is plenty of low-level grumbling that the U.S.
approach is too harsh.</TE>
<TE>   In Beijing, Piao Jianyi, a North Korea expert at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, said escalating rhetoric is making
neighboring nations nervous. "We used to say that North Korea engaged
in brinkmanship, pushing tensions to the verge of war, but now it
seems like the U.S. is using this tactic as well."</TE>
<TE>   China and Russia issued a statement this month calling for a
nuclear-free Korean peninsula and urging Washington to continue
talking with Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   But the least receptive audience to the Bush administration's
uncompromising line toward North Korea is in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Lame-duck leader Kim, having devoted his presidency to coaxing the
North Koreans out of isolation, will make every attempt to salvage
his efforts to engage the North until his successor is inaugurated
Feb. 25.</TE>
<TE>   "The South Korean government doesn't like to say so in public, but
they blame the Americans for what is happening," said Moon Chung In,
a North Korea specialist with Yonsei University. "The Bush
administration has created a situation where the North Koreans are
pushed in a corner. And their bad behavior becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy that allows the Bush administration to say, 'I told you so.'

<HD>Report Favors Giving Iraqis, Not U.S., Control of Oil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sentiment is growing in the Bush administration and global energy
circles to place Iraqi professionals in charge of their country's oil
production after any war, despite a push by some officials for the
United States to seize control of the lucrative oil fields.</LD>
<LD>   With many critics convinced that oil is the ultimate objective of
U.S. war planning, pressure is growing to give the United Nations an
oversight role over the Iraqi oilmen. Many experts believe that it
should be up to the Iraqis to decide how to rebuild their battered
industry -- and which foreign companies would get to take part.</LD>
<LD>   That view was emphatically endorsed by a panel of experts in a
report issued Wednesday by the Council on Foreign Relations and Rice
University's Baker Institute, and it is believed to represent the
thinking of many U.S. officials.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of us have confidence in people who were professionals in
the Iraqi oil industry and left the country, and in people who are
still there," said Baker Institute energy analyst Amy Myers Jaffe,
who contributed to the report. "The idea that there's nobody
qualified in Iraq so we're going to have to bring in the Americans,
that's just not the case."</TE>
<TE>   But that conclusion is not unanimous. According to sources
familiar with the discussions, some Bush administration officials
have proposed that the United States assume control of Iraq's
war-ravaged petroleum industry to make sure the oil continues to flow
and the money it brings in -- about $30 million a day -- isn't
misspent.</TE>
<TE>   The debate underscores one of the touchiest aspects of the
administration's preparations for a possible war in Iraq. Although
President Bush and other U.S. officials insist that they are
motivated by concern about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's efforts
to develop weapons of mass destruction, polls indicate that many
people in the U.S. and elsewhere believe that the war, if it happens,
is really about oil.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very sensitive issue," said John Lichtblau, chairman of
the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "There is a
lot of talk that oil may be at the bottom of the U.S. motivation to
go in there. That's exactly what the U.S. government doesn't want
people to think."</TE>
<TE>   The deliberations over oil also reflect a fundamental fault line
within the administration, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   On one side is a hawkish group of civilians at the Pentagon led by
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, sources say. That group
has suggested that the U.S. assert control of Iraqi oil fields during
the transition to democracy. Besides providing physical protection
and financial oversight, such supervision would give the U.S. a
bigger role in determining global oil production and prices, reducing
the clout of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations.</TE>
<TE>   The other group, associated with Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell and the Pentagon's military leadership, has countered that the
United Nations should oversee Iraqi oil production until a new
government is firmly in place. Putting Washington in charge would
alienate the Iraqi people, this group contends, and could trigger a
political backlash throughout the Arab world and in other foreign
capitals.</TE>
<TE>   "There is sentiment in Washington, which is not necessarily
unanimous and not necessarily the president's view, that the U.S.
ought to manage Iraq oil for some period of time, ranging from weeks
to years after an invasion," said Edward Morse, a former State
Department official who now advises Hess Trading Co. on energy
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "It is also my belief that others in the White House and the State
Department have decided not to fight this battle now because they're
confident they'll win it later," Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
declined to comment on internal deliberations over the oil question.
But he said the White House believes that the people of Iraq should
be the beneficiaries of the nation's vast oil reserves, which are
second in size only to Saudi Arabia's.</TE>
<TE>   "Oil in Iraq is the patrimony of the Iraqi people, to be used by
the Iraqi people to provide for their basic humanitarian needs in the
event of a regime change, for rebuilding their country, and
ultimately for providing a better future for their country,"
McCormack said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Iraq sits atop an underground ocean of crude, experts say
there wouldn't be nearly enough oil revenue to cover even the
expenses of reviving the industry, at least not initially. If Iraq
managed to emerge from war with no additional damage to its oil
infrastructure, an uncertain proposition at best, its annual oil
revenues probably wouldn't exceed $12 billion, according to the
council-Baker report.</TE>
<TE>   It would cost an estimated $5 billion to repair damage inflicted
on Iraq's oil fields during its eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s
and the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and $20 billion to restore the
country's electrical generating capacity, which is needed to keep the
wells pumping. Annual oil field operating expenses would consume $3
billion more.</TE>
<TE>   Boosting Iraq's oil production to its full potential would require
"tens of billions" of dollars more in investment capital, the report
says. Experts predict that Iraqi production could rise from its
current 2 million barrels a day to as much as 6 million barrels in
several years.</TE>
<TE>   Those needs would have to compete with the equally staggering
costs of providing humanitarian relief and financing the country's
other reconstruction needs.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts say the logical solution is for the professional
cadre of a reconstituted Iraqi National Oil Co. to assemble an
international consortium of big oil companies to help provide the
money, expertise and technology needed to do the job as quickly as
possible. In return, the companies would receive a share of
production revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The report says the existing U.N. "oil-for-food" program provides
a ready-made structure for ensuring that Iraqi oil revenue is used to
protect and rebuild the country, and for adjudicating any legal
disputes over prewar oil development contracts with countries
including Russia, France and China.</TE>
<TE>   The report's authors urged the Bush administration to issue
official statements guaranteeing Iraq's full national ownership and
control over its resources and to launch a "public diplomacy
campaign" to dispel the perception that the U.S. is plotting to take
over the country's oil assets.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't necessarily mean the United States would exert no
influence over postwar oil production, or that U.S.-based companies
would be excluded. "To the extent it can bring help to Iraq, to
rehabilitate the oil industry and the infrastructure, the U.S. could
play a key role," said Fadhil Chalabi, a former OPEC and Iraqi oil
official who heads the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
Adam Sieminski, global oil strategist for Deutsche Bank in London,
said administration officials who favor U.S. control of postwar oil
production are underestimating the will of Iraqis to control their
own destiny.</TE>
<TE>   "What anybody in the U.S. might like to do in Iraq is going to be
subject to what the Iraqis would like to do in Iraq," Sieminski said.</TE>

<HD>New Era Dawns in Missile Defense</HD>
<DH>Bush's plan to deploy a system by 2004 brings barely a word
from Moscow, a far cry from when the issue was a major source of
tension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>It was once a major bone of contention that seemed to threaten a
resumption of Cold War tensions between Moscow and Washington.</LD>
<LD>   But in yet another sign of how the world has changed, Russia
muttered barely a word of protest Wednesday following the
announcement by President Bush that the United States will begin
deploying interceptor missiles for a national missile defense system
within two years.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, on an official visit to Japan,
made what one analyst called a "flaccid" statement of regret. Mostly,
Russian officials passed over the U.S. decision in silence.</LD>
<TE>   In a brief, mildly worded communique, the Foreign Ministry said it
regretted the U.S. decision and hoped that the United States would
put its main focus on developing a new strategic relationship with
Russia, rather than engaging in a "destabilizing strategic defensive
arms race, including in space." It said that the creation of a
missile shield should not distract resources "from real challenges
and threats -- primarily international terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   At a summit between Bush and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin
in May, Russia abandoned active protest of the proposed U.S. missile
defense system. It was part of an overall package of agreements in
which the two countries agreed to a strategic relationship that would
include closer cooperation and consultation and deep, mutually
agreed-upon cuts in offensive nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the U.S. stance to build a national missile defense
represents a sharp turning point from arms pacts negotiated more than
three decades ago, and it still arouses resentment among some
officials here.</TE>
<TE>   All defensive missiles were banned by the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty, one of the cornerstones of detente between the United
States and the Soviet Union and the base for subsequent arms
treaties.</TE>
<TE>   But as Bush came to office in 2001, he argued that the ABM treaty
had outlived its usefulness and that the risk that rogue states or
terrorists might get their hands on nuclear weapons made it
imperative for the U.S. to withdraw from the treaty.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Russia objected vociferously. Some hard-line generals
threatened to resume deploying multi-warhead missiles that could
defeat any proposed U.S. defense. But the objections gradually
subsided, as Putin and his advisors concluded that it would be better
to focus on winning other concessions from the U.S. in the area of
offensive nuclear weapons rather than a futile fight to preserve a
treaty the U.S. was determined to break.</TE>
<TE>   Putin's quick decision to rally to the side of the United States
after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, and the new
U.S. focus on the war against terrorism, also pushed the nations'
differences over missile defense into the background.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the serious strategic debates on the topic ... ended long
ago," said Ivan Safranchuk, director of the Russian branch of the
international think tank the Center for Defense Information, in an
interview Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He said the two sides had already agreed to disagree, "which
allows the Americans to go ahead and build while Russia can go on
expressing its disgruntlement without any serious countermoves or
threats."</TE>
<TE>   Safranchuk said the grousing may go on, but it was more
significant that Putin himself had not said a word about the U.S.
move announced Tuesday and that the overall tone of the statement
from the Foreign Ministry was not harsh.</TE>
<TE>   "We are bound to hear more echoes of passive discontent from
Russian officials during the future stages of the NMD [National
Missile Defense] development, but they in no way indicate that Russia
is planning to do anything about it," he said. In Tokyo on Wednesday,
Ivanov acknowledged that countries might one day wish to set up
regional antiballistic missile defenses.</TE>

<CX>   ABM treaty -- An article in Thursday's Section A on Russian reaction
to the proposed U.S. missile defense system incorrectly stated that
all defensive missiles were banned by the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
Treaty. The treaty permits each side to have up to 100 ground-based
interceptor missiles ringing either its capital city or a single
offensive missile field.</CX>

<HD>Pentagon Detects Iraqi Troop Movement</HD>
<DH>Hundreds of soldiers are involved. Meanwhile, some predict
Hussein will target his own oil fields and food supplies and then
blame the U.S.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Armored units of the Republican Guard have moved from their garrisons
near Baghdad to an area about 40 miles west of the capital in the
most significant deployment by President Saddam Hussein in two years,
Pentagon intelligence officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The movement of what appears to be several hundred soldiers, along
with tanks and artillery, to the new location appears to be an effort
by the Iraqi leader to flex his military muscles in response to
increased U.S. preparations for war.</LD>
<LD>   "When you move this size of force, it's a great strain to the
military, it's a great signal of resolve," a U.S. official said.
"This is the largest defensive preparation that we've seen since
9/11."</LD>
<TE>   Iraqi military forces have also begun placing obstacles on the
runways of key air bases, U.S. defense and intelligence officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The barriers, detected recently by American spy satellites, could
delay or stop an attack that relied on fixed-wing aircraft bringing
in troops to seize the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqis fear that U.S. forces will try to occupy the remote bases
as staging areas for an attack on Baghdad and other parts of central
Iraq, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials also said the Pentagon increasingly believes
Hussein will pursue a "scorched earth" campaign if there is war with
the United States, targeting his own oil fields, food supplies and
power plants and blaming America for the devastation.</TE>
<TE>   But other U.S. intelligence officials disagreed, saying there is
little evidence he will pursue such a policy.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's forces have been preparing for a war with the United States
and its British allies since the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks,
defense officials said. U.S. surveillance craft have periodically
spied Iraqi troops digging trenches and transferring ammunition from
large central warehouses to smaller depots where it can be more
easily distributed to troops.</TE>
<TE>   But deploying hundreds of troops and the arms, artillery,
vehicles, support equipment and supplies they need is seen as a major
political signal by Hussein that his army is capable of meeting the
logistical challenge of moving its forces from one place to another.</TE>
<TE>   "This takes a great deal of effort. It takes money; it takes
resources to support a group of soldiers operating away from home
base," the U.S. official said. "This is their way to say to us, 'Hey
if you think you have intentions of coming after us, we're going to
defend Iraq.' "</TE>
<TE>   The official said there is no evidence that the troops were
actively engaged in military exercises in the western desert. And he
stressed that the deployment did not pose a threat to any of Iraq's
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an operational deployment for them," the official said.
"It's ... defensive in nature rather than offensive."</TE>
<TE>   Spy satellites have detected defensive moves at air bases in
southeastern Iraq and around Baghdad and in far western Iraq at a
complex of military bases called H-3.</TE>
<TE>   The complex includes several long runways that can accommodate
heavy transports. U.S. defense intelligence officials suspect that
some missiles may be stored at or near the bases. The bases have been
little used by the Iraqi air force because they lie within a zone
where flights by Iraqi aircraft have been banned since the 1991
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis are blocking runways at the various air bases by
parking trucks in landing areas and dragging concrete highway
barriers across airstrips. The Iraqis could move the obstacles aside
quickly to allow their own forces to use the airfields. But the
barriers would force U.S. planners to consider riskier or more
time-consuming approaches during an invasion, such as a
helicopter-borne assault or a land attack.</TE>
<TE>   The troop movements and the placing of obstacles on airstrips
appear to contradict what U.S. intelligence officials say is the
serious decline of the morale and training of the Iraqi military
since the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi military is considerably smaller than the force that
opposed coalition troops in the war.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi army had 70 divisions in 1991 but has only 23 today, and
its Republican Guard is half its 12-division strength of 11 years
ago, said a defense intelligence official who is an expert in Iraq's
military capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi forces suffer from chronic personnel and equipment
shortages, and its air force has been in seeming disarray for years,
the official said.</TE>

<HD>Military Takeover of Police Halted</HD>
<DH>Venezuelan court gives control back to mayor. Ruling is a
blow to President Chavez.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered the federal government Wednesday to
halt its military takeover of the Caracas police force and give
control back to Mayor Alfredo Pena, a leading opponent of President
Hugo Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   The decision came as thousands of whistle-blowing, flag-waving
anti-Chavez demonstrators choked the capital by blocking roads on the
17th day of a strike aimed at forcing Chavez to resign or agree to
early elections. The general strike has severely curtailed
Venezuela's oil output.</LD>
<LD>   Last month's takeover of the police force helped trigger the
strike. Chavez ordered the military to take control of police
stations in Caracas on Nov. 16, charging that Pena had failed to
resolve a six-week labor dispute and saying that officers had
routinely repressed pro-government demonstrations.</LD>
<TE>   But the police chief refused to resign, and many officers in the
9,000-strong department refused to recognize Chavez's handpicked
replacement. The chief then filed suit.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court ordered Chavez's appointee to hand over a police
precinct that serves as a communications center.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Chavez's government decreed several strike-breaking
measures. Citing national security and the need to guarantee fuel and
food deliveries, the government authorized the military to commandeer
private ships, trucks and planes to keep goods moving.</TE>

<LD>   Patton's "conditional commutation" covered 567 prisoners, all
described as nonviolent offenders who, on average, were within 80
days of completing their sentences. Of that group, 363 were scheduled
for release on Wednesday, and the rest on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Patton's order was part of a plan to avert a $6-million deficit in

<LD>   Last month, the Manhattan district attorney asked Justice Charles
Tejada to throw out the convictions based on new DNA evidence that
implicates Matias Reyes, a convicted rapist who has confessed to the
Central Park assault.</LD>

the economy still struggling, says a U.S. Conference of Mayors study.</LD>
<LD>   Emergency food requests rose about 19% this year, according to the
survey of 25 cities. Meanwhile, demand for emergency shelter
increased in 18 of the 25 cities, by an average of 19%.</LD>

among the reasons highlighted for the increases.</LD>

<LD>The United States suffered the biggest reported outbreak of West Nile
encephalitis in the world this year, a federal disease control expert
said.</LD>
<LD>   Now, officials are wondering whether the situation will be as bad
or worse next year.</LD>
<LD>   The 2,500 cases of West Nile encephalitis and meningitis surpassed
by far earlier outbreaks in Israel, Russia and Romania, said Dr. Roy
Campbell, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta. The virus, which has now hit all but five
states, killed 230 in 2002.</LD>

<HD>Duke Admits Bilking Backers</HD>
<DH>White supremacist pleads guilty to mail fraud and cheating
on his taxes. Prosecutors say he told supporters he was in dire
straits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan K. Stack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>David Duke, the onetime Ku Klux Klansman and politician whose
vitriolic crusade for white power and anti-Semitism seared an
ill-fated trail through Louisiana government, pleaded guilty
Wednesday to mail fraud and filing a false tax return.</LD>
<LD>   The 52-year-old Duke has spent the last two years drumming up
support in Russia for activists that he hoped would lead a worldwide
wave of white supremacy.</LD>
<LD>   In a plea-bargain with Louisiana prosecutors, he faces up to 15
months in prison and $10,000 in fines for bilking supporters out of
hundreds of thousands of dollars and lying about his earnings. For
1998, the New Orleans native told tax collectors that he had earned
less than $19,000, according to a federal indictment. In fact, he
earned more than $65,000 that year.</LD>
<TE>   From 1993 to 1999, the former state senator signed and mailed
pleas for help -- claiming that his home and savings were about to be
consumed by a pending lawsuit. But prosecutors say Duke wasn't in
financial trouble. He pocketed the checks and cash that came pouring
in, or gambled the money away in Las Vegas, Mississippi and the
Bahamas, prosecutor Jim Letten said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities had been investigating Duke since 1999 and
negotiating with his lawyer while he traveled overseas. Duke recently
returned to the United States to visit his ailing father in New
Jersey, then arrived in New Orleans to appear before U.S. District
Judge Eldon E. Fallon. He is free until his March sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Duke's strange and tumultuous rise began at Louisiana State
University, where he draped his room in Nazi memorabilia and gave the
first of uncounted speeches about white power and Jewish conspiracy.
He eventually softened his Nazi affiliations, joined the ranks of the
Klan and became grand wizard in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he became notorious for his outbursts. He smeared
his features in blackface and disrupted a 1976 Louisiana legislative
ceremony honoring a black Reconstruc- tion-era governor. He ran for
the state Senate and lost. He was linked to a riot in Jefferson
Parish, and to the disruption of a civil rights march in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, he left the Klan and started the splinter National Assn.
for the Advancement of White People. He ran for president in 1988 and
lost again.</TE>
<TE>   Duke finally achieved elected office in 1989 as a Republican, when
he beat out a complacent incumbent to be elected state senator from
the New Orleans suburb of Metairie. As a legislative hand, he was
totally ineffective -- not one of his bills ever got out of
committee.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Duke collected 43.5% of the vote in the primary for
U.S. Senate but lost anyway. And in 1991, he humiliated the
Republican Party and Louisiana liberals alike by beating GOP
incumbent Buddy Roemer in the gubernatorial primary, but he went on
to lose to Democrat Edwin W. Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Duke's campaigns rarely turned on overt intolerance, but relied
instead on the coded language that has sprung up in the New South to
soften the edges of racism. Duke railed against urban crime rates,
welfare dependence and affirmative action.</TE>
<TE>   "In his own way, he was effective in voicing some of the fears and
alienations that many white people in the lower and middle classes
feel," said Michael Kurtz, dean of Southeastern Louisiana
University's graduate school.</TE>
<TE>   "He came along, I hate to say it, at the right moment," Kurtz
said.</TE>
<TE>   But after his failed bid for governor, Duke faded from the state's
political landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he began a tour of Eastern Europe, where he stumped for
white power and worked on a pair of books -- "The Ultimate
Supremacism: An Examination of the Jewish Question" and "For the Love
of My People."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the lectern, he rallied support for "racially aware"
parties that he hoped would set off a "domino effect that would
cascade throughout the whole world," according to an essay posted on
the Web site of the National Organization for European American
Rights, a group led by Duke.</TE>
<TE>   The manifesto issues somber warnings on the perils of racially
mixed marriages, the "Jewish-dominated news and entertainment media"
and lower white birthrates.</TE>
<TE>   "Our race faces a worldwide genetic catastrophe," Duke writes.
"Anyone who truly understands this must shoulder the immense
responsibility associated with this impending catastrophe.... Our
race will survive, and together we shall go to the stars!"</TE>

<HD>At Last, Designs That Will Stand the Test of Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few architectural events have elicited as great a public frenzy as
the unveiling of nine new proposals for the ground zero site in
Manhattan. But this time the quality of the designs merits the
attention.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals offer the first visions for the site's future that
can both do justice to the memory of the victims of the Sept. 11
attacks and elevate Manhattan's architectural landscape to new
heights. Almost all the schemes represent a level of thought that has
so far been missing in the selection process. The best of them are
powerful expressions of loss and renewal. They are examples of what a
first-rate creative imagination can accomplish when given the freedom
to experiment.</LD>
<LD>   The unveiling capped a two-month competition among seven teams
that included some of the world's most celebrated architectural
talents. The teams range from United Architects -- a group made up of
some of the profession's youngest stars -- to more established voices
such as the British Modernist Norman Foster.</LD>
<TE>   In terms of pure visual impact, the United Architects proposal
ranks at the top of the list. The team -- all architects in their
late 30s or early 40s -- includes Los Angeles-based Greg Lynn, Reiser
Umemoto of New York, and Ben van Berkel and Catherine Bos of UN
Studio in Rotterdam.</TE>
<TE>   The design starts with an enormous void -- 75 feet deep -- that
connects the footprints of the former Trade Center towers and
encloses a memorial park. Five asymmetrical towers wrap around two
sides of this space, their faceted, splayed forms bulging at the core
to create a continuous band that links them 60 stories above ground.</TE>
<TE>   Connecting the buildings has a practical function: It gives them a
high degree of structural stability while providing an endless
variety of escape routes to the ground. But it also allows the
designers to create a compelling architectural narrative. Broad ramps
lead down into the void. Above, the towers' forms join to create a
series of enormous Gothic arches. The openings frame remarkable views
of the cityscape.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing for Evolution</TE>
<TE>   The abstraction of the forms, however, would also allow for the
meaning of that narrative to shift over time. The procession down
into the void, for example, suggests a descent into the grave; the
view back up through arches evokes a sense of spiritual renewal.
Decades from now, that sequence of experiences will inevitably become
less charged. What will remain is the beauty of the forms, a
testament to the durability of the creative spirit.</TE>
<TE>   How the architecture's symbolic meaning will evolve, in fact, is
critical to evaluating the success of each project. The design by the
Berlin-based architect Daniel Libeskind, for example, echoes many of
the components of the United Architects plan. The memorial site --
this one six acres in size -- is carved out of the ground. A
composition of low- and high-rise buildings frames the site's
northern and eastern edges. A pedestrian promenade sweeps over West
Street, linking the site to the World Financial Center.</TE>
<TE>   Where Libeskind's and United Architects' projects differ is in
their expressive intent. In Libeskind's version, the pit is literally
scraped clean, exposing both the raw bedrock underneath Manhattan and
two massive slurry walls that seal the underground site off from the
Hudson River. The cube-like glass form of a memorial museum leans out
over the void. Above, the towers' angular forms enclose a series of
wedge-shaped parks that pierce the site from various sides.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a work of remarkable, almost brutal intensity. The
jagged towers rise out of a base of lower buildings, giving the
composition a human scale. A single sliver-like tower -- conceived as
a vertical garden -- soars 1,776 feet from a corner of the site. But
the void dominates the design, creating a permanent reminder of the
unspeakable acts that took place there.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the delicate, abstract forms of a scheme by Norman
Foster seem an apparition from an earlier age. At 67, Foster has
established himself as a leader of high-tech Modernism, and his
design has the kind of dignity and restraint one would expect from an
established old master. Two slender towers -- about 40 stories taller
than the original twin towers -- anchor the site's eastern edge,
their faceted glass forms so close together that they seem to be
caressing each other. The rest of the site is transformed into a park
that filters out to the waterfront. The footprints of the former twin
towers sink into the ground, evoking the memory of the towers'
absence. Of all the schemes, this one is the most subdued. The voids,
though a powerful gesture, do not dominate the design. The towers'
soaring forms are emblems of pure optimism. The park helps to fuse
the site into the surrounding urban landscape.</TE>
<TE>   A Quiet Dignity</TE>
<TE>   That return to almost classical Modernist themes can also be
gleaned in a proposal by a team of New York's most renowned
architectural heavyweights, most of whom first came to prominence in
the 1970s. The team consists of Richard Meier, the designer of the
Getty Center; Charles Gwathmey; Peter Eisenman; and Steven Holl.</TE>
<TE>   In a video presentation, the team said it wanted to imbue the
project with a sense of quiet dignity. Its most dominant feature is
five symmetrical towers that form an L around the site. Horizontal
bands join the towers at various levels, creating a shimmering
glass-and-steel matrix. At ground level, the buildings frame a series
of giant portals that lead into the memorial site. The footprints of
the original towers become reflecting pools -- each one acre in size.
Two parks extend west through the existing World Financial Center and
out over the river.</TE>
<TE>   The parks are the design's most poetic gesture. Their forms trace
the shadows that the twin towers cast the moment before their
collapse. One can imagine them as zones of tranquillity, the water
evoking a portal to our collective memories.</TE>
<TE>   But where Foster's scheme is delicate, this one appears more
forbidding. The towers, in particular, are overscaled. They evoke an
image of corporate power, crisp and modern in sensibility but one
that threatens to overwhelm the skyline.</TE>
<TE>   The quality of the remaining projects drops off measurably.
Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, a large corporate firm not particularly
known for producing innovative designs, joined forces with two
younger architects, Los Angeles-based Michael Maltzan and Willem Jan
Neutelings of the Netherlands. The team chose to ignore the
footprints of the former tower, instead sprinkling smaller memorial
sites throughout the project. The design includes a dense cluster of
nine towers, some of which rise out of a reflecting pool. A series of
memorial gardens cuts through the towers at various levels.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the gardens, however, the design is largely
conventional -- a grid of skyscrapers that seem eerily isolated from
the city's fabric.</TE>
<TE>   Think, a team that includes the New York architects Rafael Vinoly
and Frederic Schwartz and Shigeru Ban of Tokyo, produced three
separate proposals. But like the SOM scheme, none is particularly
compelling. In the worst, the architects enclose the majority of the
site underneath an enormous glass-and-steel canopy. Covering 13
acres, the canopy would essentially create the world's largest atrium
-- a notion that contributes little to the landscape of Manhattan and
even less to the memory of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   The final scheme is by Peterson/Littenberg, the one holdover from
the first round of teams whose proposals were so ignobly rejected in
July. Peterson/Littenberg's new scheme includes two towers decorated
with historical flourishes. The towers and promenade are clearly
meant to evoke the city's distant past. But seen next to the new,
improved proposals, this one's real worth is to remind us of how
offensive such a lack of imagination seems in a context loaded with
emotional meaning.</TE>
<TE>   From Many, One</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether any of these new proposals will survive
in their current incarnation. The agency plans to reduce the list to
three finalists by early February and pick a final design in
subsequent months. But it is possible that whoever is chosen will be
asked to incorporate some aspects of the other designs into a final
scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Port Authority of New York/New Jersey, which owns
the site, has hired New York-based Ehrenkrantz Eckstut &amp; Kuhn
Architects to develop its own master plan for ground zero. The firm,
which is mostly known for designing large-scale commercial
developments, could eventually play a major role in working out a
final design.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, whether the LMDC and the Port Authority press forward
with a design of significant architectural merit may depend on
continued public pressure. The outcry that followed the release of
the first set of proposals in July was critical in raising the level
of talent to this point. That kind of pressure will now be needed to
ensure that the best design is chosen -- and not diluted by a
byzantine political process.</TE>

<TE>   Gardens of the World</TE>
<TE>   Architect: Studio Daniel Libeskind</TE>
<TE>   A plan by Berlin architect Daniel Libeskind, who designed that
city's Jewish Museum and is working on the Denver Art Museum, calls
for a memorial some 70 feet deep into ground zero. The architect says
the slurry walls built on bedrock foundations that survived the
attack reveal the "dimensions of life." Under the plan, PATH trains
continue to cross the ground, as before, "linking the past to the
future." An elevated walkway encircles the memorial site so everyone
can see "the resurgence of life."</TE>
<TE>   Creates two large public places, the Park of Heroes and the Wedge
of Light. Each year on Sept. 11 between 8:46 a.m., when the first
airplane hit, and 10:28 a.m., when the second tower collapsed, "the
sun will shine without shadow, in perpetual tribute to altruism and
courage."</TE>
<TE>   Includes a 1,776-foot-high skyscraper called the Gardens of the
World.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vertical City</TE>
<TE>   Architect: Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</TE>
<TE>   This proposal from New York-based Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill --
the firm that built Chicago's Sears Tower -- reconnects the city by
creating a dense grid of vertical structures to support multiple
strata of public and cultural spaces. The project contains nine
buildings and acres of public and cultural space. It is self-reliant,
recycling water and exchanging heat to diminish energy costs.</TE>
<TE>   A multiple-level structure to include commercial and cultural
spaces and a sky garden linked by bridges and terraces</TE>
<TE>   A reflecting pool passes over the footprints of the former towers
and brings light to the transit station below</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Garden</TE>
<TE>   Architect: Peterson/Littenberg Architecture and Urban Design</TE>
<TE>   The central focus of this proposal from the Manhattan-based
husband-and-wife team of Steven Peterson and Barbara Littenberg is
the garden, sunken below the streets and located behind adjacent
blocks, serving as "an inner courtyard for the whole city, a place of
refuge."</TE>
<TE>   Creates new city district, with a public garden as its central
element</TE>
<TE>   South Tower footprint would be a pool; the North Tower footprint
would contain a 2,797-seat amphitheater, one for each victim of Sept.
11 attack</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the theater is a museum to the events of Sept. 11</TE>
<TE>   Circling out from garden and amphitheater are boulevards, squares,
towers and parks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sky Park</TE>
<TE>   Architect: Think Design</TE>
<TE>   Think Design, a group of architects based in the U.S., Europe and
Japan, drew three plans -- dependent on the amount of funding. The
architects say: "Ground zero should emerge from this tragedy as the
first truly Global Center, a place where people can gather to
celebrate cultural diversity in peaceful and productive coexistence."</TE>
<TE>   A 10-block, 16-acre rooftop public park above street level</TE>
<TE>   Cantilevered three-acre lawn with views of the Hudson River and
New York harbor</TE>
<TE>   Footprint of the WTC towers would be open</TE>
<TE>   Includes groves of trees, an amphitheater, cafes, an ice-skating
rink, fountains, gardens and sites for additional memorials</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Great Room</TE>
<TE>   Architect: Think Design</TE>
<TE>   A 13-acre public plaza under a free-span glass ceiling</TE>
<TE>   Two glass cylinders protect the footprints of the WTC towers</TE>

<TE>   2,100-foot-tall building including offices, hotel and a
transmission tower</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Square</TE>
<TE>   Architect: Richard Meier &amp; Partners</TE>
<TE>   Richard Meier, who designed the Getty Center in Los Angeles,
presented a plan that includes a floating "memorial plaza" on the
Hudson River and a park with 2,800 small lights, representing the
individual victims of the attacks. Unlike the contained urban plazas
of the 19th and 20th centuries, the architects say, Memorial Square
is both contained and extended, symbolizing the connections of the
location to the city and to the world.</TE>
<TE>   1,111-foot glass towers on the east and north sides with
ceremonial gateways leading to the site</TE>
<TE>   Two glass-bottom reflecting pools on the west overlook two groves
of trees, planted to mark the final shadows cast by the towers
moments before each fell</TE>
<TE>   Nearby facilities include a Memorial Museum and Freedom Library, a
concert hall and opera house, and performing arts theaters</TE>
<TE>   Buildings occupy 27% of the site, leaving 12 acres for public
space</TE>
<TE>   Two buildings with five vertical sections and interconnecting
horizontal floors</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   United Towers</TE>
<TE>   Architect: United Architects</TE>
<TE>   United Architects, a consortium of architects and firms in Los
Angeles, New York, London and Rotterdam, proposes a series of five
interconnected buildings, built in phases, with the highest tower

in two but "kiss" at three points to form public spaces and
observation decks. According to the architects, monumental walls of
steel and stone will create a sanctuary for private remembrance and
reflection. From within these tranquil spaces only the sky will be
visible, not buildings or trees. Surrounding the memorial sites will
be a new World Square -- a large green park.</TE>

<HD>Interim Boston Archdiocese Leader Calls for a Truce in
Abuse Litigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Bishop Richard G. Lennon, chosen by Pope John Paul II to temporarily
replace Cardinal Bernard Law as leader of the Archdiocese of Boston,
on Wednesday called for a truce in clergy sexual abuse litigation so
that talks can proceed toward a settlement with victims.</LD>
<LD>   In his first news conference since he took over from Law, who
stepped down last week over his mishandling of sexual abuse cases
involving priests, Lennon offered comforting words but generally
stuck to existing archdiocese policies and left open the possibility
that the church could file for bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Repeating a phrase the archdiocese has used several times in
recent weeks, Lennon said he hoped to reach a "fair and equitable"
settlement of all lawsuits that accuse the church of negligence in
the way it dealt with accused clergy.</LD>
<TE>   Accordingly, Lennon said he had asked the church's lawyers to put
on hold all clergy sexual abuse litigation. Such a move apparently
would keep church officials from having to testify under oath and
could ensure that no more internal church files are made public.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning I have asked [archdiocese lawyers] to request that
all parties set aside ... day-to-day litigation activities for a
period of time so as to permit all parties to actively pursue the
potential for a comprehensive settlement," Lennon told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese reached a similar truce with plaintiffs' lawyers
in June, but it collapsed the next month.</TE>
<TE>   Lennon also said the archdiocese may sell some real estate to
raise funds to pay victims if a deal is reached, but he said the
church would not sell assets owned by individual parishes.</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old bishop also made it clear that the archdiocese
could still declare bankruptcy as a way of dealing with the estimated
450 lawsuits it faces from people who allege they were sexually
abused by Roman Catholic priests.</TE>

<HD>Preemie Rate Highest in 20 Years, Report Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The percentage of babies born prematurely in the U.S. reached a
two-decade high last year, driven by an increase in twins and
triplets. The government also found a rise in prenatal care and a
drop in smoking during pregnancy.</LD>
<LD>   Births to teenagers fell for the 10th year in a row, with abortion
on the decline too. At the same time, births to women in their 30s
and 40s continued a steady climb, according to an annual review of
birth statistics that was released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, 4,025,933 babies were born in the United States in 2001,
a small drop from 2000.</LD>
<TE>   There were more boys than girls, by a tiny margin, and more births
on Tuesdays than any other day. The most popular month to have a baby
was August.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the winter months when people are holed up inside by a
fire," said Joyce Martin, the report's lead author, offering one of
several theories.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the trends were positive. The percentage of Cesarean
sections continued to climb, reaching nearly one-quarter of all
births, the highest rate since data became available more than a
decade ago. The rate has been on the rise for five years. Health
officials have hoped to reduce the rate to 15%, contending that
vaginal births carry a lower risk of medical complications for
mothers. But the rates are climbing both for mothers who have never
had a C-section before and for those who have.</TE>
<TE>   Also disturbing: the rise in babies born prematurely, which is
defined as less than 37 full weeks of gestation. The percentage of
babies born that early rose to nearly 12%, the highest level since
officials began tracking this category 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In a related finding, the portion of babies born dangerously small
also rose, to 7.7% in 2001, an increase of 13% since the mid-1980s.
Some of the rise for both factors can be traced to the increased
number of multiple births; in these cases, babies tend to be born
before their due date and smaller than other babies. Older mothers
and women who use certain fertility treatments -- both of which are
on the rise -- are more likely to have twins, triplets and even
higher multiples.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in prenatal care in the first trimester has been steady
for a decade, particularly among Latinos and blacks.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, 83% of women got timely prenatal care, up from 76% in
1990. Black and Latino rates each rose from about 60% in 1985 to
about 75% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   More good news: The portion of women who smoked while pregnant
continued a decline that began more than 10 years ago, reaching 12%
in 2001. The teenage birth rate hit another record low, the 10th year
running it has fallen. Last year, there were 45.8 births for every
1,000 women age 15 to 19. Data reported separately show that the
teenage abortion rate has fallen too.</TE>

<HD>Breast Cancer Genetic Test Refined</HD>
<DH>Combined with other factors, it would give a more accurate
outcome, researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Researchers have developed what may be the most accurate method yet
for answering a woman's scariest question about breast cancer: Will
it spread and kill me?</LD>
<LD>   By combining such a test with existing techniques, doctors could
answer with greater certainty. That, in turn, could ease many women's
fears and enable more of them to skip the grueling ordeal of
chemotherapy.</LD>
<LD>   The approach is still experimental, but researchers say a cancer
genetic test -- perhaps one that is even more accurate than the newly
developed method -- could come into use within the next several
years.</LD>
<TE>   And researchers say the technique could, in theory, be adapted for
use with other types of cancer. "I think that the era of treating
tumors just based on their size, the extent of where they have spread
in the body, and how they look under the microscope -- these days are
numbered," said Dr. Carlos Caldas, a cancer specialist at Cambridge
University in England.</TE>
<TE>   The test was developed at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, with
help from Rosetta Inpharmatics in Kirkland, Wash. The findings are
published in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   About 200,000 U.S. women are diagnosed with breast cancer and
40,000 die yearly, the American Cancer Society says. Even with
tumor-removing surgery, about a quarter of breast cancers that show
no sign of spreading will return elsewhere in the body within 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   Standard prediction factors include the tumor's size, how it looks
under a microscope, and the patient's age, since breast cancer in
younger women tends to be more aggressive. But such criteria give
only a rough prediction. To be safe, doctors provide chemotherapy to
the vast majority of these women, despite such side effects as
nausea.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic researchers have begun to study potentially powerful new
methods to predict survival chances of patients with breast and other
cancers. Even though all human cells, healthy or cancerous, carry
virtually identical genes, they differ widely in which ones are
turned on or off at a given time. A technology known as gene
microarrays, or chips, can show this.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutch researchers used a 1- by 3-inch chip to examine
simultaneously which of 25,000 genes were turned on in tumor samples
from 295 women all younger than age 53. They discovered 70 genes
that, when turned on or off in a certain pattern, predict either that
the cancer will spread and kill the patient, or that it won't.</TE>

<HD>Consumers to Get Protection From Telemarketers</HD>
<DH>FTC announces fines for solicitors who dial numbers in its
planned 'do-not-call' registry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators on Wednesday gave consumers new power to make
their homes off limits to telephone solicitors offering home
improvements, magazine subscriptions and other pitches.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government already bars telemarketing calls before 9
a.m. and after 8 p.m. But the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday
announced fines of up to $11,000 any time a telemarketer calls a
consumer who lists his or her phone number in a "do-not-call"
registry to be set up by the FTC.</LD>
<LD>   The agency also said it would crack down on unauthorized billing
by telemarketers and require telemarketers to transmit caller-ID
information, so that consumers who subscribe to caller-ID services
will know who is calling.</LD>
<TE>   The agency has asked Congress for $16 million to start the
registry and for the authority to collect fees from telemarketers to
finance it.</TE>
<TE>   As the proliferation of low-cost marketing tools has stripped away
the sanctuary that Americans once enjoyed at home, consumer outrage
over telephone solicitations has grown. Marketers now use banks of
computers to make more than 100 million calls a day, experts say. The
calls often come at dinnertime and are frequently from companies that
consumers are already doing business with, seeking to get their
customers to sign up for new services.</TE>
<TE>   In response, California and nearly 30 other states have enacted
laws to restrict telemarketing. When the FTC sought public opinion on
the issue this year, it received 64,000 comments -- most from
consumers angry about unsolicited calls.</TE>
<TE>   "They hate the interruption and intrusion," said Allen Hile,
assistant director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. "It's
in your face and in your home."</TE>
<TE>   Proposed in January by FTC Chairman Timothy J. Muris, the
telemarketing reform plan modifies a 1995 rule requiring
telemarketers to honor a consumer's request not to call again. Once
the registry is funded, the FTC plans to set up a Web site and a
toll-free number to enable consumers to register their phone numbers.
Registration will be free and will last for five years, at which time
it could be renewed. Telemarketers will have to check the federal
do-not-call list every three months and will be fined if they call
any- one on it.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the registry is in place, however, telemarketing could
be under greater siege. That's because the Federal Communications
Commission, which has greater regulatory authority over telephones
than the FTC, is expected early next year to outline its own
crackdown on unsolicited calls.</TE>
<TE>   California's do-not-call law, which was passed last year and
imposes fines of up to $1,000 per violation, will become effective
next month unless the FCC comes up with its own plan.</TE>
<TE>   Direct marketers have opposed the rules as unnecessary in an age
when telephones have caller ID, answering machines and other devices
to intercept unwanted calls.</TE>
<TE>   They also say the FTC's rule will create unrealistic expectations,
since the agency does not have jurisdiction to regulate telemarketing
by airlines, telephone companies, banks and some insurance companies.
Consumers will continue to get calls from these companies, if the
companies make the calls directly rather than contract them out, as
well as from marketers -- such as many newspapers -- that make calls
only within the states in which they are located. Charitable and
political solicitations are also exempt from the FTC rule.</TE>
<TE>   "These new rules don't touch the three major users of
telemarketers: telephone companies, financial institutions and
nonprofit groups," said Ian D. Volner, a Washington lawyer for the
Direct Marketing Assn., a New York-based trade organization. "But
they will have significant adverse effects [on other marketers] and
will drive up the price of products due to the cost of compliance."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups and some lawmakers praised the measures as long
overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "We applaud the FTC moving to crack down on this abusive
interference with consumers' privacy," said Gene Kimmelman,
co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. "My hope is
that the FCC will work closely with the FTC to make sure they
initiate a common process and procedure for consumers to block
telemarketing calls."</TE>
<TE>   Because of its wider jurisdiction over communications, any FCC
action is likely to cover all telemarketing activities, including
those by telephone companies, banks and nonprofit groups.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said the FTC's new rules are "a
giant step forward for consumers who are often plagued by unwanted,
intrusive unsolicited telemarketing."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Widens Terror Crackdown</HD>
<DH>More than a dozen arrests are made over two days in
Michigan, Texas and New York. Suspects are accused of funding rogue
groups.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government, stepping up efforts to choke the flow of money to
suspected terrorist organizations, announced the indictments
Wednesday of seven people in Texas and the arrests of six others in
Michigan. All are suspected of channeling funds to Arab countries
that the U.S. government says are homes for terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said federal officials are targeting
those who finance terrorism as much as those who carry out attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Just as we will prosecute the terrorists who plant the bomb, we
will prosecute the terrorist supporters who write the check,"
Ashcroft said at a news conference.</LD>
<TE>   A 33-count indictment unsealed in Dallas charged four brothers
with money laundering and selling computer equipment to Syria and
Libya, two countries the United States says are state sponsors of
terrorism. All four have been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also names a fifth brother, already in custody, as
well as Mousa Abu Marzook, a leader of the Palestinian militant group
Hamas, and his wife, Nadia Elashi, a cousin of the five brothers.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Customs Service agents, meanwhile, raided several businesses
and homes in Dearborn, Mich., and made seven arrests. Officials said
the people and businesses were involved in illegal money transfers
that sent as much as $50 million a year to Yemen, a hotbed for Al
Qaeda and other Muslim extremists.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, three men in Lackawanna, N.Y., were arrested and
charged with sending more than $480,000 to Yemen without a license to
operate a money-transferring business. The three -- Mohamed Albanna,
Ali Albanna and Ali Elbaneh -- were released on bail Wednesday. They
are relatives of Jaber Elbaneh, accused of belonging to an Al Qaeda
cell in Lackawanna.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials said the arrests over the last two
days were not connected, but were part of an effort by government law
enforcement agencies to cut off terrorist financing.</TE>
<TE>   "The war against terrorism is a war of accountants and auditors,
as well as a war of weaponry and soldiers," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   A Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity, criticized
the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider this part of the ongoing war against Islam and the
Islamic institutions across the world," the official said. "There are
some elements in the American administration who are trying very hard
to harm the image of Islam and to link it with so-called terror,
which is not true, because Islam is a religion of tolerance."</TE>
<TE>   The Texas case involved a company in a Dallas suburb, Infocom
Corp., for which all five brothers work. The company accepted a
$250,000 investment from Marzook, who was deported in 1995 after the
federal government designated him a terrorist, and made payments to
Marzook's wife, according to the indictment. Both are out of the
country. Marzook is believed to be in Syria.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested were Bayan, Ghassan, Basman and Hazim Elashi. The
fifth brother, Ihsan Elashi, already is in custody on charges of
illegally exporting computer goods to the Middle East. If convicted,
each faces up to 45 years in prison and $7.2 million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Ghassan Elashi, the company's vice president for marketing, headed
the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development. The foundation's
assets were frozen by the Treasury Department in December 2001 on the
grounds that it allegedly funneled money to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said Infocom was in the same office park and shared some
of the same employees as the Holy Land foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In Michigan, authorities arrested Mohammed Aidaros Abdulla, David
Nasser Ali, Foiad H. Mohamad, Gamil Manea-Ahmed al-Najar, Hussein A.
Mohamed and Abdulla H. Mohamad.</TE>
<TE>   Customs agents seized records and computers from some of the
businesses, which included convenience stores, service stations and
restaurants.</TE>

<HD>Politics Trumps Science in Condom Fact Sheet, Democrats Say</HD>
<DH>Lawmakers accuse the administration of omitting data that
clash with abstinence policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fourteen Democratic members of Congress accused the Bush
administration Wednesday of playing politics with a new government
fact sheet on condom use, eliminating key information that they say
could help people make informed decisions.</LD>
<LD>   Led by Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, the lawmakers said the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention omitted instructions
on how to properly use a condom and studies showing that condom
education does not promote earlier sexual activity among young
people.</LD>
<LD>   Those topics were covered in the last condom fact sheet, created
in 1996 during the Democratic Clinton administration.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson, the members of Congress wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "The apparent purpose of these alterations and deletions is to
remove information that conflicts with the administration's
preference for 'abstinence-only' programs."</TE>
<TE>   Other Californians who signed the letter include Reps. Pete Stark
of Fremont, Diane Watson of Los Angeles, Sam Farr of Carmel and
Lucille Roybal-Allard of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   One HHS official said the fact sheets were designed to present the
most current scientific information available and to present both
sides of the debate. He added, however, that "how it's viewed is in
the eyes of the beholder."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman chided the Bush administration in October for removing the
condom fact sheet from its Web site for more than 1 1/2 years while
officials updated it. He said he has not been satisfied with the
explanations he has received from Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is an Orwellian trend at HHS," Waxman said in an
interview. "Information that used to be based on science is being
systemically removed from the public."</TE>
<TE>   AIDS advocates said the new condom fact sheet does not appear to
contain inaccurate scientific information. Rather, they said, it
offers far more information on specific sexually transmitted diseases
than the previous version.</TE>
<TE>   But it doesn't help people make informed choices on condom use,
said Terje Anderson, executive director of the National Assn. of
People With AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a squeamishness about talking honestly about these
issues, and I think that's very political," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman and his colleagues also questioned why a second fact sheet
-- about the alleged link between abortion and breast cancer -- was
altered by the National Cancer Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The previous version said women who have abortions have "the same
risk as other women for developing breast cancer." The updated fact
sheet now says the studies are inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   The American Cancer Society has declared there is no conclusive
evidence linking abortion and breast cancer. Its experts contend that
the studies suggesting such a link are flawed.</TE>
<TE>   HHS officials said the fact sheets were written by scientists, not
politicians, and are based on the best scientific information
available.</TE>

<HD>Lott Issue May Derail Agenda Pressed by Conservatives</HD>
<DH>Challenge to affirmative action case before the Supreme
Court may be jettisoned. Judicial nominations are also seen as
imperiled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage and Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The controversy surrounding Sen. Trent Lott may transform the
political dynamics of a number of policy issues, from hate crimes to
judicial nominations.</LD>
<LD>   And the first casualty may be conservatives' hopes that the White
House would take a stand against race-based affirmative action in a
pending U.S. Supreme Court battle.</LD>
<LD>   Key legal conservatives, including Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and
U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson, have wanted the
administration to go on record opposing "racial preferences" in
college admissions in a case involving the University of Michigan.</LD>
<TE>   That issue, to be heard early next year, tests whether the
nation's colleges and universities can continue to give an edge to
black and Latino applicants.</TE>
<TE>   But President Bush's political advisors and White House Counsel
Alberto R. Gonzales have argued that the administration should steer
clear of the case.</TE>
<TE>   While the Bush team has a month to decide on its position, the
spillover from the Lott controversy has tipped the scales against the
opponents of affirmative action, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives admit that they are worried about the sudden change
in the political climate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Trent Lott situation is making it much more difficult, but
there's still an effort to press the administration to do the right
thing," said Linda Chavez, a strong foe of race-based admissions
policies. Chavez withdrew her nomination as Bush's Labor secretary
amid revelations that she allowed an illegal immigrant to live in her
house.</TE>
<TE>   The flap over affirmative action is an early sign that the furor
over Lott's comments seeming to endorse segregation will have
implications that reach far beyond the fate of one man and the Senate
GOP leadership. The issue has increased sensitivities in the White
House, where Republicans fear that anything they do will be
interpreted as racist.</TE>
<TE>   The spotlight on the race issue is expected to transform -- at
least in the short term -- the political dynamics on a range of
issues, from hate-crimes legislation to election reform.</TE>
<TE>   "Given Sen. Lott's comments and the attention that's been focused
on the Republican Party's civil rights record, everything the
administration does now will be viewed through a civil rights lens,"
said Stephanie Cutter, spokeswoman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   The heightened sensitivity over racial issues may also spell
trouble for several of Bush's judicial nominees, including
Mississippi Judge Charles W. Pickering and Los Angeles Superior Court
Judge Carolyn Kuhl, who supported racially discriminatory Bob Jones
University in a 1981 Supreme Court case.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives who are working on the legal challenge to
affirmative action say they have met with key officials in the
Justice and Education departments and at the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, they had hoped the administration would file a
friend-of-the-court brief that opposed the use of a race-based
admissions policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted them to make a principled statement about taking race
out of the equation," said Chavez, who heads the Center for Equal
Opportunity in Sterling, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were up to Ashcroft and Olson ... they would come in on our
side," said Curt Levey, a lawyer for the Center for Individual
Rights, which represents white students challenging the University of
Michigan policy. "But the people in the White House are pushing hard
the other way."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, a key question is whether other Republicans will
respond to the criticism of Lott by showing new support for civil
rights measures they have opposed.</TE>
<TE>   That has been an important part of Lott's own effort to quell the
controversy: He has disavowed his vote as a congressman against
making Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a holiday and made a strong
commitment to support affirmative action.</TE>
<TE>   He also has promised to support full funding for an election
reform initiative that sponsors said would help safeguard minority
voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a longtime civil rights leader who
publicly accepted Lott's apology for his remarks, predicted other
Republicans will face political pressure to show more sympathy for
the interests of minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the more conservative members and moderates will try to
get right on the question of race by supporting legislation that is
going to benefit minorities," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   But a spokesman for incoming House Majority Leader Tom DeLay
(R-Texas) said House GOP leaders had no plans to follow Lott's lead
and put new emphasis on minority interests. Instead, the House
leaders will push ahead with a planned legislative agenda of tax cuts
and support for anti-terrorism efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "These are huge issues of war and peace, pocketbook issues that
are fundamental to everybody, regardless of race," said Stuart Roy,
DeLay's press secretary. "It's not a time to throw in legislation for
the sake of trying to demonstrate some attribute."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Democrats hope that the new focus on racial issues will
make Republicans more receptive to legislation that stalled in the
last Congress to expand the definition of hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats also intend to emphasize the racial component of
issues such as extending unemployment benefits, which go
disproportionately to members of minority groups.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal now is to dust off the talking points and try to weave
in these current racial themes into the debate next year," said an
aide to a senior Senate Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate effect is likely to affect judicial nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Democrats stalled Bush's nomination of Kuhl to serve on
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Senate's switch to
Republican control was expected to clear the way for her speedy
approval next year.</TE>
<TE>   But during the Reagan administration, Kuhl played a key role as a
Justice Department lawyer supporting Bob Jones University in its bid
to keep its charitable tax exemptions, despite its policy of racial
segregation. In 1983, the Supreme Court rejected the South Carolina
school's argument on an 8-1 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal activists planned to oppose Kuhl's nomination, in part
because of her role in the Bob Jones case, and administration
officials concede that her chances for confirmation are dimmed by the
Lott controversy.</TE>
<TE>   A second nominee, U.S. District Judge Terrence W. Boyle of North
Carolina, a protege of retiring Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), is likely
to face stiffened opposition. Civil rights advocates fought his
nomination last year to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The Lott debacle almost surely will kill the chances of his close
friend, fellow Mississippian Pickering. Bush legal advisors
recommended the judge for a promotion to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals in New Orleans largely as a favor to Lott.</TE>
<TE>   But during Pickering's confirmation hearing, it was revealed that
the judge had pressed federal civil rights prosecutors, in a secret
meeting, to treat leniently a white man convicted of burning a cross
outside the home of a black family.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected his
nomination, 10 to 9. But days after last month's midterm elections,
Bush said he would renominate Pickering.</TE>

<HD>FDA Easing Rules for Food Health Claims</HD>
<DH>The agency says it wants to get more information to
consumers. Listings need not be proved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration, saying it wants to help consumers
make more healthful choices, announced Wednesday that it will allow
food makers to list health claims on product labels before they have
been scientifically proven.</LD>
<LD>   FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan also said his agency will crack
down on false health claims made by manufacturers of dietary
supplements.</LD>
<LD>   The two-pronged initiative, the first major policy action by the
new FDA commissioner, moves the agency clearly in a direction favored
by McClellan -- providing more information to consumers while
regulating industry less.</LD>
<TE>   "We are committed to improving opportunities for consumers to get
scientifically accurate information about the health consequences of
the foods they consume, and to enhancing our enforcement efforts
against those who would make false or misleading claims for their
products," McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has required "significant scientific agreement" before it
has allowed industry to make health and nutrition claims for food. By
changing the standard to "the weight of scientific evidence," the
government will make it easier for industry to give consumers more
information, and that will promote improved public health,
administration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But a consumer health advocacy group questioned the FDA's
authority to change the standard for health claims and said the
action could result in more confusion for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's action lowers the standards for health claims for foods
to the standards for dietary supplements that has led to a
marketplace free-for-all of false and misleading claims," said Bruce
Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.</TE>
<TE>   The full impact of the policy is unlikely to be known before the
FDA clarifies exactly how it will determine whether a claim has met a
scientific "weight of the evidence" standard.</TE>
<TE>   In documents released Wednesday, the FDA said simply that its
specific guidance on the matter would "also make clear FDA's
conviction that consumers are partners in their own health care, and
that the perspective FDA adopts in considering whether food claims
are misleading is the 'reasonable consumer' standard."</TE>
<TE>   The National Food Processors Assn., the voice of the $500-billion
food processing industry, praised what it called "a very positive
move by the FDA," saying it would allow food makers to put more
information about health benefits on labels.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that is in the best interest of everyone --
particularly consumers," said Rhona Applebaum, executive vice
president of the group.</TE>
<TE>   But some consumer advocates questioned whether the FDA would be
able to handle the added work of evaluating the truthfulness of more
health claims on food labels -- particularly as it also promised to
crack down on fraudulent claims by makers of dietary supplements.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDA has just made its job harder," Silverglade said. "It
doesn't have the resources to conduct systematic enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law exempts the $17-billion-a-year dietary supplement
industry from most federal regulations. Unlike prescription drugs,
supplements do not have to pass FDA tests for safety and
effectiveness before going on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's authority over the supplements is largely limited to
ensuring the truthfulness of their labels and advertising claims. In
rare cases, when it has proved that a supplement has caused numerous
injuries or deaths, the FDA can take action to force a product off
the market.</TE>
<TE>   But the process can take years. It was 1994, for example, when the
FDA began receiving complaints of health problems related to the use
of ephedrine, the herbal stimulant used in the weight loss product
Metabolife 356, made by San Diego-based Metabolife International.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has since collected reports of more than 100 deaths
among ephedrine users, and in August the Justice Department opened a
criminal investigation into claims that the manufacturer lied when it
told the FDA it had received no reports of adverse health affects
caused by Metabolife 356.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the product, with annual sales topping $1 billion in 1999,
remains on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA said that on Monday, U.S. marshals seized $100,000 worth
of EverCLR, a supplement advertised as a treatment for the herpes
virus, at Halo Supply Co. in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The agency had been trying for two years to get the company to
stop marketing EverCLR as a disease treatment.</TE>

<HD>Powell Adds Voice to Chorus Rebuking Lott</HD>
<DH>It's another blow to leader's effort to keep job. A GOP
senator says it's time for a change.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, the Bush administration's
highest-ranking black official, on Wednesday joined those criticizing
Trent Lott for comments seen as racially divisive, another blow to
the Senate Republican leader's fight to save his job.</LD>
<LD>   In his first public comments on Lott's recent praise of Strom
Thurmond's long-ago presidential candidacy, Powell told reporters:
"There was nothing about the 1948 election or the Dixiecrat agenda
that should have been acceptable in any way, to any American, at that
time or any American now."</LD>
<LD>   Also Wednesday, Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.) called for the GOP
caucus to pick a new majority leader when Congress convenes in
January. Chafee is not among the party's more powerful members.
Still, his comments were more bad news for Lott.</LD>
<TE>   Powell said he "deplored the sentiments" behind Lott's comment on
Dec. 5 that the nation would have been better if Thurmond, now a
Republican senator from South Carolina, had been elected president.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he accepted Lott's repeated apologies in recent
days, Powell said: "I've listened carefully to the statements he has
made. I think he is speaking with sincerity. And we'll just have to
see how this plays out."</TE>
<TE>   Powell's rebuke echoed the public scolding President Bush gave
Lott a week ago and underscored the White House's anger with the
Mississippi senator.</TE>
<TE>   Although the White House continues to say publicly that Lott need
not resign, the distance the administration has kept from him -- and
its drumbeat of harsh remarks -- is hampering Lott's bid to retain
his leadership post.</TE>
<TE>   Several prominent GOP senators continue to support Lott publicly.
But the large groundswell of backing Lott has been pushing for has
not materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Chafee made his comments on a home-state radio station. "It's time
for a change," he said. "I think the biggest problem has been that
[Lott's] apologies haven't connected."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he would like to see Lott leave the position, Chafee
said, "Yes, I would."</TE>
<TE>   At the suggestion of Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) -- a potential
candidate for majority leader -- Senate Republicans have scheduled a
meeting Jan. 6 to reconsider Lott's selection for the post.</TE>
<TE>   Lott has vowed to fight to hold onto the post and on Wednesday he
told reporters in Biloxi, Miss., that he continues to call
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been talking to them, answering their questions, asking
their advice," he said. "I believe I have their support."</TE>
<TE>   Lott also said he had no plans to resign the seat he has held for
14 years. His current term ends in January 2007.</TE>
<TE>   The furor enveloping Lott continued to absorb the attention of
Capitol Hill, the White House and the legions of lobbyists who
shuttle between them.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican lobbyist, who requested anonymity, said Lott and
his allies are leaning on GOP officials to begin saying positive
things about a man who has led the party in the Senate for more than
six years.</TE>
<TE>   "The message from [Lott's] staff is 'We are dug in; we are
hardball; we are going to fight. No one is going to run us out of
town,' " the lobbyist said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, when asked about Lott during a brief appearance before
cameras with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar at the White
House, declined for a second straight day to respond.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush will not
intervene in a leadership fight.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a leadership race, the White House plays no role and
will play no role and offers no thoughts and opinions and proffers no
advice about this matter," Fleischer said. "It is a congressional
matter if it gets to that point."</TE>
<TE>   But another Bush -- the president's brother, Jeb, governor of
Florida -- did inject himself into the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami Herald on Wednesday quoted him as saying that the Lott
furor was hurting the party and that "something's going to have to
change." The governor added: "This can't be the topic of conversation
over the next week."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said he did not know if the Bush brothers had talked to
each other about the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between President Bush and Lott have shown signs of
strain even before the current controversy developed.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, for instance, Lott expressed doubt that any major
legislation -- such as creation of a new Department of Homeland
Security -- should be tackled during the brief post-election
congressional session.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, though, stressed that he expected action and the bill was
approved. In another discouraging development for Lott, the lone
black Republican in Congress, Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, hinted
Wednesday that the leader should consider stepping aside. Watts, who
did not seek reelection, had previously said Lott's apologies should
be accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Watts noted, however, that Lott now faces a "poisoned" political
arena. "I hope that Sen. Lott will weigh that," he said. "And I can
tell you that if it was me, I would not put my family nor my
grandchildren nor my party through that."</TE>
<TE>   But plenty of people on Capitol Hill are highly loyal to Lott, who
has done many favors for lawmakers in a 30-year congressional career
that has included stints as House whip, Senate whip and Senate
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), who served with Lott in the House, said
Wednesday he still supports him and believes he will keep his job.
"We know Trent Lott," DeWine told CNN. "We know he is not a racist."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), in an interview with CNN Tuesday
night, said Lott was being treated unfairly. "It's time to call for
fairness, forgiveness, and let's go from there," Hatch said.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Clinton also weighed in on the controversy. He
told CNN that he believed Republican criticism of Lott was "pretty
hypocritical."</TE>
<TE>   He said many GOP candidates in the South have used the Confederate
flag as a political symbol. "That's the Republican policy," Clinton
said. "How do they think they got a majority in the South, anyway?"</TE>
<TE>   The Republican National Committee rejected the charge, saying
Clinton "should check his facts."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Not Protecting Orcas, Lawsuit Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A coalition of environmental groups sued the National Marine
Fisheries Service on Wednesday over its decision not to list the
struggling Puget Sound killer whale population under the Endangered
Species Act.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time an agency has tried to avoid protecting a
species by claiming that the species is insignificant," said Kathy
Fletcher of People for Puget Sound, one of nine plaintiffs in the
federal suit that seeks to reverse the agency's decision.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department agency concluded in June that although the
orcas are genetically distinct and could be extinct within a century
-- the population is down to 82, including three newborns, compared
with about 120 in the 1960s -- they do not constitute a "significant
population segment" and thus are not eligible for endangered-species
protection.</LD>
<TE>   The fisheries agency has proposed listing the orcas as a "depleted
species" under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The environmental
groups say protections under that law are inadequate -- that only the
Endangered Species Act would ensure protection of the whales'
critical habitat in Puget Sound.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have one without the other," Will Anderson, a member of
the Earth Island Institute, said of the resident orcas' connection to
Washington state's inland sea. "Save the orcas and you save Puget
Sound."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit contends that the fisheries service ignored important
aspects of killer whale biology and culture during its deliberations,
including the fact that the loss of the Puget Sound orcas, called the
"southern resident community," would mean the end of resident killer
whales in the contiguous United States.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, history will judge us by what we did to preserve the
diversity and sanctity of life throughout our corner of the world,"
said attorney Patty Goldman of Earthjustice. "We take this stand
today to make sure this unique population of killer whales will still
inhabit Puget Sound into the future."</TE>
<TE>   The orcas' decline is attributed to a combination of factors,
including declining salmon runs, toxins that accumulate in the
whales' bodies, and human disturbance from vessels and noise.</TE>

<HD>Priest Guilty in '70s Abuse Case</HD>
<DH>Michigan charges were filed against cleric under an
exception to the statute of limitations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest was found guilty Wednesday of sexual
misconduct with an 11-year-old boy more than 30 years ago, in a case
that was filed under an exception to the statute of limitations.</LD>
<LD>   A jury found Father Edward Olszewski guilty of four counts of
indecent liberties with a minor child and not guilty of four counts
of sodomy.</LD>
<LD>   Olszewski's accuser, Albert Green, testified that the misconduct
took place in the early 1970s at St. Cecilia's rectory. Green, now
44, and his two brothers had moved into the rectory after social
workers placed the boys in Olszewski's care because their mother was
ill.</LD>
<TE>   Green, who now lives in Washington state, testified that the
molestation happened "at nighttime, when my brothers [went] to bed."</TE>
<TE>   A housekeeper at St. Cecilia's testified that she didn't witness
any abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Olszewski, who moved to Florida in the late 1970s, was forced to
step down from his Key Largo, Fla., parish in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Olszewski maintained his innocence and said Green had been
stalking him and asking him for help whenever he got into trouble
with the law and with drugs.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the alleged crime, state law required charges to be
brought within six years of an offense. However, prosecutors said
they were able to charge Olszewski because he had left Michigan
before the statute of limitations expired.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney S. Allen Early said he would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing was set for Jan. 30. Olszewski faces up to 10 years in
prison on each conviction.</TE>
<TE>   At least 30 Catholic priests in Michigan have been removed,
suspended or have left their duties since Jan. 1 amid sexual abuse or
misconduct allegations. Some of the cases are under review. At least
17 of the cases involved minors.</TE>

<HD>Twisters Rip Into Missouri and Arkansas, Killing 3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHESAPEAKE, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Residents sifted through debris Wednesday and counted their blessings
after deadly tornadoes swept through parts of southwestern Missouri
and central Arkansas.</LD>
<LD>   Thunderstorms rolled through the Missouri counties of Lawrence and
Barton west of Springfield late Tuesday and early Wednesday, spawning
tornadoes that killed two women and injured at least 20 other people.
A tornado destroyed a home south of Enola, Ark., on Wednesday,
killing a woman and injuring at least 13 others, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Debra F. Pennell, 32, was killed and five people were injured when
a tornado touched down south of Kenoma, Mo., about 1:30 a.m.
Wednesday, Barton County Sheriff William Griffitt said. At least two
homes, one mobile home and some outbuildings were destroyed.</LD>
<TE>   Marjorie Hawkins, 47, was killed and her husband, Larry, was blown
out of a window into a field as a storm destroyed their house in
Chesapeake, Lawrence County Sheriff Doug Seneker said. Fourteen other
people were injured -- two critically -- and about a dozen homes were
destroyed at the nearby Lucky Lady mobile home park.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Hawkins was hospitalized with internal injuries, scrapes and
bruises. A friend, Wyatt Zornes, said Hawkins recalled huddling with
his wife as the storm approached. "They told each other that they
love each other, and then the house fell apart and he was sucked up
into the air," Zornes said.</TE>
<TE>   Lue Stelling's mobile home was among the first hit at the Lucky
Lady. She said she opened the door and saw the storm, grabbed her
daughter and threw herself into a ditch. "At first, it sounded like a
train. Then, it sounded like a bunch of blades cutting things up,"
Stelling said.</TE>
<TE>   Stelling, holding a plastic grocery bag with a few socks, T-shirts
and undergarments she retrieved, was grateful for what she didn't
lose: "I may not have nothing, but we got out alive and that's all
that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Drew Albert, a National Weather Service meteorologist in
Springfield, said the storm system also produced a tornado near
Humansville, Mo.</TE>

<HD>Halt to Ariz. Citizen Border Patrols Urged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Immigrants' rights activists on Wednesday urged Arizona's incoming
governor to stop citizens' groups that patrol border areas looking
for illegal immigrants and smugglers.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Border Action Network asked Gov.-elect Janet
Napolitano to investigate the legality of the armed groups and their
actions, which are aimed at curbing illegal border crossings.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not their job to defend, to harass people, stalk people,
injure people. That's nobody's job," said Jennifer Allen, co-director
of the Tucson-based organization. "They [illegal immigrants] have
civil rights and human rights that take precedence over defending the
country."</LD>
<TE>   There are now at least three citizens' groups patrolling the
Arizona-Mexico border, which has been one of the most active spots in
the nation for illegal crossings in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   In at least one instance, one group seized about 280 pounds of
marijuana from smugglers crossing a private ranch.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there has been no known violence linked to the groups.
However, officials have warned of the potential for someone to get
hurt during encounters between the groups and illegal immigrants or
smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano's office received the organization's report on the
patrol groups Wednesday but has yet to review it, said Napolitano
spokeswoman Kris Mayes.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no room in Arizona for vigilantism," said Mayes. "The
best thing is to ratchet down the rhetoric. What we need to do is
work together for a common solution."</TE>
<TE>   Human-rights groups, such as the Arizona Civil Liberties Union and
the Office of Peace and Justice, are backing activists opposing the
actions of the citizens' groups, as are some local officials and
border residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a government of law," said Pamela K. Sutherland, legal
director of the Arizona Civil Liberties Union. "The vigilantism and
lawlessness they [citizen militias] represent cannot be tolerated,
and we won't let their behavior go unchecked."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the groups said Wednesday that they have taken
defensive measures because law enforcement has failed them.</TE>
<TE>   "Citizens would not feel they have to do this if our elected
officials were doing their job in providing security," said Chris
Simcox, organizer of a militia called Civil Homeland Defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We are humans who understand the plight of people who are fleeing
Mexico, but it is not a situation we will tolerate."</TE>
<TE>   Southern Arizona rancher Roger Barnett said he patrols his land to
protect against people who are breaking the law. Barnett has on
occasion confronted illegal immigrants and held them for authorities.</TE>

<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Two white men convicted in the fatal shooting of a young black woman
during the city's 1969 race riots were sentenced Wednesday to more
than four years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Messersmith, convicted of firing the bullet that killed
27-year-old Lillie Belle Allen, gave a 15-minute statement in which
he blamed the killing on a man who committed suicide two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "Why didn't you tell that before?" Allen's daughter screamed at
him. As family members and sheriff's officers escorted her out, she
yelled that Messersmith's silence made him "just as guilty."</LD>
<TE>   Messersmith, 53, told the victim's family members that he was
sorry for their loss. He was sentenced to nine to 19 years in prison,
while Gregory Neff was sentenced to 4 1/2 to 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I am responsible for my actions of that day, and for my actions
of that day I sincerely apologize," Neff, 54, said. He was accused of
shooting at the white Cadillac carrying Allen, her sister,
brother-in-law and parents.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were convicted of second-degree murder Oct. 19 by an
all-white jury. The charge called for terms of 10 to 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Former York Mayor Charlie Robertson was acquitted by the same
jury. Robertson, 68, had been a police officer at the time and was
accused of inciting violence against blacks and offering ammunition
to some of the youths who shot at Allen.</TE>
<TE>   One witness at the trial testified that Messersmith was the first
of the armed white gang members to shoot a bullet which he and
another witness said appeared to hit Allen. A hail of bullets
followed. Other witnesses testified Messersmith later bragged about
the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Neff said during his grand jury testimony that he fired several
times at Allen because he believed she was armed.</TE>
<TE>   Many who testified for the defendants Wednesday cried. "I'm
begging you, your honor, to please have mercy on my father," Neff's
daughter, Tricia, said.</TE>
<TE>   But a prosecutor said the men had lived on "borrowed time" for 33
years, while Debra Taylor said her mother was dead, not merely in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure none of the defendants would want to change places with
her," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday's sentencing, lawyers for Allen's family said they
have told the city they are planning to sue unless the city offers a
satisfactory settlement before Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Harold Goodman said the civil suit would allege that
police on the street the night of the slaying failed to defuse the
white mob.</TE>
<TE>   Ten men were charged with murder in Allen's death. Six, including
Messersmith's brother Arthur, pleaded guilty to lesser charges, and
another man, Ezra Slick, is awaiting trial.</TE>

<HD>Kent Departs the Giants to Sign Deal With Astros</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as the Dodgers continued to wrestle with their trade and
free-agent options on Wednesday, their division outlook may have
improved.</LD>
<LD>   No longer will Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent provide double trouble in
the middle of the San Francisco Giants' lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the chill of the free-agent market, Kent agreed to a
two-year, $17.5-million contract with the Houston Astros. The deal
includes a third-year vesting option for $9 million or a $700,000
buyout.</LD>
<TE>   As the only second baseman to drive in 100 or more runs for six
consecutive seasons, Kent will trade Bonds for Jeff Bagwell and Lance
Berkman in the middle of the Houston lineup and will evict Craig
Biggio from second base.</TE>
<TE>   Houston officials acknowledged they had yet to reach Biggio, who
was on a hunting trip, but were confident the one-time catcher would
accept another move to left or center field.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't about acquiring a better second baseman than we
already had," General Manager Gerry Hunsicker said. "It was about
making the Astros better."</TE>
<TE>   Hunsicker said that Kent represented "our most significant
free-agent signing since Nolan Ryan" in 1980 and, with Bagwell and
Berkman, "there won't be a National League team with a more dangerous
3-4-5 combination."</TE>
<TE>   Kent batted .313 with 37 homers and 108 RBIs while helping the
Giants win the NL pennant. Dodger General Manager Dan Evans refused
to address how Kent's departure would impact his division rival.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to talk about another team in that regard," he said.
"Obviously, he's a very attractive player and I had numerous
conversations with [agent] Jeff Klein, but we simply didn't have the
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "His contract with Houston represents a $9.1 million [average
annual value], and that would have put us well over the [payroll tax]
threshold with multiple moves still to be made."</TE>
<TE>   In a Houston news conference, Kent, who spends the off-season on
his ranch near Austin, Texas, refused to say if he had other suitors.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants had offered salary arbitration, but once they signed
Edgardo Alfonzo to a four-year, $26-million contract -- on top of
signing free agents Marquis Grissom and Ray Durham -- their budget
was basically blown and Kent's departure was far from a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Still, parting was difficult, even though club officials often
seemed fed up with Kent's tenuous relationship with Bonds and were
angered by his spring motorcycle accident and subsequent failure to
tell the truth about it.</TE>
<TE>   "To say we'll miss him is an understatement," Assistant General
Manager Ned Colletti said by phone. "He was a true Giant. He played
every day, he played hard and his numbers speak for themselves. It's
unfortunate that it largely came down to a matter of timing."</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from Alfonzo's agent Sunday at the winter meetings
and unable to reach an agreement with Kent, the Giants were fearful
of losing both players, Colletti said, and opted for the sure thing
in Alfonzo. Colletti would not reveal what the Giants offered Kent.
However, a source familiar with their talks said that while the
average value was slightly less than the Houston offer, it spanned
three years with a vesting option for a fourth year and a mutual
option for a fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Kent said Wednesday that the talks with the Giants "didn't go as
smoothly as they did with other clubs" and he simply couldn't make a
decision on what may be his last contract under the deadline pressure
the Giants were applying.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a chance to win, be home and be wanted," he said of his
signing with the Astros. "The World Series ended in bitterness [with
the loss to the Angels]. This was the best fit and best opportunity
to satisfy that bitterness."</TE>
<TE>   Often critical of the difficulty of hitting in Pacific Bell Park,
he lauded Minute Maid Park and said, "My style has evolved into that
of a run producer. On this team, I could hit anywhere between second
and eighth and be a run producer."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the Giants' roster has experienced an upheaval.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the departures of Kent and Manager Dusty Baker,
third baseman David Bell left as a free agent, Russ Ortiz was traded
and Reggie Sanders, Kenny Lofton, Tom Goodwin and Shawon Dunston were
not offered salary arbitration, ending their tenure.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants have a budget of $75 million and have 16 players signed
for $73 million, meaning the turnover may continue.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Aren't Too Concerned as Yankees Enter Floyd Bidding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees appear to have entered the bidding for
free-agent outfielder Cliff Floyd, but that doesn't seem to concern
the Dodgers, who until Wednesday appeared to be the only team
seriously interested in the slugger.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't worry about what's going on with other clubs," said
Dodger General Manager Dan Evans, who has about $4.5 million to spend
on a hitter. "We're not going to be impaired by anything anyone else
does."</LD>
<LD>   According to reports, the Yankees contacted Floyd's agent in an
attempt to gain bargaining power in their negotiations with Japanese
outfielder Hideki Matsui. But even if the Yankees aren't serious
about Floyd, they could drive his price up.</LD>
<TE>   Floyd, expected to accept an arbitration offer from the Boston Red
Sox if he doesn't reach a deal with the Dodgers by tonight, is
seeking a multi-year contract in the $8-million-a-year range. The
Dodgers would prefer to pay something closer to $6 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   There were also indications that Floyd may not even be the top
choice to replace first baseman Eric Karros. Free agent Fred McGriff,
who is willing to sign a one-year deal for less than Floyd, "is
definitely in the top tier of choices," Evans said, and the Dodgers
continued to negotiate with McGriff's agent Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   By passing on Floyd, the Dodgers could buy more time and explore
new options that will materialize after Friday's deadline for teams
to tender contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia first baseman Travis Lee is not expected to be
offered a contract and would become a free agent. There is also
speculation that Boston's Brian Daubach, who hit .266 with 20 homers
and 78 RBIs in only 444 at-bats, won't be tendered.</TE>

<LD>   UC Irvine (3-2) at No. 17 Stanford (5-3), 7, KUCI-FM (88.9) --
Cardinal Coach Mike Montgomery thinks his troops need "to go back to
the basics" after they were defeated by Montana and Richmond earlier
this week in their own tournament. It was the first time that
Stanford has lost back-to-back nonconference home games in 21 years.
Point guard Chris Hernandez, who broke a bone in his left foot in
October, sat out Tuesday's 83-69 loss to Richmond after attempting a
two-game comeback. Irvine, which has been idle since Dec. 7, has not
defeated the Cardinal in three tries, but the two haven't met since
1991.</LD>
<LD>   Loyola Marymount (5-4) at CS Northridge (5-2), 7, KXLU-FM (88.9)
-- Northridge, which ends a three-game home stand, has won four in a
row. Much-improved Loyola Marymount is playing everyone tough and is
2-2 against Big West Conference opponents after Monday's 74-72
overtime loss at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Matador guard Curtis
Slaughter, who averages 11.6 points and five rebounds, is a transfer
from Loyola Marymount, where he started 26 games as a sophomore in
the 1999-2000 season.</LD>

<TE>   USC (4-4) at Southern Methodist (4-2), 5 PST -- The crushing
losses to Connecticut and Tennessee are now in the Trojans' rear-view
mirror. USC's struggling offense (55.2 points per game) hopes for a
needed boost from junior guard Rometra Craig, finally eligible after
sitting out a year following her transfer from Duke. The Mustangs
ended a two-game losing streak Monday with a victory over North
Texas. Junior guard Andrea Cossey (14.0) and junior forward Kim
Walter (13.0) are the top scorers for SMU.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor (8-1) at UCLA (4-3), Pauley Pavilion, 7, KBET (850) -- The
Bruins have stumbled with consecutive setbacks to Georgia and
Pepperdine after posting a four-game winning streak. But Coach Kathy
Olivier remains committed, for now, to giving freshmen Nikki Blue,
Julia Pitts and Lisa Willis plenty of playing time. "We're going to
be a young team," Olivier said. Senior guard Michelle Greco is the
top scorer among Pac-10 players (19.1 ppg), although her three-point
field-goal percentage is an abysmal 22.7% (five of 22). Baylor's only
loss this season was to Montana State in a Thanksgiving holiday
tournament, but the Bears don't have the kind of nonconference wins
to enter the Top 25. Sophomore forward Steffanie Blackmon averages
20.4 points for Baylor.</TE>

<LD>Chris Webber, the former Michigan basketball star now with the
Sacramento Kings, recently was quoted as saying, "Look how many
millions the school made off of us, and what did we get out of it?"
That didn't set well with Mike Bianchi, Orlando Sentinel columnist.</LD>
<LD>   "How about a chance at a better life, Mr. Webber," he wrote.</LD>
<LD>   "What do we get out of it? How about the fact that raw recruits
are taken by a university, instructed by the finest coaches money can
buy, nourished by nutrition specialists, strengthened by
state-of-the-art weight facilities and bulked and built into NFL- or
NBA-ready athletes who sign contracts for mega-millions?</LD>
<TE>   "Don't ever again let anybody tell you how colleges exploit their
athletes. These days, it's the other way around. Colleges are filled
with athletes who care nothing about ruining the reputation of their
schools. They stop off for a year or two, eat up thousands of dollars
worth of groceries, then bolt to the pros."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Where was the New Year's Day football game played in
Pasadena before the Rose Bowl was completed in 1922?</TE>
<TE>   Sign of the times: Move over Jerry Lewis, college athletics is
moving into the TV telethon business.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Minnesota, faced with the elimination of its
men's golf and gymnastics teams and its women's golf team, produced a
three-hour telethon last Sunday that raised more than $670,000 with
little more than the school's marching band and pleas from such
personalities as Arnold Palmer, Paul Molitor and Gov. Jesse Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be the athletic director remembered for whacking
three sports," said Minnesota Athletic Director Joel Maturi in
assisting with the Save Gopher Sports committee.</TE>
<TE>   Look who's talking: NFL commentators Terry Bradshaw and Jimmy
Johnson said on TV that they couldn't understand how New York Giant
defensive end Michael Strahan hurt himself lifting weights.</TE>
<TE>   To which Howie Long asked, "How in the hell would you two know?"</TE>
<TE>   Dusty's boy: With Dusty Baker and son Darren now in Chicago, what
is the Cubs' reaction to baseball's new minimum age for batboys?</TE>
<TE>   "It will be 4 for us, 14 for everybody else," Cub General Manager
Jim Hendry said.</TE>
<TE>   Fair warning: Kentucky is rumored to be interested in Oregon State
football Coach Dennis Erickson. Oregonian columnist John Canzano
suggests it might be the right move -- for the Beavers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible that Erickson could stay at Oregon State and
duplicate his 11-1 Fiesta Bowl season from 2000," Canzano wrote.
"It's also possible that we've seen the best team Erickson could put
on a field without landing the program on probation. Does the risk
now outweigh the possible gain [in keeping Erickson]?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tournament Park, now part of the California
Institute of Technology campus.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: During the televised game showcasing Ohio prep phenom
LeBron James, James wore a patch to cover a tattoo, as required by
school rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine if the NBA had that rule," Steve Abney said in the San
Francisco Chronicle. "Fans wouldn't know if they were watching Allen
Iverson or the Mummy."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Suffer Familiar Fade</HD>
<DH>Portland takes full advantage, using a 15-0 run to outscore
them, 30-16, in the fourth quarter for a 97-93 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers thought they were past all this. They believed they put
the fourth-quarter meltdowns behind them. They looked as if they were
turning a corner, gaining momentum and victories after a nightmarish
start of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, they ran into their old selves again Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   There was no excuse for what happened during the fourth quarter of
the Clippers' head-scratching 97-93 loss to the Portland Trail
Blazers at Staples Center. The Clippers gave away a game they should
have won with the same steady play they displayed in the first three
quarters.</LD>
<TE>   Or more to the point, the Trail Blazers took what the Clippers
gave them in rallying from a 77-67 deficit to start the final
quarter. Portland outscored the Clippers, 30-16, in the fourth
quarter, which included runs of 20-10 and 15-0.</TE>
<TE>   This one will sting for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of victories in six of eight games, the Clippers will
consider another in a string of poor finishes that includes
squandering a 16-point lead in a loss to the Denver Nuggets on Nov.
22.</TE>
<TE>   "We played beautiful basketball up to there [the fourth quarter],"
Coach Alvin Gentry said. "All everybody is going to remember is that
down the stretch, we couldn't score. It's unfortunate. It cost us the
game."</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers made 10 of 18 shots in the fourth; the Clippers
four of 15.</TE>
<TE>   "Down the stretch, they scored when it really mattered," said
Clipper center Michael Olowokandi. "We couldn't do anything
offensively. When it matters, when it's like playoff basketball, we
have to run our offense better. You can't help but feel you gave one
away when you had a 14-point lead. If you can't score, at the very
least you can minimize their opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Portland stayed close, thanks to Jeff McInnis, a former Clipper,
who scored nine of his 17 points in the third quarter. The Trail
Blazer rally got started when Scottie Pippen made two three-point
baskets midway through the fourth, the second cutting their deficit
to 87-80.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Clippers were in trouble and the Trail Blazers were
rolling toward a 15-0 run that would take them to a 92-87 lead. Bonzi
Wells led Portland with his second consecutive 30-point game.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to hang around and hang around," Portland Coach
Maurice Cheeks said afterward. "It was a gut-it-out win."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers and the crowd of 16,194 watched in silence as point
guard Andre Miller hit the floor with a thud after a collision with
Jeff McInnis in the first minute of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Miller clutched at the sprained left ankle that has troubled him
since he ran into Sacramento's Bobby Jackson on Nov. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who had 13 points in the first quarter, went to the locker
room to have his ankle brace adjusted and missed only two minutes. He
would score 25 points in 44 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   As has become their custom during their hot streak, the Clippers
didn't depend on one player to get them a double-digit lead in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   This was another group effort, with Quentin Richardson leading the
charge off the bench, scoring a season-best 24 points, including 18
in the second quarter, in 31 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' momentum fizzled to start the fourth quarter, their
inability to make shots or create them when plays broke down proved
costly.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to create things," Gentry said. "We had some bad
possessions in the last four or five minutes of the game. We ran the
same plays we did for the first three quarters. They defended us the
same way. We had the same options."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers simply didn't click.</TE>
<TE>   One night after an impressive 102-93 victory over the New Orleans
Hornets at Portland, the Trail Blazers seemed to be going through the
motions early.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers built a 45-35 lead after Richardson's club-record
fifth three-pointer in a quarter 5 1/2 minutes before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   By the break, the Trail Blazers had drawn close only to falter
again in the closing moments.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson made a hanging jump shot over Bonzi Wells from the
baseline. Elton Brand scored on a twisting layup in traffic. Michael
Olowokandi swatted Wells' driving layup attempt. And the Clippers
held a hard-earned 52-46 lead by halftime.</TE>

<LD>The Clippers reached the 25-game mark in 2001-02 with a 14-11 record,
increasing expectations that were never quite reached. They hit the
25-game mark this season with an 11-14 record, amid speculation that
the best had come and gone for the franchise.</LD>
<LD>   Or at least for this particular group of players and coaches.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry doesn't see it that way. He believes this team
still can accomplish something special.</LD>
<TE>   "Considering the injury situation we have had, we've played pretty
good," he said before the Clippers faced the Portland Trail Blazers
in Game 26 on Wednesday at Staples Center. "The disappointing thing
is the number of games at home we had an opportunity to win, but we
let slip away. We've got to continue to play well. We're starting to
execute better. The whole key for us is we just have to get the
necessary shots down the stretch to win.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see most games are determined in the last four or five
minutes. You've got to be able to execute. It's pretty simple. It
really is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were without shooting guard Eric Piatkowski, who sat
out his fourth game because of a lower abdominal strain. Marko Jaric
started in his place against the Trail Blazers.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Great Failures of the Extremely Successful."</LD>
<TE>   Author: Steve Young.</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Tallfellow Press.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24.95.</TE>
<TE>   There are many books about success stories. Here's one about
failures. In compiling the book, Steve Young -- a Los Angeles writer,
not the former quarterback -- interviewed more than 60 successful
people from many fields. A number were from the sports world,
including John Wooden, the late Johnny Unitas, Jim Marshall, Bill
Walton and boxer Gabriel Ruelas.</TE>
<TE>   Young's book chronicles first-person tales of how prominent people
used failure, mistakes and adversity toward a positive end.</TE>
<TE>   Young interviewed Unitas this summer, not long before he died
Sept. 11. Unitas, drafted in the ninth round out of Louisville in
1955, was cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers without playing in an
exhibition game. He thought about giving up football and becoming a
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   But the following year, after a successful stint in semipro ball,
he was signed by the Baltimore Colts as a backup quarterback. He
became the starter when George Shaw, the former Oregon star, came
down with pneumonia during training camp. Unitas was the starting
quarterback for 16 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt that mistakes in life or in sports were a big deal,"
Unitas said. "They happen.... You can't worry about missing a pass.
If you worried about stuff like that, you'd never do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Wooden talks about almost becoming a civil engineer. He also talks
about his father. "I got my positive attitude from my dad," he said.
"He let me know that it's never about being better than somebody
else. My job was to never stop trying to be the best I could be."</TE>

<HD>Guerrero Uses Hire Power to Take Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Riley was the easy, safe, popular, perfectly fine and perhaps
the right choice to lead UCLA football into the post-Bob Toledo era.</LD>
<LD>   In hiring Karl Dorrell on Wednesday, however, Athletic Director
Dan Guerrero made the bold choice.</LD>
<LD>   This is what the really good administrators do -- identify the
next young star before the public gets wind.</LD>
<TE>   This is what Oklahoma's Joe Castiglione did when he identified Bob
Stoops, what California's Steve Gladstone managed when he plucked
Jeff Tedford off Oregon's staff and what Arizona State's Gene Smith
accomplished when he went to Boise State and roped Dirk (Dirk who?)
Koetter.</TE>
<TE>   What we don't know yet in Westwood is whether Guerrero is one of
those really good administrators or whether Karl Dorrell is one of
those next young stars.</TE>
<TE>   Would you mind checking back in two or three years?</TE>
<TE>   In the end, UCLA's new beginning boiled down to a first-year AD
hiring a first-time head coach and hoping his gut instincts are
correct.</TE>
<TE>   With this hire, too, Guerrero and Dorrell are attached at the hip
-- two relative neophytes trying to make their names together.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Riley, UCLA coach?</TE>
<TE>   We could all have lived with that, even the part where Guerrero
explained why he fired a coach with a winning record to hire one with
a losing one.</TE>
<TE>   Riley would have been well liked and accepted, and possibly
thrived, yet Guerrero could also have been perceived as taking the
easy way out.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he opted for the high-stakes game of risk-reward.</TE>
<TE>   He should be commended short term for not settling for the easy
answer and, while he was at it, increasing the appallingly low number
of African American coaches in Division I-A from three to four.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a courageous move, because Dorrell has no history,"
former UCLA quarterback Tom Ramsey, a Dorrell backer from the start,
said Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously it was not an easy decision. But I really believe it
was well thought out, a very logical choice. When you look at the
logic, it makes all the sense in the world. Karl has ties to Terry
Donahue, and the history and tradition of UCLA, and he has ties to
one of the best organizations, the Denver Broncos, and Mike Shanahan.</TE>
<TE>   "The naysayers will say he doesn't have head coaching experience.
But how does one get head coaching experience? You've got to get in
the field of fire. Well, he's in now."</TE>
<TE>   Only time and two USC games will tell whether this hire was a good
idea.</TE>
<TE>   College football memory books are filled with athletic directors
who rolled the dice on coaches and lost. We remember the smiling
faces and handshakes at news conferences and talk of leading programs
into new frontiers.</TE>
<TE>   Only, it doesn't always work out that way.</TE>
<TE>   There was, for example, Oklahoma in the mid-1990s when it hired
John Blake. You talk about hitting a dry well. Blake, like Dorrell,
was a highly regarded NFL assistant with no head coaching experience,
a man who was supposed to restore order at a once-proud program.</TE>
<TE>   The thinking was it took a Sooner to know a Sooner, some of the
same things people have been saying about Dorrell's being a Bruin.
Yet Blake, certainly a bold pick, was fired after going 12-22.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Paul Hackett mistake cost the Trojans three years of
construction costs in the rebuilding of a program.</TE>
<TE>   How about Stanford and Buddy Teevens?</TE>
<TE>   Teevens arrived in Palo Alto a highly regarded one-time former
assistant at Florida under Steve Spurrier. In one year, Teevens has
turned the Cardinal program around -- the wrong way around.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes you think you have the right coach, then think you
don't, only to find out, hey, you do.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa's Kirk Ferentz was a fallback hire after the school
stunningly failed to land Stoops, a former Hawkeye player and the
presumed successor to Hayden Fry.</TE>
<TE>   After negotiations with Stoops went three bales haywire, Iowa
latched onto Ferentz and Iowans went "Huh?"</TE>
<TE>   The first year, Ferentz put his foot in the bucket by going 1-10
and winless in the Big Ten. Three years later, Iowa is 11-1 and
Orange Bowl bound.</TE>
<TE>   How does an AD really know he's going to get the right guy?</TE>
<TE>   Unless he has an open checkbook and Jimmy Johnson's home boat
number, he doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he does his homework, relies on a few trusted friends and
prays for the best.</TE>
<TE>   There are foolproof plans, of course, to get a wayward ship turned
around.</TE>
<TE>   To solve its recent coaching vacancy/crisis, Alabama simply
courted one of the best coaches from one of the best leagues, threw
more money at the guy than he has ever seen and, voila, Mike Price is
pricing real estate in Tuscaloosa.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, though, was working under a different mandate. It was
his job to bring in the best man $700,000 (plus incentives!) could
buy, knowing full well that next coach would be asked to defeat a USC
coach in a higher tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Some nerve, huh?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, if you haven't heard by now, this is the UCLA way, a
balanced, fiscally minded approach to compensation. UCLA pursuing a
coach is like a shopper screaming from a mall the day after Christmas
-- Did you see what I got for $50?</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, in the case of Terry Donahue, you get a bargain that
lasts 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Other times, Steve Lavin is on the clearance rack.</TE>
<TE>   This time, well, we'll just have to see where it goes.</TE>
<TE>   After he fired Toledo, Guerrero barked out clear and stark
commands.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a national caliber program here," he said. "We want to
compete for the top 10 and be one of the top programs in the country
every year."</TE>
<TE>   What he really meant was "we want a national caliber program and a
coach who knows he could still be drawing up wide receiver plays in
Denver had we not called."</TE>

<HD>Giguere Finally Allows Goal but Keeps Victory</HD>
<DH>Goalie's shutout streak ends in Ducks' 5-2 win over Blues.
String is third longest in NHL history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rarely have fans at the Arrowhead Pond stood and cheered after a
Mighty Duck goalie let a puck into the net ... and never without the
Kings or Detroit Red Wings being in town.</LD>
<LD>   But that was the case Wednesday after the Ducks' Jean-Sebastien
Giguere surrendered a goal on a blast by Al MacInnis in the second
period. The announced 11,144 cheered, to mark the end of a remarkable
shutout streak that stretched 237 minutes 7 seconds, the third
longest in NHL history.</LD>
<LD>   By then the Ducks were on their way to a 5-2 victory over the St.
Louis Blues, a win Giguere helped preserve with more acrobatics after
MacInnis' goal, as the Ducks were outshot, 46-17. But that moment was
one to cherish.</LD>
<TE>   Giguere had managed to keep the streak alive with extreme
measures, including stopping three shots on a power play without a
stick in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Some things, though, are beyond a goalie's capabilities. MacInnis'
flying toward the net during a five-on-three power play, with time to
line up a shot, is certainly one of them. After he buried a shot into
the upper left corner, the sparse crowd stood and cheered ... for
Giguere.</TE>
<TE>   "That gave me some shivers," Giguere said. "They haven't had a lot
to cheer for the last two or three years."</TE>
<TE>   The shutout streak was the longest since 1950, when Toronto's Turk
Broda went 245:33. Montreal's Bill Durnan holds the NHL record of
309:21, set in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere's run was so impressive that its conclusion deserved top
billing over another star-studded evening for the Ducks, who won
their fifth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya had five points -- two goals and three assists. Adam
Oates scored his first goal as a Duck. Andy McDonald ran his point
streak to five games.</TE>
<TE>   "[Giguere] won that game for us."</TE>
<TE>   It was the Ducks' first in a seven-game stretch against Western
Conference teams.</TE>
<TE>   Even Giguere said his performance Wednesday was better than the
three previous games, all shutouts. He saw only 65 shots combined in
those games.</TE>
<TE>   "The streak has been pretty sweet," Giguere said. "I'm happy about
it, I won't lie. But I think they should have all the guys there
behind, because they have been a part of this too."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates did a small vanishing act Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere got through a power play late in the first period, during
which the Blues got off five quality shots, three after Giguere lost
his stick. He was still able to turn away a blue-line shot by
MacInnis and two rebound tries.</TE>
<TE>   So tired was Giguere after flopping around the crease to stop 15
shots in the second period, he plopped down in the net after the
period to rest.</TE>
<TE>   His work was just beginning. After MacInnis scored his second
power-play goal six minutes into the third period, Giguere had to
turn away a barrage of chances by the Blues.</TE>
<TE>   "In his other games [during the streak], I think we gave up maybe
11 scoring chances," Coach Mike Babcock said. "I think they had 11
chances halfway through the game tonight. That's why this game is so
special for [Giguere]. He put us on his back."</TE>

<HD>Deadmarsh to Miss Another Game</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors have not determined what is affecting Adam Deadmarsh's
equilibrium but believe it is probably related to the concussion he
suffered last month, King Coach Andy Murray said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   This much is certain: Deadmarsh, who leads the Kings with 13 goals
in 20 games, won't play tonight against the Mighty Ducks at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI test Wednesday revealed no concussion, Murray said, and
doctors believe Deadmarsh should be ready to play again "in a few
days."</LD>
<TE>   He sat out nine games after suffering a concussion Nov. 12 when
hit by Aki Berg of the Toronto Maple Leafs, then returned to score
four goals in five games. But he was unable to play Tuesday in a 6-2
victory over the St. Louis Blues.</TE>
<TE>   It is undetermined, Murray said, whether Deadmarsh will travel
with the Kings for games Sunday night at Chicago and Monday night at
St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Jared Aulin, who played less than five minutes against the
Blues in his NHL debut, was sent back to the Kings' American Hockey
League team at Manchester, N.H., while tough guy Kip Brennan was
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have faced Jamie Storr in their last three games against
the Kings and five of their last six, but tonight they'll see Felix
Potvin, who in his last start against the Ducks stopped 29 shots in a
4-2 victory Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin is 14-3-6 against the Ducks, 2-1-1 since joining the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To a man, the Mighty Ducks maintain one-game-at-a-time mantra, yet
there are moments when they sneak a peek down the road.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks begin a three-game stretch against Pacific Division
teams tonight. They face Phoenix at the Arrowhead Pond on Sunday and
play at San Jose on Dec. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are 0-4-2 against Pacific Division teams this season.</TE>
<TE>   "All three of those teams made the playoffs last season," Duck
defenseman Keith Carney said. "It's important to get these points,
but this is also going to test us physically and mentally."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Florida State players and others associated with the athletic
department are part of a gambling investigation by state and local
police agencies, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   University police chief Carey Drayton said authorities are looking
into allegations made against players, student trainers and managers,
along with other students on campus, the Tallahassee Democrat
reported for today's editions.</LD>
<LD>   "I already have people ready to 'fess up to us," Drayton said.</LD>
<TE>   Drayton did not identify which people he meant, other than to say
they are not members of the football team.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bobby Bowden said no law enforcement official has talked to
him about allegations involving specific players.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be shocked if any of my players are involved in that,"
Bowden said. "But you never know. You're just nearly scared to say."</TE>
<TE>   Some gambling allegations were made last month, after quarterback
Adrian McPherson was dismissed from the team because of his
involvement in the theft of a $3,500 check from a Tallahassee
business. McPherson was charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing
the blank check.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Price, 56, was introduced as Alabama's coach after turning
lowly Washington State into a top 10 program. Price agreed to a
seven-year contract. At Washington State, longtime assistant Bill
Doba was named to replace Price. Doba, 62, has been defensive
coordinator since 1994.... Defensive tackle Vince Wilfork, who leads
No. 1 Miami with 15 tackles for losses, might not play in the Fiesta
Bowl after the death of his mother.... Bradlee Van Pelt will start at
quarterback for Colorado State in the Liberty Bowl, despite his
arrest last week on a charge of verbal harassment.... Rutgers Coach
Greg Schiano, who has a two-year record of 3-20, received a contract
extension through the 2007 season.... New Mexico State Coach Tony
Samuel was reprimanded by Athletic Director Brian Faison after
allegedly punching video coordinator Ronald Kennedy in a dispute over
the team's annual highlight film.... Tulsa hired Buffalo Bill
assistant Steve Kragthorpe, 37, as its coach.... Brady Hoke, 44, the
defensive line coach for Michigan, was named coach at Ball State....
Trinity quarterback Roy Hampton was suspended from the team because
of his arrest on public intoxication charges early Sunday and will
not play in the Division III championship game against Mount Union
(Ohio) on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Leftwich Has a Leg Up on Louisville</HD>
<DH>Gimpy quarterback leads Marshall to 38-15 win over
Cardinals, whose coach is being courted by Michigan State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Byron Leftwich, playing on an injured left leg, became the first
player in Division I-A to throw four touchdown passes in two bowl
games, leading Marshall to a 38-15 victory over Louisville on
Wednesday night in the GMAC Bowl in Mobile, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   Marshall (11-2) won a bowl for the fifth consecutive year, the
longest such streak in the nation. Top-ranked Miami has won four in a
row.</LD>
<LD>   The game might have been the finale for Louisville Coach John L.
Smith, who reportedly is close to accepting an offer to coach
Michigan State.</LD>
<TE>   Smith, 54, said he'll meet with Michigan State officials today and
declined further comment, but ESPN reported that Smith was expected
to take over the Spartan program.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State has been searching for a coach since Bobby Williams
was fired on Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit News reported that Smith and Michigan State were
working out contract details.</TE>
<TE>   Louisville Athletic Director Tom Jurich confirmed that Michigan
State had asked for permission earlier in the day to talk with Smith
and that Jurich granted the request.</TE>
<TE>   "John L. got a call from Michigan State today," Jurich said. "I do
not expect an announcement tonight, but I am concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Word about Smith's candidacy eventually filtered down to the
Louisville players during the first half of Wednesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole sideline knew," quarterback Dave Ragone said. "I tried
to put some water on the fire, but it was hard to regroup."</TE>
<TE>   Smith took over a program that finished 1-10 in 1997 and has
guided it to five consecutive winning seasons. He reportedly earns
$800,000 a year. In 2000, his contract was extended for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Louisville (7-6) finished with its worst record in Smith's five
years. The team was 11-2 last year and Smith is 41-21 at Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   Leftwich's 249-yard passing performance was special because it
came in his last game -- and practically on one leg.</TE>
<TE>   Already slowed because of a sore shin injured in early November,
he took several hits in the first quarter and hobbled to the huddle.</TE>
<TE>   "On one leg he's better than anybody else in the country," Coach
Bob Pruett said.</TE>
<TE>   X-rays taken on the leg at halftime were negative.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got hit in the leg I couldn't step with my plant foot. So
I was just trying to do what I could do just to get the ball in the
receivers' hands," Leftwich said.</TE>
<TE>   In last year's GMAC Bowl, the Thundering Herd rallied from a
30-point deficit to defeat East Carolina, 64-61, in double-overtime
behind Leftwich's 576 passing yards.</TE>

<HD>Conquistador Cielo Is Euthanized at 23</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conquistador Cielo, voted horse of the year in 1982 after winning the
1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes five days after his victory in the
Metropolitan Mile, was euthanized Tuesday at Claiborne Farm in Paris,
Ky., after a hoof disease caused him to founder in his left foreleg.</LD>
<LD>   Conquistador Cielo, who was 23, had a brief but spectacular
13-race career that was compromised by shin injuries.</LD>
<LD>   He missed the first two Triple Crown races, the Kentucky Derby and
the Preakness, but over a sloppy track won the Belmont by 14 lengths.</LD>
<TE>   His bold trainer, Woody Stephens, brought Conquistador Cielo back
in a week that had started with a 7 1/4-length win over older horses
in the Metropolitan.</TE>
<TE>   Conquistador Cielo, who won the Metropolitan in 1:33, setting a
Belmont Park record, was the first of Stephens' unprecedented five
straight victories in the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   Conquistador Cielo, owned by Henryk de Kwiatkowski, ran only three
times after the Belmont, his career ending with a third-place finish
in the Travers.</TE>
<TE>   The colt was syndicated by De Kwiatkowski, who retained 10 of the
40 breeding shares, for a book value of $36.4 million, which was a
record at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Conquistador Cielo was not a preeminent sire, but his progeny --
almost 800 foals -- earned more than $55 million.</TE>
<TE>   The chief earner was Marquetry, winner of the 1991 Hollywood Gold
Cup, whose purses totaled $2.8 million.</TE>

<HD>Matias Fends Off Upset in City Singles Final</HD>

<LD>The short, sliced forehand return that Carson High senior Dianne
Matias put away on match point in the third-set tiebreaker of the
City Section girls' tennis individual tournament ended the last of
many lengthy rallies Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The most impressive of them all, though, was the one nearly pulled
off by Granada Hills junior Christine Dao.</LD>
<LD>   The third-seeded Dao made a strong bid for her second upset
victory in two days before the top-seeded Matias prevailed, 6-2, 2-6,
7-6 (5), in the singles championship match at Balboa Sports Complex
in Encino.</LD>
<TE>   "I pulled it out," Matias said. "It was a really good match. After
I won the first set, I think I got a little tired in the second, and
I kind of relaxed a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   That's not a good idea against Dao.</TE>
<TE>   She seemed to get stronger and more confident as the match wore
on. Except for the final result, Wednesday's match was a carbon copy
of Tuesday's semifinal, in which Dao lost the first set but came back
to upset second-seeded Judith De Vera, another Carson senior, who
began the tournament as the defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel kind of disappointed and happy at the same time," Dao
said. "I'm happy that I got that far, and I think I played very well.
But to come so close and not win is a little disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Matias won the first set handily, relying heavily on a deceptive
sliced backhand to convert breaks in the third and seventh games.</TE>
<TE>   The roles were reversed in the second set as Dao began to match
Matias stroke for stroke in well-played rallies. Dao took command
with a 4-1 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Matias broke Dao in the third game of the third set and held the
next game for a 3-1 lead, which didn't last. Dao tied the score when
she broke Matias' serve in the eighth game.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Palisades team of seniors Madison Sellers and
Jasmine Reed defeated Granada Hills' Tracey Takeshita and Maria
Cardenas, 6-4, 6-0, to win the doubles championship.</TE>

<HD>Tangtiphaiboontana Shows Perseverance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana became known during this golf season as "the
girl with the long last name," but it turns out she is a lot more.</LD>
<LD>   She proved during the high school season to be a fighter with
incredible mental toughness and a talented player with a bright
future.</LD>
<LD>   A senior at Long Beach Wilson, Tangtiphaiboontana has battled
through the personal tragedy of both her parents being killed in a
car accident in November 2001, and though she deals daily with
emotions most can't comprehend, she has persevered and succeeded in
one of the most mentally demanding sports.</LD>
<TE>   She shot two-under-par 70, beating 131 golfers to win the Southern
Section individual title. She shot 75 and tied for fifth in Southern
California in the CIF-WSCGA. The Moore League champion for the third
consecutive year, Tangtiphaiboontana was medalist in 10 of Wilson's
14 matches, broke par seven times and finished two over par for the
season.</TE>
<TE>   She is The Times' girls' golfer of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty happy with this season," said Tangtiphaiboontana, who
has committed to Stanford. "I'm really happy with the individual
part; I just wish the team had done a little better."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins began the Southern Section finals as favorites after an
undefeated regular season and a victory at the Central Divisional
qualifier. They shot 452 in the finals -- about 30 strokes higher
than their season average -- and finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Tangtiphaiboontana's sad story was the talk of the junior golf
circuit when she finished second at the U.S. Girls Championship in
August, but the happy ending to her high school golf season was among
the most popular victories this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very happy for her," said Amie Cochran, the West Torrance
player who finished runner-up in the section individual finals for
the third consecutive year. "Even though she beat me, I was happy
that she went all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Tangtiphaiboontana said it was her biggest victory. The
second-place finish at the U.S. Girls Championship may have been more
prestigious, but it was still second place.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never won a tournament where there was that big of a field,"
she said. "It definitely ranks up there."</TE>
<TE>   She almost didn't play. Tangtiphaiboontana, ranked No. 1 in her
class with a 4.20 grade-point average, said she considered skipping
the section individual championships because she had missed too much
school.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson Coach Jim Ferguson wasn't surprised she played, or that she
played well.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing she does surprises me," Ferguson said. "She is at her
best when the stakes are the highest and she seems to thrive under
pressure situations. I've never seen her succumb to pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Her pinpoint accuracy and impeccable short game help make up for
her slight lack of distance off the tee, but tenacity and inner drive
are her strongest traits.</TE>
<TE>   "People are surprised," Ferguson said. "They see this sweet,
demure, cute, quiet little thing, but uh-uh.... She is one of the
most competitive people I know. She does not like to lose."</TE>

<LD>Five teams from the preseason top 10, including then-No. 2 Quartz
Hill, lost at least two games and tied another during the first two
weeks of play. Santa Margarita is ranked No. 1 after outscoring
opponents, 19-1, in its first four games. Temecula Chaparral, which
won in a shootout over Santa Ana Mater Dei to win the championship of
the Rancho Cucamonga tournament on Dec. 9, is the highest-ranked
newcomer. Riverside Poly lost to Chaparral in a semifinal of the
Rancho Cucamonga tournament, but upset host Irvine Woodbridge, 1-0,
in a nonleague game last Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   John Ortega</LD>
<LD>   Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley, which entered the season at No.
5, moves into the top spot after winning the Santa Ana Mater Dei
tournament. The Cougars are No. 1 despite a loss to Los Alamitos
because preseason No. 1 Santa Margarita lost to Los Alamitos and
Irvine Northwood in the Trabuco Hills tournament. Los Alamitos jumps
to No. 4 after reaching the tournament final. Huntington Beach Edison
rises to No. 5 with a victory over preseason No. 2 San Clemente. Dana
Point Dana Hills jumps into the rankings at No. 9 after shutting out
Irvine Woodbridge.</LD>

<TE>   Santa Ana Calvary Chapel finished a disappointing sixth at the
Clovis Shootout, but considering the tournament featured six of the
top 15 teams in the state and was the first action of the season for
the Eagles, a little rust was to be expected. Look for Calvary Chapel
to rebound at the prestigious Reno Tournament of Champions this
weekend. Second-ranked Santa Ana solidified its spot as one of the
top teams in the Southland with a dominant performance at the
Huntington Beach Edison tournament. The Saints won the team title by
141 points over Laguna Hills. Orange El Modena moves up to No. 7
after finishing runner-up to defending state champion Bakersfield at
the East Bakersfield tournament.</TE>

<LD>Given the way Underpinning performed in his debut Nov. 27 at
Hollywood Park, owner Richard Giacopelli and trainer Patrick Biancone
were fortunate the gelding wasn't claimed for $40,000.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there probably wasn't too much concern about that
because the son of Boston Harbor, a former Breeders' Cup Juvenile
winner, had less-than-spectacular workouts before the race.</LD>
<LD>   Breaking from the outside in the field of nine, Underpinning was
bet down to 7-1 from a morning line of 20-1 off these workouts: a 50
2/5 breezing drill from the gate at Saratoga on Oct. 4, a 1:03
breezing drill on the turf at the same track five days later and a 50
flat half-mile move Nov. 20 at Santa Anita.</LD>
<TE>   Ridden by Tony Farina, Underpinning promptly broke his maiden by
eight lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Underpinning is the 5-2 favorite on Russ Hudak's morning line in
today's sixth, a $26,000 starter allowance at 1 1/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Oh Take, who finished first or second in nine of
12 in Argentina, makes his U.S. debut for owner Nelson Bunker Hunt
and trainer Ron McAnally in today's seventh at Hollywood Park. The
one-mile turf race also attracted Long Gone Con, Adminniestrator and

<HD>Johnson's 'Passion' Wins Him Franchise</HD>
<DH>Founder of Black Entertainment Television has exactly what
NBA wants for its new team in Charlotte.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Business know-how, a passion for basketball and a commitment to
Charlotte. Robert Johnson had exactly what the NBA wanted, and now
the billionaire is on his way to becoming the first black majority
owner in major pro sports.</LD>
<LD>   The league officially announced Wednesday that Johnson was its
choice to buy the NBA's newest expansion team, selecting him over a
group that included Larry Bird.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't be competitive anywhere in this world if you ignore
good, quality talent," Johnson said. "That decision was made some 50
years ago when Branch Rickey brought Jackie Robinson into baseball."</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, 56, is the billionaire founder of Black Entertainment
Television.</TE>
<TE>   Pending approval of the 29 NBA owners, he will pay $300 million to
become the owner of the league's 30th team, which will begin play in
the 2004-05 season.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Johnson deserved to get this franchise based on who he is,
not what he is," Phoenix Sun owner Jerry Colangelo said when Johnson
was introduced as the man who will bring the NBA back to North
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The new team, not yet nicknamed, will replace the Hornets, who
left Charlotte for New Orleans last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, a self-described optimist and opportunist, was chosen
instead of a group headed by Boston businessman Steve Belkin that
included Bird and former Celtic executives M.L. Carr and Jan Volk.</TE>
<TE>   Both prospective ownership groups made presentations to the
expansion committee on Monday, and Johnson won it over.</TE>
<TE>   "When he appeared before the committee, his passion was felt by
the people sitting around that table," Colangelo said. "They felt
that here was a man who has been very successful, that he has a
passion for this game, and he shows a willingness and a commitment to
make this thing go.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he's an African American was a plus, it was a
byproduct, but he was not awarded this franchise because of that."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson sat alongside Colangelo, NBA Commissioner David Stern,
Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik and Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory
during a news conference at the NBA Store.</TE>
<TE>   Granik said the league would look into realignment in the near
future and that Charlotte might have to play in the Western
Conference for a season or two.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who also takes over management of the WNBA's Charlotte
Sting, said he would soon begin putting together a management team.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would consider hiring Bird, Johnson gave a one-word
answer: "No."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Mississippi and educated at Illinois and Princeton,
Johnson spoke about what the selection meant to him and minorities
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm obviously very proud of what African Americans have
accomplished since they've been in this country," he said. "To say
[it has been] under difficult conditions would be an understatement,
but through all of that 200-plus-year history we have always achieved
by trying to be the best despite the odds."</TE>
<TE>   The co-owners who moved the Hornets, George Shinn and Ray
Wooldridge, fell out of favor with the people of Charlotte over
numerous issues.</TE>
<TE>   Their team, which led the NBA in attendance for several seasons in
the late 1980s and early '90s, played in front of small crowds last
season when it became apparent the Hornets would be moving.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson will be the man at the forefront of trying to repair the
relationship between the city's basketball fans and its newest sports
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, the race issue dissipates for most people," he
said. "I don't care what color you are, if you put a lousy team on
the court, you can be in a town with 100% black population and you'll
never get anybody at the game."</TE>

<HD>Leiweke: Kings Are on Thin Ice</HD>
<DH>Team president says financial losses may force Anschutz to
sell unless union agreement changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King President Tim Leiweke, refuting a Forbes magazine report that
pegged the club's operating income for last season at a $7-million
profit, said the Kings have never made money since Denver billionaire
Philip Anschutz assumed ownership and, in fact, have swallowed more
than $103 million.</LD>
<LD>   They will continue hemorrhaging money, Leiweke said, unless the
NHL and the players' union dramatically revamp their collective
bargaining agreement, which expires in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   "To hear anyone, players or union, saying that we don't have a
problem here, they are blindfolded and they're going to kill the
sport," Leiweke said. "We have a major problem. We have to fix this
because I'm telling you, we will not continue. We won't. We either
fix it or we're out.</LD>
<TE>   "If someone came to us and said they will extend the current CBA
for another five years, we'd turn around and sell the team. We can't
continue to do this. This is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   In a highly unusual move, Leiweke and Dan Beckerman, chief
financial officer of Anschutz Entertainment Group -- which owns the
Kings and Staples Center -- showed The Times the Kings' historical
cash basis income statements from 1996-97 through last season, an
audited statement for last year, and this year's budget. Those
figures did not include debt service and deferred compensation to
players, which peaked at $30.6 million in the 1998-99 season.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, once saddled with deferred payments to about 40
players, are still paying about a dozen long-departed players such as
Wayne Gretzky, Rob Blake, Kelly Hrudey, Dave Taylor, Marty McSorley
and Pat Conacher, a residue of the party-now, pay-later Bruce McNall
regime.</TE>
<TE>   While the figures showed the Kings have enjoyed strong revenue
growth since Anschutz took over, built Staples Center and moved them
into the $400-million building, their payroll and other expenses have
soared. Leiweke said the Kings get 25% of the suite and premier seat
revenue at Staples, as well as 50% of the concession and parking
revenue during their games.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said the Kings are spending 86% of every new dollar on
salaries, "and if that's the case, you've got a major issue with the
economics."</TE>
<TE>   Sources confirmed the Kings were among four clubs that provided
financial data to the NHL Players' Assn. two years ago to back the
league's contention changes in the economic system are essential to
the survival of many of its members.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL, alone among the four major professional sports leagues,
does not have a salary cap or luxury tax; Commissioner Gary Bettman
has repeatedly declared a need for cost containment, but the NHLPA
has maintained the fault, if any, lies in clubs' management of the
system, not the system itself.</TE>
<TE>   NHLPA Executive Director Bob Goodenow was traveling Wednesday and
unavailable for comment. Spokesman Jonathon Weatherdon declined to
comment on Leiweke's views of NHL economics.</TE>
<TE>   "Forbes magazine is a highly regarded publication," Weatherdon
said. "If the Los Angeles Kings have an issue with the numbers
published by Forbes, I'm sure they will take it up with Forbes
directly."</TE>
<TE>   According to their statements for 1996-97, Anschutz's first full
season as owner, the Kings' revenues were about $30.5 million and
their operating expenses were slightly less than $38 million, a loss
of about $7.3 million. "I thought that was an absolute disaster,"
Leiweke said. "What you'll see is it got worse."</TE>
<TE>   Their losses hit $20.5 million in 1998-99 but shrank to about $5.9
million in 1999-2000, their first season at Staples. Their best
season was 2000-01 when they lost $3.7 million after a run to the
second round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, with revenues of $62 million and operating expenses
of $70.1 million, the Kings lost $8.8 million but whittled that to
$6.5 million after playoff revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said the club has budgeted a $5-million loss EBIDA
(earnings before income tax, depreciation, amortization) this season
but that could total $10.5 million including deferred compensation
and interest payment even if they play one playoff round.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea where [Forbes] came up with that $7 million,
because it's beyond me," Leiweke said. "They're completely guessing,
so it's a blind guess."</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Badenhausen, statistics senior editor for Forbes, said no NHL
club "lays out their income statement for us," but valuations are
calculated by phoning clubs for information and looking at revenues
and expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes listed the Detroit Red Wings as the NHL's most valuable
team, at $266 million, but with a $3.4-million operating loss last
season. The Kings ranked ninth in value, at $205 million.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz and partner Ed Roski Jr., bought the Kings in late 1995
for $113.25 million. They also own one-third of the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're comfortable in what we come up with," Badenhausen said.
"The Kings are a very complicated structure, with Staples Center and
a three-team building, and in the sports business, a big part of it
is depreciation and amortization. If you looked at the net income
level as opposed to the operating level, which we do, the losses
would be much more significant. The Kings have a lot of debt to pay
off."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the Kings can camouflage revenues by attributing them
to other Anschutz enterprises, such as Staples Center. Leiweke denied
having done that.</TE>
<TE>   "As a private company, you don't want to show a profit because
then you're going to have to pay taxes," Badenhausen said. "The Kings
have a complicated situation because they have a lot of money that
goes to the company that operates the arena. How you assign revenues
that go to that company, the Kings or the Lakers is up to their
discretion. If all the revenues go to the arena company, then they
can say the Kings lost money.</TE>
<TE>   "Of the four sports, hockey is in the most perilous position. At
the same time, the Kings certainly have to be looked at as one of the
upper-tier franchises in terms of stability.... Accounting can be
manipulated in all sorts of ways."</TE>
<TE>   Bettman declined to comment on the Kings' situation but said
Leiweke's comments "underscore why we as a league have the commitment
we do to ensure there will be a new economic system. Phil Anschutz
wants a new economic system, and we're confident we're going to have
one.... We know what our economic condition is and the union knows
what our economic condition is and we know there has to be a
fundamental change. Anyone who says revenues are being siphoned off
or funneled somewhere is being ostrich-like or disingenuous."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said he's not trying to win pity or fire a salvo at the
NHLPA.</TE>
<TE>   "What discourages me is when I see players talking about a
battle," he said. "It shouldn't be a battle because guess what? If
it's a battle, then kiss the league goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   He said he wants fans to understand Anschutz isn't raising ticket
prices and avoiding the free-agent market to pull more money out of
the Kings. He said the Kings, whose player budget this year is $52.2
million -- including other team expenses that had been slotted into
other areas -- committed significant amounts of money to Jason
Allison, Mattias Norstrom and others while keeping their ticket
prices in the bottom half of the league.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, and this is Phil as well, I love this sport and it's
a great sport. I believe it's the best in-person, live sport there is
out there, and I love this league," Leiweke said. "I am very hopeful
logic will prevail and we will come together and solve this. I have
great faith in Gary. More than faith -- prayers."</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>If the Lakers are lucky, maybe they will be able to smell the
champagne, mopped dry going on six months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal rubbed sticky spray from his eyes. Kobe Bryant,
all boyish, smiled and laughed. Rick Fox carried a basketball -- the
one he promised to get a year before -- and a Bahamian flag.</LD>
<LD>   They'll play again tonight at Continental Airlines Arena, for the
first time since they clinched their three-peat in June, back when it
looked like their time would never end.</LD>
<TE>   They will look, if they care to, at teammates who were with them
then. Champions then, not the anvils they seem to have become: Robert
Horry, Derek Fisher, Devean George, Samaki Walker and Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers awoke this morning with a record of 10-16, looking
nothing like the burgeoning dynasty many predicted, looking
unmotivated and unschooled, old in some places, tattered in others.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they are unwilling or unable no longer matters. Almost a
third of the season is gone, and O'Neal is so angry he won't speak
publicly. Bryant is playing a passive game out of his character,
seemingly lacking something.</TE>
<TE>   This, perhaps, is how a team disintegrates, its edges having grown
stale or aged. In El Segundo, General Manager Mitch Kupchak searches
for new talent, for a trade that might kill the complacency that came
hard on the heels of the championships, shopping George and veterans
Fisher and Horry and Fox, willing to listen on any player but the
superstars.</TE>
<TE>   In the Nets' practice facility Wednesday afternoon, Brian Shaw
said, "Nobody wants anybody in the organization to panic, but I'm
sure it's getting close to panic time. We don't have anyone to blame
but ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, they've had seven weeks to give the slightest hint they
would contend for another title, and all they've done is hang their
shoulders, run to the trainers' room and lose basketball games.
O'Neal's absence put strain all over the roster, and some in the
organization believe that Horry's play, in particular, has suffered.
He's not built for 35 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Laker management has no choice but to consider alternatives,
despite what many consider to be immovable personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to talk about it," Coach Phil Jackson said. "It puts
people in tenuous positions. [But] that's basically what we're about
here, is production."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Byron Scott played in 183 playoff games, including 56 in one
three-year stretch with the Lakers. The following season, in 1988-89,
he had one of his most productive years.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday afternoon, he grinned at suggestions a cumulative effect
of playoff games has grounded these Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought about that," Scott said. "I don't think Earvin
[Johnson] ever thought about that. I don't think we thought about
that until our careers were over, then we started to think about
that.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what guys, you can put down 10 different things for why
they're not playing real well right now. Complacency. Overconfidence.
Not in shape. You could write a list of things if you wanted to. I
have no idea. I'm on the outside looking in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had a sore throat and appeared sluggish Wednesday. He was
expected to play tonight but canceled a scheduled appearance on "The
Late Show With David Letterman." ... Net forward Richard Jefferson,
on the Lakers: "There's nothing dead about that dog at all. It might
be wounded, but it's not dead."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Lakers swept the Nets in the 2002 NBA Finals,
confirming the assumed gap in talent and playoff mettle. In 22
regular-season games against the Nets, O'Neal has averaged 27.9
points and 13.1 rebounds. Jason Kidd, in 25 games against the Lakers,
averaged 12.9 points, 9.3 assists and 6.2 rebounds, but has lost 19
of the games.</TE>

<LD>There was more to Paul Jones' weekend than a victory with
Whosleavingwho in the $500,000 Champion of Champions on Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Less than 24 hours later, Los Alamitos' leading trainer scored a
record-setting victory with Agouti in the $163,450 Southern
California Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Jones' second Grade I victory in as many nights was his 164th win
of the meet overall, breaking his record of 163 in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Owned and bred by longtime Jones client Joe Bettencourt, Agouti
beat favored Harley Man in the Derby. Ridden by Ramon Sanchez, the
3-year-old Corona Cartel gelding completed the 400 yards in 19.40
seconds, which is 0.06 of a second off the track record established
by Takin On The Cash more than 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   This was the sixth victory in 20 starts for Agouti, who paid $7.80
as the 5-2 second choice in the field of 10.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Fuddy Buddy. 2. A Tiny Bit More. 3. Ashlander. 4.
Call Him Quick. 5. Legal Thief. 6. Momma Is A Moviestar. 7. Pastures
New. 8. Jazzing High Five.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Fuddy Buddy in the first, use A Tiny Bit More,
Princess Of The Moon and Border Law in the second, Ashlander and
Master Cowboy Jazz in the third and the Brian Dasher-Masculinity
entry, Corona Chaser and Call Him Quick, in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Miss Snazzy Cash drops a notch in the sixth,
which is the fourth leg of a pick six with a carry-over of $32,018.
Adams County could improve second time out for trainer Chris O'Dell
in the eighth.</TE>

<HD>Iverson's 41 Points Give 76ers a Boost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson scored a season-high 41 points, reaching the 40-point
plateau for the 51st time, to lead the Philadelphia 76ers over the
Minnesota Timberwolves, 99-94, Wednesday night at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Garnett had 24 points and 16 rebounds for the Timberwolves,
who had won three of four, including a 16-point victory over the
three-time defending champion Lakers on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew they'd have a lot of confidence after beating the Lakers
handily," Iverson said. "It doesn't matter that the Lakers are
struggling. They're still the Lakers. We wanted to jump on
[Minnesota] early."</LD>
<TE>   Iverson made 10 of his first 15 shots and scored 26 points in the
first half to help the 76ers build a 19-point lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   He finished 14 for 29 from the field and made 11 of 16 free
throws.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 95, Indiana 83 -- Yao Ming had 29 points, 10 rebounds and
six blocked shots to overcome 27 points by Jermaine O'Neal and lead
the Rockets at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Yao was held scoreless by Indiana in his NBA debut, the Rockets'
season opener.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 118, Memphis 100 -- Michael Jordan took over early,
scoring 18 of his season-high 33 points in the first quarter at
Washington and helping the Wizards win their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan made 14 of 23 shots, including eight of 11 in the first
quarter, to hit a season high in points for the second time in as
many games.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 91, Boston 81 -- Eddie Jones scored 21 points to lead Miami
to its third road victory in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Miami held Boston to only three baskets over a span of 17 minutes
51 seconds -- from the first quarter until the opening minute of the
third.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 111, Cleveland 106 -- Chauncey Billups scored eight
consecutive points in overtime and finished with 23 to lift the
Pistons at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Billups made a three-point basket to put Detroit ahead to stay,
106-103.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons extended their winning streak to five games.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 97, Utah 90 -- Pat Garrity scored 24 points at Salt Lake
City and the Magic ended a two-game losing streak despite playing
without forward Grant Hill, who dressed but sat out to rest his
surgically repaired ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 80, Denver 75 -- Michael Finley scored 31 points at Denver
and the Mavericks handed the undermanned Nuggets, who dressed 10
players, their sixth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas defeated the Nuggets for the fifth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 91, Seattle 88 -- Tony Parker scored 22 points and Tim
Duncan barely missed a triple-double with 18 points, 15 rebounds and
eight assists for the Spurs, who ended a four-game road losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 96, Toronto 83 -- Jalen Rose scored 20 points at Chicago
to lead the Bulls, who have won five of their last six games and who
ended a 16-game losing streak to Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 111, New Orleans 106 -- Antawn Jamison had 35 points
and 13 rebounds for the host Warriors, who kept their poise in a
tense fourth quarter in which they never led by more than five
points.</TE>

<LD>Miami Coach Pat Riley was fined $50,000 by the NBA on Wednesday for
saying game officials are being unfair to the Heat because of a
"dislike of me over the years."</LD>
<LD>   Riley made the comments after a 97-92 loss to New York on Friday,
in which the Knicks shot 37 free throws to the Heat's 16.</LD>

<TE>   Sacramento King point guard Mike Bibby said he expected to play
tonight against the visiting San Antonio Spurs, but Coach Rick
Adelman said it could be a game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver, Houston and Philadelphia agreed to a trade that sends
swingman James Posey, 25, from the Nuggets to the Rockets, forward
Kenny Thomas, 25, from the Rockets to the 76ers and forwards Mark
Bryant, 37, and Art Long, 29, from the 76ers to the Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Denver also gets a future first-round draft choice from
Philadelphia and a second-round pick from the Rockets.</TE>

<TE>   A judge denied former NBA player Jayson Williams' motion in
Flemington, N.J., to dismiss charges he faces in the shooting death
of a limousine driver.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Edward Coleman conceded Wednesday that some
errors were made in presenting the case to the grand jury but that
they were not sufficient to warrant dismissal of the charges. Defense
lawyers said they would appeal Coleman's ruling.</TE>

<KH>LAKERS AT NEW JERSEY</KH>
<HD>Off, Off, Off Broadway</HD>
<DH>Finals berth didn't change fact that Jason Kidd and Nets
are still second fiddle to lowly Knicks in the NBA's biggest market</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>From the swamp they came and to the swamp they always return.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for the New Jersey Nets, while this might not turn
out to be true figuratively, because they have overcome their
wretched tradition to become a power in the NBA's Eastern Conference
-- and the only one in their metropolitan area -- it is true,
literally.</LD>
<LD>   Their arena, named appropriately after a low-end airline, sits
amid the marsh grass of an otherwise thinly developed tract of
northern New Jersey, near the Jersey Turnpike, if nothing else.</LD>
<TE>   There are no towns nearby, or malls, or festivities of any kind.
Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban, asked what he thought on his first
visit, said they should at least turn on the lights outside to get
away from that forlorn, middle-of-nowhere feeling.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL's New York Giants and Jets fill the adjacent football
stadium on Sundays, but on weeknights, even high-level NBA ball is a
hard sell, with Jason Kidd and his athletic teammates often
performing their high-rising feats before half-empty houses.</TE>
<TE>   When Kidd arrived last season to turn the Nets around, on the
court, at least, he knew little about the area. Told the New York
Knicks had always owned the market, he replied brashly:</TE>
<TE>   "That won't last long."</TE>
<TE>   No longer than forever. These days, Kidd is more cautious about
forecasting marketing trends. Because he'll be a free agent next
summer, and the Nets are having problems integrating their new hopes,
Dikembe Mutombo, Rodney Rogers and Chris Childs, team officials have
no shortage of worries.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd is actually soft-spoken for an NBA star, masking the
cockiness that's so evident on the floor, saying they're building
something, etc., declining to speculate on his situation. Otherwise,
Net officials might be sending out their own resumes by now.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the question never goes away: What are Jason and
Joumana Kidd, both from the Bay Area, really thinking when they look
at all those empty seats?</TE>
<TE>   It can't be good.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets claim an average of 13,000, although insiders think the
real number is closer to 10,000. In any case, they're still second
fiddle, and might be third if there was another team in Madison
Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the Knicks' present moribund/hopeless stage, with their
nine-year sellout streak over, they're still drawing an average of
18,766 fans, who regard the Garden as a shrine.</TE>
<TE>   Humbled in every other way, the Knicks missed the NBA playoffs for
the first time since 1987, finished 22 games behind the Nets and were
swept in the season series -- by 18 points a game -- but still aren't
shy about reminding the Nets who is who:</TE>
<TE>   As Latrell Sprewell put it bluntly, before Tuesday's first meeting
of the season:</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what they say, we play in the Garden."</TE>
<TE>   If the Nets didn't understand the implications, the august New
York Times, based 10 blocks up 7th Avenue from the Garden, made it
clear in a headline:</TE>
<TE>   "Nets Will Always Be the Guys From Jersey."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, a lot of Manhattan sportswriters, who keep reminding
the Nets of their low estate, are guys and gals from Jersey too, such
as the New York Daily News' Mitch Lawrence, who lives in Essex Fells.</TE>
<TE>   Not that that changes anything.</TE>
<TE>   "People where I live don't say anything about the Nets," Lawrence
says. "They just want to know how the Knicks are going to get better.
And, 'Can the Knicks get Jason Kidd?' And, 'He is leaving, right?' "</TE>
<TE>   No, $50 million over the salary cap, the Knicks have no chance to
get Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows if Jason will leave, but he turned down a
$100-million extension last summer and refuses to commit himself,
leaving the organization jumpy -- reporters are often asked not to
bother Kidd with questions about it -- and all the skeptics
surrounding them predicting the worst.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the downtown writers do appreciate the Nets. However,
with the fans, the way it was is the way it remains.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times' Mike Wise recently wrote a column, telling the
fans to "embrace the Nets," and was kidded about it by peers, who
came up and embraced him.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy to change an entire culture and some cultures, more
than others.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in the Wilds of Jersey</TE>
<TE>   Of course, before last season, when General Manager Rod Thorn
landed Kidd for Stephon Marbury in the bargain of the new century,
New Yorkers barely knew the Nets existed, or cared.</TE>
<TE>   With Kidd, it was a new deal. The Nets started the 2001-02 season
38-17 and never looked back, until the Lakers and Shaquille O'Neal
flattened them in the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   So the Nets went looking for a Shaq-stopper, or, at least, a Vlade
Divac-stopper.</TE>
<TE>   "Our feeling at the end of last year was, there were five or six
teams, counting both conferences, that we would have a hard time
beating," Thorn says.</TE>
<TE>   "Indiana, we beat by the skin of our teeth to get into the second
round. Charlotte didn't have [Jamal] Mashburn, when we played them
[in the second round]. And, obviously, nobody can deal with Shaq....</TE>
<TE>   "Our feeling was, we needed to get better defensively around the
basket. The teams that we thought were equal to us or better, either
had a four [power forward] or a five [center] who we were
hard-pressed to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   In what looked like another slick deal, Thorn unloaded his
oft-criticized $11-million-a-year forward, Keith Van Horn, on the
Philadelphia 76ers for Mutombo, who was 36 and under contract for
three more seasons at $53 million but was still a defensive presence.</TE>
<TE>   In other moves that seemed like good ideas at the time, the Nets
signed Rogers and Childs.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers turned up heavy, as usual. Childs was so overweight, they
suspended him and sent him to a fat farm. Mutombo was a problem for
the offense, which he learned slowly and messed up with his bad
hands; he was averaging only 25 minutes a game, before breaking his
right wrist and leaving until springtime.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jefferson, promoted to the starting lineup, has looked
young and inconsistent, not quite the 18-point-a-night scorer they
hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon Martin, who looked as though he was set to bust out when he
scored 26 and 35 points in the final games of the Finals, is back to
only 13 shots a night again.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Van Horn has revived his career in Philadelphia, averaging
16 points and eight rebounds. As the Nets' fellow finalists, the
Lakers, have been learning daily, it's a whole new season.</TE>
<TE>   With a real run in the Finals, the Nets might have begun carving
out a new niche for themselves, but that was a lot to ask. Off to a
solid 16-9 start this season under third-year Coach Byron Scott,
they're back to trying to build a following the hard way,
incrementally, which requires excellence over a long period of time
and, in their case, against great odds.</TE>
<TE>   Their problem is that excellence isn't the issue here, as much as
accessibility.</TE>
<TE>   The normal human impulse for Manhattan residents -- all 1.5
million of them, packed with media biggies, CEOs and other opinion
leaders -- to switch to a winner, is checked by the perception of the
Meadowlands as not merely an inhospitable place that is hard to get
to, but an outpost on another world.</TE>
<TE>   With a parking space in a garage going for $400 a month and up,
most people in Manhattan don't own cars. With parking going for $20
at Knick games, and few spaces available, most fans at Knick games
come by subway, train and bus to the arena, which was built, in a
stroke of genius, atop Penn Station.</TE>
<TE>   So the Knicks have a following in New Jersey, but the Nets can't
draw from Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the Nets' media situation, also problematic.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan is now being fought over by two sets of media
conglomerates and their allies.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand is Madison Square Garden, owned by Cablevision, the
cable company that has Manhattan locked up, and the Garden's MSG
cable networks, which show the Knicks, Rangers and Mets.</TE>
<TE>   On the other is Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, who took his
team off MSG, formed his own cable company, Yankee Entertainment
Sports, and went into partnership with the Nets and Devils.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, while the sides fight it out in court, is that YES
can't get on cable TV in Manhattan, which means that the Yankees, who
are in the midst of another of their dynasties, can't be seen by
millions of their fans.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, the crowd-pleasing Nets, who need the
exposure, aren't shown in Manhattan, either.</TE>
<TE>   And the Nets' arena project, for a $350-million building in
downtown Newark (accessible by train) is stalled. Negotiations with
state officials are going nowhere, with New Jersey, which is being
asked to put up $190 million, projecting a $5-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, they'd better get used to that swamp, because it
looks as though they'll be in it for a while longer.</TE>
<TE>   California Kidds, Jersey Address</TE>
<TE>   Just the other day, Sun assistant coach Robin Pound laughed when
Joumana said she genuinely liked living in N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "Save that for the media," Pound said. "You're West Coast people."</TE>
<TE>   ESPN Magazine</TE>
<TE>   January 2001</TE>
<TE>   No, seriously, Joumana says she really likes it here.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're with your family and people you love, you kind of
make the most out of any place that you are," she says, waiting with
her NBA Entertainment crew (she is also on "Extra!") outside the
Nets' dressing room after Tuesday's loss to the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   "But it sort of adds to it that we're in New York and it's
beautiful. We live 20 minutes away and we can get into the city so
fast. Yet we're in a nice suburb-type area that is nice and quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Joumana Kidd isn't your typical wife in the background. She and
Jason have been through a very public domestic-disturbance situation
in Phoenix, and they're in this together for the long haul.</TE>
<TE>   Does that part about "kind of make the best of any place that you
are" sound like this isn't her dream location?</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, how can it be, not knowing what you want --
because they don't know which teams will actually bid when July 1
comes -- and having everything you say examined for its hidden
meaning?</TE>
<TE>   That's where the Kidds are, in a mansion in leafy Upper Saddle
River, and limbo, all at once.</TE>
<TE>   All sort of opportunities may present themselves ... and may not.</TE>
<TE>   Jason loves the idea of playing in San Antonio with his friend Tim
Duncan. When the Spurs were in recently, Kidd talked animatedly about
the possibility, as did Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   However, San Antonio insiders say the Spurs' Plan A is for rookie
Manu Ginobili to establish himself, and Tony Parker to solidify his
hold on the point guard position, so they can try to replace the
retiring David Robinson with Clipper free agent Michael Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   However, to date, Ginobili has been slowed by an ankle injury,
leaving the situation fluid.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Seattle, where owner Howard Schultz, the Starbucks
magnate, courted Kidd personally and didn't extend Gary Payton's
contract, leaving himself the flexibility to pursue Jason.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, why should Kidd take Payton's place and butt
his head against all those West superpowers, the Lakers, Kings and
Mavericks?</TE>
<TE>   Kidd could find himself in the same position Chris Webber did in
Sacramento in the summer of 2001, yearning to go somewhere he liked
better but unable to find a basketball situation as good as the one
he had.</TE>
<TE>   The one the Kidds are in needs a lot of work. Of course, they have
already put in a lot of work.</TE>
<TE>   Used to player-friendly organizations like their last one in
Phoenix, Joumana was dismayed to find that Net wives had no parking
reserved for them, among various other non-thoughtful touches.
Whenever she complained, she was told it came from Lou Lamoriello,
the crusty Devil general manager, who had just been put in overall
charge of the new YankeeNets operation.</TE>
<TE>   So she invited Lamoriello to a lunch, which lasted four hours,
bringing a neatly printed list titled, positively and assertively,
"Room for Opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   She asked for better parking and better promotion for Jason,
another novelty for Lamoriello, who preached a team-first concept and
didn't play up to his stars or the media.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Nets were already opening eyes, and Jason, as well as
Joumana, had made it clear that the status quo wouldn't do, the man
nicknamed "Tal-Lou-Ban" by the local press corps turned marshmallow
and said yes to everything.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's a start, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   It could all work out, really.</TE>
<TE>   If the Nets stay up there, attendance should pick up, as it did
last season, when they had drawn 3,000 fewer people per game at this
point.</TE>
<TE>   But then, there's so much to see between now and summer, isn't
there?</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually funny more than anything," Joumana says. "We know
that we have as much of an idea where we're going to be as anyone
else does. It's almost funny when people keep asking and asking. I
wish I knew....</TE>
<TE>   "Teams can't talk to you yet, you know what I mean? So you have no
idea and in this business -- I would have never thought we'd get
traded, so you never know. Anything could happen....</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think about it, just kind of take it day by day,
enjoy the moment, I live for today. People come around and see my
house and see my new mural and they'll go, 'Oh, guess you're
staying.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's like, no, but I don't make those [decorator] decisions based
on that."</TE>
<TE>   The moment is all you really have, isn't it? At least, until July
1.</TE>

<LD>Olympic downhill gold medalist Bill Johnson, who suffered a severe
brain injury during an attempted comeback nearly two years ago, broke
his left hip in a skiing accident over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   He was in fair condition Wednesday, said a nursing supervisor at
St. Anthony's Central Hospital in Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, 43, fell while skiing on an intermediate run at
Breckenridge, Colo. He was at the resort participating in the
Hartford Ski Spectacular.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson won the downhill at the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics, the first
downhill gold for an American.</TE>
<TE>   On March 22, 2001, he fell during a training run at Montana's Big
Mountain resort while trying to qualify for the 2002 Games. He spent
three weeks in a coma.</TE>

<TE>   "I really don't have an exact timetable for returning to
competition," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods had surgery last week in Park City, Utah, to remove fluid
around ligaments in his left knee and to remove a benign cyst.</TE>
<TE>   Woods had a benign tumor removed from the same knee in 1994.</TE>

<HD>Master of NFL's Playoff Puzzle</HD>
<DH>Jumble in AFC makes this worst week for Labombarda, who
calculates league's postseason scenarios.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santo is making a list and checking it twice.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a few hundred more times.</LD>
<LD>   "This has been the worst week, the toughest week that I can
remember," said Santo Labombarda, the person responsible for drawing
up every possible NFL playoff scenario. "The NFC has been pretty
straightforward, but the AFC has been crazy."</LD>
<TE>   With 12 days remaining in the regular season, the AFC has yet to
award a postseason berth and 14 of 16 teams are in the running. Only
Cincinnati and Houston have been eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   There are 21 teams with a chance to make the playoffs, almost as
big a logjam as the nightmare of 1994, when a record 22 teams were
playoff-eligible with two weeks remaining -- and there were only 28
NFL teams, instead of the current 32.</TE>
<TE>   Figuring out every playoff permutation has become an obsession for
Labombarda, 37, who works for Elias Sports Bureau, the NFL's official
statistics keeper. He started there as a part-time employee when he
was in high school, and stayed through his years as a business major
at Manhattan's Baruch College. Except for a stint as a pizza
deliveryman when he was 14, this is the only job he has known.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people would think somebody like that would be the typical
nerd, but he's not," said Vince Casey, senior editorial manager for
the NFL. "He's an athletic guy, married with children. But he
obviously has the ability to crunch these numbers, look at them,
assimilate them, and figure out what a club needs to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of people in America wouldn't be able to do what he
does. It's incredibly tedious, and a lot depends on it. You don't
want to be wrong, and he's never wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Well, almost never. Labombarda said he has made a small
miscalculation here or there -- he issued a clarification Wednesday
on one possible scenario -- but has yet to make a glitch of any
consequence.</TE>
<TE>   This is complex stuff. For instance, Tennessee doesn't need to win
to clinch a playoff berth this weekend, as long as Miami wins or
ties, New England loses, Denver loses, and the Baltimore-Cleveland
game ends in a tie; or, if Miami wins or ties, and New England,
Denver and Cleveland lose.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like doing a puzzle," Labombarda said. "I'm not that good at
other types of puzzles, but I'm pretty good at this."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest longshot in the playoff race is Jacksonville (6-8),
which barely has a prayer. For starters, in order to stay alive, the
Jaguars need the Baltimore-Cleveland game to end in a tie.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I'll get a call from a team's [public-relations] guy
wanting to know what his team has to do," Labombarda said. "They'll
say, 'Give me a scenario where we can get in.' "</TE>
<TE>   The NFC picture is much more in focus. Philadelphia, Tampa Bay,
Green Bay and San Francisco have clinched spots. Atlanta and New
Orleans are on the verge. And the New York Giants have not been
mathematically eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the NFC running are Arizona, Carolina, Chicago, Dallas,
Detroit, Minnesota, St. Louis, Seattle and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But it looks as if the AFC will not be decided until the final
weekend of games. That means Labombarda will still be jotting down
possibilities on his scratchpad and punching numbers into his
computers.</TE>
<TE>   He's getting some help.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, my wife did all the Christmas shopping."</TE>

<HD>Cleveland Loses Brown to Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Courtney Brown was put on injured reserve Wednesday by the Cleveland
Browns, the latest blow to the injury-plagued defensive end who was
the first overall pick in the 2000 draft.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who has struggled through a season of injuries and
ineffective play, will have knee surgery today.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Butch Davis said Monday that Brown appears to have cartilage
damage -- but no ligament damage -- in his left knee.</LD>
<TE>   Brown bruised the knee during Cleveland's 24-15 victory over New
Orleans on Nov. 24. He played Dec. 1 against Carolina but sat out the
last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Brown started 16 games as a rookie. But in 2001 he sat out 11
games because of knee and ankle injuries, and ended the season on
injured reserve.</TE>
<TE>   When healthy, Brown has shown he could become the standout he was
projected to be. Against Chicago last season, he had three sacks and
returned a fumble recovery 35 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   He had only two sacks this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City running back Priest Holmes' season may have ended
because of a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say there's a good chance it's over," Coach Dick Vermeil
said after talking with doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes is definitely out for Sunday's game against San Diego,
Vermeil said. As for the regular-season finale at Oakland a week from
Saturday, Vermeil said, "I think it's doubtful."</TE>
<TE>   Vermeil will not automatically place Holmes on the injured reserve
list because specialists in Kansas City, New York and Florida have
agreed there is a possibility Holmes could return this season.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes left Sunday's game against Denver when he was pulled down
awkwardly after a 56-yard run that boosted his rushing total for the
season to a franchise-record 1,615 yards, passing Miami's Ricky
Williams for the league lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA running back Skip Hicks signed with Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   To make room for Hicks, the Panthers put Lamar Smith on injured
reserve. Smith was charged with drunken driving last month and has
been on a leave of absence since his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks spent last year with the Tennessee Titans, who released him
before this season. He has played in 38 games in four years, rushing
for 1,109 yards and 13 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston offensive lineman DeMingo Graham was suspended by the
league for four games for using a banned substance. He will sit out
the last two games this season and the first two next season....Miami
guard Jamie Nails had surgery on his left Achilles' tendon and
arthroscopic surgery on his knees to relieve swelling and other
problems....Cornerback Jason Bostic was put on the Buffalo Bills'
injured reserve list after having surgery to repair torn ligaments in
his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Jacksonville offensive lineman Jeff Novak accepted a
$2-million settlement in his malpractice lawsuit against a former
team doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was reached Aug. 6, according to the Florida state
department of health.</TE>
<TE>   Novak was awarded a $5.35-million judgment against Stephen Lucie
in July, but a judge threw out the verdict days later, saying Novak
did not prove he received negligent treatment for a bone bruise in
1998 that allegedly led to infections that ended his career.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Bruins have stopped doing what gave them the NHL's best
record for the first two months of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Having dropped four straight, now the Bruins can't beat one of the
league's worst teams.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Gratton scored his first goal in nearly a month and added
three assists as the Buffalo Sabres beat the Bruins, 4-2, Wednesday
at Buffalo, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not playing our game right now," Bruin forward Brian
Rolston said. "It's very simple, we're giving up 2-on-1, 2-on-0s,
things we don't do normally. You just try to work as hard as you can
to get out of it, that's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Knuble and Sergei Samsonov, back after missing four games
with a groin injury, scored for Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have been outscored, 17-6, during their longest losing
streak since a four-game skid from Feb. 28 to March 6 last season.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Dumont, Taylor Pyatt and Stu Barnes also scored for Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Atlanta 1 -- At Atlanta, Robert Esche stopped 23
shots as the Flyers extended their unbeaten streak to five games.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Williams, Mark Recchi and Donald Brashear scored for the
Flyers, who are 4-0-1 in their last five games and lead the Atlantic
Division with 40 points.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, New Jersey 0 -- Patrick Lalime had 27 saves, leading the
Senators at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Radek Bonk scored two goals and Martin Havlat had two assists, as
the Senators beat the Devils for the second time in five days.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Florida 2 -- Jaroslav Bednar scored in the third
period, and Roberto Luongo had 29 saves as the Panthers rallied to
tie the Maple Leafs at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 1, Tampa Bay 1 -- Brad Richards scored in the first
period, and Nikolai Khabibulin allowed just one goal against Carolina
for a third straight game.</TE>
<TE>   The tie at Raleigh, N.C., kept the Lightning three points ahead of
second-place Carolina in the Southeast Division.</TE>

<HD>Avalanche Fires Hartley; Granato Takes Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Bob Hartley led the Colorado Avalanche to four straight Western
Conference finals and a Stanley Cup championship in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't enough to save his job.</LD>
<LD>   Citing a slow start and a lack of passion in his team, Colorado
General Manager Pierre Lacroix fired Hartley on Wednesday after 4 1/2
seasons.</LD>
<TE>   "We are an organization with very, very high expectations,"
Lacroix said. "We've done it every year that we've been in Denver and
it's no different this season. It was obvious that the team is not
showing any emotion, the team is not doing what it needs to do to
fulfill these expectations, so I am convinced it was the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Lacroix said assistant coach Tony Granato will take over as
Colorado's permanent coach.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley, who was promoted from Hershey in 1998, is Colorado's wins
leader at 193-109-48. He was 49-31 in the playoffs and was the first
coach since Chicago's Billy Reay in 1967 to take his team to the
conference finals his first four years.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of the business," Hartley said. "Everyone has
different opinions and that's the way Pierre feels."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado finished within a game of reaching the Stanley Cup finals
last season, but wasn't able to break out of an early-season funk
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche traded Chris Drury and Stephane Yelle to Calgary for
Derek Morris, Dean McAmmond and Jeff Shantz just before the season in
an effort to give the team a boost. It hasn't worked.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado, which is vying for an NHL-record ninth straight division
title, is 10-8-9-4 this season. The Avalanche has 33 points, 10
behind Northwest Division leader Minnesota, and has struggled at
home, winning only three of 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Granato, who retired in 2001 after 13 NHL seasons, including seven
with the Kings, got the job despite having no prior NHL coaching
experience before this year. He joined the Avalanche as an assistant
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time someone loses their job, it's tough on all of us, but
when asked to step in the experience is no problem at all," Granato
said. "I am very experienced."</TE>

<LD>The storied tradition, the hallowed arena, the three pride-grinding,
early-season losses.</LD>
<LD>   Sorry, Kansas, you'll get no sympathy in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Losing to North Carolina, Florida and Oregon hardly rates.</LD>
<TE>   Not next to UCLA's losses to San Diego, Duke and Northern Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   By all appearances, you can practically pencil in the next Bruin
loss Saturday, when UCLA travels to play Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse,
where the Rock-Chalk-Jayhawk crowd is hungry for a victory over a
big-name -- if not big-game -- team.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas has plummeted from No. 2 to No. 19 in Associated Press
polls since the season began.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to pretty much get upset with anything around here
other than a national championship. You can't pay attention to it,"
forward Nick Collison said. "I don't think anyone on our team
panicked like the fans and the media did.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while, the media made a big deal, wondering what was going
on. People were pretty concerned. We lost to some good teams, and
then we had a good win at Tulsa. Still, 5-3 -- around here, that's
unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   Almost as unheard of as UCLA's 2-3 record.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's only hope Saturday would seem to be some variation of the
formula in last season's 87-77 upset of then-No. 1 Kansas at Pauley
Pavilion. UCLA's guards proved too big for Kansas to shoot over, the
Bruins held the Jayhawk running game in check, and Matt Barnes played
like a pro. (Barnes, however, is not available this season.)</TE>
<TE>   "It really doesn't matter, I guess, what they've done and what
we've done when they come in here Saturday," Collison said. "They're
capable of playing very well. They're very talented. And we're not
necessarily on top of the world at 5-3."</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, Steve Lavin's spin -- early-season lumps breed Sweet 16
runs -- started before the season began, but things are spinning out
of control now.</TE>
<TE>   At Kansas, the story line has been the opposite through the years.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks tended to run through November and December with one,
maybe two losses, then endure a hail of criticism when they stumbled
in a second- or third-round NCAA tournament loss.</TE>
<TE>   The pattern changed last season, when Kansas lost only to Ball
State and UCLA during the regular season, then lost to Oklahoma in
the Big 12 tournament before sweeping to the Final Four, where the
Jayhawks lost to Maryland in the semifinals -- still two steps shy of
the goal.</TE>
<TE>   This season, with Drew Gooden thriving in Memphis and Jeff Boschee
gone too, Kansas, with its shallow bench, struggled early.</TE>
<TE>   Now the play of such reserves as guard Michael Lee is helping the
Jayhawks come along.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this team had an identity crisis," guard Keith Langford
said. "We still thought we were the team last year with Drew Gooden
and Jeff Boschee that went to the Final Four. It really hit us that
this is a new year. Teams are not going to lay down because Kansas is
on our jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, the media has been very critical this year with three losses
this early. We didn't lose our third game last year until March.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we fall into what the media is saying, we'll crumble.
But they have no control over what we do. We win five, six, seven
games in a row, the media will jump back on our bandwagon."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA can only wish to manage the same.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a win," Langford said. "Whether it's UCLA or not, this is
a must-win for both basketball teams."</TE>
<TE>   Agony of the Feet</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's season took a hit this week when point guard Chris
Hernandez broke his left foot again, only two games after returning
from the earlier injury.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with losses to Montana and Richmond in its own Stanford
Invitational -- the first time Stanford has finished last -- the news
is all bad for a team that had started surprisingly well, earning a
top-25 ranking with victories over Xavier and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, a sophomore, becomes a redshirt candidate, forcing
Julius Barnes, a more natural shooting guard, to play the point.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, with a screw still in his foot after healing from the
earlier break, called the injury "a freak thing."</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be out indefinitely," Coach Mike Montgomery said. "It's the
same bone, but not the same break. The outside of the bone, where it
was originally, is healed. It kind of snuck around from the inside of
the bone around to the other side, around the screw, something our
doctors have never seen before, especially with the screw in that
bone."</TE>
<TE>   The news is better at Arizona regarding the ankle sprain that kept
Luke Walton out of the Texas game. He is expected to return for the
Fiesta Bowl Classic on Dec. 28, and be ready for the Pacific 10
Conference opener Jan. 2 at Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "Long-term wise, it's fine," Coach Lute Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, Arizona will leave Walton at home when the
Wildcats travel to Louisiana State for a game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The reason? Walton is graduating this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "We just thought it would be better for him to be here to walk
with his class, and be able to get the full attention of trainers,"
Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   In injury news elsewhere, progress has not been good for Chris
Marcus, the 7-footer from Western Kentucky who passed up the NBA
draft in hopes of improving his status after a season marred by foot
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus has yet to play and last week had a second operation on his
left ankle after a screw implanted in his foot in June caused
problems. He is expected to be out at least until early January,
though Coach Dennis Felton said a Jan. 4 target date was probably
"ambitious."</TE>
<TE>   Cornhusker State  Hoop Hysteria</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska is supposed to be football territory -- or at least it
was before this season -- but the big game in Lincoln on Saturday is
when the Cornhuskers play host to No. 20 Creighton.</TE>
<TE>   The 8-0 Bluejays have been called "this year's Kent State" by
Notre Dame Coach Mike Brey, whose team lost to Creighton.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Kyle Korver and his teammates aren't complete newcomers.
They upset Florida in the first round of the NCAA tournament last
season, and Korver is tearing it up again, with five games already in
which he has made five or more three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska, coming off a 13-15 season and off to a 4-3 start, is the
decided underdog against the team from Omaha, about 55 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "There probably will be quite a few Creighton fans at our place.
It's going to be loud," Nebraska forward Brian Conklin said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always been known as a football state. Now we have Creighton
ranked and we're playing very good basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of pride because you run into these</TE>
<TE>   guys. And we all want to show this state can play basketball as
well as football."</TE>
<TE>   Around the Rim</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis, New Orleans and San Antonio are familiar Final Four
sites on the list of the six cities being considered to play host to
the championships from 2008-11. The reason: Domes rule. Guidelines
call for a minimum of 40,000 seats and the city must have 8,500
first-class hotel rooms available for the official block. Other
cities on the list: Detroit, Houston and St. Louis. The familiar
rotation continues next spring, with the 2003 Final Four in New
Orleans, followed by San Antonio, St. Louis, Indianapolis and
Atlanta.... Craig Smith, a freshman forward who played with Evan
Burns at Fairfax High before spending last season at Worcester
(Mass.) Academy, is making his mark at Boston College. Smith averaged
21 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.5 steals in victories over Iowa State
and Stony Brook.</TE>

<HD>'Strangeglove' Stuart Dead at Age 70</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>REDWOOD CITY</DL>
<LD>Dick Stuart, a slugger whose bad fielding earned him the nickname
"Dr. Strangeglove," has died.</LD>
<LD>   Stuart died Sunday. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   An All-Star in 1961, the first baseman hit .264 with 228 home runs
and 743 RBIs in a 10-year career. He played for Pittsburgh, Boston,
Philadelphia, the New York Mets, the Dodgers in 1966 and the Angels
in 1969.</LD>
<TE>   Stuart was in the on-deck circle at Forbes Field when Bill
Mazeroski hit the home run in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series that
lifted the Pirates over the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart earned his place in baseball lore in 1956, hitting 66 home
runs for Lincoln of the Class A Western League. From then on, he
always put a "66" with his name when he signed autographs.</TE>
<TE>   A poor outfielder, Stuart was moved to first base by the Pirates
when he made his major league debut in 1958. Even so, he struggled,
making 16 errors in only 64 games that season.</TE>

<HD>Flyers' Roenick Gets Two-Game Suspension</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philadelphia Flyer forward Jeremy Roenick was suspended for two games
by the NHL on Wednesday for his hit on Dallas Stars' center Mike
Modano.</LD>
<LD>   Roenick checked Modano hard in the first period, knocking him out
of Tuesday night's game. Modano had scored in the first minute.</LD>
<LD>   Modano fell to the ice, and remained there for several minutes,
before being helped to the dressing room. He complained of headaches,
but the Stars ruled out a concussion and said he could be ready for
tonight's game at Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously I'm disappointed," said Roenick, who sat out
Wednesday's game in Atlanta. "But I'm more disappointed that the
whole thing happened. I knew something had to come down when somebody
gets injured."</TE>
<TE>   Roenick said he was anticipating Modano to make a move on the
boards, but instead the Dallas player pivoted the other way, creating
a full collision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mario Lemieux leads the NHL in scoring and in fan voting for the
All-Star Game. The Pittsburgh Penguin forward, who has 55 points,
received 109,075 votes as of Wednesday. New York Ranger defenseman
Brian Leetch is second in the Eastern Conference with 95,328. Detroit
defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom is the leading vote-getter in the West
with 95,366.</TE>

<HD>Matching Lavin's Mark Would Do Dorrell Well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be unfair, of course, to suggest the Bruins have just hired
the football equivalent to Steve Lavin, untested, fresh-faced and
eager to learn on the job as a head coach at a major university,
because there is no way yet to know if Karl Dorrell will be as
successful as Lavin.</LD>
<LD>   Fast forward six years from now, and if the Bruins finish among
the top 16 teams in the nation five times in that span of time, will
it be satisfactory?</LD>
<LD>   By all accounts today it is a great hire, an inspired hire,
because the excitement of the unknown feels so much more promising
than the announcement UCLA has just hired a guy with a losing record
wherever he has been the head coach.</LD>
<TE>   Dorrell, meanwhile, is a former Bruin, who will be walking into
familiar and friendly territory, while also becoming the fourth
African American head coach working at one of the 117 Division I-A
football programs in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   It makes for a great story, and while no one other than the Page
Two columnist can quibble with hiring a head coach at this level with
training wheels still attached, your guess right now on how well he
will do is probably no better or worse than the guy who just hired
his first head football coach. In fact, with this hire, we're going
to learn a lot more down the road about Dan Guerrero, and the
instincts that drive him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I wouldn't have taken Pete Carroll two years ago, even when
USC appeared to have no other choice, and it's a good thing it's the
only time I can recall being so wrong. (I have USC losing to Iowa in
the Orange Bowl, and so we're going to find out if my mistakes are
only confined to what happens with the Trojans).</TE>
<TE>   I probably would've hired Mike Riley, first at USC and now at
UCLA, because I saw him at work during the best and the worst of
times, and while his record is lopsided with losses, there are solid
reasons why he has been in demand.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago he turned down an offer from Indiana to wait for
Stanford -- told by so many the job would be his -- and then it went
to someone else. This time it was Alabama offering him millions,
which he rejected to wait on UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   But when the call came Wednesday night, it was old friend and UCLA
Assistant Athletic Director Bob Field telling him Guerrero would be
calling later, but to save him the indignity of learning from someone
else he would not be getting the Bruins' job, Field filled him in.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed. I went after that job, wanted to be at UCLA and
didn't get it," Riley said. "No regrets, though. I'm not sitting here
now thinking I should've taken the Alabama job because that was a
separate decision. I'm not going to make decisions any more based on
money -- besides, I have a year ($750,000) left on my San Diego
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was no shoo-in with UCLA when I turned Alabama down, but
I was excited about the chance to coach at UCLA. But I'm good with
this, and the professional way UCLA conducted this process. And from
everything I've heard about Karl Dorrell, it's a great hire. I wish
him well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN GUERRERO called Denver Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan Wednesday
afternoon, he was still asking questions about Dorrell and Greg
Robinson, the Kansas City Chiefs' defensive coordinator, who worked
previously for Shanahan.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan figured UCLA was going to hire Riley because of his
experience, but he continued to campaign for Dorrell and Robinson
when given the chance Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Karl will be great," said Shanahan after learning he had
gotten the job. "He's got everything you're looking for in a coach.
He's smart, well-organized, and will go out there and recruit better
than anybody. It's a great hire for UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   But can he be successful given his lack of experience as a head
coach?</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good question," said Shanahan, who turned down an
opportunity to coach the Broncos to remain in San Francisco as an
assistant to gain more experience before accepting the job in Denver
when it was offered again. "The big knock on me becoming a head coach
was I was too nice and I couldn't make the tough decision. Now
everyone calls me an ogre.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know how a guy is going to do until he does it, but
this much I know about Karl -- he's a worker, and I've watched the
way he handles himself and players. I see no reason why he won't be
successful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BRONCOS play in Oakland Sunday, and afterward, Shanahan said,
he will sit down with Dorrell and advise him to leave immediately to
begin work at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to get going, hire his staff and recruit," Shanahan
said, "so I'm not going to make him stay here.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're going to like this guy," added Shanahan, who came
to the Broncos as an untested pro assistant coach almost 20 years ago
while I was covering the team on a daily basis. "I'd like to think
I'm as good as you are at getting under someone's skin, and no matter
how hard I tried, I couldn't do it with this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Now there's a challenge ... I know this, I just hope when it's all
said and done, he has had as good a career at UCLA as Lavin has had.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I MADE my annual visit to a Mighty Ducks' game Wednesday, met with
goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere before he played against St. Louis and
told him his scoreless streak was making the sport even duller than
it already is.</TE>
<TE>   Then I received a call from the office that Dorrell had been
hired, and maybe I should forget the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   You can imagine my disappointment ... although I see by the final
score that Giguere took my advice, and put a little more excitement
back into the game.</TE>

<HD>Donovan, McBride Stay in U.S.</HD>

<LD>Major League Soccer has scored an impressive double victory this
week, first by being able to keep Landon Donovan in the league and,
on Wednesday, by making sure that Brian McBride sticks around too.</LD>
<LD>   The two United States national team players, both of whom enjoyed
an outstanding World Cup, could have returned to Europe had MLS not
made significant efforts to keep them.</LD>
<LD>   First, the league persuaded Bayer Leverkusen, the German
Bundesliga team that owns Donovan's contract until 2007, to allow the
20-year-old to remain on loan with the San Jose Earthquakes for
another two seasons. Donovan helped the Earthquakes win the MLS
championship in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Columbus Crew announced that McBride, 30, will
stay with the team at least through the 2005 season.</TE>
<TE>   The striker, referred to as "a cornerstone of American soccer" by
MLS deputy commissioner Ivan Gazidis, has scored 59 goals in 159
regular-season and playoff games for Columbus and helped the team win
the U.S. Open Cup in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Having played briefly in England with Preston North End, McBride
was rumored to be heading for Manchester City in the English Premier
League. Instead, he now appears likely to end his career in the MLS.</TE>
<TE>   Centenary Match</TE>
<TE>   European champion Real Madrid celebrated its centenary in style
Wednesday night by coming from three goals down to tie a star-studded
World Selection, 3-3, in front of 55,000 rain-drenched fans at
Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   Second-half goals by Santiago Solari, Tote and Esteban Cambiasso
sent the crowd home happy after Germany's Miroslav Klose, Brazil's
Kaka and Senegal's Aliou Cisse had put the world all-star team in
apparent control.</TE>
<TE>   Even the halftime entertainment was something out of the ordinary,
with Spanish tenor Placido Domingo, a Real Madrid fan, singing the
club's hymn, accompanied by a full symphony orchestra and flanked by
the two teams.</TE>
<TE>   Morelia Wins</TE>
<TE>   Morelia gained the slimmest possible advantage in Mexico's
championship final Wednesday night when it defeated Toluca, 1-0, in
front of 40,000 fans at the Estadio Morelos in Morelia in the first
game of the two-game series.</TE>
<TE>   A 58th-minute goal by Javier Saavedra provided the edge as
Monarcas goalkeeper Moises Munoz shut out the Red Devils, ending the
15-game scoring streak of their Paraguayan striker, Jose Cardozo.</TE>
<TE>   The second game is Saturday at Toluca.</TE>
<TE>   Celtic Woes</TE>
<TE>   Scottish champion Glasgow Celtic, which saw six of its fans
arrested after causing a disturbance aboard a charter flight last
week, came in for more bad news Wednesday when three of its players
were arrested in connection with the theft of a newspaper
photographer's camera at a nightclub in Newcastle, England. The three
players, who were not identified, were released on bail, pending a
court appearance in March.</TE>
<TE>   Zamorano Move</TE>
<TE>   Chilean World Cup striker Ivan "Bam Bam" Zamorano, who has played
for Club America in Mexico for the last two years, returned home to
Chile and reportedly will join Colo Colo after turning down offers
from MLS, Japan's J-League and the Saudi Arabian league.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Passes</TE>
<TE>   Sir Bert Millichip, chairman of England's Football Assn. for 15
years, died Wednesday at age 88 after collapsing at a social function
in Birmingham, England.... Former coach of Spain's national team,
Javier Clemente, 52, was named coach of Espanyol in the Spanish first
division.... UCLA defender Scot Thompson was named to the U.S.
under-23 national team that will play Canada in two friendly games in
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., today and Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Bruins Throw It to Dorrell</HD>
<DH>Bronco assistant talks his way into the job with a strong
interview and becomes the fourth African American head coach in
Division I-A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The next time UCLA falls behind in a football game, the players need
only look to their coach for inspiration. In what those close to the
situation believe was a dramatic upset Wednesday, Karl Dorrell was
named Bruin football coach.</LD>
<LD>   The Denver Bronco assistant nosed out New Orleans Saint assistant
Mike Riley, an older, more experienced candidate who was the favorite
of Athletic Director Dan Guerrero until the waning hours of the
nine-day search.</LD>
<LD>   Dorrell, a former UCLA receiver, had the endorsement of a large
and impressive group of former players. But in the end, the support
meant less than Dorrell's forcefully making his case to Chancellor
Albert Carnesale in a three-hour interview Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The chancellor, sources said, was impressed by Dorrell's clear
vision to elevate UCLA to the upper echelon of football programs. And
Carnesale took note when Dorrell alluded to UCLA's rich tradition of
ground-breaking African American athletes, from Jackie Robinson to
Arthur Ashe.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero listened as well, and by midafternoon had offered Dorrell
a rollover contract of $700,000 a year for six to seven years. Two
hours later -- and on his 39th birthday -- Dorrell accepted and the
Bruins had their 15th coach and first of African American heritage.
He becomes the fourth current African-American Division I-A football
coach and only the 18th ever.</TE>
<TE>   "It has always been a dream of mine to someday return to campus as
the head coach at this great university," Dorrell said. "I can't wait
to get started."</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell will be introduced at a news conference at UCLA at noon
today. He is expected to return to Denver for the Broncos' game
against the Oakland Raiders on Sunday, then turn his attention to his
new team. He is not expected to coach the Bruins in the Las Vegas
Bowl on Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   "Karl Dorrell is an outstanding fit for UCLA," Guerrero said.
"Everyone with whom I spoke held Karl in high regard.</TE>
<TE>   "Karl is a man of high principles who I feel is well-suited to the
college game. The fact that he enjoyed an outstanding career as a
Bruin player gives him an appreciation for what a special place UCLA
is."</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell inherits a team that is 7-5 despite playing 22 freshmen,
including three at quarterback. Bob Toledo had a 49-32 record but
off-the-field incidents involving player conduct and losses to rival
USC the last four years triggered his firing.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of Dorrell is designed to knife away those memories
as well as bring longtime loyal Bruins back into the fold. Those who
have known him as a player and through his career as an offensive
coordinator at Colorado and Washington were overjoyed at his
selection.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to death and proud as a peacock," said Terry
Donahue, the Bruin coach from 1976 to '95. Dorrell played in 1982,
'83, '85 and '86, made 108 receptions and was part of three Rose Bowl
championship teams under Donahue.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't imagine a better candidate," Donahue said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Karl was in consideration and I am very happy for Karl and
his family and the Bruins and the UCLA family."</TE>
<TE>   Riley, who turned down an offer from Alabama last week and
expressed his desire for the UCLA opening, said he was disappointed.
Kansas City Chief assistant Greg Robinson, the third candidate who
interviewed with Carnesale, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA told Riley that he was impressive in his interview. Dorrell
simply was deemed a better choice.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me there were [no red flags]," Riley said. "That was
good to hear."</TE>
<TE>   Most Bruin players and their parents don't know much about
Dorrell, but they are excited nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really anxious to meet him and I think the rest of the guys
are too," freshman tailback Tyler Ebell said. "It's great he's from
UCLA. I think schools like to keep it in the family, and he'll know
what it's like to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Said sophomore cornerback Matt Ware: "I heard that he was a real
fierce competitor and student of the game. Having a guy who played as
a Bruin is exciting to me."</TE>
<TE>   Ware's parents, Bernard and Julie, are UCLA graduates who quietly
pulled for Dorrell once his name surfaced as a candidate to replace
Toledo, who was fired Dec. 9 after seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope people support him and are not too critical in the early
stages," Bernard Ware said. "Let him get his recruiting and his staff
together and let him get his feet underneath him.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA is the school of [African American Nobel Peace Prize winner]
Ralph Bunche, Arthur Ashe, Jackie Robinson and Rafer Johnson. And
this is one more step in that succession. We should be a school that
steps out and gives opportunities to African Americans, and I'm
excited about that too."</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell joins Tyrone Willingham of Notre Dame, Fitz Hill of San
Jose State and Tony Samuel of New Mexico State as African American
Division I-A football coaches. But those who know Dorrell say his
skin color is secondary to his excellence as a coach and as a person.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think UCLA could have picked a better man for the job,"
Bronco receiver Ed McCaffrey said. "I really think he's helped me as
a wide receiver. When he came to the Broncos, I was already a veteran
and Rod Smith and I were interested in how he could help us. He broke
down film and analyzed defenses and I can honestly say he really made
our jobs easier.</TE>
<TE>   "I also saw the way he was able to motivate and teach the young
receivers. He's very dedicated to his job, very patient with his
players and relates to all kinds of people. He gets people to play
their best, which leads me to believe he would be a great head
coach."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's recruiting efforts, hampered by the uncertainty, should
pick up. Dorrell first will try to solidify the intentions of
prospects who have committed to UCLA and then turn his attention to
bringing in new talent.</TE>
<TE>   Because Dorrell has no head coaching experience, he does not have
the stable of assistant coaches that Riley could have tapped.
Colorado assistant John Embree, Washington assistant Steve Axman and
Bronco assistant Brian Pariani are strong possibilities to join the
Bruin staff.</TE>
<TE>   After his interview Tuesday, Dorrell said he had made discreet
calls to prospective assistants.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how to build a staff effectively, and it will be well
thought out," said Tom Ramsey, a former Bruin quarterback. "He will
be disciplined in his approach and very thorough."</TE>
<TE>   As a player, Dorrell developed a reputation as being
self-motivated and highly disciplined. He sometimes was a loner who
preferred working out to partying. He and his wife, Kim, have two
children, 7 and 4 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew if people would just look at Karl, they would be very
impressed," said Michael Young, a Bronco official who played with
Dorrell at UCLA. "He has such a clean track record and so much
ability.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan Guerrero did the smart thing, not the safe thing. He is
sending a message that this is a new era in athletics at UCLA."</TE>

<HD>Dorrell Winning the Popular Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former UCLA players and coaches, some of whom felt distanced from the
football program during former coach Bob Toledo's tenure, are
praising Wednesday's hiring of Karl Dorrell as UCLA's 15th head
coach.</LD>
<LD>   They universally feel that the off-field problems will quickly
stop with Dorrell, who has a strong sense of discipline that can be
traced back to his playing years at UCLA from 1982-86, when teammates
would practically try to drag the former receiver out the door on
weekend nights, only to be rebuffed by the serious-minded Dorrell.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe Karl is going to make an immediate impact," said former
UCLA receiver Michael Young. "Give him two years and I think you'll
see a big change in the makeup of the players and how they conduct
themselves. He will not stand for players to not be disciplined.</LD>
<TE>   "In the last few years, it was like we were becoming another
Miami. A lot of alumni could have stomached some of these incidents
if [the Bruins] were in the running for a national championship or
beating USC, but that was not happening. It really marred the
university."</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA coach Terry Donahue, now the general manager of the
San Francisco 49ers, coached Dorrell in the mid-1980s at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Donahue, who was somewhat estranged from UCLA during Toledo's
tenure, now feels like he is again a card-carrying member of the
Bruin family.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that one of our own is head coach is certainly going to
bring me a lot closer in terms of involvement and participation,"
Donahue said.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1999, Toledo began to distance the UCLA program from
the image of its past, showing particular disdain for the "gutty
little Bruins" phrase that characterized the undersized but
overachieving teams of the Donahue era.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like that term," Toledo said in September 1999. "I hate
to keep talking about it because there's a lot of great old, gutty
little Bruins out there, but this is a new era. We're no longer that.
We're not little anymore. I appreciate what they were in the past and
I respect them, but it was a different era. And this is an era of big
people."</TE>
<TE>   Former players said they were not encouraged to drop by practice
and were not asked to offer insight in a mentoring capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the one thing Coach Donahue did -- we liked to see the
Freeman McNeils and Kenny Easleys, the Mark Harmons and John
Sciarras. They used to be around and they'd come and work out with us
in the off-season," Young said. "From what I was told, that was not
something that was part of the program [in recent years]."</TE>
<TE>   Said former quarterback Matt Stevens: "I think there should be a
lot more mentorship between ex-players and young players. I don't
know if that was happening when Bob Toledo was there."</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell is being described by former teammates as a reserved,
even-keeled type who will neither grieve after a loss nor dance at
midfield after a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Karl is very consistent in his demeanor, and I can tell you from
my years in the NFL and at UCLA that players like that in a coach,"
Young said. "What players do not like is a coach that you don't know
who is going to show up from day to day. That's where players begin
to have problems. Karl will be the same guy when they get beat as
when they win.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm a kid in Southern California right now, if they had not
made these changes, there is no decision ... you go to USC."</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA receiver Mike Sherrard, who played most of his nine
years in the NFL with San Francisco and the New York Giants, said
Dorrell was a solid choice.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA defeated USC in three of the four years Dorrell played (they
also won in 1984, when he used a redshirt season).</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how to beat USC and he knows how tough it is to lose to
them," Sherrard said. "It's a gutsy move by [Dan] Guerrero ... it
would have been easier to go with an established head coach, but I
give Guerrero a lot of credit for going with a younger guy."</TE>
<TE>   Former players also approved of Dorrell being selected instead of
New Orleans Saints' assistant Mike Riley ... and not because Riley is
a former USC assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard nothing but good things about Riley, but [the UCLA
job] might have been more of a nice stop for him," Stevens said. "For
Karl Dorrell, this is not only his dream, but his destiny.</TE>
<TE>   "If Karl Dorrell was going to run for president, you wouldn't find
anything wrong with this guy."</TE>

<HD>Palmer's Return Is Roaring Success</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carson Palmer spent four days telling various audiences he could not
wait to share the Heisman Trophy with the teammates who helped him
win it.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer finally got the opportunity on Wednesday during a raucous
team meeting that preceded USC's first workout in a week with the
starting quarterback present.</LD>
<LD>   Trojan players are familiar with Heisman hardware because they
walk past the trophies won by Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Charles
White and Marcus Allen almost daily in the Heritage Hall lobby.
Palmer's trophy was on display at the front of the meeting room, not
behind glass.</LD>
<TE>   "He said it was just as much our award as his, that it was a team
thing and wished everybody could have been there," freshman safety
Mike Ross said. "Everyone was going a little crazy."</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, the Trojans adjourned to Howard Jones Field for
a crisp one-hour workout that included a series of sprints.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer looked sharp during passing drills despite having spent six
days on the banquet circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to be back in L.A., back on the field, and back to
practicing again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll called the workout a tuneup for today's
regular practice when the Trojans will begin preparations for their
Jan. 2 Orange Bowl game against Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to get everyone back and make sure everyone is
here so we can make the most of [today's] practice," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC will practice today through Monday, then take two days off
before departing for Miami on Dec. 26.... Practices are closed to the
public and signs have been posted outside Howard Jones Field
forbidding autograph seekers from approaching players going to and
from practice.</TE>

<LD>The break in USC's schedule -- a respite that has the Trojans playing
only once between Dec. 12 and Jan. 1 -- is not only letting nagging
injuries heal. It's also giving a frustrated Errick Craven time to
work on his wounded psyche.</LD>
<LD>   The sophomore shooting guard, who started the season as USC's
leading returning scorer, has been burdened by high expectations and
he's having trouble finishing drives to the basket, a strength last
season.</LD>
<LD>   "I've just been collecting some thoughts," said Craven, who also
has been bothered by a cyst in his left (shooting) wrist. "Now I've
just got to go out there and play. It's all mental."</LD>
<TE>   "If I can just finish half of my shots that I usually make, then
we're not having this conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Craven is USC's second-leading scorer, averaging 11.4 points, down
slightly from last year's 11.8 average, and he is shooting only 33.9%
from the field, down from 45% last year. Inexplicably, he's making
46.2% of his three-point shots, 13.8 percentage points higher than
last year's rate.</TE>
<TE>   Craven discounted the cyst.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't bothered me until now, since high school," he said. "I
guess it's the cold."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Henry Bibby said Wednesday that he had not heard any
official word on Jerry Dupree's academic status and did not know when
to expect it or the junior forward's return. Bibby did say, though,
that Dupree would not be welcomed back until, "He gets his life
together."</TE>
<TE>   Dupree's six-game suspension has ended, but because he dropped a
class in the fall semester and fell below full-time student status,
and because Dupree needs above a 2.0 grade-point average in the fall
to pull himself out of academic probation, he is not allowed to
rejoin the team until after grades are posted.</TE>

<HD>USC Stars Light Final Four Path</HD>
<DH>Emily Adams and Alicia Robinson are pooling their athletic
resources for a volleyball title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC is playing for a national championship this week and helping to
lead the way are Emily Adams and Alicia Robinson, daughters of former
NBA players.</LD>
<LD>   However, Adams and Robinson are sophomores on the women's
volleyball team, not the school's basketball team, and the top-ranked
Trojans are in New Orleans for their second appearance in three years
in the NCAA Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   USC (29-1) will play Florida (34-2) in the semifinals tonight at
the New Orleans Arena. The Trojans, the top-seeded team in the
tournament, are trying to win their first championship in 21 years.</LD>
<TE>   Adams, 6 feet 5, and Robinson, 6-2, will start tonight for a team
that has its best record since 1976, when it finished 34-1 in its
first year.</TE>
<TE>   "Emily, Alicia and Keao [Burdine] are the keys to our future,"
Coach Mick Haley said. "They'll form the leadership base for the
coming year."</TE>
<TE>   Alvan Adams, Emily's father, played 14 seasons with the Phoenix
Suns. Leonard "Truck" Robinson, Alicia's father, was a 10-year NBA
veteran and a teammate of Adams' for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in the Phoenix area, the girls, who are now roommates,
often played with or against each other in sports ranging from
softball to soccer to club volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   In high school, Adams' school, Xavier Prep, often defeated
neighboring Central, Robinson's school, on its way to three state
volleyball championships in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their bloodlines, basketball was, perhaps, their least
favorite sport. Adams said she played it only in a park league and
preferred softball and soccer. Robinson hardly played it at all.</TE>
<TE>   Alvan Adams said he never steered his daughter in any direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted her to narrow her number of sports down and pick
two of them to play in high school," said Adams, now the vice
president of facilities management for Bank One Ballpark and America
West Arena. "We went to [a volleyball] match where Xavier was playing
Central and they were the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the state at the
time. It was a great match.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Emily if she ever saw herself being that intense, like
those girls. She said, 'Yeah, I do.' "</TE>
<TE>   One of the tallest players in USC history, Adams, a middle
blocker, ranks third in the nation with a .419 hitting percentage and
leads the team with a 1.37 blocks per game average.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, an outside hitter, earned Pacific 10 Conference
honorable mention honors as a freshman but struggled early as a
starter this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was having some problems with my timing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson has a team-leading 116 hitting errors but came through
with 11 kills in the Trojans' three-game regional final victory over
Pepperdine.</TE>

<HD>Simi Police Chief Picked to Lead Glendale Agency</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley Police Chief Randy Adams has been appointed Glendale's
police chief, Glendale city officials announced Wednesday. He will
assume the new post Jan. 31.</LD>
<LD>   Adams, 51, replaces longtime Chief Russell Siverling, who retired
this week. Capt. Ron DePompa is serving as interim chief. Meanwhile,
Simi Valley Police Capt. Mark Layhew was named as Adams' successor.</LD>
<LD>   "I am proud to be selected and look forward to joining the
Glendale Police Department and continuing to build on its fine
reputation," Adams said in a statement. He takes over a department
with 244 sworn officers and 114 civilian employees.</LD>
<TE>   As Simi Valley chief since 1995, Adams oversaw 120 officers and 66
civilian employees. In recent years, the city has consistently vied
with Thousand Oaks as the nation's safest city of 100,000 or more
population.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Adams served for 23 years in the Ventura Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   He holds master's degrees in management from Cal Poly Pomona and
administration of justice from Cal Lutheran University. He earned a
bachelor's in police science and administration from Cal State Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Adams has served as president of the California Peace Officers
Assn. and graduated from the Peace Officer Standards and Training
Command College and the FBI National Academy.</TE>

<HD>Project Study Goes to Board</HD>
<DH>After three days of testimony, Ventura County supervisors
will begin deliberating the Ahmanson Ranch environmental report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overwhelmed by a third day of testimony and a hill of documents on
the controversial Ahmanson Ranch subdivision, Ventura County
supervisors decided Wednesday to sleep on the project and begin their
deliberations this morning.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors are being asked by the developer, Washington Mutual
Bank, to approve a new environmental study of the 3,050-home project
overlooking the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Washington Mutual could then seek permits from state and federal
agencies to break ground.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents want the supervisors to require more study before they
give the project the green light. The recent discovery of the
chemical perchlorate in a well for watering the project's golf
courses has alarmed critics, several state lawmakers and water
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Although perchlorate, which can cause thyroid cancer, received
little attention in the study supervisors are now evaluating, it
became the focus of 16 hours of public hearings that concluded
Wednesday. With every speaker, the stacks of reports, studies, maps
and other documents seemed to grow on the supervisors' dais.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm buried in paper here," Supervisor Kathy Long said, searching
for a particular document.</TE>
<TE>   As both sides wrapped up testimony, Supervisor Judy Mikels asked
repeat speakers to identify themselves again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm losing track of people's connections, and I'm trying to keep
it straight in my mind," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman John Flynn said he decided to begin deliberations
today, rather than Wednesday afternoon, so he and his colleagues can
review all the material.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go through the expert-written testimony," he said. "I
just want to have a better understanding of perchlorate. And I'm
getting that now."</TE>
<TE>   Perchlorate is used in the manufacture of rocket fuel, some
fertilizers, fireworks and vehicle air bags. It can cause a host of
health problems in humans and animals, even in small amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual has said it will use another source of water for
irrigation if the contaminated well cannot be made safe.</TE>
<TE>   The developer's lead attorney, Steve Weston, implored supervisors
to hold the Ahmanson Ranch project to the same standards as other
developments and not be distracted by what he said were opponents'
dogged efforts to stir up controversy and stall.</TE>
<TE>   "Be fair," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state's process for assessing the environmental impact of
building projects "is not intended to be an endless process that
drags on and on and on," Weston said.</TE>
<TE>   The $2-billion project was initially approved in 1992, but
developers ordered the new study after endangered frogs and flowers
were found on the property in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want to see Ahmanson Ranch devoted to parkland, not
homes, question why the developer opposes further study.</TE>
<TE>   "If they weren't afraid of what they'd find, they would simply
agree to further soil and water testing," said Chad Griffin,
spokesman for Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   However, opponents have another reason for delaying a vote. In
January they expect to gain an ally on the divided Board of
Supervisors: Supervisor-elect Linda Parks, who replaces Ahmanson
Ranch proponent Frank Schillo. Supervisors could delay voting until
after Parks joins the board.</TE>

<BD> From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sentencing of a Ventura woman convicted of murder for
participating in the 1998 slaying of a teenage girl has been delayed
to allow defense attorneys time to prepare a motion for a new trial.</LD>
<LD>   Bridget Callahan, 30, fired her former attorney this week, days
before her scheduled sentencing. She is facing a life prison term.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. agreed to postpone the
hearing to Feb. 13 to allow defense lawyers James Farley and Kay
Duffy time to review trial transcripts and prepare a new trial
motion. Farley and Duffy called her pending life sentence draconian.</LD>
<TE>   The postponement frustrated the relatives of 17-year-old Nichole
Hendrix of Ventura, who was stabbed to death four years ago,
allegedly at the hands of two of Callahan's cohorts, Michael
Bridgeford and David Ziesmer. They are awaiting trial on separate
murder charges.</TE>

<HD>Parents, Teachers Demand Ouster of Embattled Head Start
Program Official</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dozens of parents and teachers protested outside the offices of the
Latin American Civic Assn. in San Fernando on Wednesday, calling for
the ouster of the agency's executive director and accusing her of
fraud and mismanaging one of Los Angeles County's largest Head Start
child-care programs.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstration came a week after protests prompted the agency's
board of directors to launch an internal investigation and the county
Office of Education to pledge a more stringent audit of the
organization, which is expected to be completed in a month.</LD>
<LD>   Approximately 50 picketers marched back and forth at the corner of
Parkside Drive and Bradley Avenue, chanting "stop the harassment."</LD>
<TE>   They said LACA Executive Director Irene Tovar and supervisors have
been mistreating employees, some of whom have been fired.</TE>
<TE>   They also accuse Tovar of running the program to benefit her
political ambitions and of violating a union agreement by having one
of the agency's 24 school sites operate a triple shift as opposed to
a standard double shift.</TE>
<TE>   "We can stay silent no more about the heavy burden being
shouldered by the kitchen staff, family service workers and the
teachers," said Dorothy Williams, president of the American
Federation of Teachers Local 1475, which represents LACA instructors.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview at her office, Tovar continued to defend her
leadership, saying she is wrongfully blamed for the tension.</TE>
<TE>   She said new federal standards, which take effect next year,
require associate's and bachelor's degrees of at least half of the
agency's teachers, prompting some to fear for their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "When this is all over, it will show we are always committed to
the children," said Tovar, who addressed the board of directors in a
meeting Tuesday evening by discounting the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Among the accusations against Tovar and the 300-member agency is a
claim by teachers that they were pressured to lie about the number of
volunteer hours parents have contributed at the schools.</TE>
<TE>   For each hour documented, LACA receives a $15 funding credit. The
in-kind contributions are then factored toward the agency's
obligation to match 20% of the $9.76 million it receives in annual
federal funding.</TE>
<TE>   Tovar, a well-known Democratic politician and a former aide to
Jerry Brown when he was governor, openly opposed the San Fernando
Valley secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   She was criticized for allegedly using her position in LACA to
campaign, a charge she denies.</TE>
<TE>   Tovar took on directorship of the agency in 1993 when it was in
jeopardy of losing its contract with the county Office of Education
because of a large deficit. She said she has no plans to step down.</TE>
<TE>   "No agency is perfect," she said. "If things need to be corrected,
I will do it."</TE>

<HD>'Knock-Out Drops' Found in House Search, Deputy Testifies</HD>
<DH>Six suspicious bottles, as well as a video camera and 17
tapes, were discovered in the home of date-rape suspect Andrew
Luster, he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County sheriff's detectives found a video camera and six
small plastic bottles, including one labeled "knock-out drops,"
during a search of date-rape suspect Andrew Luster's beach house two
years ago, a sex crimes detective testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators searched the 39-year-old surfer's Mussel Shoals home
after a 21-year-old college student reported that Luster drugged and
raped her there after they met at a downtown Santa Barbara bar.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Scott Peterson testified that detectives were looking for
the date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, when they found the
six small bottles in a locked bedroom closet. Peterson did not
testify to the contents, but he read the labels after removing the
vials from a brown paper evidence bag.</LD>
<TE>   "Spanish Liquid, Hypnotic Hypo," the detective read. "Lollypop
Juice, Knock-out Drops ... Frigid Fluid."</TE>
<TE>   No GHB was ever found during three searches of Luster's home in
July 2000. But prosecutors argue the six bottles are evidence of
Luster's propensity to knock out women and rape them. Defense
attorneys suggested in a pretrial motion that the little orange
bottles are irrelevant novelty items, and the labels merely a joke.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics mogul Max Factor, is
accused of using drugs to incapacitate three women before raping them
at his beach house. He is charged with multiple counts of rape of
intoxicated and unconscious women, as well as sexual battery,
poisoning, sodomy and drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys maintain that Luster engaged in consensual sex
with the purported victims, whom they have portrayed as embarrassed
college coeds lying about the sexual encounters.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the bottles taken from Luster's home, Peterson
testified that investigators seized a video camera and 17 videotapes,
which allegedly depict Luster raping two unconscious women.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Santa Monica attorney Roger Jon Diamond
questioned Peterson at length about who handled the tapes, and where
and when they were booked as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The defense insists that rogue officers tampered with evidence and
conducted a dishonest investigation. However, Superior Court Judge
Ken Riley has found no evidence of police misconduct and limited
inquiry into it.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Diamond's questions on the handling of evidence,
Peterson said he seized the videotapes from a bedroom closet in
Luster's home, but was unaware of when the tapes were booked into the
sheriff's property room or who had access to them.</TE>
<TE>   During a lurching afternoon of stalled court proceedings and
countless objections by prosecutor Maeve Fox, Diamond pressed
Peterson about his knowledge of possible editing of the tapes. He
also questioned how the detective could know for certain the tapes he
removed from an evidence bag Wednesday were, in fact, the ones he
collected two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the tapes I collected," Peterson responded, telling the
jurors they would have to rely on his word.</TE>
<TE>   In other court developments, Carroll Dean Williams, a Ventura
resident and frequent critic of local law enforcement, was escorted
from the courtroom by deputies and barred from attending the trial
after allegedly contacting a juror.</TE>
<TE>   Williams denied the accusation, but Riley ordered him to remain 25
yards from any juror or risk being thrown in jail.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Planning Chief Quits Amid Crisis</HD>
<DH>Thomas B. Mathews' last day is Jan. 9, when 39 of 200
employees in his financially strapped department will lose their
jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco and Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's beleaguered planning director, faced with a financial
crisis in his department that has resulted in layoffs and a proposed
increase in building permit fees, announced Friday that he will
retire.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas B. Mathews, 59, is stepping down as the county grapples
with how to bring the department's budget into balance. Over the last
six months, the department has spent at least $8 million more than it
took in, and officials said it is operating at a deficit of up to $1
million a month.</LD>
<LD>   In his resignation letter, Mathews said "98.5%" of his nearly 30
years with the county were "rewarding personally and challenging
professionally." He also praised his staff for steady work during
difficult times.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to thank you all for your years of loyal service and to
assure everyone that I am proud of the work that we have performed
together, even under some of the most challenging of circumstances,"
he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   His last day is Jan. 9, when 39 of the 200 employees in his
department will lose their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The Planning Department's financial woes have their roots in a
sharp decline in development fee revenue over the last few years as
the local economy cooled down. Planners wrongly predicted building
would pick up, and critics say they didn't do enough to trim costs.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing Mathews' exit, County Executive Officer Michael
Schumacher released an "action plan" Wednesday to reorganize the
department, including an internal audit of its budget procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The county's auditor, David Sundstrom, will take over a study of
the department's fees to determine if they are accurately recovering
the costs of services -- the focus of an ongoing lawsuit against the
county alleging builders have been overcharged.</TE>
<TE>   Within the Planning Department, major purchases were suspended and
extra-help positions have been eliminated. Planners also are
"projecting future workloads to determine permanent resource needs"
-- a reference to allegations that the department has been
overstaffed for a county rapidly approaching build-out of its
unincorporated areas.</TE>
<TE>   The department will be temporarily supervised by Social Services
Agency Director Larry Leaman, who also announced his early retirement
Wednesday. He will return Jan. 10 to oversee the Planning Department
until a permanent director is hired. A third official, Registrar of
Voters Rosalyn Lever, will also retire Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad said Mathews
brought expertise to planning new communities and deserves
recognition despite the current financial crisis. She called Leaman a
good choice for interim director. "He's interested in new ideas, and
he listens. That's going to be an asset to the planning department."</TE>
<TE>   Former county administrator Ernie Schneider said Mathews was a
"terrific planning director." Schneider was chief of staff to former
Supervisor Bruce Nestande when he hired Mathews from the Planning
Department to become one of Nestande's executive assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews worked for two other former supervisors--the late Thomas
R. Riley and Roger R. Stanton--and was named director of the county's
Planning and Development Services Department in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Lynne Fishel, chief executive officer of the Building Industry
Assn. of Orange County, said Mathews "had a tough job balancing the
interests of the public and the development industry. Orange County
is better off for the projects he's worked on."</TE>
<TE>   But some slow-growth advocates said Mathews was too cozy with
developers.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that they get someone who can bring integrity to the
department and have no more backroom deals," said Richard Gomez of
the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews is taking advantage of an early-retirement package
approved Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors for some longtime county
managers. Supervisors agreed to a 3.75% pay bonus for early exits
from the planning and social services departments.</TE>

<HD>Mini-City Plan Near Palmdale May Be Revived</HD>
<DH>Texas company is seeking to buy and develop 7,400 acres of
Ritter Ranch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A land auction expected next month in U.S. Bankruptcy Court may
resurrect long-dormant plans to develop Ritter Ranch on the outskirts
of Palmdale, where a 20,000-resident mini-city was once planned.</LD>
<LD>   A Texas real estate company, RR Property Holdings LLC, is seeking
to buy the remaining 7,400 acres owned by Ritter Ranch Development
LLC, whose 1998 bankruptcy filing halted plans to build 7,000 homes
in the Leona Valley area.</LD>
<LD>   At least one other unnamed party is also interested in purchasing
the land, but under bankruptcy law will be required to top the Texas
company's $6.5-million offer by at least $500,000, officials
connected with the sale said.</LD>
<TE>   The Texas firm has indicated it would build on the property, but
has not said whether it would proceed with plans approved by Palmdale
in the early 1990s for a master-planned community, said attorney
Robbin Itkin, the court-appointed trustee for the bankruptcy
proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of RR Property Holdings said he did not know
whether the company would follow the existing plan or file a new one.
"I'm unaware of anything being ruled out," said attorney Bill
Freeman. "I think the city has to meet again and has to decide how
the property will be developed."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman declined to identify the principals in RR Property
Holdings, saying only that they are backed by an institutional
investor.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale Mayor James Ledford welcomed word of the pending sale: "I
think it's good news. The economy is ripe. The critical need for
housing is ripe."</TE>
<TE>   A master-planned housing community identical or similar to the one
already approved is the only development that could realistically
take place on the vast tract of land, Ledford said.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter Ranch originally covered more than 11,000 acres, but only
7,400 remain. When an early building phase was approved, about 4,200
acres were permanently deeded for parkland, even though construction
never took place.</TE>
<TE>   The original 11,000-acre parcel was put on the market for $27
million in 1988, when real estate was booming, and has changed hands
several times. The development's slide into foreclosure and
bankruptcy was attributed to the real estate market crash in the
early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Itkin said the Texas company has put down a large deposit, which
it will lose if it fails to go through with the purchase. U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Geraldine Mund is expected to set a
mid-January auction date during a hearing Friday or early next week.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for bankruptcy petitioner Ritter Ranch Development LLC
was unavailable for comment.</TE>

<LD>Travel executives said the nation's $91-billion foreign tourism
industry is in peril because of a growing perception overseas that
the United States has become "Fortress America."</LD>
<LD>   Travel industry executives complained that the post-Sept. 11
security crackdown at airports -- especially widely publicized
incidents in which visitors were searched, interrogated and put on a
plane back home -- has discouraged tourism.</LD>
<LD>   Travel to the United States was down 17% in the first six months
of 2002, according to the travel industry group.</LD>

<LD>Upset over street flooding that brought traffic to a halt this week,
City Council members Ruth Galanter and Alex Padilla called Wednesday
for a report in two weeks on what can be done to avoid future
standstills.</LD>
<LD>   Galanter and Padilla said traffic control was nonexistent after
flooding caused by rain left many motorists stranded Monday. The
report will be prepared by the city's chief legislative analyst with
assistance from police and fire officials.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly, the city should be able to anticipate flooding in
chronic problem areas and marshal a quick response," Galanter said.</LD>

<HD>Thousand Oaks City Council Issues Apologies</HD>
<DH>Resolution names an ex-councilwoman and two fired planners.
Panel, with a new majority, also extends law limiting housing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new Thousand Oaks City Council majority forced its political
agenda this week by issuing an apology to a slow-growth ally, further
limiting construction of new dwellings and reopening negotiations to
purchase and preserve vacant land near the Dos Vientos subdivision in
Newbury Park.</LD>
<LD>   The new majority Tuesday night approved on a 3-0 vote a written
apology to former Councilwoman Linda Parks and two fired planning
commissioners, as holdover council members Andy Fox and Dennis
Gillette sat silently and abstained from the vote.</LD>
<LD>   Fox and Gillette voted earlier this year to censure Parks, then a
candidate for county Board of Supervisors, after accusing her of
violating the state's open-meeting law by conferring illegally with
the two commissioners. A district attorney's investigation
subsequently cleared all three of wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   "I was disappointed they abstained," Councilman Ed Masry said.
"Frankly, I think they should have stepped up to the plate and voted
for it."</TE>
<TE>   Masry wrote the resolution calling for the apology and reversal of
the public record against Parks and former commissioners Michael
Farris and Nora Aidukas, who were dismissed in February.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope that what we did last night will prevent anybody from
doing it in the future, because they'll realize that what goes around
comes around," Masry said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the vote, a dozen speakers endorsed the apology as a way to
heal an old wound.</TE>
<TE>   "Correcting this wrong is the right move to make," resident Sheri
White, a teacher, said. White said she hoped that "by cleaning the
slate" the council would start the new year with a spirit of
collaboration and cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Aidukas told the council before its decision that she appreciated
the gesture. "No matter how the council votes tonight, I want to
thank Mr. Masry for providing this elegant means to shake hands, make
up and move on," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney advised the council to rewrite the final
paragraph of Masry's resolution, saying expunging the record by
defacing the minutes of the panel's Feb. 13 meeting would be a
felony. Instead, the language eventually approved stated the council
would "rescind, repeal and annul" Parks' censure.</TE>
<TE>   "I prefer expunging over the tamer version," Councilwoman Claudia
Bill-de la Pena said before her vote.</TE>
<TE>   Masry agreed with the revised language, but directed city lawyers
to review whether a minor change to his original resolution would
permit the record to be expunged without violating state law. The
matter could return to the council for a separate vote.</TE>
<TE>   The panel was unanimous in extending an ordinance that sets limits
on housing construction through 2007. The council halved the city's
yearly allotment to 250 dwellings, despite protests from development
interests.</TE>
<TE>   But the panel split on a proposal by Bill-de la Pena to reopen
negotiations with Operating Engineers Pension Trust, which owns 8.7
acres in Newbury Park that the new council majority wants to acquire
for permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for permission to build three luxury homes on the
site, the landowner earlier agreed to give the city $2.5 million to
help pay for an equestrian center on nearby public open space at
Rancho Potrero.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about the current council going through and trying
to undo the actions of previous councils. I'm drawing the line at
this project," Fox said. "It's good for the city of Thousand Oaks,
it's good for the equestrians and it's good for the people of Dos
Vientos" who want existing riding facilities in the area replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Despite protests by Fox and Gillette, the council voted 3 to 2 to
begin a new round of negotiations. Lawyer Mark C. Allen, who
represents Operating Engineers, said he had no comment.</TE>

<HD>Simi Valley Promotes New Police Chief From Ranks as
Glendale Hires Adams</HD>
<DH>Council decides against a nationwide search in naming Mark
Layhew, who worked his way up to captain in 27 years on the force, to
fill the post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes and Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley Police Chief Randy Adams will become Glendale's police
chief next month, and Capt. Mark Layhew has been named as Adams'
successor.</LD>
<LD>   As Simi Valley chief since 1995, Adams, 51, oversaw 120 officers
and 66 civilian employees. In recent years, the city has consistently
vied with Thousand Oaks as the nation's safest city with at least
100,000 residents.</LD>
<LD>   Previously, Adams served for 23 years in the Ventura Police
Department, as lieutenant, captain and then assistant chief.</LD>
<TE>   He holds master's degrees in management from Cal Poly Pomona and
administration of justice from Cal Lutheran University. He earned a
bachelor's degree in police science and administration from Cal State
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, who will assume the new post Jan. 31, replaces longtime
Chief Russell Siverling, who retired this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I am proud to be selected and look forward to joining the
Glendale Police Department and continuing to build on its fine
reputation," Adams said in a statement. He takes over a department
with 244 sworn officers and 114 civilian employees.</TE>
<TE>   Adams has served as president of the California Peace Officers
Assn. and graduated from the Peace Officer Standards and Training
Command College and the FBI National Academy.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate to see Randy go, but by the same token ... this is a good
move up for him," Simi Valley Mayor Bill Davis said Wednesday. "He's
done a really good job for us and obviously another police department
saw how good of an operation we have."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said that during 16 years on the City Council, several top
city officials have been lured away by larger cities and bigger
salaries. Since 1986, the city has had three different police chiefs,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we're a pretty good training ground for a lot of
different people," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Layhew, 50, is a prime example of that training, Davis said. The
incoming chief is so highly regarded by council members and police
colleagues that city leaders decided against the normal nationwide
search.</TE>
<TE>   Married and the father of two children, Layhew started with the
Simi Police Department in 1975 and worked his way through the ranks.
"It's very gratifying and good for the organization for people to
come in from the bottom step and make their way to the top," Layhew
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new chief said he has no plans for major changes, but will
take a broad look at aspects of the department.</TE>

<HD>Yorba Linda Officials to Parley With Developer</HD>
<DH>Though the council failed to delay home construction, the
two sides hope to work out issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Yorba Linda City Council may have failed in its attempt this week
to delay construction of 1,000 hillside homes, but that didn't stop
one council memberfrom saying Wednesday that city officials plan to
meet with the developer in hopes of negotiating amendments to the
plan.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes good business sense for [developer Shappell Industries]
to recognize that there's a new majority on this council that
recognizes how important it is to listen to the community and work
out neighborhood issues," said Councilman Ken Ryan, who had proposed
the ordinance to delay construction at least 45 days.</LD>
<LD>   Though three of the five council members voted for the measure, it
was an "urgency" action that required four votes for passage. The
ordinance, voted on late Tuesday after a long public hearing, would
have temporarily overturned a decision by the previous council.</LD>
<TE>   Beverly Hills-based Shappell had won approval of its plan about
1:30 a.m. on Nov. 6, just hours after the polls had closed on
election day.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan and at least one newly elected council member contend that
that original vote had been rushed. Tuesday's measure, Ryan said,
"would have bought us a little bit of time, and that's what everybody
was asking for."</TE>
<TE>   Even though it failed, he said, just having the item on the agenda
"caused a great deal of dialogue that I think is positive between
[Shappell] and the city."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said, city officials will meet with Shappell soon
to discuss such issues as density, design, park space and the
promised site for Yorba Linda's first high school.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the development, the previous council had voted to
amend the city's General Plan to eliminate open space in favor of new
homes, allow a major extension of Bastanchury Road and increase the
area's density from 300 to about 1,000 homes, including 385
apartments or townhomes for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides have indicated a willingness to talk about resolving
their differences," Assistant City Manager David Gruchow said
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Grand Visions Rise From Rubble</HD>
<DH>From world's tallest buildings to memorials on Hudson,
designs for WTC site are 'a preview of what Manhattan will look like
in 10 years.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Seven teams of internationally prestigious architects offered bold
proposals Wednesday to rebuild the World Trade Center site, ranging
from designs for the world's tallest buildings to memorial parks
floating in the Hudson River.</LD>
<LD>   As they discussed aesthetics and outlined plans for the 16-acre
site, some of the world's most famous architects also jousted over
which team was offering the best proposal for New York City and
America -- their presentations accompanied by rock music, spiritual
messages and flashy computer graphics.</LD>
<LD>   The provocative designs, four of which call for buildings taller
than the former World Trade Center's twin towers, were unveiled
before an overflow crowd at the Winter Garden, a large public atrium
across the street from where the towers once stood. The Lower
Manhattan Development Corp., a government agency that oversees
development at the site and sponsored the competition, is expected to
select a final design for the area in February. Agency officials
culled the seven teams of finalists from more than 407 entries this
year.</LD>
<TE>   "Some of these designs call on the traditions of 19th century
Europe, while others leap into the 21st century, and beyond," said
Roland Betts, an agency planner who helped direct the competition.</TE>
<TE>   "But they all address the same question: What do we want this site
to look like generations from now? Today's presentation is for the
visionaries," Betts said.</TE>
<TE>   The nine proposals reflect an astonishing range of human emotion
and spirituality, Betts added -- as if Rembrandt, Cezanne and Jasper
Johns were asked to paint the same building. When the final proposal
is picked next year, he said, officials will launch a separate
international competition for the design of a memorial at the site of
one of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   John Whitehead, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.,
praised the designs as "a preview of what Manhattan will look like in
10 years," and said the public will be invited to comment in two
public hearings, as well as on response cards that will be available
at the Winter Garden through Feb. 3. He also pledged that agency
officials will pick the final design -- or a combination of several
designs -- "in a spirit of real democracy."</TE>
<TE>   The architects who made 20-minute presentations Wednesday looked
and sounded as diverse as their proposals. Daniel Libeskind, the
German designer of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, was dressed all in
black and he lectured the audience intensely on what the site meant
to him. Norman Foster, a renowned London architect, came across as an
Oxford Don, talking about architecture and public need.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal vowed to restore the New York skyline, with
mega-buildings reminiscent of the doomed World Trade Center's towers.
Another called the site sacred ground, saying that commercial
buildings should take a back seat to public space honoring the Sept.
11 dead and the country's hope for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Although there were seven competing groups of architects, the
Think team -- with 10 partners, including architect Rafael Vinoly --
offered three proposals. Besides Libeskind and Foster, the other
finalists included a consortium led by Richard Meier, who designed
the Getty Center in Los Angeles; Peterson/Littenberg, a husband-wife
team based in New York; United Architects, led by Greg Lynn; and a
huge consortium headed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   While the issue of how to rebuild the site still triggers intense
disagreement, many observers believe that the presentations Wednesday
will revive public interest in what had become a sluggish, highly
technical debate. Six proposals unveiled last summer had been
strongly criticized for being unimaginative and were quickly
discarded by the development agency. The new designs got a much
better reception.</TE>
<TE>   The architects' often colorful pitches during the locally
televised three-hour event "brought us to a much better place, a more
thoughtful place about what we'll build," said Jack Lynch, a member
of the Coalition of 9-11 Families, whose firefighter son, Michael,
was killed at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of ideas we can work with here," added Mary
Fetchet, with the Voices of September 11 families group. "Some of the
ideas are quite good."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the discussion, however lofty, had its bare-knuckle moments.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the New York team, and some people call us the dream team,"
said Meier, introducing a team of his prestigious architects to the
audience. "But we're very real. This is our city, our home. It's
where our children grew up. All of this matters."</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, architect Steven Peterson said he and his wife,
Barbara Littenberg, are also from New York, and that "while [Meier's
group] might be the New York team, we're the New York project." He
said his proposal -- which called for immense twin towers -- would
restore local pride and fill a physical void in the city's spiritual
life.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about height -- which many expressed after the Sept. 11
attacks -- apparently were not a major issue, for the development
agency or for several of the competing firms. The agency set no
limits on height, and four of the proposals call for office space and
cultural uses on upper floors of buildings taller than the original
towers.</TE>
<TE>   Although many New Yorkers have said they would not want to work at
such heights in any new buildings in the area, newspaper polls have
found that 40% or more of respondents want the original twin towers
rebuilt and occupied as before. Currently, Malaysia's 1,483-foot
Petronas Twin Towers are the world's tallest buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not Dallas, and it's not Houston. It's the Big Apple, and
we want to bring back what was lost," Peterson said. "The towers
would be like a compass; you would always know where you are in
relation to them, and they'd be visible throughout New York."</TE>
<TE>   The proposals did not include cost estimates. Developer Larry
Silverstein, who has a 99-year lease to the trade center property, is
expected to finance any new buildings through a combination of bank
loans, insurance payments and tenant leases.</TE>
<TE>   All the proposals respected the so-called "footprints," or
physical locations, of the original towers, either by leaving the
space vacant or offering to construct noncommercial structures there.</TE>
<TE>   And the competing teams stressed that they were only offering
ideas for what memorials might look like on the site, given that a
separate competition for the memorial design would take precedence.</TE>
<TE>   But it was hard to separate the diverse ideas in the proposals
from the issue of a memorial. All spoke directly to the question of
what Sept. 11, 2001, meant, and how it might best be remembered by
future generations.</TE>
<TE>   Some proposals, such as the Libeskind design, highlighted the
physical depths of the site, vowing to preserve a portion of the
exposed bedrock foundation that now is all that remains of the twin
towers.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to journey down, some 70 feet into ground zero, onto the
foundation," he said. "The foundations withstood the unimaginable
trauma of the destruction and stand as eloquent as the Constitution
itself."</TE>
<TE>   Other designs sought to focus the human eye skyward, with memorial
parks built atop huge new buildings. Some proposals -- such as the
design offered by Meier's group, which includes memorial parks on the
Hudson -- would leave much of the site vacant, building on less than
27% of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Others sought to make grand architectural statements that would
tower above the city. Foster's group proposed to build immense, twin
towers connected at three points. He suggested that they would be the
"tallest, most physically secure and ecologically responsible
buildings in the world," but he didn't rely on words to make his
point.</TE>
<TE>   As graphics flashed on the screen, Foster told the hypothetical
story of a little girl who learns the story of Sept. 11 through the
architecture.</TE>
<TE>   She might visit the barren spaces for a memorial and ask, "Why is
this space empty?" he said. "And the mother would answer: 'It's not
empty, it's full of memories. And one day you'll understand.' " When
the child finally ascends to the top of the twin buildings with her
family, "she can look down into the void," he said, "where there is
no life, and see where it all started."</TE>
