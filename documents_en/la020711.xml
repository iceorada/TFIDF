<LD>Once again the most talked-about video in town is that of a white,
muscular cop appearing to beat a scrawny, unarmed black person. I say
appearing because things are not always what they seem. I ask you,
for instance, to consider the case of Officer Marion (Macho) Muscles
and the unpredictable Billy Skinny. Skinny, you might recall, was a
14-year-old African American caught by Officer Muscles stealing
nails. While being questioned, he resisted and was subdued with the
assistance of 17 other officers who had answered the call for backup.
As a result of Skinny's resistance, extra force was applied and he
later died of what was regarded as injuries suffered during the
subduction.</LD>
<LD>   An investigation followed, which included questioning by one
Officer Buck (Everyone's Buddy) Budson from the department's Internal
Affairs Division. I obtained audio tape excerpts from that
interrogation.</LD>
<LD>   Budson: Hey, Mach, how's it goin'? I haven't seen you since the
stag party!</LD>
<TE>   Muscles: Been busy, you know, "out huntin'."</TE>
<TE>   (Laughter)</TE>
<TE>   Budson: We got to talk about the... what was his name... yeah, the
Billy Skinny kid. Because he died in custody, you know, we got to
file the report.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Oh, sure, man, I understand.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: Starting from the beginning, why did you detain him in the
first place?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles (indignation): He was stealing! We can't have those people
just grabbing what don't belong to them.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: Those nails here in the report. Weren't they lying like in
the street in front of the hardware store?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles (seriously): They were in the perimeter of the store,
Buck. Sort of like coastal waters, you see? They were part of the
store.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: Oh, yeah, right. Tell me in your words what happened next.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Jeez, man, do we have to go through all this? (An
unintelligible mumble from Budson; Muscles sighs heavily.) OK, I stop
the kid and right away he sasses me.</TE>
<TE>   Budson (shuffling papers): It says here, Mach, that witnesses
testified the kid didn't say a word. Like nada.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Right! Silent sass is the worst kind! It sets a guy up!
You know what they're thinking by the look in their eyes! (A
half-whisper) It was savage.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: Hey, I never thought of that. You're right. Those people
want justice but they won't ask for it politely. (The slapping sound
of a high-five.) OK, go on.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: So I cuff the kid and I'm drag ... leading him to the car
when he starts resisting.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: I got to ask you, Mach. Skinny was mentally deficient. Did
he know what was going on?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Oh, he knew, Buck. That's the way it is with those nuts.
They have these superhuman powers to see things we don't, you know?</TE>
<TE>   Budson: Yeah, I read that in People magazine. So how did he
resist?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: The little (expletive) twitched!</TE>
<TE>   Budson: He twitched? You mean, like, he jerked or what?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: You know how when someone's about to fight you there's
kind of this small movement, like they're getting set?</TE>
<TE>   Budson: But wasn't he in cuffs?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Hey, Buck (laughing), you forget, he's got these
superhuman powers!</TE>
<TE>   Budson: Oh, yeah, right. That's when you called for backup?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Sure. The guy's beginning to glare too. That's another
sign that he's about to do something beyond this world.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: So he's twitching and glaring. It says here (paper
shuffling) that with some backup officers watching and others
helping, you lifted the suspect off the ground and slammed his head
against the patrol car hood. A lot of people think this might
constitute excessive police force, Mach.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Jeez, man, I told the chief, I was just trying to knock a
little sense into the dude's head before someone got hurt. The backup
guys were getting edgy.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: But it didn't stop him?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Stop him? Christ, no. He began making funny growling
sounds like deep in his throat and it scared hell out of me.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: But weren't you choking him at the time?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles (emphatically): I didn't choke nobody!</TE>
<TE>   Budson: But it says here ...</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: I put my hands around his throat to stop those dangerous
sounds. I was defending myself. That's when the damned fool died.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: Actually, Mach, he died after you punched him several
times in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Those weren't punches! I was applying pressure to start
his heart beating again. It's what do you call it artificial
perspiration.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: It says you were punching him in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: I was excited in this life-and-death situation and I
missed his chest.</TE>
<TE>   Budson: Aha. Then you were just trying to save his life in a
moment of extreme emotion after he suffered injuries while resisting
arrest, right?</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Exactly!</TE>
<TE>   Budson: It sounds OK to me, but there's going to have to be some
kind of punishment to please the public.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Sock it to me, pal.</TE>
<TE>   Budson (sighing): Sorry, Mach. No lunch hours for a week.</TE>
<TE>   Muscles: Oh, poor me!</TE>
<TE>   (Mock groaning, loud laughter, high-five slapping, a door slamming
and silence.)</TE>
<TE>   Later, at the behest of the police union, the chief reduced
Muscles' punishment to three days without lunch.</TE>

<LD>MURDER AT THE CONSPIRACY CONVENTION AND OTHER AMERICAN ABSURDITIES</LD>
<LD>   By Paul Krassner</LD>
<LD>   Barricade Books</LD>
<TE>   332 pages, $17.95</TE>
<TE>   Yippie, prankster, left-leaning realist, Paul Krassner is at it
again. The man who had lunch with John and Yoko, pulled gonzo tricks
with Ken Kesey, published the journal the Realist for decades and was
seen among more famous people of the 1950s and '60s than Forrest Gump
has put together a collection of more than 40 of his outrageous and
ribald essays in "Murder at the Conspiracy Convention and Other
American Absurdities." At a time when political correctness seems to
have drained humor from political discourse, his timing couldn't be
more perfect.</TE>
<TE>   But be forewarned: Krassner is an acquired taste. But how could it
be otherwise? This is the man who dropped a tab of LSD before going
on "The Tonight Show" in 1969. (Orson Bean was guest host that
night.) Perhaps it was this episode that inspired Johnny's catch
phrase, "That is weird schtuff."</TE>
<TE>   "Murder at the Conspiracy Convention" is no different, and
delightfully so. Clearly his years of hanging out with Lenny Bruce,
William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary and Abbie Hoffman
have influenced him, and certainly contributed to the rampant
paranoia that is strung through his writing. Erma Bom- beck is not
spoken here.</TE>
<TE>   But what goes around comes around. In the section "Defying
Conventions," Krassner describes how he became the recipient of other
people's paranoia. In 1981, knucklehead reactionary (and perpetual
presidential hopeful) Lyndon LaRouche published a dossier claiming
that Krassner, Burroughs, Bruce and Norman Mailer were recruited by
British intelligence's chief brainwashing facility, the Tavistock
Institute. Their alleged mission was to deride laws, morality and
decency with smut peddled in the name of humor and creative
expression. This would make Krassner a card-carrying member of the
vast left-wing conspiracy. (If you're a member of the vast right-
wing conspiracy, feel free to stop reading right now and alert John
Ashcroft.)</TE>
<TE>   While the book has a number of wacky (and whacked out)
recollections, there are some sweet ones, too.</TE>
<TE>   In the essay "Jerry Garcia and His Magic Shield," Krassner recalls
that in the late 1960s, Garcia brought him along to pay a call on a
friend who'd been in an extended funk. Garcia insisted the guy join a
side project he was starting. The fellow was David Nelson; the band
was New Riders of the Purple Sage, a Grateful Dead country-rock
offshoot that stayed together for more than a decade. Krassner notes
that when Garcia's health was failing, Nelson returned the favor by
visiting his mentor and encouraging him to play music to improve his
damaged body and spirit.</TE>
<TE>   When former Chicago Seven member Jerry Rubin became a Yuppie
businessman, he didn't always appreciate his radical days being
mentioned. This led Krass- ner to devise this cheeky headline:
"Former Yippie Leader Asks Not to Be Called Former Yippie Leader."</TE>
<TE>   Krassner is a wisecracker but also smart. In one essay, "Charlie
Manson's Image," he offers a novel dismissal of the view that Charles
Manson (who was his pen pal for a while) reflected badly on the
counterculture. Krassner observes that Manson was at heart just a
career criminal and that the real Manson family was the con artists,
pimps, drug dealers, thieves, muggers, rapists and murderers he met
during a youth spent behind bars. In many ways, Krassner was ahead of
his time. His career as a stand-up was "alternative comedy" before it
had a name.</TE>
<TE>   After the most famous Beat poet's picture appeared in an "Allen
Ginsberg Wore Khakis" ad, Krassner unsuccessfully lobbied the Gap to
use him as well. He reflected on this attempt by wondering, "Would I
be selling out, or would they be buying in?" That question, in a
nutshell, reveals the Paul Krassner wit and legacy which "Murder at
the Conspiracy Convention" captures so nicely.</TE>
<TE>   In "Allen Ginsberg's Last Laugh," he also recalls attending a
Yippie demonstration in Chicago in 1968 where Ginsberg inspired a
crowd of protesters being attacked by police to chant together. It's
a hallucinogenic tableau that perfectly sums up the decade's
leitmotifs of violence versus nirvana.</TE>
<TE>   Krassner provides an insider's view of those daring, dreamy,
druggy days. But they're over and--even if you wanted to--you can't
go om again.</TE>

<LD>If you haven't shopped for a vacuum cleaner since Aerosmith's "I
Don't Want to Miss a Thing" was sweeping the charts, you're in for a
surprise: Manufacturers have cleaned up their act in the last few
years.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, many vacuums would leave behind up to a third of the
dust and what was sucked up was stored in porous paper bags, which
become a new home for bacteria and allergens. No wonder the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency reports that indoor air can be more
polluted than what's outside.</LD>
<LD>   But now, even vacuums that sell for less than $100 have more
suction and come with filters that prevent dust particles from being
circulated back into the home. Washable filters have replaced paper
bags and additional filters "clean" the airflow that's exhaled from
the vacuum.</LD>
<TE>   Top-quality uprights and canisters have high-efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filters, which are used in hospitals and labs
to capture almost all of the dust mites, pollen spores and other
microorganisms (1,500 microscopic creatures can be crawling in a gram
of dust).</TE>
<TE>   Among the newest models is the $600 CleanSy vacuum by Zepter Inc.,
which has eight filters. Water--a natural filter--combines with
suction to collect the largest particles of dirt. HEPA and another
micro-filter capture the smallest particles. Two sponge filters keep
the dust from being released back into the air. An active carbon
filter, used in kitchen extractor fans, eliminates odors, and two
other filters prevent the typical "hot motor" vacuum smell. A
citrus-fragrance allergen inhibitor can be added to the water to
scent the air.</TE>
<TE>   The CleanSy, which is about the size of a computer monitor, can be
moved from room to room and used on carpet, furniture, drapes and
hard floors (wood, vinyl and other nonfabric floors and window
treatments are best for people with allergies and asthma because
they're easier to keep clean and aren't welcoming to mites).</TE>
<TE>   More information is available by calling (800) 253-2679 or
visiting www.cleansy.com.</TE>
<TE>   Another device that makes it easier to stand back (well, sort of)
and watch dirt disappear from your home is the new line of compact
steam cleaners that shampoo carpets and upholstery.</TE>
<TE>   Bissell's most popular model, the Little Green, has a new bubble
body (think of a miniature VW Beetle that maneuvers well on stairs).
But the machine, with its soft colors and round edges, does more than
look sporty. The tanks are easier to fill with hot tap water and a
cleaning solution than the old models, and they are quicker to empty
when the job is done. The smaller size makes it convenient to pull
out when a spill or accident happens.</TE>
<TE>   There are three canister models ($70-$100); the most expensive has
a rotating brush to tackle embedded dirt. For more information: (800)
237-7691; www.Bissell.com.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the clean scene: You're used to seeing Tide in the laundry
room, but for the first time, the brand is lending its
orange-yellow-and-blue bull's-eye logo to fashion to benefit the
Susan. G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Cynthia Rowley's nylon
bikini ($48), cotton trunks ($48) and cotton beach towels ($35) are
available online (www.tide.com) or later this month at the designer's
boutiques in New York City, East Hampton, N.Y., and Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Storm (and Culture) Warning</HD>
<DH>If another El Nino lands, watch it jump off weather pages
and into our psyches</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Nino last blew into town during that longest and grayest of
winters. Ever since that 1997-98 season, rumors have circulated that
another El Nino is on its way, the kind that could again hammer
Southern California with rain, topple hilltop homes in Malibu and
generally reshape life as we know it. "That's where the music from
'Jaws,' coupled with El Nino, comes in," joked Bill Patzert, an
oceanographic meteorologist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The last El Nino took on a California-centric persona that
transcended the climate here and became a cultural phenomenon. Since
the previous El Nino, when Patzert was interviewed by Dan Rather six
nights in a row, not a week has gone by without someone asking him
The Question: "In the end," he said, "what everybody wants to know
is, 'Is it coming?' "</LD>
<LD>   The buzz picked up in February, when federal scientists reported
that an El Nino is on its way, based on telltale signs such as an
unusual rise in the surface temperature of the equatorial Pacific
Ocean. This afternoon, scientists at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration are scheduled to issue an update on the
anticipated emergence of El Nino, the climate phenomenon that can
disrupt weather patterns worldwide. The update is expected to say
that a weak-to-moderate El Nino could hit the U.S. this winter.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, El Nino events, which occur every four to five years or
so, can have serious consequences. (The last El Nino caused an
estimated 24,000 deaths and $34 billion in damage worldwide.) But
locally, following the lightest rainfall season in the history of Los
Angeles, and with a heat wave underway, anticipation is building for
a repeat of the '97-98 winter, when most areas of the state got twice
as much rain as usual.</TE>
<TE>   This year's El Nino is not expected to be like the last one,
cautioned NOAA meteorologist John Janowiak. A "very strong" El Nino,
such as the one in 1997-98, would mean that California could expect
another unusually stormy winter, he said. But a weak or moderate El
Nino, which might not dominate the atmosphere, does not necessarily
mean a wetter winter for the state, he said.</TE>
<TE>   This winter's forecast, though, is not based solely on whether an
El Nino shows up and how strong it is; forecasters also will look to
climate patterns that can modify or lessen the effects of an El Nino.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the scientists say, local surfers don't hear much
beyond "El Nino," which, in its last appearance produced monstrous
waves, said Duke Edukas, co-owner of Surfside Sports in Newport
Beach. "Everybody talks about it," he said. "There's supposed to be
an El Nino. Mild or otherwise, it was a good time last time. It's
bound to be a good time [again]."</TE>
<TE>   Skiers have been buzzing with anticipation since January, said
Joani Lynch, communications manager at Mammoth Mountain. "El Nino,
whether or not there's a tag with it, mild or heavy or whatever, just
the mention of it brings up, 'Wet weather ... it must be ski time.' "
Last winter, Mammoth got about 330 inches of snow, which pales in
comparison with the 1997-98 total of 540 inches.</TE>
<TE>   The last El Nino unfairly became the scapegoat for every winter
storm in California, said Alexander Gershunov, an assistant project
scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Climate Research
Division in San Diego. An El Nino creates conditions in which rain is
more likely, but "you can't say one particular storm is due to El
Nino," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists can explain the way El Nino develops in the tropical
Pacific, but that doesn't stop locals from coming up with their own
theories. A couple of months ago, for instance, a surfer friend told
Gershunov how he knows that another El Nino is headed this way--the
shoreline, the surfer pointed out, is crowded with tiny red crabs,
the same kind that showed up during the 1997-98 season. (Scientists
say the mass stranding of crabs is not related to El Nino's arrival.)</TE>
<TE>   Even before El Nino showed up last time, it was hyped as "the
weather event of the century." "El Nino readiness is the newest
California craze," the Dallas Morning News reported in November 1997.
And then upon landing, El Nino was blamed for everything that
couldn't be pinned down. "If I didn't get the part, the show didn't
get picked up, the souffle didn't rise, well it's El Nino's fault,"
satirist Harry Shearer told "World News Tonight" that winter. "You
know, it's now the all-purpose Southern California excuse." News
media worldwide picked up on the story of the poor man named Al Nino,
a retired naval pilot in Nipomo, Calif., who was flooded with phone
calls from people who accused him of causing all sorts of problems,
weather-related and otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason that the last El Nino jumped off the weather
pages is its name, said Roger A. Pielke Jr., director of the Center
for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of
Colorado. The climate event was dubbed "El Nino" --or "the little
boy" in Spanish--by Peruvian fishermen, who noticed that the ocean
sometimes became warmer than usual around Christmas, when baby Jesus
was born. "The name itself becomes a symbol," Pielke said. "It takes
on much more than the event itself," with a distinct identity apart
from its physical characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   The last El Nino became wrapped into California's identity as
natural-disaster central, so that "we're at the frontier and battling
the elements on a regular basis," said Marita Sturken, an associate
professor at USC's Annenberg School for Communication. "I think it
plays into people's sense of a kind of rugged landscape in a way that
mediates the idea that we have everything very easy and everything
here is sort of without meaning," said Sturken, who wrote a September
1998 paper called "Desiring the Weather: El Nino, the Media, and
California Identity."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to say, she said, how another El Nino would play on the
psyche. "I think people have had a lot of awful news this year. It
might be a relief for people to have something as kind of untroubling
as a messy winter."</TE>

<HD>Beyond the Bouquet</HD>
<DH>L.A. florists put their mettle to the petal in an ongoing
contest to create cutting-edge arrangements</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A studio head wants to send his big box-office star flowers after her
newest movie rakes in $75 million over the weekend. Think a dozen
long-stemmed roses will do it? Forget it. You might as well send
smiley-face balloons and a Whitman's Sampler.</LD>
<LD>   In a city where appearances count, floral design has become an
ultra-competitive, big-bucks (average arrangement $100; no upper
limit), high-stakes business with constant pressure to come up with
traffic-stopping, cutting-edge designs. While sending the snapdragon
and carnation bouquet from Page 7 of the generic flower arrangement
catalog may work for some, others consider nothing but flora in the
highest possible style.</LD>
<LD>   For one man's 40th birthday party lavender-blue hydrangeas and
velvety chocolate cosmos were placed in containers wrapped with faux
fur. Centerpieces for the 2000 Academy Award Governors Ball included
cymbidium orchids submerged in a glass bowl filled with broken glass,
water and a 2-inch layer of red oil. At the recent gala opening for
the Andy Warhol retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art,
vibrant gerbera daisies were placed in glass vases that had been
painted on the inside in similar hot colors, mimicking Warhol hues.</LD>
<TE>   A simple candelabrum went haute couture for one party when it was
covered with moss and decorated with a spiral of artichokes, protea,
oranges, apples, succulents and silver beads. For another, rows of
white hyacinths were placed in a square steel planter lined with
broken glass.</TE>
<TE>   Rose aficionados who turn their noses up at contrived bouquets
with baby's breath and ferns can opt for 100 roses standing straight
up in a low box, tied together with crisscrossed branches and
accented with more roses and greenery at the bottom. If
congratulations are in order, how about a bottle of champagne placed
in a cylindrical glass vase topped with a lush bouquet--an effect
that makes the flowers look as though they're floating? Or, for a
more modern, minimalist look, perhaps a submerged single orchid,
roots exposed, in a pebble-filled glass vase framed with bamboo
stalks and curly willow?</TE>
<TE>   National Attention</TE>
<TE>   These arrangements are not only decorating glitzy Hollywood
parties, million-dollar weddings, chic restaurants and elaborate bar
and bat mitzvah celebrations, but are also getting national attention
by showing up in splashy spreads in magazines and on television
shows. With florists turning out 100 to 200 arrangements in one day
and booking events months in advance, there is no such thing as down
time. Some shops employ as many as 16 full-time designers with
backgrounds in everything from fine art to fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "In L.A. everyone is always looking for the newest restaurant, the
newest thing," says Mark Held, co-owner of Mark's Garden in Sherman
Oaks. "It's true for flowers, too. You have to be creating something
new every day to stay ahead; otherwise you're not in the swim of it."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever a client wants a client will get, from spare,
Asian-influenced designs to ceiling-high creations bursting with
dramatic sprays of flowers and foliage. Some florists even do table
settings and lighting and construct elaborate props for parties and
other events.</TE>
<TE>   Those on the receiving end of amazing bouquets don't easily forget
them. Amanda Selby, a 25-year-old Los Angeles student, was sent
arrangements from Mark's Garden of lavender and pink roses and white
tulips in cylindrical glass vases for a wedding shower she threw for
a friend. "They were so beautiful," she says. "We were thrilled. They
were the first thing people noticed when they came into the house.
And they were a little different than I had seen before, with the
tulips taller than the roses. It was sort of a modern take on a
traditional look."</TE>
<TE>   Floral displays "make this a better workplace," says Michael
Jacobson, manager of Neil Lane Jewelry in L.A., which often orders
arrangements from Casabella Florist in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Clients often come up with their own ideas, which floral designers
build upon. Hostess Lucy Billett wanted flowers to play a minimal
role in the centerpieces for her son's recent wedding rehearsal
dinner. Mark's Garden obliged by taking fruit such as kumquats and
pears and lightly bronzing them, then adding one or two roses to the
arrangements. For the wedding they created cufflinks and a dickey out
of rosebuds for Billet's suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Flowers," she says, "bring life. They set a mood."</TE>
<TE>   Floral Trends</TE>
<TE>   As there are trends in fashion and home decor, so there are in
floral arrangements, colors of flowers and kinds of flowers. On the
"in" list now, according to Held, are "crazy" mixtures of hot pinks,
oranges and acid greens as well as autumnal tones of burgundy and
rust; huge dahlias the size of dinner plates; unusual bicolor roses
in dusty shades of terra cotta or bright citrus; fragrant herbs such
as rosemary used as accents in arrangements; bright chartreuse
foliage; and swirly, fuzzy cockscomb. Held and partner Richard David
predict that ballerina pink will see a big comeback soon.</TE>
<TE>   On the passe list at Casabella are lush garden basket arrangements
that look as though the flowers came from backyard cuttings. So is
adding fruit to arrangements. A more modern look is being asked for,
says owner Stacy Gray, incorporating Zen-like designs in glass vases
that draw attention to the container as well as the flowers. "I like
playing with the water at different levels," says Gray. A favorite
design entails placing a tied bouquet or a single dramatic flower,
such as protea, in a pebble or broken glass-lined container and
adding only an inch of water. She also wraps the inside of glass
vases with leaves, or wraps the outside with raw silk to add
vibrancy.</TE>
<TE>   Brides are even venturing away from traditional bouquets of pale
pink roses and opting for colored calla lilies, burgundy and
chartreuse color schemes and bouquets of all one flower, such as
vibrant parrot tulips. "Brides have become so much more adventurous,"
says Walter Hubert, owner of Silver Birches in Pasadena. For one
Jewish wedding he created a chuppa (the canopy under which the bride
and groom stand) out of braided grasses and a carpet of glossy galax
leaves. And while most florists turn their noses up at prosaic baby's
breath, Hubert did an entire wedding in baby's breath, including
centerpieces and bridal bouquet.</TE>
<TE>   For floral designers, inspiration for designs and trends come from
all points.</TE>
<TE>   Hubert observes what people are wearing, how they're decorating
their homes and what movies they're watching. He's keeping a close
eye on new animated films that use nontraditional colors "that didn't
exist 15 years ago, a whole new range of palettes." He also soaks up
useful information from casual conversations at parties: "I'll be
talking to people about what they're doing and where they're going
and all of a sudden I'll realize, these people don't want
[arrangements in] baskets. They're beyond that."</TE>
<TE>   Gray of Casabella says peeking at stunning Beverly Hills gardens
can inspire new designs, as can a museum exhibition of Van Gogh
works. "And sometimes," she adds, "I'll be dreaming and something
comes to me and I'll tell my designers and we'll see if it works."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Yamagata, manager and floral designer at the Empty Vase in
West Hollywood, voraciously reads newspapers and shelter and fashion
magazines, but also finds ideas in store window displays. Adds shop
owner Saeed Babaeean, "We're in a neighborhood with antiques stores
and design studios--that helps a lot. It makes it easier to be
creative."</TE>
<TE>   Babaeean also finds inspiration in the flowers themselves: "If you
look at them really carefully," he says, "they'll tell you what you
should do with them. I don't plan the designing in advance. Each
flower will tell you how to use it."</TE>

<LD>Firestorms</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever heard of a firestorm? It is the most destructive
type of wildfire--so powerful it makes a roaring sound and can
generate winds of up to 65 mph. Recently firestorms have raged in
Southern California and elsewhere in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Wildfires are a part of the natural environment. Fire is a process
that removes dead brush and enriches the soil. Some seeds need fire
to sprout and some plants only bloom after fires. Native Americans
used fire to increase the productivity of the land and as an aid in
hunting animals. Early settlers used fire to clear land for farming
and ranching.</LD>
<TE>   Though some fires are started by lightning strikes, most fires
today are started by humans, either accidentally or on purpose. Our
local foothills and mountains are especially dry at this time of
year. They are covered with plants that can easily burn. Does your
family have a plan for what to do in case of a fire? If you live in
the foothills, it is important to clear away brush close to your
home. You should also get rid of anything that can catch fire easily.
For more information, contact your local fire department or the
American Red Cross,
www.redcross.org/services/disaster/keepsafe/readyfire.html.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA Stunt Ranch Reserve is a 310-acre site homesteaded by the
Stunt family in 1885. During the 1993 Malibu/Calabasas firestorm, all
its facilities burned. Plans are underway to rebuild the education
and nature center, but you can take part in one of the environmental
programs offered by the Cold Creek Docents. Tours of the reserve can
be booked by calling (818) 346-9675, Ext. 343. For free curriculum
guides and information on the Stunt Ranch Reserve, visit
nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/stunt.html or call (310) 206-3887.</TE>

<HD>Ms. Finds Some Muscle</HD>
<DH>New editor hopes to bring a harder edge and broader focus</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As carpenters hammered and drilled away in Ms. magazine's
not-yet-finished Beverly Hills offices, Tracy Wood--named this week
the publication's new editor in chief--sat down to talk about the
future of the often-struggling feminist publication co-founded in
1972 by Gloria Steinem.</LD>
<LD>   Given that Wood is a former investigative journalist for The Times
and the Orange County Register, it is no surprise that she intends to
pursue hard-edged stories. "I'm a news person," she says. "I'm not
fluffy."</LD>
<LD>   She speaks of investigative stories that "will have an immediate
focus on women, but a larger focus on society as a whole. There are
some obvious areas. All you have to do is look at the Taliban. Right
away they went after women. Wherever that happens, there has to be a
voice that's not afraid and speaks very clearly and has a wide
audience."</LD>
<TE>   She wants Ms. stories to expose wrongdoing and to spur reactions
"that protect women from those kinds of overt abuses." Further, Wood
says, the magazine--which last year was bought by the Feminist
Majority Foundation and is now operating as a nonprofit--will
"absolutely" have more of an international focus, with a regular
world section under the direction of an editor "very experienced in
world affairs," not necessarily an American journalist, but "somebody
to help us keep track of all the major things that affect women--such
as world slavery--and put them in context."</TE>
<TE>   Wood, who grew up in Fanwood, a small New Jersey town, knew early
on that she wanted to be a foreign correspondent. So off she went to
the University of Missouri to study journalism--and was persuaded by
CBS correspondents visiting the university to opt instead for a
broader curriculum. She wound up with a dual major in economic
geography and religious philosophy but left college at the end of
three years when a summer job at City News Service in Los Angeles,
where her parents had relocated, led to a permanent job offer.</TE>
<TE>   She then joined the UPI news agency, which sent her to Sacramento
and New York and, in the spring of 1972, to Vietnam as a combat
correspondent. She has chronicled her experiences there in a book,
"War Torn: Stories of War From the Women Reporters Who Covered
Vietnam," to be published in August by Random House. It is a
compilation of the stories of nine women who covered that war from
"before it was even on people's horizon up through the last emergency
helicopter evacuation."</TE>
<TE>   Her chapter, Wood says, is titled "Spies, Lovers and Prisoners of
War," which "kind of sums it up. It covers how I got there, which was
over the objections of the foreign editor, who did not want to send a
woman, and my introduction to combat. We were all in our 20s, and
virtually none of us had any combat experience. We learned on the
scene how to cover a war and learned firsthand what death looks like
close up."</TE>
<TE>   It was a defining moment in her life, "my coming of age. There's a
part of you that wishes you never had gone because it hardens you,
but life hardens people one way or another." Wood covered the arrival
in Saigon of the Viet Cong and the release of the American prisoners
of war in Hanoi.</TE>
<TE>   It is that background in hard news that she will bring to Ms. She
is reluctant to talk about specific stories that will run in the Oct.
1 issue, the first under her stewardship, for fear of being scooped.
But she promises that Ms. will cover everything from sports to
current events and that "even the features will have a news edge."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the magazine's shaky financial history, Wood says, she
jumped at the chance to be editor. "If you're an investigative person
and a woman, it's almost like they created the job for me." But she
said her hard-news orientation does not preclude publication of
fiction and poetry, as has been traditional. Some of the issues Ms.
will continue to address are ones it tackled 30 years ago. Domestic
violence, for example, has not gone away, Wood says, but "today there
are places for women to go" so it's no longer a matter of being "out
there banging on walls" to call attention to the problem. Rather, "we
have to look at what still needs to be done, and we also have to
support what has been done."</TE>
<TE>   The anti-abortion forces are going to be fighting "till their last
breath," Wood says--just as Ms. will be fighting for a woman's right
to choose. "There's no change there."</TE>
<TE>   Workplace issues still need to be resolved. In her generation,
says Wood, who is in her 50s, "we made choices" within an imperfect
system. But today's young women often are trying to figure out how
not to lose ground in the career race without shortchanging their
husbands, children and themselves. "Child care is still a massive
issue." Wood hopes this type of story will attract the young readers
it seeks. (She estimates the magazine's average reader is between 35
and 50).</TE>
<TE>   Wood, who never married, says she realized she was not one of
those women who can have it all and do everything equally well. "I
looked at marriage as a genuine commitment, and I never wanted to
shortchange either my husband or children."</TE>
<TE>   She lives in Fullerton, where she is on the vestry of St. Andrew's
Episcopal Church. She enjoys sailing and camping but, she says, "I'm
not one of those 'see how fast I can get to the top of this hill'
types. I like to sit under the trees and enjoy the trees and the
sky." Basically, she says, "I'm a quiet person. I'm a reader," as
well as a writer. She is working now on a novel centered on a murder.</TE>
<TE>   Ms., the first national circulation magazine to come out of the
women's movement, claimed at its peak in 1976 a paid circulation of
500,000. But early on it found itself in conflict content-wise and
philosophically with its advertisers, notably losing a
$250,000-a-year Philip Morris account for balking at the company's
"You've Come a Long Way, Baby" campaign for Virginia Slims. The
magazine felt the ads infantilized women and bristled at the
depiction of smoking as a sign of women's progress.</TE>
<TE>   For almost a decade, starting in 1979, Ms. published as a
nonprofit under the aegis of the Ms. Foundation for Education. It
then was sold twice before being relaunched in 1990 as an ad-free,
reader-supported publication. Six years later, it was purchased by
MacDonald Communications, which published Working Mother and the
now-defunct Working Woman. The fit was not a good one, and
publication of Ms. was suspended in 1998. To save the magazine, a
consortium of feminists, including Steinem, bought it. It was Steinem
who last summer proposed selling it to the Feminist Majority
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Foundation president Eleanor Smeal had some initial concerns.
Among them: that those who fund specific foundation projects would
think their money was going to the magazine. The foundation, a
leading feminist research and action organization--boosted by a
$10-million endowment from Peg Yorkin of Los Angeles--has used its
funding to campaign against gender apartheid in Afghanistan and to
bring the abortion pill mifepristone (formerly known as RU-486) to
the United States. Still, Smeal says, "we wanted to keep this
independent feminist voice," so the foundation decided to buy the
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Ms., Smeal says, "the thing we want to do for sure is to
make news. We want to have freelancers and stringers, feminists from
abroad, contributing regularly, so we can cover areas that are hot
from a feminist perspective" and before they are picked up in the
mainstream media.</TE>
<TE>   The mission of Ms. has changed in the last 30 years, Smeal says,
in that "the movement has so matured and there are a huge number of
women's-rights organizations and feminist organizations worldwide. We
want people to know who's doing what, taking action, and to empower
people."</TE>
<TE>   Through its affiliation with the Feminist Majority Foundation,
which has offices in Arlington, Va., as well as Beverly Hills, Ms.
gains considerable resources, including a medical expert and a global
research department. And, by moving from costly Manhattan offices to
space shared with the foundation (once home to the Beverly Hills
Bridge Club--"Is that a hoot?" laughs Yorkin, who bought the
building) there is a significant financial savings. With a combined
newsstand and subscription circulation of about 110,000, Wood says,
"we're close to breaking even. But we're going to have to increase
those [numbers] substantially. We have to grow in order to finance
some of the things we want to do down the road," including costly
investigative reporting. The foundation will take up the slack,
certainly for the first year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to get some other partners," Smeal says. "We're
looking for foundation funding. We'd like to partner with a group,
for example, that's interested in environmental news, to cover
eco-feminism issues on a regular basis." The Ford Foundation has
given $50,000 to help set up the world reporting desk.</TE>
<TE>   Steinem remains involved as a consulting editor. It was she who
wrote a letter sent in mid-February to Ms. subscribers with a new
approach, an invitation to become a member of the Ms. community by
giving to an investigative fund or perhaps buying subscriptions for
women in prison or for women's-studies programs. The response, Smeal
says, was "tremendous. The average gift is way above the subscription
[cost]" of $25 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. will resume publishing every other month starting in January.
There are plans to open a bureau in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Wood wants Ms. to be an "inclusive" magazine, one that will
consider printing "intelligent discussion," even of opposing views.
"If they want to discuss [issues] in a civil way, then I'm open to
it. I speak softly. I don't run over people."</TE>
<TE>   Does she, perhaps, think the Ms. of years past was a bit too
strident? "I think there were times when probably Ms. could not be
strident enough," she says. "But, like a car, you don't always drive
it in fifth gear."</TE>

<LD>Inside the little house on the elephant's back Brian and Heather
snuggled into their pillow nests and held on tight.</LD>
<LD>   "Look," Heather said. She pointed at Alexandra, who was now
smiling broadly and wearing purple tights. She stood on the float
waving at the nonexistent crowd just like the acrobats and
aerialists.</LD>
<LD>   The houses on either side of the street got smaller and more like
the cottages in fairy tales. Trees grew taller and more gnarled until
the parade was no longer marching along a city street but along a
path through a wilderness.</LD>
<TE>   "Where are we going?" Heather called down to Major Pimm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm taking you home, of course," Major Pimm called over his
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "Home?" Brian exclaimed. "How do you know where we live?"</TE>
<TE>   "You wished on the sticks, didn't you?"</TE>
<TE>   This didn't seem to be much of an answer at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you afraid?" Heather whispered to Brian.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Brian said. "Not afraid, exactly. Let's just say I'm very,
very interested in seeing what happens next."</TE>
<TE>   Heather nodded.</TE>
<TE>   As they traveled the houses got smaller but the flowers got bigger
and more colorful. Little men with long black beards peeked out from
inside the flowers and waved. Brian and Heather, like Alexandra and
all the circus folk, waved back.</TE>
<TE>   The trees got taller and taller, and closer and closer together.
Soon, Brian and Heather were traveling along in darkness lighted only
by an occasional light hanging among the high tree branches. One of
the lights swooped down at them. It was a glowing lady no bigger than
Heather's thumb. She blew each of them a kiss and then swooped away.</TE>
<TE>   After that the lights got farther and farther apart, until the
darkness was complete.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't look like home to me," Heather said softly.</TE>
<TE>   Brian could only agree. He couldn't tell whether his eyes were
open or closed.</TE>

<HD>Teen Leaders Answer a Conference Call</HD>
<DH>Students well versed in world events join a D.C. confab and
wrestle with current issues</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most American teenagers know more about the personal lives of their
favorite celebrities than they do about the policies of President
Bush. They watch MTV (not CNN), listen to KROQ (not NPR) and read
teen magazines instead of the newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there are some high school students whose interest in
diplomacy extends beyond deciding which is the best party to attend
on a Friday night. Well informed of world events and actively
interested in the political process, about 350 of them will be
learning even more at the National Young Leaders Conference that
began this week in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Students like Deena Quitman--a 16-year-old at Huntington Beach
High School who wants to be a lawyer, maybe even president
someday--and Jeremy Blatter, a 17-year-old "general truth seeker"
from Santa Barbara whose distrust of the mainstream media has led him
to read Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and the Nation.</LD>
<TE>   Handpicked by their teachers, students are selected for their
leadership ability. This year, 37 California students are attending
the 11-day conference, hosted by the Congressional Youth Leadership
Council, a Washington-based nonprofit founded in 1985 by an educator
and a congressional staffer who wanted to tie education into
government and leadership. Cost of attending, about $2,000 per
person, is paid either by the student's family or is covered by a
scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   Though the curriculum changes each year to reflect current events,
this year, during the "If I Were President" simulation, they're
responding to an international crisis involving North Korea, spy
satellites, nuclear arms and the Persian Gulf. In a mock
congressional session, they are debating legislation on education,
homeland security and spending initiatives. And in a judicial
simulation called "Testing the Constitution" they are arguing real
court cases involving a school board's liability for sexual
harassment between students and whether law enforcement officials
violate the 4th Amendment by allowing the news media to tag along.</TE>
<TE>   Students also have the opportunity to meet with senators and
representatives from their area, oftentimes one on one. Last year,
two students from Iowa not only met with their representative but
Bono of the rock group U2 while the two discussed global debt relief.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to meet people in Washington," said Natasha Spann, a
breathless 15-year-old from Torrance who is participating in this
year's conference. An avid news watcher, she said she knows
California's representatives by sight but not by name. "I want to
know firsthand what they think. Maybe someday someone will remember
me and say, 'Hey, come over here.' "</TE>
<TE>   So far, none of the alumni from the National Young Leaders
Conference have gone on to political office, though some now work on
Capitol Hill. Perhaps the program's most notable alumnus is Nick
Irons, from Rockville, Md. In 1997, at age 25, he swam the length of
the Mississippi River and raised $200,000 for research into multiple
sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, he rode his bicycle 10,000 miles for the same cause and
raised $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a member of Congress, but maybe someday he will be,"
said program spokesman Brett West. "At this point he's taking on his
own role as a leader, and that's what we really encourage in people."</TE>
<TE>   Between the ages of 15 and 17, few of the participating students
know what they want to study in college, let alone what they want to
do once they're out in the real world. But they share an awareness of
the problems their generation will face in the future and hope to be
involved in their resolution.</TE>
<TE>   What will be their greatest political challenges down the road?</TE>
<TE>   According to Ashlyn Kotani, a 16-year-old from Torrance at this
year's conference, it's education. "We need teachers that actually
know what they're doing and more individual attention," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To Gershom Gannon-O'Gara, 16, of Culver City, foreign policy is a
concern. "It's all about how many enemies we make in Europe right
now. We're sort of blundering around, and we're not making any
friends....</TE>
<TE>   "In Europe, when the next generation of politicians come out, my
opinion is they're going to be fairly radical and openly opposed to
the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Quitman thinks the tensions between Israelis and Palestinians will
continue to be a volatile issue. "We're hoping if a Palestinian state
is created and peace is reached that it'll be over, but I think
that's highly idealistic. [It's] going to be an issue for a very,
very long time."</TE>
<TE>   Quitman is more politically involved than most other people her
age. She participates in her school's Model U.N. program, a
debate-type club where students argue different countries' positions.</TE>
<TE>   She's also a member of her school's site council--a group of
parents, teachers and students that determines where school funds
should be allocated--and is vice president of her youth group.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes to go to Brown University when she graduates next year
and major in economics. From there, she will study law, possibly
using that as a springboard to pursue a career in politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're going to see a female president some time in the
near future," she said, "but if that female president doesn't come
before my time, then who knows? Maybe it will be me."</TE>

<LD>"There's gum on the hammer and gum on the broom/And gum on the
milkman's shoe.... " From "American Gum," by Dan Crow.</LD>
<LD>   Singer-songwriter Dan Crow is silly. And sneaky. For more than 25
years, this former educator has been making kids laugh with wacky
songs and stories that are actually language lessons in disguise.</LD>
<LD>   With his crinkly grin lines, Harpo Marx-ish comic expressions and
childlike exuberance--"I'm 55, but I'm really still 11," he
says--Crow turns letter sounds and grammar lessons into zany tales
about joking giants; sandwich-eating witches with itches; kissable
cows; and bubble-gum trouble.</LD>
<TE>   Guitar in hand, he tours nearly 11 months of the year across the
United States and overseas, alone or with veteran musicians Dennis
O'Hanlon and Fred Sokolow; upcoming local stops include concerts
Sunday at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum and July 24 at Descanso
Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to get young people excited about words and language
and communication," Crow said from his Palm Springs home base.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get 'em excited about words, then they're gonna be excited
about reading, and then they're going to be excited about writing and
being creative and expressing themselves better."</TE>
<TE>   A speech therapist in the mid-1970s in Appalachian Virginia, Crow
began writing songs to help his students more readily grasp language
arts and vocabulary development. "It was like using a jingle to sell
a hamburger," he said. "I was selling basic skills and educational
concepts."</TE>
<TE>   Influenced by the music and storytelling he heard "in the hollers"
of Virginia and later in Montana, where he worked with Native
American children, Crow honed his own storytelling style. An
accomplished acoustic guitarist, his repertoire includes songs and
poems that he wrote as an 11-year-old with his first guitar ("I could
play two chords") and a passion for words, especially funny ones.</TE>
<TE>   He took his act on the road in the late 1970s. Since then, Crow,
while not a household name, has made a comfortable living, unlike
many children's artists. He's augmented concert bookings with
extensive work for Disney as writer, director and producer of
educational video and film-strip programs, and as staff songwriter
for the preschooler TV shows "Welcome to Pooh Corner" and "Dumbo's
Circus."</TE>
<TE>   Riding the currents of an ever-changing fan base--"The children's
music biz is so peculiar; you're essentially rediscovered every five
or six years by new kids and parents"--Crow has his own label, Alls
House Family Entertainment, and his Web site is busy with CD sales
and bookings.</TE>
<TE>   In performance, Crow's unforced, big brother-ish joviality is key
to winning new fans. Playing his guitar, he goofily serves up such
sing-along signature songs as "Oops," "Kiss a Cow" and "I Had Ham"
and sparks giggles of recognition with comic tales of his own
childhood misadventures.</TE>
<TE>   His songs are a staple of English as a Second Language programs in
Japan, Germany, Spain and South and Central America. He tours at
overseas Dept. of Defense Dependent Schools on U.S. military bases,
something that took on new meaning after Sept. 11. He was in Germany
last December, performing for children whose parents were shipping
out on active duty.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the one that really got me," he said. "The kids were so
hungry to be entertained and to laugh--mainly to laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Judith Mayo, a DoDDS principal in Germany, considers Crow a find,
booking him regularly.</TE>
<TE>   "His ability to quickly gauge the needs of each audience and adapt
his performance in such a way that he has adults and children smiling
and joining in the fun," she said, "is what makes him such an
excellent teacher. The kids don't even realize they're learning
something new. It's a real gift."</TE>

<HD>Blowing the Cover Off Nightspots' New Trend</HD>
<DH>Some dance clubs such as Free Thinking are cashing in by
eliminating their admission fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOMMY NGUYEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A window near the entrance of Free Thinking, a Friday night club at
Boardner's in Hollywood, invites patrons to peek inside. It's fairly
dark on the dance floor, but the lively silhouettes of raised hands
and bumping shoulders are unmistakable. So is the house music--for
many, it's the first sound of the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, two bars, a comfy upstairs lounge and an outdoor patio
filled with a fashionably urban crowd complete the night-on-the-town
effect, with an inspired DJ in the middle of it all. Free Thinking is
all you'd expect from a weekend dance club, except for one thing:
There's no cover charge.</LD>
<LD>   That mind-set is appreciated by many of L.A.' maturing scenesters.
"I've been dancing since I was 17, paying a lot of money to get into
raves and clubs, so I think I've paid my dues," says Akiko Yamaguchi,
24. "Now, if I'm not on the guest list, I just don't see the point in
paying $15 or $20 just to hang out with friends, have a few drinks
and maybe dance a little."</LD>
<TE>   Big weekend club nights like Friday's Red and Saturday's Spundae
routinely demand $20 covers; Giant will charge even more for a
one-off event. Even some traditionally $10 weekday dancing hotspots,
like Bossa:Nova at Sugar and Deep at sixteen-fifty, have been pushing
$15. That's probably no big deal for someone who goes out a few times
a month. But it adds up for those who go clubbing several times a
week.</TE>
<TE>   Yamaguchi is part of that burgeoning latter group--post-rave
clubgoers who've become jaded by the expensive routine of finding a
dance floor, but who still love to dance. Sure, she'll still pay good
money to hear a top-name DJ, though her own list of top-name DJs has
shortened considerably as she's gotten older. According to the club's
promoters, this is why Free Thinking--which gives up-and-coming local
DJs exposure--makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   "There will always be big DJs out there who are worth that
amount," says Cade, whose club stays open by bringing in a minimum
bar revenue for Boardner's each week. "What we're trying to do is
bring something different that everyone can enjoy, including that
person who says, 'All I have is six bucks tonight.' Well, here,
that's enough for a beer, and you can dance as well."</TE>
<TE>   That's music to the ears of clubgoers like Steve Turzo. "The
covers just aren't worth it," he says. On weekends, the Hollywood
resident usually heads to the bars--an increasingly popular
alternative as more rock 'n' roll jukeboxes are replaced by dance and
urban music DJs, who fill up bars' cozy but workable dance spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "This bar is a dance place," says Johnny Nixon, owner of Star
Shoes. As in many bars, the dance space is small, but patrons even
off the dance floor make the most of the DJ's vinyls by grooving in
place or chilling in the pretty disco-ball ambience. "I can charge a
cover, but I won't," says Nixon. "It just cuts off people who should
be in here."</TE>
<TE>   DJ Tony Watson hopes clubgoers aren't too determined to avoid
covers. Often, the money isn't going to big-time promoters or the
venue's corporate owners; It's paying the DJ. "This is my livelihood,
it's what I do for a living," says Watson, a resident of More
(Fridays at Gabah), which charges $10. "I think charging a cover is
fair because it allows me to share my passion for music."</TE>
<TE>   And even if there isn't a cover, that doesn't mean you won't drop
some bills at these places. "But I'd rather you spend the money at
the bar than at the door, and drinks aren't cheap," says Rusty
Updegraff, general manager of 360.</TE>
<TE>   Before it closed for repairs last year, Updegraff's penthouse
restaurant hosted no-cover club nights all week. When 360 reopens
later this month, Updegraff intends to keep all of 360's nights
cover-free, whether the promoters like it or not. "Some people may
think I'm stupid," he says, "but I think a lot of times a cover kills
the club after a while."</TE>

<LD>A sampling of free or ultra-cheap places throughout the week:</LD>
<LD>   All Sizes: Star Shoes, that one-stop bar and vintage-shoe
headquarters, has great DJ nights throughout the week, but Friday
nights seem to fit the feet especially well, when DJs pour funky soul
off rare 7-inch records. 6364 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (323)
462-7827.</LD>
<LD>   Eastside: What's making the dance room at Echo Park's Short Stop
so hot? Is it the poor ventilation, the music or the booty-bustin'
heat? All of the above. Check out Wednesday's dub and dancehall
sounds, while anything with a beat can and will be used on Saturdays.
1455 Sunset Blvd., Echo Park, (213) 482-4942.</LD>
<TE>   Westside: Sundays feature progressive house sounds, but the best
party at Santa Monica's Circle Bar is on Tuesdays, with its jump-up
blend of underground and big-radio hip-hop, with a little scratching
thrown in. 2926 Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 450-0508.</TE>
<TE>   Trance-Connection: Because trance doesn't usually play well in bar
(hard beats aren't known for ringing up bar tabs like hip-hop does),
the best bet for this type of dancing is the restless Moontribe party
at Sugar on Tuesday nights, when the cover is just $2. 814 Broadway,
Santa Monica, (310) 899-1989.</TE>
<TE>   Rock-the-Bottom Prices: The best deal in Hollywood remains the Bud
Brothers' long-running Monday Social at Las Palmas. DJs spinning
anything from ambient techno to new-school breaks. Print out a pass
from the Web site and it's free before 11 p.m. and $5 after. 1714 Las
Palmas Ave., Hollywood, (323) 464-0171 www.budbrothers.com /freepass.</TE>
<TE>   Gearing Up: The reopening of 360 later this month will relaunch
its flagship evening, Tuesday night's Beige, which attracted a
cool-threaded mixed-gay crowd dancing to retro house, R&amp;B and
old-school grooves. 6290 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 871-2995.</TE>

<HD>Japanese Pub Fare Is Turning Elegant</HD>
<DH>The new Musha branch in Santa Monica layers refinement onto
the boisterous original, but its food is just as much fun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA BURUM</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whenever I've called the original Musha in Torrance, the commotion on
the other end of the line has sounded like a Tokyo train station at
rush hour. This chaos is a sign that it's as popular as ever.</LD>
<LD>   Musha cultivates the good-natured sense of faux debauchery
characteristic of the Japanese izakaya, an inexpensive pub where
people come for tapas-style snacks and countless rounds of sake or
beer. Waiters bellow out orders to the kitchen, occasionally slipping
in a double-entendre. A loud chorus of "Irasshai!" greets every
customer. At large communal tables, office workers unwind with
enthusiastic toasts of "Kampai!"</LD>
<LD>   The place has been a favorite hangout for employees of Japanese
multinational firms in the Torrance area since the early '90s. A few
weeks ago it opened a branch in Santa Monica, a short stroll from the
Promenade, but don't expect quite the same raucous scene at the new
place. Instead of communal tables, it has several discrete tatami
rooms and a somewhat more elegant demeanor that blends izakaya
tradition with the global perspective of hip Japanese youth. There's
still shouting, but it's been toned down.</LD>
<TE>   The smart facade, exposed air ducts and deep rust-colored, sponged
walls are thoroughly contemporary. Still, tradition is echoed in the
heavy wooden beams above the bar, the stacks of hand-formed stoneware
plates on every table and several tall tables that recall the days
when sake-drinking patrons stood at mobile stalls to eat and drink.</TE>
<TE>   Musha's self-described "Tokyo Cuisine" also unites the classic and
new. Strictly traditional izakaya dishes include stewed pork with
potatoes and small clams lightly steamed in sake. Other offerings,
such as Vietnamese spring rolls and Korean-style spicy soft tofu (sun
dubu), display the current Japanese taste for foreign cuisines
(filtered though they may be through Japanese sensibilities). One
successful crossover dish, vongole udon pasta, is an Asian twist on
spaghetti with white clam sauce: steamed clams and fat, chewy noodles
with slivered garlic, shimeji mushrooms and a touch of cream.</TE>
<TE>   On one visit, my guest ordered the octopus omelet, mainly out of
curiosity, but it turned out to be the most spectacular item on the
menu. It's a tall wedge of egg cake (resembling a frittata or Spanish
tortilla) stuffed with seasoned noodles and a fine julienne of
octopus, served on a hand-cut slab of stoneware dramatically glazed
with bright colors. And as if this lily needed gilding, it's crowned
with a beautiful arrangement of red pickled ginger, feathery shaved
bonito and sliced nori seaweed.</TE>
<TE>   The menu lists something called chicken cracker salad. "Chicken
crackers?" we wondered, so we had to try it. They turned out to be a
subtle take on tsumami, the rice crackers set out at sake bars. The
salad is fried chicken and crisp squares of puffed rice tossed with
young lettuce and a thin cream dressing. It's delicious, and our
order vanished in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Fried shrimp dumplings are pingpong ball-sized orbs of juicy
minced shrimp encased in crackly fried tofu skin--ideal for a
high-protein diet. Eggplant stuffed with lovely crabmeat is simply
washed in a bonito broth.</TE>
<TE>   Some novel dishes aren't as successful, though. A pumpkin dip on a
deep-fried egg roll skin is bland and comes with odd-tasting
crackers. And salmon tartar in a rich mayonnaise on a scoop of mashed
potato is really just too weird.</TE>
<TE>   Grilled dishes arrive handsomely on tiny clay braziers fueled with
charcoal briquettes. Tongue and rib-eye are wonderful this way, but
the duck with leeks needs rethinking. While simmering in its tiny
clay pan, it cooks to a soggy braise of either overcooked duck or
undercooked leek chunks.</TE>
<TE>   Tofu turns up in all sorts of ways, from skinny tofu French fries
with two sauces to tofu clam chowder (made with soy milk). With their
creamy centers, marinated fried tofu squares are an izakaya favorite,
and also one of mine.</TE>
<TE>   Beverages include not only sake and beer but wine, fruit juices
and mixed drinks made with rice vodka (soju). Just the ticket for
toasting "Kampai!" but in a more elegant way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Musha, 424 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica. (310) 576-6330. Dinner 6
p.m. to midnight daily. Beer and wine. Public parking lot on 4th
Street north of Wilshire. All major cards. Dinner for two: $22-$30,
food only.</TE>

<HD>KZLA Takes Imus Challenge, So Group Wins Charity Spins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Texas alternative-country group the Flatlanders became a charity case
on Wednesday as Los Angeles country radio station KZLA-FM (93.9) took
New York talk-show host Don Imus up on his offer to donate $10,000 to
charity for the first top-10 market station to play any song from the
band's "Now Again" album.</LD>
<LD>   "The Flatlanders get some exposure, our listeners get to hear
something a little different, and a charity gets some
money--everybody wins," said KZLA operations manager R.J. Curtis.</LD>
<LD>   He had worked a deal whereby Imus would donate $5,000 if the
station played one song, "Wavin' My Heart Good-Bye," hourly
throughout the day on Wednesday. That would be about half the plays
needed to place it in the station's top-10 rotation, the only
condition Imus placed on his offer.</LD>
<TE>   But during an on-air interview Wednesday with morning show host
Peter Tilden, Imus said, "I'm going to give you the whole 10 grand."
The money will go to Tilden's Children, an organization with eight
transitional homes throughout Los Angeles for homeless kids and their
families.</TE>
<TE>   "Now Again" has won the praise of critics and sporadic airplay on
a few small stations, but no country station in a top-10 market had
played anything from the album, according to Lon Helton, country
music editor of Radio &amp; Records.</TE>

<DH>Arthur Dong's new film finds parents who do anything to
change their gay children</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"My films aren't for everybody," says Arthur Dong from his Silver
Lake home office. "I don't get the 'Star Wars' type of crowds."</LD>
<LD>   While the 48-year-old Sundance award-winning documentarian doesn't
expect blockbuster box office, the films he makes about real-life
battles are arguably more compelling than any effects-laden spectacle
you're likely to see all summer.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning with "Public," a five-minute animated short he made in
1970 at age 16, Dong has always been fascinated with sexual
repression, oppression and violence, specifically in relation to
homosexuality. Though full of compassion and insight, films like
"Coming Out Under Fire" (1994) and "Licensed to Kill" (1997) are far
from the self-affirming (and sometimes self-congratulatory) fare
often seen at gay and lesbian film festivals. And he examines tough
issues to illustrate that the fight for gay civil rights is far from
over. His latest film, "Family Fundamentals," looks at the crossfire
between fundamentalist Christian parents and their gay and lesbian
children.</LD>
<TE>   Don't use the word "homophobia" to describe Dong's focus. He began
to reexamine the word while making "Coming Out Under Fire," adapted
from Alan Berube's nonfiction book on nine gay soldiers in World War
II. These Americans served at a time when the military established a
specific anti-gay policy; not coincidentally, the film was released
during the furor over then-President Clinton's "don't ask, don't
tell" policy.</TE>
<TE>   Dong and Berube "were writing the opening narration for the film
and we just thought the word wasn't quite right," says Dong. "The
word 'homophobia' implies fear and psychology as opposed to looking
at other issues like conditioning from church, education, family
upbringing or the media. All of these other factors are important in
constructing society's anti-gay beliefs. We finally decided the right
word was 'contempt,' contempt for homosexuality. Contempt, disgust,
disdain. How does that get constructed? How does it play out in our
daily lives?</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of the work I do reflects that questioning."</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, Dong was the victim of a gay bashing by four teenagers in
his hometown of San Francisco. Though he managed to escape his
attackers, the incident made headlines after the same teens
bludgeoned a priest the same night. The incident motivated Dong to
make "Licensed to Kill," a look at murderers of gay men that puts
human faces to the perpetrators of hate crimes. Dong's subjects
aren't monsters; they're articulate, disturbed and real. "I don't
choose people to be in my films to get that visceral ugliness that
Jerry Springer goes after on purpose," says Dong. "I purposely work
the other end. I'm mindful of getting different points of view."</TE>
<TE>   Dong took the same approach in making "Family Fundamentals." As
with his other films, the "casting" process came first. To find the
subjects he needed, he assembled a panel of religious advisors that
included everyone from the openly gay Rev. Mel White to Philip
Yancey, the editor at large of Christianity Today, a magazine started
by Billy Graham in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Dong found three sets of parents and children. To achieve a sense
of comfort with these potentially difficult interviewees, Dong worked
without a crew. "It was really liberating," he says. "I just went to
people's houses and said, 'Here I am, let me hook a mic to your
shirt' and that's it. No lights, no other people, it's just you and
me, so let's talk."</TE>
<TE>   One was a political family, though not related: Brian Bennett
shared a father-son bond with conservative Republican congressman Bob
Dornan until Bennett came out. He was ostracized by his mentor and
the gay community for being a gay Republican.</TE>
<TE>   The second was a church family: Brett Matthews, the son of a
Mormon bishop in Erda, Utah, was honorably discharged from the Air
Force in 1998 but stripped of veteran's benefits for coming out as
gay. Telling his parents in 1999 was even more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I came out to my mom while I was driving my car on the freeway,"
Matthews recounts. "She said she decided that it would be better if
we were both dead than for me to live a gay lifestyle and she tried
to wreck the car." Both survived. Matthews was understandably
surprised when his parents agreed to participate in "Family
Fundamentals," though they had second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat down with them at the kitchen table to sign the releases,
which they had agreed to sign," says Dong. "And they said they could
only participate if I made a film that encouraged their son to change
his sexual orientation. But I kept on shooting anyway without showing
their faces. They still allowed me to shoot, I'm not sure why. But
they didn't actually say no, they said they needed to pray about it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the third family, Dong focused on Kathleen Bremner, an
82-year-old San Diego grandmother who advocates therapy to change the
orientation of gays. Bremner conducts a monthly support-group meeting
for parents with children who have "become homosexual."</TE>
<TE>   She also runs a chapter of Spatula Ministries, a Southern
California organization so named by founder Barbara Johnson, who
said, "I need about a dozen big spatulas to pull these frantic moms
off the ceiling when they first learn their kid is homosexual." It
may sound cute, but Spatula's mission is serious about "providing
restoration to the family."</TE>
<TE>   For the past 15 years, Bremner has also organized the San Diego
Christian Trauma and Sexuality Conferences in collaboration with
"ex-gay" groups like Exodus and Focus to encourage homosexuals to
give up their lifestyle. Bremner's reasons for joining Spatula were
personal; her only daughter, Susan Jester, is a lesbian, and her
grandson David is gay.</TE>
<TE>   "My position on both my grandson and my daughter is that I love
them very dearly," says Bremner. "It's disappointing for me that they
chose a lifestyle that I don't think can bring them the joy and
happiness that the Lord wants for them. He created each one of us for
a loving abundant life, and if we veer into some wrong direction,
well, we have problems."</TE>
<TE>   "Kathleen Bremner says she loves her child, and I believe she
does," Dong says. "But then you look at her love, and I suppose it's
semantics, but where does that love go? Is that love able to
transcend the principle?"</TE>
<TE>   As Dong takes his film across the country, he isn't interested in
preaching to the converted. Recently, he persuaded Bates College in
Lewiston, Maine, to reschedule a screening of "Family Fundamentals"
from Oct. 11--National Coming Out Day--to a week earlier for Parents
Day. College officials told him "they separated the two events
because parents complained about it. And I said this is a film that
speaks to this exact conflict."</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the college agree to the date change but it will also
show "Licensed to Kill" and will host panels and seminars for
students and visiting parents. "We all need to be nurtured and
inspired for equality," Dong says. "But we also need to create some
dialogue on both sides of the conflict because it's escalating."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Family Fundamentals screens at Outfest Sunday, 5:15 p.m.; Tuesday,
5 p.m.; and July 21, 2:15 p.m. All screenings will be at the DGA. The
film will open Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day, at the Laemmle Music
Hall in Beverly Hills. Information: www.deepfocusproduc tions.com</TE>

House, 5750 Melrose Ave., L.A., (323) 462-4687.</LD>
<TE>   Oysters: Chef Scott Brandon serves striped bass on special in
various ways, always with its skin crisped. It may come on preserved
lemon polenta with sauteed tatsoi (a dark green bok choy), roasted
plum tomatoes and spicy harissa beurre blanc, or it may be marinated
with Thai basil, grilled over oak and served with wilted red spinach,
roasted asparagus, pancetta and red Bliss potato salad with a
lemon-ginger vinaigrette. (Striped bass, $24.) Oysters, 2515 E.
Pacific Coast Highway, Corona del Mar, (949) 675-7411.</TE>

salt. On the side come sauteed rapini, baby carrots or roasted
potatoes. (Striped bass, $24.) Il Sole, 8741 Sunset Blvd., West
Hollywood, (310) 657-1182.</TE>

Thurber cooks it with fresh porcini mushrooms, roasted tomatoes,
roasted garlic cloves, shallots, veal stock, Marsala and a few fresh
sage leaves. The hearty fish and earthy porcini go beautifully
together. (Wild striped bass, $24.) The Lobster, 1602 Ocean Ave.,

<LD>* New this week: That Cate Blanchett is outstanding under Gillian
Armstrong's direction unfortunately makes their "Charlotte Gray," in
which she plays a British secret agent in Vichy-controlled France,
all the more disappointing. Instead of the sharp World War II spy
thriller that it is reasonable to expect, the film is a bore. Neither
the leading men--Billy Crudup and Rupert Penry-Jones--nor Jeremy
Brock's plodding and unimaginative adaptation of Sebastian Faulks'
novel is up to the challenge. The lesson is as simple: Strong stars
and directors must be teamed with equally strong material and
co-stars to succeed.</LD>

<HD>'South Pacific': Enduring Wartime Romance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A touring "South Pacific" looked shipshape as it glided into the
Wilshire Theatre on Tuesday after a recent berth at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Goulet's performance is almost as French as his name. As
Emile, the planter who built a new life on an idyllic isle that's now
threatened by World War II, his voice has all the requisite power for
the magnificent Rodgers and Hammerstein score, although his vocal
approaches to some of the phrases offer a little too much Goulet and
not enough Emile.</LD>
<LD>   Amanda Watkins is an adorably bubbly Nellie Forbush, the young
American "hick" who falls for Emile until she learns about his
offspring from a local woman--at which point Watkins convincingly
pops the bubbles and assumes a much more restrained demeanor.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis Cleale gets maximum mileage out of the underwritten role of
Lt. Cable. His object of affection, Liat, is played by Kisha Howard,
whose regal glamour removes much of the unsavory quality that
inadvertently attends this romance when Liat is played as truly
"younger than springtime."</TE>
<TE>   David Warshofsky's line deliveries as Luther Billis have an
amusing nasal quality, although his appearance in drag seems a bit
subdued--this scene is funnier when the actor has a bigger beer
belly. Gretha Boston does the usual Bloody Mary shtick very well, and
the chorus is full of vim.</TE>
<TE>   Set designer Derek McLane's beaches are beautiful, but the look of
the distant island in the background never quite matches the magic
conjured up by "Bali H'ai." Scott Faris directed.</TE>

<HD>It's Open Season</HD>
<DH>Brahms program struggles to survive clattering china and
intrusive concession service in the Bowl's summer debut</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Big, brawny Brahms--the First Piano Concerto and Fourth
Symphony--opened the Los Angeles Philharmonic's summer classical
concerts at the Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday night. Paavo Jarvi
conducted, and Lars Vogt was the pianist--strong, serious performers
well suited for unfrivolous music. They had their work cut out for
them.</LD>
<LD>   Modern life is unlike what it appears to have been in the
glamorous, historic Otto Rothschild photographs recently installed at
the Hollywood Bowl museum. Back then, the audience dressed elegantly
(might the popularity of winter coats and furs seen in the old photos
be evidence of changed climate as well?), and "QUIET!" was painted in
large letters on the wood slats of the box seats. I can hear the
exquisite grace of Arthur Rubinstein's Brahms in my head as I look at
his backstage photo.</LD>
<LD>   Today, you get the feeling that the Patina Group, which has become
increasingly aggressive and, forgive the pun, tasteless in its Bowl
catering, would like nothing better than to turn the venue into the
world's largest restaurant. In the box seats, some meals are
delivered to patrons just as the concert is about to begin. I was
particularly glad to be far from the Pool Circle, where there is now
full sit-down service on clattery china.</LD>
<TE>   The only thing that remains the same year in and year out is the
music, and Tuesday it was not quite so easy a fit. Colorful balloons
were sent aloft in celebration of opening night. With a Freudian
slip, an announcer introduced an emcee from K-Mozart as from Kmart. A
frantic last-minute rush was made, and in many cases not made, to
stash picnics and prepare for the concert. Then, suddenly, the jolt
of that dark, somber, turbulent D-minor opening of the Brahms
concerto. Was anyone prepared for it? Certainly not the engineers
twisting the amplification dials.</TE>
<TE>   If the sound at the Hollywood Bowl had a bold and lifelike
presence, we might suddenly have been transported from one age to
another. But the ear takes time to adjust here; the mood changes as
the sun sets, the audience settles in and the sound system settles
down.</TE>
<TE>   Both Vogt and Jarvi take a modern approach that favors textural
clarity, carefully chiseled phrasing and biting rhythms, all useful
in cutting through the thick orchestrations. Vogt's tone is deep,
rich and bell-like, which is ideal for the burnished Brahms sound.</TE>
<TE>   Vogt's lyrical passages in the concerto's slow movement were
beautifully controlled, and he was exciting when throwing his weight
into the heroic theme of the first movement. This is a long concerto,
written by a young composer determined to write a blockbuster. It
wants to grab the listener by the throat and hold on for 40 minutes.
Tuesday's performance faded in and out of focus--the music simply
could not sound as big as the environment in which it found itself.</TE>
<TE>   The Fourth Symphony, late Brahms and more elegiac, was not
ineffective. Jarvi got some very expressive playing from the strings
in the first movement. Winds and brass sounded brittle, but it was
impossible to know whether balances were controlled from the podium
or the sound booth. My guess is that Jarvi was attempting an indoor
interpretation outdoors, and the engineers were compensating.
Indoors, this might well have held the attention throughout.
Outdoors, it needed more momentum, more chance taking.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Bernstein once conducted Brahms' Fourth at the Bowl as if
it were one long sex scene for a languid summer evening. Of those who
were in attendance, who will ever forget it?</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, the Fourth came and went, a summation to the evening,
like a nice after-dinner drink. The Philharmonic advertises the Bowl
as the place in which we can "summerize" ourselves (no more winter
coats). But memorable summers come from the stage, not the concession
stands.</TE>

<HD>A Real Heartthrob and Oh, So 'Sheik'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women allegedly fainted in the aisles of movie theaters back in 1921
while watching sex symbol Rudolph Valentino in the romantic action
adventure "The Sheik." Eighty-one years after the film was released,
the legendary screen lover still exudes a sexuality and charm that
can cause women's hearts to throb.</LD>
<LD>   Image Entertainment has released a special-edition double feature
of "The Sheik" and the equally enjoyable 1926 sequel, "The Son of the
Sheik" ($25). Valentino was in New York in August 1926 for the
premiere of "Son of the Sheik" when he collapsed and died eight days
later, at age 31.</LD>
<LD>   The DVD features a very amusing short film about a beauty contest
Valentino hosted at Madison Square Garden in 1923 and another quirky
short that finds the actor sunbathing at the beach. There is also
Pathe newsreel footage from 1926 chronicling the hysteria in New York
when his body lay in state.</LD>
<TE>   Valentino is at his dashing best in the 1925 adventure "The Eagle"
(Image, $25), in which he plays a Russian Robin Hood called the Black
Eagle. Deftly directed by Clarence Brown, "The Eagle" also stars
Louise Dresser. However, the print used for the DVD transfer leaves a
lot to be desired.</TE>
<TE>   John Barrymore, Drew's grandfather, was also one of the top movie
sex symbols of the 1920s, and he's perfectly cast in "The Beloved
Rogue" (Image, $25), an exciting historical romance from 1927.
Barrymore plays the infamous French poet-patriot Francois Villon, who
risks his life to save his lady love. The lavish production,
handsomely designed by William Cameron Menzies, also marks the
American film debut of the famed German actor Conrad Veidt, who is
best known for his role as Humphrey Bogart's nemesis in "Casablanca."
He's perfectly cast as the superstitious King Louis XI.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New from Warner this week is the digital debut of "Oh, God" ($20),
which became one of the surprise hits of 1977. Directed by Carl
Reiner and written by Larry Gelbart, this clever comedy finds John
Denver playing an affable everyman who is chosen by God (George
Burns) to be his spokesperson on Earth. Besides a wide-screen edition
of the film, the DVD includes enjoyable commentary from Reiner,
Gelbart and co-star Teri Garr.</TE>
<TE>   Warner also recently released the DVD of the nostalgic 1982
comedy/drama "My Favorite Year" ($20). A thinly disguised depiction
of the 1950s Sid Caesar TV series "Your Show of Shows," this
delightful movie focuses on one of the series' young writers (Mark
Linn-Baker), who has to chaperon the week's guest star, a flamboyant,
drunken movie star (Peter O'Toole in his Oscar-nominated
performance). Lainie Kazan, Jessica Walter, Selma Diamond, Bill Macy
and Joe Bologna also star. The DVD includes perceptive commentary
from Richard Benjamin, who made his directorial debut with the film.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Gloria Stuart in a poignant moment as an elderly woman
who dances with O'Toole at a nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peter Davis' "Hearts and Minds," a bold and unsparing look at
America's involvement in Vietnam, stirred a lot of controversy when
it was released in 1974. Winner of the best documentary Oscar,
"Hearts and Minds" tells its story through interviews with government
officials, soldiers, Vietnam vets, Vietnamese, footage shot in
Vietnam by Davis' crew and newsreel clips. The new Criterion DVD
($40) features a crisp digital transfer, plus Davis' intelligent,
thought-provoking commentary. He explains that he wanted to explore
three themes in the movie: Why did we get involved in Vietnam? What
did we do there? And what did the war to do us as a country?</TE>

<HD>'Nellyville' Leads a Rap Triple Play on Sales Chart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nelly's "Nellyville" led a rap contingent that claimed the top three
places on the nation's album sales chart this week, according to
Neilsen SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis rapper's album sold 447,000 copies in its second
week in stores to hold onto the top chart position that it had
earlier wrested away from Eminem's "The Eminem Show," which had been
No. 1 for the previous five weeks. The Eminem album sold 263,000
copies last week to push its sales total to 3.9 million since its
release in late May.</LD>
<LD>   Third place on the new chart was claimed by the first solo album
by record executive and producer Irv Gotti. Featuring such guest
artists as DMX and Ashanti, "The Inc" sold 193,000 copies in its
first week.</LD>
<TE>   Aerosmith's "Ultimate Greatest Hits," which finished fourth with
sales of 137,000 copies, was the only other new release to make the
Top 10.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the Top 10 are held, in order, by Avril
Lavigne, Ashanti, Korn, N.O.R.E., Pink and the compilation "Totally
Hits 2002."</TE>
<TE>   "Nellyville" is expected to be challenged by the Red Hot Chili
Peppers' just-released "By the Way" for the No. 1 spot next week. The
remix version of Elvis Presley's 1968 recording "A Little Less
Conversation" remains No. 1 on the singles chart.</TE>
<TE>   Sound Advice</TE>
<TE>   (From Times reviews)</TE>
<TE>   Red Hot Chili Peppers' "By the Way" (Warner Bros.). The collection
lacks the striking spareness of its "Californication," but the
arrangements are rich and often surprising, deploying strings, spacey
effects and acoustic stretches.</TE>
<TE>   Nelly's "Nellyville" (Universal). Here's another rap album that
mines the familiar theme of surviving celebrity. But the follow-up to
the hugely successful "Country Grammar" proves that the story doesn't
have to be hackneyed.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem's "The Eminem Show" (Aftermath/Interscope). What makes
Eminem such an extraordinary blend of commercial appeal and artistic
accomplishment is that he can move from the darkness of "Cleaning Out
My Closet," one of the most gripping songs on this album, to the
catchiness of pop tunes that seduce with their cute, nursery-rhyme
charm.</TE>
<TE>   Avril Lavigne's "Let Go" (Arista). Girl-rock meets boy-rock in
this polished debut from a 17-year-old Canadian waif with attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Papa Roach's "Lovehatetragedy" (DreamWorks). These new tunes,
however heartfelt, lack the contagious energy and undeniable hooks of
the band's first album.</TE>
<TE>   Oasis' ''Heathen Chemistry'' (Epic). The opening track, ''The
Hindu Times,'' echoes everything that once made this band's music so
joyful, but little else suggests that songwriter Noel Gallagher has
regained the confidence and direction that abandoned him after 1997's
"Be Here Now."</TE>

Hanks, who plays an Irish American gangster seeking vengeance across

<TE>   The Robert Randolph Family Band arrives Friday at the House of
Blues, allowing fans to see the flip side of "sacred steel" whiz
Randolph's talents. The 24-year-old instrumentalist created a buzz
earlier this year when he showed up in the Word, a contemporary
gospel collaboration that teamed him with the North Mississippi

his own group, which has opened for the Dave Matthews Band and will
be part of the Grateful Dead reunion concerts next month in
Wisconsin.</TE>

<TE>   The fact that we have the term "self-portrait" indicates that
artists are not afraid to come out from behind the canvas. The new
photography exhibition "Artist as Art," opening at Apex Fine Art,
makes artists the subjects of other people's art--in this case,
photographs of 20th century artists--such as Charlie Chaplin, Alfred
Hitchcock, Jackson Pollock and Georgia O'Keeffe.</TE>
<TE>   "Artist as Art," Apex Fine Art, 152 N. La Brea Ave., L.A. Tuesdays

<TE>   What do the U.S., Brazil and Japan have in common? One answer is:
Karen Tei Yamashita, an uncommon author who has mixed ethnographic
travelogue with social commentary and a dash of magic realism in her
novel "Circle K Cycles." The Beverly Hills Public Library's New Short
Fiction Program presents a reading of Tei's novel, which interprets
the lives of descendants of Japanese immigrant workers in Brazil.
Spoken-word artist Sally Shore and actors Robert Shinso, Jimmy
Taenaka and Jenny Woo are featured; Yamashita will sign her book
following the performance.</TE>

<TE>   Founded and directed by Marissa "Mighty" Labog, a local dance
group called One Step Ahead steps out in the Watercourt in California
Plaza with a program titled "Hope in Hollywood: Hip-Hop in the
Making." Designed to help young people channel their energies in a
positive direction and simultaneously destroy negative stereotypes
about popular culture, the project features performers who have
adopted such monikers as Lockn' Key, Lady Neva, Ohala and Shy Girl.
All have stories about how dance took over their lives, which they
share with their peers. In the words of group member Proto-J:
"Hip-hop is fun, kick back, you don't have to worry about people
looking at you, fights, etc.... Breaking is pretty much my life. I
break full time. It's my lifestyle."</TE>

Mediterranean island, where she discovers a more complex past,
present and future than she ever expected. Najwa Nimri, Daniel Freire

<LD>   "Gustave Le Gray, Photographer," which opened earlier this week at
the J. Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Center, is billed as the
largest exhibition of works in America by one of France's most
important photographers. The survey will include the seascapes and
cloud studies that made him famous, as well as atmospheric forest
scenes, portraits of Napoleon III and his wife and Paris landscapes
made between the early 1850s and 1867.</LD>
<LD>   "Gustave Le Gray, Photographer," J. Paul Getty Museum, 1200 Getty
Center Drive, Brentwood. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays,
10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Ends
Sept. 29. Free. (310) 440-7300.</LD>
<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   It's been a quarter-century since American Ballet Theatre has put
as many international stars into a single Southern California
performance as will shine in "Le Corsaire" at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion tonight. Other performances in the four-day engagement will
offer stars as well, but the glittering opening-night lineup is
headed by Russia's Nina Ananiashvili, Argentina's Julio Bocca, Cuba's
Jose Manuel Carreno, Spain's Angel Corella and Joaquin De Luz, plus
America's own Gillian Murphy. With lesser principals in Orange
County, the ballet itself seemed a cheesy retread of the 19th century
Russian repertory--nonessential viewing except when cast like this.</TE>
<TE>   "Le Corsaire," American Ballet Theatre, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,
Los Angeles Music Center, 135 N. Grand Ave., downtown L.A., 8 p.m.
Also Friday, 8 p.m.; Saturday, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 p.m. $20 to
$90. (213) 365-3500.</TE>
<TE>   7:30pm Music</TE>
<TE>   The French gypsy-klezmer ensemble Les Yeux Noirs comes to the free
outdoor Summer Sunset Concert series at the Skirball Cultural Center.
Led by a pair of violinist brothers, Les Yeux Noirs ("The Black
Eyes") performs the joyful folk music of the former Yugoslavia,
Hungary, Romania and the rest of Eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Les Yeux Noirs, Skirball Cultural Center, 2701 N. Sepulveda Blvd.,
Brentwood, 7:30 p.m. Free. (310) 440-4500.</TE>
<TE>   7pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   Helen Hunt and Tim Robbins will star in a staged reading of
journalist Anne Nelson's emotionally charged drama "The Guys" at the
Actors' Gang in Hollywood. The play was inspired by Nelson's
experience in helping a New York City fire captain prepare eulogies
for his men who were killed Sept. 11 at the World Trade Center. Still
in production off-Broadway, a few blocks north of ground zero, "The
Guys" has been performed by a rotating cast of actors--Sigourney
Weaver, Bill Murray, Susan Sarandon and Anthony LaPaglia, among them.
Slated for an indefinite run here, the show will feature a different
cast every three weeks; Hunt and Robbins will perform through July
28.</TE>
<TE>   "The Guys," Actors' Gang Theatre, 6209 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Hollywood, 7 p.m. Regular schedule: Wednesdays to Saturdays, 7 p.m.;
Sundays, 2 p.m. Runs indefinitely. $40; tickets for firefighters
available for $15 at each performance. (Discounts subject to
availability.) (323) 465-0566, Ext. 15.</TE>

<LD>A.D. may as well be a latter-day Studio 54. I popped into the
Hollywood nightclub Saturday, and it was like scaling the cliffs of
insanity. The mob scene out front was hundreds deep, and along with
such divas as Christina Aguilera, Janet Jackson and Missy Elliott,
boy toys such as Mark McGrath, Justin Timberlake and Hot Karl were in
the house.</LD>
<LD>   Hot Karl, a rapper who calls himself "Valley trash," worked the
crowd with his entourage, which included his mother and a 7-foot-tall
funky chicken. I got jiggy with a Playboy bunny named Priscilla, who
was whipping McGrath's posse into a frenzy with her hot-potato dance
moves. Speaking of hot potatoes, Kelly Osbourne showed up with a note
from her mom, promising she wouldn't drink. Oh be-have!</LD>
<LD>   Score another round for Beverly Hills. De Mori's nightclub is
making its debut July 26, and fans of the martini should note the new
Italian spot offers 65 variations, including bubble gum and
blow-pop.... Caught Paul Stanley driving up Coldwater Canyon in full
KISS makeup and wig, with the top down on his Ferrari....</LD>
<TE>   We have it on good authority that Guns N' Roses rocker Slash
chatted up dreamy pop icon Lance Bass for about 10 minutes backstage
at the Forum after a recent Aerosmith visit. Turns out Bass was
simply being polite. He had no idea who he was talking to. Hey,
you've seen one rocker, you've seen 'em all.... Speaking of GNR,
Stargunn rocker Shooter Jennings got to play Axl at a recent Arena
gig, backed by real Guns N' Roses players Slash, Matt Sorum and Duff
McKagan. I say put it on the road ....This just in: Punk fave AFI is
making a guest appearance at today's pirate-themed Warped Tour at the
L.A. Memorial Coliseum. Ahoy, matey.</TE>

<HD>Changing Lanes</HD>
<DH>Bowling isn't what it used to be, but thanks to rock 'n'
roll, it's not headed down the gutter</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lustre King is dead.</LD>
<LD>   To inspect the corpse, just step inside Hollywood Star Lanes on
Santa Monica Boulevard and look for the buffing machine, which in
happier days polished balls for 15 cents a minute. That's the Lustre
King, and nobody is going to fix it.</LD>
<LD>   The entire alley, in fact, is targeted for closure to make way for
a new school. Owner Mike Barnese, who opened the 32-lane building
with his father in October 1960, plans to retire.</LD>
<TE>   If all these clues lead you to suspect that old-fashioned bowling
is headed the way of the manual typewriter, you're not the first.</TE>
<TE>   But wait. There are at least two reasons to take the dim prospects
on Santa Monica Boulevard in stride.</TE>
<TE>   First, Hollywood Star Lanes will remain open, 24 hours a day,
through Aug. 7, possibly longer if some longshot appeal gives the Los
Angeles Unified School District pause. So if the mood strikes, a
sometime bowler can wander in and once more be transported by the
clamor of pins, the innocence of the old posters, the scent of $1.25
tacos on the grill--the same strange, faded atmosphere that led the
Coen brothers to use Star Lanes in their 1998 cult favorite "The Big
Lebowski."</TE>
<TE>   (Should that wandering sometime bowler take to the lanes, he might
roll, oh, a 153 and a 131, failing to convert two or three easy spare
opportunities in the second game.)</TE>
<TE>   The second reason to remain calm, if you're a nostalgic bowler or
a historian seeking pop culture props, is the wealth of the
marketplace. No matter what happens to Star Lanes, a whole Lustre
Kingdom survives out there.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on where and when you travel among Southern California's
bowling zones, you may find yourself at play among raging
psychobillies in Eagle Rock, longtime leaguers in Mar Vista,
bedazzled tourists in Universal City or elementary schoolers in
Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   You may pay $2 a game (probably midday, midweek) or $6 (probably
Saturday night). You may pay by the hour or you may choose from among
afternoon kiddie birthday packages (which have proliferated wildly in
recent years, along with the use of shame-averting gutter guards).
You may bowl to muted 1970s pop tunes under bright fluorescent light
or to thunderous rock 'n' roll under cover of darkness. And probably
you'll snack a little.</TE>
<TE>   After all, as AMF Bowling Worldwide notes in its literature for
would-be bowling center operators: "Bowlers consume more food and
beverages on site than participants in any other sport."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Think of bowling as a 16-ounce mug containing 8 ounces of beer.</TE>
<TE>   You can argue that this mug is half-full. Though bowling often
runs behind golf and tennis as a participant sport, industry surveys
report that more than 50 million Americans bowled last year. The
sport is amply exposed on TV by the series "Ed" on NBC and "Let's
Bowl" on Comedy Central. A trio of Microsoft alumni bought the
Professional Bowlers Assn. in 2000, hired a couple of Nike marketing
alumni, and made a deal with ESPN to pump up bowling's profile.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the fashion-forward set are donning bowling shirts and
those trademark two-toned shoes. And many alley owners see great
potential in the low-lights-and-loud-music evenings. Some call it
cosmic or atomic or galactic bowling, some call it electric fog, some
say rock 'n' bowl, some say bowlarama.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you call it, "it's really helped the industry lately,
with an influx of kids," says R.F. Corderman, Garden Grove-based
publisher of Pacific Bowler. "I'm sure some of those kids are going
to become regular bowlers."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the half-empty aspect of bowling. The nation's
biggest operator of bowling alleys, AMF Bowling Worldwide Inc., which
owns more than 500 bowling centers worldwide and about two dozen in
Southern California, filed for bankruptcy reorganization in July
2001, scraped up about $350 million in financing and reemerged in
March 2002.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most-quoted works of pop sociology remains Robert D.
Putnam's "Bowling Alone" (published in 2000), in which a Harvard
professor makes the much-contested suggestion that declining
bowling-league enrollment is just one symptom of a broader decline of
community in America.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, pro bowling hasn't had a regular spot on network
television since 1997, when ABC dropped its Saturday broadcasts after
36 years. And the number of bowling centers, now estimated at 7,000
in the U.S., has dwindled over the last two decades. The latest to
die include AMF Bowlerland in Van Nuys and AMF Village Lanes in El
Monte, both of which closed in early June. Clearly, all is not well
in the Lustre Kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regal Lanes, the biggest bowling center on the West Coast, is a
vast, vaguely Bavarian expanse that has stood on Tustin Street in
Orange since 1975. Beyond its willkommen sign, it features 72 lanes,
a pro shop, hofbrau, ratskeller, biergarten and two fully functional
Lustre Kings. To find a larger bowling center, you have to cross the
state line to get to the 106-lane Castaways Championship Bowling
Center in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a league house," says Regal Lanes General Manager Cora
Coffin, which is another way of saying we belong to the old school.
Along with casual bowlers, corporate and birthday parties, and
banquets, the venue hosted more than 2,000 league bowlers last
winter.</TE>
<TE>   Management encourages them with free child care and such
old-school customs as handing out score sheets and pencils to those
who like to keep score by hand.</TE>
<TE>   When a sometime bowler steps up to the Regal Lanes counter alone
on a lonely Tuesday afternoon, the clerk knows to ask, "One lane or
two?" because this customer may be a hotshot looking to replicate
tournament conditions. (If that sometime bowler is the unambitious,
inconsistent kind who needs only one lane, he's likely to score
around 145 at Regal, improving to 196 in a second game on the
strength of several strikes in later frames.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's a different business than it was 25 years ago, when
Coffin first entered a bowling alley in a professional capacity. (She
was a cocktail waitress, then a bar manager, then a league
coordinator, then manager.)</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, you couldn't get into a bowling center Monday through
Friday at 6 p.m. unless you were in a league," Coffin says. "Eighty
percent of the business 25 years ago was leagues. Now, I would say
maybe 45% of your business is leagues. And it was a lot more aimed at
adults 25 years ago, when I started. Bowling centers didn't do
birthday parties 25 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Now birthdays are only the beginning of a recreational menu that
stretches as far as--well, as far as All Star Lanes in Eagle Rock on
a Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me!" says a thoroughly tattooed man with slicked-down
hair, taking a seat at the scoring table. "Do you know how to mark a
spare?!"</TE>
<TE>   He speaks loudly, because all around him, All Star Lanes--possibly
the least reverent monument to old-fashioned bowling in Los Angeles
County--has devolved into an orgy of kitsch, wailing guitars and
profoundly unserious bowling. In the bar, a psychobilly band--one
that fuses rockabilly and punk--is blazing through an up-tempo
version of America's "Horse With No Name."</TE>
<TE>   Crowded throughout the bar and the alley's 22 bowling lanes, young
men and women drink and laugh and holler in T-shirts, black leather
jackets, metal studs, copious tattoos, buzz cuts and mohawks. Out in
the parking lot, stragglers slouch with their cigarettes amid vintage
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   All Star Lanes doesn't get the attention that Hollywood Star Lanes
does, but for the nostalgic bowler, the Eagle Rock venue, which dates
to the late 1950s, offers an even stranger trip. Instead of charging
by the game, management usually charges bowlers $8 to $10 per hour
per lane. Besides offering only manual scoring, All Star Lanes also
relies on ceiling fans instead of air-conditioning and uses a
ball-return system that most alleys did away with before Lyndon
Johnson reached the presidency: The elevated ball-return gutter is
uncovered, so that as you approach the foul line to throw your own
ball, somebody else's is rushing back up the gutter at you.</TE>
<TE>   It's a setup that might throw off a newcomer. (In fact, it's easy
to imagine a sometime bowler rolling, oh, 114 in his first game,
switching from one battered old ball to another, then recovering with
a 179 in the next.) But the weirdness is clearly a draw, especially
on those two Saturdays per month when live music is offered.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance fee is $12, more if the bands are notable, which
covers music, shoes and unlimited bowling, unless a line of would-be
bowlers backs up. (You have to be 21 to enter the bar with the bands
but can be any age to bowl.)</TE>
<TE>   On this night, the polite, tattooed fellow with the spare question
is 29-year-old Jeff Klinedinst of Simi Valley. As his wardrobe and
presence here suggest, he is a big fan of all things of the '50s--in
fact, he says he and two friends came here tonight for the nostalgic
theme. But he has never seen a bowling alley without automatic
scoring and has never been tutored in where to mark the slashes and
Xs that mean spares and strikes or where to scribble a bowler's
running total.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah!" he says, absorbing a brief lesson. He takes to the score
sheet with a vengeance. And when their first game is done, around the
time the band lurches into the theme from "Rawhide," instead of
heading over to the bar, he and his friends launch into a second
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The purist, who might run screaming from All Star Lanes, would
head directly for someplace more orderly. Someplace that cultivates
leagues and the sort of bowlers who take seriously the dilemma posed
by the 7-10 split. Someplace like Mar Vista Bowl, where a Tuesday
night finds Mark Bayers and his playmates settling in for a few hours
of league play.</TE>
<TE>   "Bowling is kind of a love," says Bayers, who serves as secretary
for the Teledyne Technologies summer league. He's been bowling here
more than 30 of his 44 years, with occasional breaks to work and
raise children. As a 12-year-old, Bayers used to ride his bike here
from home on Saturday mornings--balancing his bowling ball on the
bike as he pedaled--and then roll 20 games or so.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two years later, Bayers hops down to lane 19 when his turn
comes, grabs his ball and freezes in a pre-approach pose, like a
martial artist about to vent fury. Then he glides forward and rolls.
A strike. Then another. He averages about 180 but stresses "we're a
fun league, not a money league," with ages and averages all over the
map.</TE>
<TE>   League bowlers like Bayers have sustained the 28-lane Mar Vista
facility since its opening in 1961. Phil Yoakum, who has run the pro
shop since 1974, acknowledges that league membership has slipped but
notes that between 6 and 9 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, the center
still has virtually no room for casual bowlers, only league
competition. (In the same way that tour operators insist on
discussing motor coaches, not buses, people close to the bowling
trade speak of centers, not alleys.)</TE>
<TE>   Bayers can't stay away, he says, because "it is a sport, and
there's the camaraderie of being on a team. And"--he glances down to
lane 19--"Sorry. I have to bowl now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No matter how many bowling al... centers you haunt, certain
constants remain. Upon entering, you hear clatter. If you need to
rent bowling shoes, you'll probably need to hand over a shoe of your
own as collateral. (Bowling, a wise man from Long Beach once said, is
the only chance we ever get to truly stand in somebody else's shoes.)
You will then face the strange chore of choosing a house ball if you
didn't bring your own. Unless it's a novelty model, the ball will
weigh 8 to 16 pounds, and it must travel 60 feet to the pins across
floorboards of oiled maple or something more durable that looks like
maple.</TE>
<TE>   But the future probably won't look like Hollywood Star Lanes or
All Star Lanes. For a peek at what may arise instead, just head to
Jillian's Hi-Life Lanes at Universal CityWalk. Open since April 2000,
it's a tiny place, with a restaurant and arcade (including virtual
bowling) downstairs, 10 lanes and a bar upstairs. Everything is
shiny, new and ultra-kitsch: the colors loud, the music louder, the
monitors large, the upholstered seats designed to resemble those from
a '50s Chevy.</TE>
<TE>   On five large video screens above the lanes, clips from Spider-Man
cartoons, Three Stooges shorts and "Barbarella" are in rotation.
Real-time sports events fill four TV monitors below. And finally
there's the third row of monitors, where your score is displayed. (A
sometime bowler, for instance, might roll a 131 and 146, troubled
slightly by a sore arm and perhaps distracted by the crowd gathering
downstairs for the red-carpet premiere of "The Bourne Identity.")</TE>
<TE>   Old-fashioned bowlers want nothing to do with the place, but for
teenagers and tourists it's a different story. Jilllian's is part of
a chain of upscale food-drink-bowling-- billiards-games joints that
began in Boston in 1988 and now has outlets in about 20 states.</TE>
<TE>   Prices run $4.50 to $6 per game, peaking on Friday and Saturday
nights. There are no leagues. Also, in case the cost of parking,
bowling, eating and tipping your server isn't enough to command your
attention, Jillian's bills leave a line for adding a separate
gratuity to your bowling fees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Basically, the bowling business is in a mad scramble for young
customers. That strategy gets even clearer as you pass through venues
such as the Montrose Bowling Center on Honolulu Avenue, Pickwick Bowl
in Burbank and, to a lesser degree, Sports Center Bowl in Studio
City.</TE>
<TE>   The eight-lane Montrose Bowling Center specializes in private
parties (frequently children's birthdays) with no regular hours for
open bowling or leagues. Instead of paying $3 or $4 per game, you pay
$80 to $100 per hour for the whole place.</TE>
<TE>   The larger Pickwick operation, neighbored by an ice rink and an
equestrian center at the edge of Griffith Park, offers a battery of
birthday party packages and keeps the ball racks filled with
kid-friendly sizes. A sometime bowler, stopping in to roll a 127 and
a 167 on a Friday afternoon, might find two or three private parties
in progress but no bowlers over age 12. That changes dramatically on
Saturday nights, when Pickwick's "electric fog" specials pull in many
teens and twentysomethings and the price per game jumps from $3 or
$3.75 to $6.</TE>
<TE>   Sports Center Bowl, on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, is part
Hollywood and part suburbia, and gets its share of kids, too.
Neighbored by a Jerry's Famous Deli (temporarily closed for repairs
since a fire in May), it has long been known for attracting
celebrities and features a high-caliber wall of fame (glossies
include Kobe Bryant, Drew Carey, Helen Hunt and Rob Reiner). On
request, you can get a gutter guard to keep kids encouraged, and of
course there's a long list of birthday party options.</TE>
<TE>   To keep grown-ups encouraged, top scores from days gone by are
posted by management over the lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who looks up from Lane 29, for instance, is reminded that
on this spot on Sept. 21, 1989, Rocky German rolled a 300. It's a
small thing, but might be the key to inspiring a youngster, or a
sometime bowler, the sort of fellow who might struggle through a 139
game, then, despite an increasingly sore arm and twitchy back,
stumble into a startling string of strikes in his second game. That
bowler might wind up with a personal high of 217, and then, enjoying
the approval of an unseen Lustre King somewhere above, he might pause
to slowly enjoy a beverage while that score remained on overhead
display for all to admire.</TE>
<TE>   That wouldn't make a bowler vain, would it?</TE>

<DH>From giant eyeballs to Yankee Doodle, stylized bowling
balls are on a roll</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN CHANG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Movie critics may sneer at "Kingpin," but bowlers nationwide revere
the 1996 Farrelly brothers comedy for inspiring one of the sport's
more frivolous trends: the stylized ball.</LD>
<LD>   Before that milestone, the "glitter ball" of the late 1960s and
1970s, with its iridescent surface, was as exciting as bowling balls
got. But "Kingpin's" rose ball--a transparent sphere with a bouquet
of miniature red roses suspended within--and the similar skull ball
from 1999's "Mystery Men," generated enough interest among bowlers
that manufacturers took notice.</LD>
<LD>   In the years since, designs have grown increasingly playful, from
smiley faces to beer bottles. Dragons and tarantulas and such icons
usually relegated to the tattoo parlor are showing up too. Some
models are performance-driven, but most are just glossed-up
collector's items.</LD>
<TE>   "I went into the store, I said, 'That's a cool ball,' and I bought
it," said Scott Binder, who two weeks ago became the proud owner of a
"golf" ball--that is, a bowling ball encasing a giant dimpled golf
ball. It was a perfect fit for Binder, who visits Anaheim's Concourse
Bowling Center four times a week and watches golfer Tiger Woods on TV
every weekend he's on.</TE>
<TE>   The question isn't why anyone would want to bowl with a giant
eyeball; the question is are there enough people who want to?</TE>
<TE>   With enough letters, calls and e-mails, a bowling ball company
might try anything.</TE>
<TE>   "It's entirely up to the manufacturers themselves," said Quin
Barron, manager of the Bowlers Depot pro shop at Regal Lanes in
Orange County. "If they get enough interest nationally and if it's
feasible for them, they'll go ahead and do it." With the exceptions
of the rose and skull balls, both of which were sold in limited
editions (although the skull ball pops up fairly often on EBay), most
designs are mass-produced and sell for $120 to $140.</TE>
<TE>   Ebonite remains the dominant manufacturer of balls of the
trapped-in-glass variety, in which a three-dimensional object is
sealed in the core and protected by a transparent polyester shell.
Ebonite's OPTYX line boasts the skull ball, a Budweiser ball (a Bud
Light version is also on tap) and a stars-and-stripes Yankee Doodle
ball, whose sales shot up after Sept. 11. The manufacturer Storm
struck upon the popular sports ball-within-a-ball concept. Track took
the sports collectible idea to an extreme with the Sugar Ray Leonard
ball, which contains a replica of the boxer's red glove as well as an
engraving of his signature.</TE>
<TE>   Brunswick's Viz-A-Ball line took stylization in a more efficient
direction with its laser-imaging machine, which allows designs of
boundless intricacy, such as Disney or Looney Tunes characters.
Because the images are imprinted directly onto its surface, a
Viz-A-Ball is usually available in a far greater selection of weights
and sizes than most trapped-in-glass balls, which require a set
amount of materials to achieve the right balance. For the same
reason, a Viz-A-Ball's exposed images are also more likely to scratch
off over time--assuming you actually bowl with the decorated balls.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a polished collector's item belongs in the gutter with its
more modest brethren is ultimately a question of sport versus style,
though the two, like bowling and Budweiser, need not be mutually
exclusive. If three tightly coiled, fiercely magnified venomous
snakes invigorate your game, knock yourself out.</TE>
<TE>   And a few pins, while you're at it.</TE>

<LD>Someone still reveling in single-digit birthdays might have trouble
relating to the age of things at the George C. Page Museum at the La
Brea Tar Pits. There's a 14,000-year-old juniper tree that's the
centerpiece of a new diorama, for instance, and fossils up to 40,000
years old.</LD>
<LD>   And the museum itself is turning 25.</LD>
<LD>   To mark the anniversary, and the start of the annual summer fossil
dig, the museum is throwing a daylong celebration at the tar pits.
Costumed characters from a modern "Ice Age"--the movie--will mingle
with the kids and Nigel Marven of "Nigel's Wild Wild World" on the
Discovery Channel brings his animal show--with distant relatives of
Ice Age creatures--to the outdoor stage.</LD>
<TE>   Over at Pit 91, scientists will be at work digging out more
fossils, as their annual two-month dig--which the public can
watch--gets underway.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the only active paleontological dig in the middle of a city
anywhere in the world," says Jim Gilson, administrator of the Page
Museum. "It's sort of like going to a dinosaur national park, but all
you have to do is drive down the street and park."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, educators will give tours of the pit, where a
half-dozen excavators should be immersed in primordial goo--actually
bubbling asphalt--"digging deeper into the past than ever before,"
says John Harris, the museum's chief curator for paleontology. Pit 91
is the only one among 100 tar pits in Hancock Park that continues to
be excavated. The oldest fossils from the pit, first excavated in
1908, are 40,000 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Tours will explain how the painstaking excavation work at Pit
91--a syrupy pond roughly 28 feet square--is accomplished. Harris
says they are excited about beginning to dig at the 14-foot level,
even though it will take several years to completely dig across the
pit at that depth. (Excavators only dig 6 to 12 inches deeper each
year.)</TE>
<TE>   "The hope is there that we will find something new," he says,
since work will be in the southwest corner, where fossils are
concentrated. "After a while, you get a bit blase about your finds.
If you find the leg of a ground sloth or even the jaw or limb of a
saber-toothed  cat, it's not quite as exciting. It's the rare things,
like the talons of an eagle or the fruit of a juniper tree, that are
most exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Tour guides will describe how a fossil is cleaned and categorized
and, if they are lucky, point out workers plucking bones out of the
ground. A tally board will track how many fossils are excavated
during the day.</TE>
<TE>   More than 3.5 million fossils are in the Page Museum's collection,
and they represent more than 650 different species of animals and
plants. In an average year, about 1,000 fossils are discovered.
Currently, the bones of two short-faced bears, which are a bit bigger
than grizzly bears, are being pulled out of Pit 91.</TE>
<TE>   "Together, the finds give you a tremendously detailed picture of
what life was like here at the end of the last Ice Age," Harris says.
"For its time period, this is probably the richest site in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   New documentation of that richness will be unveiled at 10:30 a.m.
Sunday when a new juniper tree diorama, which interprets what the
local climate was 20,000 years ago, is unveiled. In the scene,
skeletal remains abound: A golden eagle--the most common fossil found
in the tar pits--is perched on the tree; a coyote looks up at the
eagle, a jackrabbit in its talons.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, free activities will be held outdoors and food
will be available. Festival-goers can have their faces painted to
resemble Ice Age predators, reconstruct a life-size skeleton of a
saber-toothed cat or listen to Albert Cooper, a historian who plays a
1920s "bone digger," who will recount his fossil-hunting days.</TE>
<TE>   Animals with meat still on their bones will also be part of the
day. Marven's two 20-minute afternoon shows will feature live, local
animals. The exact species of his co-stars remains to be determined,
Gilson says. It depends on whom Marven bonds with best.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<KH>MY FAVORITE WEEKEND</KH>
<HD>April Winchell, Radio Personality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>* The radio show host is heard Saturdays, 7-10 p.m., on KFI-AM (640)
and is also the voice of many Disney Channel cartoon characters,
including Cruella De Vil.</LD>
<LD>   Attention, Celebrity Shoppers: One of the greatest joys of living
in Los Angeles is the occasional star sighting. For my money, the
best place for this is Gelson's in Century City. There's something
fascinating about watching celebrities stocking up on the same stuff
mortals use. Whenever I see a celeb pushing a cart, I trail them
discreetly, hoping to get an inventory of their purchases. I've seen
Anne Robinson buying grapes, Jodie Foster buying milk, and the late
Juliet Prowse buying four half-gallon jugs of generic vodka and a
head of lettuce. But my greatest moment came when I saw John Lithgow
with an eight-pack of Charmin. I had to breathe into a bag of oranges
just to keep from passing out.</LD>
<LD>   Stars, Take 2: My husband contends that Sports Club L.A. on
Sepulveda is where the stars really shine. The bonus there is that
not only do you see them working out, you can see them naked, if your
timing is right. Many a night he has come home to tell me he's seen
such luminaries as Pat Boone and Montel Williams padding around the
locker room in the altogether.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, nothing compares to the time I saw Monica Lewinsky
purse shopping at Barneys while Shannen Doherty tried on jeans just a
few feet away. But that's a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Like Kohoutek.</TE>
<TE>   Pay-Per-View Challenge: Every Friday, DirecTV adds a few more
movies to their pay-per-view lineup. My husband and I eagerly scan
the listings for the most god-awful films they have to offer. The
challenge is to see how much we can take, and who will wimp out
first. "Wimping out" is defined as dozing off, picking up a magazine
or leaving the room entirely. I'm sorry to say I have a much lower
threshold than he does, and have bailed on such dogs as "The Wedding
Planner," "Stigmata," "The General's Daughter" and "Six Days, Seven
Nights." There is only one rule: no Kate Hudson movies. That would
give him an unfair advantage, as I immediately fall asleep whenever
she appears on screen.</TE>
<TE>   Gourmet Courier: Only one thing can make a great weekend perfect,
and that's never having to leave your house. Trust me on this. I've
been outside, and it's not all it's cracked up to be. Fortunately,
there's Gourmet Courier. It's perfect for people like me, who would
rather gouge their own eyes out than go to a restaurant on Saturday
night. Gourmet Courier goes to some of the best restaurants in Los
Angeles. They give you the full menus of more than 20 places, and if
you don't like any of those, you can send them wherever you like. The
food is delivered by courteous, friendly drivers within the hour.
That means I can sit around in dirty pajamas, eating crab cakes from
Kate Mantilini, while the dogs snore on the couch and my husband
dares me to watch "Corky Romano." By me, that's heaven.</TE>

<HD>Karrin Allyson a Winning Bet at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Singer Karrin Allyson's Grammy nomination in the jazz vocal category
earlier this year didn't result in an actual award. But it did signal
her arrival at the top level of the genre.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday night at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, Allyson, making one of her
regular appearances at the venue, offered an opening set that amply
illustrated both the quality and the variety of her art.</LD>
<LD>   Allyson did not--as is the case with many performers--use her
appearance as an opportunity to hype her latest album, the
soon-to-be-released "In Blue" (Concord Jazz). Although she included a
few tunes from the new CD--Bobby Timmons' "Moanin' " and Blossom
Dearie's "Bye Bye Country Boy" among them--she also peppered the set
with material reaching across the full extent of her far-ranging
musical interests.</LD>
<TE>   Allyson's appeal is based on a relaxed, attractive onstage
demeanor; superb musicality; an intuitive sense of what material best
fits her style; and a natural feeling for jazz's rhythmic
undercurrent.</TE>
<TE>   All those qualities were on display Tuesday night. Garbed in an
elegant black pantsuit, her blond hair in her characteristic boyish
bob, Allyson alternately roved the stage or accompanied herself on
Catalina's new nine-foot Yamaha piano. She wittily opened "Moanin' "
with a few blues cries of her own, and found the humor in "Bye Bye
Country Boy." The bossa nova classic "O Pato" was delivered with
marvelously lighthearted buoyancy, subtly driven by the guitar work
of Danny Embrey. And Allyson's poignant version of "Good Morning,
Heartache" affirmed her ability--even when dealing with a factor as
powerful as Billie Holiday's association with the song--to find her
own distinctive path.</TE>
<TE>   She was well aided by her longtime associate Embrey, as well as
pianist Bill Cunliffe, bassist Tom Warrington and drummer Joe
LaBarbera. But Allyson was the show, and her talent portends that a
Grammy win should be just a matter of time.</TE>

<HD>Azure Ray Makes a Quiet Entrance</HD>
<DH>This duo almost seems to be whispering secrets. Working
with Moby helps them to be heard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Moby had the duo Azure Ray come to his New York home studio to
sing on his recent "18" album, all was fine except for one thing.</LD>
<LD>   "They are the nicest people in the world," he says of Orenda Fink
and Maria Taylor. "The only difficulty in working with them is that
they sing so quietly I had to use a very special microphone
specifically designed for really quiet sounds."</LD>
<LD>   Taylor laughs when she's told of Moby's comment.</LD>
<TE>   "He just had this one microphone for us," she says. "Orenda and I
had to stand close together and sing in his tiny apartment."</TE>
<TE>   But they do sing very quietly regardless of the circumstances. On
their two albums and one EP, their voices are hushed, sounding as if
they're whispering right into your ear.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with spare, haunting music and sad, personal lyrics, it's
a highly intimate experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's just an aesthetic choice," Taylor says. "Just the
songs and melodies and words, it never would have crossed our minds
to sing it loud. We're singing almost like secrets."</TE>
<TE>   The secrets are starting to get out. In addition to co-writing and
singing "Great Escape" on Moby's album, Azure Ray will be the opening
act for the electronica star, joining his tour Sunday in Dallas.
They've also become valuable utility players on the burgeoning
indie-rock scene in Omaha, where they have just relocated from
Athens, Ga. They'll be performing with Omaha band Bright Eyes and its
spinoff, Now It's Overhead, on summer and fall tours, serving as band
members and opening the shows as Azure Ray.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Taylor and Fink, both 26, are expecting an onslaught of
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "So far nothing's changed," Fink says. "The phone's not ringing.
This is the first interview I've done since the [Moby] album came
out.... And it's funny to read on Moby's Web board how many people
don't realize that he didn't write the song. And how many people
think that Sinead O'Connor sings it. I've even read that in
magazines. But I don't care."</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, Azure Ray's existence has been as low-key and
personal as the music. The two have been making music together since
they met in high school in Birmingham, Ala. They eventually formed a
band, Little Red Rocket, which in 1997 released one album on
independent Tim/Kerr Records before Geffen Records signed them. But
roster trimming in the wake of corporate mergers led to the band's
being dropped before it made an album for the company. Moving to
Athens, they soldiered on, recording a second album that was released
in 2000 on another indie label, Monolyth.</TE>
<TE>   "Then our emotional states took a turn," Fink says. "It was a lot
of personal stuff. We both went through different situations where we
had our hearts destroyed for the first time. And while we were
writing and playing this pop music that was fun, we were also sitting
in our rooms by ourselves writing these really sad songs on acoustic
guitar and playing them for each other behind closed doors."</TE>
<TE>   They didn't intend to take this music public, but when they
finally did last year, the response was enthusiastic. Brian Causey,
owner of the tiny Athens label Warm, offered to release their music,
with Eric Bachmann (of the bands Archers of Loaf and Crooked Fingers)
stepping in as producer and crafting the music's distinctive
atmospheres. The debut album, "Azure Ray," was released in late 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "When it came out, it really seemed to hit the forefront for us,
and we decided this is where we're at anyway, so we broke up Little
Red Rocket," Fink says.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Omaha label Saddle Creek Records released the
EP "November," and last month Warm followed it with the album "Burn
and Shiver." Sales haven't been huge--about 5,000 for the first album
and 4,000 so far for the new one--but Fink and Taylor are content
with the state of their career. The exposure from the Moby tour
stands to broaden their audience. And the move to Omaha (home of
Fink's boyfriend, Todd Baechle, singer in the band the Faint) has
cemented their place in a supportive music community.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not that sad anymore," says Fink.</TE>
<TE>   Will that affect the music?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to get into the thing where we have to play only sad
music and conjure up those emotions," she says. "It will be
changing."</TE>

<LD>   " 'Master Harold' ... and the boys"--International City Theatre's
vibrant revival prompts renewed appreciation for the power and poetry
of Athol Fugard's writing. Fugard once explained in an interview that
two people had profoundly influenced his writing about injustice and
the dream of future healing. One was his mother, who "kept alive in
me--when society was trying to blunt it--a sense of what is right and
wrong." The other was Sam Semela, a black man who worked for Fugard's
family.</LD>
<LD>   Sam is one of the waiters in "Master Harold"; Fugard himself is
the boy, Hally; and his mother, though unseen, calls with the news
that speeds the play toward its shattering climax. As Sam, Leon
Morenzie stands tall, moves with grace and speaks with crisp wit and
insight. No wonder Travis Vaden's Hally adores him, his eyes
narrowing with pleasure every time Sam lobs him an intellectual
challenge. As Willie, the other waiter, Gregg Daniel watches and
reacts to Hally and Sam's interactions, a sort of theatrical stand-in
for South Africa itself.</LD>
<TE>   Under caryn morse desai's direction, the action flows along on
waves of goodwill until Hally gets some bad news and explosively
lashes out at a convenient and socially sanctioned target: Sam.</TE>

4Entertainment/Crawfords Australia/Warner Home Video. VHS: $15. DVD:
$20. Ages 8 to 12. www.saddleclubtv .com/ or www.warnervideo.com/</LD>
<LD>   DreamWorks' "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" isn't the only
golden viewing opportunity for horse-loving "tweener" girls ages 8 to
12. They can saddle up with this well-produced, feature-length
release based on the bestselling book series "The Saddle Club" and
"Pine Hollow," by Bonnie Bryant. (The TV series can be seen on the
Discovery Kids cable channel.)</LD>
<TE>   Filmed in Australia and set in and around a fab riding stable in
the midst of gorgeous green fields and forests, the movie centers on
three 12-year-old best friends, Stevie, Carole and Lisa.</TE>
<TE>   Along with training sessions with a hunk of a riding coach,
preparing for competitions and riding, grooming and communing with
their horses, the three girls deal with rich and spoiled Veronica, a
fledgling interest in boys and, in Carole's case, angst over whether
to be a veterinarian like her late mother.</TE>
<TE>   To all this, add handsome young stable hands, Carole's dreamboat
dad, a friendly female horse doctor, a stallion's tragic death, a
foal's birth and loads of equine pulchritude on parade.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a guide to horses, the girls' chipper pop music
video "Hello World," bios and more.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A visit to a Groundlings sketch comedy show is one of L.A.'s great
all-purpose activities. On a date? With friends? Family visiting from
out of town? Go to the Groundlings; they can tickle laughter out of
most everyone.</LD>
<LD>   Some nights are better than others, of course. It all depends on
who's in the talent pipeline (the next Will Ferrell or Cheri Oteri?)
and what they've concocted.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's performance of "Groundlings Drive-In," the current
showcase for the company's most promising members, managed to put the
crowd in a giggly mood, mostly because performers Christian Duguay,
Rachel Duguay, Rachael Harris, Steven Pierce, Jim Rash, Jeremy
Rowley, Mitch Silpa and Amy Von Freymann pushed their
characterizations to outrageous extremes. But their sketch ideas left
something to be desired.</LD>
<TE>   The best of these 16 sketches--under Deanna Oliver's
direction--dealt with airport security, a brave choice for a
performance less than 36 hours after the July 4 killings at LAX.
Looking goofy in a wardrobe several decades out of date, Rowley
became a whiny passenger bogging down a checkpoint, protesting, "I
don't haaave anythiiing"--in a voice pitched so high it could have
shattered glass--and fearfully whimpering "ow-ow-ow" as a security
wand passed over him.</TE>
<TE>   Von Freymann also scored laughs as a make-over queen out to put
"the 'you' in unique" while herself looking rather too unique. (Think
a red-haired Elvira in a long, leopard-print coat.)</TE>
<TE>   Too many ideas were shopworn, though: the Andy Kaufman-type
foreigner who mangles English; the male friendship that mirrors a
dating cycle; the woman going through a bad breakup who makes a
change by trying to hook up with a lesbian. In five improv segments,
the comedians also stuck to well-traveled territory.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case with sketch comedy, the funniest part of the
show was how ill-matched the title was to the material. "Drive-In"?
Don't even try to figure it out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Groundlings Drive-In," the Groundling Theatre, 7307 Melrose Ave.,
L.A. Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 8 and 10 p.m. Indefinitely. $18.50.
(323) 934-9700. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   The Boss Revisits Old Haunt For L.A. Date</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band have chosen an old, familiar
stage for their Aug. 24 return to Southern California: the Forum, a
venue the band last visited in 1978.</LD>
<TE>   The band on Wednesday announced dates in 46 cities for its reunion
tour, which kicks off in East Rutherford, N.J., on Aug. 7. More shows
will probably be added during the run, which is expected to stretch
into the summer of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The group's new album, "The Rising," hits stores July 30, and they
will perform live that morning on NBC's "Today." Tickets for the
Forum show go on sale Sunday. The floor level will be
general-admission festival seating.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen's last two L.A. performances were at Staples Center,
which he inaugurated in October 1999, playfully pointing out that
there were "too many sky boxes."</TE>

<TE>   Ozawa Can't Get Over the Green ($) Monster</TE>
<TE>   Seiji Ozawa, the departing Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor who
once wore a Red Sox jersey onstage, had a great idea for his grand
finale: As a gift to the city in which he worked for 29 years, he
said, he would lead the band in a free concert at Fenway Park this
summer. After he pitched the idea to the new Red Sox owners, the club
set aside July 20 as the tentative date, when the team would be on
the road.</TE>
<TE>   But according to the Boston Globe, organizers have struck out in
their efforts to make the event a reality.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestra managing director Mark Volpe estimated that it would
cost at least $500,000 to build a stage, install a sound system and
provide other support for the show.</TE>
<TE>   Because there's not enough room for trucks to enter the stadium,
much of the equipment would have to be carried in.</TE>
<TE>   "Piece by piece by piece, you're talking about a massive
construction job," Volpe said. "Half a million is a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Ozawa, who will take over the Vienna State Opera in the fall, will
instead say his goodbyes to the Boston crowd at the Tanglewood Music
Festival, summer home of the Boston Symphony, this weekend.</TE>

<TE>   Wearing the "Gay Mafia" Tag Proudly</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to make a quick buck, a 38-year-old independent
producer and graphic designer is milking a controversial remark about
Hollywood's alleged "gay mafia" made by power broker Michael Ovitz.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Sikes, who has never met the former agent, says he designed
the "Gay Mafia" T-shirts as a "gag ... and a jab at not just Ovitz,
but all the Ovitzes out there."</TE>
<TE>   The black cotton Ts, with white lettering in the style of Mario
Puzo's "The Godfather," feature a marionette over the letter G.
Almost as soon as he put the item on EBay, Sikes says, he received
100 orders from all over the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The incendiary phrase was used by Ovitz in a tell-all Vanity Fair
interview, published last week, that has become the talk of the town.
In it, he blamed his career's demise on the existence of Hollywood's
"gay mafia"--a statement for which he has since apologized.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Guitarist Eddie Van Halen and actress Valerie Bertinelli have
announced they secretly separated nearly 10 months ago after 20 years
of marriage. It is not clear whether they intend to divorce....
Sharon Osbourne, wife of British heavy-metal icon Ozzy Osbourne and
co-star of the MTV series "The Osbournes," has been released from a
Los Angeles-area hospital after undergoing colon cancer surgery.
According to a family spokeswoman, the disease is in its early stages
and a full recovery is expected.... Dennis Miller is folding his HBO
series "Dennis Miller Live" after nine seasons and five Emmys....
Martin Scorsese, Robert Towne, Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher, composer
Marc Shaiman and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski will be honored with
Hollywood Outstanding Achievement Awards during the closing night of
the Hollywood Film Festival on Oct 7.... CNN's international outlet,
CNNi, will broadcast a version of Jon Stewart's "The Daily Show" to

<HD>Academy of Sciences Transforms</HD>
<DH>Architecture* The San Francisco facility unveils Renzo
Piano's plan for a $370-million revamping.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Academy of Sciences unveiled an ambitious design
Wednesday for a planned $370-million expansion and renovation of its
existing complex in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.</LD>
<LD>   The design, by Italian architect Renzo Piano, will transform a
sprawling complex that now includes a dozen mismatched buildings
built up over 80 years into a more compact cluster of buildings that
will include the academy's planetarium, aquarium and natural history
museum, with 140,000 square feet of exhibition space--all contained
under a massive undulating roof.</LD>
<LD>   The California Academy of Sciences project marks Piano's first
major commission on the West Coast.</LD>
<TE>   Museum officials have so far raised $220 million for the project.
They hope to break ground in early 2004, with completion in early
2008. The academy is searching for a temporary home for the bulk of
its exhibitions while the main complex is shut down for construction.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1853, the California Academy of Sciences moved from
Market Street to its current location in Golden Gate Park in 1916,
after its original building was destroyed in the 1906 fire. Its main
campus includes three Beaux Arts structures, built between 1916 and
1931, and a number of modern additions that were tacked on during the
1950s and 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Piano's proposal would remove the later additions and parts of the
original Beaux Arts structures. The 1916 building would be torn down
and replaced by a similar, Beaux Arts-inspired structure designed by
Piano; the 1931 African Hall will be renovated, as would be the
barrel-vaulted ceiling and columned facade of the 1923 Steinhart
Aquarium.</TE>
<TE>   A new building would house the administrative offices, research
labs and collections facilities. Together, these structures would
frame an immense internal court. The idea is to create a
self-contained village that includes a mix of historical periods and
functions.</TE>
<TE>   The plan's most distinctive feature is a gigantic "living roof"
whose form will drape over these various structures. Conceived as a
sort of natural carpet, the roof will support a series of indigenous
gardens and a small, rooftop viewing area.</TE>
<TE>   The roof is intended to reflect the soft, enveloping contours of
the surrounding parkscape. But it also serves an ecological function.
Its shape is designed to catch the breezes drifting in from the
nearby ocean, flooding the interior with natural ventilation and
light. Much of the structure's perimeter, meanwhile, will open to the
surrounding parkscape.</TE>
<TE>   "The sense of urban complexity was already there, and we did not
want to lose that," Piano said in a telephone interview from San
Francisco. "It has the quality of a little town. I put the roof, like
a piece of textile, over these functions."</TE>
<TE>   Piano ranks among the world's most celebrated architectural
talents. He is perhaps best known for the design of Paris' 1978
Pompidou Center in collaboration with the British-born architect
Richard Rogers. The structure's bold industrial aesthetic, with its
facade of over-scaled, brightly colored pipes, was considered radical
for its time and remains one of the city's most beloved landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Piano has gone on to articulate an architectural
language known for its remarkable structural delicacy and humanist
bent. With its delicate, louvered roof and domestic scale, for
example, the Menil Collection building in Houston is considered one
of the world's most beautiful and contemplative museum spaces. More
recently, he has designed the Kansai International Airport, a long,
slender terminal building encased in a steel-and-glass shell that is
set on a man-made island in Osaka Bay, Japan, completed in 1994. In
the United States, he is designing an office tower for the New York
Times and the renovation of the Morgan Library, both in Manhattan.</TE>

<LD>Getting Pan-Asian on La Cienega: Koi, which opened in the former
Drai's location in May, is attracting crowds with its fireside lounge
and bamboo-decorated patio. On weekends, some wait up to an hour for
bite-sized crispy rice with spicy tuna (Koi sells 80 to 100 orders a
night) and other pan-Asian offerings (there are five sushi chefs).
Executive chef Rod Aglibot was the sous-chef under Joyce Goldstein at
E &amp; O Trading Company in San Francisco. Nick and Dipu Haque, the
brothers who own Koi, have invested in other Los Angeles restaurants
(Atlantic, El Dorado), but this is their first place of their own.
Nick Haque says, "I have only one problem here--people won't leave."</LD>

<LD>Years from now, as you're watching the dinosaur races from Hollywood
Park on TV while your pet dodo snoozes contentedly at your feet, you
might think back to '02 and the band of audacious Aussies who helped
make the whole concept of species extinction extinct.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at 10, you'll meet that group in a Learning Channel
special with an unmistakable "Jurassic Park" flavor, except that "End
of Extinction: Cloning the Tasmanian Tiger" purports to be science
fact, not fiction.</LD>
<LD>   The premise is that the evolutionary biology unit at the
Australian Museum has recently overcome a crucial obstacle in its
three-year effort to bring back to life the thylacine, a species
extinct since 1936.</LD>
<TE>   Heading the effort is the museum's charismatic director,
paleontologist Mike Archer, who lays out the details of the effort
with such clarity and confidence that one can't help but think he
might actually pull this off.</TE>
<TE>   In a nutshell, the research group has extracted DNA from a
preserved Tasmanian tiger pup, a striped, wolf-like marsupial that
was hunted to extinction. Replication of its DNA has been achieved,
and now the task is to copy all the genes of the Tasmanian tiger so
they can be used to construct synthetic chromosomes. If successful,
the team says new cubs could be created by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   What happens next is anyone's guess.</TE>

<LD>Concurrent festivals offer the dedicated filmgoer an embarrassment of
riches this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to Outfest, the Los Angeles edition of the New York
Independent Film &amp; Video Festival commences tonight at the Fairfax
Cinemas and Raleigh Studios, and the Dances With Film Festival,
another showcase for independents, begins Friday at the Monica
4-Plex.</LD>
<LD>   Screening Tuesday at 6 p.m. at the Fairfax is acclaimed
photographer David Turnley's stunning black-and-white "La Tropical,"
which takes its title from an outdoor dance hall on the outskirts of
Havana. A venerable mecca for impoverished black Cubans, it is at
once the cradle for several generations of Afro-Cuban music and a way
for those who dance to it to express themselves, connect with others
and escape hard lives for an evening. Internationally acclaimed
groups like Los Van Van can draw from 4,000 to 6,000 people;
weeknight revues attract from 250 to 500 people.</LD>
<TE>   Not merely an intoxicatingly sensual celebration of Afro-Cuban
music and dance, "La Tropical" also delves into the lives of its
participants, presenting a wide range of views of life under Castro,
whose revolution is seen as bettering the status of blacks yet is the
source of continuing oppression and despair. "La Tropical" is at once
haunting and beautiful. (323) 363-5096.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz Vocalist Scott Overcame Obstacles</TE>
<TE>   Screening Tuesday at the Egyptian at 7:30 p.m. is the American
Cinematheque's presentation of Matthew Buzzell's "Jimmy Scott: If You
Only Knew," a wonderful documentary on the great jazz vocalist who
turns 77 on Wednesday. Framed by clips of Scott in concert on a
Japanese tour and at the Jazz Bakery in Culver City, the film is full
of insights from friends, family, colleagues and above all from the
man himself.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Scott tells us the importance of learning how "not to
let the bad overwhelm the good." In his case, this is no small trick.
Born in Cleveland as one of 10 children with an often absent father,
Scott at 12 was diagnosed with Kallman's disease, a rare hormonal
disease that arrests puberty and is the reason for his trademark high
voice; seven months later his mother was killed, struck by a car as
she shoved her daughter to safety.</TE>
<TE>   Having known "the importance of having someone who wants you to
succeed in life," Scott was eager to pass on to his younger siblings
what his mother had given him. When he and his siblings were
dispersed to various foster homes, Scott became driven to reunite his
family--a drive that propelled him into his singing career. He had
initial success featured with Lionel Hampton's band, but bad luck and
the exploitation shared by countless black recording artists of his
generation dogged him into oblivion in the '60s, and he was not
rediscovered until the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   The past decade has seen Scott record and perform all over the
world, and it is gratifying to see that Scott, whose slender build
belies a man of tremendous wisdom, spiritual strength and energy, so
gratefully and deservedly enjoying every minute of it.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, Buzzell and Brian Gerber, one of the film's producers, will
discuss the film following its screening. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art presents Laura Betti's new "Pier Paolo Pasolini and the Reason of
a Dream," an inspired and imaginative impressionistic documentary
that, rather than charting the career of the late iconoclastic
Italian director in traditional fashion, evokes what the man and his
life were like through a dynamically assembled array of largely
archival footage, incorporating clips from his films whenever
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   A confidante of Pasolini, who also directed her in a number of
films, Betti has created a collage of images that is a stunning
achievement in its own right. She has furthermore linked them to the
torrent of words Pasolini spoke throughout his adult life in myriad
interviews and lectures. What emerges is a portrait of a brilliant
intellectual and artist, an admired and influential poet and literary
critic drawn to film because of its expression of Italian culture and
its possibilities as a new form of poetry. Pasolini (1922-1975) was
also a political activist, a Marxist and open homosexual whose films
continually ran afoul of censors.</TE>
<TE>   Betti's film presupposes a familiarity with Pasolini's frequently
mystical and ribald fables and epics, and for his admirers it is
indeed an enriching pleasure. Betti repeats images of human
suffering, of people foraging in a garbage heap, finally showing
Pasolini surveying an immense dump himself. By then she has
effectively communicated the sense of despair that increasingly
overcame Pasolini and suffused his notorious final film, a graphic
adaptation of De Sade's "Salo" reset in Mussolini's Italy and
containing some of the most profoundly disturbing images ever filmed
by a major filmmaker.</TE>
<TE>   At age 53, he was brutally murdered by a 17-year-old--possibly
with accomplices--he may have tried to pick up. Accompanied by four
rarely seen Pasolini shorts. (323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   Speculative Film on the 'Singing Nun'</TE>
<TE>   Back in late 1963, a Belgian nun known only as Soeur Sourire, or
Sister Smile, topped America's pop music charts with the relentlessly
cheerful tune "Dominique," from an album of 12 songs that sold 1.5
million copies. From the little that is known of the ill-fated nun's
life, Italy-based American writer-director Roger Deutsch has made the
boldly speculative yet persuasive Italian-language film "Suor
Sorriso" (Tuesday at 7:15 p.m. at the Monica 4-Plex) in which the nun
(Ginevra Colonna) emerges as a tormented, unstable woman who abruptly
left the convent after her recording triumph before taking her final
vows. Running a shelter for wayward girls, she and another ex-nun
(Simona Caparrini) enter a passionate, tumultuous and destructive
affair.</TE>
<TE>   Colonna's volcanic Deckers craves spiritual redemption as well as
the other woman's love but is so beset by demons that she embarks on
a flamboyant, drug-fueled downward spiral that ultimately engulfs her
lover as well as herself. This is the same woman portrayed by Debbie
Reynolds in the popular 1966 film "The Singing Nun." (323) 850-2929.</TE>
<TE>   'Ondine' Introduces Two Warhol Figures</TE>
<TE>   The Museum of Contemporary Art's Warhol on Screen series continues
Friday at 7 p.m. at the Pacific Design Center with "The Loves of
Ondine" (1967-68), a rambling, 85-minute mishmash notable only for
its introduction of two Warhol icons, Viva and Joe D'Allesandro. The
film's title refers to Bob Olivio's Ondine, who also appeared in
"Chelsea Girls."</TE>
<TE>   Screening Wednesday at 7 p.m. is "I, a Man" (1967), which answers
rather than emulates the then-notorious Swedish sexploitation
picture, "I, a Woman." In the series of eight sexual encounters that
Warhol's likable, self-knowing hero (Tom Baker) experiences during
the film's 110 minutes, only the concluding episode's phlegmatic and
earthy woman seems worthy of him. There is a pervasive sadness in the
picture, which is typical of Warhol, with bursts of corrosive humor.
There is more nudity in this film than in "I, a Woman," but Warhol
treats it casually and discreetly; the Swedish film is a fantasy to
which Warhol replies with a sense of realism. The influence of Paul
Morrissey, who began directing for Warhol with "Chelsea Girls,"
reveals a growing concern for structure and technique.(213) 621-1745.</TE>
<TE>   Tribute to Chronicler of Rock Music Scene</TE>
<TE>   At the Egyptian this weekend, the American Cinematheque presents
"She Sold Her Soul to Rock 'n' Roll: An In-Person Tribute to Penelope
Spheeris." It calls attention to a dynamic, stylish filmmaker who can
always be counted upon to bring a witty and satirical edge to
mainstream Hollywood pictures, while continuing to chronicle the rock
music scene with energy and perception. A concern for the lives,
passions and challenges facing young people runs throughout Spheeris'
career, including her student years at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Screening Friday at 7 p.m. is a new 35-millimeter print of "The
Decline of Western Civilization" (1981), her prescient account of the
emerging L.A. punk-rock movement. "Wayne's World" (1992) screens at
10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday brings at 5 p.m. "Suburbia" (1984) and "The Decline of
Western Civilization Part III" (1998).</TE>
<TE>   Screening at 9:30 is a sneak preview of "We Sold Our Souls for
Rock 'n' Roll," an account of the onstage and offstage happenings of
Ozzfest, the traveling heavy metal circus featuring Ozzy Osbourne and
others.(323) 466-FILM.</TE>

<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With more than 70 feature films over 12 days, not to mention nearly
100 shorts, Outfest can be a tough festival to navigate. Do you
sacrifice the "Xanadu" sing-along to catch the documentary on AIDS
activism in South Africa?</LD>
<LD>   We asked film reviewer Kevin Thomas to survey the offerings and
tell us which films are not to be missed. His recommendations:</LD>
<LD>   AKA--Inspired by Mike Figgis' split-screen technique in
"Timecode," writer-director Duncan Roy employs simultaneous triptych
images, to stunning effect, to trace a young opportunist's rise and
fall amid the British upper classes in the late '70s. The images
express the complexity and treachery of the world that working-class
Dean (Matthew Leitch) has infiltrated out of sheer frustration and
desperation. In no time, he's off to Paris, passing himself off as
the son of a titled London gallery owner (Diana Quick) and catching
the eye of a rich American (George Asprey), only to discover
ultimately that he has deceived only himself. July 20, 7 p.m., at the
Directors Guild Theater 1, 7920 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Guardian of the Frontier--The first Slovenian film directed by a
woman, Maja Weiss--and a remarkable feature debut--is a suspense
drama in which three students, blond Simona (Iva Krajnc), brunet Zana
(Pia Zemljic) and auburn Alja (Tanja Potocnik) take a summertime
canoe journey down the Kolpa River, which divides Slovenia and
Croatia. They find themselves up against borders political and sexual
as they go deeper into a conservative countryside where a politician
(Jonas Nidarski) preaches Slovenia for the Slovenians and traditional
family values. This doesn't stop Zana's open pursuit of Alja, who's
gone sour on her boyfriend, while the homophobic Simona finds herself
attracted to the macho politico. Weiss boldly evokes fantasy and
symbolism in a bravura climactic sequence that is provocatively
ambiguous. July 19, 7 p.m., at the Directors Guild Theater 1.</TE>
<TE>   Lan Yu--The festival's closing-night film, one of Hong Kong
director Stanley Kwan's finest, is a poignant love story set in
Beijing in the late '80s, a time of political repression and equally
ruthless economic expansion. Hu Jun stars as Handong, a forceful,
hard-driving owner of a fast-growing trading company who crosses
paths with a young architectural student, Lan Yu (Liu Ye), fresh from
the countryside. They commence an affair in which Handong is generous
to the impoverished youth with everything except his heart. As the
men move in and out of each other's lives and time and events go by,
Handong at last seems ready to act on the love he has felt for Lan Yu
all along. July 22, 8 p.m., at Showcase Theatre, 614 N. La Brea Ave.,
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Bob &amp; Rose--Written by Russell T. Davies (creator of "Queer as
Folk") and directed by Julian Farino and Joe Wright, "Bob &amp; Rose" is
highly entertaining throughout its six hours. Like the original
"Queer as Folk," it is set in Manchester, but only partly in the
city's gay area, Canal Street, because it deals with an out and
self-accepting gay schoolteacher in his early 30s (Alan Davies) and a
straight woman, a forthright office manager (Lesley Sharp), who are
stunned to discover they are falling in love with each other. The
subplots aren't free of soap opera contrivance, but the running time
gives Davies and Sharp a terrific opportunity to explore the
challenges facing Bob and Rose. Saturday, 1:30 p.m., at the DGA
Theater 1. Special price: $15.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth &amp; Connie: Every Room in the House--No wonder Deborah
Dickson's documentary is the festival's centerpiece film, screening
at its halfway mark. In a mere 56 minutes, Ruth Berman and Connie
Kurtz, a pair of plump, hearty Brooklyn Jewish grandmothers who
appear to be in their late 60s, tell us how they met and became best
friends in 1959 and lovers in 1974. Theirs is a love story that
overcame obstacles from within themselves and from without--and at a
price: the breakup of their marriages and the enduring estrangement
of Berman's son. Of him, she says that if he's happy that's all that
matters. If being excluded from his life is key to his happiness,
she'll accept that, no matter how painful. As they celebrate a
quarter-century together, the irresistible Ruth and Connie remain
lively activists and seasoned counselors, and Dickson's film reflects
their warmth and wisdom. Tuesday, 7:15 p.m., at the DGA Theater 1.
Also July 18 at the Renberg Theatre, the Village at Ed Gould Plaza,
1125 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Flora's Garment Bursting Into Bloom--There is a tremendous raw
poetic power in Kevin Baggott's film, in which he plays a struggling,
hard-living working-class Irish American writer who's been dumped by
his lover of nine years. He's drawn to a feisty, proud but
drug-abusing prostitute, Flora (Jenette Sampson), whom he does not at
first realize is a transsexual but falls in love with her anyway,
thus embarking on a romance that is inevitably as rocky as it is
passionate. Friday, 9:45 p.m. at the DGA Theater 2. Also July 18, 5
p.m. at the Village at Ed Gould Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Luster--Everett Lewis' film is a skittishly bittersweet study of a
group of gay L.A. twentysomethings for whom sexual orientation is a
nonissue. With no social brakes on their emotions, they--like many of
their straight counterparts--lead with their hearts and still have
faith in love at first sight, no matter how one-sided. The central
figure is Justin Herwick's tall, skinny, nice-looking Jackson.
Friday, 9:30 p.m. at DGA Theater 1.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scenes of country living and open spaces await visitors to the
Ventura County Museum of History and Art, along with a sobering
subtext. Welcome home, Ventura County-ites, to the Santa Clara
Valley, a last refuge of relatively undeveloped life in Southern
California and a controversial hotspot for potential
mega-development. Blink and you may miss it.</LD>
<LD>   Artists in the area have long relished the rural aspects of the
landscape, treasuring its natural scenery and small-town charms. The
stance of this exhibition is pointedly preservationist, a common
issue for Ellen Easton, who runs the idyllic Easton Gallery in
Montecito and has published several art books, including a handsome
volume on this work. Easton's sensibility leans toward landscape
work, especially that which implicitly celebrates and pleads for the
conservation of the nature on view.</LD>
<LD>   The terrain binds these artists more than style concerns. Rolling
clouds over ridged brown masses of hills give Kevin Turcotte's
"Clouds Near County Line" its celestial air, while Richard Schloss'
painterly dramatics are more sweeping in nature, taking in a broad
view in "Orcutt Palms and South Mountain" and "Santa Paula Creek."</LD>
<TE>   Patricia Chidlaw, Santa Barbara's cheerier descendant of the
Edward Hopper style, is famously fond of long light and unpopulated
streets. She brings that eye to scenes of Santa Paula, from the lazy,
shadowed simplicity of "Sunday Morning" to the iconic ode to a fruit
truck, "Sunkist, Fillmore." In her characteristic way, Meredith
Brooks Abbott pays fond tribute to meaningful old structures, with
"Botke Studio, Wheeler Canyon" and "Bunk House, Sespe Ranch."</TE>
<TE>   Glenna Hartmann's pastel work "Spring Afternoon, Piru" takes in
the springtime greenery, craggy rock formations and a mere smattering
of human presence below. Another scene from that neighborhood, Gail
Pidduck's "Becera's Market, Piru" gives due attention to a humble
landmark, as does Michael Enriquez's "Bardsdale Methodist Church," a
lovely accounting of a hidden architectural jewel in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Arturo Teller has his sights on the perceived enemy of
the unspoiled scenery in "Timber Canyon Builder," a bulldozer
painting as seen from a literally tilted, clearly biased angle. It's
hard not to side with the anti-development case, given the visual
evidence provided by a show such as this. Whether it has any effect
in abating growth remains to be seen. For now, the artists have
championed a happy reality just a short drive away on California 126.</TE>
<TE>   * "Painting the Santa Clara Valley," Ventura County Museum of
History and Art, 100 E. Main St., Ventura. Ends Sept. 1. Tue.-Sun.,
10 a.m.-5 p.m. (805) 653-0323.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neo-Woodstock on Wheels: The Vans Warped Tour is more than a
concert extravaganza; it's a mobile lifestyle channel in real time,
coming Friday to a fairgrounds near you. Extreme sports meets
post-punk bands and other raucous sounds, in a controlled environment
equal parts circus, post-Woodstock rock fest and shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   On multiple stages at Seaside Park, the Vans Warped Tour returns
to Ventura with a lineup that includes Bad Religion, NOFX, Something
Corporate, Reel Big Fish, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Lagwagon, Flogging
Molly, No Use for a Name and countless more. Athletic sideshows
include skateboarding, skaters, BMXers, in-liners, motocrossers and

<LD>Legionnaires' disease--In some editions of the July 3 California
section, a photo caption incorrectly reported that Charles Griego
died of Legionnaires' disease at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los
Angeles. Griego contracted the disease at the hospital, but doctors
there say he did not die of it. His death certificate lists the
primary cause of death as a heart ailment. In other editions, a photo
caption incorrectly implied that Griego's children had just learned
that their father died after heart surgery. In fact, they had just
learned of their father's infection with hospital- acquired
Legionnaires' disease.</LD>

<LD>Duke of Norfolk obituary--A June 27 obituary of the 17th duke of
Norfolk incorrectly stated that the Howard family, to which the duke
belonged, had kept its Catholic faith despite King Henry VIII's break
with the Roman Catholic Church. In fact, several of the duke's
predecessors were Protestants. The obituary also did not give a full
history of the creation of the dukedom. Although the first duke of
Norfolk in the Howard family was designated in 1483 by King Richard
III, as the Associated Press story reported, a previous duke of
Norfolk had been created in 1397 by King Richard II, who banished him
in 1398.</LD>

<HD>Boeing Plans to Merge Space, Defense Units</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Executives say the change will position the
company to go after oversight projects for the military.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. said Wednesday that it is merging its Seal Beach-based
space and communications unit with its military aircraft and missile
systems business headquartered in St. Louis, in a move that would
allow the company to pursue a bigger chunk of the growing defense
budget.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing said it would combine the two units into a $23-billion
business under a major realignment that would place all of its
defense-related work under one roof. The combined unit, Integrated
Defense Systems, would be headquartered in St. Louis and led by James
F. Albaugh, president and chief executive of the space and
communications unit.</LD>
<LD>   Because the changes are mainly administrative, no jobs or
facilities are affected, Boeing executives said. Albaugh and a few of
his support staff in Seal Beach will move to St. Louis, but no other
personnel changes are expected. Boeing is the largest private
employer in Southern California, with about 35,000 employees.</LD>
<TE>   Boeing executives said the "strategic realignment" was mainly
designed to improve the company's ability to go after so-called
system-of-systems work, which involves oversight of complex and
lucrative integration tasks on multibillion-dollar defense contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization continues Boeing's quest to rely less on its
commercial aircraft-making business, which has been hammered by the
slowdown in air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In less
than six years, the company has moved from generating about 85% of
its revenue from commercial aircraft to about 60%. Within the next
few years, defense and other work may surpass it, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The new integrated defense systems subsidiary will employ 78,600
workers, more than the company's flagship commercial jet unit, which
is firing about 30,000 workers and slashing production amid the steep
airline slump.</TE>
<TE>   "In simple terms, we are aligning our business today with the way
we believe future systems are going to be designed, acquired and
maintained," Boeing Chairman and Chief Executive Philip M. Condit
said. For instance, Albaugh will head a management team that will be
aligned not by product or program but by customers. Albaugh will
manage separate general managers for programs for the Army, the Air
Force and the Navy, as well as for missile defense and NASA's human
space flight.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Boeing's move reflects a trend within the defense
industry, which has been called on by the Pentagon in recent years to
take a greater role in overseeing development of major programs.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Boeing won a major Army contract, potentially worth $10
billion, to develop a network of new weapons, communication systems
and intelligence-gathering sensors. It marked the first time that the
Army had asked a single defense contractor to oversee development of
a range of technologies and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "They see that as a real growth area," said Paul H. Nisbet, a
defense analyst with JSA Research Inc. "They can do the system
integration work more effectively if they have them combined, rather
than having to work across major divisions."</TE>
<TE>   The trend has fueled many high-profile consolidations in recent
years, including Northrop Grumman Corp.'s proposed acquisition of TRW
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   For Boeing, combining the units would bring together a vast but
disparate empire that provides weapons and systems to the Pentagon,
including fighter jets, battlefield computer systems, satellites and
missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Albaugh said the realignment should benefit operations in Southern
California, where the space and communication unit employs nearly
22,000 people, many of them engineers for the design and development
of the complex systems that Boeing would go after.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing shares fell $2.42 to
$40.80.</TE>

<HD>Merger Plan Fails for Cadiz, Kadco</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK,</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadiz Inc., which is proposing to build a $150-million water storage
facility in the Mojave Desert in partnership with the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California, said Wednesday that its plan
to merge its agricultural operations with those of a wealthy Saudi
prince had fallen through.</LD>
<LD>   The merger with Kingdom Agricultural Development Co., or Kadco,
was an important element of plans to refinance the debt-ridden
operations of Sun World, the Santa Monica-based firm's subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   That would have produced as much as $25 million in cash to the
parent company, Cadiz Chief Executive Keith Brackpool said this
spring. Kadco, which is owned by Prince Al Waleed ibn Talal ibn
Abdulaziz al Saud, is helping to develop a water and agriculture
project sponsored by the Egyptian government near the Nile basin.</LD>
<TE>   Beyond mentioning "technical reasons," Cadiz did not say why the
proposed merger, first announced in January, had broken down.</TE>
<TE>   But Brackpool told investors in May that the deal had run into
regulatory problems with the Egyptian government. Under terms of the
deal, Kadco would have acquired 49.75% of Sun World.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't make sense for either company at this point," Cadiz
spokeswoman Wendy Mitchell said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the merger breakup on the Mojave water project,
which is designed to store up to 1.5 million acre-feet of surplus
Colorado River water for use during dry spells in Southern
California, is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The terms of the proposed deal with the MWD call for Cadiz to
provide half the $150-million construction cost, and the firm has
indicated it would rely on borrowed funds for much of its share.</TE>
<TE>   But Cadiz already is heavily indebted and was counting on the
Kadco merger to provide it with new capital. At the end of last year,
Cadiz reported carrying $141.4 million in debt, compared with
shareholder equity of $17.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz shares Wednesday rose 13 cents to $4.30 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool and other Cadiz executives have said they have been
working on other, unspecified refinancing plans in case the Kadco
deal was not completed soon.</TE>
<TE>   An MWD official said he was unsure how the merger breakdown would
affect the water project but noted that it faces more immediate
hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   The project, which must be approved by the MWD board, is awaiting
final environmental approval from the federal Bureau of Land
Management, which controls some of the acreage surrounding the site
northeast of Palm Springs. That approval, which was expected several
months ago, has been delayed. Last week Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) introduced legislation that would bar the agency from
issuing any approval until some outstanding environmental issues are
resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "The environmental issues probably have a more direct implication
than anything in Cadiz's news release," said Adan Ortega, executive
assistant to MWD Chief Executive Ronald Gastelum.</TE>

the brand. 'Lilo' is a prime example of how its cross-pollination
strategy works.</DH>

<LD>When Walt Disney Co. created a namesake cable channel, it was little
more than a place to charge viewers to watch recycled Disney movies
and old shows such as "Spin and Marty." Nearly two decades later, the
Disney Channel is going head to head with highly successful
Nickelodeon--a ray of good news for a company that has staggered
along in the broadcast industry.</LD>
<LD>   Youngsters who once considered Disney passe are flocking back to
the channel's blend of original movies and series that have become
hip among the pre- and early teens, giving the company another
powerful marketing voice. The latest contributor to the cause: an
upcoming animated series based on Disney's hit movie "Lilo &amp; Stitch,"
which the channel promoted relentlessly.</LD>
<LD>   The movie grossed more than $100 million, nearly beating Tom
Cruise's "Minority Report" as the No. 1 movie on its opening weekend
last month. Disney hopes to extend that success to the small screen
for years to come. The series is scheduled to premiere in the fall of
2003.</LD>
<TE>   "Stitch is one of those unique characters," said Disney Studios
Chairman Dick Cook. "Having a television series just keeps him alive
and allows him to flourish and become embedded in the fabric of our
culture."</TE>
<TE>   Disney previously created series from such movies as "Aladdin" and
"Lion King" that debuted on ABC's "One Saturday Morning" cartoon
block or sold in syndication to other outlets, such as CBS and UPN.
But "Lilo" represents the first time Disney has developed a cartoon
spinoff specifically for its flagship cable channel. Disney
executives and entertainment analysts said that decision is testimony
to the dramatic evolution of the Disney Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a success story for them," said Jordan Rohan, a media
analyst with Wit SoundView. "The channel is one of the most efficient
ways for the company to utilize its brand and, from a financial
perspective, will soon get to the point where it generates more free
cash flow than [Disney] theme parks."</TE>
<TE>   The move also reflects Disney's aggressive efforts to compete
against Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon and AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Cartoon
Network, as kids programming increasingly shifts from network
television to cable TV.</TE>
<TE>   The channel has grown over the last six years from 14 million to
more than 80 million households (excluding another 16 million
internationally) and is emerging as an important driver of the Disney
brand and a key contributor to the company's bottom line. Though
Disney's ABC network continues to struggle from weak ratings and a
fall off in advertising revenue, the Disney Channel's operating
income, derived from cable operator fees, has shown double-digit
growth over the last five years. The channel's worldwide operating
income this year will rise an estimated 14% to $250 million,
according to one analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The catalyst for the channel's growth was a decision a decade ago
to transform the channel from a mostly premium, subscriber-fee cable
service, such as HBO, to a much more widely distributed basic cable
network.</TE>
<TE>   As the channel expanded, so did its mission: It began to develop
its own identity among pre- and early teens with live-action movies
and original series, including "Lizzie McGuire" and "Even Stevens."
The channel also aired music videos promoting teen sensations like
Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Channel further broadened its reach two years ago with
programs targeting the toddler set, such as "Rolie Polie Olie."
Disney Channel, which had never been competitive in that age group,
now is going head to head with Nickelodeon.</TE>
<TE>   The Disney Channel has begun targeting 6- to 11-year-olds with the
animated drama "Kim Possible," which made its debut in June and is
tied with Nickelodeon in that demographic, according to Nielsen Media
Research. Disney hopes to replicate that success with its spinoff of
"Lilo &amp; Stitch." The animated series, scheduled to air in the early
evening hours, is in production and will premiere after the release
of the video sequel.</TE>
<TE>   In overall prime-time ratings, however, Disney Channel ranks
seventh behind Lifetime, Nickelodeon and TNT.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, Disney is drawing on other parts of its business to
promote new shows on the Disney Channel. To help launch "Kim
Possible," for example, Buena Vista Home Entertainment included a
trailer for the series in the video version of "Spy Kids." Radio
Disney, meanwhile, repeatedly played the theme song from the program.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is using the channel not only to launch blitz advertising
campaigns for its feature films--"Lilo" is only the most recent
example--but also as breeding ground for new movies. The Disney
studio is developing two feature movies based on the popular teen
characters from "Lizzie McGuire" and "Even Stevens." In addition,
Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment in August will release a film
based on "Rolie Polie Olie."</TE>
<TE>   Such cross-pollination, in fact, is becoming increasingly common
at other large media companies that are looking to spread their
entertainment across multiple outlets. Viacom, for example, has
developed two movies based on its successful "Rugrats" characters.</TE>
<TE>   The growth of the Disney Channel had made it possible to launch a
television series such as "Stitch," said Anne Sweeney, president of
ABC Cable Networks Group.</TE>
<TE>   "Disney Channel has never been stronger and never been better
positioned to extend a popular franchise like 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' around
the world. We've got the reach and the relationship with kids where
they expect to find great television characters, from Lizzie McGuire
and Kim Possible to Rolie Polie Olie and Stanley to--now--Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   "Lilo" tells the story of a destructive alien who crashed on Earth
and is adopted by a lonely Hawaiian girl. The series, which involves
virtually the entire cast of writers and actors from the movie,
builds on existing characters and will introduce hundreds of new
characters. It's based on a concept that Stitch remains on Earth,
living with Lilo and her sister.</TE>

<HD>Dynacraft Recalls Bicycles</HD>

<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynacraft Industries Inc., a bicycle importer that has been the
target of several product liability suits and recalls in recent
years, is recalling about 4,700 mountain bikes because of defective
forks.</LD>
<LD>   The San Rafael, Calif., company, whose low-priced bicycles were
sold by mass merchandisers such as Target Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
and Toys R Us Inc., has received six reports of the forks breaking
apart, said Kim Dulic, a spokeswoman at the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "There were injuries that included abrasions, cuts, bruises and
broken teeth," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Dynacraft said on its Web site that it was voluntarily recalling
the bikes in conjunction with the federal agency.</TE>
<TE>   The model being recalled, the 24-inch Vertical XL2 mountain bike,
No. 8524-21, was sold at Target stores nationwide from August 1999 to
March 2000 for about $130.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is warning consumers to stop riding the bicycles
immediately and to contact Dynacraft at (800) 288-1560 for
information on receiving a free replacement fork. A fork attaches the
front wheel to the frame.</TE>
<TE>   The company has recalled about 300,000 bikes in 11 product recalls
since 1987. Ten recalls have occurred in the last five years alone.
Problems have included wheels and pedals prone to falling off,
according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Bicycles from Dynacraft are blamed for dozens of injuries,
including lost limbs, concussions and blood clots in the brain,
according to the product safety commission. The company has been
named in 11 product liability suits since 1990, records show. The
status of the cases could not be immediately determined.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Clements, executive director of the National Bicycle Dealers
Assn. in Costa Mesa, which represents generally more expensive
mom-and-pop stores, said low-cost imports often use inferior parts.
Given their susceptibility to breaking, he said, cheap bikes are no
bargain and possibly are even a health hazard.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if there's not a manufacturing defect, we question whether
some of these low-end bikes should be ridden," said Clements, whose
group represents specialty retailers.</TE>
<TE>   The typical bike sold at a mom-and-pop goes for about $350, much
more than those generally carried by mass merchants, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana attorney John Grimm said he is suing on behalf of a client
who lost part of his leg in an accident. Two years ago, Todd Hart,
then 9, was riding a Dynacraft bike down a hill when the brakes
allegedly failed, Grimm said. Hart crashed and his lower left leg was
ripped from his body by a passing cargo van.</TE>
<TE>   Grimm filed a product liability civil suit in March against
Dynacraft and Wal-Mart, which assembled the bike.</TE>

<HD>Genentech Posts Loss on Lawsuit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genentech Inc. on Wednesday posted a second-quarter loss of $213.6
million, or 41 cents a share, stemming from litigation with City of
Hope National Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding the $518-million charge for litigation expenses,
Genentech earned $101.5 million, or 23 cents a share, in line with
analysts' expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The biotechnology company, based in South San Francisco, reported
quarterly revenue of $652.3 million, up 26% from a year earlier.
Genentech said growth was driven by higher sales of its cancer drugs.</LD>
<TE>   Sales of Rituxan, its biggest drug, rose 46% to $274.9 million,
thanks to increased market penetration for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Genentech markets Rituxan with Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. of San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech said that as of June 30, it had $2.5 billion in cash and
investments, some of which could be used for acquisitions. Chief
Executive Art Levinson told analysts that as a result of the slide in
biotechnology stock prices, "some companies that were not attractive
to us before are beginning to appear so."</TE>
<TE>   Levinson added that Genentech does not need to do an acquisition
to meet its sales and earnings targets. He has previously said that
he is leery of large acquisitions because it is difficult to combine
operations and cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Levinson reiterated Wednesday that Genentech believes it honored
its contract with City of Hope. The company said it would not pay any
of the $500.2-million judgment against it until the appeals process
runs its course.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a jury ordered Genentech to pay $300.2 million in
compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages for
withholding royalties from City of Hope, a cancer center in Duarte.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech shares fell $1.65 to $25.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange, on a day when biotechnology stocks generally were down.</TE>

<HD>Global's Network Goes on the Block</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Fewer than 10 bids are expected in an auction that
could set the course for future deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knocked off the radar screen by the woes of bigger telecom rivals,
Global Crossing Ltd. puts its vaunted fiber-optic network on the line
today in an auction process that will help set the tone for what
buyers will pay for the glut of distressed properties in the ravaged
industry.</LD>
<LD>   A key bid will come in a joint offer from brothers Tom and Alec
Gores--the first time the two Los Angeles financiers will be
combining forces. They have separate investment firms that sometimes
vie against each other for failed businesses or units that larger
companies are selling.</LD>
<LD>   Sources at both firms said the value of their offer of cash, notes
and equity would be substantially higher than the initial bid by two
Asian companies that proposed $750 million in cash for 79% of Global
Crossing. In that deal, creditors would have received $300 million
and a 21% stake, a deal they rejected as inadequate.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't see any obstacles that will prevent us from making a
bid, but the final dotting of the I's and crossing the Ts is still
going on," one source said.</TE>
<TE>   Bidders, from the Gores' operations to telecommunications firms,
must submit offers for all or part of Global Crossing by noon. Global
and its bankers and creditors will then start evaluating ways to get
the most money out of the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 10 bids are expected, none from major carriers and only
a handful serious enough to act on, industry experts said. With
assets at other troubled telecoms such as WorldCom Inc. and Qwest
Communications International Inc. coming on the market, many
potential buyers are looking more for the customers they can gain
than for the fiber, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't call it a very enthusiastic crowd," said Alex Mou, an
analyst at Hotovec, Pomeranz &amp; Co. in San Francisco. "Clearly, no one
is putting in a lot of money for the bids. Additional dollars will be
needed to run the company, and investors already have been burned in
telecom deals."</TE>
<TE>   Even an offer of $1 billion in cash would mean less than 10 cents
on the dollar to bondholders and other creditors who are owed $12.4
billion. To entice them, analysts and investment bankers said, a
buyer is going to have to demonstrate that it can run the company and
make it financially viable.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the offers are, they will be the base for sales other
companies are planning.</TE>
<TE>   "Fair or unfair, it will be a reference point for similar
transactions in the future. That's the nature of this game," said
John Buck, a director at TenX Capital Partners in Conshohocken, Pa.,
which will decide this morning whether to bid on Global's
teleconferencing business or the entire business.</TE>
<TE>   Some investment bankers, however, believe that Global's operations
can't be compared to WorldCom's or Qwest's, and its assets would be
priced lower. Although Global has a cutting-edge network connecting
200 cities in 27 countries, it has only 85,000 commercial customers.
WorldCom has 20 million residential and commercial customers. And
customers are needed to fill the industry's fiber-optic lines that
are working at only 40% of capacity worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   That's one big reason no-shows at a Global Crossing sale may
include healthier telecoms such as AT&amp;T Corp. and Verizon
Communications Inc. AT&amp;T, though, could use Global's European network
to fill out its own lines there, and Verizon could get a big boost
into long-distance with Global's North America system.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gores' Platinum Equity operates NextiraOne, a
telecommunications company that designs, installs and manages telecom
systems for 400,000 customers. Offering bundled packages that include
long-distance lines would help to fill Global's cables.</TE>
<TE>   While the Gores brothers will be making an offer for the core
network, other companies such as TenX and ValueLogix Inc. in
Rochester, N.Y., may try to pick off smaller chunks of Global's
business that don't fit in with the network.</TE>
<TE>   ValueLogix also will be bidding for Global's teleconferencing
business, which coordinates large numbers of calls for meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Other potential bidders include Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim and a
related company, Telefonos de Mexico, as well as buyout firms such as
Texas Pacific Group and telecom firms from the large Infonet Services
Corp. in El Segundo to the small Fiber Optek Interconnect Corp. in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Global's chief executive, John Legere, has said the company has
attracted some attention from foreign firms.</TE>
<TE>   "There is at least one major Latin American player, and the other
is a European player with great assets in Latin America," Legere said
in an interview published this week in America Economia.</TE>
<TE>   Legere would not comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   IDT Corp., which last week publicly offered to buy several of
WorldCom's operations, had expressed interest in Global Crossing
early in the process. Executives at the New Jersey company did not
return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Global founder and Chairman Gary Winnick is trying to
line up investors to help revive the company.</TE>

<HD>Jones Apparel to Acquire Jeans Maker RSV Sport</HD>
<DH>Clothing: The buyer will pay $310 million and get the
popular l.e.i brand and a bigger share of the juniors market. No
layoffs are expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest sign that Southern California is a leader in the trendy
teen apparel market, Jones Apparel Group Inc. said Wednesday that it
would pay $310 million for Los Angeles-based RSV Sport Inc., parent
of the popular l.e.i. brand.</LD>
<LD>   RSV has made strong gains in the bulging juniors market with its
jeans for girls and young women. A recent survey of 2,000 teens
nationwide showed that more girls ages 12 to 19 bought l.e.i. jeans
in the last year than any other brand, according to Teenage Research
Unlimited, a market research firm in Northbrook, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   RSV, which launched in 1989 to make riding jeans for equestrians,
had sales of $248 million in 2001 and expects revenue to surpass $300
million this year.</LD>
<TE>   The manufacturer gained an edge competing with much larger
companies, including Gap Inc., Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Levi Strauss
&amp; Co., partly because it reacts nimbly to fashion shifts, said
Michael Wood, vice president of Teenage Research.</TE>
<TE>   It also heaped up revenue by selling both in teen specialty
stores, such as Wet Seal and Gadzooks, and in department stores,
where teens' parents often shop, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter if JCPenney or Kohl's is not the coolest store,
as long as they're carrying the brand kids want," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But whereas l.e.i was the "absolute leader" in the jeans market a
year ago, many companies are nipping at its heels, and the denim
market is saturated, said Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPD Fashion
World, a unit of NPD Group, a market information company in Port
Washington, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Jones Apparel, which designs and markets a wide
range of brands, including Jones New York, Lauren by Ralph Lauren and
Nine West, said the purchase would allow it to diversify its products
for juniors, the fastest-growing consumer demographic.</TE>
<TE>   It also will expand Jones sales in the moderate-price channel.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of RSV's business is girls' pants, mostly denim. The
company also licenses the l.e.i. name to companies that make other
products, including shoes, accessories and children's clothing.</TE>
<TE>   No layoffs are expected at RSV, which has 2,600 employees combined
at its downtown Los Angeles headquarters, a sales office in New York
and manufacturing plants in Mexico and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   RSV Chief Executive Mel Geliebter said the company's operations
would not change. Geliebter, who co-founded the company with his
wife, Susan, said joining Jones would give l.e.i an enormous
opportunity for growth.</TE>
<TE>   At Jones Apparel, which is known more for women's career apparel,
the juniors business accounts for only 5% of overall sales, said
Anita Britt, the company's executive vice president of finance. The
acquisition of RSV would boost that to 11%.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's a wide-open market for us because we don't have
much presence in it right now," she said."</TE>
<TE>   Adding l.e.i. to its stable also gives Jones Apparel a carrot to
wave at department stores, which have been trying to recapture teen
business lost to specialty stores in recent years, Cohen said. Most
of l.e.i. sales are in department stores.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives Jones a brand to say, 'We're in the forefront now of
that market,' " Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers are zeroing in on a "new jean generation," he said. Baby
boomers have long dominated the denim market, but shoppers ages 17 to
24 bought most of the jeans sold last year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   To acquire RSV, Jones would pay $272.5 million in cash, issue
about 1 million shares of common stock valued at $37.5 million and
assume about $75 million in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, selling shareholders and some employees of RSV would
be entitled to future payment of up to $70 million in cash or stock
if certain earnings targets are achieved over a three-year period,
Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones Apparel's stock closed at $34.75, down $1.10, on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Bush Spurs Debate Over Loans to Execs</HD>
<DH>Compensation: Firms are expected to take a tougher stance
on the corporate perk in the wake of the president's call for
reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ and LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's call to curb corporate loans to executives will
compel companies to take a much tougher stance toward extending the
perk, executive pay experts predicted Wednesday. But the analysts are
divided about whether the abuse of such loans goes much beyond the
scandals now plaguing corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   Executives' loans aren't the serious problem portrayed by the
president, some analysts contended, while others said they are.
Nonetheless, corporate boards will "probably try to avoid them
whenever they can," said Graef Crystal, a veteran
executive-compensation expert. "But there will still be some out
there."</LD>
<LD>   The loans are included in senior managers' compensation, often at
below-market interest rates. They're being made more often than they
were a decade ago, but they're not a routine element of corporate pay
packages, either, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   During the 1990s, about 412 members of the Fortune 1,000 largest
companies made loans to certain executives at various times during
the decade, up from 225 in the preceding decade, according to Judy
Fischer, managing director of Executive Compensation Advisory
Services, an Alexandria, Va., firm that tracks compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Such loans have come under assault because insiders at WorldCom
Inc., Enron Corp., Adelphia Communications Inc., Tyco International
Ltd. and other scandal-tainted firms received lavish corporate loans
even as the companies were suffering financial meltdowns, often amid
allegations of corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   That's how the issue became part of Bush's call Tuesday for
corporate reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Although the president's speech put an appropriately embarrassing
light on those cases, overall corporate loans to executives usually
are repaid without incident and often serve a useful purpose in
attracting talent, some experts said. For example, Westlake
Village-based Dole Food Co. last year made a $500,000 interest-free
loan to its new president, Lawrence Kern, to help him relocate to
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Loans also are made to help executives buy stock of their
companies, or to exercise stock options--a much more prevalent part
of executive compensation and one that's also under attack for
contributing to the wave of corporate scandals this year.</TE>
<TE>   Companies also make loans to help executives cover margin calls,
in which they have to put up more of their own money for company
stock that they previously bought with mostly borrowed cash.</TE>
<TE>   But such loans aren't the rule, said M. Evan Lindsay, a senior
partner at the executive-search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles
International, adding that he hasn't included a corporate loan in the
pay package given to any of the managers he's recruited in the last
three years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really an integral part of executive compensation in my
mind," Lindsay said.</TE>
<TE>   Executive-pay expert Crystal said, "I don't think this is a
pandemic problem in America. Most of these transactions just go right
along and they get paid back."</TE>
<TE>   But Scott Olsen, who heads the executive-compensation group for
management-consulting firm Towers Perrin, said companies shouldn't
make such loans because "I just never have seen a loan program that
didn't end badly."</TE>
<TE>   "You've either got people who are either badly in debt who can't
afford to be, or you end up with the fairly embarrassing situation of
[a company] having to forgive loans to people," Olsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Olsen agreed that the practice of making executive loans is
not as prevalent as the recent spate of scandals might suggest.
"There's a bunch of high-profile ones," he said. "And there are a
couple that are really ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Others expressed reservations about clamping down on the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always leery of proposals made from the hip," said Fischer of
Executive Compensation Advisory Services. "Many loans are made for
[executive] relocation and recruitment reasons, in order for the
executive to accept a job. Unfortunately, what always happens in life
is you have people who abuse these situations."</TE>
<TE>   Harry Gruber, chief executive of Kintera Inc., a closely held San
Diego company that assists nonprofit groups with Internet marketing,
said he makes loans to executives but only to recruit them to areas
where housing is expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'I'll give you this down payment, a forgiveness loan. If
you stay four years, it goes away completely.' So it's like a golden
handcuff for them to stay," Gruber said. "That's a very healthy
thing. A lot of organizations give them a signing bonus without any
handcuffs. But I think a loan in this case makes sense."</TE>
<TE>   But loans that can lead to scandal, or at least raise eyebrows
among investors, often are made by boards that feel pressured to help
top executives who have borrowed against their stock holdings and
then suddenly face margin calls. It's a particular problem when an
executive has inside information but can't immediately sell stock
because of insider-trading regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "The corporation feels held hostage by the executive," said
Gruber, who said executives should be barred from borrowing against
corporate stock holdings.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, the loans simply make for lousy public relations,
adding another layer to the perceived greed of corporate titans and
putting more pressure on corporate boards for better oversight.
Former Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay, for example, had a $7.5-million line
of credit from the company despite receiving tens of millions of
dollars in other compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's point is a good one," Crystal said of Bush. "With
most of these [loan] transactions, if you expose them to the cold
light of day, there's no reason to loan someone money. If they want a
loan, go to the bank."</TE>

<TE>   Forgive Me, Forgive Me Not</TE>
<TE>   A number of U.S. companies make loans to executives for many
reasons-and sometimes even forgive those loans. But with recent

some examples:</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq, S&amp;P Plummet to 5-Year Lows</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow closes below 9,000 as investor confidence
is shaken by fears of more corporate scandals and doubts about an
earnings rebound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue-chip stocks led another heavy sell-off on Wall Street on
Wednesday, driving key indexes to 1997 levels and the Dow Jones
industrial average below 9,000 for the first time this year.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the market's latest decline reflects a growing
investor disgust with mounting revelations of financial fraud, and
concerns that even accurately reported corporate earnings won't
rebound fast enough to make stocks attractive.</LD>
<LD>   "The emotion right now is one of despair, of paranoia that
everything is going wrong," said Subodh Kumar, investment strategist
at CIBC World Markets in New York.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 282.59 points, or 3.1%,
to 8,813.5, the lowest close since Sept. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The drop was even more pronounced in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index. It slumped 32.36 points, or 3.4%, to 920.47, falling to its
lowest since November 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite dropped 35.11 points, or 2.5%, to 1,346.01,
the lowest since May 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the plunge in the S&amp;P index was a result of Standard &amp;
Poor's announcement Tuesday that it will boot seven foreign-based
companies from the index July 19, replacing them with U.S. companies.
That triggered selling in the deleted stocks by investment funds that
seek to mimic the performance of the index.</TE>
<TE>   But investors were dumping more than just a handful of stocks
Wednesday. Losers swamped winners by 3 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq, in heavy trading.</TE>
<TE>   News that federal investigators have launched a criminal probe
into Qwest Communications Inc., and that a legal watchdog group had
sued Vice President Dick Cheney, alleging accounting fraud at the oil
services company he once led, deepened fears that the number of
corporate scandals will continue to grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly what we are seeing is a confidence issue," said Stuart
Freeman, chief equities strategist at brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons
in St. Louis. "The fundamentals are turning [positive], but investors
aren't buying it. Just like it takes a string of bad news to break
confidence, it takes a string of good news to bring it back the other
way."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Bush administration said the market's continuing
slide suggests investors have little confidence in the white-collar
fraud-fighting measures President Bush unveiled Tuesday morning. The
Dow fell 178.81 points Tuesday, with most of that occurring after
Bush's speech.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said many investors are reacting more to the economic
outlook, and questioning whether the expected rebound in corporate
earnings this year will be significant enough to make stock
valuations more appealing.</TE>
<TE>   The drug sector, for example, was hammered again Wednesday, in
part because of expectations that Congress will pass a bill that
could speed generic competition for many drugs. That could depress
earnings for some of the biggest companies in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Drug shares already were reeling after a government study Tuesday
linked one of Wyeth's key hormone-replacement drugs to health risks.
Wyeth shares fell $1.55 to $35.75 on Wednesday after diving $11.94 on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among other drug giants, Merck fell $2.18 to $43.57, Eli Lilly
dropped $1.80 to $48.18 and Pfizer slid $2.07 to $31.03.</TE>
<TE>   Electric utility stocks also were broadly lower Wednesday on
doubts about the industry's profit potential in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale cut her 2002 earnings
estimate for Duke Energy to $2.37 a share from $2.66 and downgraded
the stock to "hold" from "buy," according to Bloomberg News. The
stock slumped $3.06 to $26.</TE>
<TE>   Other utilities down sharply included TXU, off $4.99 to $42.77;
Southern California Edison parent Edison International, down $1.52 to
$13.49; and Public Service Enterprise, off $3 to $36.14.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones utility stock index fell 5.9% to 237.99, its lowest
since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Despite concerns about earnings, second-quarter profit reports of
blue-chip firms overall are expected to show a year-over-year
increase, according to earnings-tracker Thomson First Call. In fact,
fewer companies than normal have warned that results will miss
expectations, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   But that apparent good news isn't registering with many investors.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Wednesday, Treasury bond yields fell further as
investors fled stocks. The 10-year T-note yield dropped to a
seven-month low 4.61%, down from 4.73% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar, however, firmed against the euro despite stocks' woes.
The euro eased to 98.9 cents from 99.4 cents.</TE>
<TE>   European stock markets are facing their own deep sell-off: The
German market slid 4.1% Wednesday, and the British market dropped
2.7%.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * GM and Ford helped pull blue chips lower after Banc of America
Securities downgraded the stocks and cut 2003 earnings estimates on
concerns about higher costs for improved warranty programs. GM fell
$3.53 to $47.61 and Ford lost $1.12 to $13.99.</TE>
<TE>   * Viacom class A shares tumbled $4.71 to $36.10 on worries that
advertising spending might be weaker than expected.</TE>
<TE>   * Bank stocks fell across the board. Citigroup lost $1.02 to
$36.55 and PNC Financial was off $2.40 to $46.52.</TE>

<HD>US Home &amp; Garden, 2 Units Sued for Weed Trimmer Safety
Issues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal safety regulators said Wednesday they've sued the
manufacturer of a popular weed-trimming device, accusing the San
Francisco-based company of withholding evidence that the items were
dangerously flawed.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit filed on behalf of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission seeks fines against US Home &amp; Garden Inc. and two
subsidiaries for failing to notify the government about safety
problems with its Weed Wizard trimmer heads from 1987 to 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit says the company knew of at least 19 incidents in
which the metal chain links on the trimmer heads flew off and hit
people. In one case in 1997, the agency said, a 3-year-old girl was
killed when one of the links hit her skull.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for US Home &amp; Garden declined to comment on the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in February 1998, the agency said, US Home and its units
"had enough information to reasonably support the conclusion that the
Weed Wizard products were defective and could injure or kill
consumers, though the companies never contacted CPSC."</TE>
<TE>   US Home &amp; Garden acquired Weed Wizard in 1998. The trimmers were
recalled in May 2000.</TE>

<HD>Battered Drug Stocks Still Reeling From Study</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American and European investors showed their concerns Wednesday about
hormone replacement therapy, again fleeing stocks such as Wyeth Inc.,
Schering, Galen Holdings and other companies with HRT products on the
market.</LD>
<LD>   A clinical trial of the effects of hormone replacement therapy for
women after menopause was halted because of slightly increased risks
of dangerous side effects. The news, released Tuesday by the Journal
of the American Medical Assn., was another blow to a pharmaceutical
industry that is reeling from a series of regulatory setbacks and
mounting political pressure to control drug prices.</LD>
<LD>   But the big question now for drug companies is what women should
do in the wake of the most exhaustive study ever on hormone therapy
combining estrogen and progestin. The 5-year-old, 16,608-woman study
conducted by the National Institutes of Health found that healthy
women who take Wyeth's hormone replacement drug Prempro in the long
term faced a significant increase in risk for breast cancer, heart
disease, blood clots and strokes. The NIH is continuing a clinical
study of estrogen-only therapy.</LD>
<TE>   Hormone replacement therapy is used by an estimated 38% of
post-menopausal women to treat symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats, mood swings and vaginal dryness. The study, part of the
government-funded Women's Health Initiative, is viewed as a setback
to the prospect of using HRT as a disease prevention strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Financial analysts on both continents were making favorable
comments about the HRT industry, saying that Prempro, which is an
orally delivered combination of estrogen and progestin, is a dated
delivery system, and that the negative clinical trial does not
necessarily discredit hormone replacement therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Richard R. Stover, an analyst for Arnhold &amp; Bleichroeder, said
there are more modern synthetic hormones on the market and better
delivery systems, such as dermal patches that may not have the same
health risks.</TE>
<TE>   Added Bear Stearns analyst Joseph Riccardo, "I don't see this
affecting the industry as a whole. That was a study that suggested
one product with a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth's European competitors were quick to distance their estrogen
replacement therapies. Guenter Stock, head of research and
development for Germany-based Schering, said his company's products
are based on a different class of estrogens and progestins.</TE>
<TE>   A Wyeth spokesman said the company was not planning to change its
oral formulations or move to a dermal patch system.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Howard Judd, a principal investigator of the study and vice
chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA, said
he believed a transdermal patch delivery system for hormones could
negate the risks of stroke, blood clots and even heart attacks
because patches better mimic a woman's natural delivery of estrogen
through the bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   But Judd also delivered three major caveats that women should
consider before making a decision to try HRT patches.</TE>
<TE>   First, Judd acknowledged that his belief in the efficacy of
patches is a minority position among researchers and clinicians. He
also added that he suspected that there would be no diminution in the
risk for breast cancer, regardless of the hormone or the delivery
system used. Finally, he said the study had set a new standard for
long-term research and that nothing short of the same rigorous
standards would prove that other forms of HRT therapy were safer.</TE>
<TE>   The results of such studies would be years away, if they ever
occur, Judd said, leaving other companies to tout their estrogen
replacement therapies without evidence to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   The impact on Wyeth, which sold $2.2 billion in HRT products in
the 12 months ended March 31, could be severe, amounting to possible
sales losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But analysts
said the blow is survivable, pointing out that Wyeth has a store of
other products and promising new drugs in the approval pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth shares finished down 4.2%, off $1.55 to $35.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange, after a 24% plunge Tuesday. Galen, Northern
Ireland's largest drug maker, fell 7% in Irish trading. Schering was
down 7.2% in German trading.</TE>

<HD>Yahoo Moves Into Profit Territory</HD>
<DH>Internet: Results after six straight quarterly losses
validate moves by new chief Terry Semel, but some analysts see the
firm as overvalued.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reflecting a slow and steady shift amid the rubble of the dot-com
collapse, media giant Yahoo Inc. on Wednesday posted a slim profit
after six consecutive quarters of losses.</LD>
<LD>   The turnaround validates moves by Chief Executive Terry Semel, who
has struggled to reduce the Internet portal's reliance on advertising
and to implement fees for many of the site's most popular services.
Analysts said that Yahoo had navigated the worst of a disastrous
period and that the Internet economy appeared to be rebounding,
albeit slowly.</LD>
<LD>   Yahoo reported second-quarter net income of $21.4 million, or 3
cents a share, contrasted with a loss of $48.5 million, or 9 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period. The company said revenue rose to
$225.8 million from $182.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We turned a corner, and we are feeling really optimistic as we
look ahead," Semel told analysts during a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   But Semel, former co-CEO of Warner Bros., failed to comfort some
Wall Street watchers. Although analysts predict that the company
would turn a profit of 19 cents a share in 2003, Yahoo today is
trading at about 68 times next year's earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a company that's still struggling at its core, and the
valuation is completely irrational," said James R. Preissler,
director of Digital Media Research. "This is a company that has grown
its core business as far as it can and has put toes into a lot of
different pools. If Yahoo wants to succeed, it has to identify one
area and truly invest in it. There are growth options here. But what
are they?"</TE>
<TE>   After hemorrhaging dot-com advertisers that fueled its growth in
the late 1990s, Yahoo has cut costs recently by shutting Yahoo Radio
and the Finance Vision service, which made financial news television
shows broadcast over high-speed Internet connections.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Yahoo has instituted fees for many of its
services, such as its auction and online personals, and rebuilt its
ad- vertising base with both small businesses and old-school large
industries.</TE>
<TE>   One path of growth could be through its listings business unit, as
with the acquisition this year of Web employment firm HotJobs. The
deal helped boost Yahoo's paid premium services to $74.1 million, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Another big push will be in its marketing services, company
executives said. Even though Yahoo reported $135.7 million in
marketing services revenue--a 4% drop from the same time last
year--Semel insisted that business would boom in the coming quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason, Semel said, is the company's decision to get
into sponsored searches with Pasadena-based Overture Services.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, which gave Yahoo the bulk of its advertiser base of
70,000, provides pay-for-performance searches: Advertisers bid for
placement in the search listings, which usually appear as "sponsored
sites," and pay Overture--and in turn its partners, such as
Yahoo--when someone clicks on the links.</TE>
<TE>   It's a strategy that has been seen as necessary as search engines
have encountered tough times.</TE>
<TE>   Semel told analysts that he expected double-digit growth in
Yahoo's marketing services for the second half of 2002 compared with
the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo's news, which boosted tech stocks, helped bump its shares to
$12.85 in after-hours trading on Nasdaq. The stock had fallen 51
cents, to $12.19, during regular trading.</TE>

<HD>AMB Begins Expensing Stock Options</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Proponents say omitting such grants understates
a firm's compensation costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AMB Property Corp., the second-biggest U.S. warehouse owner, has
started accounting for the estimated market value of stock options
issued to employees and executives as an operating expense.</LD>
<LD>   AMB, a San Francisco-based real estate investment trust, is one of
the few large firms to take that step, which has been urged by many
shareholder activists who argue that companies are hiding the true
cost of options.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say omitting options from an income statement obscures a
transfer of wealth from shareholders to management and employees and
understates compensation costs. Each option granted to an employee
cuts the value of shares already held by investors.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. accounting rules require only an estimate of option costs to
be included in footnotes to earnings reports. Only two companies in
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index--Boeing Co. and Winn-Dixie Stores
Inc.--currently list options as an expense.</TE>
<TE>   "The current environment is forcing companies to be more
conservative in their accounting, but expensing stock options is
really going from one extreme to another," said David Zion, tax and
accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Other companies
"will be very slow to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Options issued after Jan. 1 are covered by the change, AMB said
Monday while releasing second-quarter results. Option costs will
reduce 2002 profit by 1 cent a share, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe in expensing stock options and have been fighting for
it for some time," said Patrick Connor, spokesman for TIAA-CREF, the
second-largest manager of retirement plans. "We think this issue may
now be going our way." Some members of Congress have proposed forcing
companies to expense options. Technology firms have fought the idea,
arguing that options are difficult to value.</TE>
<TE>   But a primary reason for the opposition is that expensing options
could significantly cut earnings for firms that have issued large
numbers of options. The technology industry has long used options as
a principal form of compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in profits among companies in the S&amp;P 500 would have
been steeper last year--21% instead of 18%--had options been
expensed, according to a study by brokerage Lehman Bros.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T, Comcast Holders OK Deal</HD>
<DH>Merger: Combined cable operations would boast more than 22
million customers. Dorman is likely to take the helm at the phone
company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp. and Comcast Corp. on Wednesday won shareholder approval
for the planned $27-billion merger of AT&amp;T Broadband with Comcast,
which would create the nation's No. 1 cable television operator, with
more than 22 million customers.</LD>
<LD>   That go-ahead came as AT&amp;T Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive C.
Michael Armstrong said that President David Dorman is the
front-runner to succeed him, and that a plan to issue tracking shares
for the consumer long-distance telephone unit may be scrapped.</LD>
<LD>   "It's fair to assume David Dorman would be the front-runner," said
Armstrong, who will leave AT&amp;T to become chairman of the combined
AT&amp;T Comcast when the sale of AT&amp;T's cable unit closes this year.</LD>
<TE>   Armstrong spoke at the annual meeting in Charleston, S.C. The
tracking stock was part of his October 2000 plan to stem a share
decline by breaking up AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   The approval of a 1-for-5 reverse stock split and the sale of AT&amp;T
Broadband to Comcast helped bring to an end Armstrong's vision of
creating a cable, telephone and Internet empire. Dorman, 48, would
take over a company that has forecast a mid-20% drop in consumer
long-distance sales this year.</TE>
<TE>   Telephone giant AT&amp;T in December agreed to sell its cable unit to
Comcast as part of a restructuring that dismantled its vision of
becoming a one-stop shop for telephone, data and video services.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of AT&amp;T Broadband to Comcast will leave AT&amp;T with
telephone and data operations serving about 50 million residential
customers and 4 million corporate customers. The combined company
would serve most of the top U.S. metropolitan markets.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia-based Comcast, which also owns the Flyers
professional hockey team and 76ers pro basketball team, would more
than double its cable TV subscriber base and add cable-based local
telephone services to its product mix.</TE>
<TE>   The deal must be approved by the Justice Department and the
Federal Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AT&amp;T shed 23 cents to close at $9.78 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Comcast's Class A shares lost 76 cents to $22.43 on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Avian Flu Will Cost Producers Millions</HD>
<DH>Food: Chickens and turkeys are destroyed to halt the
second-worst outbreak of the virus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cargill Inc., Pilgrim's Pride Corp. and three other poultry producers
will lose at least $108.4 million from the second-worst outbreak of
avian flu in U.S. history, an industry group said.</LD>
<LD>   About 4.74 million chickens and turkeys at 197 farms in Virginia's
Shenandoah Valley were slaughtered to halt the outbreak that began in
March, the National Turkey Federation said. Including $30 million in
losses from individual farmers, the loss from the virus totals at
least $138.4 million, it said. The other companies are Tyson Foods
Inc., Perdue Farms Inc. and George's Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Pittsburg, Texas-based Pilgrim's, the second-largest U.S. poultry
producer, said profit for the quarter ended June 29 would plunge to
between 2 cents and 5 cents a share, from the previous estimate of 27
cents to 32 cents. Greater-than-expected costs from the chicken flu
outbreak helped cause the drop in earnings, Chief Financial Officer
Richard Cogdill said.</LD>
<TE>   The company so far has destroyed 1.37 million turkeys, or 1.7% of
total annual production, and 826,000 chickens, which is less than 1%
of its annual production, said Kenneth Patrick, director of finance
for the company's Virginia operations.</TE>
<TE>   Avian influenza, which struck six counties in Virginia, is a
highly contagious virus that slows growth rates, limits egg-laying
capacity and reduces the value of turkeys and chickens. Birds must be
destroyed and farms must be quarantined to prevent the disease from
spreading.</TE>
<TE>   The disease isn't harmful to humans.</TE>
<TE>   Privately held Cargill, which raises about 50 million turkeys a
year worth $1 billion, has lost about 1.2 million turkeys and
breeding stock in the Virginia outbreak, said John O'Carroll,
president of the company's North American turkey operations in
Springdale, Ark. Losses probably will exceed $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson Foods, the world's largest poultry processor, lost about
50,000 broilers on two of its 493 Virginia chicken farms, spokesman
Ed Nicholson said.</TE>
<TE>   The outbreak is the second-worst in U.S. history. The most
destructive was in 1983-84, when more than 17 million chickens and
turkeys were destroyed.</TE>

<HD>Saturn Dealers Rated Tops in Customer Service Survey</HD>

<LD>General Motors Corp.'s Saturn led customer satisfaction in an annual
auto dealership study, marking the first time since 1986 that the top
ranking went to a non-luxury brand and ending a five-year run for
Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus.</LD>
<LD>   Lexus fell to third behind Saturn and Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti
brand in the latest survey by market researcher J.D. Power &amp;
Associates. General Motors' Cadillac division was fourth. Saturn
ranked second the last two years and is the first non-luxury winner
since Honda Motor Co.'s namesake brand.</LD>
<LD>   Saturn won the top ranking because of its performance on routine
maintenance such as oil changes. About 65% of Saturn service is
related to normal maintenance work, compared with a 55% industry
average, J.D. Power said.</LD>
<TE>   J.D. Power's reports are closely watched by auto makers and often
are cited in advertising. The latest study, based on responses from
about 50,000 new-vehicle owners, focuses on dealer-service
experiences in the first three months of ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Saturn "built a cult following" by stressing dealer service, said
Jim Gillette, vice president of consulting firm IRN Inc. The
division's sales, which fell 2.8% in this year's first half, have
"been in kind of the toilet the past couple of years" because it
lacked new models, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Saturn's first-half U.S. sales declined 2.8% to 145,740. Saturn is
starting to get new models such as the Vue sport utility vehicle and
that may help sales, Gillette said.</TE>
<TE>   Lexus attributed its decline in part to growth that has pushed
sales up 7.6% to a record 117,287 in this year's first six months.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sales have expanded so quickly and we only have 197 dealers,"
Lexus spokeswoman Nancy Hubbell said. "We may not have had as many
sales outlets and service people as we need."</TE>
<TE>   Nissan's Infiniti is upgrading dealer showrooms and service
facilities, which should help in future surveys, said Mark McNabb,
the brand's vice president. "It's nice to see this move up to second
in the 2001 study."</TE>

<HD>Report Faults Meat Inspection System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. meat plants that failed government food safety guidelines still
sold hamburgers and chicken to consumers, despite assurances from the
Bush administration that the plants would be shut, according to a
draft report by congressional investigators.</LD>
<LD>   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
found significant holes in how the Department of Agriculture
supervised and enforced regulations at meat-processing plants,
according to the draft report, which has not been made public.</LD>
<LD>   A copy of the 18-page report was obtained Wednesday from the
Consumer Federation of America.</LD>
<TE>   Government data have linked contaminated food to more than 76
million U.S. illnesses and 5,000 deaths annually.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA in April reported a rise in salmonella in chicken and
turkey from 2000 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   USDA inspectors discovered dozens of plants with high levels of
salmonella and fecal contamination last year, but the companies were
allowed to continue to conduct business, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA said that many of the report's findings were known and
that officials were working to correct the problems.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO reviewed 68 USDA enforcement cases from last year. From
these cases, USDA inspectors informed 60 plants that they would have
to stop meat production because of food safety violations.</TE>
<TE>   However, in 95% of the cases, the USDA did not follow through with
its threat.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA also randomly tests meat products for the deadly bacteria
salmonella, which kills 600 Americans annually.</TE>
<TE>   For plants that failed two sets of salmonella testing, the USDA
took an average of three months to begin reviewing whether the plants
had corrected the problem.</TE>
<TE>   It took an additional three months for the inspectors to contact
the companies about their assessments, according to the report.</TE>

<HD>Public Broadcasters Pick Up Static on Capitol Hill</HD>
<DH>Media: Officials fail to avoid a partisan debate over their
programming as they seek funding for digital technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Public broadcasters asked Capitol Hill for half a billion dollars
Wednesday to help it meet a government-mandated transition to digital
technology.</LD>
<LD>   But rather than commitments of financial support, organizations
such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and National Public
Radio got an earful from Republican lawmakers about the perceived
liberal bias of their programming.</LD>
<LD>   Relations between public broadcasters and the
Republican-controlled House have been rocky since the late 1990s,
when it was revealed that some public broadcasting stations had
shared their subscriber lists with the Democratic National Committee
for fund-raising purposes.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. W. J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, which oversees the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, shelved efforts to reauthorize government funding for
public broadcasters. That funding, which accounts for 12% of the
CPB's revenue, is set to expire in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   For five years public broadcasters have unsuccessfully sought
funds to help them build new facilities and buy equipment to
broadcast digital television and radio signals by the
government-imposed deadline of May 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm conflicted," Tauzin said Wednesday during a hearing intended
to address digital conversion, but that turned into a familiar debate
about programming on publicly supported TV and radio. "American
taxpayers feel that public television is not fair."</TE>
<TE>   A point of contention was a January report on NPR suggesting that
the Traditional Values Coalition, a Christian advocacy group in
Orange County, had a motive in the lethal anthrax attacks on U.S.
Sens. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt). The coalition
recently had criticized both senators for removing the phrase "so
help me God" from the oath in their committee hearings.</TE>
<TE>   NPR later aired a retraction, calling the story "inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   But at the hearing Wednesday, the coalition's executive director,
Andrea Lafferty, squared off against NPR President and Chief
Executive Kevin Klose, calling NPR "anti-Christian."</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from several Republican lawmakers, Klose formally
apologized for the story. But Lafferty still asked the committee to
punish NPR by revoking its federal funding, which accounts for about
2% of NPR's revenue, according to Klose.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats rushed to the defense of public broadcasters, citing
their contributions to quality, top-rated children's programming and
news coverage, including after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) dismissed complaints about liberal
bias as "ranting and raving" by Republicans seeking to intimidate
broadcasters into providing more conservative coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The partisan debate was a setback for public broadcasting
officials, who had hoped they would be able to move beyond the
controversy over their programming and talk about their funding
needs.</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Public Television Stations estimates it will cost
$1.7 billion to convert the nation's 356 public broadcasting stations
to digital. So far, only about 76 stations have made the transition.</TE>
<TE>   The government is pressing public and commercial broadcasters to
convert to digital signals, which provide clearer sound and pictures,
increased channel capacity for programming and interactive features.
The government also is eager to move broadcasters off existing analog
channels so they can auction off the spectrum for other purposes.</TE>

<HD>Pressplay Loses CEO to Radio Post</HD>
<DH>Music: Andy Schuon moves from the online service to
programming position at Infinity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pressplay, the fledgling online music service owned by Sony Music
Entertainment and Universal Music Group, is losing its first chief
executive after 13 months on the job.</LD>
<LD>   Infinity Radio, a division of Viacom International, on Wednesday
named Andy Schuon, Pressplay's president and chief executive, as its
president of programming. The move reunites Schuon with friend and
former colleague John Sykes, the recently appointed chief executive
of Infinity Broadcasting who worked with Schuon in the mid-1990s at
Viacom's VH1.</LD>
<LD>   Schuon departs at a crucial time for Pressplay, which launched its
online music subscription services in December.</LD>
<TE>   The company is working on a major upgrade aimed at making the
service more competitive with the many unauthorized free sources of
music online. It also has been embroiled in a lengthy antitrust
investigation by the Department of Justice, which is examining the
major record labels' on- line activities for evidence of anti-
competitive behavior.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important battles Schuon fought at Pressplay was
to try to persuade the major record labels to let subscribers
accumulate and make permanent copies of the music they download. He
was only partly successful, winning limited rights for subscribers to
burn songs onto CD.</TE>
<TE>   "His departure is unfortunate," said analyst P.J. McNealy of
research firm GartnerG2, "because he has a real sense for what
consumers want, especially with regards to portability of music. And
he wasn't able to fully execute that vision to date."</TE>
<TE>   To replace Schuon, Pressplay promoted its chief operating officer,
Michael Bebel, a former Internet strategist for Universal Music Group
who helped formulate the joint venture.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike is an extremely talented executive with exactly the right
blend of experience in music, technology and operations to lead
Pressplay forward and ensure a seamless transition," Sony and
Universal said in a joint statement. The record companies are,
respectively, units of Sony Corp. and Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Schuon's experience was in programming. And although his
work at Pressplay was unfinished, Schuon said, he wanted to return to
his programming roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my first dollar in radio, and my life's work has been in
programming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Infinity is one of the country's largest radio groups, with 183
stations concentrated in major metropolitan areas. But it hasn't put
any of its radio feeds online, mainly because it is unconvinced it
can profit by broadcasting on the Internet.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Launches Criminal Investigation of Qwest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc., already under investigation
for its accounting practices, said Wednesday that federal prosecutors
have launched a criminal probe, sending shares diving as investors
worry the nation's fourth-largest local phone company may be headed
for bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office confirmed the
investigation but declined to provide details. The dominant local
phone company in 14 states from Minnesota to Washington, Qwest said
it is cooperating fully.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest, with 57,000 employees and 17.6 million customers, declined
to discuss the prospects for a bankruptcy. The Denver-based company
has reported eight straight quarterly losses, totaling $5.2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Qwest has been under pressure for months as it struggles to cope
with a cash crunch and $26 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Credit rating agencies have slashed the company's debt to "junk,"
and the Securities and Exchange Commission is probing its accounting.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the SEC began investigating the phone company's swaps of
long-distance network capacity with rivals such as Global Crossing
Ltd., also the target of a criminal probe. The swaps may have
inflated revenue.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. attorneys typically open investigations after referrals from
agencies such as the FBI or the Internal Revenue Service, or at their
own initiative, said Martin Pollner, an attorney who has defended
companies accused of wrongdoing by federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Richard Notebaert, who replaced Joseph Nacchio
last month, is trying to sell assets to help pay down debt and avoid
a loan default.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings responded Wednesday by
cutting Qwest's senior unsecured debt ratings and warned they could
be downgraded again. They said the probe may hurt the company's
ability to attract and retain customers, as well as its efforts to
quickly sell several assets.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest's shares fell as low as $1.52 on the New York Stock
Exchange, before finishing down 83 cents, or 32%, at $1.77.</TE>

<HD>UPS Labor Deadline Looms</HD>
<DH>Shipping: Package volume falls 4% in June as some customers
begin using other carriers. Negotiations continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a July 31 deadline approaches, negotiators for the Teamsters union
and United Parcel Service Inc. remain far apart on economic issues,
causing some nervous customers to start using other carriers.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta-based UPS disclosed Wednesday that package volume in June
was down about 4% from the previous year, and blamed at least half
the drop on diversions to other shippers. UPS spokesman Norman Black
also cited the softer economy.</LD>
<LD>   "Customers are getting anxious," Black said. "They had hoped we
would have settled this by now."</LD>
<TE>   The current five-year contract expires at the end of the month,
and union employees voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if
negotiators reach an impasse. A 15-day strike in 1997 crippled U.S.
commerce and at least temporarily boosted the clout of organized
labor. At this point, however, both sides say they hope to avoid a
disruption of service. The contract covers about 210,000 employees,
by far the largest single group of workers represented by the
1.4-million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators are meeting daily in Washington on a master agreement,
and have settled the majority of 32 supplemental agreements that
tailor work rules to specific regions, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters spokesman Bret Caldwell said talks have bogged down on
major economic questions, including health care and pension costs.
With health-care costs soaring and the stock market crashing, UPS has
sought to pass along some expenses to employees. Caldwell said there
is a "wide gap" between UPS and the union on benefits. The union also
wants wage increases and thousands of part-time jobs converted to
full-time.</TE>
<TE>   UPS shares rose $2.51 to close at $63.25 on the Big Board.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T Wireless, VoiceStream in Preliminary Talks to Join
Forces</HD>
<DH>Deal: The union would create the second-largest mobile
carrier and could start a spree of mergers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first sign of consolidation in the once highflying wireless
industry, VoiceStream Wireless is in exploratory merger talks with
rival AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc., industry sources said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T, the nation's No. 3 carrier, and VoiceStream, which ranks
sixth, are discussing a deal valued at $10 billion that would create
the nation's second-largest mobile phone company, a source
knowledgeable about the talks said.</LD>
<LD>   But the negotiations, which are described as preliminary, face
significant financial and regulatory hurdles. They also might be
complicated by VoiceStream's plans to undertake a multibillion-dollar
upgrade of its wireless network as well as launch a costly new
advertising campaign featuring actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.</LD>
<TE>   "This deal wouldn't be totally surprising--but it's no slam dunk
either," said Adam Zawel, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a
wireless consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Redmond, Wash.-based AT&amp;T Wireless declined to
comment. Bellevue, Wash.-based VoiceStream officials did not return
calls, although a key company lawyer said he has not been informed of
any talks.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies--along with the nation's four other major
wireless carriers--face increasing pressure to scale back their
expansion plans and consolidate amid vicious industry price wars that
have slashed revenue per minute of mobile telephone use to 14 cents,
from 53 cents in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the head of Deutsche Telekom, which owns VoiceStream,
is desperately seeking a blockbuster deal that would quiet calls for
his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Sommer, chairman and chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, has
been under fire for plunging his company into more than $60 billion
in debt thanks to the $31-billion acquisition of VoiceStream and
paying nearly $8 billion for new wireless phone spectrum during
airwave auctions in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But any deal between VoiceStream and AT&amp;T likely would benefit
AT&amp;T more than Deutsche. That's because VoiceStream already has in
place the kind of wireless network AT&amp;T is seeking to build: global
systems for mobile communications, or GSM.</TE>
<TE>   GSM has become the standard in Europe and much of Asia, and AT&amp;T
had planned to spend billions to adopt GSM in order to provide
expanded coverage and roll out new second-generation wireless
services such as high-speed Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   A merger with VoiceStream might make much of the spending
unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have been looking for signs of consolidation in the face
of a bloody industry price war, slowing consumer demand for mobile
phones and costly upgrades to introduce high-speed Internet access
and other enhanced services.</TE>
<TE>   But a source close to AT&amp;T said discussions haven't progressed
very far.</TE>
<TE>   "This deal, if it happens, is going to happen real quickly because
of" regulatory issues and other complicating factors, said Michael
King, a senior analyst at Gartner Dataquest, a Stamford, Conn.-based
research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Among the stumbling blocks will be who will own the merged
company. VoiceStream has been pushing for a deal that would make it
the dominant shareholder in AT&amp;T Wireless. But AT&amp;T Wireless,
according to a source close to the company, has resisted such a move
and is insisting on absolute control of any merged entity.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a transaction is not completed, the talks between AT&amp;T
Wireless and VoiceStream may inspire carriers such as Cingular or
Sprint to seek merger partners.</TE>
<TE>   When asked Wednesday about merger talks involving Cingular, SBC
Communications Inc. President William Daley said, "We look at all
sorts of possibilities out there, but there's nothing that we plan to
announce about any deal or any discussions we're having." SBC owns
nearly 60% of Cingular.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless shares rose 30 cents to $5.45 and Bonn-based
Deutsche Telekom's U.S.-listed shares fell 14 cents to $10.96, both
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Rising Tally of Weakest Junk</HD>
<DH>Investments: Explosion in lowest-rated issues reflects
troubles of debt-laden companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The junk bond market is getting junkier, which may be a reason many
investors are shunning those securities, a new report suggests.</LD>
<LD>   A record $172 billion of U.S. corporate junk bonds, or 27% of the
total, had ratings of Caa or lower at the end of June, according to
credit-rating firm Moody's Investors Service.</LD>
<LD>   A Caa rating is the seventh-lowest junk rating and indicates
substantial risk of default. All junk bonds are considered to be
below investment grade in quality.</LD>
<TE>   In 1998, by comparison, $30 billion of junk bonds, or 8% of the
total, had the lowest ratings, Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion in the tally of lowest-rated junk issues reflects
the collapse of the telecommunications sector and the troubles of
many other debt-laden companies since the economy began to slow in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Caa-rated junk universe has grown at a 47% annualized rate
since 1998, Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, junk bonds in general have suffered a sharp
sell-off as investors have pulled away from the market, despite
yields of 10% or higher on many securities.</TE>
<TE>   The rash of corporate accounting scandals has spooked investors
and raised concerns about a new surge in corporate failures if the
true financial condition of many companies has been obscured.</TE>
<TE>   But Moody's and rival ratings firm Standard &amp; Poor's expect junk
bond default rates to fall rather than rise, reflecting an improving
economy. The U.S. junk default rate slipped in June to 9.62% of
outstanding bonds from 9.72% in May, S&amp;P said. That is a 12-month
annualized rate.</TE>
<TE>   As for the surge in the lowest-rated tier of junk bonds, "the hope
is that most companies that are susceptible to such a rapid slide in
credit quality have already been exposed," said John Puchalla,
economist at Moody's in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "That being said, there's a lot of uncertainty out there with
respect to just how many more accounting restatements might arise,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Energy Firms Ordered to Repay Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An oil and gas investment operation that claimed it would benefit
from rising energy prices after Sept. 11 has been ordered to repay
$1.3 million to 65 investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a settlement filed Monday in federal court in Los Angeles,
Texon Energy Corp. and Lonestar Petroleum Corp. did not admit or deny
guilt. The SEC said it is unclear whether the companies, which are in
receivership, have enough assets to repay the investors fully. If
there are extra funds after the liquidation, they agreed to pay fines
of up to $1.25 million.</LD>
<LD>   The firms, incorporated in Nevada under the control of Barry V.
Reed of Las Vegas, were run from Inglewood, the SEC said. Reed's
alleged accomplice, former stockbroker James E. Hammonds of
Inglewood, was barred from the securities industry in 1996 for his
prior role in an oil and gas scheme, said Lisa A. Gok, the SEC's
assistant regional director in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC said civil fraud charges are pending against Reed and
Hammonds, who are acting as their own attorneys and couldn't be
reached for comment. Their former lawyer, Allan McPhee of Torrance,
said they were trying to operate a legitimate business and any
violations were unwitting.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said only about 25% of the funds collected from elderly
investors nationwide were used to purchase oil and gas interests.
Reed and Hammonds claimed that Texon was a safe and profitable
investment paying a 12% annual dividend, the SEC said. But the
company paid its "dividends" with money raised from other investors,
the SEC said.</TE>

<LD>* Adding insult to injury for investors fleeing the stock market, the
average seven-day yield on taxable money market mutual funds fell to
a record low this week of 1.30%, down from 1.33% a week ago,
according to IMoneyNet Inc. in Westborough, Mass. Many economists
said the Federal Reserve probably won't raise short-term interest
rates before the fourth quarter. That could keep money fund yields
depressed at least until year's end</LD>
<LD>   * More than 103,000 WorldCom workers lost nearly $1.1 billion in
company stock they held in their retirement accounts since the end of
1999, the AFL-CIO said. Because the stock is so widely held, its
collapse in the wake of a $3.9-billion accounting scandal already has
hit some state pension funds. Although WorldCom did not require
workers to accept matching company contributions to their 401(k)
pension accounts in the form of company stock as Enron did, the
AFL-CIO said many of them were influenced by WorldCom's culture to
bet most of their retirement accounts on the stock.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SunTrust Banks Inc., the first of the 10 largest U.S. banks to report
second-quarter earnings, said profit fell 1% after it set aside more
money for loans that won't be paid back.</LD>
<LD>   Net income totaled $343.7 million, or $1.20 a share, down from
$347.1 million, or $1.19, in the same period last year. Higher
investment banking fees and a rise in deposits helped offset $111
million the Atlanta-based bank reserved for loan losses, almost
triple the amount in the same quarter last year.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Phil Humann said a sluggish economy would prompt
more loan losses. SunTrust wrote off $16.3 million to units of Enron
Corp. in the second quarter and is owed $76 million by Adelphia
Communications Corp., bank officials said.</LD>

colleagues, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of withholding

Cos. to protect retirement benefits for more than 9,500 workers at

<LD>   * A Bank of America Corp. subsidiary lost a bid to avoid $50
million in back taxes when a Tax Court judge ruled it can't claim a
tax break for two savings and loan units it acquired in the 1980s.
The federal judge ruled that Bank of America's Barnett Banks Inc. is
not entitled to use the reserve method of accounting for bad debts
because the Florida thrifts it purchased had obtained bank charters
in order to be acquired.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc. received a conditional $900-million loan
guarantee that the carrier said it needs to raise $1 billion in new
financing and avoid a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   The application was approved on conditions that include the
seventh-largest U.S. carrier giving the government a bigger potential
stake in the company and completing concession agreements with
workers and creditors, the Air Transportation Stabilization board
said.</LD>
<LD>   The carrier has been trying to shave $1.3 billion from its annual
expenses to survive amid a slump in travel that started early last
year and worsened after the Sept. 11 attacks. The board was created
to review applications for up to $10 billion in guarantees.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Arlington, Va.-based US Airways rose 11 cents to $3.63

<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Attorney General's office has decided not to take any
immediate action against the nation's top sellers of French fries for
selling products that contain acrylamide, a chemical the state
considers toxic.</LD>
<LD>   Two environmental coalitions had sought to use California's
Proposition 65 to force McDonald's Corp., Burger King and other food
companies to slap warning labels for acrylamide on their packages or
reformulate their products.</LD>
<LD>   A number of government studies in recent months found high levels
of the suspected human carcinogen in starchy foods cooked at high
temperatures.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter Tuesday to Raphael Metzger, an attorney representing
one of the groups, Deputy Atty. Gen. Ed Weil said he has no immediate
plans to file suit against the burger chains. He did not rule out
taking the matter up at a later date, when more information on the
health effects of acrylamide in food is available.</TE>

in Manhattan, department spokesman Bryan Sierra said.</LD>
<LD>   A statement released by Lampton's office said he and several
members of his staff have been recused from the Justice Department's
review of WoldCom matters, but some members of that office will be
allowed to work on the investigation which is to be "coordinated" by
the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.</LD>

<HD>KPMG Says SEC Wrong About Xerox Correction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KPMG Chairman and Chief Executive Eugene O'Kelly, on the job less
than three months, said the Securities and Exchange Commission was
wrong to force former audit client Xerox Corp. to restate five years
of sales.</LD>
<LD>   KPMG's argument that an SEC interpretation of accounting rules is
incorrect marks a rare public clash between a Big Five accountant and
its chief regulator, especially since KPMG's audit work is being
investigated by the SEC, accountants said.</LD>
<LD>   Xerox's restatements of $6.4 billion in revenue between 1997 and
2001, required under a settlement the copier maker reached with the
SEC, "defy economic reality" and don't change KPMG's view that its
accounting for Xerox was correct, KPMG has said.</LD>
<TE>   The refusal by KPMG to admit errors at Xerox reflects the
complexity of lease-accounting rules, which are open to different
interpretations, and a desire to avoid liability claims from Xerox
shareholders whose stock fell from $62 in 1999 to $6 in November last
year, lawyers and accountants said.</TE>

<LD>Angelle Savoie is a petite 5-foot, 105-pound former model from
Louisiana who is not pleased with the way the macho world of pro
motorcycle drag racing looks upon her as its champion.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish [some of] these guys would just accept me," she said. "I
don't know if it's because I'm a girl. That's how they refer to me,
as 'that girl,' they don't even use my name.</LD>
<LD>   "Except for a couple of guys, I feel like everybody hates me. They
don't say it, but I can see it in their eyes."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Courtesy of the Washington Times, what do Kobe
Bryant, Karl Malone, Franco Harris, Manny Ramirez, Fred Dryer, Paul
Christman and Mitch Kupchak have in common?</TE>
<TE>   Look-alike: Shortstop John McCurdy, the Oakland Athletics'
first-round draft choice, is often told how much he looks like a
young Cal Ripken Jr. Oakland Assistant General Manager Paul
DePodesta's reaction: "I hope he plays 2,000 games in the big
leagues."</TE>
<TE>   Bad makes good: Chicago Sun-Times columnist Rick Telander applauds
the Bulls' selection of Jay Williams in the NBA draft, but questions
how the team was able to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "It never ceases to amaze me that in a controlled franchise system
such as the NBA, blowing up your team and foisting garbage on your
fans for several seasons can be the ticket to success. Utter
lousiness is how the Bulls got here."</TE>
<TE>   Hard losers: Brits don't take their losses easily, as evidenced by
a headline in the Daily Telegraph: "It's Always Game, Set and Match
to the Other Chap."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Foster wrote, "Another valiant effort, another Tim Henman
semifinal loss and yet another wretched chapter in the multi-volume
history of near-misses that is English sport."</TE>
<TE>   As Art Spander pointed out in the Oakland Tribune, it has been a
bad year for English sport. Besides Henman's loss at Wimbledon,
England lost to Brazil in the World Cup quarterfinals, to Scotland in
rugby and to Zimbabwe in cricket.</TE>
<TE>   Want to try it? The recent Fourth of July holiday showcased a
rodeo in St. Paul, Ore., 30 miles south-southwest of Portland.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Ken Wheeler of the Oregonian, bull rider Vic
Dubray explained what motivates him: "Just a challenge, something
that not everybody can do, gettin' on an animal that outweighs you by
a ton."</TE>
<TE>   Back at you: Rowdy fans aren't the only hecklers on golf courses.
Sometimes it's the players too.</TE>
<TE>   During last year's Western Open, Raymond Floyd had finished his
round and was watching Peter Jacobsen coming up 18.</TE>
<TE>   "You're hitting the wrong ball," Floyd yelled at Jacobsen. "You're
hitting the wrong ball."</TE>
<TE>   It was Jacobsen's ball.</TE>
<TE>   "What time did you start on the margaritas?" Jacobsen shot back.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: All were No. 13th draft choices.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: During the men's final at Wimbledon in which
Australian Lleyton Hewitt trounced Argentine David Nalbandian, a
streaker ran across Centre Court.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important only to know than Nalbandian wasn't the only one
undressed at Centre Court," commented Gary Shelton of the St.
Petersburg Times. "The streaker, who leaped the net in his effort,
seemed to be a much finer athlete."</TE>

<TE>   Brooklyn Dodger outfielder Cal Abrams was thrown out at home plate
in the ninth inning of a game that would have forced a playoff for
the 1950 National League pennant.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Abrams, who played for five major league teams from 1949-56,
can thank Gene Fehler for a chance to explain that infamous play.
Fehler, a poetry teacher from South Carolina who wrote "Tales from
Baseball's Golden Age" in 2000, returns with "More Tales from
Baseball's Golden Age." The 241-page hardcover book is a collection
of intriguing and wacky plays of the 1940s and '50s.</TE>
<TE>   Abrams, describing the play that led to the Philadelphia Phillies
winning the 1950 NL pennant, says, "Milton Stock, the [Dodger]
third-base coach, was waving his arms and yelling, 'Go, go, go.' Then
at the last moment ... he had his hand up to his mouth and his other
arm up and I thought, 'What kind of a sign is that?' "</TE>
<TE>   Scattered throughout the books are anecdotes and recollections
from a time before airplane travel.</TE>
<TE>   Some 50 Hall of Famers are interviewed in Fehler's new book, with
nearly two dozen players included who were not in his first.</TE>

<TE>   Prosecutors in Philadelphia won't decide until today whether to
charge Allen Iverson of the 76ers with storming into a home with a
gun and threatening two men.</TE>
<TE>   Police presented their case to the district attorney's office in a
meeting that lasted nearly three hours.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said they weren't ready to make a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Michael Chitwood, who met with prosecutors, called the delay
"standard procedure."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson has not commented publicly on the allegations. He was
outside his house Wednesday night but didn't respond to reporters who
shouted questions at him from the other side of a fence.</TE>
<TE>   Duke guard Jay Williams, the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft, signed a

<TE>   Domestic violence charges against Al Unser Jr. could stall because
his girlfriend downplayed events in later interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Little physical evidence and a victim reluctant to push the case
forward could bring the case to a halt, according to Scott Minier of
the Marion County Sheriff's Department in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Jena L. Soto, 38, initially told police Unser hit her in the face
and left her on the side of a highway in the middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   But in a taped statement with police late Tuesday, Soto downplayed
the events, police said. Detectives said they would rely on
prosecutors to decide if the case should move forward.</TE>

<HD>Study Cites Growing Ranks of AIDS Orphans</HD>
<DH>Health: A report finds 13.4 million children have lost at
least one parent. Researchers also offer estimates of the cost of
patient care in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>The number of children worldwide who have lost at least one parent to
AIDS has skyrocketed from 1 million in 1991 to 13.4 million this
year, and the total will double by 2010, according to an
international report issued here Wednesday at the 14th International
AIDS Conference.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of the most shocking reports released at this
conference," said Dr. Peter Piot of UNAIDS, an alliance of six United
Nations agencies fighting HIV and AIDS. "The very fabric of society
is disappearing with family structures that are crumbling."</LD>
<LD>   To put the numbers in perspective, officials said that the 13
million already "orphaned"--defined as having lost at least one
parent to AIDS--is equivalent to the total number of children in the
United States younger than 5.</LD>
<TE>   The report noted that there are 34 million orphans in Africa,
about one-third of them as a result of AIDS. By 2010, there will be
40 million orphans, half of them as a result of AIDS, said one of the
report's authors, Karen Stanecki of the U.S. Census Bureau. The AIDS
orphans will account for 6% of the continent's children.</TE>
<TE>   The report also said there are now 65 million orphans in Asia, 2
million of them as a result of AIDS. That number is expected to grow
to 5 million by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   The report surveyed only those 15 or younger who had lost at least
one parent to the disease. Poverty and other problems are so severe
in the region that losing even one parent severely impacts a child's
ability to survive, become educated, and make a life. Such children
are at very high risk of physical and sexual exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also said that the numbers would continue to grow even
in the highly unlikely event that HIV transmission suddenly ceased,
because it will take many years for those now infected by the virus
to develop AIDS and die.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if today by some miracle the number of AIDS transmissions
would stop, the number of orphans would continue to rise," Piot said.
"This is unprecedented except in times of war."</TE>
<TE>   In other news at the conference, researchers provided the first
estimates of the cost of AIDS care in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost for an HIV-positive patient is $14,000 a year,
while care for those with AIDS averages $34,000 a year, Dr. Michael
Saag of the University of Alabama at Birmingham told the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew it cost more to care for the sicker patients," said Saag,
who led the first comprehensive analysis of such costs. "This
analysis shows how much more."</TE>
<TE>   Saag reached his conclusions by studying 700 patients at
university clinics over a two-year period. But he used average
wholesale prices for the drugs, so the figures may be conservative
for many patients, he cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of the stage of the disease, the majority of the cost
is in the medications," Saag said.</TE>
<TE>   For people who are HIV-positive but showing no symptoms, those
drugs cost about $11,000 a year. But as the illness progresses, the
price of drugs to treat pneumonia, tuberculosis and certain cancers
boosts the cost to about $24,000, Saag said.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the cost is primarily for hospitalizations. Clinic
costs--the price of seeing a physician or nurse practitioner
regularly--account for less than 2% of the average cost of care for
all patients, averaging about $340 a year.</TE>
<TE>   To deal with the high cost of AIDS care, a group of 15 Caribbean
nations signed an agreement to get heavily discounted AIDS drugs from
the manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The new agreement will bring AIDS drugs to about 75,000 of the
estimated 420,000 people in the region living with HIV or AIDS. That
infection rate accounts for 2.3% of the region's population, a
prevalence second only to sub-Saharan Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement was announced Wednesday by Denzil Douglas, the prime
minister of St. Kitts and Nevis. The six companies signing the
agreement were GlaxoSmithKline, Roche Holding, Boehringer Ingelheim,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Merck &amp; Co. and Abbott Laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of the discounts will vary, depending on a country's
wealth. Some of the poorest countries will receive a 90% discount,
equivalent to that given to some African countries.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, "there are some countries that will still not be able to
afford these prices--Haiti, Jamaica, Guyana, just to name a few,"
Douglas said.</TE>
<TE>   In other events, activists who had disrupted a Tuesday speech by
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson continued
their controversial outbursts Wednesday afternoon, vandalizing two
different booths at the exposition accompanying the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, they vandalized a booth operated by the
European Commission, spray-painting "Shame" on the walls and
plastering the booth with stickers asking, "Where is the $10
billion?"--a reference to the annual sum that UNAIDS says will be
necessary to implement effective treatment and prevention efforts.</TE>
<TE>   So far, wealthy nations have contributed less that $3 billion to
this year's proposed budget.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters afterward, Octavi Quintana, director of
health research at the European Commission, said, "I think the action
was misguided."</TE>
<TE>   "The commission is responsible for a program of [nearly $900
million] a year as a response against AIDS," he added. "You may say
it's a lot or not enough--probably it's not enough--but I think it
represents an important effort when you compare with what others are
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Spanish activists shut down a booth operated by the health
ministry of the Spanish region of Catalonia, protesting the agency's
decision not to offer a needle-exchange program in the region's
prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Security guards allowed the noisy but peaceful demonstrations to
proceed, and both booths were reopened by the end of the day.</TE>

<HD>Women Form an Increasing Segment of Those With HIV</HD>
<DH>Disease: In Africa, rapes and men's refusal to wear condoms
make prevention difficult.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>About half of all new HIV infections occur in women, experts say, and
females account for nearly two-thirds of new cases among people in
their late teens and early 20s.</LD>
<LD>   Sex between men and women continues to be the main transmission
route for HIV in the developing world, and it is difficult for women
there to follow prevention recommendations because of their
subordinate position in society.</LD>
<LD>   "It is women and girls who are overwhelmingly the casualties of
this scourge, and it is getting worse," said Stephen Lewis, the U.N.
secretary-general's special envoy on AIDS in Africa. "It is a
nightmare."</LD>
<TE>   Scientists at the 14th International AIDS Conference presented
several studies on the female face of HIV and on ways to help women
protect themselves without having to rely on men to use condoms.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to make sure that the money is going proportionately to
those who are paying proportionately the greatest price, and at the
moment, the greatest price on this planet is being paid by the women
and girls of Africa," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   A UC San Francisco study found that in Zimbabwe, rape is common
and negotiating for safe sex to prevent HIV infection is almost
impossible for many adolescent girls who become involved with older
men in return for clothes and school fees.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon of intergenerational sex is driving much of the
epidemic in southern Africa, where between one-quarter and one-third
of older men are HIV positive, said the study's leader, Nancy Padian,
director of international programs at UCSF's AIDS Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "An intervention to promote economic self-sufficiency is an
essential element in any plan to reverse the spread of HIV," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In some areas, common myths about AIDS--that sex with a virgin
cures sexually transmitted infections and that sex with condoms will
not release body heat--also work against women, Dr. Suniti Solomon,
director of the YRG Center for AIDS Research and Education in Madras,
India, told the conference.</TE>
<TE>   On average, women in these areas are becoming infected 10 years
earlier than men due to early marriages, rape or being forced into
prostitution for economic reasons, said Solomon, whose team
documented the first evidence of HIV infection in India.</TE>
<TE>   There is an urgent need for HIV prevention methods that do not
require the cooperation of the male partner, Solomon said.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility is microbicides, gels designed to kill HIV. No
microbicide has been shown to be effective yet, but more than 50
candidates are under development.</TE>

<HD>Peronist Clears a Path for Menem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>In a move that appears to boost former Argentine President Carlos
Menem's aspirations to return to power, a top governor from his
Peronist party backed away from the race Wednesday following days of
tense negotiations with party leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The decision of Gov. Carlos Reutemann laid bare the turmoil inside
the ruling party. In essence, one of the leading lights of Argentine
politics decided not to run for president because he didn't trust
fellow Peronists to support him if he was elected.</LD>
<LD>   "I never said I would be a candidate," Reutemann said Wednesday,
following days in which current President Eduardo Duhalde tried to
convince him to run. "Nothing will change my mind.... Nor will I be a
candidate for vice president."</LD>
<TE>   Argentina has been stuck in an economic, political and social
crisis since December, when rioting and protests drove Fernando de la
Rua of the center-left Alliance coalition from power following four
years of recession. Duhalde became president in January, appointed by
Congress after three other men rotated quickly through the office.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Duhalde has struggled to rule the country, with key
governors of his Peronist party, including Reutemann, balking at his
proposed budget cuts. Some of them have called for the president to
step down.</TE>
<TE>   Bowing to intense pressure, Duhalde last week said he would leave
office nine months before his term was to end. He has scheduled
presidential elections for March.</TE>
<TE>   Reutemann, governor of Santa Fe province, was the leader
considered most likely to successfully challenge Menem for the
Peronist presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Menem, a colorful and controversial figure, privatized most of the
utilities, the national oil company, the post office and much of
Argentina's transportation network during two terms as president from
1989 to 1999. He left office amid widespread allegations of
corruption and spent months under house arrest last year in
connection with an arms trafficking scandal. The charges eventually
were dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Reutemann said he had not spoken recently to Menem, who was once
his political mentor.</TE>
<TE>   "Reutemann is my friend and you shouldn't forget that he entered
politics because I encouraged him to do so," Menem said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   According to published reports here, Reutemann presented Peronist
leaders with a series of demands in recent days, saying he would run
for president only if they promised to support him once he took
office, and only if Duhalde resolved a crisis in the banking sector
before stepping down. Millions of depositors have seen their savings
frozen since last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a savior and I am not a magician," Reutemann told the
daily newspaper La Nacion on Tuesday. "If society and the politicians
are looking for that, they shouldn't knock at my door."</TE>
<TE>   Reutemann's decision to bow out of the race leaves Menem as the
most powerful Peronist seeking the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether Argentine law prevents Menem from
running for a third term.</TE>

<HD>In Israeli Lab, Some of Dead Get No Rest</HD>
<DH>Mideast: What to do about the remains of Palestinian
suicide bombers poses a vexing problem as bodies go unclaimed by
relatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAFFA, Israel</DL>
<LD>The broken bodies crowd the steel refrigerators out back, but nobody
knows what to do with them. What little is left of 25 suicide bombers
and snipers has been piling up for weeks. Usually, there is nothing
but a Palestinian head and a pair of Palestinian feet, perhaps a
charred Palestinian finger or a shard of Palestinian spine.</LD>
<LD>   The burned bits are all that remain of dead militants, men and
women who slipped across the line from the Palestinian territories,
who came to kill and came to die. When the mission is over, when the
streets are washed clean and the Jews have come to carry the bones of
their kin into the hills for burial--when everybody has gone home,
the Palestinians stay, chilled and forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   The bodies are an awkward reminder of another breakdown between
two warring people. Palestinians don't venture into Israel any more
to gather the remains of their dead. Maybe they are frightened, as
the investigators here at the only forensics laboratory in this
bloody nation believe. Or maybe the harsh net of curfews, roadblocks
and fences has made the journey impossible.</LD>
<TE>   The technicians grumble, and the director frets, and the Israeli
public complains, but the bodies stay. The attorney general's office
is expected to hammer out some sort of policy on the treatment of
unclaimed Palestinian corpses, but it's no simple task. Here in
Israel--a nation spitting with rage over Palestinian attacks, but
still a nation where the rituals of death are hallowed and bodies are
sacred--nobody knows what to do with the corpses of the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me even to say it, but the terrorist is still
entitled to be treated as a human body," Health Ministry spokesman
Ido Hadari says. "Many Israelis say one who kills babies and
schoolgirls is not somebody who can be called human."</TE>
<TE>   In the laboratory of forensic director Yehuda Hiss, the mystery of
life is reduced to the science of fingerprints and blood samples,
tattoos and DNA. "Once you smell it," he says, "you never forget."</TE>
<TE>   The laboratory's grounds near Tel Aviv look like a defunct summer
camp, a smattering of cottages lush with blooming vines and cool pine
groves. This used to be a private Mediterranean resort, the
playground of a wealthy Arab family whose name, Abu Kabir, still
graces the complex. In the bloodshed of Israel's War of Independence
in 1948, Jews seized this and other land from fleeing Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the remains of Israelis and their Arab assassins are examined
side by side in what used to be the family's stables. "Once they're
dead, they're dead," Hiss says. "There's no difference anymore."</TE>
<TE>   After a suicide attack, when the scraps of flesh and bone are
brought here and spread across his metal tables, Hiss picks out the
bomber at a glance. The bombs are cinched about the waist, and the
explosion tends to send the killer's feet and head flying out of
fire's range. When the smoke clears, that's usually all that's left.
"You know how many of these I've done?" Hiss says. "I can tell in a
second."</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when Palestinians made the trip to claim their
dead. The mothers and brothers slipped over the line from the refugee
camps and villages, padded gray and grave into Hiss' office and said,
"I think this is my son." They rolled up their sleeves and offered to
have their blood drawn so the body could be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore. Everybody knows what happens to the families of
suicide bombers. Israeli soldiers come with bombs and bulldozers to
turn the family house to dust and pebbles. The survivors are pushed
into the street. Entire villages are usually interrogated and
harassed.</TE>
<TE>   Even the militant groups that once stepped forward to crow over
the attacks have grown more hesitant to release a name, a village, or
a videotape. They want to protect the families, they say. And even if
Hamas, Islamic Jihad or another group identifies the bomber, that is
irrelevant to Hiss: At Abu Kabir, identity is gleaned only from
scientific analysis.</TE>
<TE>   In this religious land of perpetual warfare, the rites of death do
a delicate dance with the rules of combat. Because both Jews and
Muslims are supposed to bury corpses by sundown, the hours after a
killing are strained with pressure to collect the bodies and take
them back to home soil.</TE>
<TE>   Militant Palestinian organizations used to steal their fighters'
corpses from hospitals and bury them before Israeli soldiers could
figure out who they were. In March, when the morgue in Ramallah
overflowed, Israel eased the siege on the West Bank city long enough
to allow the dead to be buried. Mourning Palestinians dug a gaping
grave in the dirt of a parking lot, buried the bodies en masse, and
went back to war.</TE>
<TE>   Because Hiss is running out of storage space, he has struck a
clumsy compromise: When three months have passed, he sends the
Palestinian bodies to be buried in a collective plot on Israeli soil.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't much like to do it, because he knows the families have
a way of showing up sooner or later. He's had Jordanian relatives
stroll into his office and ask him to dig up bodies that have been in
the ground eight years, a decade, from the days of the first grueling
intifada that began in 1987. "There was skeleton only," he says with
a grim shake of his head.</TE>
<TE>   The Jewish families are different. They flock here by the
hundreds, sometimes, after the very worst attacks. When sirens scream
and death counts drone over the airwaves, frantic families swarm past
the security guards and into the compound, slam their cars into a
crazy quilt of metal, and scramble into the office.</TE>
<TE>   They register the names and the ages of the missing, give the sad
narratives that explain why he might have been on that bus, why she
could have eaten in that restaurant, danced at that discotheque.
"There's no answer on the mobile," they say. And then they wait.</TE>
<TE>   When they're called to Hiss' office, they know what it means. They
look at the white beard and glasses and neat necktie, and they often
say the same thing: I never thought I'd meet you in person. I never
believed I'd see your face. "When they see me, they know it's the
end," Hiss says. Israeli news has dubbed him the "Angel of Death."</TE>
<TE>   "I always tell them, don't look at the bodies. I speak on behalf
of the dead," he says. "I tell them it's better to remember them
alive and beautiful than covered with blood, dust, metal."</TE>
<TE>   But almost without exception, they want to see. Even if there's
nothing left but a finger or a jaw or a skull, they want to see.
"It's the worst part," Hiss says. "It's never clean."</TE>
<TE>   Now, for the first time in Hiss' 17 years here, there is a victim
nobody knows. Was he homeless or friendless, a tourist or a foreign
worker? The morning of June 5, he boarded a bus filled with soldiers
and rode through the sunflower fields of northern Israel. He and 16
others died when the bus was bombed at the Megiddo junction.</TE>
<TE>   He was middle-aged, maybe 40, maybe 60, about 5 foot 2. They've
run newspaper stories and fielded calls from Russia and Poland.</TE>
<TE>   No use. No match. If they don't find his home soon, he too will be
buried in the blank earth. He will get a number.</TE>
<TE>   He will crumble into dust without a name.</TE>

<LD>   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government moved to relax its laws on
marijuana, stopping short of legalization but guaranteeing that most
users will get off with just a warning while police focus their
enforcement efforts on harder drugs.</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposal, marijuana would be downgraded from a Class B
to a Class C drug, making its use and possession less serious crimes,
Home Secretary David Blunkett said. British police would retain the
authority to arrest those caught with marijuana, but in most cases
would simply confiscate the drug and issue a warning.</TE>

<HD>Australia Shows Off Facility</HD>
<DH>Refugees: New center to house asylum detainees will enable
closure of three camps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORT AUGUSTA, Australia</DL>
<LD>Ringed by a high electric fence, microwave motion monitors and
security cameras, the Baxter Reception and Processing Center is
Australia's newest and first detention center built specifically to
house asylum seekers.</LD>
<LD>   The government Wednesday proudly showed off the new center built
on the dusty outskirts of the isolated industrial town of Port
Augusta in South Australia state.</LD>
<LD>   Designed to hold 1,200 asylum seekers, the Baxter center will
enable the government to close at least three of its existing five
mainland centers, which have in recent years been the scene of riots,
arson, mass breakouts and self-mutilation by detainees.</LD>
<TE>   Australia detains all asylum seekers arriving here until their
visa applications are processed--which can take three years.</TE>
<TE>   Run by the Australian subsidiary of the U.S. private prison
company, Wackenhut Corrections Corp., the existing camps have been
criticized internationally and in Australia by the United Nations,
Amnesty International and parliamentary committees for abusing human
rights.</TE>
<TE>   The Baxter center is still under federal government control.</TE>
<TE>   Critics claim that the centers also psychologically damage the
men, women and children in them, mostly refugees from Afghanistan,
Iran and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The government hopes Baxter will end the controversy plaguing its
other camps, particularly the notorious Woomera center.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said Baxter tries to mix
humane living conditions with the needs of detaining people against
their will.</TE>

<HD>Canada, Mexico Oppose U.S. Stance on Court</HD>
<DH>Peacekeeping: After U.N. meeting, America offers to seek
for its troops only a one-year guarantee of immunity from
prosecution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>In a rare public alliance against Washington, Canada and Mexico on
Wednesday assailed the Bush administration's bid to shield U.S.
peacekeepers from the International Criminal Court, arguing that the
effort could damage the tribunal, jeopardize U.N. peacekeeping
missions and undermine the Security Council's authority.</LD>
<LD>   Canadian Ambassador Paul Heinbecker, in a public meeting of the
Security Council convened at his government's request, strongly urged
members to reject a U.S. proposal to preemptively halt any future
court action against American troops serving as peacekeepers.</LD>
<LD>   Canada challenges the resolution's legality, he said, because it
would in effect amend the treaty that established the court, which
began operations this month.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Heinbecker suggested, the United States should pull out
of peacekeeping missions where it cannot secure the legal protection
it is seeking through bilateral pacts with host nations. Those
agreements are allowable under the court treaty, which the U.S. has
not signed.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. withdrawal from peacekeeping "would be regrettable and
would not be without consequence, even significant consequence to
those missions," he said. "But, as the U.S. contributes 704 of 45,159
U.N. peacekeeping personnel, all told, adjustment could be made."</TE>
<TE>   After the Security Council meeting, the U.S. privately offered a
compromise, seen by European diplomats as a significant retreat from
its early position, that would seek for a one-year period a guarantee
that the court would not "commence or proceed with any investigations
or prosecutions involving current or former officials from a
contributing state" that is not a signatory to the court treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Previously the U.S. had sought an exemption that would be renewed
virtually automatically by the council every year, guaranteeing
permanent immunity for American peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   Though the U.S. proposal cites a provision of the treaty that
allows the council to halt court investigations or trials for up to a
year, treaty authors and other court advocates contend that the U.N.
body is not empowered to stop tribunal actions that might happen in
the future.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration fears that American soldiers would face
politically motivated or capricious prosecutions. It has threatened
to push through an end to U.N. backing for two peacekeeping missions
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and perhaps for other missions, unless U.S.
personnel are exempted.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats are trying to resolve the impasse before Monday, when
the second--and, according to U.S. officials, final--emergency
extension of Bosnian missions is to expire, following an American
veto of what was once expected to be a routine six-month renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, Mexico's U.N. ambassador, joined Heinbecker
in insisting that the acceptance of the U.S. proposal would set "a
dangerous precedent" for after-the-fact Security Council interference
with other international treaties.</TE>
<TE>   Like Heinbecker, Aguilar questioned the legal competence of the
council to limit the court's authority.</TE>
<TE>   Canada and Mexico, though normally supportive of the U.S., have
domestic political reasons to challenge their superpower neighbor on
this sensitive issue. For Canada, long a leading contributor of
troops to U.N. missions, any threat to peacekeeping is seen as a
threat to its own foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the government of Mexican President Vicente Fox, which
is seeking to get the court treaty ratified in its fractious
Congress, is pursuing an activist international human rights agenda
as a way of distinguishing itself from its strong-arm predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   And Mexico and Canada are hardly alone in their views here: Of the
two dozen ambassadors speaking in Wednesday's debate in the Security
Council, only India's U.N. envoy expressed any support for the U.S.
position. Representatives of the European Union, the Latin American
bloc and the new African Union challenged American assertions that
the tribunal might place U.S. peacekeepers at legal risk.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the court fear that Britain and other council powers
ultimately will yield to U.S. pressure and agree to some formula
protecting peacekeeping personnel who come from nations that have not
signed the court treaty.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Europeans conclude that the choice is between the court
and peacekeeping, they may decide for peacekeeping," said William
Pace, the head of an international human rights coalition that worked
to establish the new global tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   John D. Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., told the
council Wednesday, "Failure to address concerns about placing
peacekeepers in legal jeopardy before the [International Criminal
Court] can impede the provision of peacekeepers to the U.N. It
certainly will affect our ability to contribute peacekeepers."</TE>
<TE>   Britain and France have expressed concern that further U.S.
disengagement from its already limited peacekeeping role would
undermine the U.N.'s clout.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Palestinian gunmen fired on Israeli troops searching for smuggling
tunnels Wednesday along the sandy border with Egypt, killing an army
lieutenant--the first Israeli to die in the last 20 days of the
Mideast conflict.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate shooting, a Palestinian teenager was killed when
Israeli soldiers fired on stone-throwers in the northern West Bank
city of Nablus, Palestinians said.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a prominent Palestinian moderate, Sari Nusseibeh, said
he has spent the last several months quietly working on a Middle East
peace proposal with Ami Ayalon, the former head of Israel's Shin Bet
security service. Both men were in Greece this week for meetings. The
plan is to be presented to both sides as a petition, Nusseibeh said
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli army Lt. Haggai Lev was hit by a sniper while he and other
soldiers were looking for the underground passages in the southern
part of the Gaza Strip, the army said. In recent months, Israeli
forces have found about a dozen tunnels used to smuggle weapons and
drugs. The tunnels begin on the Egyptian side and emerge inside
Palestinian homes in the border town of Rafah.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, affiliated with Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed responsibility for
the shooting in announcements at several mosques in Rafah.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military said soldiers found and destroyed a
weapons-smuggling tunnel Wednesday morning in the area where the

<HD>Suspect Freed Pending Trial in Visa Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Jordanian is one of 71 people suspected of paying
$10,000 each to get papers in Qatar. He and two others have been
linked to Sept. 11 figures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Jordanian was released from custody Wednesday pending trial on visa
fraud charges, as State Department officials confirmed that they are
investigating how he and two other men with links to suspected Sept.
11 hijackers obtained visas from the U.S. Embassy in Qatar.</LD>
<LD>   Rasmi Subhi Salah al Shannaq was one of at least 71 people who
paid $10,000 or more over the last several years to get the visas
from someone working at the embassy in Doha, capital of the Persian
Gulf sheikdom, according to senior State Department officials.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have launched a nationwide manhunt for 29 people
believed to be holding illicit visas--mostly Jordanians and
Pakistanis--and have detained 31 others who also entered the United
States.</LD>
<TE>   Among those taken into custody were Al Shannaq and two other men
who spent several months last year sharing a Virginia apartment with
two of the suspected hijackers, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Six other alleged buyers of the fraudulent visas have fled the
country and an additional five were spouses or children.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Baltimore ordered Al Shannaq freed Wednesday
after a prosecutor said that, despite the Jordanian's links to
suspected hijackers Hani Hanjour and Nawaf Alhazmi, he appears to
have had no involvement in the September attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Assistant U.S. Atty. Harvey Eisenberg told the judge
that authorities remain interested in Al Shannaq and two other men
who allegedly roomed with Hanjour and Alhazmi: Ahmed Ahmed and
another man whose name has not been disclosed by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "We have legitimate questions," Eisenberg told U.S. Magistrate
Susan Gauvey. "We want to know as best we can in a free society what
went on there."</TE>
<TE>   The judge ordered that Al Shannaq be kept under 24-hour electronic
monitoring at his parents' home until trial. She did not set a date
for the next court proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Hanjour and Alhazmi were aboard American Airlines Flight 77, which
crashed into the Pentagon during the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department and the FBI are investigating whether there
are terrorist links to Al Shannaq or any of the 70 others who
allegedly received illegal visas, a senior State Department official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The official said Ahmed and the third roommate are being held and
that at least eight men who participated in the alleged visa scheme
have raised suspicions among FBI officials for their apparent
involvement in some kind of terrorist or criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   Al Shannaq, 27, was arrested in Baltimore on June 24 and indicted
by a grand jury last week.</TE>
<TE>   He was charged with unlawfully obtaining a nonimmigrant U.S. visa,
an offense that carries a penalty of up to 10 years in jail and up to
$250,000 in fines, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Court-appointed attorney Jim Wyda said his client has no
connection to any kind of terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   In a briefing Wednesday, State Department officials discussed
their ongoing investigation into the alleged visa fraud, which they
have dubbed Operation Eagle Strike. They said the probe started with
a tip from an informant in November that an employee of the U.S.
Embassy in Qatar was granting fraudulent visas for at least $10,000
each.</TE>
<TE>   Local and U.S. employees at the embassy in Qatar are under
investigation. So far, however, State Department officials have not
figured out how the 71 people came into possession of the fraudulent
visas, or who solicited the payments from them.</TE>
<TE>   While authorities believe someone "on the inside" helped
orchestrate the scheme for profit, "we don't know what actually
happened," said another department official.</TE>
<TE>   At least three U.S. Embassy officials are under investigation by
the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service for allegedly
playing a role in the scheme, after their signatures were found on
fraudulent visas, one official said. So far, none has been charged,
disciplined or suspended.</TE>
<TE>   And while 71 fraudulent visas have been identified, "there may
well be more," said the senior State Department official.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the living room of his luxurious 10,000-square-foot midtown
Manhattan apartment, Francesco Galesi built an empire that earned him
a winter villa near Jamaica's Montego Bay, a 12-bedroom oceanfront
castle on Long Island and a net worth of more than $400 million that
once ranked him halfway up the Forbes 400 list of America's
wealthiest.</LD>
<LD>   Galesi made his millions in real estate.</LD>
<LD>   He lost much of it in telecommunications--more than $70 million
and counting in a frustrated 20-year effort to build a national
telephone network in one of the most competitive, cutthroat and
mercurial industries.</LD>
<TE>   The story of this self-made son of an Italian immigrant might be
just another human saga in the multibillion-dollar boom and bust of
America's telecom sector were it not for Galesi's one major success.</TE>
<TE>   Galesi is one of the longest- serving directors of WorldCom Inc.
He is one of just four board members on the crippled company's audit
committee, which signed off on years' worth of cooked books that the
company now says misstated nearly $4 billion in costs as revenue. And
he is the man responsible for recruiting Scott D. Sullivan,
WorldCom's "whiz-kid" chief financial officer, who was fired last
month for what the company called his central role in what has become
one of America's biggest corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether the WorldCom board or its audit
committee knew of the misstatements at the time. But Galesi is among
a handful of WorldCom directors who are defendants in a blizzard of
class-action shareholder lawsuits filed in recent weeks against
America's second-largest long-distance company, after its stock
tanked from a high of $65 a share three years ago to just 20 cents
today.</TE>
<TE>   At 71, the intensely private Galesi--whose press clippings are
confined mainly to gossip items about his Long Island social life and
Russian princess wife--apparently still sits atop a real estate
fortune that stretches from New York to Texas. Galesi reportedly
parlayed a borrowed $4 million that he invested in an abandoned U.S.
Army dump in upstate New York in 1960 into a network of industrial
parks worth well more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Galesi has not spoken publicly of WorldCom since the accounting
debacle. His lawyers either have declined to comment or have not
returned calls seeking his version of events that led up to it. A
raft of federal investigations is underway to reconstruct them, by
congressional committees and by the federal agencies that were
responsible for monitoring the telephone and Internet conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   But thousands of pages of documents in federal courthouses in New
York and Chicago and at the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington open a window on WorldCom's world through the adventures
of one of its earliest and presumably more influential board
members--much of the record in Galesi's own words while under oath.</TE>
<TE>   The documents also provide clues to what went so wrong at
WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Galesi's attempts to build his own major long-
distance network even while serving on WorldCom's board is, in many
ways, emblematic of the rise and fall of WorldCom. Galesi's costly
and ambitious telecom ventures both parallel and intersect those of
WorldCom founder Bernard J. Ebbers, who was ousted as chief executive
in April when it was revealed that he owed WorldCom $408 million to
cover loans he used to buy company stock.</TE>
<TE>   As Ebbers gobbled up about 70 companies in just over a decade,
sometimes sweeping their principals onto the board of the emerging
WorldCom, the potential for conflicts of interest that could violate
securities laws mounted exponentially, the documents show.</TE>
<TE>   That appeared especially true for Galesi, who continued to try to
create another telecom giant both before and after he sold one of his
early ventures to Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawyers who specialize in telecommunications, including
some who have opposed Galesi in court, said Galesi appeared to take
pains to avoid using his WorldCom insider position to benefit his own
companies. To do so, they said, probably would have been illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Such insider conflicts are targets of the SEC's investigation of
WorldCom and a prime focus of another probe launched by Congress on
Monday. And under the business reform proposals advanced by President
Bush in his Wall Street speech Tuesday, there would be restrictions
on who could serve on a corporate board's internal audit committee.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of WorldCom's board--and particularly its audit
committee--is among the investigators' other chief targets. On that
score, Galesi's telecom track record reflects what some critics say
may have contributed to WorldCom's undoing: key directors and
managers--including former basketball coach and motel owner Ebbers
and real estate magnate Galesi--who had little or no hands-on
experience in an emerging industry that not even experts could
reliably analyze.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare interview in 1990, the 1953 Princeton graduate tried to
explain why, after amassing a fortune Forbes estimated that year at
$435 million largely in real estate assets, he was so bent upon
building an empire in the burgeoning yet perilous telecommunications
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "A person's work is his life. A person has to work at what excites
him," Galesi told the trade publication FCC Week. "A life of
self-indulgence doesn't excite me. Yes, I like making deals. But it's
not the reason.</TE>
<TE>   "Telecommunications," Galesi said, "excites me."</TE>
<TE>   Galesi got plenty of excitement in the years ahead--a trail awash
in red ink, bankruptcies and at least a few regrets for a man
described even by lawyers who opposed him as "gracious," "elegant,"
"charming," "cooperative" or, at worst, "naive."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Francesco Galesi is a legit, stand-up guy who's not
surrounded by the best advisors," said one lawyer familiar with the
bankruptcies who asked not to be named. "He's too patrician to
realize that in this business, people are going to swipe the nickels
off the newsstand."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Galesi's first foray into telecom was named Argo Communications.
It was a joint venture in the mid-1980s in the long-distance market
just emerging after the court-ordered breakup of the AT&amp;T Corp.
monopoly. Argo was named for the mythic ship that Jason and his
Argonauts took to wrest the Golden Fleece from a dragon.</TE>
<TE>   "I just decided that I wanted to diversify from real estate, and I
thought that would be a good business to get into," Galesi explained
under oath more than a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, court records show, it was Galesi who appeared to have
been fleeced. Argo's largest shareholder, a telephone company called
Centel, stripped Argo of most of its assets to prepare it for a
merger. But at the last minute, Centel's board voted against the
merger, and there was so little left of Argo it had to be liquidated.</TE>
<TE>   Galesi sued Centel, but according to a lawyer familiar with the
case, "he never got a penny," losing an investment that trade
journals estimated was worth at least $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, a Galesi investment in a pioneering satellite-TV
company failed when its lead financier pulled out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very disappointing," Galesi told Business Week magazine in a
1987 interview. "I've never lost money before."</TE>
<TE>   But the experience taught Galesi a lesson: "From now on," he
concluded, "I retain total control."</TE>
<TE>   It was an axiom for success in telecommunications that WorldCom
founder Ebbers also was learning about the same time. And soon, the
two men's paths would cross.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, Galesi bought several small phone companies in Florida to
form Telus Communications. This time, Galesi recalled, Telus "was
wholly owned by me." Within two years, Telus became Florida's
second-largest long-distance carrier.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1989 deal that helped establish the industry pattern of
acquisitions and mergers that WorldCom used to become a global giant,
Galesi fused his company with Atlanta's leading long-distance
carrier, Advanced Telecommunications, to form a new regional giant.
With 25% of the shares, Galesi was the largest shareholder of the
newly formed ATC. And two years later, ATC was acquired by Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers eventually named the new company he built with such mergers
WorldCom. Through the ATC merger, Galesi got more than 5 million
shares and a permanent seat on the company's board.</TE>
<TE>   The same year that Ebbers bought ATC, Galesi bought the abandoned
and bat-infested 55,000-square-foot Dragon's Head mansion on Long
Island and began sinking in millions on renovations, renaming it
Elysium--in mythology, a place of perfect bliss.</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, Galesi's WorldCom stock alone would be valued at more
than $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   As for Ebbers, he got more than Galesi's regional long-distance
powerhouse: He got Galesi's original numbers man from Telus, a bright
young accountant named Scott D. Sullivan. Within two years, Sullivan
would become Ebbers' chief financial officer and right-hand man.</TE>
<TE>   "Scott," Galesi was quoted as saying two years ago, "knows how to
make the numbers come together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Telus success wasn't enough for Galesi. In court depositions
related to one of Galesi's messiest telecom bankruptcies, he said
that from almost the moment he sold Telus, he started building
another telecom network.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that this would put him in direct competition with
Ebbers, on whose board Galesi soon would sit.</TE>
<TE>   While Ebbers was furiously building WorldCom in the South from its
Mississippi base, Galesi looked to the North. In 1989 he invested $15
million in cash in a struggling suburban Chicago company called
Telesphere Communications.</TE>
<TE>   It would prove to be a disastrous move that spoke volumes about
the volatile telecom industry--and the many corporate carcasses that
preceded WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   Telesphere, whose business consisted of operator assistance and
900-number services, had lost about $28 million the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   "Telesphere," Galesi said in an April 2000 deposition, "was a
small, sick company on the verge of bankruptcy. And it had a terrible
reputation. The vision was simply to cut expenses and put in decent
management to try to improve its business and increase its business.
That's all."</TE>
<TE>   So Galesi tapped his personal lawyer, Joseph W. Bartlett, a
prominent Manhattan attorney who taught finance at Stanford
University and New York University and wrote books on corporate
finance. He also brought to the board former U.S. Treasury
undersecretary George D. Gould, former SEC Chief Executive A. Jones
Yorke and a well-known marketing executive, Harry R. Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Galesi had known these men for years--from tennis matches and
social bashes in the Hamptons, from the exclusive Tryall Club near
Jamaica's Montego Bay, from ski trips to Vermont in the '50s, from
the corporate pool of late-20th-century elite.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew, you know, most of the leading people on Wall Street,"
Galesi recalled two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But they weren't enough. Although his new board members seemed to
be corporate pillars beyond reproach, they--like the WorldCom board
that was forming itself through acquisitions--knew little about
telecommunications.</TE>
<TE>   As Telesphere launched into its first merger, it began to fall
apart. Galesi pledged some of his own stock in what would become
WorldCom in a leveraged buyout of a Washington-area telecom company
that came with so much baggage that it helped bury Telesphere.</TE>
<TE>   There was another dimension to Telesphere's failure, though.
Galesi, who played host to several of the company's board meetings
over lunch in his Manhattan apartment and took a keen interest in its
operations, also brought in a management team that included key
executives from his failed Argo Communications and from Telus.</TE>
<TE>   The process revealed both Galesi's WorldCom overlaps and the
incestuous nature of what Galesi himself called "a very small
industry--we all knew each other."</TE>
<TE>   Said one of Galesi's former managers, who later went to work for
Ebbers: "At times it seemed like there were only 100 of us, and we
kept moving around."</TE>
<TE>   Not only was Galesi competing against Ebbers' company while
sitting on its board, but Galesi's CFO at Telesphere, Scott Lee
Drake, also left for an investment banking firm that had both
companies as clients and then went to work for Ebbers himself.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at a deposition about this seeming conflict of interest,
Drake insisted he had no contact with Galesi while under contract to
Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   Telesphere continues to haunt Galesi. He is seeking to recover $3
million he lent the company in its dying days, and the company's
liquidating trust is seeking about $30 million from Galesi, who faces
a possible civil trial in the case this year on a claim that he
controlled Telesphere and is responsible for its collapse.</TE>
<TE>   But not even Telesphere's demise deterred Galesi from trying to
get into the market yet again. In 1997, even as the Telesphere
bankruptcy swirled around him, Galesi and his companies bought a
controlling interest in another troubled telecommunications company,
in New Rochelle, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Amnex Inc. owned more than 10,000 pay phones in Florida, New York
and New Jersey. It didn't seem to matter to Galesi that cell phones
were pushing pay phones toward obsolescence. Galesi figured to expand
the company--again through acquisition, merger and new management.
Galesi brought in some of the same folks who had run the failed
Telesphere.</TE>
<TE>   In all, SEC filings show, Galesi pumped more than $10 million into
Amnex in the ensuing two years to fund operations and an acquisition
as ill-timed as Telesphere's. Amnex filed for bankruptcy protection
in May 1999; the case also remains unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   Under oath two years ago, Galesi reflected on the Amnex venture:
"It was a troubled, very troubled company. It was probably a mistake
on my part to have gotten involved with it to begin with. It was too
far gone."</TE>
<TE>   But for Galesi, the excitement apparently was not in the bottom
line. It was in the FCC Week interview 12 years ago that he gave a
glimpse of what drives him--and perhaps WorldCom colleague Ebbers,
who, like Galesi, appears to have lost much of what he put into the
company.</TE>
<TE>   "Just making money is gross," Galesi was quoted as saying. "I
don't think about conspicuous consumption. I don't sit around
thinking about becoming a billionaire."</TE>

<HD>Filming Without the Film</HD>
<DH>High-definition digital cameras, feared by some directors,
could end the careers of those unable to make the transition.</DH>

<DL>NICASIO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Oliver Stone stared in disbelief. Here he was, sitting in a velvet
seat in George Lucas' private screening room, listening to the "Star
Wars" director foretell the death of film.</LD>
<LD>   To Stone, director of such films as "Platoon" and "JFK," Lucas'
vision of digital movie making sounded like blasphemy. Around him,
other A-list directors--including Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford
Coppola and Robert Zemeckis--fidgeted as Lucas challenged a century
of tradition, warning his colleagues to embrace the future or be left
behind.</LD>
<LD>   Lucas' blunt message stands at the center of a schism in Hollywood
over the fate of film in the film business. New high-definition video
cameras and digital editing equipment challenge the longtime
supremacy of film. They are cheaper and more flexible. But they also
frighten directors and cinematographers who understand every nuance
of film.</LD>
<TE>   A creative misstep can tarnish a career, so many of those
established in the film industry blanch at the thought of showing
their inexperience with the latest technology. A colossal mistake,
seen by millions of fans, might reveal that they are passe
storytellers--easily replaced with younger, cheaper and more
tech-savvy rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "Film is what we do. It's what we use," Stone sniped at Lucas.
"You'll be known as the man who killed cinema."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas merely rolled his eyes as Stone waxed about the poetry of
celluloid and the coldness of pixels.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, according to those who were there, Lucas interrupted.</TE>
<TE>   "Just watch."</TE>
<TE>   Raising a hand, Lucas cued his demonstration and told his audience
what they would see: identical clips--each stored on different
formats--from the animated movie "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   One was completely electronic--compiled by a computer, stored on
digital tape and shown through a digital projector. In footage
looking less like a motion picture and more like an open window onto
a real world, the monsters gabbed in crisp clarity and rich tones.</TE>
<TE>   Next came a traditional film reel that spent four weeks in a mall
theater. With each showing, heat from the projector and dust in the
air faded and degraded the reel. The difference was jarring.
Radically out of focus, the film reel cast an image on the screen
that jiggled and popped, as if an earthquake were rocking the
projector.</TE>
<TE>   Lights came up as the demonstration ended. No one spoke for
several seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Debate within the industry is not nearly so quiet.</TE>
<TE>   For directors such as Lucas, the choice is obvious. Breaking new
ground for major motion pictures, his "Star Wars: Episode II Attack
of the Clones" was shot entirely with high-definition digital
cameras, edited with digital equipment and, for a few dozen theaters,
distributed and projected digitally.</TE>
<TE>   Testing the Technology</TE>
<TE>   Spotting the change, a growing number of filmmakers have been
testing the digital waters. From students and independent filmmakers
capturing their low-budget works on digital video to established
directors such as Michael Mann testing high-definition cameras in
"Ali," they are curious about the new tools and fearful of being left
behind.</TE>
<TE>   But after nearly a century of using film, much of Hollywood's old
guard is reluctant to shift gears, a reticence that speaks to a
powerful culture of fear among some of the industry's most elite
directors.</TE>
<TE>   "Film is rather like the magic lantern. There's a sense of
mystery, because you don't know what's going into the magic black-box
camera until you send the film to the lab," said cinematographer
Roger Deakins, director of photography for Ron Howard's film "A
Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   "With digital, it's all very businesslike," Deakins said. "We're
not businessmen. We're artists and magicians."</TE>
<TE>   Despite significant advances in the art and science of film since
the first roll of flexible celluloid was produced in 1889, the basic
process remains the same: Chemicals layered on the surface of the
film react when they are exposed to light, changing into hues that
match the light's wavelength.</TE>
<TE>   Digital cameras, which began to appear in the mid-1990s, use
powerful computer chips that convert light into electronic pulses,
which they then translate into data and store on videotape.</TE>
<TE>   With the first cameras, the images were unusually crisp and
realistic but no match for the smooth lines and range of colors
delivered by 35-millimeter film. Those differences stemmed partly
from the cameras' chips, which couldn't capture as much information
as film, and partly from the technology used to shrink and store the
data.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Corp., Panasonic and other manufacturers developed
high-definition digital cameras in the late 1990s that could deliver
far more detail and a wider range of color. This summer, Thomson
Grass Valley is bringing out a new line of cameras that can capture
almost five times as much detail and twice the range of color as
previous high-definition models, said Jeff Rosica, vice president of
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Frugality also is pushing studios and filmmakers to consider
digital tools. Advocates insist that the technology cuts costs,
partly by eliminating key parts of the movie-making process. For
example, there's the time-honored--and time-consuming--ritual of
handling "dailies."</TE>
<TE>   When a day of shooting wraps, the crew sends the footage to a
processing lab. After the film negatives have been developed, the
reel is returned to the set. The director and often the crew gather
inside a screening room. Then they cross their fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Shoot-and-Pray Method</TE>
<TE>   What they want to see up on the screen--and what the camera
actually captured--aren't always the same. Perhaps the spotlights
burned too brightly and washed out the image. Maybe the director
didn't spot the catering truck parked in the background. If someone
loaded the film into the camera incorrectly, the reel might be blank.</TE>
<TE>   "With film, you get 60% of what you want," said director Robert
Rodriguez. "In film, cinematography is the art of guessing."</TE>
<TE>   Each mistake, each reshoot, eats up time and money. The
shoot-and-pray cycle is nearly erased with digital cameras, because
the images can be viewed instantly.</TE>
<TE>   By replacing film in the cameras with videotape and speeding the
flow of work, Lucas saved at least $3 million in production costs on
"Attack of the Clones," producer Rick McCallum said. That's a small
fraction of the movie's $100-million budget, but "when you're
financing it yourself, and you're financing the marketing, anything
you can do to be more cost-efficient helps," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The need to cut production costs led News Corp.-owned 20th Century
Fox Television and the executive team behind the series "The
Education of Max Bickford" to take the digital plunge. The tactic
worked, said producer Rod Halcomb, who estimated that the crew saved
as much as $25,000 per episode in post-production and filming costs.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the savings and technical innovation, no tool could
save "Max Bickford": CBS dropped the series after its first year.</TE>
<TE>   "Digital technology is the director's friend, just in principle.
Because of it, directors can come closer to realizing what's in their
minds," said director Ron Howard. "I'm open to it. I'm just not open
to using it until all the bugs are worked out."</TE>
<TE>   A Digital Weak Spot</TE>
<TE>   Managing the problems of a digital set remains a daunting task,
since such "bugs" can eat up much of the savings that the digital
process promises.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the ashy dust of the Mojave Desert, just up a worn road from
the boarded-up Oasis Motel, "Confidential Report 001" director Chris
Coppola sits and waits impatiently for the crew to set up the
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "This was supposed to be a $600,000 independent film," said
Coppola, nephew of Francis Ford Coppola. "Now, we're way, way over
budget."</TE>
<TE>   The culprit, the younger Coppola said, is the high-definition
gear. Two of the Sony cameras died in the last month as dust and heat
made the computer electronics useless. The cameras' computer chips,
which are sensitive to distance, can require more time to set up a
shot than traditional gear. Then there was the mysterious blue pixel.</TE>
<TE>   "We played back the footage and there it is, in random spots: a
single blue pixel," said director of photography Andrew Giannetta.
"No one knows why. Even Sony told us, 'We don't know what's wrong. If
you figure it out, and figure out how to fix it, tell us.' "</TE>
<TE>   One of the most difficult artistic hurdles is manipulating
the look of the footage. Film blurs colors together around their edges,
but digital cameras achieve a clarity that strikes some as harsh.</TE>
<TE>   Unexpected Clarity</TE>
<TE>   For filmmakers such as Rodriguez, this sense of clarity fits into
his stylized action films. While recently shooting actor Johnny Depp
in "Once Upon a Time in Mexico," the director relied solely on
digital cameras.</TE>
<TE>   The tools picked up every detail, and uncovered the unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought Johnny Depp's eyes were black," Rodriguez said.
"On the playback monitor, I realized they are really a light caramel
color. If the eyes are the window of the soul, what ... are we doing
shooting film and blurring that window?"</TE>
<TE>   Reality, however, doesn't fit into the vision of every filmmaker.
For some, manipulating what the eye sees is the goal.</TE>
<TE>   While working on the "Max Bickford" series, director of
photography Michael Mayers tried pairing various digital cameras with
the lenses and filters he often used when shooting with traditional
film.</TE>
<TE>   Again and again, the equipment from these two worlds failed to
work together and fell short of giving him the look he wanted. The
images appeared far too sharp for the softer, cinematic feel of the
script, Mayers said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he found his solution at the grocery store: Saran
Wrap. The plastic sheets, when attached to a camera lens, gave the
footage a subtle diffusion he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everyone is comfortable taking on this type of challenge,"
said Eric Brevig, an Academy Award-winning visual-effects supervisor
at Lucas' special effects shop, Industrial Light &amp; Magic. "A lot of
people are testing out high-definition cameras in secret. They're
terrified of making mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   They have reason to be, as the technological evolution in movies
has left behind a landscape littered with casualties. When sound was
added to film, thousands of musicians lost their jobs because
theaters no longer employed live orchestras to accompany silent
movies. A generation of actors failed to make the transition, and
directors weren't spared.</TE>
<TE>   Onetime Hollywood giants such as Rex Ingram, who directed "The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse," and Fred Niblo, who directed
"Ben-Hur" and Douglas Fairbanks Sr. in "The Mark of Zorro," quickly
disappeared as the new tools became part of daily life.</TE>
<TE>   Digital cameras herald a similar and potentially traumatic shift.
Directors and cinematographers face a terrifying question: What
happens if you lack the skills to continue telling stories in a world
in which the narrative tools have fundamentally changed?</TE>
<TE>   "You become afraid," said cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. "I'd
spent 20 years learning how to use a film camera. Now, I had to pick
up something new, and there were all these other people who were far
better at using this new technology than I was."</TE>
<TE>   While working as director of photography on "Ali," Lubezki spent
time scouting locations and photographing them in the middle of the
night using a digital video camera.</TE>
<TE>   The result "was so different and interesting," he said, that
director Michael Mann asked him to re- create the surreal feel of the
footage with a film camera. After weeks of experimentation, the
cinematographer realized he couldn't do it. The only alternative was
to use a high-definition digital camera--something he had never used.</TE>
<TE>   "I took classes. I made mistakes," Lubezki said. "I was afraid. I
didn't know if I could make it work. But I did, and it was worth it.
This is different from film. Not better or worse but different. You
can't let fear of the unknown prevent you from taking that chance."</TE>
<TE>   Oliver Stone agrees. Several days after seeing the digital camera
demonstration at Lucas' ranch, Stone called an executive at ILM.</TE>
<TE>   The firm had been responsible for figuring out how to make the
connection between the digital camera and the post-production effects
work on the latest "Star Wars" movie and has close ties to several
camera manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, I know you're going to shoot me for this," Stone said to
the executive. "But I'm starting work on a new project. Do you know
where I can get ahold of some high-def cameras?"</TE>

<HD>U.S. Joins Beating Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Inglewood: Ashcroft sends his civil rights chief to help
investigate the videotaped punching of a handcuffed teenager. The
officer admits hitting the 16-year-old.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU, MITCHELL LANDSBERG and BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft dispatched his top civil rights lawyer to
Southern California on Wednesday to help investigate the videotaped
police beating of a 16-year-old Inglewood boy, as local prosecutors
began bringing witnesses before a grand jury.</LD>
<LD>   The officer seen on the tape, Jeremy Morse, has been the subject
of repeated complaints to the Inglewood Police Department, court and
police records show, and now faces the possibility of assault charges
in the alleged attack on Donovan Jackson. He also was named, along
with the city of Inglewood, Los Angeles County and five other law
enforcement officers, in a lawsuit filed Wednesday by Jackson's
family.</LD>
<LD>   In a report written Saturday night, apparently before police
became aware of the existence of a videotape, Morse acknowledged
having punched Jackson, authorities said. He said he had done so only
after the handcuffed boy grabbed Morse's testicles.</LD>
<TE>   It is not clear whether Morse said the boy grabbed him before or
after the officer picked Jackson up and threw him face first on the
trunk of a police cruiser, the act that is most prominent in the
videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's lawyer, John Barnett of Orange, criticized officials for
what he called their "rush to judgment based on a video."</TE>
<TE>   "Public figures are already declaring the officer guilty before
finding out what happened," Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett, who won the 1992 state court acquittal of Los Angeles
Police Officer Theodore Briseno in the Rodney King beating, added:
"It is disturbing that elected officials, including the mayor of the
city where the officer works, have already made up their minds what
happened. It creates an image of guilt in the public conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn, a former Superior Court judge,
said Tuesday that Morse appeared to have committed four crimes,
including felony assault.</TE>
<TE>   Morse, 24, was relieved of duty Monday after the videotape--taken
by a man who was staying in a motel across the street from the gas
station where the incident occurred--began airing publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies say Morse and three other
Inglewood police officers had arrived at the gas station where
deputies were tussling with the boy. The deputies said they had been
questioning Jackson's father about expired tags on his car's license
plates when they became involved in a confrontation with the son, who
was failing to obey their orders. Family members say Jackson has a
mental impairment that causes him to react very slowly to commands.</TE>
<TE>   The national profile of the case, raised through repeated
broadcasts of the videotape on television news, was lifted still
higher when Ashcroft expressed concern and announced that he was
taking the unusual step of sending Ralph Boyd, the head of the
Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, to take a direct role in
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd worked extensively with city officials in Cincinnati last
year after allegations of police brutality and racism sparked rioting
there. He was expected to meet with Inglewood officials today.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general called Dorn on Wednesday morning to offer his
support in defusing racial tensions. Jackson is black, Morse is
white, and some community activists have charged that the case is an
example of racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   "The role of law enforcement officers in our society is to protect
and serve the American people. The events caught on videotape in
Inglewood, Calif., last weekend trouble me greatly, because they
raise clear questions about whether that law enforcement mission was
being served properly in Inglewood," Ashcroft said in a written
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Ashcroft acknowledged that his proclamation was unusual
because it could suggest that he was prejudging an investigation that
is still in its infancy.</TE>
<TE>   But a senior Justice Department official said "this has become a
very public issue, and [Ashcroft] felt there was a real need to let
the public know how concerned he was about this."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and local authorities have opened separate civil rights
investigations into Jackson's arrest and beating. The FBI is expected
to deliver a preliminary report on its findings within 30 days to FBI
headquarters and the Justice Department in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The episode has evoked bitter memories of the notorious Rodney
King beating in 1991. Federal authorities intervened in that case as
well, convicting two LAPD officers on federal civil rights charges in
King's beating after they and two others had been acquitted in state
court.</TE>
<TE>   While the two cases have obvious similarities--both were secretly
videotaped, and King, like Jackson, is black--there also are
significant differences. One is that police immediately reported
using force in the Jackson case, something they did not do with King.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's account was contained in a section of the Inglewood police
incident report read to The Times on Wednesday. It contained the
first explanation of why the officer hit the boy, who had been
slammed onto the trunk of a patrol car, his hands handcuffed behind
his back.</TE>
<TE>   The report, written by Morse and his partner, Bijan Darvish, said
they "assisted Jackson to his feet and had him stand facing the
police vehicle." On the video, it is apparent that Morse slammed
Jackson down on the trunk of the patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   The report then says Jackson "used his right hand and reached
backward, grabbing Officer Morse in the crotch area. Officer Morse
yelled at Jackson to let go. However, Jackson refused and began to
squeeze Officer Morse by his testicles.</TE>
<TE>   "Due to the extreme pain that Officer Morse was in and the fact
that Jackson was still attacking, Officer Morse used his right fist
and punched Jackson one time on the right side of his face," the
report said. "Jackson then immediately let his grip loose of Officer
Morse."</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Morse is standing close behind Jackson at that point,
but it is unclear from the camera angle whether the boy could have
grabbed the police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the allegation that the boy grabbed Morse, an attorney
for Jackson, Joe Hopkins, said, "The way I understand it, it was the
other way around." However, he added: "I don't understand the
specific chronology of events."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Pettit, who identified himself as Morse's stepfather during
a telephone interview, said his stepson telephoned him after the
incident and said he had acted in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He actually called me after it happened," said Pettit, who lives
in the Pacific Northwest. "He said the guy had him by the
[testicles]. He didn't have no choice." Pettit described Morse as a
"good, Christian kid" who became a police officer to help people.</TE>
<TE>   He also insisted that his stepson is not a bigot. Pettit said
Morse grew up in a racially mixed neighborhood and has a Latina
girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeremy is not a racist in any way," Pettit said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Inglewood police report, another account of the
incident is contained in a separate report written by sheriff's
deputies, also on Saturday night, before the videotape aired on TV.
It alleges that Jackson fought with Deputy Carlos Lopez and Inglewood
police officers as they attempted to handcuff him.</TE>
<TE>   He "pulled, scratched and fought with the victims [police
officers] requiring Inglewood police ... to strike the subject
[Jackson] with personal weapons on his facial area," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said "personal weapons" refers to officers'
fists.</TE>
<TE>   Two sheriff's deputies, Lopez and Daniel Leon, appeared before a
grand jury Wednesday after being subpoenaed by Los Angeles County
Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley. The subpoenas were issued only after a
deputy district attorney tried to sit in on an internal Sheriff's
Department review of the case, but was asked to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and Leon had been scheduled to be interviewed by the
Sheriff's Department's Internal Affairs investigators. When the
deputy district attorney arrived, the deputies' attorney objected,
according to several Sheriff's Department sources.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney, Richard Shinee, said that it was an administrative
review and that he did not want the deputy district attorney to be
present, the sources said. Shinee refused to discuss any details of
the investigation with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   After Cooley issued the subpoenas, the deputies attended the grand
jury hearing with Shinee, Sheriff's Department sources said. The
deputies were expected to return to the grand jury today.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the target of a grand jury investigation is invited,
not subpoenaed, to attend, several defense attorneys said. They said
it would appear, then, that prosecutors wanted the deputies to
provide information for possible indictments against others, not
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office does not customarily speak about
grand jury investigations before they are completed. However, in an
unusual exchange on a radio talk show Wednesday, Chief Deputy Dist.
Atty. Curt Livesay pointedly warned Mitchell Crooks, the man who shot
the video of the incident, to answer a subpoena to appear before the
grand jury today.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks was being interviewed on the John &amp; Ken show on KFI-FM when
he said he was willing to cooperate with authorities, but was worried
that he might face unspecified charges.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, the radio hosts introduced Livesay, who is
second-in-command at the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "Mitchell, let me assure you that there is a grand jury subpoena
for you, and I suggest you honor it," Livesay told Crooks. "You show
up at the Criminal Courts Building--that's downtown, 210 W. Temple
[Street] and be there promptly ... at the grand jury."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, well I hope the city rallies behind me," Crooks replied.
"They're coming after me because I shot the video. I fear for my
life."</TE>
<TE>   "Mitchell, this is Livesay," the prosecutor shot back. "We want
you before the grand jury, not in a cell somewhere. We want you
before the grand jury and we want that original tape."</TE>
<TE>   With Morse and Jackson at the center of what was rapidly becoming
a national case, more details emerged Wednesday about each of them.</TE>
<TE>   Two people filed a lawsuit Wednesday charging Morse and another
officer with striking them in January, and documents and interviews
point to several other complaints involving the officer. Not all of
the other cases involved violence, but in one, 22-year-old Akkilah
Artiga of Inglewood alleged that Morse struck her with a baton in the
course of breaking up a party she attended last New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood police would not comment on the allegations against
Morse, but none has resulted in legal action against him, and his
lawyer, Barnett, dismissed the accusations as the work of people in
search of money or publicity for their stories.</TE>
<TE>   Classmates of Jackson at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale
described him as a quiet, easygoing person who likes to dress well
and stays out of trouble. Most said they had no idea he had a mental
disability, but stressed that he was not a violent boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck no, he wouldn't hit an officer," said Arrin McDaniel, 15.</TE>
<TE>   Students described Jackson as active in school clubs, including
Ebony Nation, which promotes African American culture, history and
community service.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson had recently become one of the school's peer mediators,
said Tatiana Morgan, 16.</TE>
<TE>   Leuzinger High School officials would not say whether Jackson was
enrolled in special education classes, although Jackson's lawyer
showed a reporter a copy of a document that classified his
disability.</TE>
<TE>   John Minor, 17, of Hawthorne said he was enrolled in a regular
science and math class with Jackson in the 10th grade and tutored
Jackson during 20-minute periods their algebra teacher set aside
every Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He could sit and have a conversation with you, but as far as
learning he didn't catch on as quick as everyone else," Minor said.
"You'd talk to him and you tried to explain something and it would
take a while for him to understand. When I heard about what happened,
that's the first thing that came to my mind."</TE>

Angeles. Times staff writers Steve Berry, Anna Gorman, Carla Hall,

<HD>Inmate Didn't Get Life, So He Chose Death at 92</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OROVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Around the Butte County jail, he was known as Pops, the 92-year-old
gentleman in a baggy blue jumpsuit, old enough to be someone's
great-grandfather.</LD>
<LD>   For 426 days, guards and inmates made white-haired Coval Russell
comfortable: To ease his pains, they gave him an extra mattress, or
the first spot in chow line. Prisoners contributed their own precious
TV rights so he could watch the evening news. Guards let him make
outside calls to order ulcer pills.</LD>
<LD>   In his months behind bars for stabbing and wounding his
70-year-old landlord--his first encounter with the criminal justice
system--Russell found a jail community that oddly provided a respect
he rarely saw on the outside.</LD>
<TE>   That's why the lanky Oklahoma native petitioned the judge to let
him stay in jail for good. "They took care of me, treated me like I
was a human being," said Russell, who corrections officials believe
may have been California's oldest county jail inmate. "And I showed
them respect too."</TE>
<TE>   A judge last month denied the appeal, saying jail was not the
appropriate place for a man of Russell's age and health. In an
interview with a Times reporter last week, a distraught Russell said
his remaining options were to purposely violate his parole so he
could return to jail, or maybe even take his own life.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the World War II veteran jumped off a 40-foot bridge
into the Feather River near here, a friend confirmed. While Butte
County officials would not officially identify the body, Jim Pihl, a
Chico private investigator who had befriended Russell, said officers
called to confirm the death.</TE>
<TE>   "Russ," as he also liked to be called, "was very honest right up
to the end," said Pihl. "His exact words were that he was in 'an
untenable situation.' He tried to warn people he would do this."</TE>
<TE>   Since his jail release June 26, Russell, a lifelong bachelor who
outlived relatives and close friends alike, had spent his days a drab
Motel 6 in this rural gold country community, pondering his next
move.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had been denied assistance from the state's
conservatorship program because, while his body was failing, his mind
remained as sharp as in those Depression days when he prospected for
gold in the hills east of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Blind in one eye, suffering from prostate cancer and bearing a
saucer-sized scar on his forehead from surgery for melanoma, the
140-pound Russell called retirement homes the real jail cells.</TE>
<TE>   "My future holds nothing," he said. "At my age and my physical
condition, it's like being dead while you're still alive."</TE>
<TE>   Sprawled on his hotel bed, he added: "When a person reaches my
age, I believe they should legally be allowed to commit suicide. I'd
do it in a minute, if I could get somebody to help me."</TE>
<TE>   Pihl, hired by Russell as part of the defense for his assault case
but who later became his friend, said the old man called him Friday,
first asking him to help secure some pain medication and then
suggesting he needed help to commit suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he'd make it worth my while but I cut him off right
there," said Pihl, whose own elderly father recently committed
suicide after suffering from ill health.</TE>
<TE>   Pihl recalled the first time he met Russell in the jail visiting
room while investigating his assault case. "I was flabbergasted to
see this old gentleman through the plexiglass. He was articulate and
intelligent, but his body was failing him. Jail wasn't the place for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Russell himself never figured he'd see time behind bars. Born in
Old Cornish, Okla., in 1910--during the administration of President
William H. Taft--he spent 46 years in Los Angeles, working jobs from
liquor store clerk to contractor before retiring to Butte County in
1976. Without family to look after him, the solitary Russell lived
with various friends and strangers.</TE>
<TE>   A nonsmoker who rarely drank, Russell relished the weekly gambling
junkets to Reno he took for 22 years straight.</TE>
<TE>   But then his luck gave out. In April 2001, in what Russell called
"the biggest mistake of my life," he was arrested for stabbing his
landlord, who survived without serious injuries, at their Paradise,
Calif., home. Accounts of the incident differ, but Russell said the
two scuffled after the landlord ordered him from the home for not
keeping his room clean. In the ensuing brawl, Russell stabbed the man
with a four-inch knife he kept in his sweater pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Russell had a new identity: Butte County Jail inmate
#110865. He lived with a rough cast of characters--many of them 70
years his junior. "It scared the heck out of me," said the longtime
mystery novel fan. "The only thing I knew about jail I'd read in
books."</TE>
<TE>   At first, he was menaced by jail "tough guys," and began to carry
three sharpened pencils in his breast pocket as protection.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the unlikely: The jail rallied around Russell. Guards
and some of the lockup's 490 inmates--men doing time for misdemeanors
or awaiting trial for serious crimes, including murder--told the
thugs to back off.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers grew to like him," Butte County Sheriff Scott
Mackenzie said before Russell's death. "He became a grandfather
figure around the jail. Folks took him under their wing."</TE>
<TE>   As Russell's lawyer filed for repeated continuances in his case
just so he could remain in jail, officers never handcuffed him en
route to court. They called him by his first name and made sure he
got his four daily medications.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates felt sorry for the old man who preferred jail to a lonely
life outside. "We became his grandkids," said 42-year-old Albert
Morford, charged with drug possession. "We were a motley crew, but we
were family nonetheless."</TE>
<TE>   Then Russ got the boot from jail.</TE>
<TE>   His eyes watered as he described his send-off. Nearly everyone,
guards and inmates alike, came by his cell to shake his hand. The
prisoners in lockdown banged their cell doors in unison.</TE>
<TE>   On the outside, despite Pihl's help, Russell had been unable to
find a place to stay. He feared a residential care facility would
deplete his meager savings before government assistance kicked in.</TE>
<TE>   In his last days, he ate most meals at a diner near his motel and
flirted innocently with the waitresses. And he weighed his
options--including violating his probation as a way to return to
jail.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes me pretty sad to hear that," Sheriff Mackenzie had
said last week. "He deserves more than this."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent visit to his probation officer, Russell received a
slap on the back from a fellow jail inmate who'd also been released.</TE>
<TE>   That brought back the tears. "No matter what people might think of
jail," Russell said, "those men were my friends."</TE>
<TE>   On the morning he took his life, Russell visited the Motel 6
manager to pay his $41 for another night at the hotel. "He said he'd
be staying until Thursday or Friday," said manager Doris Woodward.
"Then he asked me to call him a cab. He was such a sweet old man."</TE>
<TE>   Pihl said Russell's death demonstrates how many elderly feel
discarded by society. "He just didn't feel like there was any room
left for him. His body betrayed him but his mind was so sharp. I know
he felt like he didn't have any other place to go."</TE>

<HD>Inglewood Force Doesn't Mirror City's Population</HD>
<DH>Police: Almost half the officers are white; the population
is largely black and Latino. Residents seem torn by the videotape.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In many respects, the Inglewood Police Department today resembles the
LAPD of the early 1980s: whiter than the community it serves,
responsible for an area beset by violent crime and under fire for the
conduct of its officers.</LD>
<LD>   Still 43% white in a city whose population is half black and half
Latino, Inglewood's 193-officer Police Department is typical of many
medium-sized agencies.</LD>
<LD>   Recruits get a little more than three-fourths of the training of
LAPD officers, but work amid similar crime patterns.</LD>
<TE>   They are young--nearly a third of them are rookies--and there
aren't enough; the force is authorized to have 210 officers.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Inglewood residents are at high risk of being
victimized by crime. Murder rates are triple the national average.</TE>
<TE>   Tone Williams, a 42-year-old black security guard, summed up the
paradox: He matter-of-factly spoke of police beatings, which he
believes are common, then twisted his neck to display a rippled,
6-inch scar, the result of an attack on the street. He credits police
with helping to save him in that incident, and says he supports the
department.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood has fielded an independent police department since the
early part of the last century.</TE>
<TE>   A fraction the size of the giant LAPD, today it is 43% white, 25%
black, 27% Latino and 4% Asian. Chief Ronald Banks is black, as are
one captain and at least one lieutenant.</TE>
<TE>   This is a change from years ago when the department was mostly
white, but Inglewood has changed more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Blacks were still a slim majority in 1990, but by the 2000 U.S.
Census, they had slipped to less than 47% of the population. Latinos
are 46%, whites less than 5%.</TE>
<TE>   After this week's wide broadcast of a videotape showing an
Inglewood officer slamming a teenager onto a car and punching him,
Police Department officials this week took pains to point out that of
the four officers seen on the videotape, one, Jeremy Morse, is white;
one is African American; one is Latino; and the fourth describes
himself as "other."</TE>
<TE>   "It was the United Nations out there," said Lt. Eve Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Morse was put on administrative leave Monday; the incident is
being investigated.</TE>
<TE>   The command structure in Inglewood is much simpler than that of
larger departments. The department is run by a chief, three captains,
nine lieutenants and 31 sergeants.</TE>
<TE>   In discipline as well, the department differs from larger
agencies. There is no civilian involvement, and recommendations for
punishment are made by supervisors rather than a review panel.</TE>
<TE>   The department receives about 50 public complaints a year, Irvine
said, resulting from about 50,000 contacts between officers and
residents. Another 50 or so internal complaints also are investigated
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the LAPD, Inglewood has no written list of punishments for
specific acts of misconduct. Instead, supervisors' discretion and
past practice are the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, only a handful of officers are suspended in any given
year, and terminations, though not unknown, are quite rare, Irvine
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the department expects all employees to encourage
citizens or fellow employees to bring complaints or reports of
employee misconduct, and failure to do so is a violation of policy,
Irvine said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the day the alleged brutality took place, Inglewood
officers at the scene filed a report that described the striking of
the teenager, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the LAPD requires its officers to immediately report
even possible misconduct, and imposes penalties, including
termination, for failure to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood officers receive 830 hours of training at various
academies, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Academy,
officials said. The state minimum is 664. The state average is about
1,000 hours, and LAPD officers receive 1,200.</TE>
<TE>   Officers face a crime environment similar to that in surrounding
Los Angeles County and Los Angeles city neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   However, Inglewood's 10 murders as of June represent a 30% decline
from last year--in sharp contrast to the rest of Los Angeles, where
murder is on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   Residents seemed torn between support for the department and
revulsion at what they saw on the tape.</TE>
<TE>   "My experience with police personally has been that they are very
attentive, responsive to problems," said restaurant owner Adolph
Dulan.</TE>
<TE>   But when he saw the tape, Dulan said, he "felt a sickness in the
pit of my stomach.</TE>
<TE>   "Like, 'Oh my God, here we go all over again.' "</TE>

<HD>Accusations Are Made About Officer in Previous Incidents</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Inglewood Police Officer Jeremy Morse has been accused of misconduct
in at least six other incidents aside from the videotaped beating of
a 16-year-old boy Saturday, according to residents and attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   In some instances the complaints are included in court files, and
in one case, the Inglewood Police Department acknowledges an ongoing
internal investigation.</LD>
<LD>   In others, residents say they have filed formal complaints or
complained informally to police about Morse's actions, but the
department will not comment on those allegations.</LD>
<TE>   John D. Barnett, Morse's attorney, said he is not surprised that
others are making accusations and seeking litigation after the
videotaped incident. "People file for money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Morse, 24, a three-year veteran of the department, was relieved of
duty Monday after the repeated broadcast of the videotape showing him
slamming Donovan Jackson against a police car and punching him in the
face.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Jackson and his father, Coby Chavis, filed a federal
lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles alleging civil rights violations in
the encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Ron Ragan, a spokesman for the Police Department,
acknowledged that Morse is under investigation for a separate
incident involving Neilson Williams, 32, of Inglewood, but he would
not confirm whether the department has received additional
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who counsels gang members for the organization Unity
One, filed a complaint with the department last month alleging that
Morse and several other officers beat him as he was leaving a picnic
at Ashwood Park in Inglewood on June 23.</TE>
<TE>   "They just basically beat me to a pulp," Williams said. "They
almost beat me to death."</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Saddie Johns, said Williams was not arrested or
cited in the incident. Johns said she plans to file a civil lawsuit
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Another federal civil rights lawsuit against Inglewood police was
filed Wednesday by attorneys for Roberto Francisco Willis, 31, and
Lance Elliot Eaton, 32, who were arrested by Morse.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that Morse and Officer Bijan Darvish struck them
during their arrests on drug charges Jan. 11 and that a supervisor
failed to do anything about it.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also alleges that Morse struck Willis in the mouth and
knocked out his two front teeth, and that Darvish struck Eaton twice
in the body.</TE>
<TE>   "The videotaped assault is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
this department and these officers," said Jorge Gonzalez, an attorney
for the men.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 11, Willis and Eaton were at a friend's apartment on
Lawrence Street about 9 p.m. when four officers knocked on the door
demanding entry and entered the apartment, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews Wednesday, both men said they were hit after being
handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Willis and Eaton complained to the watch commander about the
treatment, but no action was taken against the officers, according to
the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Both men pleaded no contest to drug possession charges.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez delivered a letter to Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn on
Wednesday alleging that the Police Department has an unwritten policy
that encourages the use of violence and asking the mayor to call for
federal charges against the officers.</TE>
<TE>   A public defender in a criminal case stemming from the same arrest
said he was given information from the city of Inglewood about two
other misconduct allegations against Morse.</TE>
<TE>   But the attorney provided no information other than the names of
those making the complaints and the dates of the incidents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, two other residents say they have informally
complained to police about Morse:</TE>
<TE>   * Akkilah Artiga, 22, of Inglewood said in an interview that she

<LD>   A teenager who survived a suicide pact that killed her husband was
sentenced to prison for her role in the rape of a teenage girl.</LD>
<TE>   In a Lansing courtroom, Circuit Judge Thomas Brown sentenced
Jennifer Holey, 19, to four to 15 years in prison, prosecutors said.
Holey had pleaded no contest to criminal sexual conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors accused Holey of helping in her husband's April 1 rape
of the 14-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Police asked to interview Jennifer and Patrick Holey about the
rape, and state child protection workers took their infant daughter,
leading them to plan their suicides, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   On April 9, the couple took painkillers allegedly supplied by
Patrick Holey's mother. Kathleen Holey, 43, faces charges of assisted
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Holey is due to give birth to her second child in August.
Her family is trying to win custody of that baby as well as her
daughter, now 11 months old.</TE>

<HD>Bush Got Loans Like Ones He Denounced</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As a Texas businessman, President Bush took two low-interest loans
from an oil company where he was a member of the board of directors,
engaging in a practice he condemned this week in his plan to stem
corporate abuse and accounting fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Bush accepted loans totaling $180,375 from Harken Energy Corp. in
1986 and 1988, according to Securities and Exchange Commission
filings. Bush was a director of Harken from 1986 to 1993, after he
sold his failed oil and gas exploration concern to the company. He
used the loans to buy Harken stock.</LD>
<LD>   Corporate loans to officers came under scrutiny after WorldCom
Inc., the long-distance carrier that last month reported huge
accounting irregularities, revealed it had lent nearly $400 million
to Bernard J. Ebbers to buy the company's stock when he was chief
executive. He resigned in April as the stock price tumbled.</LD>
<TE>   Bush attacked corporate loans during his speech on Wall Street on
Tuesday, when he offered proposals to tighten the accountability of
corporate executives while stopping short of the tougher measures
headed toward passage in the Senate. "I challenge compensation
committees to put an end to all company loans to corporate officers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   White House communications director Dan Bartlett said Harken
offered the loans to directors to buy shares in the company as part
of an incentive for board members "to have a long-term commitment
with the company." Bartlett said the loans to Bush were "totally
appropriate--there was no wrongdoing there."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a common practice in small, medium and large companies,"
Bartlett said. "These recent abuses of certain types of loans led the
president to believe that the government should draw a bright line
concerning loans going forward. This is one of the main things that
undermined the confidence of investors and shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Bartlett said the loans were for $96,000 in 1986, for 80,000
shares, and $84,375 in 1988, for 25,000 shares. He said that in 1993,
Harken changed its compensation policies and discontinued the loan
program. He said Harken converted to a program giving directors stock
options, allowing them to buy stock later at a fixed price.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Is Named in Suit Alleging Corporate Fraud</HD>
<DH>Court: Legal watchdog group says that the firm the vice
president headed engaged in illegal accounting practices. The charges
are denied.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One day after President Bush unveiled his latest effort to stem
corporate corruption, a legal watchdog group on Wednesday sued Vice
President Dick Cheney and the Texas-based oil services business he
once led, alleging fraudulent accounting practices by the company.</LD>
<LD>   The suit filed by Judicial Watch in U.S. District Court in Dallas
charges that Halliburton Co. overstated its revenue by $445 million
from 1999 to 2001, part of the period Cheney was chairman and chief
executive officer. The suit alleges the overstatements led to
shareholder losses. Named as defendants are Cheney, Halliburton's
board of directors and the Arthur Andersen accounting firm.</LD>
<LD>   The Halliburton accounting practices challenged by the suit also
are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Klayman, chairman and general counsel of Judicial Watch,
said the suit goes beyond the SEC investigation because it named the
vice president and would involve public disclosures, rather than
being conducted behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   Klayman said Cheney was listed as a defendant because, as chief
executive during the time targeted by the suit, "the buck stops with
him."</TE>
<TE>   Klayman added: "He's a meticulous manager. For them to make this
kind of accounting change, he had to approve it."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer dismissed the Judicial
Watch suit, filed on behalf of two Halliburton shareholders, as
"without merit." Cheney's spokeswoman, Jennifer Millerwise, said,
"It's a Halliburton issue."</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton's chief financial officer, Doug Foshee, called the
suit's claims "untrue, unsupported and unfounded."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Andersen, which has been tainted in the recent
spate of corporate scandals, said the company would decline to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the suit's legal elements lie political dimensions. By
filing its suit Wednesday, Judicial Watch renewed attention to the
Bush administration's close links to big business.</TE>
<TE>   Another reminder occurred Wednesday in the form of a 1996
promotional videotape that features Cheney praising the Andersen
company for its audit work. The Wall Street Journal obtained a copy
of the video, which can be viewed on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Cheney and six other executives applaud the
accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, once one of the country's most respected accounting
companies, was convicted earlier this year of obstruction of justice
by shredding documents that had to do with Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's financial collapse late last year after revelations that
it exaggerated profit to appeal to investors was the first of the
recent wave of corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   During the last week, Bush has faced renewed scrutiny about his
own past as a businessman. The questions have involved his sale of
stock in Harken Energy Corp. in 1990, shortly before the company, of
which he was a director, reported a sizable loss.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch has developed a gadfly reputation in recent years.
During the Clinton administration, it filed several lawsuits against
government officials. It's best-known suit sought access to White
House e-mails on such matters as the investigation of the Monica S.
Lewinsky scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton disclosed May 28 that the SEC was investigating the
company's accounting of cost overruns on construction jobs. Contracts
had allowed Halliburton to negotiate or sue for additional payment if
such cost overruns ate into its profits.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the company changed its accounting procedures and began
listing those disputed claims as revenue, even though the clients had
not agreed to pay them.</TE>
<TE>   Foshee said that Halliburton was working with the SEC to resolve
questions regarding the procedures, and that the company has followed
SEC guidelines and generally accepted accounting principles.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney was Halliburton's top executive when Bush selected him as
his running mate in 2000. He received a retirement stock package
variously valued at from $20 million to almost $34 million.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch's suit follows several others filed on behalf of
shareholders allegedly defrauded by Halliburton's accounting
practices, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   At least five securities-fraud suits seeking class-action status
for all Halliburton shareholders have been filed, including one June
3 by Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach, the best-known of the
"strike suit" firms that accuse executives and public corporations of
releasing false or misleading information.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Scott Reckard in Los Angeles and Associated
Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>   "There's a dark side to his being, and I don't see any meaningful
prospect of that being erased," Richter said in handing down the
sentence.</LD>

<HD>House Takes Up Bush Security Plan</HD>
<DH>Congress: Struggle with White House looms as panels debate
homeland defense reorganization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress began slicing up President Bush's plan for a new homeland
security agency Wednesday, with many lawmakers breaking sharply from
the administration vision for immigration services, emergency
response management and other significant elements of the proposed
Cabinet department.</LD>
<LD>   Votes in several House committees, though preliminary, gave a
clear view of the intense legislative struggle unfolding as Capitol
Hill grapples with one of the broadest government reorganization
proposals in half a century.</LD>
<LD>   For example, Bush's GOP allies on the House Judiciary Committee
strayed from his proposal for a new Department of Homeland Security
in legislation the committee endorsed on a bipartisan voice vote.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than drawing the entire Immigration and Naturalization
Service into the department, as Bush seeks, the committee would
divide it--handing the job of enforcing immigration laws to Homeland
Security but leaving the delivery of immigration services, such as
permanent residency applications, to the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the committee plan would move the Secret Service, which has
elite anti-terrorism units, from the Treasury Department to Justice,
even though Bush wants it in Homeland Security. Also, the committee
would leave most of the Federal Emergency Management Agency out of
the new department, contrary to the Bush plan.</TE>
<TE>   The committee chairman, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.),
said the proposal he sponsored with Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.)
would ensure that the government overhauls a long-dysfunctional
immigration agency. Earlier this year, the House overwhelmingly
approved an INS reform bill that also would split the agency in a
similar way.</TE>
<TE>   "INS service problems are legendary," he said. "And it is critical
to ensure that immigration services are no longer sacrificed in favor
of enforcement priorities."</TE>
<TE>   Sensenbrenner added that he did not want the role of immigration
services to be "subsumed by the massive size and scope of the new
department."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, meantime, resumed his push for a new Cabinet-level domestic
security department that would oversee nearly 170,000 employees drawn
from 22 agencies now scattered throughout the executive branch.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to federal employees in Washington, Bush said: "All of
you are in agencies that have got more than one priority, but the
single most important priority is to protect the homeland now in
America. We're at war."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech came just more than a month after he unveiled his
idea for the Homeland Security Department, a move he initially
resisted immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Congress is scrutinizing Bush's proposal in detail,
lawmakers from both parties are angling to amend it. On Wednesday,
five House committees--Judiciary, Science, International Relations,
Ways and Means, and Armed Services--approved their versions.</TE>
<TE>   Today, several more panels will take up the plan. House leaders
hope to hammer committee ideas into a final bill for a floor debate
by the end of the month. The Senate also plans to take up the issue
before it breaks for the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Some House committees, such as Armed Services, are merely
fine-tuning the Bush proposal. But the Science Committee approved a
version that would block Bush's proposal to move a computer security
unit to Homeland Security from the Commerce Department. Ways and
Means approved a plan that would allow Treasury to continue oversight
of major portions of the Customs Service, even as that agency moves
to Homeland Security. Bush seeks a simple transfer of Customs from
one department to the other.</TE>
<TE>   The administration managed to defend its proposal in one key
arena: the issuance of visas to foreign visitors. Under the Bush
plan, Homeland Security would oversee policy and regulations on
visas, but the State Department would retain control of the consular
offices around the world that grant them.</TE>
<TE>   That arrangement has come under fire from lawmakers who believe
the State Department has failed to keep would-be terrorists out of
the country. But the International Relations Committee brokered a
deal that would essentially preserve the Bush plan while allowing
Homeland Security to send agents overseas to bolster safeguards in
the visa-issuing system.</TE>
<TE>   Other panels may weigh in today with major changes. Leaders of the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, for example, are
skeptical of plans to transfer the Coast Guard from the
Transportation Department to Homeland Security. And Rep. Doug Ose
(R-Sacramento) on the Government Reform Committee wants to keep the
Secret Service in Treasury.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Democrat Reps. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles and
David R. Obey of Wisconsin sent the White House a 30-page letter that
questions many portions of the Bush plan.</TE>
<TE>   The two, writing to Homeland Security advisor Tom Ridge, faulted
the administration for failing to consult with relevant agencies
before announcing its plan June 6. "It is being rushed through
Congress on an accelerated schedule," Waxman and Obey wrote. "This is
not normally an approach that produces sound policy."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Waxman disclosed that the Congressional Budget Office
estimates start-up costs for the department to be about $3
billion--contradicting administration predictions of no new net
costs.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Elizabeth A. Smart's father said Wednesday he received a letter that
he suspects may have come from someone with knowledge of his
14-year-old daughter's disappearance.</LD>
<LD>   But Ed Smart said he couldn't say whether the letter, which was
postmarked July 3 and received Tuesday, was credible. Smart said the
letter lacked solid information that it came from a person with
specific knowledge about his daughter but was the first that seemed
to be from someone willing to negotiate.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just anxious to do whatever it's going to take to get her
back," Smart said at a news conference.</LD>
<TE>   Smart said police received a copy of the typewritten, unsigned
letter by fax before he received a copy in the mail. He declined to
say where it was postmarked.</TE>
<TE>   But Salt Lake City police Capt. Scott Atkinson said Wednesday the
letter was never faxed but that Smart gave them a copy after telling
reporters about it.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Elizabeth was abducted from her bedroom at gunpoint
June 5.</TE>

<HD>House Strongly Backs Arming of Pilots in Airline Cockpits</HD>
<DH>Weapons: The bill's Senate odds are slim, with the airline
industry and Bush administration opposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Airline pilots with semiautomatic pistols would be able to defend the
cockpit against terrorist attack under legislation passed
overwhelmingly by the House on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But prospects that the bill will become law remained uncertain
because of opposition from the airline industry, concerns at the
Transportation Department and skepticism in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The House vote was 310-113, but in the Senate, Commerce Committee
Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) remains steadfastly opposed,
said his spokesman, Andy Davis.</LD>
<TE>   ''Where this goes from here is hard to tell,'' said Davis. ''The
White House doesn't support it. The Transportation Department doesn't
support it."</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's House debate, lawmakers rejected a compromise
that would have limited the program to 1,400 volunteer ''federal
flight deck officers" over a two-year test period. Instead, by a vote
of 250-175, they approved an amendment by Rep. Peter A. DeFazio
(D-Ore.) to make the program permanent and open it to any pilot
volunteer qualified to undergo training.</TE>
<TE>   The House vote was a clear victory for pilot unions, which lobbied
hard for legislation that would allow their members to carry guns.
That military jets can now bring down hijacked civilian airliners
proved to be a convincing argument for arming pilots.</TE>
<TE>   ''Today, armed F-16s are prepared to shoot down any commercial jet
that is hijacked by terrorists," said House Transportation Committee
Chairman Don Young (R-Alaska). ''Under these new circumstances, we
must allow trained and qualified pilots to serve as the last line of
defense."</TE>
<TE>   But the airlines fear that giving pilots guns could lead to
accidental shootings and lawsuits from passengers. The flight
attendant union also opposes arming pilots, worried that its members
could become unintended victims in a high-altitude shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Some airlines are advocating stun guns as an alternative to
bullets. United Airlines has purchased more than 1,300 of the devices
and has begun training its pilots. But the Transportation Security
Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration do not appear
to be close to deciding on whether to permit their use.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon,
the government and the airlines took steps to reinforce cockpit
doors. Temporary metal bars were installed, and the doors themselves
are being replaced with ones designed to be bulletproof. Senate
supporters of arming pilots, frustrated by Hollings' opposition, said
the House vote will help their legislation. They are looking for
another bill to attach it to on the Senate floor.</TE>
<TE>   The House action ''demonstrates that the best way to fight
terrorism is not with toys but with handguns," said Eric Bovim, a
spokesman for Sen. Conrad R. Burns (R-Mont.). ''This sends a message
to the Senate and to the administration."</TE>
<TE>   Burns, a conservative, won an unlikely ally Wednesday when Sen.
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) endorsed the Senate version of the bill. A
leading liberal, Boxer found herself in the company of Burns and Sen.
Bob Smith (R-N.H.), another conservative.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think this is the first time I have ever stood with Sen. Smith
on an issue that has involved guns," Boxer said. ''However, I have
decided that until I am satisfied with the number of air marshals on
commercial flights, this bill ... is a matter of life and death."</TE>
<TE>   The number of air marshals is classified, but it has been greatly
increased from the 32 who were available on Sept. 11--all assigned to
international flights. Experts estimate that it would take about
120,000 marshals to cover every flight, at an estimated cost of more
than $10 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that marshals can only protect a small proportion of
flights is one of the main arguments for training and arming pilots,
said Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), one of the authors of the House
bill. Mica said the pilots would not be allowed to leave the cockpit
and engage attackers in the passenger cabin. Instead, their weapons
could be used solely to repel an attack on the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   In the aviation security bill passed last year, Congress
authorized the arming of pilots but left the decision to the
Transportation Department. After considering the issue, department
officials decided that the potential risks outweighed the possible
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   If the House bill becomes law, it's unclear how quickly its
provisions could be carried out.</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues to be resolved is how to pay for the pilot
training. Congressional analysts had estimated that a limited program
for 1,400 pilots would cost $47 million over five years, but there is
no estimate for an open-ended program such as the House approved.
Also unclear is whether the airlines would challenge the
congressional mandate as an unwarranted intrusion into their
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   ''This legislation has a fatal flaw: We don't give the airlines a
choice on whether their employees can carry guns on their planes,"
said Rep. Vernon J. Ehlers (R-Mich.). ''The federal government should
not mandate that a reluctant airline should allow a pilot to carry a
gun. I am not aware of any instance where the federal government has
told employees they can carry guns to work."</TE>

<HD>Senate Backs Stiffer Fraud Penalties</HD>
<DH>Business: Democrats, GOP unite on measures that would make
it easier to prosecute violators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate unanimously agreed Wednesday to new measures that would
make it easier to prosecute corporate fraud and would stiffen the
penalties for such crimes, a clear sign of the bipartisan stampede to
crack down on corporate wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The measures were approved as amendments to a Democratic-backed
accounting reform bill that gained momentum Wednesday as the White
House sent its strongest signal yet that it is willing to accept the
legislation. The overall bill is expected to win final Senate
approval, perhaps by the end of the week.</LD>
<LD>   The votes on the amendments came the day after President Bush
delivered a speech to Wall Street that was widely panned as a weak
response to the string of corporate accounting scandals that have
cost investors billions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats who control the Senate sought to show their
aggressiveness on the issue, pushing for the changes in the bill that
go significantly beyond what Bush proposed.</TE>
<TE>   One amendment would make securities fraud a federal crime.
Currently, prosecutors must rely on laws that are not specifically
written for securities fraud, such as mail and wire fraud. The
amendment's advocates said that makes the cases more complex, and
that creating a felony specifically for securities fraud would make
it easier to prosecute corporate misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment also would provide new protections for corporate
whistle-blowers and extend the time for investors to bring securities
fraud lawsuits against corporations, among other measures.</TE>
<TE>   The other amendment would treat corporate criminals the same as
drug kingpins, subjecting them to prison terms of up to 10 years.
Currently, the punishment for corporate wrongdoing in many cases is
not as severe as for other crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "These people deserve to go to jail," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.), a leading supporter of both measures. "They've ruined the
lives of thousands of people, good people, hard-working people,
honest people. They have destroyed much of the confidence in Wall
Street."</TE>
<TE>   Every Republican present joined Democrats in voting for both
measures, demonstrating the political potency of the issue as
corporate scandals have shaken financial markets and loom as a
political issue in the fall campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The unanimity for the tougher penalties makes it virtually certain
that the entire bill will pass by a large margin, increasing the
pressure on Bush and congressional Republicans to accept new
regulations that some GOP lawmakers have resisted as excessive.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time Republicans vote unanimously with a Democratic proposal,
it tells you they know which way the political wind is blowing," said
Robert Litan, economic studies director for the nonpartisan Brookings
Institution in Washington. "They don't want to stand in the way of a
hurricane come November."</TE>
<TE>   The GOP-controlled House earlier this year passed an accounting
reform bill that Democrats have criticized as not tough enough.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate on Wednesday also voted--again unanimously--to
incorporate into its accounting reform bill a number of the proposals
Bush made Tuesday for cracking down on corporate corruption.</TE>
<TE>   These include doubling the maximum prison term, to 10 years, for
mail and wire fraud convictions in securities fraud cases; granting
the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to bar dishonest
corporate officials from serving as officers and directors of public
companies; and strengthening laws that criminalize document shredding
and other forms of obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Bush's speech and in the face of the strong push
for the Senate Democrats' accounting bill, Republicans scrambled to
grab a share of the political credit for the burgeoning effort to
combat corporate malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans downplayed past GOP reservations about the Senate bill
drafted by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.).</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with Bush, Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) said the president "didn't see any major problems" with the
Sarbanes bill.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush told
congressional leaders over breakfast Wednesday that he believes the
House and Senate bills are actually "very close."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said key differences between them are "all bridgeable."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "From the president's point of view, there is about 95%
agreement between the administration and Congress on the various
pieces of legislation."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not that far apart," said Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio),
lead sponsor of the version of the House accounting bill. Democrats
have derided the measure as weak, largely because it would not give a
new oversight accounting board as much authority as in a provision in
the Senate bill.</TE>
<TE>   Some House Republicans are showing signs of giving ground on
another hot anti-corporate issue: measures to crack down on companies
that move their legal address to tax havens like Bermuda to avoid
U.S. taxes. House GOP leaders have steadfastly opposed legislation by
Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) to bar such corporate relocations.</TE>
<TE>   The House Appropriations Committee voted Tuesday to approve an
amendment to a Treasury-Post Office funding bill to cut off federal
contracts from those agencies to companies that move offshore to
avoid taxes.</TE>

<HD>Giuliani, Wife Reach Divorce Settlement</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his estranged wife, Donna
Hanover, narrowly averted an ugly, public battle in divorce court
Wednesday, ending their 16-year marriage with a last-minute,
out-of-court settlement worth $6.8 million for Hanover.</LD>
<LD>   "This is both a very sad day and a day in which I feel a great
sense of relief," Giuliani said after four hours of negotiations
behind closed doors at the courthouse to conclude the settlement.
"For the sake of the children and really all of us, I'm relieved we
were able to reach an agreement on all the different terms and spare
everyone any further embarrassment."</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani admitted to cruel and inhuman treatment of Hanover based
on his open relationship with his girlfriend, Judith Nathan, said
Hanover's lawyer Helene Brezinsky.</LD>
<TE>   He will pay her $6.8 million in addition to legal expenses and
ongoing child support.</TE>
<TE>   The details of the settlement are secret, but court documents
released last month show that Giuliani was ordered to pay about
$22,000 a month to support Hanover and their two children. Hanover,
an actress and television personality, earns about $200,000 a year.
After the former mayor revealed he would earn about $8 million this
year in speaking fees on top of a $2.7-million book contract, Hanover
had asked for $1 million a year, including $1,140 a month for their
golden retriever, Goalie. (The former seeing-eye dog is going blind
and needs an operation.)</TE>
<TE>   "This is a spectacular win for Donna and her children," Brezinsky
said.</TE>
<TE>   The divorce process ended the same way it began: in front of the
media. Two years ago, Giuliani told a news conference that he wanted
to end their marriage--before he told Hanover. A year later, he
described how Hanover left him to struggle with his prostate cancer
alone, forcing him to clean up after himself when he spent the whole
night awake and vomiting after chemotherapy treatments. Giuliani, 58,
claimed that his companion, Nathan, was nothing more than a "good
friend," because the testosterone-suppressing cancer drugs had left
him impotent for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Hanover, 52, had complained of "open and notorious adultery" after
Giuliani began appearing with Nathan on his arm at public functions.
She accused him of having an earlier affair with his former press
secretary, Cristyne Lategano--a relationship Lategano has denied.</TE>
<TE>   A trial would have aired even more secrets. Giuliani, a tenacious
former prosecutor who hated to lose a case, said there were at least
a few details he wanted to keep private.</TE>

<HD>Screening Plan for Airport Baggage Is Seen as Wasteful</HD>
<DH>Security: The Dec. 31 deadline for the system will result
in the use of subpar technology at a cost of billions, a think tank
report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government's effort to bolster the security of airline baggage
risks wasting billions of dollars on subpar technology because of a
rush to complete the project this year, a report to be released today
concludes.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Congress and the Bush administration should set a more
realistic goal of December 2004 for screening 1 billion checked bags
a year for hidden bombs and appoint a special scientific board to
guide the program, the Los Angeles-based Reason Foundation
recommended.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the libertarian think tank crystallizes mounting
concerns among security experts, airport and airline executives, and
some government officials.</LD>
<TE>   The foundation estimated that the new Transportation Security
Administration will spend $3 billion to $12 billion attempting to
meet a Dec. 31 congressional deadline for screening checked bags with
some combination of machines to detect explosives. Existing
technologies have drawbacks, ranging from high false alarm rates to
frequent breakdowns to time-consuming requirements for opening a
large proportion of bags.</TE>
<TE>   "The forthcoming Cabinet agency for homeland security will have an
initial budget of $37 billion to deal with the entire range of
security threats--to buildings, water supply, power plants,
population. It seems hugely out of proportion to be spending up to
$12 billion on airline baggage inspection, when the full scope of
security threats is so enormous," said the report.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the House aviation
subcommittee, said he plans to hold a hearing shortly on the issues
raised by the Reason Foundation study. The report concludes that the
congressional deadline cannot be met because of a variety of
problems, including not enough time to procure thousands of machines.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Department officials insist they will fulfill the
congressional timetable, unless lawmakers amend it. "If Congress
wants to change its mind, that's fine," Transportation Secretary
Norman Y. Mineta said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   The report also urged the government to shift the focus of
aviation security from bags to people. That would involve making more
extensive use of computerized profiling to identify people who may
pose a threat, as well as creating a "trusted traveler" program to
exempt those who fly often from added searches. Computerized
profiling is already in use, and the government is conducting
research into ways of expanding it.</TE>
<TE>   To meet the bag-screening deadline, the security agency plans to
deploy 1,100 computerized tomography scanners, which generate
three-dimensional images of objects inside closed bags. The scanners
will be supplemented with 4,700 trace-detection systems, which can
pick up residue left by explosives on the outside of closed bags or
amid the contents of open ones. Millions of checked bags will have to
be opened to ensure the effectiveness of the trace systems, officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines are warning that it is foolhardy to attempt to achieve
such a difficult goal during the peak holiday travel season at the
end of the year. The Reason Foundation urged Congress to create a
scientific advisory panel to guide the design of a better system for
screening bags.</TE>
<TE>   "Checked baggage screening is a semi-disaster, because you don't
have the equipment," Mica said. "Some of the deadlines Congress put
in place were not realistic in the first place."</TE>

<HD>Retired Priest Pleads Not Guilty to Abuse</HD>
<DH>Courts: Paul Shanley, who is central to the Roman Catholic
Church sex abuse scandal, pleads not guilty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Retired priest Paul Shanley, a key figure in the sexual abuse scandal
that has swept the Roman Catholic Church, pleaded not guilty
Wednesday to 16 counts of child rape and assault.</LD>
<LD>   Ignoring the stares of some of his alleged victims' relatives,
Shanley declared himself "not guilty" of charges that he molested
four boys ages 6 to 15 from 1979 to 1989. The incidents allegedly
occurred in a church and rectory in suburban Newton.</LD>
<LD>   The 71-year-old Shanley, once a celebrated "street priest" who
ministered to marginalized populations, was arrested May 2 in San
Diego and extradited to Massachusetts.</LD>
<TE>   He is being held on $300,000 bail. A tentative trial date was set
for Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Graphic descriptions of the disgraced priest's alleged assaults,
as well as reports of his advocacy of "man-boy love," vaulted Shanley
to the center of the clerical abuse scandal that arose in January.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 250 priests have been removed from their positions or have
resigned since then, following accusations of child molestation that
in some cases date back 40 years. Four bishops also have stepped down
as top-ranking church officials have come under fire for failing to
take action against pedophile priests.</TE>
<TE>   In court Wednesday, the parents of Gregory Ford, one of Shanley's
alleged victims, faced off with their former parish priest for the
first time since their son reported his accusations to them. He
claims he was 6 when Shanley began abusing him, and that he suffered
through a troubled adolescence that included at least one suicide
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "How would any father feel, looking at the man that sent your
family to hell?" asked Rodney Ford, a campus policeman at a Boston
college.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Ford, 24, is one of the four alleged victims in the
criminal case against Shanley. He is also a plaintiff in a civil suit
against the archdiocese. He was not in court Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Arthur Austin, a 54-year-old artist who claims he was sexually
abused by Shanley for six years beginning in 1968, said he felt
compelled to be in court to see Shanley for the first time in
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "It is all still there," Austin said. "All the arrogance is still
there. All the power. All the certainty. I know that kind of
centered, calm look."</TE>
<TE>   Austin was the first of Shanley's alleged victims in Boston to go
public with accusations, claiming that he went to Shanley for
counseling and was sexually assaulted instead. The statute of
limitations barred him from bringing charges.</TE>
<TE>   Austin said he welcomed judicial intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm living in a world where I can walk into a courtroom and see
the wheels of justice turning, which is more than I could have done a
year ago," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Lawman Is Guilty in Death of Successor</HD>
<DH>Crime: The former sheriff of De Kalb County, Ga., is
convicted of first-degree murder for plotting killing. He is to be
sentenced to life in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, Ga.</DL>
<LD>A former Georgia sheriff was convicted Wednesday of ordering the
assassination of his political nemesis, a reform-minded lawman gunned
down on his own driveway three days before he was to take office.</LD>
<LD>   Sidney Dorsey was found guilty of first-degree murder in the
brazen slaying of Sheriff-elect Derwin Brown in suburban Atlanta in
December 2000. From day one, Dorsey had been the prime suspect,
although prosecutors struggled to build a case against him, saying he
used his status and police know-how to thwart them.</LD>
<LD>   As the verdicts were read, Brown's widow, Phyllis, sobbed so hard
she fell to the courtroom floor. As Dorsey was led away, her family
collapsed around her.</LD>
<TE>   "Derwin, Derwin, I can face you now," she cried. "I can face you."</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey didn't blink. He didn't say anything.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long slide down for Dorsey, 62, who had been
celebrated as the first black sheriff of De Kalb County. He will be
sentenced to life in prison for the murder because the prosecution
did not seek the death penalty. He also was convicted of 11
corruption-related charges, including bribery, theft and violation of
his oath. His attorneys have vowed to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel horrible," defense lawyer Brian Steel said. "An innocent
man is going to jail."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors ultimately turned to a man they believed had conspired
with Dorsey, offering immunity in exchange for his dramatic
testimony. In the end, though, at least one juror said that witness
didn't matter as much as their belief that Dorsey had a strong motive
to kill Brown.</TE>
<TE>   The monthlong trial had all the classic themes of greed, hubris,
betrayal and temptation. It was a tale, the way prosecutors told it,
of absolute power corrupting absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey started out as a poor kid in New York, taking a train to
Georgia by himself. He cleaned toilets for school fees, joined the
Army, put himself through college and law school while working as a
cop and then, in middle age, found himself at the peak of the area's
law enforcement pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, he killed two men--one in the line of duty in 1965,
another during a fistfight at a gas station in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Both times, he was cleared of any wrongdoing, though prosecutors
in the Brown case suggested afterward that those two killings
emboldened him.</TE>
<TE>   "He had gotten so arrogant," lead prosecutor J. Tom Morgan said.
"He actually thought he could get away with killing Derwin even
though he knew he would be the prime suspect."</TE>
<TE>   As sheriff of De Kalb County, he was in charge of a 3,700-bed
jail, a $50-million budget and 750 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Dorsey ran the department like an extension of
his ego: making deputies run personal errands and work for his
private security business, forcing women to have sex with him,
demanding bribes.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2000, Brown challenged Dorsey with a simple
pledge: I won't be sleazy.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 46, and also black, was playing off the fact that every De
Kalb County sheriff since 1964 had been investigated, indicted or
imprisoned. That included Dorsey, who was under investigation
concerning the theft of jail resources.</TE>
<TE>   Brown trounced Dorsey in a runoff election. He was set to take the
role of sheriff when he pulled up to his house Dec. 15, 2000, and
stepped out with an armload of Christmas presents and roses for his
wife. That's when someone popped out of the bushes and shot him 12
times.</TE>
<TE>   For months, authorities didn't have anything to go on, save a
handful of 9-millimeter shells. Morgan, a third-term district
attorney, was criticized for a lackluster investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But the big break came in November, when authorities convinced two
men that they suspected were involved with the murder to testify
against Dorsey. They granted them immunity. The lead witness would be
Patrick Cuffy, a former protege of Dorsey who helped plan the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   The immunity gamble initially didn't pay off. Authorities believe
that Dorsey hired four men to kill Brown and in March, two other
suspects, including alleged triggerman Melvin Walker, were sent to
trial. Both were acquitted. Jurors said they thought Cuffy was lying.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Cuffy was more polished. Without missing a beat, he
told a story of Dorsey handing him a note that said, "Kill Derwin
Brown." Dorsey wanted Brown out of the way so he could run again for
sheriff, Cuffy said.</TE>
<TE>   "My mission was to follow through with what Mr. Dorsey asked,"
Cuffy said, "and that was to kill Derwin Brown."</TE>
<TE>   But at least one juror said it wasn't Cuffy's testimony that
swayed the panel.</TE>
<TE>   After the judge thanked them, the lone man among a panel of women
ambled out of the jury box and into the arms of Brown's mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Just want to tell y'all I'm sorry," juror Willie Hayes said as he
hugged her.</TE>
<TE>   While Brown's family listened raptly, Hayes, a 64-year-old
probation officer, explained what happened during the two days of
deliberations. He said a lot of people didn't believe Cuffy. He said
the jurors were troubled by the immunity deals.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, the case was about power--and what one man would
do to keep it.</TE>
<TE>   "Dorsey played God," Hayes said. "And you can't play God."</TE>
<TE>   "Amen," said Brown's mother, Burvena, wringing Hayes' hand like a
handkerchief. "Amen."</TE>

<HD>Fossil Find Offers New Glimpse Into Ancient Human Ancestry</HD>
<DH>Anthropology: Bones are over 6 million years old--3 million
years older than any hominid skull before.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skull bones of the earliest known ancestor of humankind have emerged
from the swirling sand dunes of Chad--fossils more than 6 million
years old that will revolutionize the scientific understanding of
human beginnings, researchers announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The nearly complete cranium, fractured jaw bones and teeth-- 3
million years older than any other hominid skull discovered to
date--offer experts the first glimpse of a mysterious period of
evolution between 6 million and 7 million years ago when the earliest
ancestors of humans first branched off from chimpanzees, gorillas and
other great apes.</LD>
<LD>   As the first and only tangible evidence of hominids from such an
important period, the new fossils illuminate that crucial epoch like
a single candle burning in the dark basement of time.</LD>
<TE>   "Unquestionably, this is one of the most important fossil
discoveries of the last 100 years," Harvard University anthropologist
Daniel Lieberman said. "It is the oldest skull by far of a human
ancestor. This will have the scientific impact of a small nuclear
bomb."</TE>
<TE>   Details of the find were announced Wednesday in Chad and published
today in the British research journal Nature.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery suggests that human roots go deeper than previously
thought, said experts in England, Japan and the United States who
have examined the fossils. The first pre-humans may have branched off
from the ancestors of chimps and other apes a million years earlier
than genetic evidence of molecular DNA has hinted.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the closest we have gotten to the last common ancestor"
between humans and their closest modern relative, chimpanzees, said
UC Berkeley anthropologist Tim D. White.</TE>
<TE>   The teeth, brain case and facial features also appear "incredibly
modern," suggesting that this diminutive lakeshore dweller easily
could be a direct ancestor of contemporary humanity. It is evidence
that the earliest human ancestors bore little resemblance to any
modern ape.</TE>
<TE>   And because the fossils were found so far from the East African
Rift Valley, long considered to be the cradle of humanity, scientists
conclude that these primitive hominids, as the early ancestors of
humanity are called, ranged more widely than researchers expected.</TE>
<TE>   "It is of tremendous significance for its age, its completeness,
the location where it was found and its fascinating combination of
features," said Harvard's David Pilbeam, an authority on human
beginnings and a member of the research team. "It is a stunning
find."</TE>
<TE>   The fossil fragments from the newly named species were unearthed
last July in the scorching Djurab desert of Chad in Central Africa by
the Mission Paleoanthropologique Franco-Tchadienne, a team of 40
researchers from 10 countries led by French paleontologist Michel
Brunet at the University of Poitiers, who has explored the region for
30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of emotion to have in my hand the beginning of the
human lineage," Brunet said in a statement in Chad. "I have been
looking for this for so long."</TE>
<TE>   The cranium was spotted protruding from the crumbling sandstone by
Ahounta Djimdoumalbaye, a student at the University of N'Djamena in
the Chad capital.</TE>
<TE>   The remains belonged to small-brained creatures not much taller
than a chimp that was neither ape nor completely human. They lived
long before the first tools were made or fire was mastered.</TE>
<TE>   The newly discovered species "shows a mix of primitive and evolved
characteristics never seen before and that are surprising to see 6
million years ago," said paleontologist Chris Stringer at the Natural
History Museum in London. "It had an apelike brain size and skull
shape, combined with a more human-like face and teeth. Its discovery
shows how much evidence has been missing up to now."</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the combination of features appears so unusual
that the French researchers assigned the creatures to a new genus and
species called Sahelanthropus tchadensis. Brunet and his colleagues
dubbed the hominid find "Toumai," after a word in the local Goran
language meaning "hope of life" that traditionally is given as a
nickname to children born in the dry season.</TE>
<TE>   The bits and pieces discovered so far represent the remains of
five individuals, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing of the torso or limbs has been found, so researchers have
no idea how they walked, used their arms or how erectly they stood.
Brunet concluded that Toumai did walk upright because the hole for
the spinal cord at the skull's base resembles those found in hominids
known to be bipedal.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest evidence for the link to humanity are the teeth,
experts said. Only three have been discovered to date. They reveal
the blunt canine incisors and thickened dental enamel associated with
more highly evolved hominid species that did not appear until
millions of years later.</TE>
<TE>   The cranium's heavy brow ridges--the token of a species in which
males compete fiercely for the attention of females--are a feature
not seen in hominids except in the genus Homo, to which humans
belong, said Harvard's Pilbeam, who has examined the fossils. The
cranium, therefore, may have belonged to a male.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, "it plays havoc with the tidy model of human origins,"
said Bernard Woods of George Washington University, who is an expert
on human origins.</TE>
<TE>   The striking combination of features could mean the creatures
represent a small sample of a huge and hitherto unsuspected diversity
of ancient hominids, Woods said. The popular image of a neat line to
humans from a common ancestor with chimps may be misleading.</TE>
<TE>   The excavation site is an ancient lake bed a thousand miles from
the East African areas where almost all other early hominid
discoveries have been made.</TE>
<TE>   There, layers of time have been stripped by the wind to reveal a
broad but shallow band of fossil-bearing rock that appears to date
from 6 million to 7 million years ago. All of the hominid bone
fragments found so far turned up in a single sandy patch of earth
measuring about 600 square yards.</TE>
<TE>   The flat hardscrabble desert in which Brunet and his colleagues
work today, raked by the hot breath of the Sahara and the Sahel, is a
stark contrast to the lush landscape of marshes, rivulets and wooded
meadows where Toumai lived and died so many millions of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Lake Chad was an inland sea almost the size of
France that alternately rose and fell with cycles of climate change.
Its shores were home to a rich variety of grazing animals, and its
waters teemed with prehistoric hippos and crocodiles.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the evidence of fossil animal bones found with the Toumai
remains, Patrick Vignaud at the University of Poitiers in France and
his colleagues estimated the age of the Toumai find as 6 million to 7
million years. They readily acknowledged that using the evidence of
biology to date the site is not completely reliable. More absolute
dating requires techniques that use radioactive decay to gauge the
passage of time, and the rocks of the region do not contain the
proper isotopes.</TE>
<TE>   The dating of the Toumai find is important because, relying on
genetic evidence, scientists have assumed that the ancestors of
chimpanzees and humans split into separate evolution branches around
5 million years ago. If Vignaud's work holds up, scientists will have
to push that divide farther back in time.</TE>
<TE>   Several independent experts said they did not doubt the antiquity
of the find but expected the "loose" dating estimates will be revised
as better data become available. "So only time will tell where in the
circa six- to seven-million-year time period the Chad remains
actually fit," said anthropologist Gen Suwa at the University of
Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the fossils pose far more questions than they can answer.</TE>
<TE>   No one is sure just where they belong in the line of human
evolution. Do these bones belong to the sole pre-human species alive
in this early era or just one of many? Are the fossils an
evolutionary dead-end or the forefather of us all? How completely
will the first chapters of the human story have to be rewritten?</TE>
<TE>   Researchers will literally have to dig harder for answers in the
hope that Africa will yield more fossils.</TE>
<TE>   The Chad site has "enormous potential" for more important finds,
UC Berkeley's White said. "Whether that potential is realized depends
on the movement of the dunes, the glint of the sun and the skill of
the people working the site."</TE>

<HD>Hard Look at Risks of Hormones</HD>
<DH>Health: Doctors report post-menopausal women are 'scared'
as they face choices after study's halt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL and LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alicia Goldstein has been on hormone replacement therapy for a year
and half now--and loves the way her daily regimen deftly dealt with
her severe night sweats, hot flashes and insomnia.</LD>
<LD>   But now the 54-year-old Oakland resident is scared. Could the same
hormones that have steadied her life now do her harm?</LD>
<LD>   "Right now," she said, "I just don't know what to do."</LD>
<TE>   Women and their doctors are reeling after Tuesday's stunning
announcement that a major federal study of hormone replacement
therapy was halted early because the treatment conferred more harm,
not less, to post-menopausal women. Now, they face difficult
decisions: Should women stop taking drugs that, in some cases, have
drastically improved their quality of life? How great are the health
risks--and are the risks worth taking?</TE>
<TE>   Doctors' phones have been ringing off the hook with calls from
worried, confused and frightened women.</TE>
<TE>   "Patients are scared. There's an uneasiness because they don't
know what to do," said Dr. Edward Yosowitz, a Houston
obstetrician-gynecologist.</TE>
<TE>   The study, part of a major research effort called the Women's
Health Initiative, found that women who took the hormones estrogen
and progestin after menopause were at increased risk for breast
cancer, blood clots, strokes and heart attacks compared to those who
took an identical placebo.</TE>
<TE>   Risks for hip fractures and colorectal cancer were lowered by the
hormones, but the study's safety committee terminated the study three
years short of its scheduled duration because the risks outweighed
the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The increases in risk detected in the study were significant but
slight. But that is no comfort to women who in many cases took
hormones because they thought the drugs would help them stay
healthier into old age.</TE>
<TE>   The decisions women will make will be very personal, said Dr.
Nananda Col, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an
internist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. They may have to
reconsider why they were taking the hormones in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "The advice I'm giving to women who are on particularly the
preparations in the study is that we should probably be thinking
about tapering them off," she said. "We need to go back and figure
out why they were taking it to begin with."</TE>
<TE>   One of the primary reasons that women have taken hormone therapy
over the long term is that many studies have suggested the drugs
protect against heart disease. The new data throw cold water on this
theory. They reveal that, in contrast, taking estrogen and progestin
had a negative effect on cardiovascular health.</TE>
<TE>   Heart disease risks, doctors point out, can be better addressed
through lifestyle changes such as exercise, weight loss, dietary
changes and drugs such as aspirin, statins and beta blockers.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who are taking the hormones for protection of their
bones--a benefit supported by the study--may be better off taking
some other medication, said Dr. Clifford Rosen, an osteoporosis
expert at the University of Maine who has patients who take hormones
to protect their bones. The earlier-than-expected breast cancer risk
is "making us rethink what our long-term strategy will be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This presents a serious dilemma to some of his younger patients
with skeletal problems. Other bone-protecting medicines, such as the
bisphosphonates, are more expensive and have side effects, Rosen
said. Another drug, raloxifene (Evista), is an artificial form of
estrogen that does not appear to harm the breast. But it aggravates
hot flashes.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said they have known hormone replacement therapy confers
slightly increased risks for blood clots and breast cancer, and have
urged patients to factor those risks into their decision. But some
doctors were surprised at how quickly the heightened breast cancer
risk appeared--after just three years--and said that they might
recommend shorter time on the hormone for women seeking relief of
menopausal symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Wanda Critchfield, a 62-year-old public health nurse in
Sebastopol, Calif., who has been taking hormones for 17 years, said
she "isn't buying into" the latest uproar. During menopause, she was
plagued with hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleeplessness and
intermittent bleeding. Even though there is a history of heart
disease in her family, she believes the benefits of hormone
replacement therapy outweigh the risks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've thoroughly researched the issue," she said, "and I'm going
to stay with it."</TE>
<TE>   But Harvard's Col said she is reluctant to even recommend
short-term use of hormones because some of the heart risk showed up
early in the study. There are alternatives for menopause treatment,
she said, including antidepressants and high blood pressure
medication to help with hot flashes, and moisturizers and estrogen
creams to help with vaginal dryness and atrophy.</TE>
<TE>   Some women, she added, are likely to want to remain on hormones
because the drugs are believed to help a woman's skin stay youthful.
Others simply feel better on hormones or hope that the therapy will
help ward off memory loss and Alzheimer's disease, as some studies
have suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Quality-of-life issues need to be addressed in considering hormone
replacement therapy, said Dr. Dan Mishell, chairman of the department
of obstetrics and gynecology at USC's Keck School of Medicine. The
study "didn't address Alzheimer's disease; it didn't address hot
flashes; it didn't address genitourinary problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The study also tested just one formulation of the hormones
estrogen and progestin, Mishell said. For instance, it may turn out
that women may do better taking just estrogen alone, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The risks and benefits associated with taking only estrogen are
not yet known. Another large study that is part of the Women's Health
Initiative is exploring that question and is expected to have results
in 2005. The fact that this study was not halted at the same time as
the study testing estrogen and progestin in combination is
encouraging, Mishell said.</TE>
<TE>   Among doctors, there is likely to be a wide variety of responses.
"Even in our group [of seven doctors], there are questions about
which way to go," Yosowitz said. Some, he said, are keeping their
patients on hormones, while others are stopping the therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Lord, a gynecologist in Silver Spring, Md., has
administered hormone treatments to his patients for more than 25
years. He said that while the study is "mildly surprising," it is not
"an emergency situation."</TE>
<TE>   He said he spent much of Tuesday reassuring patients, many of whom
are not on the treatment, that they were not in grave danger.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the subjects of the study, only 15% of his patients
continue hormone therapy for more than five years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, hormone therapy will likely still play a role in
treatment for women after menopause. But doctors and patients will
probably be more cautious in starting the regimen and especially in
recommending long-term treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now everyone is swinging over as if we never ought to use
hormones for anyone," said Dr. Isaac Schiff, chief of obstetrics and
gynecology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. "I think
there is a place for estrogen replacement therapy--that it will get
its rightful place for symptom relief."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Lianne Hart in Houston and Lisa Fackler in
Washington, and researcher Anna M. Virtue in Miami contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Surgery for Knees May Be Useless</HD>
<DH>Arthritis: New study, which compares the results of a
placebo procedure, finds that the operation to relieve pain might not
be worth it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year, 650,000 people undergo painful and costly knee surgery to
relieve the pain of arthritis in a procedure that may actually be
useless, medical researchers said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In the first systematic assessment of arthroscopic surgery to
treat osteoarthritis, the researchers discovered that people who
underwent a sham operation felt just as much pain relief, and
sometimes even more, than those who underwent the real knee surgery,
according to a study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   By challenging one of the most popular procedures for the most
common form of arthritis, the findings cast doubt on the
billion-dollar industry of arthroscopic knee surgery. More than a
third of all such surgeries in the United States are performed to
relieve osteoarthritis pain.</LD>
<TE>   "We have shown the entire driving force behind this ... industry
is the placebo effect," said Dr. Nelda P. Wray, a health services
researcher at the Houston VA Medical Center and Baylor College of
Medicine. Wray was the senior scientist on the study.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure first became popular in the 1980s and early 1990s
but was never rigorously tested. Unlike new drugs or medical devices,
which must undergo extensive clinical trials to prove their
effectiveness before they can be used, most surgical procedures
aren't clinically tested.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to rigorously assess surgery is to compare the real
procedure with a fake without the patient knowing which would be
applied. Such unorthodox clinical trials using placebo surgeries have
been notoriously difficult to do because of ethical concerns and the
difficulty of recruiting patients.</TE>
<TE>   The study conducted by Wray and her colleagues is only the second
placebo surgery trial in the last 40 years, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers tracked 180 patients for two years. Some of the
patients received the surgery while others received placebo surgery,
in which a small incision was made but nothing else was done.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups of patients reported virtually the same moderate
improvements in pain and joint function, the researchers reported.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Bruce Moseley, lead author of the study and a clinical
associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Baylor, said that there
is no reason to perform arthroscopy for arthritis knee pain, although
the procedure still helps people with tears to the ligament or
meniscus.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the findings, some doctors defend the procedure. Seaid
Rezaian, a Beverly Hills physician who performs these surgeries, said
that if the patient is younger and the destruction doesn't involve
cartilage of the joint, the surgery will be very effective.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, patients received one of three procedures: an
arthroscopic lavage, in which fluid is washed through the knee join;
a lavage and debridement, in which torn or loose cartilage is removed
from the knee; or a sham surgery.</TE>
<TE>   During the two years of follow-up after the surgeries, researchers
measured changes in the patients' pain and knee function, assessing
if they could lift groceries better and climb stairs faster.</TE>
<TE>   All groups felt the same degree of improvement, leading
researchers to conclude that the benefit could be attributed entirely
to the placebo effect. At several points in the trial, the placebo
group actually reported better outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors aren't surprised by these findings. Dr. David
McAllister, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the David
Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said, "The treatment never made
any sense. The proposed advantage is to wash away debris, but that
doesn't change arthritis."</TE>
<TE>   Moseley, who is also an orthopedic surgeon for the Houston Rockets
and Houston Comets basketball teams, had his own skepticism regarding
the procedure. During his early medical training, Moseley was "struck
by how little visual change there was after surgery."</TE>
<TE>   Wanting to determine exactly how the surgery might help arthritis,
Moseley went to Wray, who heads the Houston Center for Quality of
Care and has expertise in designing clinical trials. Wray convinced
Moseley that if they truly wanted to understand what the effect the
procedure had on knee pain, they would need to include a placebo
surgery into the trial, a very difficult thing to do in the ethical
climate of today's medical community.</TE>
<TE>   There have only been two previous placebo controlled surgery
trials in this country, the first in the 1950s on a commonly used
procedure for angina. Doctors found the sham surgery worked as well
as the real one, and the procedure went the way of the dinosaurs.</TE>
<TE>   Placebo surgery fell out of favor for the next 40 years. It was
considered too unethical. Then in 1999, researchers tested the effect
of fetal cell injections into brains of Parkinson's patients. Half of
the 40 trial participants underwent sham surgery. Three of those
reported feeling better.</TE>
<TE>   But critics of the Parkinson's study argued that patients were
undergoing surgical risk without the possibility of reward, an
argument that has made it difficult to conduct placebo surgery
trials.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Baruch Brody, director of Baylor's Center for Medical
Ethics and Health Policies, saw the issue another way. "This surgery
has been done in thousands of people without any indication that it
helps. What's unethical is doing these procedures without a clinical
trial."</TE>
<TE>   Wray and Moseley worked closely with Brody to design a trial that
met strict ethical standards. They made sure the placebo surgery
carried little risk: Patients were sedated rather than given the
general anesthesia administered to those undergoing the real surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers also made sure that patients understood they might
undergo fake surgery. Almost half refused to participate, which is
considered relatively high, indicating to Brody that participants
clearly understood the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Wray emphasized the study's wider implications for health policy.
She hopes the findings will convince the medical community that "the
placebo effect is important in health care, and it should be
understood and used ethically."</TE>
<TE>   Brody, the study's ethics collaborator, concurs. "There are lots
of other surgeries that have never been validated," and this study
provides an example of how to test them.</TE>
<TE>   The best candidates for placebo trials are surgeries for relief of
subjective symptoms like pain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Shekelle, a physician at the VA Greater Los Angeles
Healthcare System and associate professor of medicine at the UCLA
medical school, said the "implications are potentially profound."</TE>
<TE>   "What is the appropriate thing to do for these patients? No one
thinks it is ethical to lie to a patient or to do a useless
procedure," said Shekelle. "Should we give them a procedure that
isn't better than placebo?"</TE>

<HD>Selig Felt That His Hands Were Tied</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 73rd All-Star game was history. The histrionics were only
starting.</LD>
<LD>   All of it--Miller Park field littered with debris, the chant of
"Let them play!", the second-guessing that came with the morning
newspapers and the talk shows that he knew he shouldn't listen to but
did anyway--weighed heavily on Bud Selig Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   He remained secure in feeling that he had made the only feasible
decision in calling the game after the 11th inning with the score
tied, 7-7, and insistent that the situation would never happen again,
but that didn't ease the discomfort of what he said was a sleepless
night, his "longest and loneliest."</LD>
<TE>   Think what you will of the commissioner, but he is a man who cares
about his sport, who brought it back to his hometown. It is easy to
believe, as he'd said, that he was in shock during the 20-minute
drive to his house, one he has made a thousand times, "but never like
last night."</TE>
<TE>   "My wife is having hip replacement surgery next week and has a
sinus infection on top of that and she left the game before it went
into extra innings," Selig said by phone Wednesday. "I said, 'Don't
worry, Honey, somebody will jack one out and I'll be home soon.'
Little did I know that all hell would break loose."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody jacked one out, the managers used all 60 players, and there
was Selig taking abuse from those hometown fans, another in a series
of dark moments for the commissioner and his sport.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, the Milwaukee weather came up overcast Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Selig was asked if he didn't feel he was living under a black
cloud?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel that way at all," he said. "I've had too many good
things happen in my life."</TE>
<TE>   This, of course, was far from a good thing, a painful and
heartbreaking lesson, said the commissioner, but one easily
rectified, he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe rosters will be expanded.</TE>
<TE>   More important, he said, maybe an emphasis will be put on managers
to leave starting players in the game longer, have pitchers work a
bit farther.</TE>
<TE>   "The game is managed differently now," Selig said of the stress on
using every player. "Maybe it goes back to the incident with Mike
Mussina in 1993."</TE>
<TE>   Mussina was with the Baltimore Orioles then, and the All-Star game
was being played in Camden Yards. Toronto Manager Cito Gaston was in
charge of the American League team and had already angered Oriole
fans by selecting four of his Blue Jays to go with the three who had
been voted in.</TE>
<TE>   When Gaston failed to use Mussina, leaving him warming up in the
bullpen as the American League wrapped up a 9-3 win, he was serenaded
with an obscene chant and wouldn't even risk leaving the dugout to
congratulate his team as it left the field.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, no manager wants to catch that kind of abuse, and the
memory of Bill Freehan catching all 15 innings in the 1967 game in
Anaheim, or Stan Musial playing all 12 innings of the 1955 game,
which he eventually won with a home run, are freeze frames from a
distant All-Star era. Now, as happened Tuesday night, fans see more
of Rob Fick than Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by colleague Jason Reid in San Francisco on Wednesday,
Giant General Manager Brian Sabean said it was unfair to blame Selig
for the latest controversy because he didn't manage the teams and,
for the most part, the managers weren't to be blamed, either, because
they felt obligated to use every player as a type of "defensive
mechanism" for the heat they take in selecting the teams.</TE>
<TE>   "So they kind of get out of that hot box by being willing to play
everybody," Sabean said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger manager Tom Lasorda disagrees with that thinking. He
told colleague Rob Fernas that you can't exhaust your staff early,
that you have to manage the game almost as if it's a regular-season
game.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to protect yourself because you can be caught with your
pants down," Lasorda said. "When I had meetings with my [four]
All-Star teams, I told them, 'Hey, I'm not here to put everybody in
the game. I'm here to win, and we might have to win without all of
you guys playing. That's the way it's going to be.' "</TE>
<TE>   It may be only an exhibition game, but it's hard to erase the
memory of Pete Rose leveling Ray Fosse at the plate, and if it should
be honor enough just to be selected, if it shouldn't be necessary to
use every player, some of the change in managing tactics also stems
from a change in pitching deployment.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there are almost as many relievers selected as starters.</TE>
<TE>   There were only three starters on Bob Brenly's 10-man National
League staff Tuesday night, and only five on Joe Torre's nine-man AL
staff.</TE>
<TE>   Relievers, though, are basically conditioned to work only an
inning at a time, meaning the manager can work through an All-Star
staff in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   The situation was complicated this year when Randy Johnson and
Pedro Martinez chose not to participate, and Tom Glavine had to be
replaced by Vicente Padilla because of a blister on his pitching
hand. Padilla became central to Selig's decision when Brenly informed
the commissioner that the Philadelphia right-hander was having
trouble getting loose and staying loose, even though he had worked
two hitless innings when the game was called.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to criticize and second-guess, but I had to make a
decision on the facts at hand," Selig said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no pitchers left, no position players left, and
[Padilla] was struggling, according to Bob. If he'd been healthy, I'd
have let the game continue, although [Torre] also had concerns about
[having Freddy Garcia pitch another inning, which would have been his
third].</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, I've passed the Rubicon. I don't have the luxury
of sitting there and pontificating about how Joe and Bob had used
their rosters. I mean, it would have been flippant and not very
realistic for me to say to them, 'You guys figure it out.'</TE>
<TE>   "In the first place, I didn't have a problem with the job they
did. They had given the fans an opportunity to see every player.
Secondly, it was my responsibility to make a decision. As
commissioner, I have to balance concerns of the fans against welfare
of the players and the game, and sometimes you're caught in a
difficult and sensitive conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "As upset as the fans were, I can assure you that I was just as
upset. It would have been painful anywhere, but happening here in
Milwaukee, where we were hoping to have everything go well and where
we'd had five golden days ... well, it was tough, but there was no
other option."</TE>
<TE>   Well, there was one.</TE>
<TE>   Selig said he was hoping, maybe praying, Benito Santiago would
deliver a game-winning hit with a runner in scoring position in the
bottom of the 11th.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have gone over the railing and lifted him on my shoulders,"
Selig said. "I was hoping somebody would take me off the hook."</TE>

decision to call off the All-Star game, but it still weighed heavily

<HD>All-Star Game Is Prime-Time Dud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>There wasn't a winner in the All-Star game, but there was a loser:
the sport's television rating.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday night's controversial 7-7, 11-inning tie in Milwaukee set
a record for baseball's lowest-rated All-Star game in prime time,
getting a 9.5 rating and 17 share, Nielsen Media Research said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The rating was down 14% from the 11.0 for the American League's
4-1 victory last year in Seattle. The previous prime-time low was a
10.1 for the AL's 6-3 victory two years ago in Atlanta, and the only
lower rating was an 8.6 for the 1953 game in Cincinnati, which was
played in the afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Like network ratings in general, the All-Star game rating has
steadily declined. From a peak of 28.5 in 1970, it dropped below 20
for the first time in 1987. The game drew a 15.7 rating in 1994, then
dropped to 13.9 the following year after a strike wiped out the World
Series for the first time in 90 years.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night's game was seen by an average of 10,023,000
households, less than half the 20.38 million that tuned in 20 years
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Still, baseball got a higher rating than this year's NBA All-Star
game on NBC (8.2), the Pro Bowl on ABC (4.3) and the NHL All-Star
game on ABC (1.8).</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's telecast of the Home Run Derby on Monday night drew a 6.11
rating--the second-highest rated show this year on the network. The
competition, won by the New York Yankees' Jason Giambi, was up 18%
from last year's event, which drew a 5.19.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants says he has used creatine
supplements and protein pills, according to a televised interview.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds' acknowledgment he took the legal supplements comes in the
face of much criticism and scrutiny about steroid use among baseball
players.</LD>
<LD>   Creatine is an amino acid produced naturally by the liver and
kidneys and stored in muscles. Athletes often take supplements to
gain extra energy, train longer and bulk up.</LD>
<TE>   "Definitely. I take supplements. I have taken creatine, protein
pills and amino acids. To replenish your body is very important,"
Bonds told Lisa Guerrero of Fox Sports Net in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds has repeatedly denied using steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' agent and Giant officials could not be reached for further
comment on the outfielder's supplement use.</TE>

<TE>   Atlanta announcer Skip Caray expects to return to the broadcast
booth July 18 after having angioplasty to clear an artery.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves departed Wednesday for a six-game trip to Montreal and
Chicago without Caray, who underwent the procedure Monday--one week
after the return of fellow team broadcaster Don Sutton, who had
surgery to remove a cancerous kidney.</TE>
<TE>   Caray credited Sutton for his decision to have a body scan Friday
that revealed an artery that was 96% blocked, putting him at risk for
a heart attack. The growth on Sutton's kidney was detected through a
body scan.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe Don a glass of wine, because this wouldn't have been
discovered until after the season," Caray told The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Mariners put right-handed pitcher Rafael Soriano on
the 15-day disabled list because of a strained right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners recalled left-hander Mark Watson from triple-A Tacoma
to take Soriano's place on the roster. The move was retroactive to
July 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Alberto Castillo cleared waivers and accepted an
assignment from the New York Yankees to Columbus, their affiliate in
the triple-A International League.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Andy Benes endured a rough outing in a
rehabilitation start for the Class-A Potomac Cannons.</TE>
<TE>   Benes, who is on the 60-day disabled list because of an arthritic
right knee, gave up seven earned runs, eight hits and six walks in
seven innings in Potomac's 8-7 win over the Salem Rockies on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Benes is attempting a comeback at triple-A Memphis, but was
pitching for Potomac since Memphis is on an All-Star break and it was
his day to start.</TE>
<TE>   Benes is a candidate to be called up by the Cardinals this weekend
when St. Louis resumes play in San Diego after the All-Star break.</TE>

http://auctions.yahoo.com, beginning today.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds will go to Major League Baseball's Reviving Baseball in
Inner Cities (RBI) program, which was created in 1989 by Los
Angeles-area major league scouts and has grown into organizations in
140 U.S. cities.</TE>
<TE>   A silent auction of bases decorated and autographed by Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy and players Shawn Green, Paul Lo Duca and Kevin
Brown will be held at Dodger Stadium on July 20, when the Dodgers
play host to the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds will be split between RBI and the Dodger Dream

<LD>Is there anyone else who thinks that Augusta National could have
handled the situation with the National Council of Women's
Organizations just a little better?</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, the time is coming when there will be female members at
Augusta, everybody knows that, but what transpired this week isn't
going to speed the process any.</LD>
<LD>   All right, so a respected women's group believes the private club
needs to start inviting women to become members and says so in a
letter to the club. Fair enough, it's a position, whatever.</LD>
<TE>   But instead of simply responding with a "Thanks for your letter
... we're a private club but having women members is something we are
looking at ... things move slowly around here ... sincerely yours,"
something totally unexpected happened.</TE>
<TE>   Club chairman Hootie Johnson let off some major steam.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, whose anger in his three-page statement released to the
media was obvious, turned a medium-sized issue into a giant one. It
has no chance to go away now and little chance to be smoothed over.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson even went so far as to list points of a campaign that he
could expect to see over the issue. Tongue in cheek, Martha Burk of
the NCWO thanked Johnson for the blueprint.</TE>
<TE>   Bogey for Hootie.</TE>
<TE>   That's Just Grand</TE>
<TE>   It's the third leg of the Tour de Slam for Tiger Woods, but even
if he wins the British Open next week at Muirfield in Scotland, it's
not that big a deal--according to Jack Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   "For all intents and purposes, he's already done it," Nicklaus
said Wednesday. "He didn't do it in one year, so now you want him to
do it in one year. All I know is, he had all four of them at the same
time."</TE>
<TE>   But isn't a true Grand Slam all four majors in the same calendar
year?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's insignificant," Nicklaus said. "You [reporters] want
to make a big deal out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Well, actually it is sort of a big deal, basically because it has
never been done before.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Woods considers holding all four major titles at the
same time to be a Grand Slam and everything else is just quibbling.
The record shows that Woods did hold all four of the major
professional titles at one time--the 2000 U.S. Open, British Open and
PGA Championship and the 2001 Masters.</TE>
<TE>   In Nicklaus' opinion, that was more difficult to accomplish than a
calendar year slam might be.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe not. What if Tiger does pull off the Grand Slam, with
victories at Muirfield and then the PGA Championship at Hazeltine in
August?</TE>
<TE>   "That would be not only unbelievable, but super unbelievable,"
Nicklaus said.</TE>
<TE>   Mac Update</TE>
<TE>   He is 51 and he hasn't played a PGA Tour event in three years, but
Mac O'Grady will be making a comeback--sort of--when he tries to
qualify next week at the B.C. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, O'Grady will try it in his noted free-spirited style.</TE>
<TE>   "I come from the other end of the galaxy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Grady will play left-handed and says he intends to play under
the name Mac O'Grady II.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I want to start all over again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not all. O'Grady also wants to try to get into the
field in the past champions' category--he won twice on the PGA
Tour--and hopes to also play right-handed as Mac O'Grady.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me I'm not weird," said, well, presumably O'Grady I.</TE>
<TE>   In his dream, O'Grady I and O'Grady II will wind up in the same
pairing--one person, two names.</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't it be delightful?" said O'Grady, who has been through
two previous name changes, from Phil McGleno to Phillip McClelland
O'Grady to Mac O'Grady.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows I have multiple personalities."</TE>
<TE>   When he told the PGA Tour of his intentions, officials laughed,
but said only one entry would be possible. O'Grady I and II say they
are considering litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   Where's Tiger? He left Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday and supposedly is
fishing in Ireland, possibly on the river Moy near Ballina.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Associated Press, ESPN inquired about whether
Woods might attend Wednesday night's ESPY awards and was told the
chances of getting him were "less than zero percent."</TE>
<TE>   What a Player</TE>
<TE>   News item: Gary Player, 66, who will try to qualify for his 46th
consecutive British Open, begins every day with 1,000 sit-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Impressive.</TE>
<TE>   More numbers: He's a three-time champion. Let him in.</TE>
<TE>   A Trophy House</TE>
<TE>   The quote of the week is from Juli Inkster, who won the U.S.
Women's Open on the very same Prairie Dunes course in Hutchinson,
Kan., where she had won the U.S. Women's Amateur in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Said Inkster, "I think I'm going to have to buy a condo."</TE>
<TE>   Dearly Beloved</TE>
<TE>   The second quote of the week is from Michael Campbell, who managed
to win the European Open by one shot last week and had to explain
afterward how he'd bogeyed the last four holes: "I was preparing my
acceptance speech."</TE>
<TE>   U-Turn City, Baby</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, if Campbell hadn't made his 18-inch bogey putt at
the last hole, he wouldn't have been nearly as embarrassed as Retief
Goosen. A miss by Campbell would have meant a five-player playoff
with Campbell, Padraig Harrington, Bradley Dredge, Paul Lawrie and
Goosen, who had already left for the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Gulp!</TE>
<TE>   Western Open champion Jerry Kelly on his ultra-competitive,
golf-playing mother, Lee: "I'm lucky she didn't eat me when I was
younger."</TE>
<TE>   Consolation Prize</TE>
<TE>   It took a record-tying low closing round by Inkster to beat her,
but Annika Sorenstam can probably find solace somewhere: Her $315,000
payday made her the LPGA's first $10-million woman.</TE>
<TE>   Tune In</TE>
<TE>   News item: The U.S. Women's Open gets a 2.2 overnight rating for
its last round, compared to the 2.1 rating for the last round of the
Western Open on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: LPGA Commissioner Ty Votaw likes to say that you can't
compare the LPGA to the PGA Tour and that the LPGA must be compared
to other women's sports. OK. The women's singles final at Wimbledon
had a 4.6 overnight rating.</TE>
<TE>   Love's Labor</TE>
<TE>   That fan who yelled "Choker!" at Davis Love III in the last round
of the Western Open didn't make him one bit happy.</TE>
<TE>   Said Love, "I don't like going to the ropes and yelling at people,
but it seems like I do it every week now."</TE>
<TE>   He says that fans are overstepping their bounds, that they're not
supposed to yell.</TE>
<TE>   But Kelly said that's where golf is headed.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, every other sport gets heckled but golf," Kelly said.
"You know the heckling is coming. I'm sorry, you're going to have to
have some thick skin to play this game from now on because New York
[the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black] just opened a nice, big can of
worms. It's going to be different."</TE>
<TE>   Moving News</TE>
<TE>   It's the oldest event on the Senior PGA Tour, having begun in 1978
as the Legends of Golf, the brainchild of the late Fred Raphael. And
next year, the venerable Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf gets its
seventh home in 26 years and its fifth in the last seven years.</TE>
<TE>   The Legends tournament is moving to the Westin Savannah Harbor in
Savannah, Ga., for 2003-2006. Previous sites: King &amp; Bear Course at
St. Augustine, Slammer &amp; Squire Course at St. Augustine, Amelia
Island, PGA West at La Quinta, Barton Creek in Austin, Texas, and
Onion Creek in Austin.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winning a Grade I race with a former claimer is no cinch, but trainer
Roger Stein has done it before.</LD>
<LD>   Southern Truce, who had once been claimed for $16,000, upset
two-time Eclipse champion mare Paseana in the 1993 Santa Margarita
Handicap at Santa Anita. Early the next year, she came back at 11-1
in the Santa Monica Handicap at the same track.</LD>
<LD>   Stein will be trying to pull off an even bigger surprise Sunday
when he sends out Macaneo in the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup.</LD>
<TE>   Claimed for $50,000 by Stein for owners Robert Alperson, Nate
Friedman and Marshall Kadner in his U.S. debut on April 6, Macaneo
will be the longest shot in the expected field of six in the 1
1/4-mile Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   When the gates open Sunday afternoon, his owners already will be
$20,000 in the hole. They supplemented the Argentine-bred for $12,500
and they will pay $3,750 more to enter and another $3,750 to start.
This means the 5-year-old son of Payant will have to finish fourth to
show a profit. The fifth-place finisher in the Gold Cup earns
$15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not Macaneo can beat two of his five rivals--probable
favorite Milwaukee Brew, Dollar Bill, Out Of Mind, Momentum and Sky
Jack--remains to be seen, but Stein is looking forward to Sunday. The
trainer, who is also the longtime host of a weekend radio show on
racing, is eager to try Macaneo on the main track.</TE>
<TE>   Since being claimed out of a race where he finished seventh of 10,
the chestnut has won two of four turf races. He ran wide but still
won by a head against $50,000 foes on June 8, then returned 15 days
later and edged L'effaceur by a neck in a $62,500 claimer.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he trains, he appears to be a better horse on the dirt,"
Stein said. "If we ran him for $80,000 on the dirt, I know he would
get claimed because people have offered me more than $80,000 for him.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jockey Corey] Nakatani worked him [Tuesday morning] and he went
six furlongs in 1:10 4/5. I thought he worked very well and did it
easily.</TE>
<TE>   "Class-wise, I don't know if he's this good and I don't know about
the 1 1/4 miles, but this isn't a field loaded with superstars, so
maybe I can get lucky. I believe he'll run better than anybody who
looks at his form would expect him to run."</TE>
<TE>   A winner of eight of 15 in his career, Macaneo has three wins and
a third in five previous races on dirt. His last main-track start was
his final race in South America last Dec. 12. He won by three lengths
over six opponents, covering the mile in 1:35 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   This will be his first start in a graded stakes and his first
beyond 1 1/16 miles. He will be ridden by Patrick Valenzuela, who
long ago clinched the riding title for the meet, which ends July 21.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Patrick's going to go out there and not be concerned with
the tote board and with what people are going to say," Stein said.
"He'll just go out there and do his thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this horse will get 1 1/8 miles, but I don't know about
the 1 1/4 miles. He might get to the eighth pole and then give it up.</TE>
<TE>   "This horse is crazy enough that right now he thinks he can beat
anybody.... I'm not saying I wouldn't mind trading places with
Milwaukee Brew, but I don't think [trainer] Bobby Frankel is going to
swap horses. I think Dollar Bill [shipped in for this race from
Churchill Downs] would just be a classified allowance horse if he was
out here [all the time].</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing that can happen is that [Macaneo] runs sixth,
which is where everybody thinks he will. If he happens to run third
or better, then everybody's going to say, 'Wow!' If he's somehow able
to win, well, I would be famous for a day. He's going to be 20- or
30-1 and we both know 20- and 30-1 shots have won before."</TE>
<TE>   Since being claimed by Alperson, a retired steel executive;
Friedman, a Beverly Hills attorney, and Kadner, a Beverly Hills
doctor, Macaneo has earned $54,300. If he does shock the world on
Sunday, he won't be the first former claimer to have taken the Gold
Cup in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Early Pioneer, a 24-1 longshot who had been claimed for
$62,500 by trainer Vladimir Cerin for owners David and Holly Wilson,
beat favored General Challenge by a length.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Caller One, a multiple-stakes winning sprinter, has been retired
because of a sesamoid injury. Trained by Jim Chapman, the 5-year-old
won 10 of 20 and earned $3,184,500.... Jockey Kent Desormeaux will
begin a five-day suspension Friday, stemming from his
disqualification aboard Dublino in Saturday's inaugural American Oaks
at Hollywood Park. He will be able to ride in the Hollywood Gold Cup,
Swaps Stakes and A Gleam Handicap on Sunday, however, as all are
designated races.</TE>

<LD>   Trujillo ranks second in the jockey standings with 36 victories,
four fewer than defending champion Rene Douglas.</LD>
<LD>   With Churchill Downs closed until the fall, local fans are getting
more races from Arlington Park to wager on these days, and, in fact,
the entire nine-race card is being offered today.</LD>
<TE>   Trujillo, who showed some promise during his time in California,
has mounts in four races and his best chance for a winner looks to be
with Halo Of Hearts in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   A 3-year-old son of Sunny's Halo owned by James and Sue Burns and
trained by Sam David Jr., Halo Of Hearts has won two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The latest victory came under Trujillo on June 15 when the
Texas-bred won by nearly five lengths as the 2-1 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Trujillo's other mounts are longshot Ozilias Class in the second,
Tonyspal Craig in the seventh and Fusto in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Hot Market will try for his third win in his last
four starts when he takes on four others in the third at Hollywood
Park. The 7 1/2-furlong race is the first leg of a pick six that has
a carry-over of $97,217.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Dave Hofmans. Twenty-three of the trainer's first 43
starters at Hollywood Park have finished first or second.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Hansbury. The 4-year-old Pleasant Tap gelding is 0 for
22 entering today's eighth at Solano.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the first keying Orange'em on
top of Private Aviator, Red Vintage and Warn Me Again in the two hole
with all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/147. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11.20/$837.20. Total money bet: $964.</TE>

<HD>Muirfield May Be Soft Touch for Third Leg</HD>
<DH>Golf: Former director at Turnberry says British Open course
has American feel, and the only thing that can stop Woods from
winning is the weather.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Gunson knows British Opens. He knows Muirfield, site of this
year's British Open in Scotland, and he thinks he knows Tiger Woods'
chances of winning the third leg of golf's Grand Slam there next
week.</LD>
<LD>   "If the weather is consistent," Gunson said, "Tiger will win."</LD>
<LD>   Gunson, 41, is the former director of golf at Turnberry Golf
Links, site of the 1977, '86 and '94 British Opens. He now holds the
same position at Shady Canyon Golf Club, an exclusive private club in
Irvine. Gunson oversaw the last two British Opens at Turnberry and
attended all four played at Muirfield, about 100 miles away, since
1970.</LD>
<TE>   And when Gunson talks, people listen. He has letters of
recommendation from PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem, European PGA
Tour Executive Director Ken Scholfield, famed golf instructor David
Leadbetter, and European players Colin Montgomerie and Sam Torrance
to facilitate his transition to Shady Canyon, a Tom Fazio-designed
course.</TE>
<TE>   Gunson said weather is about the only thing that can stop Woods
from winning next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It can change so quickly there," he said. "It will be flat and
calm, then 30 minutes later it will be a full-fledged rainstorm with
strong wind. If he happens to get a bad draw with the weather, that
could jeopardize his chances of winning."</TE>
<TE>   Gunson said it rains about 50% of the time in Scotland, but that
rain has been particularly heavy this year. In June, there were 26
days of rain, a record.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, the course at Muirfield is softer and slower than when
Nick Faldo won there in 1992, which means the traditional links-style
course has become more like an American-style, target course.</TE>
<TE>   Woods should benefit because he won't have to rely on the luck of
the bounce traditionally associated with British bump-and-run golf.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be able to control the ball better," Gunson said. "It's a
links course, but I don't think it will play like a links course."</TE>
<TE>   History shows that the final two legs of the Grand Slam are the
majors most difficult for Woods. Since turning professional in 1996,
he has finished out of the top 20 in majors only four times, the 1997
and 2001 British Opens and the PGA Championships the same years.</TE>
<TE>   He won his only British Open title in 2000 at St. Andrews, a
course Gunson said wasn't much of a test for Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, St. Andrews was a fairly easy course, especially for
[Woods]," Gunson said. "There is no rough on many of the holes and
the landing areas off the tees are huge."</TE>
<TE>   Muirfield will play at 7,033 yards, tame by today's standards, and
has only two par-four holes longer than 450 yards. The longest is
475, but the fairways are narrow and hazards are in play, even for
long hitters such as Woods.</TE>
<TE>   The deep, well-placed bunkers could also slow Woods, who did not
hit into a bunker when he won at St. Andrews two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, you'll see him whacking out of a bunker or two [at
Muirfield]," Gunson said. "And if you are in one of those bunkers,
it's a sand wedge to get out. You can't get a three-iron on the ball
and get it out in those bunkers. At St. Andrews, he could just blow
his drives past the bunkers. You can't do that at Muirfield."</TE>
<TE>   Gunson lists Phil Mickelson, Padraig Harrington and Darren Clarke
among those he thinks will challenge Woods, but adds that the pursuit
of the Grand Slam might make all the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen that Tiger loves a challenge," Gunson said. "He plays
better under the gun. The challenge is now set and that will motivate
him. Then again, he's got the ability to win any time, any- where."</TE>

<HD>Nicklaus Withdraws From Senior Players</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Nicklaus has withdrawn from this week's Senior Players
Championship at Dearborn, Mich., because of muscle spasms.</LD>
<LD>   "It's always frustrating when you can't play," Nicklaus said
Wednesday after pain forced him to stop an afternoon practice session
after hitting about 15 balls.</LD>
<LD>   Nicklaus, who has not won a Senior Tour event since 1996, said he
enjoyed nine holes of golf on Tuesday in Ohio with family and
friends. However, he was in pain Wednesday morning and it lingered
until he withdrew from the pro-am after nine holes later in the day.</LD>
<TE>   "I just don't like to be in the position of keeping somebody out
of the tournament," Nicklaus said. "Would I like to play? You're darn
right I'd like to play. I thought after playing yesterday, 'Boy, I am
ready to play. I am ready to go.' I woke up this morning and I
couldn't stand on my right side to save my life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 62 years old. I'd rather do what I did yesterday than be
worried about what I was trying to do out here."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus, who has played only three competitive tournaments this
year, did not play in the U.S. Senior Open last month because of a
recurring back problem, which also forced him to withdraw from the
Senior PGA Championship earlier in June.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said the Senior Tour has reached
an agreement in principle with The Golf Channel to provide live
coverage of three rounds of at least 10 events in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Golf Channel will also provide live coverage of the Friday
round of every tournament as PAX, which will not be part of the
broadcast package beyond this year, does now.</TE>
<TE>   CNBC will continue to be a part of the tour's television deal by
carrying the tournaments the Golf Channel does not, most live. NBC
will continue to carry the same major tournaments it does now.</TE>

<LD>Taylor Wood of Laguna Niguel shot his second consecutive round of 68
and his eight-under-par 136 has him two strokes off the lead at the
midway point of the AJGA Rolex Tournament of Champions at The Desert
Mountain Club in Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   In the girls' event, Erica Blasberg of Corona moved into a tie for
second place at one-over 145, two shots behind leader Brittany
Lincicome of Pinellas Park, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Wood is one of 11 Southland boys to make the cut, although only
Santa Barbara's Kevin Larsen (143), Riverside's Josh Wooding (143),
La Mirada's Daniel Im (144) and Anaheim Hills' Jordan Nasser (144)
were within 10 shots of leader Randy Lowry of Spring, Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Blasberg is one of seven Southland girls to make the cut. Jane
Park of Beaumont is seven shots off the pace at 150.</TE>

<HD>Fiscal Reforms? The Fix Is In</HD>
<DH>Nothing will change without public outrage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, it seems the most recent scandals have made a WorldCom of
difference. Any politician with an instinct for self-preservation
(and what other kind is there?) no longer can be seen as standing
against corporate reform. So the "genius of capitalism" crowd has
adopted a new strategy: publicly embrace reform while working
diligently behind the scenes to undermine it.</LD>
<LD>   It's a time-honored Washington ploy--the strategic retreat stage
of a three-part campaign that starts with full-bore resistance, moves
on to insincere support, then culminates in back-channel efforts to
kneecap whatever meager reforms manage to survive the legislative
process. For a textbook example of how this game works, one need look
no further than the efforts of the Business Roundtable, a powerful
lobbying group made up of the CEOs of 150 of the largest corporations
in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as mid-May, the CEOs were still in Stage One:
full-throated resistance to change. Standing shoulder to shoulder
with such anti-corporate reform stalwarts as Sen. Phil Gramm
(R-Texas), Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) and, yes, President Bush,
these slightly rusty Knights of the Roundtable helped lead the charge
against the accounting reform bill by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.).</LD>
<TE>   In a letter sent to members of Sarbanes' Banking Committee, the
Business Roundtable expressed concern that the bill would "inhibit
the ability of U.S. public corporations to compete, create jobs and
generate economic growth." Note to the 17,000 employees who are the
collateral damage of the accounting-triggered explosion at WorldCom:
Be sure to send your resumes to the Business Roundtable. It's looking
out for you!</TE>
<TE>   Instead of strict new laws, the chief executives came out in favor
of industry self-regulation, "strongly encouraging" all American
companies to adhere to the Roundtable's freshly minted "Principles of
Corporate Governance." These "guiding principles" included calling on
accounting firms to carry out their work "in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards." Generally accepted by whom,
Arthur Andersen?</TE>
<TE>   Then came WorldCom, and the Business Roundtable quickly shifted to
Stage Two--also known as the old "hug and mug." In this PR-savvy
ploy, you reverse your rhetoric, but your goal remains the same:
gutting any prospect for meaningful reform.</TE>
<TE>   So you hit the Sunday morning talk-show circuit, as Roundtable
Chairman John Dillon did this past weekend, and tout your support of
the very bill you were, only weeks before, working so hard to kill.
The idea is to hop on the reform bandwagon, collect the PR points,
then wait for the wheels to come off said bandwagon.</TE>
<TE>   And no one is holding Dillon's or the president's feet to the fire
over their foxhole conversions. After all, Bush is as adept at the
abrupt face-saving about-face as anyone. In his schoolmarmish lecture
to Wall Street, he called for arming the Securities and Exchange
Commission with 100 new enforcement officers--just months after
proposing cutting back the SEC's fraud investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if there is one thing politicians understand, it's
punishment at the polls. And with a tidal wave of public outrage as
powerful as the one currently heading their way, there is a very good
chance that some version of reform will actually make it out of
Congress and go to the president for his signature. In which case,
you can expect the anti-regulation zealots to quickly shift to Stage
Three: accept and reload.</TE>
<TE>   This phase features the tireless search for underhanded ways to
circumvent whatever regulations Congress ends up imposing. Just look
at what happened with campaign finance reform: After years of bloody
congressional battles, supporters were finally able to pass a bill
banning soft-money donations. But never underestimate the
resourcefulness of those looking to maintain the status quo: Last
month, the administration's friends at the Federal Election
Commission took a carving knife to the new regulations, slicing open
loopholes through which millions in soft money can continue to pour
into political party coffers. As they say on K Street, "It ain't over
till the fat cats sing." And you can bet they'll be in full chorus
when it comes to undermining corporate reform.</TE>
<TE>   The devil is in the details--and so is the stabbing in the back of
true reform. Be on the lookout for reformers-come-lately floating
proposals that seem reasonable on the outside (like allowing
shareholders to vote on CEO stock options) but really wouldn't change
a thing (management almost always has enough proxy power to control
the outcome of any such vote).</TE>
<TE>   The enemies of reform will be spending millions of dollars--and
every waking hour--making sure there are enough loopholes in the
small print to keep the pigs gorging at the trough. The only thing
that will make it possible for the handful of real reformers to keep
the corporate swine at bay is public outrage.</TE>

<HD>Anything Goes in a High-Tech, Lowlife Society</HD>
<DH>In a population obsessed with media, 'too gross' is just
right.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happens to the world when everything is permitted? That was the
question asked in 1881 by the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky in
"The Brothers Karamazov" as he brooded over the withdrawal of
traditional religious strictures.</LD>
<LD>   Today, a new god of sorts--technology--ordains the opposite
lesson, proliferating media choices and teaching us to display our
innermost everything--not to heaven but to each other.</LD>
<LD>   And so the battle lines are drawn, between the Most High and high
tech.</LD>
<TE>   Who's winning? One answer can be found on the cover of the July 25
issue of Rolling Stone. There's Ozzy Osbourne, ex-front man for the
rock band Black Sabbath. Once he was notorious for biting off the
head of a bird and for urinating on the Alamo, but now, in the wake
of his huge MTV show "The Osbournes," he has been embraced by the
establishment. He has earned his own star on Hollywood Boulevard,
appeared at the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner and sung for
Queen Elizabeth II at her recent jubilee.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a new film, "Notorious C.H.O.," features the bisexual
misadventures of comedian Margaret Cho. The Korean American comedian
puts her own spin on service to one's country, as when she volunteers
to perform a certain sex act on all the rescue workers at the World
Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   And the New York Post reports that porn star Jenna Jameson has
crossed over into the mainstream; she will be doing ads for Ikea and
has also signed a two-book contract with Reganbooks, an imprint of
the venerable publisher HarperCollins.</TE>
<TE>   Even harder-core stuff is working its way into the culture.
Salon.com takes note, for example, of porn director Lizzie Borden. If
that nom de smut sounds obscurely familiar, that's because the real
Lizzie Borden was accused of hacking her parents to death in Fall
River, Mass., in 1892. But today, as reporter Janelle Brown observes,
"Borden has emerged as a porn powerhouse who manages to offend,
disgust and/or alienate not just feminists, politicians and most
Americans with a conscience, but a great percentage of the
unshockable pornography industry as well."</TE>
<TE>   Brown lists some of Borden's movies, the titles of which can't be
printed here. One concerns geriatric women having sex with younger
men, and a second concerns post-coital women drinking vile
concoctions of vomit and other bodily fluids. Most horrifying, Brown
adds, is the slasher-porno film "Forced Entry."</TE>
<TE>   So maybe everything is permitted nowadays. That was the conclusion
of David Segal, music critic for the Washington Post, after
chronicling the silence of conservative cultural critics in the wake
of new albums from the likes of Eminem, the rapper who rhapsodizes
about murder. "There was a time when an album that imagined
diabolical ways to poison women with anthrax would stir a little
protest," Segal declares, but now the monitors and moralizers have
quietly surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   "They've won," concedes William Bennett, author of "The Book of
Virtues," who now concentrates on fighting foreign terror. "They get
to say and do anything and make billions."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe everything is permitted in the realm of speech and
expression. But isn't such permissiveness cyclical? Won't the
cultural pendulum swing back, someday, to the more chaste and
tasteful? Maybe. But probably not.</TE>
<TE>   Human nature may be cyclical, but technology is linear. Is
television going to revert to three easy-to-police channels? And who
will ever get control of the Internet? Already out of this
multimedia, multichannel environment has come a new ethos of
visibility and transparency, in which people use technology to peer
into everything from their child's nursery to the weather forecast to
the military battlefield. And who knows, perhaps even corporate
financial statements will someday become more scrutable.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the same techno-trends encourage not only discovery but
also new styles of confession and revelation. People display the most
intimate details of their psyches and their physiques, on the Web and
in the flesh, as even the most casual observer of youthful fashion
must have noticed by now.</TE>
<TE>   But is this permissiveness good or bad?</TE>
<TE>   That's an interesting question, but also a moot question, because
the great god of our time, technology--which sees all and lets us see
all--has already announced the answer: Permissiveness is, and will
be.</TE>

<HD>Call a Terrorist a Terrorist</HD>
<DH>In the name of diversity, the government is avoiding
stating the obvious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why is the U.S. government in as much denial about the motives and
label we should apply to Hesham Mohamed Hadayet as the man's clueless
wife, who still can't bring herself to admit he even committed the
crime?</LD>
<LD>   The Egyptian, carrying two handguns and a 6-inch knife, opened
fire at the Israeli national airline's counter at Los Angeles
International Airport on our Independence Day. The FBI has only just
conceded that he probably went into the terminal with the intent to
kill. But the agency still isn't sure what his motives were.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's top investigators are still weighing whether the
shooting might have been a work dispute, a personal argument or,
alas, perhaps a hate crime.</LD>
<TE>   This willful ignorance toward terrorists in our midst is not new.
As Middle East Forum Director Daniel Pipes pointed out, Hadayet's
crime "fits a well-established pattern," and a disturbing one.</TE>
<TE>   There was Rashid Baz, the Lebanese who opened fire on a van of
Hassidic Jews in New York City in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI called that "road rage."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was a Palestinian professor from Gaza City, Ali Hasan
Abu Kamal, who shot seven tourists--killing one--on top of the Empire
State Building. He was classified as a "deranged individual working
on his own."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there was Gamil El Batouty, the Egypt Air copilot who
crashed a plane full of passengers leaving John F. Kennedy Airport in
1999. Egyptian pressure forced the National Transportation Safety
Board to shy away from mentioning terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   So why all the denial? Because Hadayet, like Batouty, Kamal and
Baz, is getting lost in the politically correct fog in part created
by a word that has surfaced more than once with regard to the LAX
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Upon hearing the news of the attack, Gov. Gray Davis remarked:
"Like all Californians, I am outraged and deeply saddened to learn of
today's shooting.... That it happened on the day on which we honor
what America stands for--liberty, security and diversity--makes this
particularly more tragic."</TE>
<TE>   The operative word here is, of course, "diversity." Interestingly
enough, it appeared again in discussions of the LAX incident when the
press reported that Hadayet had been allowed to stay in this country
when his wife was granted permanent residency through the Department
of State's Diversity Lottery Program.</TE>
<TE>   The political power of diversity is threatening to blind us to the
very real terrorist threat in our midst, and all because it has
created an atmosphere in which law enforcement agencies, including
the admittedly often incompetent FBI, would sooner bend over backward
to exonerate a person of Middle Eastern descent than be accused of
racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Like a strangely reverse paranoid glasnost, the diversity
orthodoxy on matters of race existed well before Sept. 11, but it
certainly has worsened since. The attacks were followed by months of
debate about whether one man's terrorist was another man's freedom
fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder then that we don't know a terrorist when we see
one or can't bring ourselves to label him as such for fear of, as New
York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof recently said, "pick[ing] up
racist and xenophobic threads that are some of the sorriest chapters
in our history"?</TE>
<TE>   This has resulted in a willful blindness to a very real local
threat, and all for fear of the powerful stigma now attached to
anyone who advocates stricter immigration codes.</TE>
<TE>   Diversity is and always has been a distinctively American practice
of which we should be proud. But whether we admit it or not, we are
at war with terrorists, and it is not a one-sided war. The troops are
marshaling on the other side, and as we have seen all too often of
late, they are mostly surfacing behind enemy lines in our backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Denial at this point is suicide, and, for now, blind slavishness
to some vacuous ideal of diversity is a luxury we cannot afford.</TE>

<HD>Egypt's Veil Over Freedom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Egypt's foreign minister said several weeks ago that his nation was
"trying to build a liberal democratic system in difficult
circumstances" and it was not easy. The government of President Hosni
Mubarak, apparently intent on keeping his autocratic rule safe, is no
help.</LD>
<LD>   The day before his June trip to Washington, Mubarak signed a law
imposing tougher restrictions on nongovernmental organizations, the
nonprofit institutions that can play valuable roles in helping
countries increase political freedoms. Groups specializing in
everything from improving children's health care to teaching new
agricultural techniques can help villagers organize, articulate needs
and become advocates to government agencies. But the new law does not
just regulate organizations, it imposes so many restrictions as to
make them dependent on the government for nearly all their
operations. Now there can be no truly independent groups of this sort
in Egypt.</LD>
<TE>   Mubarak took office after the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981
and imposed a state of emergency that has not been lifted since.
During the 1980s and '90s, terrorists proclaiming fealty to Islamic
fundamentalism did threaten Egypt, killing police, government
officials and tourists. The government responded with massive
arrests, supported by its citizens, and with torture and executions.
The threats seem largely over now, with onetime terrorists either in
exile or renouncing violence.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has some leverage to push for progress. It has
been a major aid donor since Egypt recognized Israel during the
Carter administration. U.S. officials say Egypt was quick to respond
after the Sept. 11 attacks and allowed military access to Egyptian
airspace and the Suez Canal.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights campaigners are critical of Washington for not
pushing Cairo harder to liberalize, however. Rather than being a
model, they say, the U.S. responded to terrorism by imitating Egypt
in making massive arrests and detaining suspects without charging
them. Some of those criticisms are overblown, but Egyptian officials
are quick to boast to visiting Americans that they confronted
terrorism long ago and defeated it.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Mubarak may face a serious challenge from Islamic
parties if he allows free elections. But encouraging the
establishment of local advocacy groups and letting them speak out on
political matters can be a safety valve. Egypt remains the
intellectual center of the Arab world, and its influence extends far
beyond its borders. It should clear the way for forming
steppingstones toward democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Sadat is remembered for making peace with Israel; Mubarak should
aim for another broad legacy: putting Egypt on the road to democracy.</TE>

<HD>A Hot Flash on the Good Life</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Feminine forever. That was the sizzle that first sold millions of
menopausal women on estrogen pills in the 1960s. This fountain of
youth in a bottle would keep women from becoming "dull and
unattractive," according to one of its early pitchmen, and make them
"much more pleasant to live with."</LD>
<LD>   Who could resist? What woman would choose to shrivel and sag when
she could remain dewy and pert by popping a pill? Who wouldn't rather
avoid the drenching night sweats, embarrassing hot flashes and mood
swings?</LD>
<LD>   The 1960s were, after all, an era of medical miracles. The birth
control pill, for example, unleashed a sexual revolution and allowed
women to choose, as they never could before, when or if they would
become pregnant.</LD>
<TE>   No wonder many women and their doctors came to regard aging,
menopause in particular, as a perilous emotional and physical
passage, a disease that could be medicated away. Heart disease,
stroke, osteoporosis--until this week many physicians believed that
estrogen could keep the grim reaper at bay.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday, scientists abruptly ended a large national study on
hormone replacement therapy after concluding that the regimen did
more harm than good. The government-funded trial, which tracked
16,608 women taking either estrogen and progestin or a placebo, was
halted after it became clear that the drugs caused a slight but
significant increase in the risk of breast cancer, heart attacks,
blood clots and strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Six million American women who until this week had been taking the
drugs now have new fears.</TE>
<TE>   It's too facile to see the story of hormone replacement therapy as
one of drug companies and physicians putting something over on
gullible women. It's also a story of women who took these drugs,
sometimes for decades, because they--along with the men in their
lives--equated femininity and sexuality with youth and nubility. And
it's the story of women who simply sought relief from the
sometimes-debilitating symptoms of menopause and hoped to prevent
catastrophic hip fractures and heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The silver lining to this week's news, if there is one, is that
women's medical issues, too long ignored, now finally command the
attention of researchers. Also more visible is an emerging acceptance
of menopause and aging.</TE>
<TE>   Like other health issues once discussed only in embarrassed
whispers, menopause has in recent years become the subject of comedy
sketches and talk show confessionals, generating a cottage industry
of support groups and products. As of Tuesday, it was also dinner-
table conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The new developments underscore what most women knew all along:
that aging is inevitable, that there is no magic pill to stop the
clock. Vigorous middle and later years--what Anne Morrow Lindbergh
called "the flowering that waits for afternoon"--are likely to rest
on the basics: a healthful diet, regular exercise and a life of
meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's a hot flash.</TE>

<HD>Facing the Smallpox Threat</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember the "Cipro panic" that spread across the United States in
October after a Florida photo editor died of inhalation anthrax?
Americans not only bought all of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin on U.S.
shelves, many crossed the Mexican and Canadian borders and emptied
pharmacy shelves there too.</LD>
<LD>   A trace of such anxiety reemerged Wednesday when an academic
journal published a study questioning a Bush administration interim
policy, under which smallpox vaccinations would be made available to
health workers and others likely to be in close contact with infected
people before the general population.</LD>
<LD>   The authors, principally Edward H. Kaplan of the Yale School of
Management, raised doubts about this so-called ring vaccination
strategy. In today's densely populated, mobile society, the authors
contended, ring vaccinations could allow a larger outbreak that would
take longer to control and spawn more panic than a mass vaccination.</LD>
<TE>   But despite the study's assertions, there is much to be said for
the administration's approach to managing a smallpox epidemic. This
month, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson plans to
give a speech outlining the administration's strategy. There are
three facts he should highlight to reassure the public and answer the
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   First, there is no shortage of the vaccine. The government has 100
million doses in its stockpiles and expects to have a dose for every
U.S. resident by early next year. Second, there is broad support in
the public health sector for the ring strategy. Finally, Kaplan's
study was based on mathematical models, not tested real-world
observations.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson still has much more to do to protect the nation against
smallpox, which is probably a much greater threat than anthrax. There
is abundant evidence that at least three nations--the former Soviet
Union, Iraq and North Korea--created and possibly sold potent strains
of smallpox for use as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson should give states--which must devise their own smallpox
management plans by October--guidance in weighing the benefits of
mass vaccinations against risks including recently vaccinated people
transmitting the disease and the vaccine itself seriously harming
some people with weak immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   To its credit, the administration has not dismissed the real
threat that smallpox poses. But with public health systems in tatters
in many cities and counties, including Los Angeles, stockpiling
vaccine is only a start.</TE>

<LD>After listening to President Bush's prescriptions for corporate
reform in his speech Tuesday, I was reminded of "Porgy and Bess,"
with its memorable song whose lyrics begin, "I've got plenty of
nothin', and nothin's plenty for me." Too bad. The president had a
chance to demand some harsh remedies from Congress with specific
recommendations for real reform but instead simply reiterated
platitudes, which even Wall Street found inadequate, as the Dow Jones
continued on its downward path after the speech. The Securities and
Exchange Commission budget needs doubling, and Bush should have
backed the strong Senate bill instead of the tepid reforms in the
bill passed by the House.</LD>

<TE>   George W. Bush was a miserably failed businessman, adrift in
midlife, post-prep self-indulgence, when he was able to buy into
and--for a tiny minority stake--become president of a Major League
baseball team, the Texas Rangers. Through the club he acquired
exposure; through its sale, wealth outrageously disproportionate to
his investment; and through both, a minor governorship in a major
state. Out of that state are now coming criminal fraud investigations
involving old friends, donors, the vice president and possibly even
the president himself, as a stock sale needed to repay the loan used
to buy the Rangers was reported eight months late and may have been
tainted by insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is now publicly appealing for laws to rein in the excess of
corporate vandals, when his very existence as a public figure is the
consequence of the assistance and generosity of just such
men--wealthy friends of his father and others who gave early and
often with the dream of raising up the most mediocre of their own so
that they could one day run free to excess. The big Fox is not across
the border in Mexico, folks. He's right here in the henhouse.</TE>

<TE>   All Bush's tough speech on chief executives cleaning up their act
says: "Don't get caught. Look at me. Ten years ago I unloaded more
than $800,000 worth of Harken stock while I was on the board of
directors a few days before the news got to the public that we were
in trouble, and lookie--they can't touch me. Nevertheless, I urge you
dear contributing CEOs to be more careful. GWB, yer ol' buddy boy."</TE>

<TE>   President Bush's announcement of an impending crackdown on
corporate crime is long overdue. But it should come as no surprise
that financial improprieties and legal evasions are rife in
white-collar America. Legally, we treat corporations as persons, and
yet the corporate structure, with its bureaucratic divisions of
labor, makes personal responsibility difficult to assign and easy to
avoid.</TE>

<TE>   Robert Scheer is at it again (Commentary, July 9). A completely
one-sided liberal attack on our president. Perhaps Scheer could write
a column on Terry McAuliffe's clairvoyance in selling Global Crossing
stock before it collapsed. I'm sure that he could come up with a
plausible explanation for McAuliffe's turning, what, $100,000 into
nearly $18 million. Naturally, the chairman of the Democratic
National Committee was just lucky or possibly he "went to school" on
Hillary Rodham Clinton's investing expertise. Scheer's columns reek
of political mudslinging at its worst.</TE>

<TE>   In taking the 5th Amendment, the [former chief] executive of
WorldCom reinforced a situation where it may be inferred that he has
something to hide (July 9). If the president is serious about
restoring faith in the economic system, he should immediately order a
full-scale investigation of these individuals, with no expense spared
in discovering by legitimate means whether or not they are hiding
criminal behavior. If proven guilty, nothing less than a lengthy jail
sentence and significant fine would be appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Any other response from the president would indicate he is once
again playing games and hoping that rhetoric will be an accepted
replacement for action.</TE>

<LD>For the horrible crime of an expired registration, a 16-year-old
passenger ends up being handcuffed, thrown onto the trunk of a car
and slugged by a cowardly cop easily 50 pounds heavier, with three
other cops surrounding him. The only reason this comes to light is a
videotape (July 9).</LD>
<LD>   The four of them would have lied to the "impartial" investigation
by the internal affairs departments that are actually set up to
protect these creatures, or to the district attorneys and court
system, which are scared to death of finding them guilty.</LD>
<LD>   When have we had enough, folks? When it happens to you? Civilian
oversight, just as our military has, is the only chance we have
against these criminals. By the way, the officer is on leave--with
pay.</LD>

the badges?</TE>

<TE>   It is becoming extremely difficult for law enforcement officers to
do their job. They are under intense public scrutiny and are required
to be in complete control of their actions at all times.
Unfortunately, those in society who reject authority and live a life
of crime are not held to the same standards. They are allowed every
conceivable excuse for their actions. Perhaps it is time that we
extend the same leniency to our police and sheriffs.</TE>
<TE>   I propose the institution of a "three strikes and you're fired"
policy for law enforcement officers who are found guilty of abusing a
suspect while in custody. Here is how the policy would work: The
officer is disciplined and given a 90-day probationary sentence;
during this time, the officer continues receiving his salary and is
enrolled in an anger management course.</TE>
<TE>   He is also provided with training to improve his skills at
subduing a suspect who is both hellbent on resisting arrest and
intent on injuring the officer in the process. Upon the second
offense, probation extends to six months, and more training is
provided. Again, the salary should not be interrupted. Upon the third
strike, it is reasonable to conclude that the officer in question is
not capable of restraining himself and should be dismissed, with
pension.</TE>

<TE>   Reading and watching the reports about Donovan Jackson, who was
beaten by an Inglewood police officer, I was dismayed to hear that
the officer's actions were being rationalized by what the
sensationalized video did not capture. While the handcuffed suspect
may have assaulted the police officers, nothing gives them the right
to treat the suspect as they did after he had been handcuffed.</TE>

<TE>   It's a shame that Officer Jeremy Morse didn't gently lift Jackson
off the ground, pat him on the head and send him on his way, even
though Jackson had just fought with Morse and left him bleeding. Then
no one would protest, and The Times certainly wouldn't care. Can't we
all just get along?</TE>

<LD>Re "Mural Repair Grant Stops Short of Need," July 4: Mural artist
Glenna Avila supports Gov. Gray Davis' $1.7-million grant to repair
graffiti-marred murals and has stated, "I'm sure that everybody is
100% behind fixing these works." While Avila may be skilled with a
paintbrush, she certainly doesn't speak for me.</LD>
<LD>   If our financially astute governor does go through with these
repairs, his name should be etched along each mural. That way, when
millions of future commuters are stuck northbound on the freeway and
see a fresh round of gang tags fouling up the Los Angeles Marathon
mural, they'll know exactly who flushed close to $2 million of their
hard-earned tax dollars down the toilet.</LD>

<TE>   It saddens me that the murals have been ruined by graffiti. No
amount of money spent to replace them can assure that they will not
be defaced again.</TE>
<TE>   I pass by a storage building on the east side of the 405 Freeway
near Westwood. Every day there is graffiti on the roof. The next day
it is painted out, only to be vandalized again and again.</TE>
<TE>   Until measures can assure the safety of the murals, they are at
risk, and the money to replace them is wasted. Very sad.</TE>

<LD>Many years ago I took my son, who was 9 years old at the time, to a
baseball card show in Orange County. There were many professional
ballplayers attending, pushing their products and egos. Some were not
patient with the many kids and adults who were so enamored of their
heroes.</LD>
<LD>   Ted Williams (obituary, July 6) took his time with his many fans,
posed for pictures and just enjoyed himself. He may have been made
out of super-steel, but I could see a kind heart in this amazing man.</LD>

<TE>   One of my favorite Ted Williams stories occurred during an
interview in 1992. A reporter asked, "If you were playing today, do
you think you could hit .400?"</TE>
<TE>   Williams replied, "No, I'd probably hit around .350."</TE>
<TE>   The reporter asked: "Why? Because the pitchers playing today are
better than when you were in your prime?"</TE>
<TE>   Williams responded: "No. Because I'm now 73 years old!"</TE>

Williams to literally give a cold shoulder to the Boston fans!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Battle in a Time of Peace," July 7: In a time of the epidemic
spread of AIDS in southern Africa, prevention efforts focused on
promoting condom use are grossly inadequate. Rampant sexual misuse of
women and girls is a major cause of the spread of this epidemic in
Africa. With prostitution and promiscuity commonplace, men have
little incentive to remain monogamous and are free to enjoy serial
sex with multiple partners. Women are forced into compliance for
economic or social reasons, and the recipe is complete for a sexual
epidemic.</LD>
<LD>   Monogamous marriage has proven to be the best protection against
sexually transmitted diseases. But in our sexually amoral Western
culture it is not politically correct to teach this truth, so a
second-rate prevention is taught. So we say, "Always use a condom--if
you have one." But never, "Marry, be faithful, and you will be well."
So Africans suffer and die from AIDS with little hope of change. They
deserve better.</LD>

<HD>ExxonMobil Plans Early MTBE Halt</HD>
<DH>Environment: Largest oil firm says it will replace the gas
additive with ethanol by the first part of 2003, sooner than Gov.
Davis' revised deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ExxonMobil Corp. will phase out a potential cancer-causing chemical
from its California gasoline one year ahead of a state deadline, the
company said Wednesday. The world's largest petroleum company joins
three major oil firms that have committed to removing MTBE from their
gas.</LD>
<LD>   "In keeping with our commitment to providing California consumers
with gasoline that meets the state's environmental standards, we will
phase out MTBE and convert to ethanol by early 2003," said Prem Nair,
a spokeswoman in the company's Fairfax, Va., office.</LD>
<LD>   MTBE, or methyl tertiary-butyl ether, is added to gasoline to make
it burn cleaner, reducing air pollution. Using MTBE was common in the
1990s, but research showed it is a probable carcinogen, spreading
quickly through groundwater.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, Gov. Gray Davis announced a phaseout of the chemical by
the end of 2002. But earlier this year, he delayed the ban a year
because of concerns about gasoline shortages and price increases.</TE>
<TE>   Still, BP Amoco, Shell Oil Co. and Philips Petroleum Co. committed
to removing MTBE from California gasoline by the end of the year,
which would mean that 60% of the state's gasoline would be MTBE-free
by early 2003. Gasoline refiners must add an oxygenate because of the
federal Clean Air Act, and will replace MTBE with ethanol, which is
made from corn.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists praised the move.</TE>
<TE>   "ExxonMobil has clearly decided that MTBE is no longer worth the
liability and public-relations risk," said Brooke Coleman, director
of the Renewable Energy Action Project, a San Francisco-based
environmental group that has been pressuring oil companies to phase
out MTBE earlier than the new deadline. "Californians will now have
the ability to choose MTBE-free fuel in 2003. That's good news for
our drinking-water supplies."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who was disturbed by Davis' delay of the ban, said the
oil companies' actions prove the governor was more concerned about
reelection than about pollution and potential health hazards. "Gov.
Davis was worried about politics first and, in this case, drinking
water second," Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   A Davis administration spokesman said that's not the case, and the
phaseout delay was driven by the governor's concerns about smaller
oil producers, who are going to have a harder time setting up the
infrastructure to import ethanol from the Midwest and distribute it
throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be the smaller refiners ... which are going to be
most problematic in terms of making the switch-over," said William L.
Rukeyser, assistant secretary of the California Environmental
Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "You have very different market dynamics if you have companies
making their own decision versus the entire industry having to make
the switch-over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman said ExxonMobil's announcement leaves San Francisco-based
ChevronTexaco Corp., the nation's second-largest oil company, as the
only major producer that hasn't committed to an early phaseout of the
additive. Spokeswoman Nicole Hodgson said the company is still
working on infrastructure, permitting and transportation issues.</TE>

<HD>3rd Fund Created for Victim's Family</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A third fund has been established for the family of Yaakov Aminov,
one of the victims of the July 4 shootings at the El Al Israel
Airlines ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Aminov's wife, Anat, is expecting their sixth child. Aminov, of
Valley Village, also was the father of three children from a previous
marriage. The five youngest children range in age from 1 to 9.</LD>
<LD>   Friends said Aminov, 46, a diamond importer who owned a jewelry
distribution company in downtown Los Angeles, was the family's sole
financial support.</LD>
<TE>   "[Anat Aminov] is struggling with the idea that she is now a
single mother of five children," said Rabbi Aron Tendler, who has
known the family for several years. "The money will help pay for the
children's long-term education and other needs."</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends established the third fund this week, Tendler
said. All three funds eventually will be combined and overseen by a
single administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Donations can be made to the Aminov Fund/Anat Aminov account, Bank
of America, Valley Plaza Branch, 6600 Laurel Canyon Blvd., North
Hollywood, CA 91607.</TE>
<TE>   Two bank accounts previously were opened at Bank Leumi, 16530
Ventura Blvd., Encino, CA 91436; and National Bank of California,
14724 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, CA 91403.</TE>
<TE>   Two synagogues also will forward contributions to the family: Yad
Avraham synagogue, 12426 Burbank Blvd., North Hollywood, CA 91607;
and Shaarey Zedek synagogue, 12800 Chandler Blvd., Valley Village, CA
91607.</TE>
<TE>   A fund also has been established in memory of Victoria Hen, 25, of
Chatsworth, a second victim in the LAX shooting. Contributions may be
made to the Vicky Hen Memorial Fund at any Wells Fargo Bank, account
No. 1014243982.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Knoller, a spokesman for the Hen family, said the fund will
be used to establish a children's library in the San Fernando Valley
in Victoria's name.</TE>

<HD>New Hotline Encourages Use of Safe Havens for Unwanted
Infants</HD>

<LD>Los Angeles County officials have launched a toll-free, multilingual
hotline in hopes of encouraging women considering abandoning their
newborns to drop off their babies at safe havens.</LD>
<LD>   The hotline, with 40 operators providing help in more than 160
languages, was prompted by the abandonment of five babies within a
month, three of whom died. The most recent body was found Tuesday
morning at a Carson recycling center. The two others who died were
dumped in the City of Industry and Walnut Park.</LD>
<LD>   The Safe Haven Hotline, (877) 725-5111, is open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.</LD>
<TE>   Operators will advise mothers on their legal rights and refer them
to the closest hospitals that will accept their babies. They also
refer the mothers to counseling and other public services.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a "safe haven" law that took effect last year, allowing
parents to drop off newborns at hospital emergency rooms within 72
hours of birth without fear of prosecution, only two babies in Los
Angeles County have been turned over since January 2001, officials
said. Twenty-three infants have been abandoned since that time; 14 of
them were found dead.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, however, eight babies have been safely surrendered,
said Blanca Castro, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Social
Services. Statistics on the numbers of babies abandoned in the state
are not readily available.</TE>
<TE>   "These women are not being prosecuted, and the babies are being
moved for adoption," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Safe Haven for Abandoned Newborns Task Force are
working on broadening the law to include fire stations and health
clinics as safe havens.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday afternoon, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies
released a composite sketch of a woman suspected of dumping her
infant daughter at a Walnut Park recycling center July 2. The baby's
body was found on a conveyer belt at Best Way Recycling by workers
separating trash. Authorities believe the baby was dumped at a Kmart
at Vermont and Slauson avenues, said Lt. Ray Peavy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so hard to accept or understand. I can't even visualize
a baby on a [conveyer] belt," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Don
Knabe.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses at Kmart reported seeing a woman named "Trish" or
"Tisha" in a restroom stall with blood on the floor, Peavy said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman is described as being between her late teens and early
30s, about 5 feet 1, and weighing about 240 pounds. She has a
medium-to-dark complexion, short dark hair and dark eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information may call deputies at (323) 890-5500.</TE>

<HD>City Council Votes Against Billboard Removal Payment</HD>
<DH>Decision: Board rejects company's $15.6-million demand for
signs coming down in street overhaul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday unanimously rejected a
billboard company's demand for $15.6 million in compensation for
tearing down a dozen billboards on Santa Monica Boulevard on the
Westside.</LD>
<LD>   The ads, located on publicly owned medians, are to be removed as
part of a $69-million plan to turn the main road and Little Santa
Monica Boulevard into one wide, tree-lined thoroughfare between
Century City and the San Diego Freeway. The company, Clear Channel
Outdoor, has rented billboard space on patches of an old railroad
right of way on a monthly basis for decades.</LD>
<LD>   Meeting in closed session, the council also voted 13 to 0 to
reject the firm's alternate proposal to relocate the 12 billboards
elsewhere in the city and accept $3.5 million in compensation.
Earlier this year, the council eliminated new billboards within city
limits.</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss said he found the company's behavior
"galling."</TE>
<TE>   "They have benefited for decades from a month-to-month opportunity
at the crossroads of the commercial world in Los Angeles," he said.
"The fact that they're not content with that extraordinary
opportunity is galling."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel officials said they hoped to continue discussions
with the city.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a taking of personal property. That requires a payment,"
said George Manyak, western regional president for Clear Channel
Outdoor. "I would hope there would be more negotiations rather than
going to a legal process, but we're fully prepared to [sue]."</TE>
<TE>   Manyak added that there is precedent for compensation in similar
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski strongly disagreed with the
company's claims. During the council meeting before the closed
session, she cited a recent court decision involving a similar claim
on billboards near Los Angeles International Airport. The city "won
overwhelmingly," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, "they were 30-day leases--month to month. We can
give them 30 days' notice," she said. "They are entitled to 30 days,"
nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   The city has reached a separate agreement with Viacom Outdoors to
take down its two billboards in the area this fall, officials on both
sides said. Terms of that deal were not released.</TE>
<TE>   The road overhaul, paid for by a combination of local, state and
federal money, is expected to begin in January. The combination of
the main road popularly known as Big Santa Monica Boulevard and
Little Santa Monica Boulevard will be a massive undertaking, with
construction expected to take at least two years. The result will be
a landscaped roadway that can handle up to 20% more traffic.</TE>

<HD>Local Colleges Get a Strong Credit Rating</HD>
<DH>Education: Some feared that complaints of excessive
spending by the district chancellor would jack up the interest on a
$365-million bond that voters passed in March.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite controversy swirling around Chancellor Philip Westin's
spending practices, the Ventura County Community College District
received a strong credit rating Wednesday on a voter-approved
$365-million bond that will be used for improvements at the
district's three campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's Investors Service granted the district an "Aa3" bond
rating, a slightly above-average rating for community college
districts and one considered "very strong" for municipal bonds, said
Kevork Khrimian, vice president and senior analyst at Moody's in New
York.</LD>
<LD>   The rating should keep borrowing costs at under 5%, said Robert
Barna, an L.A.-based investment banker representing the district.</LD>
<TE>   Calling the Moody's rating "wonderful news," Westin acknowledged
his concern that recent accusations of excessive spending by him
could translate into a higher lending rate for the college district.</TE>
<TE>   Westin has been the source of public outrage for ringing up more
than $119,000 in business-related expenses from 1997 to 2001. Some
critics have called for his resignation, saying they never would have
voted for the bond if they had known about the chancellor's spending
habits.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his troubles, Westin said the strong bond rating was a
victory for the college district.</TE>
<TE>   "This bond is the most important thing for this district, in my
opinion, since the district was founded, and I didn't want anything
to jeopardize that," he said. "With this bond, we'll be able to fix
all of our facilities' needs throughout the county for the next
30-plus years."</TE>
<TE>   Khrimian said the bond rating is based largely on Ventura County's
strong and diverse economic base, and residents' relatively high
income levels. Interest on general obligation bonds is paid by
assessments to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's was expected to release its bond rating later
this week. The college district plans to take the first phase of the
financing plan--$105 million--to market during the week of July 29.</TE>
<TE>   Khrimian said district officials were upfront about the Westin
controversy and that Moody's also conducted its own research. He said
the bond-rating agency determined that the chancellor's problems
would not affect the district's long-term finances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a credit factor," Khrimian said. "It does not have a
bearing on the district's willingness and ability to pay back bond
holders."</TE>
<TE>   County voters approved the bond in the March 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   The day after, the college board of trustees received a detailed
report of Westin's expenditures and asked for his resignation. The
board then reversed itself, deciding instead to conduct its own
audit.</TE>
<TE>   When the study revealed no criminal wrongdoing, the trustees voted
4 to 1 to renew Westin's contract through 2006. They also awarded him
a 16% raise, bringing his salary to $203,000.</TE>
<TE>   Khrimian said the trustees' renewal of Westin's contract instilled
confidence among Wall Street analysts that there was trust and
stability in the district.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been rehired," Khrimian said. "He's gotten a four-year
contract since then. So it all seems to be water under the bridge."</TE>
<TE>   Westin's troubles are not quite over, however. The board of
trustees has called a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to discuss the
chancellor's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the trustees were to fire Westin or ask for his
resignation, Khrimian said, it would not affect Moody's rating.</TE>

<HD>Midnight Special Bidding the Promenade Farewell</HD>
<DH>Institution: Patrons lament the bookstore's planned move
from the Third Street district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a little more than two decades, Midnight Special Bookstore has
achieved the status of a cultural institution in Santa Monica. So its
many patrons were saddened and surprised as word spread this week
that the store is leaving the Third Street Promenade.</LD>
<LD>   At Midnight Special, bestsellers include titles such as Noam
Chomsky's "9-11," Karl Marx's "Communist Manifesto" and copies of the
U.S. Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   Poets gather in the store's community room every Friday for
open-mike nights. And local activists hold screenings of independent
films and controversial documentaries.</LD>
<TE>   The store's owner, Margie Ghiz, said she's been getting calls and
e-mails from customers since she made the announcement last week. On
Wednesday morning, customers were stopping into the store to express
their disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so sad that it's leaving," said Julie Hetherington, 65, of
Laguna Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   Ghiz, 62, smiled and nodded her head. "Thanks for the support,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope you all stay in Santa Monica," said Hetherington's
shopping companion, Mary Kay Howie, 62, also of Laguna Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I can control that," Ghiz said. "I only have so
many options."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica, a town long known for its liberal politics, will
lose a piece of its character when the store moves later this year,
Mayor Michael Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade of paying reduced rent, the store owner is being
asked to leave the 5,000-square-foot shop in the heart of Santa
Monica's busy downtown pedestrian mall so the landlord can bring in a
tenant who can afford to pay more.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a devastating loss of a unique cultural institution,"
Feinstein said Tuesday. "This is one of the best political and
countercultural bookstores anywhere. Simply having this store here
brings people [to Santa Monica] who like to read and enjoy the free
exchange of ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Sandee Mirell, a regular patron from Manhattan Beach, heard the
news when she stopped at the bookstore during her lunch break
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we have this bookstore here," said Mirell,
59, sitting on a footstool while flipping through a copy of Bell
Hooks' "All About Love."</TE>
<TE>   The Promenade "has nothing for people my age," she said as teenage
girls, often with boyfriends in tow, walked down the Promenade.
"Everything else here looks about the same. This is the only place
where you can find diversity."</TE>
<TE>   Mirell said she wouldn't visit the Promenade if she didn't work as
a professional development consultant for one of its tenants. Many
times during her lunch break, she said, she stops at Midnight
Special, browses the shelves for new titles and settles down on the
hardwood floors in the narrow aisles.</TE>
<TE>   Another patron, recording engineer Jamie Lusk, said, "The national
chains are all over the place. [Midnight Special] adds a political
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Ghiz announced Friday in an e-mail to her customers and a network
of independent bookstore owners throughout Southern California that
after 10 years at its present location, Midnight Special would have
to move.</TE>
<TE>   Since the store opened, landlord Walter Marks Jr. has subsidized
the rent, even paying for renovations to the facade and installing
ceiling-high bookshelves.</TE>
<TE>   But earlier this year, Marks and his family, who also own seven
other properties throughout the county, decided they no longer could
afford to subsidize the shop.</TE>
<TE>   The family, which makes up Walter N. Marks Inc., needed to cover
the debt it accumulated after renovating the 100,000-square-foot
Helms Bakery building in Culver City, Marks said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Marks met with Ghiz and told her of the company's
decision: They would raise her rent to match the current market value
of about $10 per square foot. Ghiz said she previously had been
paying about 20% to 25% of market value.</TE>
<TE>   The store has not been given a deadline to move, but Ghiz hopes to
be out by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The bookstore won't be the only independent outlet to leave the
Promenade. Over the years, several family-owned coffeehouses that
once lined the shopping center have been forced to close or move.</TE>
<TE>   A few businesses not connected to national chains carry on, such
as Hennessey &amp; Ingalls, an independent bookstore that specializes in
art and architecture.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always questioning whether it is worth it to pay a premium
to be in the Promenade," said the store's manager, Douglas Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Feinstein noted that the Aero Theater, an independent
one-screen movie house minutes from the Promenade, competes with
several multiplexes in the immediate area.</TE>
<TE>   "I think despite the challenges we're facing, our community does a
very good job of fighting to maintain its uniqueness and its
diversity," Feinstein said. "I don't think we've lost everything. But
each piece that leaves hurts."</TE>
<TE>   As for Midnight Special, Feinstein said city officials are working
with the Bayside District Corp.--a city-funded nonprofit that manages
the Promenade--to find a new location for the store.</TE>
<TE>   Ghiz has scouted locations in Westwood, on Melrose Avenue and near
USC for a new home, but has not found space that is affordable and
large enough to accommodate the store's inventory and community
meeting room.</TE>
<TE>   Midnight Special originally opened in Venice in 1970 as a meeting
place for young people interested in alternative views on American
history, literature and politics in the midst of the Vietnam War and
the civil rights movement. It moved to a small shop on the Promenade
in 1980 and to its current home 12 years later.</TE>
<TE>   Ghiz volunteered with more than a dozen others to run the shop in
its early days. It was a communal endeavor, she said. As the store
first settled into the Promenade, the group decided that Ghiz would
assume ownership, "as a kind of steward," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ghiz would rather not describe herself as the "owner."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a caretaker ... no, a facilitator," she said. "The bookstore
was up and running before I came into the picture."</TE>
<TE>   The store will stay open, Ghiz said. She's just not sure where.</TE>

<HD>Buena Park Chief Asks Fireworks Sales Ban</HD>
<DH>Safety: City posts reward for information about the death
of a boy shot while watching a display.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buena Park's police chief on Wednesday called for a ban on fireworks
sales in the city, citing a chaotic Fourth of July that he said could
have contributed to the death of a 9-year-old boy hit by a falling
bullet.</LD>
<LD>   Xavier Morales of Anaheim was struck by a .22- or .25-caliber
bullet as he watched fireworks with family and friends at a local
park. Police suspect the bullet was fired into the air by someone
nearby.</LD>
<LD>   Buena Park is one of five Orange County cities that allow the sale
of fireworks. Police Chief Gary Hicken said this has made the city a
holiday magnet for residents from nearby communities, where such
fireworks are prohibited. In addition to setting off legal "safe and
sane" fireworks, some people also exploded illegal varieties, such as
bottle rockets, police said.</LD>
<TE>   "The pandemonium from the legal as well as illegal in the area
made it possible for someone to shoot the gun and kill this little
boy without being discovered because of the atmosphere in the park,"
Hicken said.</TE>
<TE>   Buena Park police received more than 130 calls about fireworks on
the holiday. "We were barely able to keep up from call to call. It
was out of control," Hicken said. There have always been problems, he
said, "but it has escalated every year."</TE>
<TE>   Police announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of whoever fired the fatal shot.</TE>
<TE>   Buena Park police and a Los Angeles County sheriff's crime search
team found the small-caliber bullet Monday nine feet from where
Xavier was thought to have been shot, said Sgt. Rich Pena.</TE>
<TE>   Three vehicles parked nearby were also hit by gunfire. Police are
investigating the case as a homicide. Officials hope to find someone
who videotaped the Boisseranc Park fireworks or who witnessed shots
being fired.</TE>
<TE>   The reward money will come from Buena Park's general fund and was
approved by Mayor Patsy Marshall and the City Council late Tuesday
night, said Pena.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to catch whoever did it," said Xavier's 17
year-old brother, Arturo, with tears in his eyes. "It wouldn't make
me feel any better ... because it won't bring my brother back, but
just to know that it won't happen again, at least from that person,
would help that much."</TE>

<HD>2nd Santa Clarita Brush Fire Contained</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brush fire sparked by a burning car in Santa Clarita was fully
contained Wednesday morning after charring more than 60 acres and
threatening homes, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   And on the third consecutive day of brush fires in northern Los
Angeles County, two new fires burned 12 acres near the Golden State
Freeway and Smokey Bear Road, north of Pyramid Lake, a Los Angeles
County Fire Department spokesman said. Two lanes of the freeway were
closed for a short time while firefighters put out the flames,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze in Santa Clarita, the second there in two days, began
Tuesday when three men driving north on the Golden State Freeway
stopped on the shoulder near Calgrove Boulevard because of car
trouble, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Andrew Hernandez said.</LD>
<TE>   "The vehicle caught fire and the winds carried the fire to the
nearby shrubbery and right through the canyon," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Freeway traffic was backed up for hours, and firefighters asked
dozens of residents to voluntarily evacuate the area, though no homes
were damaged, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A fire Monday near the Antelope Valley Freeway in Santa Clarita
burned 300 acres, destroyed one residence and damaged several
backyards before it was contained, county Fire Capt. Brian Jordan
said.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was caused by a discarded cigarette, Jordan said, adding
that an investigation is underway to determine whether the fire had
been set.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said that because of hot and dry conditions, 25 additional
firefighters have been stationed in Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we get rain, we're expecting fires," he said.</TE>

<HD>Suspect Becomes Ill Over Gruesome Testimony</HD>
<DH>Hearing: A recess is called after a detective recounts the
Ventura murder defendant's description to authorities of the slaying
of Nichole Hendrix.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder defendant Bridget Callahan became ill during gruesome
testimony at her preliminary hearing Wednesday, prompting a two-hour
recess.</LD>
<LD>   Pale and crying, Callahan stumbled as she walked to a courtroom
holding cell after the break was called.</LD>
<LD>   Moments earlier, a defense investigator seated beside her asked
Callahan whether she was about to pass out, then alerted her lawyer,
who requested a break in the proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   The recess came amid testimony from Ventura County Sheriff's Det.
William Gentry, who recounted that Callahan, 30, a Ventura resident,
told him how skinhead gang members had viciously stabbed and beat a
teenage girl to death in a motel bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan told the detective that she sat outside the bathroom door
as the two men killed Nichole Hendrix, 17, with a pocket knife and a
flashlight.</TE>
<TE>   When they came out of the bathroom, Callahan told the detective,
she walked in and saw Hendrix slumped naked in the bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like her neck was slit," Gentry testified, recalling
Callahan's statement during a December 1999 police interview.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry interviewed Callahan before her arrest and indictment on
murder charges in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan now faces one count of first-degree murder for allegedly
helping skinheads David Ziesmer, 29, and Michael Bridgeford, 25, kill
Hendrix.</TE>
<TE>   The two men--who are also charged with murder and are awaiting
trial--suspected Hendrix of reporting them to police for selling
stolen property and decided to kill her, according to court
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry testified that investigators had few leads in the case
until Callahan came forward.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities knew that Hendrix, a Ventura continuation school
student, had disappeared Oct. 15, 1998, and that her skeletal remains
were found six months later in the mountains above Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   They knew Callahan had rented a room at the City Center Motel near
downtown Ventura. And they knew Hendrix had made a phone call from
there that night.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1999, Callahan threaded the evidence together by
telling authorities what happened in Room 10, Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan agreed to identify the alleged killers and wear a
recording device to obtain statements to corroborate her story. In
exchange, authorities agreed to move her out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said that in a subsequent interview Callahan recounted the
following:</TE>
<TE>   Hendrix called Callahan on Oct. 15, asking for help in selling
some property. Callahan had previously talked to Ziesmer and
Bridgeford about needing to raise bail money for a mutual friend, and
they all went to the motel to sell the goods.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrix passed out after she took some prescription pills. When
she awoke, she telephoned her mother. However, Ziesmer, a recent
parolee, became suspicious that Hendrix was actually talking to
police.</TE>
<TE>   "Ziesmer said they would have to kill her," Gentry testified.</TE>
<TE>   The detective said Callahan told him that Ziesmer ordered Hendrix
into the bathroom and instructed Callahan to guard her. The detective
said Hendrix asked Callahan, "Why is this happening?"</TE>
<TE>   "[Callahan] said that she kissed her on the forehead and [said]
that she couldn't help her, she couldn't stop what was going to
happen," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities later decided that Callahan was a participant--not a
witness--and prosecutors charged her with murder.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today before Ventura County
Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr.</TE>

<HD>Freeway Atop Rail Line Offered as Way to Relieve 91
Congestion</HD>
<DH>Transit: Ten-mile route linking Orange and Riverside
counties is just one idea for shortening commutes. Another is a
tunnel in Cleveland National Forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Irvine Co. has proposed stacking a freeway on top of railroad
tracks through Santa Ana Canyon to relieve traffic on the Riverside
Freeway, an idea that illustrates how desperate planners are to ease
the daily crush on one of Southern California's most congested
highways.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-mile freeway would be built above a heavily traveled rail
line from Interstate 15 in Riverside County to the Foothill tollway
in northeast Orange County, running parallel to the Riverside
Freeway. The result would be side-by-side freeways passing through
the canyon that links Orange and Riverside counties.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is one of several ambitious proposals to handle commuters
from Riverside and San Bernardino counties traveling to jobs in
Orange and Los Angeles counties. Others include drilling a tunnel or
carving a highway through the Cleveland National Forest, and
double-decking sections of the Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   The rail-line freeway idea was unveiled by Irvine Co.
representatives during a meeting last month with Riverside County
officials, who have been overhauling their transportation plans. The
company provided no cost estimates or drawings.</TE>
<TE>   Though it has received no official endorsement, the Irvine Co.
proposal is significant because transportation planners and elected
officials are eager to agree on a way to relieve pressure on the
Riverside Freeway, the only major link between the fast-growing
Inland Empire and Orange County's ample job market.</TE>
<TE>   Building a second freeway through Santa Ana Canyon could satisfy
both counties by providing a new transportation link without
intruding into the rugged forest, company officials said. It also
would help meet future demands created by as many as 71,000 homes
planned on old dairy farms in Chino and Ontario off Highway 71, which
intersects the 91 Freeway west of Corona.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be a good idea that is in the ballpark," said Eric
Haley, executive director of the Riverside County Transportation
Commission. A major player in transportation projects for 20 years,
the Irvine Co. has been openly skeptical of other possible routes,
especially a proposed 11-mile tunnel that would run from Highway 133
in Irvine to Cajalco Road at Interstate 15. Company officials fear
they would have to pay for road improvements caused by workers using
the tunnel to head to jobs in north Irvine. The company is planning
17 million square feet of office space there.</TE>
<TE>   "We were invited to the table and we wanted to involve ourselves,"
said Dan Miller, a government liaison for the developer. "We were not
there just to say 'no' to the tunnel. This was another idea. Frankly,
it's taken on a life of its own."</TE>
<TE>   Motorists make about 250,000 trips a day on the Riverside Freeway.
By 2025, commuters are expected to make more than 400,000 daily
trips. Dealing with such dramatic growth has been a source of
political tension between Riverside and Orange counties. Elected
officials are wary of public reaction, the cost, how projects would
be financed and potential damage to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the proposals are novel. Neither an elevated freeway
nor a tunnel has been built in Southern California, though the
necessary technology exists. Taisei Construction Corp. of Japan has a
tunnel-boring machine that could easily handle the job, said Thomas
Tschudin, a vice president for the company's American subsidiary
based in Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing things that were in the science fiction books 30
years ago," he said. So far, Riverside County has examined four
surface routes to bring traffic through Cleveland National Forest,
options that are politically opposed in Orange County. One of the
routes would involve rebuilding the winding Ortega Highway between
Lake Elsinore and San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   The underground proposals include the Cajalco tunnel, designed by
former Irvine Mayor Bill Vardoulis, which would bring cars, trucks
and utility lines through the mountains. A tunnel proposed by the
Riverside County Building Industry Assn. would cut through the
mountains from Interstate 15 and loop back to the Riverside Freeway,
where it would connect to the Foothill tollway along four miles of
double-decked lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Both tunnels would link to Cajalco Road, which turns into the
Ramona Expressway and runs past the former March Air Reserve Base,
one of the region's newest cargo airports.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning
agency, endorsed an alignment between the city of Irvine and Cajalco
Road in 1998. Executive director Mark Pisano said the planning effort
was dropped in the face of opposition from the Orange County
Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County officials have insisted that short-term improvements
to the Riverside Freeway be made first. They point to OCTA polls
showing the public opposes any route through the forest. They also
insist that more inland commuters are driving toward jobs in north
Orange County and Los Angeles County than in Irvine, indicating a
more northerly alternative is needed. The idea of building an
elevated highway above the railroad tracks has its skeptics. Among
the concerns are increasing pollution in the canyon, and the high
cost and feasibility of using railroad right-of-way.</TE>
<TE>   Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which owns the tracks, was unaware
of the Irvine Co. proposal, spokeswoman Lena Kent said. She said it
is too early to comment, except to say that the railroad would not
want its service impaired or its plans for growth hampered.</TE>
<TE>   The route is one of the region's main rail links to the bustling
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and serves Metrolink commuters.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an expensive route," Riverside County's Haley said. "There
are lots of challenges--environmental, engineering, and the railroads
are tough negotiators."</TE>
<TE>   Reliance on the rail line will probably grow in coming years, an
argument against using the right-of-way, said Bruce Nestande, a
former member of the California Transportation Commission. "If there
were ever a place they need mass transit, it is in this corridor. You
just can't build your way out with highways."</TE>
<TE>   Vardoulis, a former OCTA board member who owns BV Engineering in
Irvine, has lobbied for the Cajalco tunnel for almost three years. He
said the Irvine Co. and OCTA have fought him every step of the way.</TE>
<TE>   His plan calls for boring three side-by-side tunnels through the
Santa Ana Mountains. They would carry cars in each direction with a
central tunnel ferrying trucks on a rail line. The tunnels also would
carry water from Lake Mathews, as well as electricity, natural gas
and phone lines.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities, plus car and truck tolls, would pay for the
$3-billion construction cost, he said. "You are going to have to have
another corridor or Orange County's economy is going to suffer."</TE>

<HD>Freeway Atop Rail Line Offered as 91 Relief</HD>
<DH>Transit: The 10-mile route linking Orange and Riverside
counties is just one idea. Another is a tunnel through Cleveland
National Forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Irvine Co. has proposed stacking a freeway on top of railroad
tracks through Santa Ana Canyon to relieve traffic on the Riverside
Freeway, an idea that illustrates how desperate planners are to ease
the daily crush on one of Southern California's most congested
highways.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-mile freeway would be built above a heavily traveled rail
line from Interstate 15 in Riverside County to the Foothill tollway
in northeast Orange County, running parallel to the Riverside
Freeway. The result would be side-by-side freeways passing through
the canyon that links Orange and Riverside counties.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is one of several ambitious proposals to handle commuters
from Riverside and San Bernardino counties traveling to jobs in
Orange and Los Angeles counties. Others include drilling a tunnel or
carving a highway through Cleveland National Forest, and
double-decking sections of the Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   The rail-line freeway idea was unveiled by Irvine Co.
representatives in a meeting last month with Riverside County
officials, who have been overhauling transportation plans. The
company provided no cost estimates or drawings.</TE>
<TE>   Though it has received no official endorsement, the proposal is
significant because planners and elected officials are eager to find
a way to relieve pressure on the Riverside Freeway, the only major
link between the fast-growing Inland Empire and Orange County's job
market.</TE>
<TE>   Building a second freeway through Santa Ana Canyon could satisfy
both counties by providing a new transportation link without
intruding into the rugged forest, company officials said. It also
would help meet future demands created by as many as 71,000 homes
planned on old dairy farms in Chino and Ontario off Highway 71, which
intersects the Riverside Freeway west of Corona.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be a good idea that is in the ballpark," said Eric
Haley, executive director of the Riverside County Transportation
Commission.A major player in transportation projects for 20 years,
the Irvine Co. has been openly skeptical of other possible routes,
especially a proposed 11-mile tunnel that would run from Highway 133
in Irvine to Cajalco Road at Interstate 15. Company officials fear
they would have to pay for road improvements caused by workers using
the tunnel to head to jobs in north Irvine. The company is planning
17 million square feet of office space there.</TE>
<TE>   "We were invited to the table and we wanted to involve ourselves,"
said Dan Miller, a government liaison for the developer. "We were not
there just to say no to the tunnel. This was another idea. Frankly,
it's taken on a life of its own."</TE>
<TE>   Motorists make about 250,000 trips a day on the Riverside Freeway.
By 2025, more than 400,000 daily trips are expected. Dealing with
such dramatic growth has been a source of political tension between
Riverside and Orange counties. Elected officials are wary of public
reaction, the cost, how projects would be financed and potential
damage to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Neither an elevated freeway nor such a tunnel has been built in
Southern California, though the necessary technology exists.</TE>
<TE>   Taisei Construction Corp. of Japan has a tunnel-boring machine
that could easily handle the job, said Thomas Tschudin, a vice
president for the company's American subsidiary based in Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing things that were in the science-fiction books 30
years ago," he said. So far, Riverside County has examined four
surface routes to bring traffic through Cleveland National Forest,
options that are politically opposed in Orange County. One of the
routes would involve rebuilding the winding Ortega Highway between
Lake Elsinore and San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   The tunnel proposals include the Cajalco tunnel, designed by
former Irvine Mayor Bill Vardoulis, which would bring cars, trucks
and utility lines through the mountains. A tunnel proposed by the
Riverside County Building Industry Assn. would cut through the
mountains from Interstate 15 and loop back to the Riverside Freeway,
where it would connect to the Foothill tollway along four miles of
double-decked lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Both tunnels would link to Cajalco Road, which turns into the
Ramona Expressway and runs past the March Air Reserve Base, one of
the region's newest cargo airports.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning
agency, endorsed an alignment between the city of Irvine and Cajalco
Road in 1998. Executive director Mark Pisano said the planning effort
was dropped in the face of opposition from the Orange County
Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County officials have insisted that short-term improvements
to the Riverside Freeway be made first. They point to OCTA polls
indicating the public is opposed to any route through the forest.
They also insist that more inland commuters are driving toward jobs
in north Orange County and Los Angeles County than in Irvine,
indicating a more northerly alternative is needed.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of building an elevated highway above the railroad tracks
has its skeptics. Among the concerns are increasing pollution in the
canyon, and the high cost and feasibility of using railroad
right-of-way.</TE>
<TE>   Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which owns the tracks, was unaware
of the Irvine Co. proposal, spokeswoman Lena Kent said. She said it
is too early to comment, except to say that the railroad would not
want its service impaired or its plans for growth hampered.</TE>
<TE>   The route is one of the region's main rail links to the bustling
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and serves Metrolink commuters.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an expensive route," Riverside County's Haley said. "There
are lots of challenges--environmental, engineering, and the railroads
are tough negotiators."</TE>
<TE>   Reliance on the rail line will probably grow in coming years, an
argument against using the right-of-way, said Bruce Nestande, a
former member of the California Transportation Commission. "If there
were ever a place they need mass transit, it is in this corridor. You
just can't build your way out with highways."</TE>
<TE>   Vardoulis, a former OCTA board member who owns BV Engineering in
Irvine, has lobbied for the Cajalco tunnel for almost three years. He
said the Irvine Co. and OCTA have fought him every step of the way.</TE>
<TE>   His plan calls for three side-by-side tunnels through the Santa
Ana Mountains. They would carry cars in each direction with a central
tunnel ferrying trucks on a rail line.</TE>
<TE>   The tunnels also would carry water from Lake Mathews, as well as
electricity, natural gas and phone lines.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities, plus car and truck tolls, would pay for the
$3-billion construction cost, he said. "You are going to have to have
another corridor or Orange County's economy is going to suffer."</TE>

Deadline Pressure</HD>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   What if the Lakers' Robert Horry had taken his sweet time setting
up that three-pointer against the Sacramento Kings, instead of
swishing it with six-tenths of a second left on the clock? The Lakers
would not have won Game 4 of the Western Conference finals and
probably not gone on to three-peat as NBA champs.</LD>
<LD>   What if The Times' editor had decided to blow off the deadline
last night and wait for more interesting news? You wouldn't have a
newspaper this morning.</LD>
<TE>   The world--the successful world--runs on deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature, pathetically, does not when it comes to the most
important thing the lawmakers do each year: pass a state budget.</TE>
<TE>   For 13 of the last 16 years, a budget has not been enacted until
after--usually long after--the start of the new fiscal year, July 1.
Actually, the California Constitution requires the Legislature to
pass a budget by June 15. But legislators are totally, arrogantly
disrespectful of that constitutional deadline. There is no penalty or
shame.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if they were stirred by a gentle alarm clock in mid-June
and realized they'd better get up, shower and go to work.</TE>
<TE>   "Why doesn't this process start earlier?" asks rookie Assemblyman
John Campbell of Irvine, Republican vice chairman of the Budget
Committee. "Negotiations take time because people need to think,
positions need to change."</TE>
<TE>   Budget subcommittees begin deliberating early in the year, shortly
after the governor submits his proposed spending plan. But
legislative leaders rationalize they can't seriously negotiate until
after the governor presents his "May revise," based on April income
tax filings. Nonsense. It's just procrastination.</TE>
<TE>   This week, there's an eerie quiet in the Capitol. Livin' is easy.
Air conditioning protects the pols from the Central Valley's furnace;
it was 112 degrees Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   One of the gravest errors ever committed in the Capitol, of
course, was the installation of central air. Before that--back in the
sweaty era of ceiling and desk fans--lawmakers routinely passed the
budget in time to escape Sacramento's oven. These summers, the
Capitol is much too comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians ritualistically perform their "Dance of Death," once
explained to me this way by a legislative strategist: "Everybody
dances around the fire. They throw stuff at us. We throw stuff at
them. Everybody falls over dead and we start all over."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is shut down, having passed a $99-billion budget June
29. But Assembly leaders are dancing, out of sight behind closed
doors and apparently in small steps.</TE>
<TE>   "These meetings have all the excitement and adrenaline of a Pat
Boone concert," reports one insider.</TE>
<TE>   If history is a clue, things won't get intense until Californians
start squawking--like the private vendors who service prisons,
veterans homes and firefighters but can't get paid without a budget.
Lawmakers will start hearing from them in a week or two.</TE>
<TE>   Who's to blame this year? Point your finger in any direction.</TE>
<TE>   At the core, there's no trust, no long-established relationships.
In the Assembly, there's also little experience in closing a big
deal. Blame term limits.</TE>
<TE>   And blame Gov. Gray Davis. He needs at least four Republican votes
in the Assembly, but refuses to negotiate with GOP leaders. Instead,
he's going around them, trying to buy off four Republicans
individually, as he did last year. The leaders feel disrespected and
shunned.</TE>
<TE>   The governor believes-- understandably--that the GOP only wants to
stall the budget and gridlock the Capitol. Gridlock will provide
Republican Bill Simon with more ammunition to shoot at Davis' "failed
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Simon camp Wednesday unveiled a new TV ad denouncing
the "budget crisis" and Davis' proposed tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Blame the Republicans. Not just for constantly cheap-shotting
Davis, but for being so hidebound anti-tax that they're virtually
impossible to bargain with on the $23.6-billion budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) finally did begin
trying to negotiate seriously with GOP leaders Monday. Blame him for
not doing that sooner, for showing little sense of urgency.</TE>
<TE>   A budget ultimately will pass. GOP leaders need to ask themselves
whether they'd like to celebrate a victory--maybe after negotiating
some deal for conservatives--or whine about a few renegades jumping
ship to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Davis needs to realize that every day the standoff continues, he
looks worse.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, the biggest problem here is not higher taxes,
deeper cuts or excessive borrowing--not insults and inexperience, or
Davis vs. Simon.</TE>
<TE>   This is about a Capitol full of politicians who can't do their
work on time.</TE>

<HD>Religious Club Wins Ruling on School Fee</HD>
<DH>Courts: A judge says the L.A. district, for now, cannot
charge group for after-school meetings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal court has ordered the Los Angeles Unified School District
to at least temporarily allow a Christian group for elementary
students to use campus facilities for after-school meetings free of
charge.</LD>
<LD>   The school district had prohibited the Good News Club from
regularly meeting at Chase Street Elementary School in Panorama City
without paying the fees required of many other organizations.</LD>
<LD>   But in issuing a preliminary injunction against the school
district earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow in
Los Angeles said it appears that such fees discriminate against a
religious organization and violate the 1st Amendment.</LD>
<TE>   Morrow will schedule a hearing to discuss whether the injunction
should be made permanent.</TE>
<TE>   The district allows student-run clubs and organizations and the
Boy and Girl Scouts to meet on campus after school without paying
fees. It requires other groups, such as churches and community or
corporate organizations, to pay fees to cover the costs of school
maintenance during the meetings, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Good News Club said it is unfair to exempt just
some organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Thomason, director of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the
Child Evangelism Fellowship, which sponsors the Good News Club, said
she paid an initial fee of $60 but still did not receive approval
from the district to conduct the meetings at Chase Elementary.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was prejudicial. I knew it was discrimination," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The group's national organization won a major victory last year
when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that schools may not bar the Good
News Club and other religious groups from meeting on public school
campuses. The decision, which stressed the right of free speech, came
in response to a prohibition by Milford Central School District in
Milford, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   With that precedent, the Child Evangelism Fellowship decided to
challenge the Los Angeles rental fees, and filed suit in February.</TE>
<TE>   Adrianne Konigar, a school district attorney who is handling the
case, said the district has no problem allowing the Good News Club to
meet on campus if it pays.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue here is not whether they can form that club," she said.
"It is over the fee."</TE>
<TE>   She said the district may appeal if the injunction is made
permanent.</TE>
<TE>   If one religious group is not required to pay but others are, it
may imply that the district unconstitutionally supports one religion
over another, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Good News Club, which operates thousands of chapters across
the country, encourages youngsters to study the Bible, learn
religious values and sing Christian songs.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Cite Democracy in Appeal</HD>
<DH>Courts: Stephen Yagman and Erwin Chemerinsky argue that by
denying legal representation to terror suspects, we become like them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accusing the federal government of subverting democratic values, Los
Angeles lawyers asked an appellate court Wednesday to allow them to
represent more than 500 foreign prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay
naval base in Cuba in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Who are we?" asked civil rights attorney Stephen Yagman, speaking
before a three-member panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. "The
answer is we're Americans. We're not them."</LD>
<LD>   He asserted that if the U.S. continued to indefinitely hold the
detainees captured in Afghanistan without making their names public
or stating why each is being held, "We shall become them"--an
undemocratic society like that of our enemies.</LD>
<TE>   "These are people purported to be held by our government, perhaps
in perpetuity, who don't have access to lawyers," Yagman said. "There
has to be someone in our system of liberties who can come into court
and say something for these people."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Yagman and USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky
sued President Bush, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other
federal officials, contending that the prisoners were being
unlawfully confined and were entitled to a court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In February, U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz dismissed the
suit, saying that the attorneys had no relationship with the
prisoners and therefore no right to represent them. Moreover, Matz
said no U.S. judge has jurisdiction because the detainees are being
held on Cuban soil.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate panel--composed of Judges Marsha Berzon, John Noonan
and Kim M. Wardlaw--heard an hour of arguments and is expected to
issue a ruling later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Defending the federal government, Justice Department Deputy
Solicitor General Paul D. Clement said the situation is unique,
framed by the terror attacks that left thousands of Americans dead.</TE>
<TE>   Matz's ruling was "exactly right"' that no U.S. court had any
jurisdiction over the detainees, Clement said. And even if a U.S.
court did have jurisdiction, he said, Yagman and Chemerinsky have no
right to represent the detainees because they have no relationship to
any of those held at Guantanamo.</TE>
<TE>   He cited prior federal appellate decisions, saying that if an
attorney wants to represent a defendant in essence, as a "next
friend," the attorney has to have some relationship to the
individual.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the leading cases in which there have been clashes over
whether an attorney has the right to file an action on behalf of an
inmate with whom he does not have a relationship involve the death
penalty. In those cases, a prisoner is seeking to abandon his appeals
and an attorney is attempting to keep the case alive. The key issue
is whether the attorney really has the best interest of the client at
heart.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky said that there never had been a decision by the
Supreme Court or any federal appellate court denying "next friend"
standing to an attorney in a situation in which the prisoner had no
access to a court.</TE>
<TE>   Berzon asked whether the Guantanamo detainees really had no access
to U.S. courts because two lawsuits have been filed in Washington on
behalf of 14 detainees from Australia, England and Kuwait. The cases
were consolidated and a ruling is pending on the government's motion
to dismiss the case.</TE>
<TE>   Wardlaw asked, "What is the rationale for allowing someone in your
position, with no relationship to the detainees, to pursue litigation
on their behalf when the other people capable of doing so?"</TE>
<TE>   Yagman said that he and Chemerinsky did not claim to represent the
individuals in the Washington cases, whose families had managed to
obtain the attorneys for them.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Chemerinsky said it was a "logical fallacy to infer that
the rest of detainees have access to U.S. courts. Nothing on the
record indicates these people have any access to courts other than
through this case," Chemerinsky said. He suggested to the judges that
if they had any doubts, they should send the case back to Matz with
orders that he hold an evidentiary hearing on whether these detainees
had any access to lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "This case requires you to face a question no other court has yet
faced," Chemerinsky said. "If there are individuals with no other
access to a court, can a suit be brought for them by someone with
relationship to them? Our position is international law and [rulings
of] the Supreme Court require access to the courts."</TE>

<LD>For years, Christie Lee Fleming's death remained one of many unsolved
homicides in Los Angeles County. But 13 years later, a former
boyfriend was charged Wednesday with her murder after new DNA
technology linked him to cigarette butts found at the crime scene.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives arrested Arturo Johannas Gutierrez, 41, at his Perris
home after a crime-lab analysis connected him to the evidence. He had
been a suspect in the May 13, 1989, killing, but there hadn't been
enough evidence to prosecute, Sheriff's Lt. Ray Peavy said.</LD>
<LD>   An autopsy revealed that the 25-year-old secretary was beaten and
died of suffocation. Authorities said repeated DNA tests had failed
to yield useful results--until March.</LD>
<TE>   The test performed this time, called Short Tandem Repeats,
represents state-of-the-art DNA technology. The Sheriff's Department
has been using it since 1999, but Fleming's slaying is among the
first old unsolved--or cold--cases in which it has been employed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the first where we've met with success early on,"
said Dean Gialamas, assistant director of the sheriff's crime lab.</TE>
<TE>   Just five years ago, DNA tests wouldn't have solved the crime, he
said. Back then, a sample needed to be at least the size of a dime to
be effective. "Today we can use something as small as a period at the
end of a sentence and get full results," Gialamas said. The Short
Tandem Repeats test is so conclusive that the "chances of finding
someone with the same genetic profile usually exceed the population
on Earth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's sister, Rhonda Fleming, said she never doubted
Gutierrez's culpability. The couple had dated since high school and
broke up when he joined the military. He began seeing Christie again
even though he had married someone else, Rhonda said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been really hard to just sit back and wait, but I prayed
every night this would happen," she said. "My prayers have been
answered."</TE>

<DH>Safety: Small fires are mostly contained by evening. About
200 structures in Lockwood Valley are threatened early in the day.</DH>

<LD>Brush fires ranging from less than an acre to 50 acres plagued
Ventura County on Wednesday but caused no injuries or structural
damage and were mostly contained by evening, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Forest Service firefighters were battling a 50-acre brush
fire Wednesday near Lockwood Valley Road and California 33, but the
fire was no longer spreading, said Joe Pasinato, a forest service
spokesman. The cause of the fire was unknown.</LD>
<LD>   Working on dry and sometimes steep terrain, 150 forest service and
county firefighters attacked with engines and hand crews on the
ground, while tankers and helicopters doused the fire from the air,
Pasinato said.</LD>
<TE>   Moderate vegetation and muggy weather were helping firefighting
efforts, Pasinato said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's looking good for us," Pasinato said late in the day.</TE>
<TE>   While some firefighters were working to keep the fire from moving
northeast on Lockwood Valley Road toward denser terrain, other crews
already were being sent home as the fire appeared to be nearing
containment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, the fire threatened about 200 ranch structures
scattered throughout the Ozena area of the valley before the Ventura
County Fire Department sent in a strike team to remove brush around
the buildings, county fire spokeswoman Sandi Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ozena area also contains a fire station and campgrounds, but
no evacuations were necessary and all structures appeared to be safe,
Pasinato said.</TE>
<TE>   A brush fire of less than an acre at the Rocketdyne Santa Susana
Field Laboratory near Simi Valley was quickly contained early
Wednesday afternoon by the company's fire crew, Boeing spokesman Dan
Beck said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire at the field lab, which is regularly used
for rocket engine testing, was unknown, Beck said.</TE>
<TE>   There were no injuries or structural damage, Beck said, and the
company's 12-member fire crew contained the fire in less than half an
hour with ground engines.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Clarita, a brush fire sparked by a burning car was fully
contained Wednesday morning after charring more than 60 acres and
threatening homes, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   And on the third consecutive day of brush fires in northern Los
Angeles County, two new fires burned 12 acres near the Golden State
Freeway and Smokey Bear Road, north of Pyramid Lake, a Los Angeles
County Fire Department spokesman said. Two lanes of the freeway were
closed for a short time.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clarita blaze began Tuesday when three men driving north
on the Golden State Freeway stopped on the shoulder because of car
trouble, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Andrew Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   "The vehicle caught fire and the winds carried the fire to the
nearby shrubbery and right through the canyon," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Freeway traffic was backed up for hours, and firefighters advised
dozens of residents to voluntarily evacuate the area, though no homes
were damaged.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The illegal use of a Northridge house by a college fraternity, which
resulted in numerous complaints from neighbors, has ended, city
officials announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under a June court settlement with the homeowner over a number of
infractions, no more than four members of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity
can live in the one-story ranch house in the 17000 block of Parthenia
Street near Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the residents cannot host parties in the rented house until
2004.</LD>
<TE>   Pi Kappa Phi's members must attend monthly meetings of a local
homeowner's association and spend at least eight hours each month
cleaning up the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "The party's over," City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said Wednesday,
applauding the fraternity's neighbors and his staff for pushing for
sanctions for fraternity members' "detestable behavior."</TE>
<TE>   A party at Pi Kappa Phi in February attracted more than 1,000
people, causing police to show up in riot gear.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo's office is also investigating neighbors' complaints
about two other fraternities that have members living in homes near
the campus.</TE>

<HD>Westerfield Team Calls Witnesses</HD>
<DH>Trial: His ex-girlfriend supports some of his defense in
Danielle van Dam's death, but says he became physically 'forceful'
after drinking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A woman who once lived with David Westerfield testified Wednesday
that his drinking and subsequent dark moods broke up their
relationship late last year and that he followed her and made her
feel uncomfortable just weeks before the disappearance of 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield is accused of kidnapping and killing the girl from the
Sabre Springs neighborhood after a night of drinking with her mother
and others at a local bar.</LD>
<LD>   The witness, Susan L.--her last name was withheld to protect her
children--had been summoned by Westerfield's attorneys as a defense
witness.</LD>
<TE>   "I still care for him," she said as she buried her face in her
hands and wept. On several occasions, she looked at Westerfield with
a sad expression.</TE>
<TE>   But during cross-examination she testified that during their
four-year relationship Westerfield often became sullen and withdrawn
when he was drinking and that he also became physically "forceful."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek presented a transcript of an
interview between Susan L. and a police officer in which she said she
came home after a night out with a male friend in mid-January and was
startled to see Westerfield sitting in his car outside her home.</TE>
<TE>   She told Dusek that the day after the incident she told
Westerfield to leave her alone because she felt uncomfortable with
his drinking and behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, she learned on television that he was a suspect
in the Feb. 2 disappearance of Danielle, whose family lived two doors
away from Westerfield in the upscale San Diego suburb.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by Dusek about Westerfield's mood when drinking, she said:
"He would become very quiet. Sometimes he would become a little
upset." Asked why they ended their relationship, she said, "Because
of the drinking."</TE>
<TE>   In a interview taped before Westerfield's arrest, the 50-year-old
engineer told police that he was "pretty drunk" the night before
Danielle's disappearance and did not remember what happened after he
left the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by defense attorney Robert Boyce, Susan L. also
provided testimony that supported Westerfield on several points.</TE>
<TE>   For example, she said that he "sweated a lot." Police officers
have testified that one thing that made them suspicious of
Westerfield was that he was perspiring heavily when they first talked
to him.</TE>
<TE>   She also testified that it was not unusual for Westerfield to go
the desert in his 34-foot recreational vehicle on the spur of the
moment. "He's an outdoor person," she said. "He likes the sun."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have suggested that Westerfield's trip to the Silver
Strand on Coronado and then to Glamis in the Imperial Valley on the
day Danielle was discovered missing is suspicious and may have
provided an opportunity for him to dump the girl's body in the rural
area where volunteer searchers found it Feb. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, an insect expert called by defense attorneys
testified that the number and developmental stage of insects found on
Danielle's body suggest that her body was left there at a time when
Westerfield was being watched by police 24 hours a day. Entomologist
David Faulkner, who has testified in dozens of murder cases, said the
insect evidence suggests that the body was discarded between Feb. 16
and 18. Westerfield was under round-the-clock surveillance beginning
Feb. 5; police followed him, tapped his phone and secretly put an
electronic device in his car.</TE>
<TE>   Lead defense attorney Steven Feldman had said that scientific
evidence would prove that his client could not have been the killer.</TE>
<TE>   But under cross-examination by Dusek, Faulkner said weather and
other factors can influence insect lifecycles and thus pinpointing
exactly when the body was dumped is not possible.</TE>
<TE>   Faulkner said that the amount and development of the insects could
have been affected by the unseasonably warm, dry weather in San Diego
County. Also, he conceded that the flies may not have descended on
the body until after animals attacked it.</TE>
<TE>   Criminologists have testified that Danielle's blood, hair and
fingerprints were found in Westerfield's home and recreational
vehicle. One said on Tuesday that fibers found in Westerfield's home
were identical to those from a sheet found near the child's body.</TE>

<HD>DNA Clears Yoga Guru in Seven-Year Paternity Dispute</HD>
<DH>Results: Separate tests show the yogi didn't father a
disciple's son, but the man bringing the charges sticks to his claim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A renowned guru has been cleared by DNA testing of charges that he
broke his celibate vows and fathered a child, his Los Angeles
headquarters announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement marked the latest development in a seven-year
paternity dispute involving Paramahansa Yogananda, who was one of the
first Indian masters to introduce yoga philosophy to the West 80
years ago. The guru, who died at age 59 in 1952, was accused of
having an illicit affair with a married disciple and fathering Ben
Erskine, now a 69-year-old Oregon gold miner.</LD>
<LD>   To conclusively settle the claims, Yogananda's worldwide
organization, the Self-Realization Fellowship, hired a former San
Diego criminal prosecutor to establish an independent testing process
to compare Erskine's DNA to samples taken from Yogananda's three male
relatives in India. The results from two separate labs both showed no
relationship between Erskine and Yogananda.</LD>
<TE>   "For members who revere Paramahansa Yogananda as their profound
spiritual guide and guru, the claims were very hurtful and very sad,"
fellowship spokeswoman Lauren Landress said. "But these results
conclusively show there is no truth to them."</TE>
<TE>   Erskine, informed of the results Wednesday, said he still believed
that "Yogananda is my father." His attorney, Shane Reed, said they
would review the DNA results to decide whether to proceed with a
court request to disinter Yogananda's corpse, buried in Glendale, for
further testing.</TE>
<TE>   At stake was more than the guru's integrity: Any successful
paternity action could have led to claims on the assets of
Yogananda's spiritual organization, which owns several pieces of
prime property, including the flagship Lake Shrine in Pacific
Palisades and a hermitage in Encinitas.</TE>
<TE>   The organization operates more than 500 temples and meditation
centers in 178 countries; its members have ranged from the late
George Harrison to the famous botanist Luther Burbank. Yogananda
initiated such figures as Mahatma Gandhi into kriya yoga and authored
such spiritual classics as "Autobiography of a Yogi," which has been
translated into 18 languages.</TE>
<TE>   G. Michael Still, the former San Diego prosecutor who relied
extensively on DNA testing in his rape and homicide cases, said the
results would prevent Erskine from claiming standing in court to seek
any inheritance, copyright assets or the disinterment of the guru's
body.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, this is airtight," said Still, who added that he
was not a fellowship member and knew "little to nothing" about the
organization before being hired last year to oversee the testing
process.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute first surfaced in 1995 when Erskine's daughter, Peggy,
approached the fellowship with the paternity claims and financial
demands. Erskine said his mother, Adelaide, had been a disciple and
photographer of Yogananda in the late 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   The miner acknowledged that his mother never told him he was
Yogananda's son or that she had been physically intimate with the
famed guru. But he said his mother hinted at the "wonderful blood" in
his veins and fought constantly with her husband--Erskine's
stepfather--over her son's paternity. His stepfather berated her with
accusations of an affair with the guru, Erskine said, and called him
"the little black bastard" because his complexion was darker than
that of his four siblings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was talked about constantly," Erskine said. "I would have been
an imbecile not to know" of the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The visit by Erskine's daughter prompted a fellowship attorney,
Michael Flynn, to initiate the first round of DNA testing on hair
samples, which was found inconclusive. A second round of testing on
blood samples last July showed no relationship. But Reed and Erskine
rejected the results as biased because the blood specimens were
collected and sent to the labs by a fellowship monk they claimed
could have doctored the samples.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, the dispute went public with a splashy cover story
in a Los Angeles alternative newspaper, fueling efforts by the
organization to try to settle the matter once and for all by hiring
Still.</TE>
<TE>   Still said he hired a forensic nurse to collect blood samples from
Yogananda's three male relatives living in Calcutta, India. One of
them, Biswanath Ghosh, traveled to Los Angeles last year and declared
himself "embarrassed and insulted" by the charges. He accused Erskine
of fabricating charges in order to cash in on his uncle's assets and
fame. "How is this possible?" Ghosh said of the charges. "My uncle
was a famous holy man."</TE>
<TE>   The forensic nurse videotaped and photographed the entire
collection process, confirmed the identity of each of the relatives
and oversaw the shipment of samples to two laboratories that worked
blindly from each other. The two labs compared six Y chromosome
markers, which Still said pass unchanged from one male generation to
the next. Both concluded that the three Yogananda relatives were
related genetically, but that Erskine was not.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the organization quietly released the results to its
members, beginning with morning meetings for about 60 nuns and 40
monks. Notices were scheduled to be posted at the organization's
eight California temples in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Members expressed satisfaction that the DNA results appear to have
put the matter to rest--but were not surprised that their beloved
guru's name would be cleared.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, this whole thing was kind of a
non-event," said Mike Baake, marketing manager for the group's
publication center. "Anyone with any awareness of who Paramahansa
Yogananda was knew that story wasn't true. When someone in the world
tries to do something good, someone else always wants to pull them
down."</TE>

<LD>The family of an Arleta man who was fatally shot at a gas station
three months ago joined Los Angeles police detectives Wednesday in
asking for the public's help in finding his killers.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Alejandro Padilla, 18, was shot once in the head April 25 as
he rode as a passenger in a Chevy Suburban that was riddled with
bullets on Roscoe Boulevard near Webb Avenue in Sun Valley, said Det.
Vince Bancroft of the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood
Division.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla died two days later at Providence Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills.</LD>
<TE>   "My son did not deserve to die like he did," said Padilla's
62-year-old father, also named Jose. "He did not deserve that violent
death."</TE>
<TE>   Police released video captured by surveillance cameras at the gas
station on the night of the shooting, hoping someone might identify a
late model turquoise sedan, possibly a BMW or a Mercedes-Benz,
thought to be driven by the killers. The car had shiny rims and very
thin "low-profile" tires, Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   The assailants pulled in front of the Suburban about 10:15 p.m.,
blocking it from leaving the station. Without warning, three or four
occupants of the sedan fired at least 25 shots at the Suburban,
Homicide Det. Mike Coffey said. Two other men in the Suburban were
injured and were treated and released from a local hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police that the sedan fled east on Roscoe
Boulevard, Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla would have received his high school equivalency diploma in
June at the North Valley Occupational Center in Mission Hills and was
scheduled to begin a warehouse job the day after he was shot, his
girlfriend, Jenny Molina, said. He was working to support his
16-month-old daughter, Desyrae, Molina said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they hope the release of the surveillance tape brings
some tips.</TE>
<TE>   "We are basically stalled" with the investigation, Bancroft said.
"We found numerous people who heard gunshots, but no one who saw
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call homicide detectives at
(818) 623-4075.</TE>

<HD>Teen Gets 79 to Life in Slaying</HD>
<DH>Courts: Isaac Lara of Oxnard was convicted of fatally
shooting a woman after a party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 19-year-old Oxnard man was sentenced to 79 years to life Wednesday
for fatally shooting a woman after a party in Santa Paula two years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Isaac Lara scowled as Ventura County Superior Court Judge Herbert
Curtis III read his sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Lara was convicted May 22 of fatally shooting Joanna Orozco, 21,
in the back after a party in Santa Paula on Nov. 7, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   He was also found guilty of attempted murder in the shooting of
Orozco's friend, Shane Longoria, 22. The shootings occurred after
Orozco and Longoria argued with Lara at the party.</TE>
<TE>   Orozco's mother, Ruth Garcia, addressed Lara during the
sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   "This has destroyed our family," she said. "I know I'll never be
the same again. I want him to realize how much his daughter means to
him, because my daughter meant that much to me."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. John West said the vicious nature of the crime
merited the maximum sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Public Defender William Markov argued that Lara did not
warrant such a harsh penalty because of his age and lack of serious
criminal history.</TE>
<TE>   In sentencing Lara, Curtis called the shootings "one of the most
vicious, cold, cruel and callous" crimes he has seen during his time
on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis ordered Lara to complete a drug counseling or treatment
program or pay a $10,000 fine to the state. Lara was also ordered to
pay $11,056.80 in restitution to Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Lara will receive credit for the nearly two years he has already
served in jail.</TE>
<TE>   West said later that he was satisfied with the verdict and the
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge pretty much wrapped up my feelings about it," he said.
"This was a particularly vicious crime."</TE>
<TE>   Lara, who admitted he was under the influence of drugs when the
shootings occurred, maintained throughout his trial that two
unidentified men were responsible for the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "He's remorseful for the family's loss, and let everyone know
that," Markov said after the trial. "But he can't apologize for
something he didn't do."</TE>
<TE>   Lara plans to appeal, Markov said.</TE>

<HD>Response to Attack at LAX Praised</HD>
<DH>Police: Reaction is called swift and effective.
Nevertheless, Hahn says patrols will be increased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Airport police and LAPD officers arrived on the scene seconds after
the Fourth of July shooting at Los Angeles International Airport and
quickly secured the crime scene, officials said Wednesday. But it
remained unclear whether an elaborate camera system caught the event
on tape, and some experts said the city should review its airport
evacuation plans and approach to security.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn said, meanwhile, that he would increase police
patrols at LAX.</LD>
<LD>   As details continued to emerge about how various law enforcement
agencies responded to the shooting in the Tom Bradley International
Terminal, the consensus was that action was speedy and effective.</LD>
<TE>   Airport police said they relied on a widely used training document
that directs officers to immediately go to a shooting scene.</TE>
<TE>   "We had people on the scene before the echo of gunshots died
away," said Bernard J. Wilson, chief of airport police, at an airport
news conference Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The morning of the shooting, one sergeant and seven airport police
officers were in the Bradley terminal, according to a timeline
compiled by airport police. Within 35 to 40 seconds--just as El Al
airline security guards subdued and killed the Egyptian gunman--all
eight officers arrived at the shooting scene, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes later, almost two dozen airport police officers and
commanders had arrived at the Israeli state airline's upper-level
ticket counter, according to the timeline.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department officers also were nearby and joined
airport police within moments, said LAPD Deputy Chief David Kalish.</TE>
<TE>   "Officers arrived on the scene almost simultaneously [with airport
police]," he said. "Together, we were able to stabilize the
situation, secure the crime scene and facilitate the Fire
Department's response for medical needs."</TE>
<TE>   After El Al security guards stopped the shooter, airport police
and the LAPD worked to secure the area, sequester witnesses for
interviews, shut down airport roads so emergency vehicles could get
through, and evacuate passengers, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as they praised each other for the coordinated response, the
agencies recounted some initial disagreement about which agency
should lead the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD typically takes charge of murder investigations at the
airport, but in this case the FBI took over because of the
possibility that the shooting was a terrorist act.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they have no indication that the incident, which
left three dead--including assailant Hesham Mohamed Hadayet--and two
wounded was motivated by terrorism, although they haven't ruled it
out. They say they are also investigating whether the incident was a
hate crime or random violence.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn commended airport police, the LAPD and the FBI on Wednesday
for their response to the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he would ask the city agency that operates the
airport to keep a beefed-up LAPD presence there until at least
January.</TE>
<TE>   To do so, the airport agency will pay overtime to about 60
off-duty officers, who will relieve airport police at security
checkpoints so they can patrol the terminals.</TE>
<TE>   Airport police officers hired after the Sept. 11 attacks will
replace LAPD personnel early next year after they undergo security
training.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to prevent criminal acts from occurring," said Hahn,
who was flanked by a retinue of city and airport officials at a dais
near the United Airlines ticket counter. "We also have to be there to
respond if they do."</TE>
<TE>   Several security issues emerged at LAX after the shooting,
including the placement of security cameras and whether evacuation
procedures make passengers vulnerable to an attack outside the
terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the shooting, the FBI asked passengers who shot
still pictures or video footage of the incident to provide the
material to the agency, prompting speculation that the slayings were
not videotaped by the airport's extensive camera system.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI does have videotape of Hadayet getting out of his car in
parking structure No. 4 and walking into the Bradley terminal, a law
enforcement source said.</TE>
<TE>   But it's unclear whether video exists of the gunman at the ticket
counter, or of the shooting itself, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of cameras are installed throughout the 3,500-acre
facility to watch the airfield, traffic operations, airline gate
areas, baggage claim and security checkpoints. Cameras are not widely
used in LAX ticket lobbies because they have not been considered
high-risk areas, an airport source said.</TE>
<TE>   Security cameras won't stop all crime, but they may provide a
deterrent or help officials analyze an event, said Brian Jenkins, a
senior advisor to the president of the Rand Corp. and a former member
of the White House Commission on Aviation and Security.</TE>
<TE>   Besides surveillance, there's also the issue of how to protect
thousands of passengers when a crime occurs at the airport. In last
Thursday's incident, airport officials said they didn't need to order
an evacuation of the facility's international terminal because most
travelers left the building themselves after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   But security experts said that immediately after the shooting,
passengers who milled around on sidewalks outside the terminal could
have been vulnerable to attack if Hadayet had had accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   "Passengers evacuated from the sterile area are absolutely sitting
ducks, unless a react team simultaneously responds to observe and
protect them against perimeter threats," said Brian Sullivan, a
retired Federal Aviation Administration security agent.</TE>
<TE>   He added that a decision by airport police to shut down the
airport's U-shaped roadway on both the upper and lower levels in
front of the terminal went a long way toward protecting passengers
waiting outside for news of their flights.</TE>
<TE>   But the incident, Sullivan said, like so many evacuations that
have occurred since the Sept. 11 attacks, provides officials with an
opportunity to craft evacuation plans that will keep terrorists off
balance.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, officials should vary where they take
passengers to wait out an evacuation. Protection also must be
provided for the crowds, including from sharpshooters on nearby
buildings, he added.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, city officials will need to decide how far they want
to go to protect passengers in public areas of the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have a drive-by shooting in South-Central Los Angeles, we
don't talk about a breach of security on Crenshaw Boulevard because
it's a public place," Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "What we are doing right now is protecting airplanes,
not airports, and therefore security is designed to keep explosives
and weapons off airplanes--but not keeping villains out of airports."</TE>

<HD>Inmate Accused of Molesting Girl on Her Prison Visits</HD>
<DH>Courts: He is being prosecuted for allegedly continuing to
abuse his stepdaughter after his release. State official defends
agency policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted felon repeatedly molested his 8-year-old stepdaughter
during family overnight visits at Corcoran State Prison, the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office has alleged.</LD>
<LD>   Eugene Leonard Lee spent five weekends with his wife and
stepdaughter at the prison south of Fresno while serving an 18-month
sentence for driving drunk with a prior manslaughter conviction,
according to records.</LD>
<LD>   California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Margot Bach
defended the prison visiting policy, saying there was no way the
alleged abuse could have been predicted. She said the department did
not learn of the allegations until after Lee's release.</LD>
<TE>   "There was no reason for us to suspect that any molestation was
going on," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The case raises troubling questions about how to safeguard
children, said Kristin Hall, who works at the Sexual Assault Crisis
Agency in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disturbing that a child is going to be sexually abused at
all, especially if it's in that setting," said Hall, director of
community education and outreach for the agency. "You would expect
that children would be safe there."</TE>
<TE>   Family visits take place on prison grounds in small, furnished
apartments. The visitors bring food and can spend one or two nights
at the apartment. During the visit, correctional officers check on
the inmates at least four times a day, Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   The department does not plan to independently investigate Lee's
actions while he was in prison, Bach said, but will cooperate in the
Los Angeles case, in which Lee is charged with abusing his
stepdaughter after his release. Lee was housed at a substance abuse
treatment facility at the prison from Aug. 23, 2000, to March 18,
2002. He had previously served time for vehicular manslaughter and
had been convicted in the latest instance of drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles prosecutors said Lee fondled his stepdaughter and
forced her to touch him while at Corcoran. Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard
Goul said the inmate should never have been allowed overnight visits.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a sense of moral outrage at the irresponsibility of the
state prison system to allow any convicted felon to be alone with a
child, especially a felon who was convicted of killing someone," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee allegedly continued the assaults after his release from
Corcoran until the abuse escalated into a "horrifying three-day
period" between April 21 and 23, Goul said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee faces three counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child,
two counts of forcible rape and one count of a forcible lewd act with
a child. He is scheduled to appear July 25 in Superior Court and, if
convicted, faces 69 years to life in prison. His wife, who reported
the alleged abuse to authorities in April, does not face any criminal
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Goul said he plans to present evidence of the alleged Corcoran
crimes at trial. That evidence will probably include testimony from
the stepdaughter and what the prosecution says is a taped admission
from Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors did not file charges on the alleged molestation at
Corcoran because Lee is already facing a possible life sentence from
the other charges and because there were potential "jurisdictional
hurdles" with the prison case, Goul said.</TE>
<TE>   Bach said the Corrections Department is very careful how it
reviews requests for overnight family visits. Inmates convicted of
sex crimes or violent acts against family members are not eligible.</TE>
<TE>   Staff at Legal Services for Prisoners With Children agrees that
the abuse, if it did occur, was horrible.</TE>
<TE>   But Donna Willmott, the family advocacy coordinator, said this is
the first time she has heard of such a case. She said she hopes it
doesn't lead to more restrictions on family visits in prisons.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see the possibility for this going in a direction that
would make even more draconian measures that would have very negative
impacts on children," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Willmott said the overnight visits are crucial in helping inmates
preserve relationships with their families so they are able to
reintegrate into the community upon release.</TE>

<LD>So the kid might have grabbed the cop's testicles.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes, in defending their use of force, cops say a suspect
reached for a weapon. In this case, 16-year-old Donovan Jackson
allegedly reached for a set of jewels, according to the cop who
punched him in the face.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, as you must know by now, was the subject of a Saturday
altercation that was caught on videotape in Inglewood. I don't know
how much is paid out each year to settle brutality lawsuits in
Southern California, but it might be cheaper to just buy every single
resident a video camera so cops stay on their best behavior.</LD>
<TE>   Even U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, never accused of being a civil
rights activist, was disturbed enough by the video to open an
investigation. Of course, that may have more to do with President
Bush learning from the mistakes of his father, whose downfall
arguably began with him ignoring the causes and results of the Rodney
King riots 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Some readers--including several cops--were ticked off by my
assessment of the Inglewood altercation in Wednesday's column. I
wrote that no matter what preceded the videotaped part of the
incident, there was no justification for Jackson, a kid with no
arrest record, being roughed up while his hands were cuffed behind
his back.</TE>
<TE>   An angry Inglewood cop e-mailed me to say I didn't know the facts
of the situation. I asked if he was referring to the jewel grab,
which had been rumored, and he responded: "When someone has a handful
of your testicles, and I speak from experience, yes it certainly does
justify the punch."</TE>
<TE>   I'll respond to that later.</TE>
<TE>   My colleague Beth Shuster reports in today's paper that Officer
Jeremy Morse claims in the incident report that Jackson had him by
the privates, and he was in "extreme pain." Morse also reported that
he then punched Jackson in the face.</TE>
<TE>   I spoke to one of the Jackson family's attorneys outside the
federal courthouse Wednesday after they filed a complaint. Portasha
Moore called the testicle claim utter nonsense and said it's disputed
by Jackson and his father.</TE>
<TE>   All right. Let's go to the video.</TE>
<TE>   To set it up, Jackson's father had pulled into a gas station, and
Jackson had gone into the mini-mart for a bag of potato chips. When
he returned, he saw police talking to his father about a lapsed
registration. Police say a scuffle broke out when the boy refused to
stand back. Jackson ends up on the ground in handcuffs, Morse has
some blood on his head, and at this point, unbeknown to anyone, a
witness begins videotaping.</TE>
<TE>   We see officers stand Jackson up, his hands cuffed behind him, and
then Morse suddenly lifts him off his feet and slams him face-first
onto the trunk of the car. It's after this, according to the sequence
as laid out in the police report, that Jackson grabbed his privates.</TE>
<TE>   I watched over and over, in slow motion, forward, reverse and
every which way, and it is not clear whether Jackson grabbed Morse's
business or not. You simply cannot tell.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's hands appear to be in a position where he could
conceivably have grabbed the officer, even though he was handcuffed
and face down on the trunk of the car. And Morse does appear to react
angrily to something specific. After the first punch, in fact, it
appears that he raises his hand to clobber Jackson again, but he's
blocked by other officers.</TE>
<TE>   So let's say, for the sake of argument, that Jackson did grab the
officer. Does it justify a punch in the mouth?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is no. If the officer feared the kid might reach for
his service weapon, it would be understandable, but that's not what
we're being told. And it's fairly pathetic that four veteran officers
couldn't restrain a handcuffed, slightly built 16-year-old without
one of them hauling off and punching him in the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Look, we're all aware that police work is nasty stuff, that cops
are underpaid, and that they're unrealistically expected to solve all
of society's problems, as well as show up 10 seconds after we call
for help. We know they put their lives on the line, and make
split-second decisions that are easy for people like me to
second-guess.</TE>
<TE>   But they choose this work, and they do so knowing that in spite of
the danger, pressure and threat of lawsuits from lottery-happy
plaintiffs and attorneys, there's a measure of pride in performing a
difficult public service with integrity and professionalism, as most
of them do.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me to my main point.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the testicle allegation for a moment. What about what
happened moments earlier? The video clearly shows a cop losing his
cool.</TE>
<TE>   Let me repeat: Morse picked a handcuffed boy up off his feet and
slammed him into the car.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Jackson did grab the cop's privates after that, it might
have been the desperate act of a terrified kid who feared he was
about to become the next Rodney King.</TE>
<TE>   Even the defensive cop who e-mailed me said of the body slam into
the trunk: "I will not try to justify the action."</TE>
<TE>   Morse's conduct was ugly, it was inexcusable, and with any
justice, there will be no chance of a repeat performance.</TE>

<HD>Kenneth MacKenzie, 90; Helped Discover Astatine, Built
UCLA's Atom Smasher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, who worked on the atomic bomb as a graduate
student, helped discover the element astatine, helped build UCLA's
cyclotron and later concentrated on studying thermonuclear fusion as
a nonpolluting energy source, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   MacKenzie, who taught physics at UCLA for more than four decades
beginning in 1947, died July 3 at his home in Los Angeles of
complications after a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   As a doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley under atomic scientist
Ernest O. Lawrence, MacKenzie was one of the men who discovered
element 85 of the periodic table: astatine.</LD>
<TE>   The radioactive substance, formed by bombarding an isotope of
bismuth with alpha particles, helped verify the accuracy of the
table.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie also helped his mentor built the first cyclotron at what
is now the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   As World War II neared, MacKenzie was assigned to help solve the
problem of large-scale separation of uranium-235 at the federal Oak
Ridge, Tenn., laboratory, a crucial step in the Manhattan Project to
create the atom bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Adapting needs to wartime shortages, MacKenzie and his colleagues
borrowed 14,700 tons of silver from the U.S. Treasury and melted it
into strands to replace copper in their magnetic coils. After the
war, the silver was melted into bullion and returned to the treasury.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie joined the UCLA faculty in 1947 and helped install
Lawrence's original cyclotron, the first atom smasher of its kind in
the world, which was shipped from Berkeley to Westwood. In 1955, he
directed construction of a 49-inch cyclotron for UCLA and formally
retired the Lawrence device.</TE>
<TE>   By 1958, MacKenzie and his colleague Byron Wright had developed
such expertise in building cyclotrons that they formed MEVA Corp. to
built cyclotrons for teaching physics. They also constructed a
seven-ton model magnet and power supply for the Naval Radiological
Defense Lab in San Francisco. Their firm was later bought by Hughes
Aircraft Co.</TE>
<TE>   When MacKenzie turned to studying plasma gases for use in fusion
energy, he founded UCLA's Plasma Physics Laboratory. He focused his
research and teaching on fusion technology and studying dark matter.
As an emeritus professor, he continued his research long after
leaving the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Portland, Ore., MacKenzie grew up in Victoria, Canada,
and earned his undergraduate degrees at the University of British
Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie is survived by his second wife, Verna; three children
from his first marriage, Robert of Redondo Beach, Wallace of
Riverside and Maryann M. Johnson of Blue, Ariz.; three stepsons,
Mark, Thomas and Bryce Augustine; a sister, Betty Nickull; two
brothers, Robert and Ronald; and one half-brother, Rod MacKenzie.</TE>
<TE>   A public memorial service will be scheduled at UCLA.</TE>

<DH>Investigation: Documents are seized at San Diego-based
Metabolife as part of a tax evasion probe.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internal Revenue Service agents on Wednesday seized documents at a
major San Diego marketer of herbal weight-loss products as part of an
income tax evasion investigation, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   About 40 IRS criminal investigators spent most of the day at the
San Diego headquarters of Metabolife International Inc. and at its
warehouse and shipping center, IRS Special Agent Mark Lessler said.</LD>
<LD>   Documents seized remained under seal and the investigation is
continuing.</LD>
<TE>   Company workers were sent home as they arrived at work in the
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Metabolife acknowledged in a statement that the IRS was conducting
a tax investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The company has said it expects to be "fully exonerated."</TE>
<TE>   The statement said the investigation apparently has nothing to do
with the company's products, the most prominent of which is
Metabolife 356, sold at many retail outlets.</TE>
<TE>   The product contains herbal ephedrine, a stimulant used by
consumers hoping to lose weight or boost athletic performance.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have linked such products to heart attacks, seizures
and strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson recently
announced that he had commissioned a study of the largely unregulated
product.</TE>

<HD>MTA Will No Longer Hire Felons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spurred by the case of a burly driver who molested a teenage boy on
an empty bus, MTA officials on Wednesday announced that they will no
longer hire people with felony and certain misdemeanor convictions.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority would
consider people with felony convictions for employment if some years
had passed since the crime, and as long as they qualified for the
job, said Marc Littman, a spokesman for the agency.</LD>
<LD>   But the conviction of Anthony Zaragoza--a 325-pound father of
three--for molesting a 140-pound, 15-year-old boy from North Carolina
in June 2001 prompted the MTA to change its hiring policy. People who
have plea-bargained felony charges down to misdemeanor convictions
also will be barred from being hired, Littman said.</LD>
<TE>   He called what Zaragoza did inexcusable and tragic, but he said
the incident should not be used to portray all MTA buses as
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not making any excuses, but there are 5,000 bus and rail
operators and the vast, vast majority are law abiding and hard
working," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Littman said that within 18 months, all MTA buses will have
surveillance cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza was sentenced in March to 30 years in prison. He worked
for the transit agency despite having been convicted in 1980 of armed
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   On June 20, 2001, Zaragoza made sexual advances to the young
tourist as the bus idled on a Hollywood side street. The boy secretly
turned on a video camera he had. A menacing Zaragoza is heard saying,
"I could pin you to the floor and take your pants off without you
stopping me."</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza then fondled the boy before letting him leave.</TE>

<HD>'Our Favorite Fair' Gets Ready</HD>
<DH>Event: The summer staple emerges from this week's
controlled chaos to open Friday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karen Worley drove across the country this week with a 2,850-pound
horse and a 3,450-pound steer. Brandi Glenn came from San Luis Obispo
to help sculpt 500 tons of sand. And Bill Russell hustled in from Las
Vegas with his giant handwriting-analysis machine that, for $1.50 a
pop, will tell you who you are.</LD>
<LD>   Their destination: the Orange County Fair in Costa Mesa, which
opens Friday for a 17-day run.</LD>
<LD>   "This is our favorite fair," said Worley, who lives in Bradenton,
Fla., with her horse named Hercules and her steer named White
Mountain. "It's well organized, clean and busy--and that's what we
come for."</LD>
<TE>   About 1,000 people a day have been laboring all week to make sure
that tradition continues, said fair Chief Executive Becky
Bailey-Findley, who began preparations last August. This year's theme
is "Leap Into the Fair--We're Making a Big Splash."</TE>
<TE>   "Each year we try to pick a theme that's agricultural,"
Bailey-Findley said. "Last year it was sun, and this year it's water.
Maybe next year it will be dirt."</TE>
<TE>   Attractions in keeping with the theme--represented by a frog
motif--include an area called Beachfront that features exhibits on
the history of swimwear and surfing, as well as the three giant sand
sculptures Glenn is working on; two new ponds; a "ribbet exhibit"
about frogs and reptiles; and a water-drop ride offering fairgoers a
75-foot "unattached controlled" freefall into a safety net.</TE>
<TE>   "You're taken to the top of a tower and then dropped like a drop
of water into a net," Bailey-Findley said.</TE>
<TE>   The fair has also added some top-line entertainment, including
Huey Lewis &amp; the News, Linda Ronstadt, the Indigo Girls, the B-52s,
the Guess Who, Styx, Boz Scaggs, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Carrot Top and
"Weird Al" Yankovic.</TE>
<TE>   And, in keeping with the post-9/11 mood, opening day is being
touted as a "Salute to Heroes," with the $7 admission fee waived for
active military, law enforcement and fire personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey-Findley said that advance ticket sales are already 30%
above what they were for last year's fair, which attracted about
845,000 people. "For the most part, we are a community event," she
said, "so the drop in travel may actually help us--people are looking
for something close to home."</TE>
<TE>   Security has been beefed up, with 10% more security personnel
added to the fair's 1,200 employees as well as an increased Orange
County sheriff's presence. "We're trying to be very aware and keep
direct lines of communication open," Bailey-Findley said.</TE>
<TE>   The grounds have been busy this week with last-minute
preparations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of my favorite fairs," said Glenn, 33, hosing down a
huge pile of sand for a company called Sandscapes, whose founders met
18 years ago in Seal Beach before moving to Northern California.
"It's very classy, and they like to change the mix while keeping old
favorites."</TE>
<TE>   Russell, 52, who spends the summer months carting his handwriting
analysis machine to fairs and festivals nationwide, described the
Orange County crowd as "a little bit more educated and affluent" than
those at many other county fairs and thus more interested in his
machine. "They have more inquiring minds," he said, "so are more
interested in esoteric things."</TE>
<TE>   Jaye Hellmich, 13, of Costa Mesa said she had come a few days
early with other members of the Goathill Go-Getters, a local 4H Club,
to prepare Lilly Pad, a pig she had raised, to be shown at the fair.
"We walk them every day, feed them and play with them," she said.
"They're just like big puppies."</TE>
<TE>   Will it all come together in time for Friday's opening? "It's
organized chaos," Bailey-Findley admitted, "kind of like that
controlled freefall."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, she said, "it's magical. I walk around Thursday night
saying, 'Oh, we won't be ready.' But it's like fairies come in the
middle of the night and we are always ready."</TE>

<LD>All we can say about the dismantled Kosher Burrito stand is RIP (rest
in pastrami). Luckily, there is melting pot fare elsewhere, notably
the Japanese Jewish Pizza at HamaSaku restaurant in West L.A. It's a
combo of salmon, tuna, yellowtail and vegetables over tofu cheese
with a light miso sauce on a thin platter of dough.</LD>
<LD>   What? No pastrami?</LD>
<LD>   Just the thing to get the pulse racing: Juanice Charmaine of La
Verne visited a nearby hospital for a blood test and couldn't help
but notice a macabre juxtaposition of signs (see photo). What was
that lyric in the "Rocky Horror Show"? Oh, yeah: "Come on up to the
lab/ And see what's on the slab?"</LD>
<TE>   Unwanted attention? You may have read how Steven Spielberg rang
the cash register to the tune of $25 million in fees from companies
that had their products showcased in his new movie, "Minority
Report."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of fund-raising has been accelerated by studios seeking
insurance against low box-office returns. Anyway, it got me to
thinking about some of the more off-beat cases of product placement
on the screen. I hope the companies didn't pay for these references:</TE>
<TE>   In "E.T.," the hungry little extraterrestrial invades the
refrigerator of his earthling hosts and tastes the contents of a jar
labeled Boys Market Potato Salad. He then screams and throws the
container against the wall. Boys discontinued that label before the
chain was bought out.</TE>
<TE>   In the satirical "Demolition Man," set in 2032, the police state
of Southern California offers only one type of restaurant: Taco Bell.</TE>
<TE>   In "The African Queen," Katharine Hepburn dumps Gordons Dry Gin
overboard to keep it out of the hands of alcoholic river pilot
Humphrey Bogart.</TE>
<TE>   In "Christine," based upon a Stephen King novel, a homicidally
jealous 1958 Plymouth hunts down the girlfriends of its owner.</TE>
<TE>   In "Escape from L.A.," Universal Studios' Black Tower office
building and studio tour are shown buried on the bottom of the newly
formed San Fernando Sea after a monstrous earthquake. (Interestingly
enough, the studio's parent, Vivendi Universal, is now flooded with
debt.)</TE>
<TE>   Did Fritz Coleman know about this? When the 2001-02 meteorological
year ended June 30, rainfall in L.A., 4.42 inches, was the lowest
ever recorded by the National Weather Service here. A Laundromat
sign, snapped by Kenneth Kopec of Yucaipa awhile back, summarizes it
neatly, if accidentally (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   And while we're in the past tense: Rob Lee, an English teacher at
Pasadena City College, was dismayed to see botched punctuation at a
concession stand in Orange County. The stand was open, contrary to
what the sign indicated. I don't want to reveal which amusement park
Lee was visiting, but suffice it to say, the mistake was berry bad.</TE>

<HD>Heat Wave, Power Plant Crash Sap State's Electricity
Supplies</HD>
<DH>Energy: A Stage 2 emergency is declared as reserves hit
lowest level in a year. Public is urged to conserve.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With the West gripped on Wednesday by a second day of record high
temperatures, the sudden loss of a key Southern California power
plant pushed the state's electricity reserves to their lowest level
in a year and forced a Stage 2 emergency.</LD>
<LD>   Power supplies slipped dangerously low, state officials said, and
they urged residents to conserve. The emergency ended at 6 p.m. and
did not apply to Los Angeles, which is served by a city-owned utility
with abundant reserves.</LD>
<LD>   "If we had had this kind of weather last summer, the lights would
be off from Eureka to El Centro," said Gov. Gray Davis, whose
administration has worked to stabilize California's electrical system
after a disastrous brush with deregulation. "Last year, the heavens
smiled and we had a mild summer. This year, we may have a hot summer,
but we're far better prepared ... than we were last summer."</LD>
<TE>   State grid operators declared the emergency at 3 p.m., after
Reliant Energy's power plant near Oxnard unexpectedly shut down with
mechanical problems. The plant had been producing enough power to
supply half a million homes.</TE>
<TE>   When the plant went offline, reserves in the state slipped below
5%, forcing utilities to disrupt power to businesses that had
volunteered for such emergency cutbacks. That 1,000-megawatt
curtailment helped the state get through the afternoon without
blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for electricity in the three-quarters of the state served
by the California Independent System Operator rocketed to 42,441
megawatts, the highest of the year. Consumption peaked 603 megawatts
higher than Monday, when a Stage 1 emergency was triggered, according
to Cal-ISO.</TE>
<TE>   The supply squeeze is not expected to disrupt service by the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power, which is independent of
Cal-ISO. The DWP has enough power to serve its customers for the rest
of the summer, General Manager David Wiggs told reporters Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Barring a catastrophe, we should be in very good shape to assure
we have no shortage of power for our customers," Wiggs said. "But we
need to encourage all Angelenos to use that power wisely."</TE>
<TE>   Broiling temperatures across the West drove air-conditioning use
to 145% of normal, devouring electricity that otherwise could have
been imported to California from other states. Seattle hit 88
degrees, Portland 98, and Phoenix and Las Vegas both sweltered at
108.</TE>
<TE>   With California largely dependent on its own energy resources,
state and utility officials beseeched residents to embrace
conservation as enthusiastically as they did during the electricity
crisis of 2000 and 2001, when wholesale prices soared and blackouts
threatened even in low-consumption winter months.</TE>
<TE>   Go easy on the air conditioning, turn off lights and avoid doing
laundry until after 7 p.m., they urged.</TE>
<TE>   "You can try to control every contingency, but the one you can't
control is how often Mother Nature wants to hit 110 or 115 and how
widespread that is," said Richard Katz, an advisor to Gov. Davis.
"We're asking people throughout the state to help us, as they did
last year, meet our conservation goals."</TE>
<TE>   Conservation has slacked off in recent months. Californians
conserved 3% less electricity last month than they did in June 2001,
for example.</TE>
<TE>   Davis blamed the power emergencies on weather, not on a lack of
preparation.</TE>
<TE>   Power plants capable of producing 3,000 megawatts, enough to
supply more than 2 million homes, have been built in California since
the last blackout in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Water Resources also signed tens of
billions of dollars worth of long-term power contracts a year ago to
serve the customers of three private utilities that were financially
crippled by the power crisis. Several major contracts were
renegotiated this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "The contracts were restructured to give us cheaper power and
power when we needed it," said Davis, "plus I told DWR to err on the
side of buying power because meteorologists have been wrong before."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the contracts, the state had purchased 88% of the
power it needed Tuesday in advance, Katz said. The rest of the
electricity was purchased on the spot market.</TE>
<TE>   Prices in that market were capped by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission in June 2001 and recalculated after Monday's power
emergency, as dictated by the FERC order.</TE>
<TE>   The price cap, which applies across the West, dropped from $92 per
megawatt-hour to $57.14 on Tuesday, then was lowered in the evening
to $55.26 per megawatt-hour.</TE>
<TE>   Some generators warned that the lower allowable price for their
electricity would discourage power production.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Wheatley, spokesman for Reliant Energy, said Wednesday
morning that the state should expect a spate of mechanical breakdowns
as plants run harder.</TE>
<TE>   Power plant owners within California are obligated to supply
Cal-ISO if the electricity is available and needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's going to take their plants down deliberately," Wheatley
said. But he predicted that "you're going to see things that you've
seen in the past--you'll see numerous plant breakdowns; we've seen
some of that ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing any of us wants to see is a repeat of the
California energy crisis," he said, "but we have to have enough
incentives to provide the power and to make a reasonable profit."</TE>
<TE>   The plant near Oxnard was tripped off after one of two large fans
broke, causing a safety hazard, Wheatley said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be working all night," he said Wednesday afternoon, "but I
don't know when it will be back in service."</TE>

<TE>   Handling the Heat</TE>
<TE>   Keep thermostats at 78 degrees rather than fiddling with the
temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Don't try to cool a place quickly by setting the temperature very
low.</TE>
<TE>   Vacuum air conditioners weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Install temporary window reflectors, such as aluminum-covered
cardboard, to reflect heat back outside.</TE>
<TE>   Stay indoors, on the lowest floor and out of the sun, as much as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Avoid taking cool showers after coming indoors, since the extreme
temperature change could cause hypothermia.</TE>
<TE>   Learn how to give first aid in case of heatstroke, heat exhaustion
or cramps.</TE>

<HD>William Ruger, 86; Built No. 1 Gun Maker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William B. Ruger, a flinty entrepreneur who turned a childhood
fascination with guns into the nation's largest firearms
manufacturing company, died Saturday at his home in Prescott, Ariz.
His death at 86 came after a period of declining health.</LD>
<LD>   Ruger was co-founder and chairman emeritus of Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co.
of Connecticut, a manufacturer admired by sportsmen and collectors
since it began selling pistols in 1949.</LD>
<LD>   Considered one of America's greatest gun designers along with
Samuel Colt and John Browning, Ruger was involved in the development
of every pistol, revolver, shotgun and rifle his company produced
over the last half-century. It sells more than 260 models of guns.</LD>
<TE>   Ruger also was known for his outspoken defense of the gun
industry, targeted in recent years by municipalities and other
plaintiffs seeking to make manufacturers including Sturm, Ruger
liable for gun-related crime.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sound crass or oversimplify things when so many
people are dying out there on the streets," he told the New York
Times in 1994. "But the firearms business is not the place to put the
blame. Gun making has been an honorable and important business in
this country for a long, long time. It's a cliche, but it's still
true: People kill people, not guns."</TE>
<TE>   Colt, Winchester, Smith &amp; Wesson and Remington were the four
titans of the gun industry when Ruger and his partner, artist
Alexander McCormick Sturm, launched their small company 53 years ago.
Ruger took over after Sturm's death in 1951 and eventually outpaced
all of his competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Ruger was a true firearms genius who mastered the disciplines of
inventing, designing, engineering, manufacturing and marketing better
than anyone since Samuel Colt," said R.L. Wilson, a firearms
historian who wrote a 1996 biography of Ruger. "He was the only one
in the history of firearms ... who mastered it all."</TE>
<TE>   The gun-control movement was Ruger's greatest frustration, Wilson
noted, because he felt it unfairly blamed "good, honest citizens who
like guns."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on June 21, 1916, Ruger was 12 and
recovering from scarlet fever when his grandfather gave him his first
gun, a Remington .22 pump-action rifle. It captivated the schoolboy
with a mechanical turn of mind. "It was the mechanism that intrigued
me," he told an interviewer several years ago. "A beautiful,
coordinated piece of machinery."</TE>
<TE>   He was still in high school when he designed and built a gun in a
neighborhood machine shop. Later, at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill, he began designing a light machine gun that elicited
enthusiasm from Army ordnance officials. After dropping out of
college, he was hired at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts,
where many of the guns used in World War II would be developed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1940 he went to work at Auto Ordnance Corp. at its Bridgeport,
Conn., factory. Auto Ordnance made the legendary Thompson submachine
gun favored by gangsters. He spent a few years there perfecting his
machine gun designs before the need to earn more money to support his
family spurred him to try other ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Auto Ordnance had gone into the record player business by the
mid-1940s, so Ruger launched a small firm to supply it with component
parts. After two years he switched to making a deluxe line of
carpentry tools, but he had to shut down because of unwieldy
production costs.</TE>
<TE>   Strapped for cash, he dug up one of his old blueprints for a
.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. Sturm, a social acquaintance,
provided $50,000 in start-up capital and Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. was born.</TE>
<TE>   Sturm, a Yale-educated artist, handled advertising and marketing
while Ruger designed the guns. His .22-caliber pistol, the sole
product sold by the fledgling company in 1949, became a major
success. It remains one of the world's most popular target pistols.</TE>
<TE>   While his competitors relied on machine tooling of parts and hand
assembly, Ruger in 1953 turned to casting guns out of molten steel.
Less wasteful and capable of producing more detail, the process known
as investment casting gave him an edge over industry leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he refused to rely on large government contracts,
a strategy that led to Colt's bankruptcy filing in 1988. He appealed
primarily to hunters and collectors, continually whetting their
appetite for "new stuff" with innovations such as guns made of
titanium and other exotic metals.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, he insisted that wholesalers drop Smith &amp;
Wesson from their inventory if they wanted to sell his products.
Forbes magazine reported in 1992 that about half of the nation's gun
wholesalers complied, giving Rugers more cachet.</TE>
<TE>   The company has sold more than 20 million guns, a number that
commands the attention of gun-control advocates. Rugers have been
used in a number of high-profile shootings, including a 1998
schoolyard massacre in Jonesboro, Ark., and a 1993 shooting that
killed five on a Long Island commuter train.</TE>
<TE>   While decrying such crimes, Ruger refused to accept blame for
them. He pointed out that the company's advertising always emphasized
the word responsible, as in "Ruger: Best Quality Firearms for
Responsible Citizens."</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that moral decay and family breakdown were the real
culprits behind escalating crime figures.</TE>
<TE>   With a bearish build, the rugged industrialist was often described
as a cross between Teddy Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway.</TE>
<TE>   He collected antique cars and nearly entered the auto-making
business in the 1970s when he commissioned the design and
construction of a sports tourer called the Ruger Special. He
ultimately decided against producing the car, deterred by government
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   He retired as chairman in 2000, a year after Sturm, Ruger
surpassed Smith &amp; Wesson as the country's No. 1 gun manufacturer.
Company officials said Ruger had kept the company profitable for 50
years without ever borrowing money.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his son, William Jr., who succeeded him as
chairman; daughter Carolyn R. Vogel; six grandchildren; and 10
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>The wife of Rep. Gary Condit can pursue her $10-million defamation

<LD>   U.S. District Judge Oliver Wanger rejected the tabloid's arguments

<HD>Secession Bid Dealt 2 Setbacks</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Key Valley cityhood backers might consider
alternative proposal. And prime mayoral candidate may join the other
side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley cityhood proponents are expected to lose a
high-profile aspirant for mayor of the would-be city today, at a time
when two secession leaders say they would drop the civic breakaway
attempt if a plan for a vastly revamped Los Angeles government could
replace it on the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The twin developments are a sign of the waning prospects of voters
approving a separate city in the Valley, some political analysts and
supporters of a united Los Angeles said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But backers of a Valley city said their movement remains strong.
They said they are unfazed both by the fact that some of their
leaders are actively discussing the formation of boroughs within Los
Angeles, rather than a separate city, and by the apparent loss of
state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) as a candidate for Valley
mayor.</LD>
<TE>   The Valley city supporters also claimed one clear victory
Wednesday, as a coalition of chambers of commerce endorsed the new
city, citing as potential benefits lower taxes and less bureaucratic
red tape.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon is expected to announce today that he will not run for
mayor of the prospective city of 1.3 million and to say he will
oppose the breakup of Los Angeles, according to sources.</TE>
<TE>   The legislator's long-awaited decision will deprive the movement
of one of the Valley's most prominent Democrats and Latinos. But it
is not entirely unexpected--Alarcon had never committed to a Valley
city, or to becoming its first leader.</TE>
<TE>   The former Los Angeles city councilman declined Wednesday to
confirm what he will announce today in a news conference at a Van
Nuys fire station. Alarcon said his decision is based on several
factors, including how secession would affect the Valley's poor and
working-class residents.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always said that if I determined secession was not good
for the Valley and I decided not to support it, that I would not run
for mayor," Alarcon said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a USC political scientist, said Alarcon's
decision will significantly harm the bid for a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another blow. It is not helpful to the secessionists on
several levels," Bebitch Jeffe said. "There is a dearth of strong,
well-known candidates, and he would have drawn Latino voters to the
cause."</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents, including Miguel Contreras,
secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor,
agreed that Alarcon's decision not to run "would be a big victory for
us and a real blow to the pro-secessionists."</TE>
<TE>   Bebitch Jeffe and others noted that this week's developments come
as secessionists and others continue to absorb this month's Los
Angeles Times Poll, which showed a Valley city would be rejected by
voters. A majority of Valley residents support the new city, but not
those in the rest of Los Angeles, as required to complete the
breakaway.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain acknowledged that Alarcon's
candidacy would have brought leadership and "diversity" to the
cityhood campaign. But Brain said there are several Latinos who plan
to run for the new City Council and that the loss of Alarcon would
not be a setback.</TE>
<TE>   "Alarcon chose to align himself with the unions and turn his back
on the people of the Valley," Brain said. "I'm extremely disappointed
in him."</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon's withdrawal would leave Assemblyman Keith Richman
(R-Northridge) as the only announced candidate for mayor. Although he
is a moderate, Richman is running in a Valley where 51.4% of the
registered voters are Democrats and 28.7% are Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   In another development Wednesday, the chairman of the secession
effort and a key financial backer said they have considered a
proposal by state Assemblyman Robert Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) to
back division of the city of Los Angeles into boroughs, as an
alternative to creating a new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   The duo--Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close and secession backer
David Fleming-- said they would only agree to back off of secession
efforts if Los Angeles leaders supported the creation of highly
autonomous boroughs that would give the Valley the local control it
adamantly desires.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept of the Valley city was local control, and the concept
of a borough system is local control," Close said. A borough system
would "accomplish the goals of Valley cityhood without the risk and
the carnage of the Nov. 5 election."</TE>
<TE>   Delaying the Vote</TE>
<TE>   Close said that he would recommend that several Valley VOTE
members who signed the cityhood application ask that the plan be kept
off the ballot for two years, but only if city officials made a
serious commitment to creating boroughs. Only at that time--after the
city showed it could create a system giving real power to the
Valley--would secession leaders formally drop their plans for an
independent city, Close said.</TE>
<TE>   But swapping a Valley city proposal for a borough plan on the
November ballot seems highly problematic.</TE>
<TE>   The secession leaders cannot legally withdraw the cityhood issue
from the ballot, because a state commission has already determined
the plan is feasible and asked that it be put before voters, said
John Krattli, the assistant county counsel who advises the Local
Agency Formation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Krattli said cityhood is destined for the November ballot in
response to petitions signed by 202,000 Valley voters, not just the
secession leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not up to the chief petitioners," to take secession off the
ballot, he said. "This was an expression of the will of the people to
have this looked at."</TE>
<TE>   Only the county Board of Supervisors could prevent a vote this
November, by simply neglecting to put the measure on the ballot,
Krattli said. But he said that the supervisors could only avoid
moving the question to the ballot, an action they are expected to
take July 25, with "valid, legitimate reasons to cause a delay."</TE>
<TE>   The legal niceties may be moot, however, because Mayor James K.
Hahn and other supporters of a unified city appear to be in no mood
to compromise. Invigorated by polling showing secession in trouble,
Los Angeles leaders believe they can defeat secession without
chopping the city into boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   When approached with such a plan, "the mayor refused it out of
hand," Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said.</TE>
<TE>   The shift by Close and Fleming grew out of several days of
negotiations orchestrated by Hertzberg and involving some of the
region's most powerful leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the discussions aimed at reaching a compromise on
secession were billionaire Eli Broad, businessman Ed Roski, former
Mayor Richard Riordan and union leader Julie Butcher, along with
Hertzberg, Fleming and Close, participants said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to bring them together and avoid the horrible
difficulties that will occur no matter what the outcome (of the
November election) is," said Hertzberg, who has developed a detailed
borough proposal of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly damaging politically, Hertzberg said, would be a
scenario in which the Valley votes to secede, but the rest of the
city, required by law to approve of such a move, does not agree.</TE>
<TE>   The talks fell flat, however, when Hahn rejected the compromise
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Bebitch Jeffe, the political scientist, said the talks show a
waning confidence by Valley cityhood leaders. "I think it says that
they too think the momentum has slowed and that it is quite possible
secession will fail," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley cityhood leaders denied any lack of confidence, saying they
have always been looking for the best form of governance for the vast
suburban region.</TE>
<TE>   One irony became obvious in the flurry of discussions about the
fate of the November vote: Secession opponents like Hahn and Los
Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla suddenly were adopting
the language of the secessionists, insisting the Valley cityhood vote
must go forward.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what you believe about secession, the voters should
have the right to vote on this," Padilla said. "To put something on
the ballot and pull it off again sounds like deal-making to me."</TE>
<TE>   With the cityhood vote apparently still headed for the November
ballot, secessionists touted a new endorsement Wednesday--from the
United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley. The coalition
of chambers voted 31 to 13 to support Valley cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   The organization represents 25 chambers of commerce and business
associations in the Valley, which in turn have more than 8,000
business members.</TE>
<TE>   Endorsement Boost</TE>
<TE>   Bill Powers, chairman of the United Chambers and a board member
with the secession group Valley VOTE, said the endorsement will be a
big boost to secession.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very significant to the cityhood movement because it
reflects that business leaders in the Valley have had enough of being
treated as second-rate citizens by downtown," Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted a Valley city would likely abolish or cut the gross
receipts tax that is charged in Los Angeles but not in Glendale or
Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   The Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and the Central City
Assn., a downtown business alliance, previously decided to oppose
secession. Another potent business alliance, the Valley Industry and
Commerce Assn. has decided to postpone taking a position until late
September.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to give our members more time to study the issue," said
Scott Schmidt, VICA's government liaison director.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, VICA members want to wait to see who decides to run
for mayor and city council in the new city, which will not be known
until August.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are going to buy stock in a company, you want to know who
is going to be running it," Schmidt said.</TE>

<HD>The End of the Trails</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a year since the Trails served its last rib-eye steak, but
some people still can't let it go. Others can't wait until the
bulldozers arrive and the new neighbors move in.</LD>
<LD>   The popular restaurant, once a stop for Route 66 travelers that
became a local watering hole, sits on 2 1/2 acres that is caught
between parallel drives by conservationists and developers.</LD>
<LD>   A public forum Tuesday night shifted among the interests of the
project's Monrovia developer, a Los Angeles conservancy group and
dozens of local residents who have backyard views of the Trails'
empty parking lot.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, the Duarte City Council voted unanimously to rezone the
property from commercial to residential, allowing Bowden Development
Inc. to replace the eatery with a 29-home subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   Residents living in the vicinity attended the meeting en masse to
tell the council they wanted the Trails--frequently described by them
as an "eyesore"--demolished and new homes built in its place.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists and a handful of Duarte residents contended that
the site is the last remnant of Route 66 culture left in Duarte,
which hosts an annual Route 66 parade.</TE>
<TE>   Those advocates wanted the council to vote for an environmental
impact review of the property where the 55-year-old building stands.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Leib, chairman of the Los Angeles Conservancy's Modern
Committee, said after the meeting that preservationists are prepared
to sue Duarte to make sure the study is done.</TE>
<TE>   Leib and others said the city's staff reports misrepresented the
site, classifying it as a roadside diner instead of as an example of
a "ranch house" restaurant. Leib said the Trails is one of the last
buildings to exhibit that style, and one of the last true remnants of
Route 66 culture in Duarte.</TE>
<TE>   The subdivision's architect, Stefanos Polyzoides, viewed it
differently: "It's a building that has no style, no author, no [hint]
of quality."</TE>
<TE>   Duarte resident Bob Vander Valk agreed. "The Trails restaurant was
the queen of Huntington Drive restaurants," he said. "But now it's an
eyesore. Now it's a dump."</TE>
<TE>   No one argued the aesthetic beauty of the Trails, which opened in
1953 on the site of an old roadside hamburger joint. Instead, they
argued that the Trails deserved to be saved because of its connection
to Route 66, the famous roadway known for linking Los Angeles and
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't many buildings left that [connote] Route 66 and
Duarte," said resident Pat Wood.</TE>
<TE>   Duarte Mayor Phillip Reyes said Tuesday's decision to redevelop
the Trails' site was made because no one stepped forward with any
alternatives other than to delay the vote and order a study. He said
he was listening for other options but didn't hear any during the
public forum.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes said the council acted on legal advice that an environmental
impact review wasn't needed. He said such a study, which could cost
from $10,000 to $25,000, would take more than six months to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Leib pointed to a letter prepared by the conservancy's lawyer that
said a "fair argument in the record supporting the view that the site
is historic" was all that is necessary to commission the review.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes said demolishing the Trails would not mean the end of
Duarte's ties to Route 66. "We've got Route 66 running right through"
town, he said.</TE>

the building could be saved as an important part of Route 66 history.</CP>

<HD>Virk Described as Psychotic</HD>
<DH>Trial: Expert says abuse changed Ventura County woman
accused of trying to drown her children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tormented life of death threats and sexual abuse by her husband had
changed Narinder Virk from a doting mother into a delusional
psychotic the night she allegedly tried to drown her two children, a
domestic violence expert testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Based on her interview with Virk after her arrest, psychologist
Nancy Kaser-Boyd testified that the India native showed the classic
symptoms of battered woman syndrome, which, she said, contributed to
a severe mental illness.</LD>
<LD>   "I think she was psychotic based on clinical depression, which was
brought on by being a battered woman," Kaser-Boyd said during
questioning by Virk's attorney, Cynthia Ellington.</LD>
<TE>   "Psychotic impulses are hard to control, and her memory of the
events that night was spotty. She didn't remember how she got to the
water."</TE>
<TE>   Kaser-Boyd's description of Virk as severely mentally disabled at
the time of the incident supported defense testimony a day earlier by
a Newport Beach psychiatrist that depicted the slight Port Hueneme
woman as severely depressed and unable to tell right from wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Kaser-Boyd said Virk described a nightmare home life that included
being pressured by her husband, Santokh, into having four abortions.</TE>
<TE>   Kaser-Boyd testified Virk had told her that two of the abortions
were preceded by severe bleeding after physical assaults by her
husband.</TE>
<TE>   The psychologist also said she was told by Virk that her religious
and cultural beliefs were violated when her husband forced her to
watch pornographic videos.</TE>
<TE>   Virk, 42, is charged with two counts of attempted murder for
allegedly trying to drown her 6-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son
in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   She has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   She remains free on $500,000 bail put up by a group of supporters.
If convicted and found sane by a jury, she faces life in prison. If
the jury convicts her but determines she was insane at the time of
the incident, she could be placed in a state hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the woman's two children testified that Virk woke them
in the middle of the night and told them to get dressed so they could
wash their faces at the edge of a boat dock at Channel Islands
Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Both children--Harpreet, now 8, and her brother, Sonny, 11--said
that when they reached the water's edge their mother shoved them into
the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Wiggins, a former lifeguard living in the marina, heard
their cries for help and pulled them from the water.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington has argued that the events leading up to that night made
Virk--who cannot read or write in her native Punjabi and speaks
little English--so distraught that she could not have formed the
intent to kill.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutor Richard Simon has said Virk had a clear idea why
she wanted to kill her children: revenge against her husband because
he walked out on the family and returned to India.</TE>
<TE>   Much like he did one day earlier during cross-examination of
psychiatrist Sarabjit Sandhu, Simon attempted to discredit
Kaser-Boyd's testimony. He said there have been no medical records
submitted to back claims of physical abuse alleged by Virk during her
interview with Kaser-Boyd.</TE>
<TE>   Simon implied that Kaser-Boyd was a witness-for-hire willing to
craft her testimony to suit the needs of her clients.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no evidence supporting the statement that she was
physically bruised and no medical reports of the beatings that led to
the abortions," Simon told Kaser-Boyd. "Common sense tells you she
tried to drown herself and her children but you were going to try and
find a way out of this."</TE>
<TE>   Kaser-Boyd said lack of physical scarring is common in domestic
violence cases, and if present, the victim will often not be truthful
about how the injuries were received.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't question whether she experienced [domestic violence],"
Kaser-Boyd said. "She was psychotic and believed she could no longer
live in this world."</TE>

<HD>City Council Narrowly OKs Living-Wage Policy</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A divided City Council, unable to agree on how to push contractors to
better compensate lower-paid employees, approved a living-wage policy
that will go into effect Oct. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of people attended the meeting Tuesday night to encourage
council members to pass an ordinance--which they consider more
binding than a policy--to raise wages to at least $9 an hour.</LD>
<LD>   But if contractors do not comply, Oxnard's city manager can
terminate their services and impose fines, officials said. The fines
would be paid to the affected employees, said City Atty. Gary Gillig.</LD>
<TE>   Some council members argued that the city already has too many
laws that are not enforced, and that the policy could be revisited to
add health-care benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In approving the living-wage policy, on a 3-2 vote, the council
also agreed to an oversight committee to monitor contractor wages.
The policy is projected to eventually cost the city as much as $1.7
million.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, some lower-paid city employees and those working for
city contractors would receive an hourly raise of 50 cents. By the
end of 2005, workers would receive at least $12.22 an hour and be
granted 96 hours of paid leave each year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have changed significantly the way the city operates, the way
it treats its workers," said Marcos Vargas, an activist with the
Ventura County Living Wage Coalition. "We did want an ordinance ...
but this is a tremendous victory."</TE>

<HD>Silva Targets Sewage Waiver</HD>
<DH>Environment: Supervisor wants the board to urge the
sanitation district to support full treatment of the waste water it
dumps off Huntington Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supervisor Jim Silva wants his colleagues next week to urge the
Orange County Sanitation District to fully treat the waste water it
dumps into the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Silva's decision comes amid mounting pressure against renewal of a
federal waiver that allows the sanitation district to dump 243
million gallons of partially treated waste into the ocean per day.</LD>
<LD>   The sanitation district's five-year waiver is up next year. A
pivotal vote by the district's 25-member board is expected Wednesday
on whether to seek another renewal or opt for full treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Full treatment of the district's outflow would cost $250 million.
That averages an extra $16 annually per household for 20 years,
sanitation district officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Silva said he placed the resolution on the agenda for Tuesday's
Board of Supervisors meeting because he believes converting to full
treatment is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lifetime resident of Orange County, and I consider the
beaches and the harbors to be our biggest assets," Silva said. "I
know that we'll probably be going to full secondary treatment in 10
to 15 years down the line. It's probably much cheaper to do it now
than in 15 years."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activists have demanded that the district fully
treat all the waste water it discharges, as do most of the nation's
other 16,000 sanitation districts.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Huntington Beach shore has been plagued with
high bacteria counts. A $5-million sanitation district study did not
find a definitive source for the bacteria but could not rule out the
blend of waste water the district pumps four miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   During the past year, activists have won resolutions against the
waiver from city councils and water agencies whose representatives
constitute the 25-member sanitation board.</TE>
<TE>   Said Doug Korthof, who with other activists has won the 11
resolutions from city councils and water agencies: "If Silva is
successful when the Board of Supervisors meets on Tuesday that will
mean 12 votes on the sanitation board. It's real close."</TE>

Laguna Woods enforce guidelines of a pair of boards. It's confusing
and costly, officials say.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the water-quality police in California work to reduce the amount
of pollution flowing into rivers and other ocean-bound tributaries,
two small south Orange County cities that straddle a pair of water
districts find themselves afloat in rules.</LD>
<LD>   In Lake Forest, residents on one side of El Toro Road can wash
cars in their driveways, but those on the other side can't.</LD>
<LD>   In nearby Laguna Woods, landscape workers keep debris out of storm
drains by vacuuming sidewalks and gutters to comply with both sets of
water-district guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nuts," Lake Forest Mayor Richard T. Dixon said. "My
code-enforcement guy's going to get pummeled with eggs trying to
enforce this."</TE>
<TE>   Because runoff from Laguna Woods and Lake Forest flows in two
directions, city officials must follow guidelines established by both
the San Diego and the Santa Ana regional water quality control
boards. Other Orange County cities fall under the jurisdiction of one
or the other.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, the guidelines for the regions were identical.
But in recent months, each has adopted new clean-water rules. Though
the rules are aimed at keeping tainted runoff from making its way to
the ocean, those guidelines adopted by the San Diego region are more
stringent than Santa Ana's, Dixon and other officials said, leaving
the cities of Laguna Woods and Lake Forest with two sets of rules to
enforce.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro Road is roughly the dividing line between the districts.
Runoff that flows into Serrano and San Diego creeks is under the
jurisdiction of the Santa Ana regional water board, while water that
makes its way to Aliso Creek is the concern of the San Diego board.</TE>
<TE>   The main difference between the two sets of guidelines is in
monitoring. The San Diego region requires its public agencies to
monitor pollution and treat it at the source--the driveway, for
instance. The rule requires more staffing and water testing than
previous clean-water programs, which focused on street sweeping and
keeping storm drains free of debris.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Santa Ana board asks agencies to examine
historical sources of pollution and develop a treatment plan.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego regional board officials said the two programs are
compatible and claim the issue has been blown out of proportion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the case has either been misunderstood or misstated by
the cities that they have to comply with two permits or two separate
programs," said David Gibson, an environmental scientist for the San
Diego region.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cities could follow the stricter rules, city
officials aren't so sure it's fair to impose such edicts across the
board, especially in Lake Forest, where only one-third of the
community is within the San Diego district.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we'd really have to become water cops and be hated by
everyone," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   In Laguna Woods, the task of figuring out an enforcement plan
falls largely in the lap of Leisure World officials, since most of
the town's 18,000 residents live within the gates of the private
retirement community. The city, however, is responsible for enforcing
the plan and monitoring water quality.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to sort it all out," said Milt Robbins,
president of the Golden Rain Foundation board of directors, which is
the governing body for Leisure World.</TE>
<TE>   Implementing the two sets of guidelines will cost about
$300,000--compared with the $20,000 Laguna Woods spent last year on
clean-water programs, City Manager Leslie A. Keane said.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said Lake Forest may spend up to $2 million to comply with
the guidelines this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to hire employees [who] will be dedicated to
nothing but making sure that our residents can swim in our storm
drains," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon would like to see more uniformity among the guidelines in
Orange County and believes federal officials must rein in the
regional boards' authority in interpreting the Clean Water Act.</TE>

<HD>Success Doesn't Mean a Big Deal</HD>
<DH>Angels: Largely satisfied with roster, general manager
Stoneman isn't expected to make a blockbuster trade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 20 shopping days left before the trading deadline, Tim Salmon's
mind drifts to 1995, the year the Angels coughed up an 11-game lead
and lost a one-game playoff for the division championship.</LD>
<LD>   The Toronto Blue Jays solicited bids that summer for David Cone,
the defending Cy Young Award winner. The Yankees got him--for three
pitching prospects, none of whom ever amounted to anything--and he
went 9-2 for New York.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, the Angels were weak in pitching prospects, reluctant
to trade minor league catcher Todd Greene and minor league third
baseman George Arias and financially handcuffed by the ownership
transition from the Autry family to Disney. The Angels did trade for
Jim Abbott, who stopped two nine-game losing streaks when Chuck
Finley and Mark Langston could not, but to this day Salmon wonders
what could have been.</LD>
<TE>   "We lost by one game, and you think, 'If we would have had Cone
during the stretch when we were scuffling, we wouldn't have lost five
games in a row,' " Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the ultimate, when you can pick up a guy like that. You
can always improve your team. The Yankees do it every year. Look what
Oakland did with [out-fielder Jermaine] Dye last year."</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels open the second half of the season tonight in Kansas
City, they have given absolutely no indication--to their players, to
the media, to scouts, or to the general managers of other teams--that
they intend to make such a trade this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The A's already have made one. Oakland General Manager Billy Beane
traded for a starting pitcher, Ted Lilly, without sacrificing anyone
from the A's major league roster. The Seattle Mariners want to trade
for a starting pitcher and/or a power hitter.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels trail the Mariners by three games in the American
League West, even though Seattle played most of the first half
without injured cleanup hitter Edgar Martinez. The Angels also trail
the Boston Red Sox by 1 1/2 games in the wild-card race. The A's,
closing fast from behind in both races, trail the Angels by two
games, the Red Sox by 3 1/2 and the Mariners by five.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels appear largely satisfied with their roster, with Shawn
Wooten expected to return from the disabled list tonight to provide
power off the bench, with rookie John Lackey boosting the starting
rotation, and with deposed starter Scott Schoeneweis providing
another left-handed arm in the bullpen. General Manager Bill Stoneman
would like to acquire a veteran reliever to reinforce the shaky
bridge between the starters and closer Troy Percival.</TE>
<TE>   No Angel has played so outrageously above his career norm that a
second-half crash appears inevitable. Some Angels, among them third
baseman Troy Glaus, catcher Bengie Molina, designated hitter Brad
Fullmer and starters Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele, could reasonably be
expected to post better numbers. And, thus far, the Angels have
dodged significant injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no particular position you could point to and say we have
a hole there," All-Star outfielder Garret Anderson said. "The way I
see it, all our holes are filled. Just pray everybody stays healthy."</TE>
<TE>   So, if and when Stoneman completes a trade, he does not figure to
welcome the likes of Jim Thome or Brian Giles to Anaheim. He appears
much more likely to announce the acquisition of someone like Kelvim
Escobar or Paul Shuey or Mark Guthrie or David Weathers or Tom Gordon
or Jeff Fassero or (insert any name of a veteran reliever on a
noncontending club here).</TE>
<TE>   And, after last winter's acquisitions of Appier, Sele and Fullmer,
the Angels appear reluctant to make a significant addition to a
club-record $60-million player payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Said outfielder Darin Erstad, "You used to hear talk around here
like, 'If we had a couple more pitchers ... ' or, 'If we had a
full-time DH ... '</TE>
<TE>   "That talk is gone. You can't worry about what other teams are
going to do or what our front office is going to do. I'd play with
these guys straight up right now."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the last time the Angels were in first place at the
All-Star break, the Texas Rangers added pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and
infielders Royce Clayton and Todd Zeile on trading-deadline day. The
Angels did nothing, then watched in horror as Stottlemyre, Clayton
and Zeile helped the Rangers sweep five games from them in September,
lifting Texas over the Angels and into the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bavasi, then the general manager of the Angels, apologized
for not making a major trade. Stoneman appears to be betting he won't
have to apologize.</TE>
<TE>   BIGGEST FIRST-HALF SURPRISE: The Angels worried that they would
struggle against left-handers, with Wooten injured and Fullmer and
second baseman Adam Kennedy left on the bench by Manager Mike
Scioscia. But, after going 22-27 against left-handed starters last
year, the Angels are 17-6 this year, with significant contributions
from infielders Benji Gil (.405), Scott Spiezio (.356) and Jose
Nieves (.354). With 13 games left against the A's, that's
particularly good news, since the Oakland rotation now includes
lefties Lilly, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito.</TE>
<TE>   BIGGEST FIRST-HALF DISAPPOINTMENT: The Angels assembled the team
upon a foundation of starting pitching, but only Jarrod Washburn and
Ramon Ortiz have met expectations, exposing a spotty bullpen in the
process. Appier has not pitched as many as seven innings since May
14, Sele has failed to win seven starts in which the Angels scored at
least five runs, and Schoeneweis has been sent to the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   DEFINING MOMENT: On April 24, with the Angels off to the worst
start in franchise history and Scioscia answering questions about job
security, he threw caution to the wind and batted reserve outfielder
Orlando Palmeiro third. If the Angels had lost, critics would have
wondered about a panic move by a panicked manager. But Palmeiro got
three hits, the Angels beat Seattle for the first time in seven tries
this season, and they started a 21-3 run that propelled them into the
pennant race.</TE>
<TE>   AT THIS PACE: Without a single player hitting 30 home runs, the
Angels will set a club record for runs scored. Anderson and Salmon
will shatter the club record for doubles. Washburn and Ortiz will
become the Angels' first 15-game winners since Finley in 1996, and
Ortiz will become the first right-hander to win 15 since Bert
Blyleven in 1989. Percival will save 30 games for the fifth
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   REASON TO BE EXCITED: The offense is not reliant on one or two
dominant players. Leadoff hitter David Eckstein is on pace to score
107 runs, Anderson is his usual consistent self, Erstad and Salmon
have rebounded nicely from last year, Glaus is due for a power surge,
Spiezio just keeps getting on base, and Kennedy is a hit away from
batting .300.</TE>
<TE>   REASON TO BE CONCERNED: The Angels are 12-21 against teams with
winning records. After this series in Kansas City, the Angels play 20
consecutive games against Minnesota, Oakland, Seattle, Boston and the
Yankees, all with winning records.</TE>
<TE>   MOVES TO PONDER: Although scoring 15 runs in six games against
Baltimore and Tampa Bay last week might indicate the offense is
fading, and although advance scouts might soon figure out Lackey, the
Angels believe bullpen help could suffice. Francisco Rodriguez--0.55
earned-run average at triple-A Salt Lake, with 24 strikeouts in 16
innings--could be promoted even before rosters expand in September.</TE>
<TE>   SEE YOU IN SEPTEMBER: The Angels have lost 21 of their last 26
games against Seattle, including the last 12 games in Anaheim. The
Angels have lost 15 of their last 18 games against Oakland. If the
Angels cannot reverse those trends, they will extend their streak of
consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance to 16. If they can
reverse the trend, they may become the first team in major league
history to lose 14 of their first 20 games and still advance to
postseason play.</TE>

<HD>No Joy in Budville</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Selig says one team might not be able to make its
payroll next week and another is in trouble because of debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commissioner Bud Selig fired another warning shot on the eve of
baseball labor negotiations resuming, claiming a team may not be able
to make payroll Monday and another could fold during the season
because of debt, though he declined to identify the clubs or explain
how the situation would be addressed.</LD>
<LD>   Selig raised the issues during an interview Wednesday in Milwaukee
with newspaper reporters, following the doomsday theme he first
discussed in May with editors and reporters of The Times, saying then
that "six to eight [teams] can't exist another year, another year and
a half."</LD>
<LD>   Now, Selig says things are even worse, with the total debt of the
30 franchises at about $3.6 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "People want to question our losses," he said in Milwaukee. "Well,
when I met with the bankers, none of the people who have seen our
numbers question it, believe me."</TE>
<TE>   Selig said 20 of the 30 franchises have reached the limit on the
$72-million line of credit the commissioner's office established for
each team. It is believed that baseball bailed out the Arizona
Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1998, and the other 29
owners are bankrolling the Montreal Expos this season.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay is believed to be one of the two teams supposedly facing
an imminent cash-flow crisis, but there was no way to corroborate
Selig's claims in May or now. And going out of business would be the
last of many steps for a financially insolvent major sports
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   He did say that the identity of one of the teams in trouble "will
surprise you."</TE>
<TE>   It is highly unlikely that teams would be eliminated in the second
half because of scheduling issues. Moreover, players and owners are
awaiting the upcoming contraction ruling from arbitrator Shyam Das on
the grievance filed by the Major League Baseball Players Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Das hopes to reach a decision Monday, and either side could be
awarded a major bargaining chip for negotiations. Selig put off
contraction until after the 2002 season after owners repeatedly were
pummeled in the Minnesota courts, which ruled the Twins had to honor
their 2002 lease in the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   As in May at The Times, Selig strongly reiterated he would no
longer prop up struggling franchises. He said his willingness to do
so previously prompted internal criticism of him from owners of more
stable clubs and his own staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a mistake on my part," he said in Milwaukee. "Will
I do it in the future? I will not. ... Now, if a club can't make it,
I have to let it go.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a traditionalist, and I hate all that. It pains me to do it.
I just don't have any more alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   Selig's comments could be construed as a negotiation ploy, coming
on the eve of the first full negotiating session with the union since
June 27.</TE>
<TE>   Some progress has been made on three core issues: increased
revenue sharing among the clubs; a luxury tax on teams with high
payrolls; and the format of a worldwide draft. Still, there is little
to indicate that an agreement is imminent.</TE>
<TE>   In May, union leader Don Fehr said he had never heard Selig claim
six to eight clubs could go under if the system isn't changed and
refused to say whether he believed that or not. Attempts to contact
Fehr on Wednesday were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   The union's executive board did not set a strike date at a meeting
Monday in Chicago, but it requested that players on individual teams
give it the authority to set one.</TE>
<TE>   If negotiations continue to lag, players are expected to walk out
in August or September. Baseball has had eight previous work
stoppages.</TE>

<DH>Dodgers: Continued strong efforts by starting pitchers will
be the key to run for postseason berth in the second half.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Right fielder Shawn Green has provided much of the lumber, and closer
Eric Gagne has provided the ninth-inning hammer, but the National
League West-leading Dodgers are built on a foundation of starting
pitching.</LD>
<LD>   A rotation that has lacked injured ace Kevin Brown has been
anything but lacking, leading the major leagues with 44 wins, ranking
second with a 3.53 earned-run average and averaging 6 1/3 innings per
start.</LD>
<LD>   Right-hander Hideo Nomo (9-5) hasn't lost since May 12,
left-hander Odalis Perez (10-4) has pitched with the poise of a
veteran, left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii (11-5) has been dominant, though
perplexing at times, right-hander Andy Ashby (7-6) has rebounded
strongly from elbow surgery, and left-hander Omar Daal (7-4) has been
a capable, if not consistent, No. 5 starter.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers are depending on their rotation to fend off Arizona,
which opens the second half with a crucial four-game series in Dodger
Stadium beginning tonight, and San Francisco to win the division or
claim a wild-card berth that's likely to come out of the West.</TE>
<TE>   And this is where things could get dicey.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby has a career 58-50 record and 3.84 ERA in April, May, June
and July but is 28-37 with a 4.68 ERA in August and September. Nomo
was Boston's top pitcher for the first four months of 2001, going
11-4 with a 3.86 ERA, before fading down the stretch, going 2-6 with
a 5.68 ERA in August and September.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, a 23-year-old All-Star, has thrown 128 innings, 32 more
than he has thrown in any major league season, and has admitted being
fatigued in his last two starts, when he gave up 10 earned runs in 12
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii exceeded 183 innings only once in 10 years in Japan, and
Daal has been unpredictable, going 0-3 with an 11.57 ERA in three
starts after replacing Brown, 3-0 with a 1.59 ERA in his next three,
and getting shellacked for eight runs in 3 2/3 innings Sunday in St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff berths are won in August and September, but this is
unchartered territory for some Dodger pitchers, and unforgiving
grounds for others.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's an inability to focus or a lack of intensity, but it's
mostly mental," Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn said, when asked
why some pitchers fade in the final two months. "If they start
thinking about the past, what they've done, then it might affect
them. It's part of our job to keep them in the present."</TE>
<TE>   Colborn does not anticipate any kind of drop-off this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all strong competitors in their own style," Colborn said.
"When it gets down to crunch time, they buckle down and go after
hitters. We had guys in the past who tended to panic a bit, but I see
these guys getting meaner when challenged. That, to me, is the unique
thing about our rotation and pitching staff."</TE>
<TE>   There will be challenges aplenty in the coming months as the
Dodgers seek to reach the playoffs for the first time since 1996. Two
formidable ones come right out of the second-half chute, when Nomo
opposes Randy Johnson tonight and Perez faces Curt Schilling on
Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   BIGGEST FIRST-HALF SURPRISE: Gagne, with honorable mention to
first baseman Eric Karros. Gagne showed this spring he had the stuff
of a closer, and he seemed to have the mental makeup, but who could
have predicted he'd be baseball's most dominant reliever, a pitcher
with almost as many saves (32) as base-runners allowed (33)?</TE>
<TE>   The former hockey player has converted all but two save
opportunities, with a 1.39 ERA, 62 strikeouts and six walks (two
intentional), in 45 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Mixing his 98-mph fastball with a superb change-up and an
occasional curve, Gagne has limited opponents to a .167 average and
is the main reason the Dodgers are 49-0 when leading after eight
innings. One key for Manager Jim Tracy in the second half will be
pacing Gagne, so he doesn't burn out.</TE>
<TE>   Karros looked so bad in spring training, hitting .190 with no
homers, many scouts thought he was done. Two and a half months later,
Karros was batting cleanup. With his lower back sound after his
injury-plagued 2001 (.235, 15 homers, 63 RBIs), Karros is batting
.292 with nine homers and 42 RBIs, sacrificing a little power for
more consistent contact. Karros is hitting .308 with runners in
scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   BIGGEST FIRST-HALF DISAPPOINTMENT: Third baseman Adrian Beltre,
with dishonorable mention to second baseman Mark Grudzielanek. Beltre
has been an enigma, showing brief flashes of the star the Dodgers
think he can be and long stretches when he doesn't have a clue at the
plate and seems lackadaisical in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre is hitting .238 with seven homers and 29 RBIs, providing
less offense than he did in 2001, when he hit .265 with 13 homers and
60 RBIs while recovering from a botched appendectomy. He also leads
the Dodgers with 15 errors.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, battling an array of minor injuries, is hitting .245
with four homers and 28 RBIs and will likely lose playing time to
Alex Cora in the second half. With shortstop Cesar Izturis at .230,
the bottom third of the lineup has been punchless.</TE>
<TE>   DEFINING MOMENT: April 11, Pacific Bell Park, San Francisco,
bottom of the ninth, runners on first and third, one out. Gagne
strikes out cleanup batter Jeff Kent and gets Reggie Sanders to fly
to right, saving a 4-3 victory. Not that there was any doubt, but
Tracy adjourns closer-by-committee and names Gagne closer the next
day.</TE>
<TE>   "He's changed the whole dynamic of our team," Green said. "He's
shortened the game. In the sixth, seventh and eighth innings of close
games, the other teams feel him out there, just like [Yankee
opponents] do with Mariano Rivera. They know they have to score in
the innings leading up to the ninth, or it's going to be lights out."</TE>
<TE>   AT THIS PACE: Gagne would finish with 59 saves, breaking Bobby
Thigpen's major league record of 57, set for the White Sox in 1990.
Green would finish with 48 homers and 125 RBIs, remarkable
considering he was on pace for 11 homers and 79 RBIs on May 18. Green
was batting .230 with three homers and 21 RBIs in 43 games that day.
He has 23 homers and 47 RBIs in 45 games since, raising his average
to .280.</TE>
<TE>   REASONS TO BE EXCITED: Leadoff batter Dave Roberts continues to
spark the offense, hitting .302 with 20 stolen bases, catcher Paul Lo
Duca, who is hitting .326 with 23 doubles and 38 RBIs, is producing
in the No. 2 spot, right-hander Darren Dreifort, out since June of
2001 because of elbow surgery, could return in August, and Brown
could bolster the rotation if he returns from back surgery.</TE>
<TE>   REASONS TO BE CONCERNED: Left-handed batters are hitting .294 with
two homers in 34 at-bats against left-handed relief specialist Jesse
Orosco, right-hander Giovanni Carrara, one of the Dodgers' primary
setup men, has been extremely inconsistent, going 5-2 with a 3.78 ERA
and allowing 10 of 20 inherited runners to score, and Brown could be
out the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   MOVES TO PONDER: Though the Dodgers inquired about Met second
baseman Roberto Alomar, they are more focused on improving their
bench and bullpen. They've expressed interest in Texas' Frank
Catalanotto, Milwaukee's Tyler Houston and Bill Mueller of the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are also believed to be pursuing a left-handed
reliever, with Baltimore's Buddy Groom, the Mets' Mark Guthrie,
Pittsburgh's Scott Sauerbeck and Cleveland's Ricardo Rincon among the
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   SEE YOU IN SEPTEMBER: The Dodgers have not lost three in a row
since a season-opening sweep at the hands of the Giants, and though
their rotation lacks a Randy Johnson-type force, it is so deep the
Dodgers seem resistant to the lengthy losing streaks that can
devastate and demoralize teams in September. Though the rotation
doesn't have much of a late-season track record, it should overcome
that reputation and push the Dodgers into the postseason for the
first time in six years.</TE>

<HD>MLS Seeking Broader Appeal</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Commissioner wants Galaxy to become ingrained in
Latino communities to draw more fans to the league.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling Southern California a "hotbed of soccer," Major League Soccer
Commissioner Don Garber said Wednesday the league wants the Galaxy to
become more ingrained in Los Angeles' Latino communities and become a
beacon, of sorts, for Latino soccer fans to find the MLS.</LD>
<LD>   "It's something that we believe is necessary for the deep
adaptation, if you will, of the Hispanic community into American
society," said Garber, who was in town for the naming-rights ceremony
at the National Training Center in Carson, which will house the
Galaxy's 27,000-seat home beginning next season.</LD>
<LD>   "[The Galaxy] is their team as it is our team and we will strive
very hard to ... have this team be a team that the Latino community
can embrace."</LD>
<TE>   The 10-team MLS, which is run as a single entity, has placed a
prominent Mexican national player in Los Angeles since the league's
formation in 1996 hoping to appeal to the area's demographics.</TE>
<TE>   While Jorge Campos, Carlos Hermosillo and Luis Hernandez enjoyed
moderate success on the field, they failed to provide a box-office
bonanza. This is the first season the Galaxy is without a Mexican
player with name recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe it's [only] about signing Mexican players,"
Garber said. "We believe it's about having a good soccer team that's
deeply embraced within the community."</TE>
<TE>   Garber pointed to the cultural phenomena that accompanied the
arrival of former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela and Seattle
Mariner outfielder Ichiro Suzuki as blueprints for success in taking
advantage of ethnic popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you're able to get a Fernando or an Ichiro ... that person
doesn't exist for us," Garber said. "We need to gain respect and love
from the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a young Mexican-American growing up in the [American
soccer] system--Landon [Donovan] is that for the Anglo
community--rather than renting a Mexican player."</TE>
<TE>   Garber also said he's growing weary of being asked if MLS will
ever truly thrive, let alone survive.</TE>
<TE>   "The sport has made it in this country," Garber said. "There were
55,000 at a July 4 game for the Galaxy. Now, were they there to watch
fireworks as well? Absolutely, but that's no different than when they
get bobblehead dolls or they get pennants at a baseball game.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can tell me this sport [soccer] hasn't made it in this
country. It has made it. Now, it's not yet profitable and it needs to
be profitable. Baseball's not profitable, we all know that. There are
other leagues that are not profitable so I'm not sure success is
measured in profitability."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's Sept. 14 final home game against the San Jose
Earthquakes will be part of a doubleheader, with the San Diego Spirit
and Philadelphia Charge of the Women's United Soccer Assn. playing an
exhibition in the opener.... The Galaxy will open defense of its U.S.
Open Cup championship Wednesday at the Minnesota Thunder of the
A-league in a third-round game. The Thunder thumped the San Diego
Gauchos, 6-1, in the second round.</TE>

<HD>Midsummer Nightmare at Bad Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cartoon in the New Yorker shows a giant baseball-headed player,
seeking "the competitive edge," shooting up on steroids down in the
bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   The cartoon in Sports Illustrated shows a slobbering, cross-eyed
Bud Selig in oversized baseball flannels, the sport's commissioner
made up as a sideshow buffoon, stumbling as he tries to dodge the
baseballs and invective hurled at him from the angry fans in the
stands.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball came to Milwaukee for the All-Star break, put on its
annual feel-good exhibition game--and this year's supposed shelter
from the storm--and promptly got with the program, morphing into a
not-all-that-funny caricature of itself.</LD>
<TE>   In a summer clouded by talk of a baseball strike, the 73rd
All-Star game, thoughtfully enough, came equipped with its own work
stoppage. Game halted after 11 innings, all the best players in the
game left standing idly by, no final resolution in sight--kind of
like what happened to the 1994 season, the last time an All-Star game
proceeded amid talk of a baseball strike.</TE>
<TE>   The game was halted, with the score tied, 7-7, because both teams
had run out of pitchers. Of course. Isn't that the trouble with big
league baseball in the year 2002--not enough pitching?</TE>
<TE>   With that, the superstars of the sport, many of them richer than
Third World countries, many of them rumored to be addled on steroids
or amphetamines, were left in suspended animation, much like the
game's great legend who recently passed on and was sent to the
ultimate retirement home in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   And then Selig, the man who brought baseball back to Milwaukee
after the Braves bailed for Atlanta, the man who orchestrated the
construction of the beautiful new stadium that brought the All-Star
game back to Milwaukee, huddled inside the National League dugout to
avoid being struck by trash and seat cushions flung long distances by
angry fans who evidently are emulating their heroes and bulking up on
the body-building supplements.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to send Ted Williams spinning in his grave, except
Williams has been frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it is now official: Nothing in baseball is sacred anymore.
The heirs to Teddy Ballgame's estate saw to that by taking the legacy
of the game's last .400 hitter, one of the proudest men to have ever
swung a bat, and submerged it in liquid nitrogen, turning it into
some unfathomable "They Saved Hitler's Brain" sci-fi B-movie parody
that has served up countless freeze-play punch lines for the
late-night comics of America.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Scottsdale's Alcor Life Extension Foundation
facility, where Williams' remains are now chilling, say their
long-term objective is to preserve a "patient" until a cure for
whatever caused his demise is discovered, with that new science then
applied to restore the subject to a state of vibrant health.</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm.</TE>
<TE>   Is there room in Alcor's neighborhood for another client? Named:
Major League Baseball.</TE>
<TE>   One way or another, the big freeze is coming, most likely when
players union head Donald Fehr tells his constituents he has heard
enough sky-is-falling, help-save-ourselves-from-ourselves rhetoric
from the owners and sets a formal strike date.</TE>
<TE>   There will be much gnashing of teeth. There will be much screaming
on talk shows. But if and when baseball takes its time out, maybe
even blowing out another World Series along the way, it eventually
will come back, just as it has after each of its eight previous work
stoppages since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Last time, baseball cured itself by transforming into a
kid-friendly 162-episode version of "Home Run Derby"--a quick fix
that lured back many fed-up fans who swore they had sworn off the
game after the strike of '94.</TE>
<TE>   The Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run chase of '98 was hard to
resist. Barry Bonds' grim-faced march of 2001 was less so. Now, many
are wondering if the cure was worse than the disease--if the players,
in order to pump new life into their self-destructive pastime, have
simply pumped up artificially on steroids and other muscle enhancers,
damaging their health along with the sport's integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Two former MVPs, Ken Caminiti and Jose Canseco, place the number
of active steroid users in the majors today between 50% (Caminiti's
claim) and 85% (Canseco's). Neither charge can be proven, not until
baseball adopts some sort of drug-testing policy, another snag
contributing to the current standoff between the players and the
owners. But the damage has been done.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the allegations by Caminiti and Canseco, who
doesn't look at Bonds' remarkable 2001 performance--73 home runs at
age 38--in a different light? Or McGwire's record-breaking 1998? We
already know the muscle-builder androstenedione was on McGwire's
training table en route to those 70 home runs. But was that all?</TE>
<TE>   Sosa already had to resist the urge to go deep on the skull of a
grandstanding magazine columnist who challenged the Chicago Cub
slugger to have himself drug tested. Sensing this cheap stunt had
more to do with enhancing the columnist's reputation than his own,
Sosa refused. More impressively, he permitted the columnist to leave
the Cubs' locker room under his own powers, upright and still
ambulatory.</TE>
<TE>   There is another performance enhancer out there, perfectly legal
and permissible, and if you listen to Selig for more than 10 seconds,
he will assure you it's just as dangerous. It is called money. The
New York Yankees have it in scads, they make no pretense about it,
they flaunt it and exploit it and have come close to making this
baseball season a moot point, with or without any work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the Yankees lost the World Series to the Arizona
Diamondbacks, in seven thrilling games, in a series that reversed a
long trend of sagging TV numbers and was branded an instant classic.
Selig took one look at this potential public-relations bonanza and
rolled out the wet blanket--within two days of the final out, Selig
was talking about eliminating two franchises, probably the Minnesota
Twins and the Montreal Expos, who were eventually allowed to play on
and are now contending for the playoffs. Despite that, Selig
continues to yammer on about six to eight teams going bankrupt or out
of business, essentially eliminating themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees, meanwhile, decided to expand. Using their World
Series defeat as inspiration to not let it happen again, the Yankees
added Jason Giambi, Robin Ventura, Rondell White and Steve
Karsay--and arrived at the All-Star break with the best record in the
major leagues. Not satisfied, the Yankees prepared for the break by
super-sizing even more--bringing in outfielder Raul Mondesi from
Toronto and pitcher Jeff Weaver from Detroit and, presumably, mapping
out the route for the 2002 World Series victory parade.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about the game, with the notable exception of
attendance, which is down nearly 6% from last season, creaks of
bloat. Salaries are bloated. Players are bloated. Baseball itself is
threatening to burst at the seams, filled to the breaking point by
Selig's hot air and the steam emanating from the owners' cooked
books.</TE>
<TE>   Even the All-Star game was bloated. What else can you call it when
11 innings are not enough to decide an outcome, when seven runs are
not enough to declare a winner, when 60 players are not enough to
finish the job?</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, the Yankees came to Milwaukee with six
All-Stars, and did not leave with any more.</TE>

<HD>Maldini's Retirement Could Be Premature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps Paolo Maldini will not be retiring after all. The veteran
defender, who has played a record 126 games for Italy in a 14-year
international career, said he would step aside after the World Cup,
but Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni wants him to reconsider.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope that he will stay on with us," Trapattoni was quoted as
saying in Wednesday's edition of Gazzetta dello Sport. "He needs to
tell me how he feels and whether he has the desire or not. I won't be
sending him into retirement, though."</LD>
<LD>   Trapattoni's interest is not entirely altruistic. He believes the
34-year-old Maldini's experience is vital with qualifying play set to
begin in September for the 2004 European Championship in Portugal.</LD>
<TE>   Italy plays Azerbaijan, Finland, Wales and Yugoslavia in its Euro
2004 qualifying group.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in Egypt</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Alberto Torres, who won a World Cup with Brazil in 1970 and
later played in the defunct North American Soccer League with the New
York Cosmos and the California Surf, has been named coach of one of
Egypt's leading clubs, Zamalek. Torres, 58, replaces Otto Pfister of
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Another top Egyptian club, Al-Ahly, also has changed coaches, with
Portugal's Manuel Jose being shown the door and Dutchman Jo Bonfrere
taking over. Bonfrere coached Nigeria to the gold medal at the 1996
Atlanta Olympics but was fired by the Super Eagles last year after
Nigeria lost a World Cup qualifying match to Sierra Leone.</TE>
<TE>   AEK Goes Costa Rican</TE>
<TE>   The Greek club AEK Athens has signed a second player from Costa
Rica's World Cup team, acquiring midfielder Walter Centeno from
Deportivo Saprissa for an undisclosed sum.</TE>
<TE>   Centeno, 27, a national team veteran with 53 games to his credit,
agreed to a five-year contract. He joins Costa Rican defender
Mauricio Wright, signed by AEK last week.</TE>
<TE>   AWOL Forwards</TE>
<TE>   At least two South American World Cup players are in trouble with
their club teams for going AWOL since Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   Gremio of Brazil said it would fine Brazil forward Luizao $174,000
for breach of contract after he failed to show up for training this
week as the team prepared for a Copa Libertadores match at Olimpia of
Paraguay.</TE>
<TE>   In England, meanwhile, Southampton Coach Gordon Strachan is
bemused by the continuing absence of Ecuador striker Augustin
Delgado, who scored his country's first-ever World Cup goal, against
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking into it," Strachan said. "It's frustrating for me
because it's clear that he has the ability, which he showed with the
goal he scored at the World Cup. But the club has spent millions of
pounds on the player and I've only seen him train five times since I
came here."</TE>
<TE>   Because of knee surgery, Delgado, 29, played in only two games in
England last season and has said he does not want to return.</TE>
<TE>   MetroStars Denied Injunction</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer's New York/New Jersey MetroStars were turned
down in their quest to gain an injunction against the New Jersey
Sports and Exhibition Authority that would have prevented the sports
authority from promoting games at Giants Stadium on Aug. 8 and 21.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Sakiewicz, team president and general manager, said the
ruling by New Jersey Superior Court Judge Marguerite Simon would be
appealed.</TE>
<TE>   The MetroStars wanted to promote games of their own on the two
dates and the MLS club has a suit pending against the sports
authority in which it is trying to get the soccer exclusivity clause
in its lease with Giants Stadium enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Riquelme Joins Barcelona</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona has signed Argentine midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme from
Boca Juniors, but for less than half the amount originally estimated.
The 24-year-old, who signed a five-year contract worth a reported $3
million a year, cost Barcelona $5.9 million, according to Joan
Gaspart, Barcelona's president. Boca Juniors had earlier said
Riquelme would join the Spanish club for $12.8 million.</TE>

<HD>Goldstein Concerns Title IX Supporters</HD>
<DH>Government: Chicago attorney, who has represented
plaintiffs challenging sexual discrimination law, is appointed to
high post in office that enforces it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARYANN HUDSON HARVEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If leading proponents of Title IX weren't already fearful of the Bush
administration's motives last month, when formation of a panel to
reevaluate the law was announced, they now have this to consider:
Chicago attorney Lou Goldstein, who has represented male athletes in
litigation against colleges challenging Title IX, was recently named
to a high post in the very office that enforces it.</LD>
<LD>   Title IX, enacted 30 years ago, prohibits sex discrimination in
federally funded education programs, including athletics, and is
generally credited with having greatly increased opportunities for
girls and women in school sports.</LD>
<LD>   On April 29, Goldstein was appointed by U.S. Education Secretary
Roderick Paige as deputy assistant secretary for policy in the Office
for Civil Rights, although that appointment was not announced by the
Department of Education.</LD>
<TE>   "[Paige] hired someone who is familiar with Title IX and the
statutes and the regulations that emanate from this department,"
Brian Jones, chief counsel to Paige, said Tuesday. "Policy is going
to be set by the secretary and the president. We are here to serve
them, and they have made it unequivocally clear of their support for
Title IX."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the department, however, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Goldstein had been brought in under "a cloak of
darkness."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of stuff going on and no one is paying attention
because they are too wrapped up in the flag," the source said. "It's
like there's an elephant standing in the middle of the [Education]
office, doing its thing, and everyone is just walking around it,
ignoring it."</TE>
<TE>   Requests to interview Goldstein, Paige or Gerald Reynolds, who
heads the Office for Civil Rights, were instead handled by Jones.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's announcement June 27 of a Commission on
Opportunity in Athletics brought public outcry from proponents of
Title IX. The commission includes 15 athlete representatives and
academicians charged with reevaluating the law. The panel includes
athletes and some supporters of Title IX, but some proponents are
skeptical, pointing out that the administration's platform for the
2000 election had a plank supporting an approach to Title IX that
would expand women's opportunities without adversely affecting men's
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not familiar with Lou Goldstein, but it doesn't surprise me
that he was hired," said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the
Women's Sports Foundation. "It is clear that the Bush administration
is seeking a way to weaken Title IX. It was clear when they included
a plank on the Republican platform that specifically addressed Title
IX."</TE>
<TE>   Some men's groups maintain that Title IX has led to reverse
discrimination, resulting in elimination of men's teams.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein, a partner in the Chicago firm he founded, Goldstein &amp;
Fluxgold, P.C., unsuccessfully represented male soccer players and
wrestlers in a reverse sexual discrimination suit against Illinois
State University, which dropped the men's teams and added a women's
team to comply with Title IX. In a similar suit, he represented male
athletes against Miami of Ohio, which eliminated three men's varsity
sports to comply with Title IX.</TE>
<TE>   Courts have repeatedly denied challenges to Title IX, which are
traditionally brought against educational institutions. Currently,
the Department of Education is being sued by the National Wrestling
Coaches Assn. and other groups claiming that Title IX policies impose
quotas and discriminate against men. This suit, brought on the 30th
anniversary of Title IX, prompted the Bush administration to form the
reevaluating panel, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Paige says the panel's recommendations won't automatically be
adopted.</TE>
<TE>   "Some would like to settle this in the courts," Paige said when
announcing formation of the commission. "But we believe the better
approach is to discuss all the questions openly, in a forum where all
voices and all viewpoints can be heard."</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, has taken issue with that.</TE>
<TE>   "On one hand, Paige talked about concern that this is not a quota
bill, but then he says that this is an issue that shouldn't be
resolved in the courts," she said. "This is a concern, since every
court has upheld Title IX. The kinds of interpretations that
wrestlers and others have been urging, if in place, would arrest any
development of women's athletic opportunities and put into place the
status quo of the early '70s."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cynthia Cooper, who co-chairs the panel with Stanford
Athletic Director Ted Leland, "We are charged with assessing the
equal opportunities in athletics for men and women. We might find out
everything is fine, that Title IX is working perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to take a look at it."</TE>

<HD>Spaniard Rides to the Front</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Gonzalez de Galdeano takes lead. Three-time
defending champion Armstrong trails by seven seconds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHATEAU-THIERRY, France</DL>
<LD>Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano is in the hot saddle now.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez de Galdeano took the Tour de France's overall lead by
virtue of his Once team's smooth, impressive victory in Wednesday's
team time trial in 1 hour 19 minutes 49 seconds. It is the first time
a Spanish rider has worn the leader's yellow jersey since Miguel
Indurain mounted the last of his five podiums in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   That could put pressure on the 28-year-old, as his countrymen
would love to see him wearing that same hue when the race moves into
the Pyrenees eight days from now. Gonzalez de Galdeano is well aware
of that, and he downplayed the honor after Stage 4.</LD>
<TE>   "As far as the race goes, the lead doesn't mean anything [to me],"
he said. "Obviously, it means something to the team."</TE>
<TE>   Although Gonzalez de Galdeano beat defending champion Lance
Armstrong in an individual time trial earlier this year, he isn't
exactly tooting his horn.</TE>
<TE>   "Armstrong is another level above me," the Spaniard said. "I'm
going well, but he's super."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Postal's second-place finish, 15 seconds behind pre-stage
favorite Once, leaves Armstrong lurking where he wants to be--on
Gonzalez de Galdeano's wheel, in third place, seven seconds behind.
Joseba Beloki of Once rode his team's coattails into second overall.</TE>
<TE>   The team time trial can help a rider with aspirations for a good
overall finish, but it has far more power to hurt. Armstrong is
content to lie in wait until the mountain stages, a strategy that has
worked for him in the last two Tours. He and team director Johan
Bruyneel each expressed relief at surviving the 41.9-mile test
without mishap.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little surprised, but I'm not disappointed," Armstrong told
French television.</TE>
<TE>   Bruyneel said he was satisfied even though he would have been
happier with a victory. "I know we have a good team, but I knew it
would be a very tight contest with [Once]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The major subplot involved veteran French rider Laurent Jalabert,
who saw his chances of wearing the yellow jersey again--he is 33 and
may not have many more shots at it--shrink considerably.</TE>
<TE>   CSC-Tiscali, the Danish team co-piloted by Jalabert and
Massachusetts native Tyler Hamilton, faltered when Danish time-trial
champion Michael Sanstoed had to have a flat front tire replaced
about 12 miles from the finish.</TE>
<TE>   CSC had already lost one rider, and there was confusion--increased
by faulty radio communication--about whether to wait or press on.</TE>
<TE>   Jalabert didn't try to mask his disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes three times that I've been close to the yellow jersey
[this year], and it's really too bad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton said the team had executed its tactical plan well to that
point. "We really needed Michael in the final flat, so it was our
goal to get him over the climb without him suffering too much," he
said. "When he flatted, none of us knew it. We soft-pedaled for about
30 or 45 seconds, and it was just wasted time."</TE>

<HD>Their Relationship Often Has Been Icy</HD>
<DH>Williams: Son John Henry's dominating style angered family
members, even before dispute over body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE and DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Henry Williams didn't surprise some members of his family by
whisking away the body of his deceased Hall of Fame father and having
it delivered to a cryonics laboratory for freezing.</LD>
<LD>   Sherri Mosley, granddaughter of baseball great Ted Williams, said
Wednesday that John Henry first mentioned his controversial plan to
family members 17 months ago, following a tour of Scottsdale,
Ariz.-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation while his father was
still in a San Diego hospital recovering from open-heart surgery.</LD>
<LD>   With his abrasive, dominating style, John Henry had offended his
relatives before. But the idea of freezing his father's remains and
perhaps someday selling his DNA for the purposes of cloning put an
unprecedented strain on family ties.</LD>
<TE>   Mosley said her mother, Bobby-Jo Ferrell, "absolutely didn't
agree" and "wouldn't even speak" about it to her half brother.</TE>
<TE>   The family didn't go public with John Henry's plan, she added,
because they weren't convinced he would follow through. Now that he
has, they are talking.</TE>
<TE>   "[Ferrell] told him she would go to the press, but he didn't
believe her," Mosley said in a telephone interview from her White
House, Tenn., home. "We wanted everyone to understand how crazy and
immoral this is, especially because it's not what [Ted Williams]
wanted. He would never agree to this."</TE>
<TE>   John Henry, 33, has not conducted an interview since his father's
death at age 83 Friday. He was a no-show at a pregame ceremony
honoring "Teddy Ballgame," baseball's last .400 hitter, before
Tuesday's All-Star game in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley said John Henry is with his sister, Claudia, but has
disconnected the phone at the Inverness, Fla., home he used to share
with his father.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, 33, contends John Henry's decision to disobey his father's
wish to be cremated--Ferrell contends the request is written in the
former Boston Red Sox great's will--continues his pattern of
manipulation and dominance.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry is one of two children Ted Williams had with Dolores
Wettach, a former Vogue model and one of his three wives. He studied
business at the University of Maine and began conducting his father's
business affairs in the early 1990s after a failed venture in which
Ted Williams lost nearly $40,000 in cash in a memorabilia deal with a
convicted felon.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, John Henry was signed--as a favor to his father--by
the Red Sox, who assigned him to their lowest-level minor league
team, in Fort Myers, Fla. He'd failed in two previous tries to catch
on with professional baseball teams.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry was mending a broken rib--sustained when he awkwardly
crashed into a railing--when his father died of heart failure.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry's parents split when he was 6. His mother relocated to
a spread in Vermont. John Henry told Sports Illustrated in a 1996
article that he was able to visit his father once a year until he
reached high school, when he'd spend summers with "The Splendid
Splinter."</TE>
<TE>   Despite John Henry's business education, some of his strategies
failed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, after Williams had struck a $2-million deal with Upper
Deck Authenticated, John Henry, who had created a clearinghouse
company of his father's photos, autographs and jerseys called Grand
Slam Marketing, started a company that competed with Upper Deck.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of encouraging his father to sign memorabilia for Upper
Deck, John Henry arranged for him to autograph products associated
with his own venture, Ted Williams Card Company. A 1995 court
settlement dissolved the company.</TE>
<TE>   The Ted Williams Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame opened in
Hernando, Fla., in February 1994. A month later, following his
father's third stroke, John Henry closed the Ted Williams Store he
owned in Chestnut Hill, Mass., and moved into his father's home.</TE>
<TE>   "John Henry obviously handles Ted Williams' affairs, everything
goes through him, and he's a tough businessman, but I say that in a
complimentary way," said Bill Williams (no relation), the executive
director of the six-year-old Louisville Slugger Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "When we opened our museum, we were scheduled to have 18 Hall of
Famers. When I asked John Henry if Ted could come, he said no, that
'Dad doesn't travel after that last stroke.' But then he called back
and said, 'Dad said he'll be there, that he'll do anything for
[Louisville Slugger founders] Hillerich and Bradsby.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bill Williams said he is in the process of negotiating a deal with
John Henry that will allow for full-size replicas of Ted Williams'
Louisville Sluggers to be sold in the museum's gift store.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, these deals we've done with [Mickey] Mantle's family and
[Roger] Maris' family have taken a couple weeks," Bill Williams said.
"This one with John Henry is working on six months. He's stronger
than a rope. I think John Henry feels his family has been ripped off,
so he has clamped down. He's very, very strict."</TE>
<TE>   John Henry prides himself as a supreme identifier of forged
autographs and fake memorabilia, especially of those items affiliated
with his father. He even sued his sister Claudia earlier this year
for $1.3 million over the sale of autographed bats to a collector.</TE>
<TE>   One of John Henry's fiercest critics is Phil Castinetti, owner of
the Everett, Mass.-based Sportsworld, a sports memorabilia shop
Castinetti identifies as New England's largest. It formerly competed
for business with the Ted Williams Store.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry, Castinetti said, "will do anything for a buck, and
you're seeing that again right now. He has had so much power over his
father. The more money he made, the more he wanted. He didn't care
about his father as much as he cared about wanting to make money off
of him."</TE>
<TE>   Castinetti and two others were arrested by Boston police in a
December 1997 sting operation and charged with possession of stolen
property--Ted Williams' ring from the 1946 World Series and an
honorary 1986 World Series ring given to him by the Red Sox. They
were later acquitted. Rodney Nichols, an acquaintance of John
Henry's, was sentenced to six months of house arrest for transporting
stolen property over state lines. The rings were eventually returned
to John Henry.</TE>
<TE>   "For a time, I thought I was John Henry's best friend, but he
turned on me, and I've always wondered where he'd stop when it came
to money or friendship," Nichols said. "Obviously, with what's going
on now, you wonder if he'll ever stop."</TE>
<TE>   Grand Slam Marketing and another John Henry business creation,
www.hitters.net, have failed, but all accounts indicate John Henry is
living comfortably.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Pressman, who says he was a longtime friend of Ted
Williams, said John Henry blocked several friends from visiting his
father at home. Castinetti also said there is suspicion in the
memorabilia industry that John Henry has forged some of his father's
signatures. In the Sports Illustrated article, John Henry said,
"Plenty of people think [that]."</TE>
<TE>   "John Henry needs a good Irish kick in the [rear]," Pressman said.
"He's not what you'd expect from Ted Williams, whose word was
golden."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley's chief concern is winning a court fight to remove her
grandfather from the cryonics laboratory. Attorneys for Williams'
estate plan to file Williams' will with the Florida courts this week,
said John Heer, a lawyer for Ferrell.</TE>
<TE>   Heer said Williams wanted to be cremated and have his ashes
scattered in the Florida Keys, where he often fished.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley said John Henry had a restraining order in place barring
her from visiting Ted Williams before his death, but Citrus County
(Fla.) Sheriff's Lt. Joe Eckstein said, "There are no records of an
existing restraining order and no history of a trespassing warning,
either."</TE>
<TE>   Friday, shortly after 10 a.m., Ferrell received a phone call from
the local hospital saying her father had died. She and Mosley,
getting reports from a friend at the hospital, had an inkling of what
would happen next.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty-seven minutes later, [Ferrell] called back and was told
that he was already packed in ice," Mosley said. "Forty-seven
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley said she knows John Henry, who has been heavily criticized
in Boston and elsewhere, is under intense scrutiny. "But he brought
it on himself," she added. "He should have known it was going to
cause him a great deal of grief.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been outrageous. We haven't had time to grieve."</TE>

<DH>A 1950s landmark clings to life along Route66 in Rialto,

<LD>Home is a green concrete tepee on a boulevard of barred buildings and
weedy lots. Rudy Rios arrived late at the Wigwam Motel--50 years
after it became a novelty stopping place for families driving west to
Los Angeles. He got here the way so many guests now do, through
hardship, after a divorce left him homeless.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes," Rios said, "you come out with nothing."</LD>
<LD>   The Wigwam would be just another low-rent motel on Foothill
Boulevard, at the Rialto and San Bernardino border, if not for its
striking architecture and iconic status on historic Route 66. The 20
tepees left over from 1950 are all 30 feet tall and clustered like an
Indian village. The motel's new management has repainted them--blue,
red, lilac, yellow and pink--and put in fresh carpet, microwaves and
small refrigerators. The air conditioners are working again.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the Wigwam's decline all but blazes in neon. The pool is
empty even in the summer heat, barricaded by a chain-link fence. The
lawn is dead. The roadside marquee--which suggested, "Do It in a
Tepee"--is broken out, and the wooden Indian below it is badly
splintered.</TE>
<TE>   Few cars cross the cracked asphalt on weekdays, despite room rates
of $45 a night. Fridays and Saturdays get busier, partly because of
nightclubs in Rialto.</TE>
<TE>   Rios, a 52-year-old machinist, moved in nearly two years ago. He
and his girlfriend, Jennie, pay by the week--a little less than $200.
For a while, he was embarrassed by his address. But the Wigwam is no
worse than a studio apartment. The grounds are quiet, no longer the
domain of young children.</TE>
<TE>   The tepees are roomier than they appear. He and Jennie have a
queen-size bed, a small table with chairs, a full-size refrigerator
and a bathroom. Blue curtains frame a tiny window covered by exterior
bars. Over the bed hang a framed picture of Jesus, and--on the
ceiling--a broken mirror. Every tepee has a mirror above the bed.</TE>
<TE>   "For two people, it's great. This is ideal," Rios said. He has
watched movies being filmed. People still drive by to snap pictures.
Managers are "trying to build it back up," Rios said, "and they
should, because a lot of our landmarks are being torn down."</TE>
<TE>   At least two Wigwam motels are known to exist; another is in
Holbrook, Ariz. A chain once extended as far east as Kentucky, where
the original Wigwam was built in the 1940s, according to Jim Heimann,
author of "California Crazy and Beyond: Roadside Vernacular
Architecture." Buildings shaped like giant toads, dogs, windmills and
the like--which proliferated more than half a century ago--are nearly
gone now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always shocked," Heimann said, "whenever these buildings
manage to stay up."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Conkle, executive director of the California Route 66
Preservation Foundation, noted that the famed thoroughfare from
Chicago to Los Angeles gave rise to innumerable examples of
outlandish design and popularized roadside neon. After crossing the
Mojave Desert, families of the 1950s often spent their last night on
the road at the Wigwam before motoring on toward Disneyland, Conkle
said.</TE>
<TE>   The pouring of the San Bernardino Freeway in the 1970s, a few
miles away, drained the lifeblood from the highway. The Wigwam's
owner, Chen Lung Kuo, paid $235,000 for the property in 1993. He
leases it to Suresh Patel, who funded recent improvements and
installed his son, Manish Patel, as manager.</TE>
<TE>   Manish lives in the only tepee with a TV antenna sticking out the
top. He sleeps on a blanket on the floor. His TV shares space with a
lone security monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Patel, who is well-liked by the long-term guests, turns away a
sizable share of the prospective patrons because he doesn't want
prostitution or drug abuse in the rooms. To help with refurbishment,
he allows Jay Johnson, 51, to stay for free in an orange tepee near
the highway in exchange for doing painting and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the lawn, Johnson admitted that the sprinkler system
is ruined. "I had it up and running last year, or the year before,"
he said. "But when customers come, especially kids, they kick the
sprinklers and break them."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson spoke evasively about his past. He moved out here from
South Los Angeles. He was married once. "That's over," he said, "and
it's all personal."</TE>
<TE>   Some guests express a nostalgic affection for the Wigwam. Frank
Estrada, who will turn 40 next week, spoke fondly about his first
stay, in 1964. His family had left Lewiston, Maine, to move west, and
"we came right here. As a matter of fact, it was the next room over."
The tepees featured patterned Indian carpet then, and fire pits
outside.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada, a railroad employee, is back after all these years
because of being laid off. His wife, Yrayna, who supports them both
with her job at Molly Maid, was not exactly thrilled to be moving
into the cone-shaped room two months ago, but she's grown to like the
place. "It's quiet--no traffic going in and out."</TE>
<TE>   "She's fascinated with the mirror," Estrada joked. The other
guests are mostly like themselves, he said. "People in transition,
between jobs. People passing through."</TE>
