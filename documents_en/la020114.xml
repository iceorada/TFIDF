<LD>Take a look at these three guys. At least two of them may be coming
back soon, to a fund-raiser near you.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis has raised more than $7 million from out-of-state
contributors, many of them from New York, his home state. This sort
of thing happens a lot here; Republican Bob Dornan, the former
firecracker congressman from Orange County, collected nearly seven of
every 10 campaign dollars from out of state.</LD>
<LD>   But in a switcheroo, a couple of guys running for governor of New
York are circulating among the sushi-at-sunset crowd in California,
bagging Golden State loot for their Empire State campaigns. Democrat
Andrew Cuomo, son of the former N.Y. governor Mario, raked it in at a
$2,500-a-noggin Beverly Hills fund-raiser last week. One of the
$10,000 sponsors for the event was Hustler magazine Publisher Larry
Flynt, drawing murmurings from a New York GOP pol about "naked
ambition."</LD>
<TE>   The man who chased Cuomo the Elder out of Albany, Gov. George
Pataki, was here last May on a four-day package tour that included
his own $2,500-per chow-down, preceded by a $1,000 cocktail reception
(for that price one hopes the cocktails were free). New York papers
reported that our own former Gov. Pete Wilson was one of two honorary
chairs of the Pataki fund-raiser--and a no-show. Pataki opposed
Wilson's anti-immigration Proposition 187.</TE>
<TE>   Now, look at the pictures again. Cuomo and Pataki are the ones
running. But be alert, Californians: The man on the right may look
rather like Pataki, but he is former pro basketball whiz and ex-New
Jersey Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley. He ran for president in 2000
and, who knows, may do so again, and come calling for California
cash.</TE>
<TE>   Dirty Politics: Time to Clean Up the Grammar</TE>
<TE>   All of the leading GOP gov candidates are running as leaders in
improving education, but some of their campaigns could use a
refresher course:</TE>
<TE>   Richard Riordan's campaign sent out a press release headlined:
"RIORDAN CAMPAIGN LAUNCHES FIRST ADS OF GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN AND
UNVIELS NEW WEBSITE." That must be "unveils"; a campaign with so much
dough can surely afford a proofreader, or at least a better spell
check. But that wouldn't have caught the mistake on Riordan's Web
site. Listed among the business and community leaders supporting him
is one "Nancy Reardon"--his wife, Nancy Daly Riordan. Memo to
Webmaster: Have you considered another line of work? Soon?</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon's campaign sent out a press release noting, "Attached
is the summery page of Bill Simon's campaign disclosure statement"--a
mistake, or global warming setting in?</TE>
<TE>   The trend that began in the Beltway has now reached the Pacific
shore. Rather than using the correct adjective "Democratic" to
describe the opposition party, lest someone think they really mean
small-d "democratic," Republican pols and polemicists have taken to
saying "Democrat Party," preferring to be grammatically wrong and
politically right.</TE>
<TE>   And on the subject of grammar, President Bush, at last weekend's
town hall meeting in Ontario, declared that "not over my dead body"
would taxes be raised, which means the opposite of the metaphor he
sought.</TE>
<TE>   That glitch hasn't stopped California Republicans, from
gov-wannabe Bill Jones to party Chairman Shawn Steel, from taunting
Gray Davis for declaring carefully in his State of the State speech
that he would "not advocate raising taxes," with no mention of bodies
dead or living.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan on Davis: View From the Other Side</TE>
<TE>   Richard Riordan watched Davis' speech across the street from the
Capitol, in a suite at the Hyatt, a hotel whose threshold good
Democrats never cross because of the picket lines from a years-long
labor set-to, but where Republicans love to disport themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan invited supporters and reporters in for the speech. At one
point he praised Davis for saying California needs to "put children
first." When Davis fired a direct salvo at the former L.A. mayor and
his prosperous Department of Water and Power by declaring that
"merchant generators--even some of our own municipal utilities--were
gouging us unconscionably," Riordan threw up his hands and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   Then he retreated to a private room for 20 minutes of briefings,
and returned like a team after a locker room halftime, giving forth
the made-for-TV sound bite retort to Davis' pledge to solve the
budget crisis the way he solved the energy crisis: "I hope not."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' aides riposted to GOP slashes by e-mailing budget
statistics comparing inflation and state employee-creep under Davis
and a governor by the name of Ronald Reagan. Guess who came out
looking fiscally rosier?</TE>
<TE>   Davis' speech had some awkward moments as he paused at applause
lines for clapping that did not come, until his aides, standing at
the back of the Assembly chamber, at last began the clapping-on-cue,
a hint for legislators to follow.</TE>
<TE>   A Tell-Almost Book of GOP Life in O.C.</TE>
<TE>   As chairwoman emeritus of the Orange County Republican Party, Lois
Lundberg has seen and heard plenty over the years--but you won't read
all about it in her new book, "The Big Orange: 50 Years of Republican
Political Life."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of things in it that I hope will prove interesting.
But no scandal," she says. The 285-page book is sold through the
Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and local party offices in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   How nice is it? She writes kindly of the press, and even of the
dead. The political implosion of John G. Schmitz--conservative
congressman and national director of the John Birch Society--was news
to the rest of us, especially as it was hastened along in 1982 by
word that Schmitz had two children by a longtime mistress.</TE>
<TE>   But to Lundberg, "These were real people to me. These were
personal friendships," and writing about them "was hard."</TE>
<TE>   A Little Foggy in the Time Department</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's ranking Democrat strolled in very publicly and
very late indeed to Gray Davis' State of the State speech--he may
have caught the last five minutes. San Francisco Democratic Sen. John
Burton demurred prettily afterward, claiming that fog and traffic and
his new status as a grandpa required him to drive very cautiously
indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights later, Burton begged off lending an ear to GOP
candidate Richard Riordan. Burton gave his speech to a civil-rights
group in Oakland and then didn't hang around for Riordan's, for fear,
he said in ironic voice, that the governor was ''really going to be
mad.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Dick promised to give me not only a video of his speech tonight,
but a video of Gray Davis' State of the State address, which will
mean I won't have to buy melatonin for about a month,'' Burton told
the audience.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Burton, taking his own sweet time again, endorsed
Davis on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Presidential Seal Was Safe With Him</TE>
<TE>   When CNN reported that the official presidential seal had been
stolen last week after President Bush's speech in Ontario, former
Corona Mayor Al Lopez fessed up to police: The seal was safe and
sound and still round--and at his house.</TE>
<TE>   Corona Police Lt. Kelly Anderson said Lopez called "right away" to
find out what to do with the seal. He had grabbed it off the
presidential podium at the end of the town hall meeting.</TE>
<TE>   A local press account quotes Lopez as saying he was "just trying
to save a national symbol" from disappearing--presumably to some
house less scrupulous than his. The seal was speedily returned to the
Secret Service.</TE>
<TE>   Did Lopez succumb to temptation and have himself photographed with
it? Only his photo processor knows for sure ....</TE>

<HD>Salving a Workplace Pain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People who develop a type of injury caused by such repetitive actions
as chopping chicken carcasses or hammering away at computer keyboards
cannot sue their employers to force workplace accommodations under
the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Supreme Court ruled last
week. The unanimous decision reflects a sound interpretation of the
1990 measure, which Congress intended to protect an estimated 43
million Americans with mental or physical disabilities from
discrimination in jobs, housing and access to public facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Employers, however, would be foolish to view the court's ruling,
which hinged on the definition of "disability," as an excuse to avoid
making ergonomic improvements. And until federal and state lawmakers
do a better job of addressing the workplace conditions that give rise
to this often excruciating injury, litigation and frustration will
escalate.</LD>
<TE>   Ella Williams, the plaintiff in the court case, had worked with
power tools on a Kentucky auto assembly line. She developed carpal
tunnel syndrome, intense pain in her wrists and shoulders, as a
result of the repetitive motions her job involved. When pain made it
impossible for her to work, Williams got medical treatment and some
benefits from Kentucky's workers' compensation system. She wanted to
return to the job, but because her doctor told her not to lift more
than 20 pounds she asked to be assigned lighter duties, such as
inspecting cars. Her employer, Toyota Motors, refused. She quit and
sued the company under the disabilities act, claiming that her
injuries were so severe as to constitute a disability like blindness
or paraplegia.</TE>
<TE>   The high court said no. A disabled person must have a "permanent
or long-term" impairment, the court held, not an injury that is
likely to heal.</TE>
<TE>   Many farsighted businesses have redesigned jobs or workstations in
recent years to minimize repetitive motion injuries. Other companies
contend that such changes would be too costly and that some workers
who claim to have back or shoulder problems, for example, may not
have hurt themselves on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Some business leaders and others, including Eugene Scalia, whom
President Bush appointed Friday as the top lawyer for the Labor
Department, go so far as to voice skepticism that ergonomic injuries
exist at all--a view about as valid as doubting that the planet is
round.</TE>
<TE>   Vehement pressure from business pushed Congress last year to kill
federal ergonomic rules passed by the Clinton administration.
Fortunately, equally fervent reaction from unions prompted Labor
Secretary Elaine Chao to promise she would take another look at the
problem. Tuesday's high court  decision should push her to move
quickly.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Borrowing Spree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are things not to like about Gov. Gray Davis' $100-billion
budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, and both Democrats and
Republicans in the Legislature are pointing them out with vigor. But
considering that the state has been spending more than it is taking
in, something had to give.</LD>
<LD>   The recession has caused a yawning, $12.5-billion state revenue
gap. Properly vowing to maintain gains in education, Davis proposed
closing most of the divide with roughly $5 billion in budget cuts, $5
billion in long-term borrowing, more than $1 billion in new aid from
the federal government and $142 million in new fees and penalties.</LD>
<LD>   The major question is the wisdom of so much borrowing. One
alternative is to raise taxes. But the Democratic chief executive,
now seeking reelection, vowed not to propose a tax increase, which in
his eyes undoubtedly would be an act of political suicide. That act
of avoidance is surely better in the short term for the governor's
political hide, but it's not better for taxpayers in the long run.</LD>
<TE>   Davis didn't say he would object if someone else--the
Legislature--sends a tax hike to his desk. Lawmakers should try
something reasonable, possibly a temporary income surtax on the
wealthy or a partial rollback in recent auto registration fee cuts.
That would avoid shifting so much of the debt burden to a future
generation in strung-out interest payments.</TE>
<TE>   Loans are costly--more than $4 billion in interest over 20 years
to borrow $2.4 billion against the state's future tobacco settlement
payments, the money that all states receive from the negotiated
settlement of lawsuits against the tobacco companies for the damage
that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco do to the health of
Americans. Some say that's what you do in rough times, borrow,
particularly when interest rates are so low.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans want Davis to cut more spending but are fuzzy in
saying exactly where. In Davis' proposed budget, education already
loses nearly $1 billion and health and human services $1.2 billion.
Those categories account for 80% of general fund spending. Borrowing
may be costly, but it does not violate the state Constitution, as
some say. The document only says the governor must indicate where
he's getting the money needed to balance the budget. Nor is this
budget an exercise in bookkeeping trickery or duplicity, another
criticism. Davis' budget is remarkably candid in detailing where the
money comes from and goes, including interest costs.</TE>
<TE>   Others call the budget a gamble because it is based on a predicted
midyear economic upturn. But all of the state's budgets are gambles
since they forecast trends 18 months into the future. Davis will
revise the budget in May based on new economic data. Even after that,
the budget can be changed at any time to adjust to unexpected
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   One major mistake by Davis was to propose a $234-million savings
by denying a 3.9% state cost-of-living increase to the aged, blind
and disabled and some who are in the welfare-to-work programs.
"Immoral," thundered John Burton, the Senate chief and the godfather
of these annual increases since Ronald Reagan was governor. This
money will be restored by the Legislature. That's one thing you can
take to the bank.</TE>

<CX>   State budget--A Times editorial Jan. 14 incorrectly said it would
cost the state more than $4 billion to borrow $2.4 billion over a 20-year
period. Gov. Gray Davis' budget called the $4-billion figure 'debt
service,' which often is defined as interest on a loan. In this case,
Finance Department officials said it referred to both interest and
principal.</CX>

<LD>Big news for pets with owners: You can get very sick from hanging
around humans.</LD>
<LD>   According to a new scientific study, people carry all kinds of
weird germs on their bodies. You never know where humans have been or
what they've been doing. And since pets don't see owners suddenly
give themselves tongue baths, they must assume that owners are pretty
careless about everyday hygiene. Which clearly turns owners into
potential disease carriers.</LD>
<LD>   The study, presented to a recent meeting of the American Society
for Microbiology, revealed the spread of virulent microbes from the
bodies of healthy humans to pets, seriously infecting the animals,
often months later.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, the human-to-pet infection linkage was difficult
to prove. But Shelley Rankin, a University of Pennsylvania
microbiologist, says veterinarians now see more infection of domestic
animals by owners, often involving serious drug-resistant staph
infections that cause everything from simple pimples to lethal blood
infections. "People think it only goes one way, from animals to
humans," said Rankin, who lives with a fastidious cat named Woody.
"This shows the other side of the story."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, doctors knew of germ transmission from human-to-human
contact; that's why hospitals and restaurants warn workers to wash
their hands frequently. Now they've traced germ transmission through
person-to-pet contact.</TE>
<TE>   Pets have long known they can become severely tired from human
contact--an owner's insatiable need, for instance, to watch cats bat
plastic balls around or people's penchant for throwing useless sticks
across the yard time after time despite a dog's persistent fetching.
And what veteran household animal hasn't put up with wearing a bow or
jingly bell on some special day when tiny pieces of fragrant foods
are available for kitchen mooching? But few pets knew the real
dangers of serious illnesses from close human contact.</TE>
<TE>   Some important health tips for pets: Don't put human hands in your
mouth unless you smell fresh soap. And at all costs avoid the human
face, especially the nose and mouth, prime germ-breeding areas
despite faint mint or flower smells. Never, ever, lick humans there,
no matter how much they beg or talk like babies.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Airport Screener Blame Game," Commentary, Jan. 9: Americans
not only have the right to blame the security screeners at the
airports but they are also right in doing so. The overall majority of
high school dropouts do not have the necessary logic in order to be
able to make their own decisions about what is not listed in the
training handbook. Sure, they can read their training handbook and
memorize it, but an airport security screener must be able to use
reasoning. They cannot rely on the handbook or training manuals to
list every possible event that may occur and what the solution is.</LD>
<LD>   The job of an airport security screener is not the same as a cab
driver; the safety of millions of Americans rely on security
screeners. If the government is going to allow dropouts to safeguard
the lives of Americans, then they might as well be employed as
federal agents, CIA officials and police officers. Dropouts would not
be dropouts in the first place if it weren't for their lack of logic
and reasoning to tell them to at least get a diploma. And yes,
algebra is important. Simply put, if they can't pass it, they can't
use reason.</LD>

<LD>After reading of the desperate plight of the women of Afghanistan and
seeing from photographs how attractive many of them are now that they
are shedding their burkas, I would like to suggest a solution to the
problem (Jan. 8). Let all the emancipated Western democracies issue
emigrant visas to all young, single women under the age of 24 so that
they can leave Afghanistan and start new lives in their host
countries.</LD>
<LD>   Their youth would enable them to adapt to the change of
environment and culture and they would find husbands who would not
treat them like pariah dogs. When Afghanistan is eventually bereft of
the female sex then perhaps this would serve as a catalyst for change
in that society.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "High Court Limits Who Is Disabled," Jan. 9: It is difficult to
believe that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has any understanding of the
word "hardship." For that matter, it's difficult to believe that any
of the nine justices understand anything about hardship. Most of us
ordinary people easily see how someone could have the ability to
brush his or her teeth for a few minutes with one hand and yet not
have the strength to stand on an assembly line for eight hours
holding a five-pound wrench, tightening bolts all day with that same
hand.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps our black-robed, compassionless conservatives might gain
some greater understanding if we could require them all to simply
brush their teeth for eight hours a day, five days a week, for a
month or so. While not as difficult as actually working on an
assembly line, the repetitive motion might help them understand how
one might actually acquire carpal tunnel or repetitive stress
syndrome.</LD>
<LD>   A welcome ancillary benefit for all of us, in dramatic
juxtaposition to those somber black robes, would be to see the nine
justices return from their month of tooth-brushing beaming with
newfound understanding of factory life and human hardship, sitting on
their constitutional thrones displaying the whitest, purest,
most-sympathetic smiles in Washington.</LD>

<LD>I feel elated to find my name quoted on two consecutive dispatches
from Pakistan by David Lamb. However, in the Jan. 10 dispatch,
"Pakistanis See Their Nation Transformed," the last sentence does not
faithfully reflect the spirit of my answers to his question put to
me: Would Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf restore democracy
by October of this year?</LD>
<LD>   I replied that five things are certain: 1) there shall be
elections in October 2002; 2) before elections are held there would
be amendments to the constitution which envision a parliamentary form
of government, to give an effective executive role to the president
in the affairs of the state; 3) a mechanism shall be introduced
through which the armed forces of the country would have
institutional say in the policy formulation for the country--in fact,
before Musharraf took over power in October 1999, there was a sort of
growing consensus in the country that such a role was necessary for
political stability and the health of policies of the country; 4)
Musharraf would certainly be around as president--he has declared
that quite openly; and 5) the political clout of the political
parties is not quite clear at this stage.</LD>

Medicinal Use," Jan. 9: As the nation's oldest sickle cell disease
social service agency, we struggle daily to bring the plight of
people with sickle cell disease to the public's attention. It is this
nation's most serious and prevalent genetic disorder, with over
70,000 people suffering its effects.</LD>
<LD>   We constantly battle with those in the media, entertainment
industry and professional sports who tell us sickle cell disease is
"too small," that their clients can't reap enough of a benefit from
involvement with our foundation and the work we do for the sickle
cell disease clients and their families.</LD>
<LD>   And maybe they are right: There's a whole lot more glamour in a
story with 200 pounds of pot involved than with 100 chronically ill
children at a summer camp that hasn't seen a celebrity visitor in six
years.</LD>

<LD>Re "American Jews Face East-West Power Struggle," Jan. 6: Since I
reopened the American Jewish Congress' California office over 16
months ago, we have expanded our membership, carried out an extensive
program and have become financially stable. I disagree with Daniel
Sokatch that there is a "growing divide between Jews dedicated to a
traditional agenda of Holocaust remembrance, fighting anti-Semitism
and support of Israel and those fired by broader ideals of social
justice." The AJC reflects both agendas.</LD>
<LD>   This week we are launching a lecture series that will explore the
roots of terrorism, Islam and the West and the possibility of peace
in the Middle East. Last year, we held a dinner with the Asian
community about the racial profiling of Wen Ho Lee and co-sponsored
an event with the Assn. of Turkish Americans of Southern California.
A delegation of our leadership went to Mexico City to meet with
members of President Vicente Fox's Cabinet to discuss immigration
reform and investment in Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Our opposition to President Bush's faith-based initiative
manifested itself in our bringing suit against the California
Employment Development Department to stop a $5-million program
designed exclusively for religious organizations. We have the major
brief before the Supreme Court opposing school vouchers for religious
education. The American Jewish Congress is playing a vital role in
defending the civil liberties and constitutional rights of all
Americans.</TE>

<LD>Overpopulation is the root cause of many of the world's problems. It
has affected the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat,
our natural resources and our economic well-being.</LD>
<LD>   I can sympathize with those people from ''deprived areas'' who
wish to immigrate, either legally or illegally, into countries that
offer better opportunities for a better quality of life. At the same
time, it is the duty of these countries to protect the standard of
living of their citizens by not allowing excessive immigration to
diminish it.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the United States appears to exacerbate
overpopulation in our country by making it easier for illegal
immigrants to enter and offering unwarranted incentives, once they
arrive. Overpopulation equals disaster.</LD>

<LD>Norah Vincent's latest incoherent rambling ("Alone in a Crowd--and
Then on a Plane," Commentary, Jan. 10) said that Charles Bishop's
teacher "reportedly advised her students not to be too quick to judge
people because of their skin color or religion."</LD>
<LD>   Vincent then dismissed the teacher's lesson as "mushy, politically
correct pedagogy." Is this the current state of conservative thought
in America? Loving your neighbor is considered mushy political
correctness? Teaching that prejudice and bigotry are wrong is simply
pedagogy? How shameful.</LD>

vast majority are not class warfare but being critical of it is.</LD>
<LD>   Now we have the Enron scandal. The biggest bankruptcy in the
history of our country. A handful of executives (including pals of
our "compassionate conservative" president) made untold hundreds of
millions of dollars by selling their stock, which they knew was
overvalued, and then destroying incriminating documents (Jan. 11).
All this while thousands of men and women working for Enron lost
their life savings after they were prevented by company rules and
company rulers from selling the stock in their pension plans. Oops,
there I go again. Class warfare.</LD>

<TE>   I can hear the hand-slapping among the Democrats regarding the
Enron bankruptcy. Here is their chance to take the emphasis off the
vilification of the Clinton presidency. Before they get too elated,
they should be aware that Enron gave millions of campaign dollars to
both Republicans and Democrats. Many Democrats are enjoying their
place in office from the coffers of Enron. It's going to be
interesting to see who is going to prosecute this company, since
everyone had their hands out at one time or another.</TE>

<TE>   I will be looking for The Times to give the American people a
full, fair and unrelenting reporting of the tangle of associations
between Bush administration members and Enron. I feel that if ever a
special prosecutor was called for, this is the time. I do not think
considerations concerning the war in Afghanistan should deter this
investigation. President Clinton proved that it is possible to
continue doing the business of the country even though the
Republicans carried on a full-time, full-term investigation of
everything they could think of.</TE>

what we preach--justice for all!</TE>

<TE>   Reading your articles about the debacle of the Enron meltdown, in
which only those at the top were allowed to cash out their
investments, and the lush profits reaped by the Carlyle Group, an
investment company with good connections and employees from former
Republican administrations (Jan. 10), I thought about Joseph E.
Stiglitz. Stiglitz recently was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics.
His thesis is that economic transactions are not guided by pure
market forces because all parties to the transaction do not have
equal knowledge. He calls this "asymmetrical knowledge." He states
that regulations are needed to provide a more level playing field.</TE>
<TE>   The guiding hand of markets is invisible because it does not
exist. A simple and obvious concept that is making news daily.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California astronomers have made the first discovery of a planet
orbiting a giant star that had burned out and swollen to a massive
size. Astronomers did not expect that any planet would survive the
expansion of the star it orbits.</LD>
<LD>   The finding was announced at last week's annual meeting of the
American Astronomical Society. The findings arise from techniques
that measure how much gravitational pull an object exerts on the star
it is orbiting. The results suggest that the object is a planet eight
times the size of Jupiter, although it could be a failed brown dwarf
star instead.</LD>
<LD>   If it is a planet, it is not believed to contain any life. Giant
stars pummel their nearby environment with radiation and heat.</LD>

<LD>A group of astronomers has struck gold--in the nether regions of the
Milky Way. The team reported at the American Astronomical Society
meeting that it detected gold, silver and platinum in an ancient star
in the halo surrounding our galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   It is the first time that gold has been detected in a star other
than our sun. Although difficult to detect, gold and platinum are
thought to be present in all stars. The elements are not produced by
the star but by massive supernova explosions. The findings could
explain how the elements that make up our world and bodies came into
being.</LD>
<LD>   If it could be mined, the amount of gold in the star would be
worth an estimated $7 billion trillion, estimated astronomer Tim
Beers of Michigan State University, who worked with University of
Oklahoma astronomer John Cowan to detect the metals.</LD>

<LD>Cannibal Count Ugolino, imprisoned in Pisa's Clock Tower in the 13th
century, was not slowly starved and driven to eat the flesh of his
own dead sons, as Dante Alighieri wrote in his famous "Inferno," but
was killed by a blow to the head after five months in prison,
according to an Italian archeologist. Francesco Mallegni of the
University of Pisa has found five skeletons buried in a crypt under a
church in Pisa, along with a scroll saying they are the bones of the
Ugolino clan.</LD>
<LD>   All five men suffered from malnutrition during the last months of
their lives, indicating they were poorly fed in prison, but they were
killed long before they could starve to death. The count could not
have eaten his sons, Mallegni said, because he had no teeth.</LD>

<LD>It comes from canola seeds, according to the Canola Council of

<HD>Wild About Lichens</HD>
<DH>An illustrated coffee table book may elevate the status of
the 'lowly' life form often mistaken for moss, but whose species are
prolific chemical factories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES SCIENCE WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are chartreuse and vivid orange, velvety black and speckled red.
They are shaped like ruffles, flowers, golf tees, tiny volcanoes, and
even letters. And most people never notice them. Those who do tend to
get obsessed.</LD>
<LD>   Lichens, considered by their fans to be "the essence of wildness,"
thrive only in clean air and pristine environments. Far from cities,
they color the wilderness, growing on rocks, trees and soil.</LD>
<LD>   Most people, if they think about them at all, think lichens are a
stain, or a texture or "simply a moss," sniffed Irwin Brodo, a
lichenologist at Ottawa's Canadian Museum of Nature.</LD>
<TE>   One sure way to aggravate a lichenologist is to call a lichen a
plant. They are not plants. They are a strange and sometimes
aggressive collaboration between a fungus, which cannot make its own
food, and an alga or bacterium, which can. Biologists call the alga
or bacterium portion of the combination a "photobiont," meaning it
uses energy from light to create food that it shares with the fungal
portion of the lichen. The fungus, in turn, stores water and in other
ways protects the photobiont from the often-harsh environments in
which lichens exist.</TE>
<TE>   If separated in a lab, the algae and cyanobacteria go back to
their normal colonies; the fungi produce "a characterless heap," said
Brodo. But together, the components grow into complicated, sculptural
structures.</TE>
<TE>   They have many mysteries. For hundreds of years, botanists,
stumped as to how lichens reproduce, called them "cryptogams,"
meaning hidden sex. (Lichens put out packets with both algal and
fungal cells to get new lichens started.) Chief among remaining
mysteries, said Brodo, is why they are so little noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "They have an undeserved reputation as being at the low end of the
totem pole," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lichen experts argue that paying more attention to lichens could
pay off. Much of the Los Angeles Basin, for example, is now barren of
lichens. This is because lichens, which take in water from the air
instead of through roots, are highly sensitive to air pollution. In
many places, Brodo said, lichens are used as air pollution monitors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lichens Secrete 600 Byproducts</TE>
<TE>   Lichens are also chemical factories, secreting 600 byproducts.
They have been used as dyes for Navajo blankets and, mixed with
urine, dyes for the royal purple robes of England. They contain
poisons and antibiotics. Lichens have been used in medicinal salves
and teas around the world. Japanese scientists view them as potential
cancer-fighting agents.</TE>
<TE>   These chemicals are probably produced as a defense against
predation. Lichens are extremely tasty to animals; they make up 90%
of the winter diet of caribou and line the nests of flying squirrels.
"Because the squirrels also eat these lichens, they can munch on
their homes whenever they are hungry," Brodo notes.</TE>
<TE>   People don't generally eat lichens because they are difficult to
digest. But the Inuit do enjoy partially digested lichens taken from
the rumen of recently killed caribou. Lichens known as "rock tripe"
may have kept members of an ill-fated 1819 Arctic expedition alive.
Some scholars believe "manna from heaven" was actually a kind of
lichen that once drifted across Middle Eastern deserts and became wet
and edible with the morning dew.</TE>
<TE>   Lichens also play a crucial environmental role. They colonize bare
rock and then secrete acids to eat at the rock, laying the groundwork
for plants that will come later. They also increase the fertility of
soil.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not just pretty faces," said Brent Mishler, who heads the
Jepson Herbarium at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Poets and writers who cherish quiet places, like Henry David
Thoreau, have often waxed eloquently about the existence of lichens
on trees and gravestones. But it is the beauty of lichens,
particularly seen up close, that has inspired the latest homage to
the tiny life forms. Brodo, along with nature photographers and
self-taught Berkeley lichen experts Sylvia and Stephen Sharnoff, have
distilled their admiration of the "lowly lichen" into an unlikely
product: a lavish, richly illustrated coffee table book on the
lichens of North America.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Possibly the Audubons to the Lichen Family</TE>
<TE>   Reviewers say the book could do for lichens what John James
Audubon did for birds and E.O. Wilson did for ants: make them visible
to countless Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute people look at them under the magnifying glass, they
are blown away," Mishler said. "It's like a little world."</TE>
<TE>   The book was the brainchild of the late Sylvia Sharnoff, the
daughter of Victor Durant, a science photographer at UC Berkeley.
Sharnoff continued her father's legacy after his death, photographing
lichens that would be at home in any Dr. Suess book as she backpacked
through California.</TE>
<TE>   Because lichens are so small and cameras must be placed so close
for shots, many photographers had been unable to capture their color
and detail. Sharnoff combated that by using an invention of her
dad's: a camera mounted with two braced flashes that poured light
onto the lichens</TE>
<TE>   Originally, Sylvia Sharnoff thought she might spend three weeks
reading about lichens and put together a "modest book," Stephen
Sharnoff said. "She started because they were so interesting and
strange to look at. It just grew."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Sharnoff soon "got hooked" and gave up his construction
job to help. The pair poured their savings into a small RV and
crisscrossed the country, eventually photographing 1,300 species of
lichens. They went to hot spots like the Channel Islands, where
lichens thrive in fog, and Appalachia, aging mountains with lichens
that grow nowhere else. They found a soul mate in Brodo--and were
welcomed into the botanical fold.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a long tradition of amateurs being accepted by PhDs in
botany," Stephen Sharnoff said.</TE>
<TE>   They were not so welcomed, however, on publishers' row.</TE>
<TE>   "Publishers," said Brodo, "thought we were obsessed by something
esoteric that wasn't very important."</TE>
<TE>   It was not an uncommon response. "If you just mention the word
'lichens' to people, they just shrug and get a vague, faraway look on
their face," Sharnoff said. "If you show them color pictures, though,
they get interested."</TE>
<TE>   Editors at Yale University Press, however, loved the idea. They
supported the project--all 795 thick, glossy pages of it. The gamble
seems to be paying off. Released late last year, the $70 book has
sold half of a 7,500-copy press run, Sharnoff said. For a time, he
added, "Lichens of North America" was the 30th-most popular book sold
by Amazon.com.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Sharnoff didn't live to see the finished project. She died
of cancer in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "It means so much to me," Stephen Sharnoff said, "that Sylvia's
vision of getting the world excited about lichens is actually coming
true."</TE>

<HD>Argentine Crisis Won't End Until Corruption Does</HD>

<AU>JONATHAN M. MILLER</AU>
<BD>Jonathan M. Miller, a law professor at Southwestern
University School of Law, has published two books in Argentina on
Argentine constitutional law.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Argentina's economy is collapsing and the U.S. needs to help save it
if it has any interest in hemispheric stability. But first we need to
make the right diagnosis.</LD>
<LD>   At the heart of the Argentine crisis is a political system that
avoids accountability, and only political reform can stop the
spiraling decay.</LD>
<LD>   Members of Congress are elected by party slate and owe their
political future not to satisfying voters but to the head of their
political faction. They keep their posts because they vote as they
are told and in turn demand spoils to distribute to their own
clients. Provincial governors, while directly elected, depend on the
federal government for most of their revenue. They "succeed" to the
extent that crises in their provinces allow them to insist on a
bigger cut of central government funds, which they distribute to
supporters.</LD>
<TE>   Union leaders control billions of dollars in health and social
service contributions and perpetuate their power through unsupervised
elections, intimidation and under-the-table deals with employers.</TE>
<TE>   The judiciary, fairly respected through the 1980s, has been
selectively packed to avoid challenges to the corrupt status quo.
Even judges who have been filmed in acts of extortion remain on the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   The International Monetary Fund has tacitly accepted this
political morass. Many privatizations of the 1990s, central to the
IMF's program, contained sweetheart clauses that no political system
with minimal accountability could permit. Domingo Cavallo, the
now-infamous ex-finance minister, planned to save the country's
finances and satisfy the IMF with a "zero deficit" package. But his
proposed 2002 budget venally increased the funds for the operation of
Congress from $417 million to $431 million while cutting health
spending from $622 million to $501 million.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Argentina needs at least $20 billion in new financing to
achieve stability. The common belief among its politicians is that if
they present the U.S. government and the IMF with a credible economic
plan, they will get it. But if the U.S. and the IMF only insist on
economic reforms, they will only perpetuate the systemic corruption
that keeps making their intervention necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's politicians have shielded themselves from
accountability, but there are specific institutional changes that
could produce it. For example, having legislators elected by
individual district instead of by party slate and having them
nominated through open primaries could create a body of
representatives that must answer to the public. Although U.S. threats
to withhold support absent political change may seem paternalistic,
the purely economic adjustments typically required by the IMF for
funds are equally if not more invasive.</TE>
<TE>   Many countries require local governments to depend on local
taxation instead of continuous negotiations over their "cut" from the
central government. Requiring such a reform, to create both fiscal
responsibility and truly independent local authority, is hardly more
intrusive than the massive privatizations of public enterprises
required by the IMF in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Creation of a labor system with outside monitoring of union
elections, competition between unions instead of single industrywide
unions, and the separation of unions from the management of worker
health programs can create a labor system in which workers' interests
are honestly represented. The new government of Eduardo Duhalde is
now rolling back the few reforms achieved in recent years, but U.S.
and IMF threats to withhold funding can push reforms back on track.</TE>
<TE>   Only political reform can transform Argentina from a kleptocracy
to a responsive democracy and end the cycle of politically created
deficits. Two weeks ago, thousands banged pots in the capital to
force the ouster of Carlos Grosso as chief Cabinet advisor. His
remark that the country should "stop crying and dance samba" like
Brazil was too galling even for Buenos Aires' cynical citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and the IMF can hardly put together a rescue package that
disregards the clamor. Admittedly institution-building has never been
part of the IMF's mandate, but just by lending money the IMF is
intervening. This time its intervention must also seek to end the
corrupt status quo.</TE>

<AU>LOIS SALISBURY and THEODORE R. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>Lois Salisbury is president of Children Now. Theodore
R. Mitchell is president of Occidental College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The political landscape taking shape for this year's gubernatorial
election should be full of promise for California's nearly 10 million
children.</LD>
<LD>   Both Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, the front-runner among the Republican candidates,
have named education and children as their priority. Indeed, in his
State of the State speech Tuesday, Davis vowed that education would
be protected "above all else" in the state budget. Yet many of
California's working families struggle with the economic downturn in
an already very expensive state to raise children.</LD>
<LD>   The gubernatorial candidates face hard questions when it comes to
translating their statements into action. How do they fulfill their
pledges in a time of growing budget deficits? On what criteria do
Davis and Riordan base their proposals about what gets cut or
delayed?</LD>
<TE>   In the recent report "California Report Card 2001: Factors for
School Success," the Oakland-based research and action group Children
Now identified key state policies that affect a child's ability to
succeed in school. Health coverage, for example, helps kids arrive at
school able to learn, unimpaired by hearing problems, untreated
asthma or the consequences of low birth weight. A good preschool
experience improves a child's readiness for kindergarten and
diminishes the likelihood of having to repeat a grade or being placed
in special education. Credentialed teachers and small classes
particularly help disadvantaged children.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the report concludes that the state budget must:</TE>
<TE>   * Increase access to high-quality preschool and child care.</TE>
<TE>   * Improve and streamline access to health coverage, while at the
same time maximizing federal funds to match state expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   * Target school improvement money on the low-performing schools
where disadvantaged children are concentrated.</TE>
<TE>   * Expand the supply of good after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   * Maximize access to federally subsidized food programs for
California's low-income families, two-thirds of which are working but
cannot pay for all their needs. This includes programs that help
nourish infants and toddlers during the critical early years.</TE>
<TE>   Expensive? Not necessarily. There are 2-to-1 federal matching
dollars available for the health coverage that Davis wants to delay
until 2003. The food programs come mostly from federal money, waiting
to be tapped. While preschool expansion will cost the state,
California only enrolls 28% of its eligible children in the federally
funded Head Start.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, in the context of state budget deficits, hard choices will
have to be made. But maximizing school success is about the future
work force and economic strength of California. And, in poll after
poll, Californians say that education is their top priority for this
state.</TE>
<TE>   A special legislative session is convening to address the growing
budget deficit. With a March gubernatorial primary looming, we need
to know how Riordan would apply his "children first" agenda to budget
decisions. So far, the debate assumes that the hard decisions are
about what to cut. But there are growing calls in the Legislature not
to rule out increasing taxes, especially given the average $16,000
windfall that, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, wealthy
taxpayers will receive in 2002 from last year's federal tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson faced a similar
budget crunch, he opted for a temporary 1% to 2% increase in the
upper bracket of state income taxes. Which of today's candidates can
provide us with comparable leadership?</TE>

<HD>Don't Destroy the Wild Places for Oil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES E. SERVICE</AU>
<BD>Vice Admiral James E. Service, U.S. Navy (ret.), has
served as commander of the U.S. Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet
and president of the Naval War College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was flying combat missions over the devastated landscapes of
Korea and Vietnam in the 1950s and '60s, I took comfort from the
thought that the pristine mountains and forests of my own country
awaited my return.</LD>
<LD>   The country I fought for and served was more than just a
government, or even a people. In my mind, the idea of the United
States of America is inextricably linked with the natural beauty and
grandeur of our homeland.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, citing the wartime urgency of reducing our
imports of foreign oil, oil companies and their friends have been
calling on Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to
oil drilling.</LD>
<TE>   Opening the last 5% of Alaska's North Slope would do virtually
nothing to increase our national security, while inflicting an
incalculable injury on one of our last remaining wild places.</TE>
<TE>   The refuge is a uniquely American place of free-flowing rivers,
primeval herds of musk oxen, flocks of waterfowl and unclimbed
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The native Gwich'in people call it "The Place Where Life Begins";
the caribou on which they depend gather to give birth there every
spring.</TE>
<TE>   Oil companies claim to have made drilling more environmentally
friendly, but such claims are relative. You simply can't drill oil
without spilling oil.</TE>
<TE>   The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation records close
to 400 spills each year. This amounts to 1.3 million gallons of oil
and other toxic substances over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   One need only look at the sprawling industrial complex that has
cropped up around Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil fields, which are a few
hundred miles to the west, to understand that oil exploration would
irrevocably change the face of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States is really serious about weaning itself from
foreign oil, the smartest, quickest and most economical solution is
to use less of it.</TE>
<TE>   That means getting more out of each barrel. If we took advantage
of existing and emerging technology to produce cars that travel
farther on a gallon of gas, we could dramatically reduce demand and
pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, the American consumer would save money at the
pump. In fact, if our passenger vehicles went just three more miles
on a gallon of gas, we would save a million barrels of oil a day.
That is almost twice as much as we're importing from Iraq and five
times what we might get from the Arctic refuge, according to the
Wilderness Society.</TE>
<TE>   We have the technology to make our society more efficient. We have
only lacked the political will to make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   As long as we continue our current rates of consumption, a truly
safe long-term supply doesn't exist. Our reserves (in Alaska and
elsewhere) constitute only 3% of the world's known supply, but we
continue to account for 25% of global oil demand.</TE>
<TE>   Some drilling proponents claim the refuge could dramatically
reduce our oil imports. But according to the U.S. Geological Survey,
the most likely amount of economically recoverable oil under the
refuge is 3.2 billion barrels--less than what the United States
consumes in six months.</TE>
<TE>   The USGS estimates that the amount of oil likely to be recovered
from the Arctic refuge would be no more than 0.3% of the world's oil
reserves, and at no time would oil from the refuge satisfy more than
1% or 2% of total American demand. On top of that, it would take a
decade or more to get the oil flowing.</TE>
<TE>   Returning from war, my thoughts of home were first of my family,
and then turned to the rivers, forests and deserts that define my
sense of the American landscape. Never did I feel I had to fear that
those beautiful landscapes would not be there for me on my
homecoming.</TE>
<TE>   Today, I wonder if our fighting men and women around the world can
be so sure that their American wilderness is safe while they are
away.</TE>
<TE>   National security means more than protecting our people, our
cities and our sovereignty. It also means protecting the wild places
that make our nation special.</TE>
<TE>   Drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge when we have better,
cheaper, faster and more responsible solutions to our energy dilemma
just doesn't make good sense or good policy.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a professor of law at George
Washington University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1014, Byzantine Emperor Basil II had a bit of a problem. He had
decisively defeated the Bulgarian tsar and taken virtually the entire
opposing army captive. Basil II was not keen on feeding and holding
more than 14,000 prisoners of war, but he also was not inclined to
release an entire army that could simply turn around and resume
hostilities. His solution was both chilling and simple: He divided
the army into groups of 100 and blinded 99 out of each group. He left
one man with one eye in each group to lead this line of wretches back
to the Bulgarian tsar.</LD>
<LD>   Basil II's dilemma came to mind last week as the first U.S.
prisoners from Afghanistan arrived, hooded and shackled, at Camp
X-Ray, the new prison under construction at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The
U.S. is now coming to grips with one of the oldest problems for a
victorious army: what to do with the defeated army.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, most prisoners from the war have been released in
Afghanistan. However, thousands remain in custody. The U.S. is
convinced that, if released, many of these prisoners would
immediately look for the nearest Al Qaeda recruiter. One of the least
discussed reasons for continuing the bombing campaign over the
objections of local warlords was simple mathematics: more daisy
cutters, fewer detainees.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, unlike Basil II, the U.S. is restrained in its options
by principles of decency and morality. President Bush may have a
reputation for Texas-style justice but he is not likely to call for
the red-hot pokers and send back a single-file line of sightless
prisoners led by their one-eyed mullah. Moreover, he is unlikely to
allow the conviction and summary execution of thousands of prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no politician wants to release an Al Qaeda version of Willie
Horton, some parolee of Camp X-Ray who ends up on the evening news
holding a release order and a vial of anthrax. This means that a
large number of prisoners will need to be held for an extended
period. However, while the occupants of a "prison" are normally
called "prisoners," the administration has been careful not to use
the P word.</TE>
<TE>   Despite international objections, the U.S. has refused to
establish the status of these prisoners. The most obvious status is
that of prisoners of war, given the administration's insistence that
this is a "war" even without a formal declaration of war from
Congress. The administration, however, is reluctant to declare the
prisoners to be POWs, which would trigger international rules,
including the Geneva Convention. Most significant, the U.S. would
have to release POWs at the end of the conflict, except for those men
accused of war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The argument used to deny these prisoners the formal status of
POWs is as compelling as an "Osama unplugged" diatribe. According to
the rules of war, a captive is not a prisoner of war unless he meets
certain criteria, including wearing a uniform and insignia. Various
experts have argued that the Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners were not
wearing uniforms and therefore are not entitled to be considered
POWs. Obviously, many of the international rules have been written by
Western military powers, who would not be caught dead in a war
without all of the trappings of rank.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many wars are fought by armies that are both impoverished and
improvised. Many of our allies in the Northern Alliance were dressed
the same as these prisoners and included many Taliban fighters who
simply switched sides without changing into something more
presentable. Other under-dressed warriors in Afghanistan include
American operatives. We would not tolerate arguments that our
fighters and allies were not soldiers entitled to international
protections if taken prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the administration has chosen to call its prisoners
"detainees" and created a special military tribunal to try and punish
them outside of our legal system.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, these prisoners must be held until their identities and
possible war crimes are established. Yet, most of them are obviously
not leaders but rank-and-file soldiers. They are fanatics but they
were captured in classic combatant roles.</TE>
<TE>   We will need to resolve not just their status but our right to
hold them in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current policy, Bush will not only have unilateral
control over the rules governing his military tribunals but he will
now operate an entire prison system of his own making. He will have
his own prison, created and operated without congressional
authorization. Prisoners will be sentenced to some range of time that
he finds appropriate and held under conditions that he finds
sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   For Basil II, "justice is blind" had a very peculiar meaning. The
prisoners in Cuba face a more humane future but we, as citizens, have
a right to dictate the conditions for any punishment that is carried
out in our name. We have failed if Camp X-Ray merely proves that when
it comes to inconvenient prisoners, "out of sight is out of mind."</TE>

<LD>You may have heard the wisdom that one shouldn't cover cuts and
scrapes with Band-Aids and gauze and the like but keep them exposed
to the air so they can "breathe" and heal faster. I dutifully
followed these instructions not long back after cutting my
foot--which led to a pathetic, monthlong merry-go-round of the cut
nearly healing then re-cracking, nearly healing then re-cracking,
over and over again.</LD>
<LD>   And now I learn that I gained nothing from all the pain, whining
and (I'll admit) a certain amount of exaggerated limping to solicit
sympathy. Exposing my cut to the cruel and desiccating air slowed the
healing of my heel.</LD>
<LD>   Wounds--even if they're not in a crack-prone location--heal faster
when they're moist. They heal less painfully when moist. And they're
less likely to form a visible scar.</LD>
<TE>   The reason for this is not exactly rocket science, says
wound-healing expert Dr. Warren Garner, whom we called to consult on
the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Wounds, after all, are healed through the action of certain cells
in our body--which cleverly realize there's a breach in that body's
hull and spring into action to plug it and repair it.</TE>
<TE>   "Cells like to live in a wet environment, so they work better in a
wet environment," says Garner, an associate professor of plastic
surgery at USC's Keck School of Medicine. This moist-healing rule
applies to your everyday, unserious wounds such as the one on my foot
and the periodic scrapes that Garner's kids sustain (which are
quickly plied with antibiotic cream, then a Band-Aid). It also
applies to the serious, long-lingering ones that Garner and other
wound experts treat.</TE>
<TE>   These days, most in the medical community know that wounds should
heal moist. But it wasn't always so. From ancient Greece far into the
20th century, dryness was deemed best. Then--starting with
experiments in the '60s--scientists put this premise to the test.
Using pigs and then humans, they measured how fast wounds healed when
uncovered or kept moist and at last discovered the truth. Still, UCLA
nurse practitioner Deborah Caswell (who specializes in wound
treatment) recalls old-fashioned days of treating wounds with
sunlamps to get them nice and dry. And more than just sunlamps.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to put Mylanta on chronic wounds. We used to coat them
with sugar," she reminisces. There's a rationale for some of this:
Sugar, for instance, can impede the growth of bacteria (though
neither Garner nor Caswell recommends trying it). She's not quite
sure why the Mylanta was used. "Not everything we do--contrary to
popular belief--is based on good science," Caswell says. "A lot is
based on what we've always done."</TE>
<TE>   Our curiosity piqued, we asked Garner for a step-by-step primer on
wound healing. How's it done? Garner, who has recently been writing
whole chapters on just this subject, obligingly gave us a
very-much-briefer synopsis.</TE>
<TE>   * First comes the all-important step--the plugging of holes in
broken blood vessels, courtesy of the platelets and a blood protein
called fibrin, so we don't bleed to death. (That's where the scab
comes from.) This happens within minutes.</TE>
<TE>   * Next--within hours--immune cells move in to kill any bacteria
that might have gotten into the wound. The first arrivals are pretty
single-minded: They simply concentrate on wiping out bacteria. But
ones arriving later are much fancier and not only kill germs but
start oozing chemicals into the surrounding tissue.</TE>
<TE>   * When skin cells nearby sense those chemicals, they heed the cry
for help and start slithering their way to the site of the wound.
They begin dividing to fill up the gap. And tiny blood vessels start

<HD>Low-Salt, Low-Meat Diet Shows Promise Against Kidney Stones</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES MEDICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A diet low in salt and meat may be the best way to reduce the risk of
having kidney stones, Italian researchers have found in a study that
upsets the conventional wisdom that a low-calcium diet is the best
preventive measure.</LD>
<LD>   The Italian study found that the low-salt, low-meat diet reduced
the risk of subsequent kidney stones by half in men who had had
stones previously. The new diet recommendation will likely become the
"gold standard" for people at risk, said William Keane, president of
the National Kidney Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors for years have told patients to reduce their calcium
intake because most kidney stones are made of a calcium compound.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Loris Borghi and his colleagues at the University of Parma
studied 120 men who had already had at least one kidney stone. Half
were randomly assigned to the low-calcium diet and half to a diet
that limited salt intake to 2,900 milligrams per day and meat intake
to three-quarters of an ounce per day, plus an ounce of cheese or
dairy products. Only men were studied because of the risk that the
low-calcium diet would accelerate osteoporosis in women.</TE>
<TE>   Men account for about 80% of all kidney stones, a highly painful
condition that will affect about 10% of Americans at some time during
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The team reported in the Jan. 10 New England Journal of Medicine
that 23 men on the low-calcium diet experienced another kidney stone
during the five-year study, compared to only 12 of those on the
low-salt, low-protein diet. They conceded, however, that it would be
difficult to get Americans to eat such low quantities of meat.</TE>
<TE>   Serotonin-Enhancing Drugs Shouldn't Be Mixed</TE>
<TE>   The inadvertent use of drug combinations that increase levels of
the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain can lead to strokes due
to narrowing of blood vessels in the brain, according to Boston
researchers. Dr. A.B. Singhal and his colleagues at Massachusetts
General Hospital report in the Jan. 8 Neurology on three patients who
came to their emergency room with Call-Fleming syndrome, which is
characterized by sudden-onset, severe (thunderclap) headaches,
neurological problems and seizures.</TE>
<TE>   The two women and a man were all taking several different
serotonin-enhancing drugs at the same time, including medications for
migraine, depression and colds. Among the drugs that should not be
used in combination are antidepressants, anti-migraine agents,
decongestants, diet pills, amphetamines, St. John's wort, ecstasy,
cocaine and methamphetamine, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Study Yields Clue to Nursing Home Illness</TE>
<TE>   Nursing home residents often develop gastrointestinal illnesses
marked by severe diarrhea in winter, but researchers have never been
sure of the precise cause of these outbreaks. A new study indicates
that the most common cause may be a family of viruses called
Norwalk-like viruses. The viruses may be much more common in nursing
homes than previously recognized, according to researchers from the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Kim Green and colleagues studied specimens obtained from 156
residents of a Maryland nursing home who became ill during the winter
of 1987-88. Researchers at the time had looked for bacteria in the
specimens, but found few, and the samples were frozen for storage.
Using newly developed DNA techniques, the team reported in the Jan.
15 Journal of Infectious Diseases that 80% of the samples contained
Norwalk-like viruses.</TE>
<TE>   The Norwalk virus was first identified in 1972 in a stool sample
obtained in Norwalk, Ohio. Researchers have since found a number of
similar viruses that are called Norwalk-like viruses. They are
responsible for many cases of gastrointestinal distress. The viruses
are hard to study because they do not grow in laboratory animals or
tissue cultures--only in humans. Researchers at NIAID are attempting
to develop a vaccine against the virus.</TE>
<TE>   HIV Linked to Risk of Cancer in Women</TE>
<TE>   Women who are HIV-positive have a significantly increased risk of
developing genital cancer, according to researchers from Columbia
University. As many as 155,000 women in the United States are thought
to be infected with the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Tom Wright and his colleagues studied 925 women who had a
gynecological examination twice yearly, with a follow-up exam three
years later. At the initial exam, the team reported in the Jan. 12
Lancet, they found that HIV-positive women were six times more likely
to have genital warts--a potential precursor of cancer--or very early
stages of cancer than women who were HIV-negative. At the follow-up
exam, the HIV-positive women were 16 times more likely to show the
conditions. The team recommended that HIV-positive women be monitored
closely by their gynecologists.</TE>
<TE>   PET Scan Helps SpotEarly-Stage Alzheimer's</TE>
<TE>   UCLA researchers have found a new way to identify Alzheimer's
disease at its earliest stages, a finding that could help researchers
monitor treatments. The team had previously shown that positron
emission tomography (PET) scanning can identify the disease in most
patients. They now report in the January American Journal of
Geriatric Psychiatry that they have found a way to increase accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   The key is a radioactive molecule called FDDNP. The molecule binds
specifically to the plaques and tangles characteristic of
Alzheimer's, allowing researchers to visualize the markers
accurately. An autopsy on one patient who died showed that FDDNP
binds only to the plaques and tangles in the brain. The team is now
applying to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to use
the technique to check people who are at high risk of developing the
disorder. The main drawback to the diagnostic test is the cost of PET
scans, about $1,500, which is not normally covered by private
insurance or Medicare for Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   Transplant Waiting List Numbers in Thousands</TE>
<TE>   The number of people needing organ transplants in the year that
ended on June 30 was three times as high as the number who actually
got them, according to new data from the Scientific Registry of Organ
Transplants, which monitors such activity. While 23,360 people
received transplants during that period, nearly 80,000 people
remained on the registry waiting list as of June 30. More than 6,000
patients on the waiting list died before receiving transplants.</TE>

<HD>Ways to Lower Fat, Not Flavor</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SHELDON MARGEN and DALE A. OGAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a school of thought that says some things should just be left
alone. For example, why try to make a low-fat cheesecake? The end
result doesn't taste like cheesecake, isn't really cheesecake and
shouldn't even be called cheesecake.</LD>
<LD>   The same holds true of peanut-butter cookies. You really can't
make them without peanut butter. They'll always be high in fat, even
if it's a nice, monounsaturated fat.</LD>
<LD>   But reworking a recipe doesn't have to mean that you end up with a
strange-tasting substance on your plate. Here are some substitutions
that will help you cut down on the fat content of your meals.</LD>
<TE>   Evaporated skim milk: Use this, instead of heavy cream, in all
kinds of recipes. Evaporated milk is good in desserts, creamy sauces
or soups. It tastes like cream and has a richer texture than regular
skim milk. For every cup used in place of a cup of cream, you'll save
80 grams of fat and 600 calories.</TE>
<TE>   Fat-free plain yogurt: Substitute for whole sour cream.
(Unfortunately, fat-free sour cream doesn't have the rich body or
flavor of plain yogurt.) You'll also get more calcium than you would
with sour cream.</TE>
<TE>   Marshmallow creme: Instead of margarine or butter in recipes that
call for fluffy frosting, try this. It adds creaminess and no fat,
but (of course) a lot of sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Applesauce: Use applesauce instead of oil, margarine or butter in
many baked products. For each half-cup substitution, you'll save more
than 900 calories and 100 grams of fat. In recipes where oil is the
only liquid, try half applesauce and half buttermilk. This takes a
little experimentation. Figure it out before you invite company over.</TE>
<TE>   Prunes: Pureed prunes or baby-food prunes work as oil and fat
replacers in chocolate baked goods. The dark color and rich flavor of
the chocolate disguise the prunes, so you probably won't even know
they're there. For each half-cup of prune puree, you'll save nearly
800 calories and more than 100 grams of fat.</TE>
<TE>   Egg whites: Use two egg whites to substitute for each whole egg.
You'll save only 5 grams of fat (because eggs are fairly low in fat),
but you will save 213 milligrams of cholesterol for each egg yolk
that you don't use.</TE>

<HD>Playing to Our Vanity</HD>
<DH>Ab gizmos, body wraps and other products promise fixes
quicker than diet and exercise. A look behind the claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey, Jane E. Allen, Linda Marsa and Shari Roan.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The perfect body may not come in a bottle, but that doesn't stop many
people from wondering: Could it come in a capsule? From a full body
wrap? Perhaps one of those new abdominal stimulators would make a
difference.</LD>
<LD>   To wonder is not to be entirely naive. The alternative, after all,
is to accept a future in which the only answer for an out-of-shape
body is a long, grim dose of leafy greens--and exercise. Or worse. "I
sure don't know of any way to lose 100 pounds in five weeks, and keep
it off," said Judith Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal
medicine at UC Davis. "Except maybe amputation."</LD>
<TE>   And so despite strong native skepticism, many consumers reserve a
wisp of hope, and thereon hangs a $5-billion to $10-billion industry
of body-shaping products, from supplements to new spa treatments. In
recent years these products' claims--melt away pounds as you sleep;
increase breast size; lose weight without changing your diet--have
become bolder, and more frequent, say those who watch the industry.
"There's been a dramatic increase in the amount of advertising and
the number of products out there" in the last 10 years, said Rich
Cleland, a senior attorney in the advertising division of the Federal
Trade Commission, which enforces consumer protection laws prohibiting
deceptive practices. Cleland attributes much of this increase to the
explosive growth through the 1990s of the dietary supplement
industry, which includes such things as herbs, vitamins and diet and
nutrition products.  Especially on the Internet, pitches for weight
loss and body shaping products have adopted a scientific tone. In
addition to the standard before-and-after pictures, testimonials and
endorsements from unfamiliar doctors, many ads now include references
to clinical studies, body mass indexes, bio-availability of nutrients
and so on. "They have picked up all the same medical jargon you would
get from a reputable medical source" such as the Mayo Clinic or the
National Institutes of Health, said Stern.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits companies from making false marketing claims
about the health benefits of products. Companies can say a product
"promotes" weight loss, for instance, but cannot claim that it
prevents or cures a specific health condition. Companies are also not
supposed to make health claims that are not substantiated by
research, under penalty of settlements that can run into the millions
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Such products proliferate nonetheless, because regulators concede
that they lack the staffing or resources to police all of them.
Carefully worded ads--making generous use of words such as "suggest,"
"may" and "could"--can sometimes mislead without actually violating
the law, some industry critics contend.</TE>
<TE>   Several popular products illustrate the appeal of products that
promise a easier way to make our bodies beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Breast Enhancement</TE>
<TE>   Can pills containing a special blend of natural herbs enhance a
woman's cleavage, making breasts firmer and more attractive, without
the need for surgical implants or a breast lift? A host of ads and
infomercials beckon with claims that such products can transform a
woman's breasts, enabling the user to "gain back the firmness you had
as a teenager."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and herbal medicine experts say that a few of the
ingredients could have some visible effect on the breast, although
they don't know if that's a result of swelling or new cell growth.
Unlike prescription drugs, which must undergo a lengthy approval
process before being allowed on the market, the FDA does not require
makers of dietary supplements to demonstrate that their products are
safe or effective. Doctors also express concern that the herbal
ingredients contained in some products have not been studied to
determine if any adverse health effects might result.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the products being promoted for "natural" breast
enhancement are sold under the names Breast Assure and Bloussant. The
products have several herbs in common, including saw palmetto (a
traditional folk treatment said to make breasts larger), dong quai
(an herb long used in China for gynecological ailments), damiana
leaves (used as an aphrodisiac), dandelion, blessed thistle and wild
yam.</TE>
<TE>   Bloussant also contains fennel seed, used as a folk remedy to
increase breast milk in nursing women and to increase libido;
watercress, a leaf with antibiotic and diuretic actions; and black
cohosh, often taken to relieve the hot flashes of menopause.</TE>
<TE>   Breast Assure also has fenugreek, an herb used in folk medicine to
encourage breast milk production.</TE>
<TE>   According to Home Health, the Bohemia, N.Y.-based maker of Breast
Assure, the product contains vitamin C and collagen "to support the
underlying structure of the breast," and chaste tree fruit, which
"has been shown to help with breast tenderness," said Ona Scandurra,
director of nutrition communications for Home Health. Asked for
specific effects on the breast, she said: "It helps nourish them. It
provides ingredients for the cells and tissues."</TE>
<TE>   The company does not claim that Breast Assure increases breast
size, Scandurra noted. Rather, Breast Assure's ads say the product
promotes "firm-looking breasts" and "bust enhancement."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Mary Hardy, chief of integrative medicine at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles, said she doesn't see much downside to
the herbal ingredients in the breast-enhancement potions, with one
exception. She noted that Breast Assure contains kava kava, an herbal
relaxant and sleep aid that has been linked to liver failure in half
a dozen reports from Germany and Switzerland. Britain's Medical
Control Council has negotiated the removal of the herb from stores.
The FDA is investigating the herbal supplement.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some reason to be cautious about taking kava kava on a
regular basis until we straighten it out," Hardy said.</TE>
<TE>   Wellquest International, the New York-based maker of Bloussant,
says in print advertisements and television infomercials that its
herbal product can "actually stimulate the inner-cellular substance
in the breast that becomes dormant during the teenage years."
Attempts to reach a company spokesman to clarify that statement were
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Because excessive exposure to estrogen promotes cancer, Dr. Maida
Taylor, a UC San Francisco gynecologist who has studied the effects
of herbs on women's hormones, worries that "anything that stimulates
the breasts like estrogen" might carry similar risks.</TE>
<TE>   Although these supplements are relatively inexpensive compared
with the thousands of dollars a woman might spend on plastic surgery,
they are more than an incidental expense. A 30-day supply (about 180
capsules at the recommended dose) of Breast Assure costs $49.95, plus
another $49.95 if you buy the four-ounce bottle of herbal firming
lotion. A two-month supply of Bloussant costs $229.95, according to
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Wellquest's Web site says some women may be able to stop using
Bloussant once they've achieved "optimum size and firmness," but
others "have to take Bloussant two or three times a week to keep the
firmness and the size."</TE>
<TE>   Breast Assure is recommended for use every day.</TE>
<TE>   Body Wraps</TE>
<TE>   The idea is seductive: Wrap yourself up like a mummy in bandages
drenched in herbal potions, and emerge an hour later inches slimmer.
Suddenly, your favorite jeans or skintight party dress slips on
effortlessly. Indeed, some women who regularly use body wraps swear
by them. And it's certainly become a thriving business.</TE>
<TE>   Day spas and other health and beauty salons throughout Southern
California charge $80 and more for wraps that are said to slice
inches from the waist, thighs, buttocks, calves, arms or tummy.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest companies in the field, Suddenly Slender,
headquartered in Clearwater, Fla., said it has licensed its
proprietary body wrap to more than 1,100 salons in the U.S. and
abroad. Patrons are wrapped from head to toe in cloth bandages that
are soaked in the company's SlenderTone solution, which is said to
contain minerals to help the body purge waste products, tighten skin,
compact tissue, and firm up the body.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors are skeptical that body wrap procedures can
permanently melt away fat or dissolve cellulite, those deposits of
ordinary fatty tissue that women tend to get on their thighs and
buttocks. Any loss of inches or weight is probably temporary, the
result of sweating and water loss in the tissues, these doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   "The change might last for an evening but it wouldn't be
permanent," said Dr. Brian M. Kinney, a Century City plastic surgeon
and spokesman for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. "The
wraps definitely sweat off pounds but when the body reestablishes its
water balance, you gain the weight back."</TE>
<TE>   For some people, looking better for the office party or high
school reunion may be benefit enough to justify the cost.</TE>
<TE>   But doctors warn that, in rare instances, a body wrap may present
a health risk if it causes severe dehydration or circulatory
problems. "Binding yourself up like a mummy can throw you into
hypovolemic shock because not enough blood gets to your brain," said
Dr. Victor D. Herbert, a hematologist at Mt. Sinai Veterans Research
Center in New York, a frequent critic of alternative health
therapies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even these remote risks don't deter people such as Crystal
Barron, a 32-year-old singer from Los Alamitos who used body wraps to
firm up after shedding 30 pounds. Although she didn't notice a loss
of inches, Barron said the wraps "dramatically improved my skin tone,
and smoothed out the cellulite on my legs."</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly a cosmetic wonder," said Lorraine Urbina, a
chiropractor who offers the Suddenly Slender body wrap formula at her
Los Alamitos office. Her customers spend an hour swaddled in cloth
bandages that are dipped in minerals which, she said, draw out the
toxins in the body. The wraps, she said, "compress the fat cells,
making skin look smoother."</TE>
<TE>   The wraps won't, however, "increase muscle mass or get rid of
fat," she added. "Only dieting and exercise will do that."</TE>
<TE>   "There's no medical proof this eliminates fat cells," said Kinney,
the plastic surgeon. "If you wrap part of your body very tightly, it
moves a little bit of fluid around. But that's about it, and it comes
right back."</TE>
<TE>   Chitosan as Diet Aid</TE>
<TE>   The appeal is hard to resist: a capsule that flushes fat out of
the body after it has passed your lips--and before it lands on your
hips.</TE>
<TE>   That's the promise of products containing chitosan, a substance
derived from shellfish that has quickly become one of the most
popular and controversial diet aids on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against several
companies for making deceptive claims about chitosan. In 1999, the
agency won a federal district court case against SlimAmerica Inc.;
the company was ordered to pay $8.3 million for violating consumer
protection laws prohibiting false advertising. In 2000, Enforma
Natural Products Inc., makers of Fat Trapper Plus products, agreed to
pay $10 million to settle an FTC complaint that it made deceptive
weight-loss claims on infomercials, such as "With Enforma, you can
eat what you want and never, ever, ever have to diet again."</TE>
<TE>   Enforma pulled the infomercials off the air but is still locked in
a dispute with the FTC over its marketing practices. The company
continues selling chitosan products and insists they are safe and
effective. "We have a thousand testimonials showing that the Fat
Trapper products work," said Drew Grey, chief executive of Enforma,
which is based in Woodland Hills. He said Enforma used to make some
"heavy claims" about several different products, but that the
weight-loss benefits of chitosan are nonetheless real. "We have a
long list of experts and reliable information to back up our claims,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the products remain popular. Consumers spent nearly $300
million on chitosan products such as Fat Magnets, Fat Trapper Plus
and Chitosol last year, according to Nutrition Business Journal,
which tracks marketing data. "The products are still popular, and the
main reason is that people have heard that you can eat all the fat
you want and still lose weight while using it," said Susan Bowerman,
assistant director of UCLA's Center for Human Nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   In test tube studies, the chitosan molecule quickly binds to fat
molecules, scientists say. When stirred into a container of bacon
grease and water, for example, chitosan preparations can turn the fat
into a big, gelatinous glob that sinks to the bottom--an effect that
was demonstrated on infomercials. "People saw that on the
infomercials and said, 'Wow.' It's very persuasive," said Bowerman.
"But the intestines are full of bicarbonates and acids and all sorts
of things" and it's not yet clear how these interact with the
chitosan.</TE>
<TE>   Enforma officials say numerous research studies support chitosan's
effectiveness as a weight-loss supplement.</TE>
<TE>   But nutrition researchers say the two most scientifically rigorous
trials of chitosan have shown little effect. In one, English
researchers separated 34 overweight volunteers into two groups--one
that received chitosan capsules twice daily and another that got
capsules containing no chitosan. Participants were instructed to
maintain their usual diets. After four weeks, there was no
significant weight reduction in either group, the doctors reported.
In the other experiment, involving 51 obese women, researchers in
Finland reported similar results.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of fat that a few chitosan capsules ferry out of the
body is probably negligible, some nutritionists say. In 2001, UC
Davis researchers studied seven healthy men who were all put on the
same, high-fat diet. The men excreted the same amount of fat in their
feces, whether taking chitosan supplements or not. "I expected to
find some difference, something," said Judith Stern, the lead author.
"But I got nothing, no difference--zero, zip, zilch."</TE>
<TE>   If people who use the products do lose weight, Bowerman said, it
is more likely because of other lifestyle changes, such as exercising
more or consuming fewer calories. "People want to believe it's the
chitosan, but in reality they're following a different regimen."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to any weight-loss product, experts have two words:
caveat emptor. "I don't know what more to say except: Be extremely
skeptical," said Stern. "Weight loss is a daily constant battle and I
know personally of what I speak. It's not because you're bad person
or weak-willed; it's that maybe genes are not so great, and it's just
a fight. It always will be."</TE>
<TE>   Toning the Abs</TE>
<TE>   If you haven't ordered one of those gizmos that apply electric
stimulation to the abs--thus toning and firming the flab-prone
tissue--surely, you've heard about them.</TE>
<TE>   The products, based on technology long used in physical therapy,
are suddenly being touted for use by people who want to get in shape.
One such device has actually received approval from U.S.
regulators--setting it apart from similar ab stimulators. In
September, the Food and Drug Administration for the first time
approved an ab stimulator for toning uninjured muscles. That product,
called Slendertone Flex, is expected to be sold in the United States
later this month, according to the company.</TE>
<TE>   The approval appears to have sparked a race among the
manufacturers of similar products to rev up advertising on their Ab
Energizers, ToneATronics and FastAbs.</TE>
<TE>   But some exercise physiologists remain skeptical that such
products will give the average consumer noticeably tighter, flatter
abs.</TE>
<TE>   "At present there is not a lot of peer-reviewed credible
scientific evidence on how they really work, or if they really work,
in a normal, healthy population," said William J. Kraemer, an
exercise physiologist at the University of Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   A study on ab stimulators, scheduled to be published in the
Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research later this year, shows
that they had no effect on firming abdominal muscles of healthy
people, added Kraemer, who edits the journal.</TE>
<TE>   Electrical stimulation has long been used to help muscles weakened
by illness or injury. By delivering small jolts of electricity, the
stimulators cause the muscle to contract, thereby exercising it. (The
electrical current has to be large enough to cause a contraction, but
weak enough to avoid pain or burns.) Because of their use in
rehabilitative medicine, the products are regulated as medical
devices that require FDA approval prior to marketing.</TE>
<TE>   The agency had long warned consumers against nonmedical uses of
the stimulators. The devices can cause burns and skin irritation or,
placed improperly, could even cause breathing problems or heart
arrhythmia, FDA officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But, they add, the FDA wanted to consider electrical muscle
stimulators for consumer use in order to set some safety standards
and because it appears consumers are going to use them anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly what we were seeing was that these devices are out there
and are being promoted," said Dan Schultz, deputy director for the
FDA's Office for Device Evaluation. "The question at that point
became, what is the best thing for us to do to make sure consumers
were protected and that the information being disseminated was
supported by some scientific data?"</TE>
<TE>   The FDA approved Slendertone Flex because the manufacturer
provided data showing that the device was useful in "firming, toning
and strengthening the abdomen" in people of normal weight who use the
device on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   In Slendertone's study, 72 women were assigned to use the
Slendertone--or nothing--for eight weeks. The women who used the
product showed an average increase in muscle strength of 12% while
the control group showed no such improvement. The women who used
Slendertone also reported improvements in muscle firmness and in
their self-image.</TE>
<TE>   "It typically takes eight weeks to see substantial benefits," said
Colin Lawlor of Bio-Medical Research Ltd., the Irish company that
makes Slendertone Flex. "Like any other exercise, you need to
continue its use two to three times a week to keep the results."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some similar products, which typically sell for $40 to $80,
the $200 Slendertone Flex does not require the use of a gel to affix
the electrodes.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's Schultz cautioned that not everyone who uses the
approved Slendertone Flex device should expect "to look like Arnold
Schwarzenegger." The data, he noted, show that the product "is
reasonably safe, and ... indicates that at least some patients will
have some benefits as far as toning and firming their muscles."</TE>
<TE>   Ab stimulators that lack FDA approval won't necessarily be pulled
from the market, officials said, because the agency is giving
manufacturers an unspecified amount of time to comply with the
approval requirements.</TE>
<TE>   But, they added, consumers who use a product without FDA approval
cannot be assured of the device's safety or effectiveness.</TE>

<HD>First-Timer Feels the Pull (and Push) of Kayaking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AVALON</DL>
<LD>The sun was glinting off the Pacific waters at Descanso Beach, and
Jake Brannock was preparing another kayak for a trip north along the
rugged Catalina Island coastline.</LD>
<LD>   He's a big man with beefy arms whose specialty is ocean kayaking.
On this day he was taking me up the coast to demonstrate the virtues
of the so-called sit-on-top kayak, the type that has revolutionized
the business. Once kayakers were a relatively small niche of
hard-core enthusiasts, involved in a sport that had its origins in
the frozen north.</LD>
<LD>   Now, because of the sit-on-tops, kayaking is a wide-open sport,
suitable for young and old alike. The reason: It's eliminated the
fear of being trapped underwater if the kayak rolls over. Brannock
gave his son an initial kayak ride at 18 months, and the boy promptly
fell asleep. A 90-year-old woman recently celebrated her birthday
with a kayak ride up the Catalina coast.</LD>
<TE>   So here I am, a first-timer, on a deserted beach in the middle of
winter, getting ready to cruise up the coast. I am heartened that I'm
going to be in a sit-on-top, because I frankly don't want to have to
learn how to get out of a kayak if I tip over. Experts have told me
getting out of a kayak isn't terribly difficult, but still.</TE>
<TE>   I've chosen Catalina because a short ferry ride from San Pedro
brings me to a world far removed from crowded Los Angeles. And asking
around about kayaking made the choice a cinch. Catalina is considered
a kayaker's heaven in this part of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "We're probably putting between 200 to 600 people in the water a
day during the summer," said Brannock, a manager and instructor at
Avalon's Descanso Beach Ocean Sports (kayakcatalinais land.com).</TE>
<TE>   On this day, a slightly overcast sky has given way to sunshine,
and several kayakers are on the water, paddling north. They, like me,
don't look like hard-bodied athletes, but they seem to be cruising
along nicely. They look to be good examples of why ocean kayaking has
enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years, as sit-on-tops have
gone from being lumbering bathtubs to much more maneuverable vessels.
The number of kayakers is difficult to come by, though, because
various paddle sports are lumped together by the water sports
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The real answer is that no one has broader statistics than the
end of their nose," said Joanne Turner, owner of Southwind Kayak
Center, an Irvine-based company.</TE>
<TE>   Southwind, for instance, started with six kayaks in 1987. Now the
company owns 160, which are trucked up and down the coast for rentals
and lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps surprisingly, Turner said the largest number of ocean
kayakers range in age from 30 to 65, with the majority in the 40- to
50-year-old range. She said there also is a subgroup of young
families who have discovered kayaking as a way to exercise together
once their children are old enough to swim.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Brodeur, president of the California Kayak Friends club
(www.ckf.org), said that when he took up ocean kayaking at age 40, he
was consistently the youngest person on trips.</TE>
<TE>   "My explanation is that people in their 20s and 30s participate in
high-adrenalin sports," he said. "Kayaking is a lower-adrenalin-type
sport. It's about the same as a brisk walk."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, though, he said multi-day outings are sure fat
burners. "When I come home from one of those, my clothes are sure not
to fit," he said. "Of course, part of it is the terrible freeze-dried
food we have to bring."</TE>
<TE>   Brodeur said there are a number of Southern California kayaking
clubs, as well as Internet list servers where enthusiasts can track
events or just find a paddling partner for the day.</TE>
<TE>   At Catalina, Brannock prepared a Scupper Pro kayak for me. The
50-pound kayak was almost 15 feet long and 26 inches wide, built to
hold between 350 to 400 pounds, kayaker and gear included.</TE>
<TE>   My gear consisted of a pair of waterproof pants, designed to fit
tight at the ankles and protect a large portion of the torso. Also,
there were water shoes to guard against rocks in the shallows, and a
mandatory life jacket. A foul-weather jacket is also recommended, but
moderate temperatures argued not to wear it.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief lecture about how to paddle and what to do in the
unlikely event of landing in the drink, we pushed off from the beach.
In the first moments, the kayak seemed unstable as it rocked from
side to side in the small swells. My 50-something leg muscles
tightened, in what Brannock said is a natural first response to the
slight swaying motion.</TE>
<TE>   But then I dug into the water with my paddle and headed north, out
the small harbor and toward the pristine scenery that is the hallmark
of the island. In a matter of minutes, Avalon was out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   I checked my heart monitor, which in the first minutes climbed to
around 125 and stayed there for most of the paddle. It was, indeed,
like a brisk walk. Brannock, meanwhile, cruised effortlessly by my
side, occasionally pointing out a cormorant as it dove in the water.
What, I asked, is the first step to being a better kayaker?</TE>
<TE>   "You need to push more than you pull," he replied, explaining that
the "push" is for the side of the paddle that is out of the water.
"If you do that, you're using a lot more muscle."</TE>
<TE>   The prescription worked. In little more than half an hour--and
with steady but not overwhelming effort--we were at Frog Rock, a
destination point for novice kayakers located a mile and a quarter up
the coast. As we headed back, Brannock let me pull ahead to feel the
quiet beauty of the place, even as I paddled hard enough to jump my
heart monitor to a high of 168.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we'd returned to Descanso Beach, I was winded and it
was a struggle to stagger out of the kayak. Brannock pulled up a few
moments later and handed me a welcome sugar-loaded cookie.</TE>
<TE>   "We always say that even if the kayaking is bad, the cookie will
help make up for it," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Fitness Snapshot:</TE>
<TE>   Ocean Kayaking</TE>
<TE>   Kayaking is considered moderately strenuous but can be more
strenuous depending on one's level of exertion. It is an aerobic form
of exercise that is better at developing muscle tone than muscle
mass. It works all muscles from the hips up, including shoulders,
forearms, back and abdominals.</TE>
<TE>   Note: It is not recommended for the obese or for those with a
history of back or breathing problems.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuits Mount for Lasik</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandy Keller had simply wanted to correct her nearsightedness and
stop wearing contact lenses when she had laser eye surgery in
September 1999. Instead, she ended up suing her surgeon and
optometrist, claiming that a botched surgery left her with damage so
severe she may eventually need corneal transplants.</LD>
<LD>   The case was settled for $260,000 this last fall. "But no amount
of money is going to fix this," says the 42-year-old Torrance woman,
who now uses an arsenal of medications in her eyes just to get
through the day.</LD>
<LD>   Patients unhappy with the results of Lasik surgery are
increasingly suing doctors and clinics for compensation, complaining
that the procedure actually worsened their vision and, in the most
extreme cases, left them legally blind.</LD>
<TE>   The settlements are encouraging attorneys to pursue additional
cases, even as they shed light on the procedure's risks. Five recent
lawsuits generated judgments in the million-dollar range, and at
least 200 other cases are in the pipeline, according to Washington,
D.C., attorney Aaron M. Levine, chairman of the American Trial
Lawyers Assn.'s Lasik litigation group.</TE>
<TE>   A Buffalo, N.Y., man, for instance, won a $1.2-million verdict
against the doctor and center where he had Lasik surgery after his
eye was lacerated so badly that he is now virtually blind without
corrective lenses. And a Kentucky jury awarded a 38-year-old woman a
record $1.7 million after four laser surgeries left her legally blind
in her left eye.</TE>
<TE>   Lasik, now the most common elective surgery in the United States,
is a $2.4-billion-a-year industry, according to Market Scope, a St.
Louis-based newsletter that tracks the eye surgery business. More
than 4.5 million Americans have had their vision corrected with
lasers since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors have fueled the upswing in the number of lawsuits.
First, there's always a time lag between when a procedure becomes
popular and when problems emerge. Lasik, for example, didn't become
widely available until the late '90s. Lawyers were reluctant to take
the cases because they weren't knowledgeable about the surgery and
because it's difficult to prove damages when there is no objective
test to verify a patient's complaints. "How do you prove your
vision's worse or you're getting spots in your eyes?" says Paul J.
Martinek, editor of Lawyers Weekly USA in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   It also takes time for these claims to wend their way through the
legal system. But the recent judgments have showed that these cases
are winnable, and lawyers have come up to speed on the potential
complications, which has paved the way for more lawsuits. "There's
now a definite momentum," says Levine, who adds that he receives at
least one call a week from an unhappy Lasik patient.</TE>
<TE>   But the lawsuits come at a time when the complication rate is
actually going down, doctors and industry observers say. The tools
used to perform Lasik have been improved, doctors have become more
experienced, and they're better at identifying which patients don't
do well. People with thin corneal tissue, dry eyes, misshapen
eyeballs (astigmatism) or pupils that are large when dilated, for
example, are not good Lasik candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "We've learned so much in the five years we've been doing this,"
says Dr. Roy S. Rubinfeld, an ophthalmologist in Chevy Chase, Md.
Still, he estimates that about one-quarter of his practice consists
of patients with Lasik complications.</TE>
<TE>   Anywhere from 5% to 15% of Lasik patients need a second surgery to
get their vision closer to 20/20, and up to 5% of patients find that
their best corrected vision--with glasses or contact lenses--is
actually worse than before the surgery, according to the Food and
Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Serious complications, which include chronically dry eyes, loss of
night vision, seeing double images or halos, fluctuating vision,
severe headaches, an inability to distinguish objects in dim light
and sensitivity to intense glare, range from 0.5% to 1.5%. With more
than a million people having this done each year, that translates to
5,000 to 15,000 people annually whose vision is seriously impaired by
an elective procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of people with long-standing complications could
populate a small city," says Ron Link, a former firefighter whose
eyes were damaged by laser surgery and who now operates a Web site
(www.surgicaleyes.org) for people with Lasik complications. "These
people often have to radically alter their lifestyles. Anything a
person in civilized society takes for granted, like going to the
movies, candlelight dinners, even just driving to the grocery store,
can be impossible to do."</TE>
<TE>   Lasik, which is a two-step procedure, takes about 10 minutes to
perform and can be done in a doctor's office under local anesthesia.
First, a thin flap on the outer layer of the cornea is peeled back.
Then a laser is used to make a neat incision in the cornea.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have long known that cutting the cornea changes its shape.
And the shape of the cornea determines where light hits the retina,
the light-sensing cells in the back of the eye that control how
clearly the eye sees.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, mistakes fall into three groups: errors in programming
the laser, which can result in overcorrection or astigmatism;
performing surgery on poor candidates; and failure or delay in
diagnosing postoperative complications. "Almost any error you can
imagine someone somewhere has made," says Dr. Robert K. Maloney, an
eye surgeon and director of the Maloney-Seibel Vision Institute in
Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, says attorney Levine, "people are led to believe
this is no more complicated than getting a tooth pulled." Glenn
Hagele, executive director of the Council for Refractive Surgery
Quality Assurance, a consumer watchdog group in Sacramento, says
consumers need to be cautious and informed.</TE>
<TE>   "This procedure offers convenience, but there is some level of
risk," he says. "People need to be aware of the possible consequences
before they consent to go under the knife."</TE>

<LD>It has been called "the forgotten prostate disease." Yet prostatitis
leads to more than 2 million visits to doctors' offices in the United
States each year and is the most common urological problem among men
younger than 50, though older guys can develop it too.</LD>
<LD>   The medical establishment has paid far more attention to prostate
cancer and enlarged prostate in recent years, but that situation is
beginning to change. That is, in part, because of a new federal study
of men with prostatitis that may yield valuable information about how
best to treat this mysterious and often frustrating disease.</LD>
<LD>   Prostatitis is a blanket term for several related conditions with
similar symptoms. Some sufferers develop a frequent and urgent need
to urinate, which is also the key characteristic of an enlarged
prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. Other
symptoms, such as a burning sensation while urinating and erectile
dysfunction, can occur too. The hallmark symptoms of prostatitis,
however, are pain and discomfort in the pelvic area, groin or lower
back.</LD>
<TE>   In some cases, the discomfort is merely annoying, like sitting on
a golf ball. For other patients, though, prostatitis means sheer
anguish. "Some men describe it as feeling like they've been impaled
on a spear," says Clark Hickman, an associate dean at the University
of Missouri-St. Louis. Hickman, a prostatitis sufferer who runs a
telephone support group for the illness, says prostatitis pain can be
so debilitating that some men end up on work disability.</TE>
<TE>   In a small minority of cases, men complaining of prostatitis
symptoms turn up in doctors' offices with severe fever too. That's a
sure sign of acute prostatitis, which is caused by an infection and
is easily treated with antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   However, the majority of men complaining of pain down under don't
have a fever, and they test negative for bacterial infections. Yet
many doctors in this country nonetheless treat these cases of chronic
prostatitis with antibiotics, which are designed to fight infections.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, antibiotics often prove to be worthless in
relieving prostatitis, though many men with the condition end up
taking them for years anyway, risking side effects that can include
gastrointestinal problems and headaches. "[Prostatitis] is often
treated as an infectious disease because we really don't know what
else to do," says University of Maryland urologist Richard Alexander.
He adds, however, that doctors keep prescribing antibiotics to men
with chronic prostatitis because a portion of them feel better if
they take the drugs, even though they don't have an infection.</TE>
<TE>   That may be because the antibiotics act like anti-inflammatory
drugs, says urologist Scott Zeitlin of the UCLA School of Medicine.
Indeed, many prostatitis patients have clear signs of inflammation in
their prostate fluid, which isn't surprising (the suffix "itis"
refers to inflammation). Yet other men experiencing pelvic pain and
other symptoms reveal no signs of inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry if you're confused. "The cause of this condition is
unknown," Zeitlin says. While many theories have been proposed, no
one is sure why men get chronic prostatitis in the first place, he
says. "This all makes chronic prostatitis a very difficult disease to
explain to a patient, and to treat."</TE>
<TE>   Zeitlin and his colleagues at UCLA are conducting a nationwide,
multi-center study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health,
to measure the value of two drugs commonly used to treat chronic
prostatitis. One is Flomax, a medication that's better known as a
treatment for urinary problems linked to BPH. The other drug--the
antibiotic Cipro--became a household word since it's considered the
therapy of choice for anthrax infection. Men with prostatitis who
participate in the study will be given Flomax, Cipro, a combination
of the two drugs or an empty placebo pill for six weeks, then
followed for six weeks to determine whether their symptoms improve.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to other drugs (such as pain relievers), doctors
recommend a wide range of remedies and preventive measures for
chronic prostatitis, though none is guaranteed to work. Sitz baths
(sitting in a tub of warm water) help some men, while some doctors
suggest that men perch on a cushion if they plan to sit for a long
period. Avoiding spicy foods or alcohol and caffeine--all of which
can cause flare-ups in some men--is sometimes recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Ejaculation brings relief for some men, while worsening
prostatitis anguish in others. A technique known as prostatic
massage, first popularized in the early 1900s, appears to be making a
comeback. A doctor inserts a gloved finger into the patient's rectum
and rubs the prostate. The goal is to empty ducts within the gland,
which, if clogged, can cause pain.</TE>
<TE>   This method might be a tough sell to men who freak out when it's
time for the annual digital rectal exam, especially because several
massages per week are necessary (some men even learn to
self-massage). But Zeitlin and urologist Daniel Shoskes of the
Cleveland Clinic in Weston, Fla., found in one study that about 40%
of difficult-to-treat prostatitis cases improved with a combination
of massage and antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   Zeitlin and Shoskes also found in a 1999 study, published in the
journal Urology, that 82% of men with prostatitis who took a dietary
supplement called Prosta-Q (whose main active ingredient is the plant
nutrient quercetin) experienced at least a small improvement in
symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   However, other clinicians are skeptical. "No one really knows
what's in this stuff but the people who make it," says University of
Maryland urologist Richard Alexander, noting that the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration doesn't regulate the content and purity of
dietary supplements.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander is a leading proponent of the theory that chronic
prostatitis may be an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the
body's immune system attacks its own organs or tissues. He is
studying whether men with chronic prostatitis benefit from the drug
Enbrel, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, another
autoimmune disease. However, Alexander adds, there's often no
accounting for how prostatitis patients will respond to various
therapies for this baffling condition.</TE>

<LD>PAIN FREE FOR WOMEN: The Revolutionary Program</LD>
<LD>   for Ending Chronic Pain</LD>
<LD>   By Pete Egoscue with Roger Gittines</LD>
<TE>   Bantam Books</TE>
<TE>   446 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps I was in the right frame of mind when I picked up this
book--I had just joined a gym and, after a flare-up of tendinitis,
was paying close attention to my posture, alignment and use of my
joints and muscles. So I was ready to listen to Pete Egoscue's
message.</TE>
<TE>   Egoscue, an exercise physiologist, says that our bodies need the
proper support to function at their best. Though we all have some
musculoskeletal imperfections--maybe one leg is slightly longer or
one hip slightly higher--it's possible to compensate. When you're
hunched over and tensed up, your body doesn't work efficiently, he
says. Pain and tenderness set in, you get cranky, stop moving and,
all of a sudden, you're one big ball of dysfunction, not to mention
vulnerable to illness. But it need not be so. As Egoscue so wisely
puts it: "Motion begets motion."</TE>
<TE>   The author, who runs a San Diego-area pain clinic, has spent more
than two decades helping clients (including professional athletes)
strengthen muscles, gain flexibility and improve their posture and
body alignment through simple exercises and stretches used in yoga,
physical therapy and other disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   This book, written specifically for women, provides an exercise
program designed to alleviate or prevent chronic pain of the back,
neck or joints. You won't find weight-lifting or machines here. You
will find fundamental ways to use your own muscles and the natural
resistance of your body to achieve better posture, strength and
flexibility. The program can be tailored for various phases of
life--childhood, adolescence, the 20s, middle age, pregnancy,
post-pregnancy and the senior years--with the exercises demonstrated
by real-life women in each stage. Surely, the approach is worth a
try.</TE>

<TE>   THE SECRET LIFE OF THE BRAIN</TE>
<TE>   Co-produced by David Grubin Productions Inc. and Thirteen/</TE>
<TE>   WNET New York PBS</TE>
<TE>   A five-part series, beginning Jan. 22, 9-11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone familiar with PBS science specials will recognize the
polished, orderly look of this new series on the human brain. But
although the program is similar to documentaries we have seen
before--with microscopic views of brain cells, interviews with
doctors and cameras trailing people receiving medical therapies--the
content breaks new ground.</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret Life of the Brain" dispels many myths, such as the
idea that we lose vast amounts of neural cells as we age. The
emerging concept of the brain is that it's a remarkably adaptable
organ that is capable of performing beautifully well into our senior
years.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding the brain means understanding ourselves, no matter
what our age. The five parts of the series explore the brain during
infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the third segment, on the adolescent brain, offers a
new paradigm for understanding teenagers. Although psychosocial
development and hormones play a big role in how teenagers act,
scientists explain that a growth spurt in the brain's prefrontal
cortex is most likely responsible for teenagers' struggles with
reasoning, emotions, impulse control and judgment.</TE>
<TE>   And, in the final episode, scientists provide good support for the
notion that even old brains can be great brains as long as people use
them. In other words, if you want to learn French or how to play the
piano at age 70, go for it.</TE>

<LD>Think your fitness routine works all your body's muscle groups? What
about the muscles of your face?</LD>
<LD>   Sports Club/LA in Washington, D.C., offers a 30-minute class,
called Face Val U, said to help firm--and improve blood flow
to--muscles with names you may never have heard, such as the platysma
of the neck and frontalis of the forehead.</LD>
<LD>   Valeria Georgescu's "nonsurgical face-lift" exercises are designed
to tighten and tone facial muscles, which stretch and tighten the
skin, thereby easing the appearance of wrinkles. The veteran fitness
instructor began offering the classes several months ago after
watching aerobics students squint and pinch their faces while working
out.</LD>
<TE>   "It works for busy people at lunch. You don't have to change, you
don't sweat, and you can come in any type of clothes," said Bobby
Mellott, the club's group exercise manager.</TE>
<TE>   Sports Club/LA hopes to begin offering similar classes at its
locations in Los Angeles and New York.</TE>
<TE>   But you do need to do your homework for best results. Students are
advised to attend at least two classes each week and to do the
20-minute program on their own twice weekly.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've all read the studies that say taller men tend to get better
jobs, have happier marriages and do better overall in life than their
shorter counterparts. But in one instance, at least, shorter is
better. A poll conducted by University of Washington researchers in
Seattle found that men taller than 6 feet, 1 inch had almost 2 1/2
times the risk of developing melanoma, an often fatal form of skin
cancer, as those who were shorter than 5-foot-8.</LD>
<LD>   In a telephone survey of 386 recently diagnosed melanoma patients
and 727 randomly selected people, the subjects were queried about
their age, gender, weight, height, diet, sun exposure, sun
sensitivity, exercise and income level. Even when other variables
were factored in, there was a significant link between the risk of
melanoma and height.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers believe that the increased risk was due to the
obvious: Taller men have more skin, so they have more of the pigment
cells where melanomas develop. Yet the link between height and
increased skin cancer risk didn't hold true for women; researchers
speculate they have different sun-worshiping habits.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors have recommended for the first time that newborns receive a
vaccination--for hepatitis B--before they leave the hospital. Under
the previous guidelines, the first hepatitis B shot (part of a
three-shot series) was given to infants at 2 months of age, although
it was given shortly after birth to newborns of mothers known to have
the viral disease. Infants can contract the disease during childbirth
from exposure to the mother's blood, but immediate vaccination can
prevent the virus from taking hold.</LD>
<LD>   Giving the vaccine to all newborns in the hospital reduces the
chance that a baby will be exposed to hepatitis B by mothers who are
mistakenly thought to be free of the disease. Hepatitis B, which is a
sexually transmitted disease, can cause serious health problems,
including liver failure, later in life.</LD>
<LD>   The change in the hepatitis B vaccine is part of the annual
immunization schedule update from the federal government and the
American Academy of Pediatrics. For the first time in recent years,
no new shots were recommended to the immunization schedule.</LD>

<HD>Recognizing and Responding to the Signs of Progressive
Hearing Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the most heartwarming events we can attend are family
celebrations that span the generations. At these gatherings, there's
always plenty of noise and laughter, with children everywhere. But
perhaps you notice Grandma or Grandpa sitting quietly on the
sidelines, not engaged in the conversations, looking left out.</LD>
<LD>   Is Grandma depressed? Is Grandpa, who is well past 80, getting
senile? The answer to those questions may be no. The real problem, in
some cases, may be major hearing loss. They're not reacting to anyone
because they simply can't hear what anyone is saying.</LD>
<LD>   More than 20 million Americans suffer similarly. About one-third
of adults between 65 and 75, and up to one-half of those 75 and older
have significant hearing loss. (Hearing loss disproportionately
affects the elderly, but it is not uncommon in younger people.)</LD>
<TE>   For those who hear normally, it is difficult to imagine the
negative impact that even mild to moderate hearing loss can have on
someone's life. It can get so difficult to communicate with others
that personal relationships are strained, problems arise at work and
it becomes impossible to enjoy even simple activities, such as
watching television or seeing a movie. In some instances, hearing
loss can impose real danger--for example, when fire alarms or smoke
detectors cannot be heard.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, hearing loss remains one of the most
under-recognized and under-treated medical conditions in the United
States. Experts estimate that about 80% of men and women with
significant loss are not receiving proper treatment. All too often,
this occurs because treatment options are too expensive or are deemed
cosmetically unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   But many people fail to get the treatment they need because they
don't even realize a problem exists. They lose their hearing so
gradually that they're not aware that it's slipping away. They make
unconscious accommodations for their declining hearing--by turning up
the television volume or staying away from noisy places like
restaurants. Though these strategies may work for a while, they
usually fail as hearing loss becomes more severe.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment for hearing loss, of course, depends on the cause.
In some cases, medications or surgery may correct the underlying
problem and produce a dramatic improvement. Much more commonly,
hearing aids are prescribed to boost the level of sound that
ultimately reaches the internal part of the ear.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing aid technology has advanced greatly in the last decade,
and many models of hearing aids can now be programmed to accommodate
the specific hearing level and needs of each user. Some aids, for
example, can be programmed to boost the volume of only the frequency
ranges where hearing loss has occurred. These high-tech features,
however, are expensive. A modern programmable aid that uses digital
technology can cost upward of $2,000. (A "conventional" aid costs
$600 to $1,000.) Unfortunately, most medical insurance--including
Medicare--does not cover the cost of hearing aids, which keeps many
people from getting the treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Other devices have been developed to help in situations where
communication may be difficult even with a hearing aid. To facilitate
telephone conversation, for example, handsets with built-in
amplifiers are available at a reasonable cost. And television viewing
can now be pleasant for everyone in the room, thanks to wireless
systems that use light or radio waves to transmit the TV sound to a
headset, allowing the television itself to operate at normal volume.
(Many movie theaters employ this same type of listening system and
offer receivers to patrons who need them.) Even the most expensive
hearing aids do not restore hearing to "normal," so good listening
skills are essential. The following simple techniques can improve
anyone's ability to function.</TE>
<TE>   * Always face the person you are addressing, and stay focused on
what is being said.</TE>
<TE>   * Let people know that you have hearing loss. Ask them to speak
clearly and at a reasonable rate and volume. If necessary, ask them
to slow down, speak up, or repeat or rephrase what they said.</TE>
<TE>   When in a group, request that only one person speak at a time.
Also remember that communication is particularly difficult when there
is a lot of background noise such as from television, the stereo or
even a household appliance. Seek out relatively quiet places for your
conversations, and you'll get more out of them.</TE>

<TE>   To see if you have early warning signs of hearing loss, ask
yourself the following questions. (If you suspect family members or
friends may have significant hearing loss, share this questionnaire
with them as well.)</TE>
<TE>   1. Do you have a problem hearing on the telephone?</TE>
<TE>   2. Do you have trouble hearing when there is background noise?</TE>
<TE>   3. Is it hard for you to follow a conversation when two or more
people talk at once?</TE>
<TE>   4. Do you have to strain to understand a conversation?</TE>
<TE>   5. Do many people you talk to seem to mumble or not speak clearly?</TE>
<TE>   6. Do you misunderstand what others are saying and respond
inappropriately?</TE>
<TE>   7. Do you often ask people to repeat themselves?</TE>
<TE>   8. Do you have trouble understanding the speech of women and
children?</TE>
<TE>   9. Do people complain that you turn the television volume up too
loud?</TE>
<TE>   If you answered yes to two or more of these questions, you should
consult with a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and
treatment of hearing disorders (an otolaryngologist or
otologist--often referred to as a "head and neck doctor").</TE>
<TE>   You should also have a formal hearing test by an audiologist.</TE>

<LD>Question: I'm 32, have two children younger than 3 and work out three
times a week. I'm looking for a solid middle after these two
pregnancies. What else can I do?</LD>
<LD>   KAREN MOORE</LD>
<LD>   Beaverton, Ore.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: I don't know what your three-times-a-week workouts consist
of, but I'm sure it's a great start.</TE>
<TE>   To specifically lose your middle, you need to do several
things--not just ab work.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, spot reducing doesn't work. If we have any excess fat
on our bodies (like around our stomach), we need to reduce our
overall body fat to get rid of it.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that this can be done by combining a sensible
diet with a well-rounded workout routine.</TE>
<TE>   First, try to eat four to six small meals throughout the day.
Because your body will use the food as fuel, rather than storing it
as fat, this will help keep your metabolism high.</TE>
<TE>   Second, to achieve maximum fitness results, your workouts should
be a combination of cardiovascular work and resistance training.</TE>
<TE>   I recommend some form of cardiovascular exercise (running,
walking, elliptical machine, stationary bike, swimming, hiking, etc.)
three to five times a week for 20 to 60 minutes at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Third, resistance or strength training is also an essential part
of an effective workout program.</TE>
<TE>   Keep your resistance routine fresh.</TE>
<TE>   If your body is constantly challenged by frequently changing
exercises, intensity, and the order in which you do them, your body
will respond faster.</TE>
<TE>   And, as for your abs: Work them hard enough to stimulate muscle
growth, but allow enough rest between sessions so your muscles can
recover.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, you should do three sets of exercises, such as crunches,
three or four times per week, with 10 to 12 repetitions of each
exercise.</TE>

<HD>Stretch Your Way to Stress Reduction and Better Relaxation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN VOIGHT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stress reduction and relaxation probably sound good to you these
days. If so, stretching can be the road to help you get there.</LD>
<LD>   If you follow a consistent stretch program, not only will your
body feel calmer, but your movements will become smoother, more
coordinated and more graceful. With regular stretching, you'll know
what your physical limitations are. You'll quickly learn how far you
can extend or bend your body in a variety of angles. This translates
to added control, precision and power in any activity you do.</LD>
<LD>   Ideally you should create a state of relaxation whenever you
stretch. Relaxation is a motor skill. It's the ability to keep
certain muscles still and unaffected by movements that the rest of
your body is doing. For example, when you are using your arms to pull
your leg into a stretch, it is as important for you to keep your leg
muscles relaxed as it is for you to engage your arm muscles. There
should be no tension or extra movement created by your leg. If your
leg is relaxed, your leg muscles will respond better to the stretch.</LD>
<TE>   It's best to stretch immediately after lifting weights or after an
aerobic workout, but short "stretch breaks" at work or throughout
your day can also be beneficial. In any case, you need to follow a
few basics to get the most from your time and to keep your stretching
safe.</TE>
<TE>   First, make sure that your muscles are always warm. Think of them
as taffy. Cold taffy will resist and snap when pulled, but warm taffy
is much more pliable and prone to lengthening. This might mean taking
a warm shower, turning up the heat in your room or going for a brisk
walk around the block to get your body warmed up.</TE>
<TE>   Next, you'll need to let go of any stress you are feeling and
learn to concentrate on yourself. When you are doing a stretch, focus
on the sensations happening inside your body. Stop thinking about
anything else that's going on around you. Once you are at the
furthest point of your stretch, stay quiet and still. Focus on
breathing in and out slowly. Hold each of your stretches 30 seconds
or longer. This is called static stretching and gives your muscles
enough time to release tension and become longer.</TE>
<TE>   Practice these two static leg stretches to relieve tightness in
your calves and the backs of your thighs.</TE>
<TE>   1. Hamstring Stretch</TE>
<TE>   Lie down face up on a mat or cushioned surface with both knees
bent and your feet flat on the floor. Bend your right knee to your
chest and place a folded towel or stretch band around the ball of
your foot. Keep your head, shoulders and hips on the floor as you
gently extend your right leg. Move your leg forward or backward until
you find the point where you can fully straighten your knee.</TE>
<TE>   With your arms' strength, slowly pull your toes down, allowing
your heel to point upward. You should feel the back of your leg
lengthening as you hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds. Breathe
comfortably, and repeat on the other leg.</TE>
<TE>   2. Calf Stretch</TE>
<TE>   Begin by sitting on your heels with your knees resting on the
floor. To stretch your right calf muscles, bring your right knee in
front of your chest and place your right foot flat on the floor. Your
heel should be moved as far back to your hip as possible. Place your
fingertips on the ground for balance.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly lean your torso forward, pressing your knee forward over
your toes. Make sure that most of your weight remains over your right
heel. Don't roll on your toes or let your heel come off the floor.
Breathe comfortably as you stretch for 30 to 60 seconds, and repeat
on the other leg.</TE>
<TE>   Remember that relaxation is the opposite of tension. To achieve a
relaxed state, you must learn to concentrate on what is happening
inside your body as you stretch slowly and gently. Then, at the point
of maximum stretch, make sure you exhale deeply. Done consistently,
this method of stretching can help you achieve a deep and satisfying
sense or relaxation.</TE>

<HD>When a Teenage Girl's Reputation Hangs on a Single Word</HD>
<DH>Those stigmatized by the sexual epithet say the damage is
devastating and long-lasting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the young woman's name was posted on a Web site in the summer
of 2000 under the category of "ugliest girl" in her entering
10th-grade class at Agoura High School, a rumor spread that there was
a videotape of her having sex with several boys. Classmates then
began calling her "whore" and "slut," sexual epithets potent in their
sting even in this postfeminist, sexually liberated era.</LD>
<LD>   Alison Goller, now 17, has left Agoura High School. A lawsuit was
filed on her behalf against the Las Virgenes Unified School District
in a Los Angeles federal court charging that school officials did
nothing to stop "the escalating pattern of sexual harassment" by
other students.</LD>
<LD>   Administrators from the school district said the district "did
everything it was required to do."</LD>
<TE>   Although the word "slut" is now used as humor in everything from
punch lines to wedding cards (one crudegreetings.com card begins with
the usual congratulations, followed by the sentiment, "I guess this
means you'll have to stop being a slut") to marketing ploys (Blue Q
soap has a "Virgin soap" and a "Slut soap"), the term is nothing
short of devastating for young women in the fragile, formative years
of their sexual coming of age.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it is ever appropriate to use the word with teenage
girls," said Leora Tanenbaum, author of "Slut! Growing Up Female With
a Bad Reputation" (HarperCollins, 2000). Tanenbaum said she was
stigmatized by the word in the ninth grade, a reputation that stuck
through her senior year.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is the word means a woman of loose character who
has something fundamentally wrong with her. What's wrong with her is
she has sexual desire. You don't have to do anything sexual to be
called a slut. Most of the [50] girls I interviewed had little or no
sexual experience. Being clean-cut does not make one immune."</TE>
<TE>   To be pegged a slut is to be an outsider, according to Emily White
in her new book "Fast Girls: Teenage Tribes and the Myth of Slut"
(Scribner), scheduled for release in March.</TE>
<TE>   White's book reveals young girls and women at the mercy of a
cultural and sexual double standard, the center of the sordid "slut"
maelstrom for which there is no male equivalent. ("Stud" and "player"
are congratulatory slang). Being labeled with the word was a defining
experience that tore many young women's lives asunder, according to
White, a Seattle-based writer who interviewed 100 girls and women
across the country who reported being labeled during their
adolescence.</TE>
<TE>   "The slut myth is rooted in ancient fears of the devouring
female," said White, referring to the mythology of the sexually
insatiable woman whose desires threaten to consume men. "It's also
rooted in fear of female power. The myth is a way of putting girls in
their place in a decisive way, so we learn early that girls will be
ostracized if they go beyond certain limits."</TE>
<TE>   White found that teenagers most likely to be victimized by the
epithet fit a pattern. They had developed breasts and hips when peers
were still in training bras; departed from the norm (transferred into
a school, had a lengthy absence or dyed their hair, say, blue); were
extroverts (girls who cussed, talked dirty or wore short skirts); or
felt like an outcast. As one 14-year-old San Francisco girl explained
in White's book, the kids at her school believe that just because she
bleaches her hair blond she'll also perform oral sex for cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Girls use the epithet against each other as well, which White says
is designed to lower each other's status, to strike a blow at a girl
who garners too much male attention or to retaliate for a real or
perceived wrong (stealing a boyfriend or flirting with someone's
boyfriend).</TE>
<TE>   Young men use the rumor that they engaged in some sexual act (oral
sex is a favorite) with a "slut" to inflate their reputation, to take
revenge on an ex-girlfriend or to get even with a young woman who
spurned an advance.</TE>
<TE>   The truth doesn't get in the way of a sexual rumor. "I interviewed
plenty of girls who were virgins the whole time the rumor
proliferated, but I also interviewed girls who were promiscuous,"
said White. "The stories never matched up to what actually happened,
so there was a profound dissonance going on for these young women."</TE>
<TE>   Sexual rumors are nearly impossible to refute, said White, and
they can shadow young women through their senior year and sometimes
to college. "The rumors are intractable because of the irrational
atmosphere in which they spread," said White. "Things get
exaggerated, and there is no way for a girl to argue against it
because whenever she does, people assume she is guilty."</TE>
<TE>   Human sexuality educators such as Deborah Roffman, who teaches in
Baltimore-area schools, are most disturbed by the sexual double
standard inherent in the word. "The word is a pejorative,
discriminatory label and a weapon of social power," said Roffman,
author of the forthcoming book "But How'd I Get in There in the First
Place? Talking to Your Young Child About Sex" (Perseus). "Embedded in
the word is all the cultural double standards regarding sex. A girl
does something sexual, and she gets condemned while a boy gets
congratulated. The underlying assumption is that a boy is a sex
machine. If a sexual act happens, the girl is responsible and held
morally accountable because a boy is never going to say no."</TE>
<TE>   While the tribal culture of high school, television and movies
(the oversexed girl always gets killed first in horror movies)
contribute to the proliferation of the slut story, adult attitudes
are also responsible. After a boy at a Baltimore-area private school
showed a videotape of himself having sex with a girl to his lacrosse
teammates last spring, the schools in the surrounding community were
rocked to their cores. The young men were punished, and apologies
were made to the girl.</TE>
<TE>   But the mother of another girl who attended a nearby school
remarked: "If it weren't for that slut, the boys wouldn't have gotten
in trouble." When a junior who was taking Roffman's class heard the
remark and approached the mother about her comment, the mother
replied sarcastically, "Aren't we sensitive."</TE>
<TE>   Many girls and young women branded as the slut (it happened in
middle school for some) internalized the rumors and were subsequently
haunted by a lingering negative self-image. Some attempted or
contemplated suicide. Many women blamed a string of failed
relationships on the wounds left by their years of being labeled a
slut.</TE>
<TE>   Others moved away in an effort to escape their feelings of anger
and resentment that still brewed. But it seems few of the women White
interviewed ever completely outgrew the rumor.</TE>

<LD>NEW CARDIFF</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Charles Webb</LD>
<TE>   Washington Square Press</TE>
<TE>   354 pages, $14, paper</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When you think of "The Graduate," you most likely remember Dustin
Hoffman and Anne Bancroft's boffo performances as bemused young hero
and sultry aging seductress in Mike Nichols' stylish 1967 movie. But
before the movie there was Charles Webb's first novel of the same
name, on which the film was based. Especially notable for the fact
that it contained an exceptionally high proportion of dialogue, "The
Graduate" attracted little attention on its publication in 1963. But
it was inevitable that from the time the movie appeared, Webb's
subsequent fiction would forever be adorned--and burdened--by the
link with that defining cultural icon of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Webb went on to write half a dozen more novels into the 1970s,
then stopped. After a 25-year hiatus, he has returned to fiction with
another bemused, if not quite so young, hero. Colin Ware, the
protagonist of "New Cardiff," is a mild-mannered Englishman who gets
to look at love from both sides of the Atlantic. Reeling from the
shock of being coldly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, Vera, Colin
flees England, the scene of his heartbreak and humiliation, for what
he hopes will be a restorative sojourn in America.</TE>
<TE>   For no particular reason, he lands in New Cardiff, a picturesque
New England town framed by the brilliant colors of fall foliage.
Something about the place appeals to Colin, and he settles in at a
motel run by an obliging couple named the Fishers. Mr. Fisher gamely
agrees to sit for a portrait. (Colin is an artist who likes drawing
faces that strike him as interesting.) Mrs. Fisher arranges for Colin
to receive the therapeutic attentions of her friend Mandy, a
professional caregiver who works at a local old-age home.</TE>
<TE>   Mandy's winsome ways strike a responsive chord in Colin: "Two
people who are naked together don't have to have sex ... any more
than two people with their clothes on are necessarily not going to
have it," she explains, after suggesting to Colin that they both get
undressed. "Naked people may have it more," he replies. "I don't know
if there have been studies."</TE>
<TE>   Before long, Colin and Mandy have become an item. Impulsive,
unsophisticated, affectionate and kindhearted, Mandy is pretty much
the opposite of Vera in every way. She even has a knack for helping
Colin find interesting people to sit for him. Everything is going
swimmingly when Vera shows up. As Colin has explained to Mandy, he
and Vera go way back: Before they were lovers, they were childhood
friends, and before that, as Vera guilefully informs the guileless
Mandy, their mothers met while pregnant with them. Vera regrets the
rash act that drove Colin away, and she's determined to get him back.</TE>
<TE>   Webb once again tells his story largely through dialogue,
displaying his considerable flair for comedy, not to mention his
sharp ear for the voices of his characters and the cadences of
contemporary conversation. The scenes in which Colin tells his
romantic troubles to the Fishers are particularly funny. (Mr. Fisher,
after giving the matter due consideration, suggests to Colin that the
most likely reason Vera broke off their relationship so suddenly is
that some cult must have gotten hold of her.) Webb, who like Colin
has lived on both sides of the Atlantic, has a great deal of fun
gently and affectionately satirizing both sets of national
characteristics. Webb's artist wife, Fred, contributes an additional
amusing touch with illustrations that are supposed to be Colin's
sketches of the various people he's met in the course of the story.</TE>
<TE>   The novel's considerable charms, however, may not be enough to
allay the suspicions of at least some readers who may wonder if
Colin's attachment to Mandy is not based on the same kind of romantic
idealization that had rendered him blind to Vera's flaws for so many
years. Mandy, to be sure, is very different from Vera: as innocent as
Vera is designing, as modest as Vera is pretentious, as kind as Vera
is spiteful. But she also has a stubborn streak and sounds a bit
childish at times. ("You seem ... like someone who wouldn't get mad
at me," she tells Colin at one point.) Will Colin notice poor Mandy's
flaws and flee farther west (perhaps Australia?), to meet another
woman who at first glance looks better than his last woman? Or will
Mandy become disillusioned if Colin ever does "get mad" at her?</TE>
<TE>   But for those not inclined to cavil at such minor blemishes, "New
Cardiff" is a good-natured, consistently amusing romp through the
vicissitudes of no-longer-so-young love.</TE>

<DH>The duchess of York and the director of an acclaimed film
spice things up at a West Hollywood bookstore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN CRAUGHWELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's ridiculously early on Sunset Boulevard--7:30 a.m., to be
exact--when two women from the Santa Clarita Valley pitch their
collapsible camping chairs on the sidewalk in front of Book Soup, the
popular West Hollywood independent bookstore. The store will not open
for another hour and a half.</LD>
<LD>   The two have trekked from their suburb to this trendy stretch to
meet Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York and Weight Watchers
spokeswoman, who will sign copies of her new book, "Energy
Breakthrough."</LD>
<LD>   Later, Book Soup will be swamped with cineastes and lovers of
serious fiction for a reading of short stories written by the late
Andre Dubus, whose short story "Killings" is the basis for the
acclaimed film "In the Bedroom." The film's director, Todd Field,
will be among the readers.</LD>
<TE>   The two events last Wednesday, showcasing authors who could not be
more different, reflect the polymorphous nature of this city's
literary life. And for Book Soup, this will be a long and challenging
day.</TE>
<TE>   Around 10:30 a.m., general manager Allison Hill surveys the
burgeoning line of Fergie fans on the sidewalk. "This is definitely
not our archetypal crowd," she says. "But that's why we like to do
these events. It draws people who normally wouldn't come to Book
Soup."</TE>
<TE>   By 11 a.m., the crowd includes a Fergie look-alike, several royal
watchers and a clutch of professional autograph collectors. The
majority seem to be women in various stages of the Weight Watchers
program. They bide their time comparing before and after photos and
talking about Ferguson's appearance on a local TV show earlier that
morning. Some even have brought portable televisions with them.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a ringleader among the group, it's Lisa Mundy, a nanny
from Hancock Park who runs a Fergie fan site
(community.webtv.net/puttputt32/Sarah) and knows a lot about the
former royal: "If you need any information about Sarah--shoe size,
mother's maiden name--just let me know."</TE>
<TE>   Mundy, who arrived just after the Santa Clarita contingent, has
met the duchess 15 times, traveling as far as Atlanta, New Orleans
and New York to attend her public appearances, but still chugs an
entire bottle of Pepto-Bismol to calm her nervous stomach.</TE>
<TE>   The duchess and entourage--her publicist, personal assistant, a
Weight Watchers executive and two private security men--arrive in a
black GMC Yukon Denali SUV at 11:15 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the Fergie-mania a UPS man delivers a shipment of books from
Harper Collins (it includes 20 copies of Anthony Bourdain's "Kitchen
Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly," six of Robert
McKee's screenwriting bible "Story," as well as classics by James
Joyce and others).</TE>
<TE>   Although the store's staff and Ferguson's security men have been
keeping an eye on the crowd, which now numbers about 75 (not
including a dozen or so photographers), Hill surveys the line one
last time at 12:20 to "make sure there are no surprises."</TE>
<TE>   At a previous Fergie signing at the store, someone pulled out
photos of Princess Diana and asked her to sign them. (She refused.)
No one is quite that tacky this time, but one person has a video
camera that Hill and the store's marketing and publicity director Jen
Ramos decide to ban.</TE>
<TE>   Autograph collector and purveyor Richard Rivera of Anaheim calls
to Hill, "I go to a lot of these signings, and I expected a bigger
crowd, but, honey, there are so many queens in this neighborhood, I
guess not that many people are interested in a duchess!"</TE>
<TE>   After a short TV taping and a private meeting with two women who
have won a Weight Watchers competition (between them they have shed
110 pounds), the svelte duchess borrows Hill's office for a quick
Weight Watchers-approved lunch of fruit and chicken.</TE>
<TE>   The store has asked autograph seekers to wait outside the store,
but a middle-aged woman runs into the store gasping, "I'm trying to
avoid the media. I'm supposed to be at work!" Hill lets her hide out
in the stacks while the woman's friend holds her spot in line.</TE>
<TE>   At 12:40 p.m., Book Soup owner Glenn Goldman, who founded the
store 26 years ago while a graduate student at UCLA, warily makes his
way into the Fergie Zone. Goldman has spent the morning upstairs in
his office with Sandy Pollack, a sales rep/territory manager for
Random House, talking about upcoming spring titles. While he's
extremely hands-on with book buying--he selects over 90% of the
titles--he is reticent when it comes to public events.</TE>
<TE>   Max Magee, who has worked at the store for a month and a half, is
assigned to help Ferguson at the back counter, where the signing will
take place. On the counter are a dozen black Sharpie markers and a
simple arrangement of orange roses.</TE>
<TE>   At 12:45, Ramos ushers in a group of photographers, most of whom
work for foreign news agencies. They snap away as Ferguson holds up a
copy of her book, then pretends to read from it.</TE>
<TE>   A cockney-accented photographer calls out, "'Allo, ma'am. Does
'avin' us 'ere make you feel at home a bit then?" Fergie, smiling for
the cameras, ignores him.</TE>
<TE>   The duchess efficiently signs the piles of books her fans place
before her (most have two or three; some have 10). While her answers
to questions about weight loss range from canned--"Don't wait to lose
weight" --to slightly unseemly--"If there's anything we've learned
from Sept. 11, it's don't wait, life is too short"--her interactions
with fans she recognizes from previous events are genuinely warm. She
asks about their children, often remembering names and even ages, and
answers questions about her own two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   The one snag seems to be finding music appropriate for a duchess.
The staff tries a jazz radio station, but the Weight Watchers exec
asks for something "more contemporary." After a few minutes of
cha-cha, someone rounds up a Van Morrison CD.</TE>
<TE>   A few people have odd requests. Art student Jen Kolmel hands her
Polaroid camera to Ferguson so that Ferguson can photograph her, then
autograph the bottom white strip. Self-help author Wendy Scott ("Meet
Divine Mother") gets an autograph and then hands a request for a
recollection piece by Ferguson for a Princess Diana book she is
writing to Ferguson's publicist, Gerry Casanova.</TE>
<TE>   When Ferguson doppelganger Robin Aulger approaches the counter,
Ferguson doesn't seem to notice the uncanny resemblance until she
hands the signed book back to Aulger and then she does a double take.
Autograph collector Rivera has Ferguson sign two of her "Budgie"
children's books, which he will put up for auction on EBay. "I won't
take less than $150 per book," he says. At 1:50 p.m., the event is
over. Casanova looks around admiringly. "What an unusual space," he
says. "It's such a beautiful bookstore."</TE>
<TE>   The staff seems relieved when the cameras and crowds are gone, in
much the same way children are when their parents' embarrassing
friends leave after a too-long party. It's not that they're not used
to famous people being in the store--quite the opposite. A-list
actors and directors routinely patronize Book Soup because the staff
is discreet. When magazines like InStyle and Movieline call looking
for celebrity sightings, the store's policy is not to comment.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, things are back to normal for Book Soup. Author
Bruce Wagner calls to check on an upcoming Writers' Bloc event; the
Filofax rep pops into Hill's office with a juicy bit of bookstore
gossip; KCRW-FM's "Bookworm" host Michael Silverblatt makes his
almost daily pilgrimage; customers quietly peruse the
floor-to-ceiling stacks.</TE>
<TE>   The shelves contain more than 65,000 titles, although the exact
number is unknown, even to Goldman. The store has not conducted a
complete inventory in 31/2 years (Ah, the of luxury of being
independent. ).</TE>
<TE>   As the sun sets behind Tower Records across the boulevard, Ramos,
who has been fighting the flu all day, sets up rows of folding metal
chairs in Book Soup Addendum, the store's annex for discounted books.</TE>
<TE>   The 6:30 p.m. reading of Andre Dubus stories is officially billed
as a promotion for the Vintage Books collection of Dubus' short
stories. Unofficially, however, the event is part of Miramax's Oscar
campaign for "In the Bedroom," which has already received accolades,
including a best picture award from the Los Angeles Film Critics.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Bedroom" director and co-writer Todd Field and cast
members Nick Stahl and William Mapother are scheduled to read, as is
local writer and friend-of-Book Soup Aimee Bender. Stahl bows out due
to illness; actor Justin Ashforth fills in.</TE>
<TE>   By 5:45 p.m., all seats have been taken. A crowd stands in the
back of the room. This reading has drawn about the same number of
folks who turned out for Fergie, but the vibe is more mellow. Only
two photographers have shown up; one is shooting for Miramax. Sarah
Simons, manager of the Addendum, leaves before the reading begins, as
does Ramos, whose flu has become worse. Hill sticks around for a
while, but the event seems to be running itself.</TE>
<TE>   Bender reads "They Now Live in Texas," Ashforth reads "Leslie in
California"; Mapother reads "A Love Song," and Field finishes with
"Delivering."</TE>
<TE>   No one reads "Killings," the story "In the Bedroom" is based on,
because Field does not want to give away the ending for those who
haven't seen his film.</TE>
<TE>   Dubus died in 1999, but that doesn't stop hard-core autograph
seekers. A dozen or so people ask Field to sign their Dubus books,
which he does.</TE>
<TE>   Ashforth and Mapother, a cousin of Tom Cruise, compare the almost
deceptive simplicity of Dubus' prose to Hemingway's, while the most
astute observation a reporter can muster is "Did you notice how many
times he mentions bacon in his stories?"</TE>
<TE>   At 8, the crowds have gone, though a few fans linger to talk to
the actors. Normally, browsers can count on adventurous and elegant
music in Book Soup. Mose Allison maybe, or Aimee Mann, but tonight,
the sounds of '80s pop queens Paula Abdul Pat Benatar fill the store.
The day has been a long one; maybe the staff is a little punchy. But
it's not time to go home yet.</TE>
<TE>   As on every other night of the year, Book Soup's doors will not
close until midnight.</TE>

<DH>A reluctant first trip to the plastic surgeon brings  her
face to face with an eyelid-opening world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You know," said the man who was just about to cut into my face, "the
older I get, the more I value writers."</LD>
<LD>   I took courage from his words, and I felt something similar toward
him--because the older I get, the more I value cosmetic surgeons.</LD>
<LD>   For many Angelenos, the first trip to the plastic surgeon's office
is simply a rite of passage, like that first martini at the Sky Bar
or the first time contesting a prenup. For a woman who has had
exactly one manicure in her lifetime, who has never had her legs
waxed, who has a hard time remembering to put on lipstick, it was an
excursion into a whole other world.</LD>
<TE>   Just getting to the first appointment was fraught with
misadventure. The doctor who was recommended to me has an office on
Spaulding, and here's how Eastside-located I am: I thought it was
Spaulding Avenue near Midway Hospital, which made sense to me
(doctor=medical procedure=hospital). I spent 20 minutes searching for
an address that did not exist before realizing that it was Spaulding
Place, which lies just a bit west of Barneys in Beverly Hills, which
apparently makes sense to the rest of the world (doctor=improved
appearance =high-end shopping).</TE>
<TE>   Driving down Wilshire Boulevard I realized I had no business going
to a cosmetic surgeon. Yes, I have had a facial scar that has plagued
me with low-grade infections for 12 years now, but I'm Irish
Catholic--we're supposed to grit our teeth and offer our suffering up
to the poor souls in Purgatory, not high-tail it to some medical
Sodom and Gomorrah where faces are peeled, breasts inflated and
botulism is considered a panacea. But by the time I had decided to
turn around, I was there already, and when I found out the doctor
validated parking, well, I took it as a sign from God.</TE>
<TE>   The examining room was small and dull, although a sheaf of
pamphlets promised many wonderful things regarding my breasts, hips
and tummy in such matter-of-fact language that I could see how easy
it would be, if you had the money, to try to tuck and clip your way
to physical perfection. Me, I just wanted this darn scar to stop
getting infected and the doctor said it would be simple
enough--outpatient, local anesthesia only, take about an hour.</TE>
<TE>   According to the American Board of Plastic Surgeons, more than
220,000 Americans had scar revisions last year, making it an even
more popular procedure than breast augmentation (212,500), but
nowhere near as prevalent as liposuction (354,015), eyelid surgery
(327,514) and nose jobs (389,155). There are no local statistics, but
I think we can assume that many of these occur in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   When the big day came, I was nervous on several levels. Signing
the arbitration agreement, I became convinced that there would be an
earthquake just as the doctor was making his first incision and all
the nerves in my face would accidentally be cut and I would go blind.
Then I worried that I would not be satisfied with this procedure,
that soon I would be back requesting fewer wrinkles, a tighter neck,
and a body like Halle Berry's. I'd become one of those women you see
in restaurants who can move about only after dark because their skin
is stretched so tight and thin that any contact with sunlight might
cause it to burst into flame.</TE>
<TE>   What really happened was much less dramatic and much more
interesting. Getting a scar excised is a bit like going to the
dentist, only you have to take all your clothes off and wear a paper
dress. There's the same little prick of the needle to numb the area,
the same blinding bright lights, the same rustle of baby-blue paper
that medical facilities seem to drape over everything. But unlike at
the dentist's, I could talk during the proceedings, a distraction I
was grateful for: Although I couldn't feel any pain, I could feel
that things were being done, things that did not bear thinking about.</TE>
<TE>   So in lieu of contemplation, I chose conversation and learned many
interesting things about the cosmetic surgery industry.</TE>
<TE>   It is, according to my doctor, an economic bellwether--the first
thing to go when times get tough, the last to rebound when things
improve. Last fall, things were very slow, despite the fact that
October and November are usually big months for facial work as folks
prepare for holiday parties and family reunions. The other boom time
is early spring when a young man's, and woman's, thoughts turn to
liposuction. About 35% of patients are men, a number that undoubtedly
would be larger should pec implants ever really catch on.</TE>
<TE>   Although things are a bit sluggish in general, he said, breasts
are back and in a big way--where before most women wanted a B cup,
now they're asking for Cs. Mini-face-lifts, procedures that are less
extensive and have a shorter recovery period, are also gaining
popularity among an increasingly younger clientele, and eyelid
tightening is still very hot. But not as hot as Botox, the
botulism-based wrinkle-tightener that was injected into hundreds of
thousands of Americans last year. Botox injections require regular
visits, which creates a doctor/patient relationship one usually
associates with a general practitioner or an ob/gyn. In fact, during
the recent anthrax scare, my doctor said he received many calls from
patients looking for Cipro prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Why on Earth would someone call a cosmetic surgeon for such a
thing? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the only doctor they see on a regular basis," he answered.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment I simply lay there, loving Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing one's cosmetic surgeon on a social basis is something else
again. At a party or social gathering should this doctor see a
patient, even a patient who has become a friend, he never greets them
until they have been introduced as if for the first time. As he
stitched me up, he recounted one instance of a woman who waved him
over from across the room, and introduced him around, only to have
her boyfriend ask, "And how do you know Dr. X?" The woman stuttered
until the doctor stepped in. "Mutual friends," he said smoothly. Ah,
yes, mutual friends.</TE>
<TE>   And then it was over. I left the office much as I had entered it,
with a small, almost unnoticeable bandage on my forehead. When the
numbness wore off, it hurt quite a bit more than they had indicated,
but having been through childbirth I am accustomed to the Hippocratic
tendency to use "discomfort" as a synonym for "excruciating pain."
Still, I wouldn't rush back just to look a few years younger or a few
pounds thinner.</TE>
<TE>   Although, when you think about it, that might solve a couple of
problems. When the surgeon general called on every citizen to shed 10
pounds, I don't think he ruled out lipo. And forking over another
stack of bills would surely help prove that economic recovery is on
its way. Why, it might just be my duty. Not just as an Angeleno, but
as an American.</TE>

<LD>Artful Reading</LD>
<LD>   Can you read this Learning Link? If so, you know how to do
something that just a few people could do in Europe 500 years ago.
Back then, only wealthy people and church leaders received enough
education to be able to read.</LD>
<LD>   Today, nearly everyone is taught to read in school. There are
other big differences between then and now.</LD>
<TE>   Until the 1500s or so, reading was often done aloud to a group of
people who listened. These days, most people prefer to read alone.
Today, most books are printed on a printing press, and there are
public libraries that lend them to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, all books were made by hand, and many contained
beautiful hand-painted pictures. There were no public libraries--only
church libraries and personal book collections.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the woman in this picture, which is from a book made in
the early 1500s. Do you see how carefully she holds her book? It's a
prayer book with a cloth cover. With care, such a book might last for
hundreds of years.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are many differences between the way people read
hundreds of years ago and today, one thing remains the same: Being
able to read opens a window onto the world.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more, see the "Artful Reading" exhibition at the Getty
(plaza level, North Pavilion) through March 10. The museum invites
children 12 and younger to stop at the information desk to receive a
free bookmark.</TE>
<TE>   For more information or parking reservations, call (310) 440-7300
or visit www.getty.edu. Parking reservations are not needed Saturdays
and Sundays or after 4 p.m. weekdays.</TE>

<HD>First Pets Often Go From the White House to the Dog House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- When Buddy Clinton lost his job as image booster for a
scandalized master, his status plunged from that of presidential best
friend to political has-been. In four short years he careened from
national canine icon to another New York traffic statistic.</LD>
<LD>   The arc of Buddy's brief but famed existence--he was run over by
an SUV last week outside his home in suburban Chappaqua, N.Y.--is a
window into the little-known hardships of a first pet, and a lesson
in the social cruelties of Washington.</LD>
<LD>   In this town, nothing is forgotten faster than a top dog whose
time is up. The phones stop ringing, the treats run out and nobody
wants to play with you anymore. Ask any former congressman.</LD>
<TE>   That is not to say President Clinton did not adore the gangly
chocolate Lab who loved him unconditionally when Hillary and the
world were angry about Monica. But in the stark reality of the
marbled city, presidential pets are ultimately presidential props,
faithful followers who make even the most hard-boiled politician seem
likable. (Which might explain why the White House has been occupied
by only 190 children and more than 400 pets.)</TE>
<TE>   When Herbert Hoover was coming off as aloof in his run for
president, an advisor told him to get a dog. Richard Nixon saved his
political skin when he invoked the name of Checkers while denying he
held a secret slush fund. And when Republicans berated FDR for
dispatching a destroyer to retrieve his beloved Fala from the
Aleutian Islands, the president charged them with picking on his
"little dog" and, perhaps not coincidentally, won an unprecedented
fourth term.</TE>
<TE>   But for the pets, history tells us, it isn't all pampered glory.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, a presidential dog requires a bladder of steel. You
can't just open the back door in the middle of the night at the White
House, and it's a long way from the residence to the ground floor.
(Such was the bane of President Ford's golden retriever, Liberty, who
evidently had highly efficient kidneys.) And when you finally get
outside, the caretakers are forever patching the lush lawn, so forget
about visiting your favorite grassy spot.</TE>
<TE>   Few families are as famously fond of their pets as the Bushes, who
dote on their Scottish terrier Barney and also seem to be working on
a multi-generational dog dynasty. (The late Millie, owned by Bush I,
is mother to the current Spot, owned by Bush II.)</TE>
<TE>   Presidential historian William Seale says the Bushes "are really
dog people."</TE>
<TE>   Which begs the question: Are they cat people?</TE>
<TE>   It seemed so when candidate George W. Bush deserted New Hampshire
for Texas, saying he missed his cat, Ernie. After the election,
though, the six-toed furniture-scratcher was fobbed off on a family
friend in Brentwood and promptly disappeared for three weeks. He was
found wandering with burrs in his fur along Avenue of the Stars in
Century City.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, felines did not fare well in the last White House
transition. Socks, treasured paparazzi fodder in Clinton's first
term, was unloaded on presidential secretary Betty Currie when the
former president moved to New York. Said cause: a blood feud with
Buddy.</TE>
<TE>   While this failed to astonish Columbia University historian Henry
Graff--"In the old days guys would give away a beloved fraternity
ring. Why can't you give away a cat?"--it flabbergasted members of
the American Cat Fanciers Assn. in Branson, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   "No, never!"  said associate director Cindy Skeen when asked if
she would similarly part with her Bootsie.</TE>
<TE>   For all the generations of presidents who have recognized the
image value of a four-footer, they've also proved more than willing
to show the door to one that's outlived its usefulness.</TE>
<TE>   Warren G. Harding's Airedale terrier, Laddie Boy, had his own
chair to sit on at Cabinet meetings and is famously pictured peering
through a wreath at his master's casket. After the funeral, though,
Florence Harding gave the dog away.</TE>
<TE>   President Eisenhower's Weimaraner, Heidi, left unsightly paw marks
on the deep-piled executive rugs, upsetting Mamie, who would send her
in a chauffeured limousine to the family farm in Gettysburg.
Discovering his faithful companion missing, Ike would order her
brought back, causing Heidi to spend an inordinate amount of time on
Highway 15. When the dog took to relieving herself on the Blue Room
rug, she was dispatched to the farm permanently.</TE>
<TE>   While it lasts, though, the time spent in the warmth of
presidential glory can be grand, and creatures great and small have
called the White House home. Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances, had a
menagerie of  30-odd pets, including a monkey. (Small wonder. He was
48; she was 21.)</TE>
<TE>   John Quincy Adams had an alligator and silkworms. Abe Lincoln had
the original Fido. Calvin Coolidge kept a pygmy hippo. Teddy
Roosevelt owned a veritable zoo, including a bull terrier named Pete
that was allegedly expelled from the White House after he tore the
French ambassador's pants. Fala the Scottish terrier went everywhere
with FDR and is said to have starred in a Hollywood movie.</TE>
<TE>   But fame also has its painful flip side. Zachary Taylor's horse
Old Whitey, who carried the former general into battle, was tethered
in retirement on the White House lawn. Souvenir hunters plucked his
tail bald, however, and he was forced to wear a fake one at his
master's funeral, according to historian Seale.</TE>
<TE>   As for Buddy, he sat in on Oval Office meetings where Cabinet
secretaries vied for his affections and some of the world' most
powerful people threw his tennis ball. When Clinton was in a surly
mood, aides would coax Buddy to his side, knowing the affectionate
pup could always cheer him.</TE>
<TE>   But the high life ended with the Clinton presidency. Buddy moved
to Chappaqua,  where he was just another puppy with a past. Clinton,
too young to retire, traveled an average of twice a week, while Buddy
stayed with a valet. He was playfully chasing a contractor when he
was killed; the Clintons were vacationing in Acapulco. Clinton was
said to be devastated.</TE>
<TE>   "The president and Buddy were inseparable," Clinton spokeswoman
Julia Payne said. "Buddy was happiest when he was with his daddy."</TE>
<TE>   As the former president works to enhance his tarnished legacy with
his  efforts on the Clinton library, Buddy, at least in spirit, will
remain by his side. He was memorialized there last week.</TE>

<HD>Leading Them From Temptation?</HD>
<DH>Ministers deliver a prayer-not-porn message at an adult
trade show in Sin City.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Amid the strippers slipping out of their shirts and the sex-toy
makers hawking the latest products at the AVN adult trade show, two
youth ministers from Southern California stand in front of their own
show booth, preaching to the crowd.</LD>
<LD>   For Mike Foster and Craig Gross, who recently launched a Web site
devoted to getting people out of the porn industry and stopping
Internet porn addiction, the mission is clear. They have ventured
into Sin City, diving deep into a conference that revels in explicit
sexuality, to convince a multibillion-dollar industry that Jesus is
far more compelling than the miles of glistening bare skin inside the
Sands Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   "If Jesus were walking the Earth today, we think that he'd be here
too," says Gross, 26, who lives in Mission Viejo. "After all, [he]
hung out with prostitutes and stuff."</LD>
<TE>   Talk about a challenge. The two say they routinely work at various
ministries to try to help young people addicted to alcohol and drugs.
They came up with the idea for the site, XXXChurch.com,  after
talking to parishioners and friends and those they minister to about
where they surf the Net.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, stories of people looking for triple-X films and
photographs online began to surface, says Foster, 30, of Corona, who
is on staff at Crossroads Christian Church there.</TE>
<TE>   The XXXChurch site, launched last week, includes a virtual "prayer
wall," which invites people to "pray for your own integrity and
safety on the Internet"; a section on suggestions for meeting others
who also want to avoid watching erotica; an area proposing
alternatives to the adult-film world; and a software program that
tracks Internet users and what Web sites they visit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not here to judge anyone or to picket the show. What good
would that do?" Gross says. "We decided the best thing to do was to
actually be in the show and try to talk to the people in the industry
in a professional and respectful manner and not be confrontational.
The congregation [at Crossroads] told us they'd be praying for us."</TE>
<TE>   The youth ministers--Foster says he was ordained at Summit Church
in Fontana, Gross at East Side Christian Church in Fullerton--are
among several thousand men crammed into the nation's largest annual
triple-X trade show, a four-day run that wrapped up over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   It's a guy's-guy week, when the city teems with businessmen
attending another major convention in town--the Consumer Electronics
Show. For many, the AVN show is a quick, and traditional, side trip.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife would hang me upside down and whip the pants off me if
she knew I was here," says Stephen Carol, a computer salesman from
Texas, who declined to say where he worked. "It wasn't my idea to
come here, honest. It was my friends'."</TE>
<TE>   Hordes of eager men wait in long lines at the convention center to
buy the $25 one-day "fan" passes. Inside, they grab for autographed
posters, check out the latest porn gadgetry and ogle busty
personalities up close and personal.</TE>
<TE>   Two female porn stars walk past the XXXChurch.com booth, smiling
at a nearby line of gawking men. Some of the men are loudly
obnoxious; others silent and barely breathing. The girls' hairdos are
long and lush; they look as if they were poured into dresses more
sheer than water.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, one man's cell phone rings. He answers: "Oh, hi, baby.
I'm meeting my boss for lunch. Yeah, things are going really well.
Nope, nothing interesting to see here. It's really boring."</TE>
<TE>   This is the kind of event most guys don't bring their wives to,
but Foster is among those who have. She's helping out at the booth
and wearing a G-rated rabbit suit. She steps toward the passing crowd
and begins to hand out fliers.</TE>
<TE>   One woman, who performs under the name Staci Stacked, takes the
flier from Foster and begins to read about the venture. Several steps
later, she crumples it and tosses it into the trash.</TE>
<TE>   "For people here to meet their favorite porn star, our site won't
help them," Gross says. "It'll take an act of God to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Though the pornography project is directed by Foster and Gross
independently of Crossroads church, officials there are aware of the
project, and it has the church's blessings, says Jud Wilhite, a
senior associate pastor.</TE>
<TE>   "As a church and as a ministry, it is very near to our hearts to
help people overcome sexual addiction and to help them have healthy
sexual boundaries with other people," says Wilhite. "Obviously, this
ministry is directed right at that and going right into the middle of
that arena, trying to be a light."</TE>
<TE>   The XXXChurch message at the show appears to fall on somewhat
confused ears. To the right of the ministers' booth, a company
advertises explicit Japanese cartoons; to its left, a firm sells gay
S&amp;M films. Gross steps toward one visitor, handing him a flier
promoting the Web site. The man glances at the sheet of paper in
confusion.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you mean, you're the No. 1 Christian porn site?" asks
David Kreller, an executive at a small adult video distribution firm.
"Christians are selling porn?"</TE>
<TE>   Gross calmly explains their nonprofit venture and their hopes to
reach out to addicts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not here to bash pornographers or the adult entertainment
industry," he says. "Look, I'm married, and I still like to look at
beautiful women. That goes against my faith, and it's something I
struggle with."</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas, temptations and surprising contrasts are everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Gross and Foster step away from their booth to wander around the
convention center floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my goodness, I've never seen anything like this," Foster
says. "These are the most beautiful women I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   The two stop at a booth for K-Beech, an adult film production
company. All eyes gaze upon veteran actress Teri Weigel, clad in
white stockings, a pink thong and little else. The actress blows
kisses to her adoring audience and steps up to the side of a stage.</TE>
<TE>   Away from prying eyes, outside the gaze of Foster and Gross,
Weigel blesses herself, making the sign of the cross. She bows her
head and, for a moment, prays.</TE>
<TE>   "I say the rosary three times a week," Weigel says. "I believe in
prayer and in God. It's made me a better person." Weigel finishes her
prayer, crosses herself again and climbs up a ladder to begin her
striptease.</TE>

<LD>The small, black dog limped slowly down the dusty road. As he walked,
something clinked on his collar. Clink. Clink. Clink. He didn't
notice the sound.</LD>
<LD>   He was tired and hungry and lost. Suddenly he smelled food. Fried
chicken? Beef stew? Spaghetti? He liked everything. The dog hurried
on sore feet toward the smell of food coming from the big yellow
house.</LD>
<LD>   Two boys were playing catch in the frontyard.</LD>
<TE>   "Look at that ratty dog," the bigger kid said.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller kid whistled.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't do that, Max," his brother yelled. "Maybe he's mean."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only going to give him some water," Max answered. "He can't
bite me when he's drinking."</TE>
<TE>   The dog drank all the water in the bowl.</TE>

a clinking sound."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's a medal for bravery," Chad laughed. "He followed you."</TE>
<TE>   "You're not as funny as you look," Max said. He ran inside and
came back with some food scraps in another bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The dog gulped down every bit and wagged his tail before he lay
down in the grass.</TE>
<TE>   "Max, what does it say on the dog's medal?"</TE>
<TE>   Max bent down for a closer look. "It isn't a medal. It's a key."</TE>

bed for him in the garage?" Max hurried on. "Maybe we can find out
where he belongs in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   They piled some old blankets together, then filled the water bowl
again. After supper, they put more food scraps in a dish.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The home of Mickey Mouse finds itself stirring controversy among some
animal rights activists for its new film "Snow Dogs," which opens
Friday. The $33-million Disney movie, which stars Oscar-winning actor
Cuba Gooding Jr., has raised the ire of the Sled Dog Action
Coalition.</LD>
<LD>   Billed by the studio as a light comedy, it's about a Miami dentist
(Gooding) who travels to Alaska to claim an inheritance, only to find
out it includes a pack of sled dogs. Eventually, he learns to mush
and leads his team of dogs to victory in a race.</LD>
<LD>   But animal rights activists are not laughing. The coalition, which
is based in Miami, says the movie glorifies a cruel sport. "Contrary
to Disney's portrayal, the Iditarod [the best-known dog sled race in
the world] does not celebrate the bond between man and dog,"
according to a statement released by the coalition. "Documentation of
the race's history clearly demonstrates a pattern of dog deaths,
injuries and many repeated instances of mushers harming their dogs
for the sake of profit."</LD>
<TE>   The coalition director, Margery Glickman, says the group does not
intend to boycott the film but would like to increase public
awareness about dog sledding.</TE>
<TE>   "Children will see this film and they will think that the dogs
love to race and they are well-treated," Glickman said. "It will be
perpetuating the myth that this grueling Iditarod race is something
wonderful when it is not."</TE>
<TE>   Studio officials say the PG-rated film does not condone the
harming of animals. "The race is not called the Iditarod [in the
film]. The focus of the film is the story of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s
character," said Disney spokeswoman Andrea Marozas. The dog sled
racing is "one element of the film," she noted, adding: "It's a
family comedy, not a documentary."</TE>

<HD>Happy Birthday to Muhammad Ali</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, television producer George Schlatter put together a
television special honoring legendary boxer Muhammad Ali on his 50th
birthday. Schlatter is now climbing back into the TV ring with Ali
for a new CBS special, "Muhammad Ali's 60th Birthday Celebration."</LD>
<LD>   The program, whose guests will include Will Smith, Samuel L.
Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Anthony Hopkins and Sidney Poitier, is the
latest in a frenzied series of recent activities surrounding the
boxer.</LD>
<LD>   "When I did the special before, I felt it was time for the country
to be reminded what Ali stood for," Schlatter said. "It's now time to
do it again. Until Sept. 11, there were not a lot of heroes. But Ali
has been a hero for 40 years. He stood for justice and religion, and
he never wavered. And he may be afflicted with Parkinson's disease,
but his mind is as sharp as ever."</LD>
<TE>   The one-hour special, which airs Wednesday at 9 p.m., was taped
Saturday at the new Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, the new site of the
Academy Awards. The day before, Ali was given a star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame--only he had it placed on the wall of the Kodak Theatre
instead of the sidewalk because "I didn't want anybody walking on
it."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the appearance of Smith, who portrays the boxer in the
movie "Ali," the program will feature Mariah Carey singing "Happy
Birthday" and musical performances by Paul Simon and Martina McBride.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Moviegoers weary of pre-Oscar seriousness escaped to "Orange County"
over the weekend, but the teen comedy couldn't quite match the
struggles of a hobbit and a mathematician at the box office.</LD>
<LD>   "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" was in first
place for the fourth weekend in a row, grossing $16.2 million and
pushing its total take to $228.3 million, according to studio
estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "A Beautiful Mind," which stars Russell Crowe in the true story of
a schizophrenic math genius, expanded to wide release last weekend
and held its second-place spot with $15.8 million over the weekend
for a total of $59 million.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast to those Oscar contenders was "Orange County," which
stars Tom Hanks' son, Colin Hanks, as a student who goes to wild
extremes to get into Stanford. The film opened with $15.1 million
over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "'Orange County' certainly capitalized on a marketplace long on
Oscar contenders and short on outrageous comedies," said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations.
"It came into a pretty serious marketplace and shook it up."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hanks, "Orange County" showcases industry progeny Schuyler
Fisk (Sissy Spacek's daughter) and Jake Kasdan (son of director
Lawrence Kasdan, whose credits include "The Big Chill").</TE>
<TE>   Fisk plays the girlfriend of Hanks' character and Jake Kasdan
directed the film. The main character's  dope-addled brother is
played by Jack Black, who recently starred with Gwyneth Paltrow in
"Shallow Hal."</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased with it. It's on the high end of our
expectations," said Paramount Distribution President Wayne Lewellen.
"Obviously the appeal is to the younger teenage audience."</TE>
<TE>   "A Beautiful Mind," which added 369 new theaters over the weekend,
showed impressive staying power, falling just 5% from its take last
weekend. "Lord of the Rings," in contrast, dropped 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Overall the weekend's top 12 films grossed an estimated $89.9
million, down 14% from last weekend and down 28% from the same
weekend last year, when "Save the Last Dance" and "Cast Away" topped
the box office. However, the same weekend last year was the Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The King holiday comes next weekend, which should contribute to
another solid round of numbers, Dergarabedian said. "Black Hawk
Down," Ridley Scott's combat story about the failed U.S. military
sortie in Somalia in 1993, will be expanding into wide release. The
big new release is Disney's "Snow Dogs," with Cuba Gooding Jr. as a
Miami dentist who inherits a team of  sled dogs in Alaska. "There's a
lot out there. There's a lot of movies that people want to see,"
Dergarabedian said. "It seems to me to be a very strong January."</TE>

<HD>Exposing an Opera's Emotional Core</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of the actual "making" of an opera doesn't make for very
exciting footage. It's all about one guy, or maybe two, sitting at a
desk or piano. So if you're going to make a documentary, you've got
to open things up.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, that's what the makers of "And Then One Night: The
Making of 'Dead Man Walking,'" airing tonight at 10 p.m. on KCET-TV,
have done. Directed and produced by Linda Schaller for San Francisco
PBS station KQED, with narration by actress Angela Bassett, this
one-hour documentary not only traces the creation of a new American
opera, but also explores the emotional conflicts at the core of the
piece itself and, by extension, the debate over capital punishment.
The result is a moving and well-paced program that suggests the
impact a contemporary opera can have--and which this one certainly
did on its electric opening night--but which rarely translates well
to the small screen. In short, it does its subject justice.</LD>
<LD>   "Dead Man Walking" premiered at San Francisco Opera on Oct. 7,
2000, and proved a major opera world event, attracting more
mainstream publicity (and celebrities) than typically attend a new
opera. The story of how that came to pass is nicely told by footage
from an early workshop of the opera, various singing, staging and
technical rehearsals, and scenes from the production itself.</LD>
<TE>   "And Then One Night" also relies heavily on interviews with the
creative principals, including composer Jake Heggie, librettist
Terrence McNally, conductor Patrick Summers, director Joe Mantello,
cast members Susan Graham, Frederica von Stade, John Packard, Robert
Orth and others, designers Michael Yeargan, Sam Fleming and Jennifer
Tipton, and former San Francisco Opera general director Lotfi
Mansouri, who commissioned the piece.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers come to the project somewhat late--the commission
was announced in March 1998--and consequently focus on the final year
of the creative process. Still, they suggest the key artistic issues
and preparatory work involved, without shying away from the opera's
more confrontational and difficult moments. The scene in which
convicted killer Joe De Rocher (baritone Packard) is executed by
injection, for example, is shown nearly in full, and left arrestingly
silent, as it was in the production.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond this, "And Then One Night" also includes interviews with
Sister Helen Prejean, on whose book the opera is based and whose
account also inspired the earlier Hollywood movie of the same name,
as well as with other people not ostensibly involved with the
production, including family members of both victims and death row
criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the emotional core of "Dead Man Walking" resonates from
the victims' parents, who are given some of Heggie's most affecting
music and McNally's most incisive writing. Schaller gives these
scenes a great deal of attention, and that supports what Heggie and
McNally have to say about their creative strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, no documentary about the making of an opera can
approach the impact of the work itself. But "And Then One Night"
gives you a credible feel for what "Dead Man Walking" is about, and
that in itself is a service to the art form, its public and the
potentially greater audience new American opera must find if it is
ever to thrive.</TE>

<LD>If the "written by" credit on "Monday Night Mayhem" looks familiar to
avid followers of the  TV industry, that's because the Bill Carter
listed is the same one  who covers television for the New York Times.</LD>
<LD>   Carter coauthored the 1989 book on which the film is based with
Fortune magazine's Marc Gunther and, after selling the movie rights,
agreed to write the screenplay. Carter did the same on "The Late
Shift," the 1996 Home Box Office movie about the David Letterman-Jay
Leno duel to succeed Johnny Carson, also based on his book.</LD>
<LD>   It is generally a matter of policy for newspapers not to let
reporters enter into business relationships with companies they might
cover, though such entanglements have become more difficult to avoid
as media companies have grown.</LD>
<TE>   A New York Times spokesman said Carter received no payment from

avoided any conflict of interest," the spokesman said. Carter
recused himself from reporting on TNT while the movie was in

<LD>For someone with a reputation as a deadpan singer, Brett Sparks was a
howling, growling aggressor at Spaceland on Friday, chewing up and
spitting out the lyrics written by his wife, Rennie, like chaws of
tobacco.</LD>
<LD>   As the Handsome Family, this couple has staked out a distinctive
patch in the folk-country wing of the indie-rock world, turning out
five albums packed with haunting, enigmatic songs. Rennie writes
verses commingling beauty and dread, and Brett sets them to music
steeped in classic folk and country.</LD>
<LD>   Though they produced all this work in their longtime home of
Chicago (which they recently left), they have their backwoods vibe
down pat. At Spaceland they came on as a Ma and Pa Kettle with
graduate degrees in music and literature, bantering amiably between
tunes and deploying minimalist instrumentation--Brett's electric and
acoustic guitars, Rennie's bass and keyboard and autoharp, and some
fill-in-the-blanks arrangements.</LD>
<TE>   While they joked about the slowness of their tempos, the
performances added an energy and edge to the songs. But the focus was
on the lyrics, and Brett's deep, insistent singing was always
absorbing, keeping the crowd rapt at Rennie's sad tales of extinct
birds, drunken tantrums and troubled souls.</TE>

<HD>Classic Stylings From Ernie Andrews</HD>
<DH>Backed by the Los Angeles Symphonic Camerata, the bluesman
shows impressive range.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernie Andrews is one of a kind--a jazz original whose utterly
idiosyncratic singing style has never fully received the attention it
warrants. So it was especially pleasurable Saturday night to hear him
at Cal State L.A.'s Luckman Fine Arts Complex with the Los Angeles
Symphonic Camerata.</LD>
<LD>   At 74, Andrews comes from a generation of artists who were raised
with the notion that performing with a string orchestra or a symphony
somehow provided ultimate certification of their art. Happily, that
notion, although not completely gone, has lost much of its impact.
Still, given its importance to Andrews, it was touching to hear
him--halfway through the evening--turn to conductor David Buck and
the members of the Camerata and earnestly thank them for providing
what he described as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   From a listener's point of view, he made the most of it, ranging
across a selection of material reaching far beyond the blues songs
that have been his most  familiar musical staple. In each case,
however, he quickly molded the tune to his own jaunty style, striding
the stage in magisterial fashion, strutting in his own imitable
manner, waving his arms for dramatic emphasis. The results were
always intriguing: a virtual rewrite of James Taylor's "Fire and
Rain," an oddly upbeat rendering of "It Must Have Been Something I
Dreamed Last Night," a different slant on Kander and Webb's "Maybe
This Time" and a decidedly non-Sinatra version of "My Way."</TE>
<TE>   Andrews wisely devoted a substantial portion of the evening to his
trademark blues style, offering his own whimsical impressions of
Jimmy Rushing, Ivy Anderson and Al Hibbler, among others, in a
hard-swinging romp through "Going to Kansas City." And he was
superbly supported by the rhythm trio of pianist Art Hillary, bassist
Richard Simon, drummer Frank Wilson and the always compelling tenor
saxophone of Herman Riley, with occasional solo contributions from
trombonist/violinist Dan Weinstein and violinists Lesa Terry and
Yvette Devereaux.</TE>

<HD>Brubeck Serves as a Shining Light at Music Education
Conference</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was probably appropriate that a performance by the Dave Brubeck
Quartet was the   climax of the International Assn. for Jazz
Education's 29th annual conference  Friday night at the Long Beach
Convention Center's Terrace Theater. The veteran composer-pianist has
long been a shining example of the impact an academic education can
have. And, when he came to prominence in the '50s, it was primarily
via his great popularity with university audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the fact that he has been leading a similarly instrumented
ensemble--alto saxophone, bass, drums and his own piano--for nearly
half a century, Brubeck's performances have never drifted into
and-then-I-wrote predictability.</LD>
<LD>   Working before a packed house of knowledgeable jazz fans with
saxophonist Bobby Militello, bassist Michael Moore and drummer Randy
Jones, he seemed even more willing to push the musical envelope.</LD>
<TE>   He would not have been allowed to leave the hall, of course,
without playing Paul Desmond's "Take Five." And both he and, in
particular, drummer Jones seemed to take great pleasure in parsing
the 5/4 meter into every imaginable rhythmic permutation.</TE>
<TE>   But there also were more quietly introspective moments. Brubeck's
soloing on "In Your Own Sweet Way," for example, displayed his
capacity for great harmonic subtlety, often using only a few notes to
imply great harmonic layering.</TE>
<TE>   And a selection from his new recording, "The Crossing,"
underscored the fact that, at 81, his compositional juices are still
flowing freely.</TE>
<TE>   Other high-visibility performers on the Friday night  schedule
included saxophonist Steve Wilson's quartet, the Rodney Jones Soul
Manifesto and Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra with singer Dee Dee
Bridgewater.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a lovely duet appearance by vibist Gary Burton and
pianist Makoto Ozone, whose precise styles made for an unusually
creative fit.</TE>
<TE>   As with other aspects of the conference, however, many of the
intriguing moments were generated by less-visible artists.</TE>
<TE>   The first segment of Friday's concert, for example, was dedicated
to appearances by two young ensembles: The IAJE and NFAA Clifford
Brown/Stan Getz Fellowship Recipients Quintet and the  IAJE/BET
Jazz-Sisters In Jazz Collegiate Quintet, both filled with talented
young artists well on their way to professional careers.</TE>
<TE>   In other locations, highlight performances were offered by the
thorny Either/Orchestra, the hard-driving New Jazz Composers Octet,
pianist Lynne Arriale's blend of flowing lyricism and subtle
harmonies, fluegelhornist Ingrid Jensen's superb playing with the
Virginia Mayhew Group and the richly orchestrated sounds of the Kim
Richmond Concert Jazz Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   For the jazz aficionado, one of the most remarkable aspects of the
IAJE gatherings is the awareness of being surrounded by literally
thousands of others who--despite individual stylistic
preferences--also care enough about the music to join the
organization and attend the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a few small but fascinating examples: overhearing a
discussion on a hotel elevator regarding some of the more complex
aspects of John Coltrane's improvisation; walking behind someone who
is casually whistling the line of a Charlie Parker solo; watching
youthful audience members, young enough to be the grandchildren of
Dave Brubeck's first collegiate fans, enthusiastically cheering the
legendary artist's performance.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, as well as during the other festival evenings, the
musical events spilled beyond the Convention Center to the Westin
Long Beach Hotel, which ran its own schedule of jazz events in two
rooms--the Lobby Grill and the Ocean Ballroom--for a good six hours
or so every evening, with no cover charge. The lineup of artists was
extensive and impressive, including singers Mary Stallings, Kate
McGarry, Kendra Shank, Mark Murphy and Barbara Sfraga, and ensembles
led by Terry Trotter, James Williams, Bill Cunliffe and the Banda
Brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, although the conference ended on Saturday, the Westin
Long Beach continues its jazz events--currently only on Thursday
nights but perhaps, with this week's impetus, soon expanding to other
dates.</TE>
<TE>   The conference wrapped on Saturday night with scheduled
performances by the Al Di Meola World Sinfonia, the WDR Big Band
tribute to Joe Zawinul, local favorites Poncho Sanchez and Joey
DeFrancesco, and a jazz oratorio by Dr. Willis Kirk. By almost any
standard it was a success--the third most heavily attended conference
in the series. In retrospect, amid all the seminars, panels and
concerts, the events that remain most memorable are the jams, the
spontaneous get-togethers--especially a marvelously spirited Latin
jazz session on Friday night--in which the central essence of jazz,
its incomparable inner community, was in full blossom.</TE>

<HD>Blind Boys of Alabama Share Gospel With Grace, Joy</HD>
<DH>The adventurous group, led by Clarence Fountain, brings
passion and dedication to a spirited concert at Royce Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Blind Boys of Alabama leader Clarence Fountain had taken a
different path in music, he might be one of our great blues or soul
singers. His most compelling vocals recall the growling urgency of
Howlin' Wolf and the soulful grace of Solomon Burke.</LD>
<LD>   But you understand why Fountain, who is in his early 70s, has
stuck with gospel music for all these years--and why we are better
off for it--after his concert with the Blind Boys on Saturday at
UCLA's Royce Hall.</LD>
<LD>   He's driven by a passion for gospel that enables him to preserve
its high-spirited tradition, yet he challenges gospel purists by
incorporating elements of pop, rock and blues into his music.</LD>
<TE>   The quintet's most adventurous experiment was last year's "Spirit
of the Century," a striking album released by Peter Gabriel's Real
World label and nominated for a Grammy in the traditional soul gospel
category.</TE>
<TE>   With producer John Chelew, the Blind Boys--whose history dates
back to before World War II and who gained attention in the 1980s for
their role in the hit musical "The Gospel at Colonus"--forge a daring
blues-gospel synthesis in the album. It balances traditional fare,
such as "Nobody's Fault but Mine," with songs by Tom Waits, Ben
Harper and, most surprisingly, the Rolling Stones ("Just Want to See
His Face" from "Exile on Main Street").</TE>
<TE>   The Blind Boys (minus ailing member George Scott) performed most
of the album Saturday, backed by the record's all-star cast:
guitarists David Lindley and John Hammond, harmonica player Charles
Musselwhite, bassist Danny Thompson and drummer Michael Jerome.</TE>
<TE>   Their version of Waits' "Way Down in the Hole," a warning about
keeping Satan at bay, didn't fully ignite because the arrangement
leaned too much on the song's blues component. The interpretation of
Harper's "Give a Man a Home," however, was a spectacular mix of
styles that turned the song about social responsibility into an
inspiring, foot-stomping gospel-soul workout.</TE>
<TE>   Even more daring was a juxtaposition of the sacred and the
secular: the lyrics of "Amazing Grace," that tender and durable
gospel tune, with a bluesy version of "House of the Rising Sun," the
classic folk song set in a New Orleans brothel.</TE>
<TE>   The move could have felt gimmicky, but it was done with such
dedication and grace that it served as a thoughtful and moving
expression of sin and redemption.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fountain isn't the only marvel in the group. Jimmy Carter, another
vintage member, is a born showman with a sweeter, more pure gospel
voice than the gritty Fountain. Carter made a series of rapid spins
during one song that would have been impressive under any
circumstances, but bordered on electrifying given his age and his
blindness.</TE>
<TE>   In another joyous segment, Carter, with an aide to help guide him,
created a sense of heightened community in the auditorium by moving
through the aisles, shaking hands with fans and urging everyone to
jump and shout along with him.</TE>
<TE>   The Blind Boys, backed by their own band, leaned toward more
standard gospel offerings in the concert's second half, closing with
a haunting and thoughtful version of the tense "The Last Time." The
song has much of the dramatic punch of the Rolling Stones' song of
the same name, but it is a traditional number that has been part of
the Blind Boys' repertoire since at least the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   In the song's key line, Fountain, who performed most of the show
seated, declared over and over that this night could be the last time
we all sing together--addressing the sadness of death while
celebrating faith in life eternal.</TE>
<TE>   The song's captivating balance of competing emotions reminds us
why gospel music has been such a powerful force over the years--and
why it remains so in the capable hands of the Blind Boys of Alabama.</TE>

<HD>British Bands Live Up to the Hype</HD>
<DH>Charlatans UK and Starsailor redefine their respective eras
in the English rock scene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Charlatans UK were part of a much-hyped English rock scene of the
past. Starsailor is at the forefront of a hyped English scene today.
At the Palace on Friday, each band not only represented its era
commendably, but also transcended it with classic rock values and
personable artistic integrity.</LD>
<LD>   The headlining Charlatans' singer Tim Burgess cut a benignly
roguish figure on stage with an Oliver Twist cap and amiably
shambling manner. The image underscored echoes of Rod Stewart and
Mick Jagger (and occasional hints of Bob Dylan) in his singing, with
the band's solid playing bringing out the Faces and Stones elements
in the songs.</LD>
<LD>   But never was the evening given to nostalgia. Such songs as the
opening "Love Is the Key" from last year's "Wonderland" album didn't
have quite the youthful charge of the 1990 semi-hit "The Only One I
Know," but it was more than compensated by a balance of maturity and
confidence.</LD>
<TE>   In the course of two hours Friday, the Charlatans displayed depth
that eluded Happy Mondays and Primal Scream--two bands that
overshadowed them in hometown Manchester's circa 1990, drug-fueled
"Madchester" scene--and a range lacking in that city's best-known
band of recent years, Oasis. Most significantly, after more than a
decade of grinding it out, after the death of founding keyboardist
Rob Collins in 1997 and after recently being dropped by MCA Records
in the U.S., Burgess (now an L.A. resident) still brings a sense of
joy to the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Joy was also a key in Starsailor's opening set, though a more
innocent brand. Having only played a few small U.S. clubs before
this, the quartet was bursting with enthusiasm to match the youthful
promise of singer James Walsh's poetically inclined anthems and
elastic vocals.</TE>
<TE>   Turning up the rock power, the band stepped up impressively to the
bigger venue scale, adding dynamic punch to the music and confirming
its spot alongside such other U.K. arrivals as Coldplay, Travis and
Elbow as a band to watch.</TE>

<LD>Television has seen original sports movies galore in recent years,
from HBO's dark and funny "Don King: Only in America" to ABC's dim
account of Billy Jean King versus Bobby Riggs, an absurd scenario
that claimed her camera-tailored tennis win over this aging grifter
somehow emboldened contemporary feminism.</LD>
<LD>   Coming in March is a Starz movie about the Joe Louis-Max Schmeling
boxing rivalry that turned friendly and "A Season on the Brink,"
ESPN's version of John Feinstein's book about the 1985-86 Indiana
University basketball team and its volcanic coach, Bobby Knight.</LD>
<LD>   The book was said to be unpopular with Knight, who has since moved
on to Texas Tech after being expelled from Hoosierdom following one
explosion too many. The actor playing him, Brian Dennehy, proclaims
himself Knight's "huge fan," however, and promises a "fair statement"
on this polarizing sports figure.</LD>
<TE>   Well, ESPN is nothing if not ... fair?</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, tonight brings TNT's often entertaining "Monday Night
Mayhem," recalling Roone Arledge's goofy idea about a prime-time home
for the NFL on ABC. And a broadcast booth inhabited by a trio of
personalities, two of whom--urban extraterrestrial Howard Cosell and
Mr. Aw-Shucks himself, Dandy Don Meredith--would turn out to be Curly
and Moe.</TE>
<TE>   Was Arledge, who was then ABC Sports president, crazy? Yes, crazy
like a visionary, one whose risky concept, developed in conjunction
with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, would give then-floundering ABC a
bold new signature en route to becoming the most enduring franchise
in prime-time history. And 311/2 years after the mayhem began,
"Monday Night Football" is still puttering along with a threesome in
the booth that includes a comic doing jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "The presentation is gonna be everything," Arledge (John Heard)
says prophetically in the movie, although having good games to
telecast is also beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   There's a lot here about network jealousies, with NBC getting ever
edgy about the huge early success of "Monday Night Football," which
sat Keith Jackson beside Cosell and Meredith its first season before
Arledge turned to vanilla Frank Gifford.</TE>
<TE>   "Monday Night Football" fanatics should have great fun with this.
Many of the storied squabbles and idiosyncrasies are covered here:
Gifford (Kevin Anderson) stumbling over players' names, Meredith
(Brad Beyer) tiring of playing Dandy Don, Arledge refusing to return
calls, and director Chet Forte (Nicholas Turturro) favoring shots of
female cleavage, and impaling himself on his gambling addiction.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, though, this becomes less about them, and even about
the show that made some of them fleeting media stars, than about the
strongest personality and only indelible member of the group, the
auteur of public insults and diatribes who enraged nearly all of them
at one time or another.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's Cosell (John Turturro), brilliant, magnetic and
even courageous, but also insufferable, self-serving and, at times,
as phony as his pancake of hair. He was sportscasting's hybrid of
eloquence and bombast, good cop/bad cop rolled into one.</TE>
<TE>   As the movie does gradually tilt darkly his way, it becomes as
wearisome as Cosell himself ultimately became when growing
increasingly bitter and alienated, his self-puffery and craving for
work with more "gravity"--including anchoring the evening
news--becoming impossible to contain.</TE>
<TE>   It's a dissent into isolation and paranoia that Turturro captures
ably while walking one of those fine lines separating credible acting
from caricature. He's mastered Cosellspeak and the physical
mannerisms, including Cosell's habit of draping his arm around the
shoulders of the person beside him. Compare Turturro's work here with
Fred Willard's in "When Billy Beat Bobby," and you'll see just how
buffoonish a Cosell depiction can be.</TE>
<TE>   Although gifted in many ways, Cosell himself would become a self
parody. He clearly didn't understand his limitations, affirmed by his
ill-fated variety show (he even sang on one telecast) and other TV
adventures with entertainers in which he became a willing shill for
celebrityhood. And unmentioned in this movie is how this
self-proclaimed champion of ethical sports journalism fawned over the
ABC stars that Arledge shamelessly marched into the booth on Monday
nights to advertise the network's prime-time schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's source is the "Monday Night Mayhem" book by Marc Gunther
and Bill Carter. TNT's script was also written by Carter, a New York
Times reporter whose later book, "The Late Shift," was the basis for
an HBO movie about Jay Leno and David Letterman competing for Johnny
Carson's throne on NBC's "Tonight Show."</TE>
<TE>   Heading "Monday Night Mayhem" director Ernest Dickerson's credits
is "Strange Justice," a balanced and stylishly creative Showtime
account of Anita Hill versus Clarence Thomas that earned a Peabody
Award.</TE>
<TE>   None of this validates "Monday Night Mayhem," some of which is
"fictionalized for dramatic purposes," its ending disclaimer notes.
As if, when watching several scenes that scream out "fantasy," you
would have to be told.</TE>
<TE>   There are some fine ones, as well. One has Cosell and Arledge (the
undersung Heard's excellent work is especially noteworthy) lunching
together quietly until their simmering antagonisms erupt, flaming
into a bonfire of anger and emotion. Another shows Cosell (a New York
Jew who was pelted by anti-Semitic mail) deeply introspective and
sad, telling his beloved wife, Emmy (Patti LuPone), he's "out there
all alone" after being declared a racist because of labeling a
scampering African American running back "a little monkey." In fact,
he had made an innocent generic reference during a game, one that had
been twisted by his enemies and misunderstood by others, the
criticism of him ignoring his famous commitment to civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   The Cosell/Meredith/Gifford team lasted only a few years, the
fabulous on-air chemistry that made them ultimately eating away at
them like acid. First came fissures in the facade, then cracks, then
open rupture. Many others would pass through this Monday night
turnstile in years to come, but none as memorable as these three as a
team or Cosell as an individual.</TE>
<TE>   He appears to have been one of those narcissists who truly
believed the wonderful things he said about himself. Although loving
to display his large vocabulary, there was one word he was never able
to comprehend.</TE>
<TE>   Humility.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Monday Night Mayhem" airs tonight at 9 on TNT. The network has
rated it TV-14-L (may be unsuitable for children younger than 14,
with a special advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Executive Shake-Ups at Center of Showcase</HD>
<DH>Movements at ABC and UPN overshadow previews of new
programming at the semiannual media event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gathering of television critics in Pasadena over the last week to
preview new programming has failed to reveal any over-arching truths
about the country's general mood, as reflected in its TV viewing
habits, since the events of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The semiannual event has, however, provided insight into the
desperate state of the television business, demonstrated by the war
of words and even a pair of dueling lawsuits flung back and forth
among the broadcast networks, which also watched two top programming
executives leave their jobs just days prior to their networks'
scheduled question-and-answer session with reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Network executives have been seemingly hard-pressed to explain how
the frantic nature of their competition in recent months or such
executive tumult benefits the television audience; still, they have
freely admitted that they are scrapping to reach every eyeball they
can as if their lives (or at least careers) depended on it, because,
in fact, that appears to be the case.</LD>
<TE>   So it was that ABC officials spent their day with visiting
reporters and TV critics Sunday not so much promoting their midseason
programs as explaining why the person who supervised development of
them wasn't on hand.</TE>
<TE>   Stu Bloomberg, co-chairman of ABC Television Entertainment Group,
lost his job due to the network's sluggish ratings performance last
week. Susan Lyne--previously ABC's head of movies and miniseries--was
named to succeed him, albeit with the lesser title of president. On
Friday, UPN also confirmed that its chief executive, Dean Valentine,
is leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Such changes have become an almost annual occurrence. NBC enacted
the same scenario a year ago, when Jeff Zucker replaced Garth Ancier
in its top entertainment post, just as Fox Entertainment Group
President Gail Berman was a new arrival six months before that. The
most obvious parallels are between Zucker and Lyne, both former
journalists (Zucker the producer of NBC's "Today" show, Lyne an
editor of Premiere magazine) who will migrate back and forth from New
York to handle their new duties.</TE>
<TE>   ABC Entertainment Television Group Chairman Lloyd Braun, who
survived the shake-up that resulted in Bloomberg's exit, acknowledged
Sunday that ABC is "in the midst of a very disappointing season" and
failed to generate new hits while "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire"--which propelled the network into first place two
seasons ago--was "blazing hot."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Braun suggested that ABC is assembling the building blocks
that could spur a recovery. Among them are the sitcom "My Wife and
Kids" and new series "According to Jim" and "Alias," all of which
have been renewed for next season, ABC announced. Braun also tempered
past comments that cast doubts on "Millionaire's" future, which had
angered host Regis Philbin, saying that ABC is simply trying to
ascertain the most effective way to program the series next season.</TE>
<TE>   Lyne, less than a week into the job, was somewhat circumspect in
her remarks, saying she hopes to attract top talent by creating "an
atmosphere where people can do their best work." She also expressed
ambitions to develop projects that will appeal to a mass audience,
given that ABC has struggled with critically acclaimed shows such as
the since-departed "Sports Night" and current drama "Once and Again,"
whose future Braun declined to discuss.</TE>
<TE>   ABC also fielded several questions second-guessing the network's
decision to pass on a 25th anniversary special commemorating the
network's landmark miniseries "Roots," with the special to play on
NBC this Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't feel creatively what we heard was very strong,"
Braun said in regard to the prime-time special pitched to the
network, saying ABC planned a three-part series on "Good Morning
America" regarding the program. ABC also announced that the network
has ordered a show for this spring featuring comedian George Lopez, a
rare prime-time series featuring a Hispanic lead. All of the
networks, and ABC in particular, have been pressured by interest
groups regarding their levels of minority representation both on air
and in their executive ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps foremost, the press tour has demonstrated the
brass-knuckles tactics networks are using to amass ratings at the
expense of competitors, from NBC's decision to run a Playboy playmate
edition of its stunt show "Fear Factor" opposite Fox's coverage of
the Super Bowl halftime show to the lawsuits over ABC and Fox's
similarly themed quiz shows "The Chair" and "The Chamber,"
respectively. Fox moved to rush its program on the air Sunday with
little promotion to undermine ABC, whose series premieres Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to justify such stunts, Zucker stated last week that NBC was
simply "having fun" with its scheduling ploy, while Braun noted that
the networks are "in a very, very competitive business."</TE>
<TE>   The producers of "The Chair" sued Fox earlier this month, alleging
that they had pitched their series to the network, which bid for the
rights before ordering a similar concept appropriating elements of
the show when it lost out. (Both series feature contestants being
confined and monitored while they answer questions.)</TE>
<TE>   Fox filed a countersuit Friday, denying those claims while
contending that producers of "The Chair" were waging "a campaign"
against their show that included sneaking onto the closed set to
obtain information about the series. The attorney for producers of
"The Chair," Steve Marenberg, called the countersuit "a classic
tactic to obscure the focus of the real dispute, which is that they
appropriated elements of our show."</TE>
<TE>   Few major themes have emerged from the first of these events to
follow the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, though there has been
considerable talk about "comfort food" programming and the hunger for
nostalgia, as evidenced by CBS' ratings success in November with "I
Love Lucy" and "The Carol Burnett Show" specials.</TE>
<TE>   Still, executives struggled to identify a shift in viewing
patterns, as many pundits anticipated, in the wake of those attacks.
However, media-buying firm Initiative Media presented its own study
last week on post-Sept. 11 media trends, which found people to be
more bonded to their favorite shows and exhibiting a heightened
interest in news while gradually drifting back to usual patterns.</TE>
<TE>   "People are seeking closure now. They really want to return to
normal," said Stacey Lynn Koerner, Initiative's senior vice president
and director of audience research.</TE>
<TE>   ABC News' Barbara Walters addressed reporters Sunday, saying she
was "surprised and disappointed" when ABC moved "20/20" out of its
Friday slot in September. The series returns to that night this week,
with correspondent John Miller joining Walters.</TE>

<HD>Region's Major Arts Groups Hold Steady Post-Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Officials say they're better off than counterparts in other
big cities that are more reliant on tourist and corporate dollars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spend enough time in conversation with those who chase donor money
for Southern California's leading cultural institutions, and three
words keep coming up: We expected worse.</LD>
<LD>   In the midst of recession and national calamity, many of this
region's visual and performing arts groups say they've safely scraped
through the most harrowing fund-raising season in memory.</LD>
<LD>   Their income for 2001 may be flat or down slightly, but top
officials say they know of no layoffs at major Southern California
cultural organizations and only a few cancellations in this year's
schedules.</LD>
<TE>   Although arts groups here still face substantial challenges,
leaders agree that this region's troubles are modest compared  with
the crises faced by their counterparts in New York, and milder than
those cropping up in the San Francisco area.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us feels particularly fortunate. But as we
look to colleagues in other cities ... it's quite different," said
Jeremy Strick, director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary
Art.</TE>
<TE>   Like MOCA, most major cultural institutions in this region say
they're either making no programming changes or responding with
delays and detours that audiences will never notice. However, arts
insiders agree that the smallest  organizations and individual
artists may be more vulnerable to financial woes than the larger
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough," said Margie Johnson Reese, general manager of
the city of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. "But I really
don't think it hit rock bottom, as we feared."</TE>
<TE>   An irony, several veteran arts officials said, is that this area's
post-September endurance owes a lot to two circumstances that until
recently looked like weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   One  involves tourism. Because cultural institutions in Los
Angeles depend less on tourist spending than their counterparts in
many other locales, Johnson Reese noted, a decline in travel has had
less effect on museums and theater attendance here than in such
cities as New York, Chicago and San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   Another factor may stem from the declining number of Fortune 500
corporate headquarters in Los Angeles County. Veteran fund-raisers
said that compared  with other major cities, L.A. ranks relatively
low in home-grown corporate support for the arts.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, this area had less to lose when Sept. 11 and the
mounting recession prompted many corporations to slash their arts
grant-giving and advertising budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, local audiences and individual donors, who supply the
lion's share of income to most cultural groups here, have been
largely steadfast.</TE>
<TE>   Though results are still being tallied at most organizations for
the last days of 2001 (when Dec. 31 tax-deduction deadlines inspire
many contributions), several, including the Los Angeles County Museum
of Natural History, the Pasadena Playhouse and the Orange County
Performing Arts Center, say they've seen individual donations
accelerate since Sept. 11, surpassing figures from the year before.
In some cases, those increases may compensate for dips in support
from corporations, foundations and government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The California Arts Council, which makes grants to organizations
statewide, has been targeted for a 7.7% cut in its $32-million annual
budget by Gov. Gray Davis. The Los Angeles Cultural Affairs
Department, which made $5.8 million in grants locally in the last
fiscal year, has been told to tentatively expect a 15% budget cut for
the year beginning in July.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Arts Commission--where this year's pool
of outgoing grant money is expected to match the 2001 total of about
$3 million--executive director Laura Zucker said that in the weeks
after Sept. 11 she considered staging a workshop to help
organizations cope with sudden fund-raising shortfalls. But by the
end of October, she and her colleagues had changed their minds.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't see the evidence that the need was that strong," said
Zucker.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the region, arts leaders make similar reports.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which is relying on contributions
to cover roughly 30% of its $52-million budget this year, managing
director Deborah Borda had confessed to profound worries in the first
weeks following Sept. 11. But last week she said she was "delighted"
with individual contributions in recent months, and that "we're on
target with our [pre-Sept. 11] projections."</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which counts on
government, corporate, foundation and individual donations to cover
more than 70% of its $41.8-million annual budget (and where a major
capital campaign looms as officials plan to rebuild the museum
complex), donation numbers are still being crunched. But the museum
says it had 41,390 paying visitors from October through December of
2001--slightly more than in the last quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At the Center Theatre Group, which includes the Ahmanson Theatre
and Mark Taper Forum at the Music Center in downtown Los Angeles,
both individual and corporate donations are on a pace to meet goals
set in July. Of 56 corporations that gave $5,000 or more last year,
officials said, just one has warned of a possible post-Sept. 11
change in direction.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Strick reported
that attendance and individual donations were meeting pre-Sept. 11
projections, but corporate and foundation money has lagged. Strick
said his tentative plan is to pare this fiscal year's budget by 5%,
delaying hires and spending less in areas such as marketing and
exhibition installation.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles Opera, Elizabeth Kennedy, director of
administration, said, "September and October were terrible. But now,
having gotten through the end of December, we seem to be pretty much
where we'd hoped to be."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy did acknowledge that many of the opera's long-term plans
have been delayed by the September attacks and the limping economy,
most notably artistic director Placido Domingo's ambitions to stage
Wagner's "Ring" cycle, an undertaking that could cost the
organization $30 million or more. Opera officials, once aiming to
begin the cycle in 2003, now say 2006 is more likely.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, senior vice
president for advancement Dyan Sublett says that through early
December, fund-raising was up 57% from individuals and up 32% from
corporations--boosts that should neutralize a drop in government
funding and allow the museum to meet its 2001-2002 budget targets.
(Still, individual and corporate donations are a relatively small
share of the museum's overall $30-million budget, which depends most
heavily on government support and earned income.)</TE>
<TE>   At the Pasadena Playhouse, said general manager Brian Colburn,
"[we thought] we might be as much as 30% to 40% off in fund-raising"
as a consequence of Sept. 11.  Instead,  individual contributions and
ticket sales for 2001 wound up narrowly beating 2000 figures. Colburn
said the playhouse's overall income fell short of pre-September
targets but was down less than 10% from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At the Orange County Performing Arts Center, according to vice
president for development Terry Jones, as of Dec. 21 the annual
fund-raising campaign was about $140,000, or 15%, ahead of last year
in gifts from individuals, and overall about $200,000 behind the $2.5
million it had raised by the same point a year before.</TE>
<TE>   And at South Coast Repertory theater, managing director Paula
Tomei said, "Last year we were at almost $1 million [in overall
contributed income from Sept. 1 through December], and this year
we're at almost $1 million, too. We're tracking right where we were
last year."</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego today, the San Diego Symphony is formally announcing
a $100-million donation from Qualcomm Chief Executive Irwin Jacobs,
the largest single gift ever to an American orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, circumstances for arts groups have been dire enough
to inspire a citywide "arts recovery fund." Layoffs and exhibition
cutbacks have been announced at the Guggenheim and Whitney museums.
The Alliance of Resident Theatres/New York (A.R.T./New York),
extrapolating from a post-Sept. 11 survey of 101 of its 400-some
members, projected a 2002 shortfall of $16.3 million, citing
decreased ticket sales, fund-raising and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Francisco area, where  8 cents of every dollar in
hotel-tax revenue goes to the city's arts grants program, limping
tourism has city officials fearing cuts as deep as 25% in next year's
arts grants. The San Jose Symphony and the San Francisco-based
Friends of Photography both closed their doors in October, saying
that the recession and Sept. 11 had exacerbated existing money
troubles.</TE>
<TE>   And there have been some shortfalls in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 27 the Music Theatre of Southern California, a longtime
presenter of musicals and concerts at the San Gabriel Civic
Auditorium, said it would shut down, citing reduced revenues and
donations since Sept. 11. On Jan. 8 the Pasadena Civic Auditorium
Foundation canceled the rest of its Pasadena Civic Musical Series,
scrubbing a schedule of touring-company productions of "Annie Get
Your Gun," "Riverdance" and "My Fair Lady" that would have run
through  April.</TE>
<TE>   Less dramatically, at the UCLA Hammer Museum, which had a goal of
$1.3 million in donated income between July 2001 and June 2002,
development associate Kim Miller said, "I'm hoping we're going to get
two-thirds of the way to our goal." Officials also decided to extend
a $25-million capital campaign to pay for the museum's planned
redesign.</TE>
<TE>   But most administrators describe a relatively stable aftermath
here. Apart from donations, they say, ticket and gift shop sales,
season subscriptions and other earned-income sources have held up
better than many expected.</TE>
<TE>   "When high-end restaurants were suffering, when amusement parks
were down, when jewelry sales were off, people were still coming to
arts events--because we provided meaning for them," said Los
Angeles-based arts consultant Jerry Yoshitomi.</TE>
<TE>   Other delayed effects may turn up as corporations and foundations
retrench further, officials say. Basically, said Zucker of the Los
Angeles County Arts Commission, "the recession has not yet really hit
the arts community. This next year is going to be a very telling
time."</TE>

<LD>"Great books are wine," America's great author-lecturer Mark Twain
once said. "My books are water." Then he added, "But everybody drinks
water."</LD>
<LD>   And sounding like an early Groucho Marx, who would never join a
club that would have him as a member, he once said he "wouldn't have
a girl that I was worthy of. She wouldn't do. She wouldn't be
respectable enough."</LD>
<LD>   He commanded the stage as he did the written page, and if he were
alive today, Leno and Letterman would have him on.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, there's more effortless wit in an evening or two of Twain
than in all of prime time. That's not to say this literary giant was
merely the sum of his quips and one-liners, a new Ken Burns
documentary emphasizes repeatedly. Twain was far more than a purveyor
of easy laughs, more than "the stand-up comic of his time," author
William Styron notes in this superb two-part PBS film that is one of
Burns' very best. Styron suggests that Twain's seemingly dark,
depressive streak--he was said to have a ferocious temper and deep
insecurities--"balanced off this need to be amusing and entertaining
and gave depth to his work."</TE>
<TE>   And deep much of it is, most notably his consensus masterwork,
"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," which Ernest Hemingway, William
Faulkner and others proclaimed the father of the American novel.</TE>
<TE>   First published in 1884, it's a revolutionary book about two
ignorant runaways on the Mississippi River. The white boy, Huck, is
fleeing civilization, and the black man, Jim, escaping slavery. The
story is told entirely in Huck's illiterate dialect and from his
point of view, its moral epiphany coming with Huck's ultimate
awareness of Jim as a human being and his decision to "go to
hell"--which is where he expects to end up--rather than rat on Jim.
Although he is a product of the age of slavery, Huck's basic goodness
transcends the corrupt society around him.</TE>
<TE>   Just as this documentary is transcendent because of its
simplicity, Burns has smartly discarded some of the more repetitive
and pretentious cinematic furnishings of his bigger documentaries the
way Twain, a meticulous craftsman, pared down his prose.</TE>
<TE>   "He used the way we talk and turned it into literature," says Hal
Holbrook, who performed his one-man stage show "Mark Twain Tonight!"
for half a century.</TE>
<TE>   Burns and his collaborators use the way Twain talked and wrote and
turn that into profound storytelling for TV. Burns employs much less
production here, and, wine or water, it goes down smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   We hear this story from scholars, from Kevin Conway speaking as
Twain, from a fine narration written by Dayton Duncan and Geoffrey C.
Ward, and in old photographs, most of them showing Twain well before
his hair and bushy mustache turned famously white.</TE>
<TE>   The Mississippi seems almost to have run through his veins. He
grew up along the river, in the small town of Hannibal, Mo., as
Samuel Clemens. And he later took his literary name from the
Mississippi, where he became a riverboat pilot, "mark twain" being a
phrase signifying 12 feet or the point at which dangerous water
becomes safe water or vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Twain was young man river. The 1,200 miles of Mississippi became
"his Harvard and Yale the way that Melville says the whaling boat was
his Harvard and his Yale," says Hamlin Hill. He was a "prodigious
noticer," says Twain biographer Ron Powers--so much so that Twain
said he first met on the Mississippi every character he had ever
created in his writing.</TE>
<TE>   Include that famous little prankster of "The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer," which Powers calls "The Norman Rockwell version of what we
would like to think boyhood is."</TE>
<TE>   Its publication in 1876 delivered enormous fame and riches to
Twain, and we hear tonight that he adored wealth--and the grand life
it gave him and his family--perhaps as much as words. Evidence was
the family's palace of a home in Hartford, Conn., whose household
expenses ran to $30,000 year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Part 1 ends with Twain having it all at age 50, ahead in
the second two hours are financial ruin--he turns out to be a much
better spender than investor and businessman--and many heartbreaking
personal tragedies, as his loved ones gradually fall away and he
increasingly questions God in his writings.</TE>
<TE>   Twain died in 1910. "He was a wiseguy who was wise," someone says.
All the wiser when viewed from 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark Twain" airs tonight and Tuesday at 8 p.m. on KCET and KVCR.
The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young
children).</TE>

<HD>Artists Pull Audience Into Their World</HD>
<DH>'Festival of Solos and Duets' showcases energetic and
highly personal works from local talents, turning emotions from joy
to fear into enigmatic movement.</DH>

<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Modern dance committed to personal, intuitive expression dominated
the stimulating, 10-part "Festival of Solos and Duets" at the
Fountain Theatre in Hollywood on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The quality of the segments varied dramatically, but the emphasis
on individual perception and stream-of-consciousness choreography
made the whole event a testament to the way dance can bypass
everything logical and linear to pull an audience deep inside an
artist's emotions.</LD>
<LD>   Presenting a slate of emerging, locally based artists,
co-producers Deborah Lawlor and Benita Bike capitalized on the
Fountain's intimacy and on the audience's willingness to grapple with
enigmatic images.</LD>
<TE>   In Moonea Choi's "What's Up," for instance, the title became both
a mantra and an index to Choi's restless manipulation of a folding
stepladder. Sometimes the ladder was up, sometimes Choi was up, but
the ultimate question of the relationship between animate and
inanimate matter remained unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   In "Beloved, be loved," Paula Present showed this relationship at
its most life-affirming. Dancing lyrically around and over a boombox,
she reminded everyone of how recorded music can lift us emotionally
and inspire a sense of connection even when we're most alone. "We
will keep each other safe from harm," the lyrics promised, and
Present responded with utter devotion.</TE>
<TE>   Raw fear drove a number of the pieces, starting with Christine
Chrest's "Invasion," in which her dancing grew ever more troubled as
Richard Gray moved ever nearer. The ending (a lift, briefly glimpsed
between blackouts) suggested violence, even rape, but the context of
the piece proved so subjective that we could have been inside a
memory or paranoid fantasy. You decide.</TE>
<TE>   "Closing In" found Kiha Lee counting backward from a fearful
present to years marked by happy childhood games and loving
playmates. In the end, however, she returned to the scary 2000, 2001,
2002 and faced her future heroically. Maria Gillespie, however,
danced with increasingly fractured and flung-out desperation as
voices bombarded her in "Wakatta/Coming In Clear," the evening's most
punishing solo and another testament to a woman's bravery under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Both Don McLeod's "From Out of the Ashes" and Susan Shaberman's
"Invisible Strings" used fear as one component in solos that may have
lost effectiveness through exploring too many feelings in too short a
time. Shaberman's technical refinement and mastery of body sculpture
loomed large even when her piece grew unreadable, while McLeod's
weird resemblance to film star Greer Garson linked his style of butoh
to the glamorous drag impersonations of butoh pioneer Kazuo Ohno at
their most florid.</TE>
<TE>   Three women's duets proved the most conventional choreographic
offerings on the program. Erin Hirsh and Dani Lunn's "Used Forms"
cleverly lampooned a number of temptress cliches--particularly the
slinky struts of jazz dancing. Directed by Carol McDowell,
"Conversations" deftly juxtaposed the classical Indian dancing of
Anjali Tata and the swirly modernism of Alesia Young. However, the
finale, "This Is the Dance You Made From My Dance," made only the
most rudimentary forays into sharing.</TE>
<TE>   "Vein" sensitively evoked the bonds of sisterhood through
overlapping speeches and dream dances created and performed by Elaine
Wong and Koala Yip. Hovering protectively over each other, mirroring
each other's actions and linking their relationship to nature
imagery, they made family blood ties into sweet, mystical communion.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the choreographies on Friday displayed artists still
growing toward a defining style or artistic identity. However, their
freshness and lack of fakery made them easier to enjoy than some of
the hard-sell modern dance nonsense in major theaters last season. If
all the upcoming dance in 2002 remains just as devoted to
truth-telling and sharing insights about the fears and joys of our
time, we should be in for quite a ride.</TE>

<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES THEATER WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world recently became keenly aware that some men still think
women should remain cloistered, virtually uneducated and completely
submissive.</LD>
<LD>   This is also the opinion of Arnolphe, the wonderful and horrible
hub of Moliere's "The School for Wives," written in 1662. Arnolphe
goes to great lengths to train the perfect wife, using the above
guidelines, only to receive one of the most humiliating comeuppances
in the history of comedy.</LD>
<LD>   South Coast Repertory's leaders certainly weren't thinking of the
Taliban when they decided to produce "The School for Wives," nor is
there any evidence onstage that director David Chambers wanted to
emphasize that train of thought. He hasn't reset the play in last
year's Kabul--which might have let the American audience off the
hook. If Arnolphe looked like a member of the Taliban, we might not
have noticed that he could stand in for anyone, of either gender, who
is obsessed with controlling the uncontrollable.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, it's hard not to think of the Afghan parallel when
Arnolphe speaks of the importance of wives keeping their "eyes low,"
or when the suitor who wrecks Arnolphe's plan talks of how love has
"begun to lift the veil."</TE>
<TE>   That parallel is just one more layer on a staging that is already
dazzling in two of its central components: a virtuoso performance by
Dakin Matthews as Arnolphe and a provocative set designed by Darcy
Scanlin, whose work helps usher us into Arnolphe's mind.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews purrs with smug self-satisfaction at the beginning of the
play, as he speaks of his purchase of a poor rural girl at age 4 and
his efforts since then to mold her into the docile creature who will
do whatever he says after they wed. But now that Agnes (Emily Bergl)
is old enough for the nuptials, he's severely jolted to learn that,
in a 10-day period when he was out of town, she has entertained the
young swain Horace (Daniel Blinkoff), who has fallen for her.</TE>
<TE>   When Arnolphe first hears the news--from Horace, who thinks of
Arnolphe as a trusted friend, not realizing he is Agnes' possessive
guardian--Chambers places Matthews' Arnolphe with his back to the
audience. At first this seems a wasted comic opportunity. In fact, it
simply whets our appetite for a series of scenes in which Matthews
alternately vents his rage or behaves with false bonhomie when he's
acting as Horace's confidant.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews uncovers new variations on these emotions with every
scene, wielding his cane like a weapon, his reddened face in stark
contrast to his snowy white hair, which makes him look about three
times as old as Agnes. Despite Arnolphe's sense of entitlement, he
convinces us that he genuinely yearns for Agnes' heart--we can see
the man behind the mask.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers gives him a couple of amusing props that reflect his
angst: a folding chair that refuses to stay folded, and a sculptured
fountain with a mocking visage.</TE>
<TE>   Audience members on the right side of the hall should take a
closer look at Scanlin's surreal set before the show or at
intermission, for they can't easily see a distorted orange hallway
leading to the back of the stage. Adorned with images of Agnes, it
becomes an echo chamber when Arnolphe enters, vividly illustrating
his obsession.</TE>
<TE>   The orange, the green artificial turf on the floor and the lilac
hues of the rest of the set enhance the sense of clashing comic
strains. Overhead float lampshades in the form of women's gowns,
suggesting Arnolphe's attempt to hide the light within the maturing
Agnes.</TE>
<TE>   Bergl's Agnes makes some of that womanly illumination evident from
the beginning. With her grave curtseys, she's hardly a French Gidget.
Hal Landon Jr. and Martha McFarland create a lot of fun with the
roles of Arnolphe's dim servants. But Francois Giroday is too earnest
as Arnolphe's wiser friend. The costumes place the action in the
1890s, which neither adds nor subtracts much.</TE>
<TE>   Ranjit Bolt's translation is brisk and slangy, but occasionally it
bends too far out of shape in the pursuit of slightly shocking and
not always precise rhymes. And why reduce the number of wives' maxims
that Arnolphe asks Agnes to read aloud from 10 to three?</TE>
<TE>   Generally, however, Chambers' "School" is richly rewarding and
deeply funny.</TE>

<DH>Philharmonic program cleverly plays Brahms off Schoenberg,
finding commonalities in the latter's 'Pelleas and Melisande' and the
former's First Piano Concerto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Los Angeles Philharmonic's ongoing "Schoenberg Prism" has not
generated the kind of excitement that its Stravinsky Festival did
last season, it may be a matter of emphasis. Stravinsky was
celebrated as a composer who shaped the future, namely our own times.
Schoenberg, on the other hand, is being viewed as a composer whose
influence we fear. Along with an emphasis on his early, less
"threatening" works, the season has paired Schoenberg with Beethoven
and Mozart early on; in upcoming concerts he holds hands with his
contemporaries Gershwin and Mahler. One Green Umbrella program looks
at Schoenberg's legacy but will have no Schoenberg on it.</LD>
<LD>   Friday afternoon, the Philharmonic, fresh for the new year, played
Schoenberg's "Pelleas and Melisande" and Brahms' First Piano
Concerto. Both are immediately accessible, well-known works written
by composers in their mid-20s. At that enthusiastic age, Schoenberg
was, in the words of the Philharmonic brochure, "unabashedly
romantic." So, too, was Brahms. But Esa-Pekka Salonen and the French
pianist Helene Grimaud demonstrated that there is more to it than
that.</LD>
<TE>   We may perceive Brahms as the quintessential Romantic composer and
Schoenberg as the progressive. Yet in a famous 1947 essay, Schoenberg
proclaimed Brahms a progressive. And both composers thought
themselves essentially as preserving the Classical tradition of
Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, what makes Brahms and Schoenberg continually interesting
is the continual play of Classicism, Romanticism and Modernism in
their music.</TE>
<TE>   For the turn-of-the-century tone poem "Pelleas and Melisande,"
Schoenberg took as his subject a symbolist French play that allowed
him to dig deep into the psyches of lovers. Schoenberg the Romantic
dramatized the narrative; Schoenberg the Classicist structured it in
the formal mold of a symphony; Schoenberg the Modernist evoked
extreme emotional states with extreme harmonies and a complex
intermingling of themes.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Pelleas and his brother Golaud enter a cave, as dark
and scary as the deepest recesses of their inner selves, and
Schoenberg invents otherworldly new sounds in the orchestra. As the
musicologist Robert Fink strikingly pointed out on a preconcert
panel, this could not be a more apt metaphor for our times. We
continue to contemplate the horror of an infamous large hole in the
ground, to say nothing of the terror that lurks in caves, and
Schoenberg captures that atmosphere perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Pelleas" is a difficult piece to get right. A critic wrote of the
first performance that the composer should be locked away in an
asylum and music paper kept of his reach. But one can only imagine
what the performance, which Schoenberg himself conducted, may have
sounded like under an inexperienced leader and probably hostile
orchestra. This is music that requires an expert ability to achieve
textural clarity from a very thick orchestration (Schoenberg was
still a relatively inexperienced orchestrator as well), along with a
sense of dramatic propulsion.</TE>
<TE>   In a superb performance, Salonen solved those problems better than
I have ever heard before. From the very start, he captured the vivid
turbulence of Schoenberg's gripping sound world. The orchestra's
playing was rich and alluring. Solo lines from bass clarinet (David
Howard), violin (Martin Chalifour) and viola (Evan Wilson) had
personality. A drama came to life. But so did an intricate,
intriguing musical structure.</TE>
<TE>   Brahms' concerto shares many characteristics with "Pelleas"--the
same key of D, the same generous scale (about 45 minutes) and a
similar symphonic grandeur. And Salonen conducted it on the second
half of the program, not as if he were discarding Schoenberg's 20th
century for Brahms' 19th, but as if were empowered by the knowledge
that this is music that would lead to somewhere, as Brahms the
progressive. Again, there was bold drama, especially in the rhythmic
energy and the clarity of the orchestral playing.</TE>
<TE>   There was similar clarity and rhythmic propulsion in Grimaud's
solos, if less weight. She is a lively player who makes the piano's
keys all seem to be springs, and her tone has the quality of polished
steel.</TE>
<TE>   The nuances of her phrasing give the impression of being slightly
contrived, and that made her dull in the slow movement. But in fast
passages, when she had less time to fuss, when Salonen's dynamism
required from her instinctive response, she was impressive and old
Brahms sounded newly minted.</TE>

<HD>Johnson's Secret Vietnam Tapes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps Lyndon B. Johnson's greatest fear--that his name would
forever be linked in failure with the war in Vietnam--is realized in
the title of a new documentary on the former president. Yet "LBJ and
Vietnam: In the Eye of the Storm" (tonight at 9 on the History
Channel) proves far more redemptive than damning.</LD>
<LD>   In secret tapes only recently made public, Johnson seems less the
hawkish brute whose policies of escalation cost nearly 60,000
American troops their lives--as he was often portrayed by the era's
antiwar movement--but instead the most reluctant of warriors.</LD>
<LD>   In recording after recording of agonized, late-night phone calls
with military and political advisors, Johnson can be heard trying
with growing desperation to find a way out of the murky conflict.</LD>
<TE>   When he does agree to dramatically ramp up American troop
commitment, he appears to do so only after exhausting all other
possibilities, and only with the belief it will bring a quick end to
the war.</TE>
<TE>   Did Johnson purposely shape his role in these tapes to give his
legacy a historical escape hatch? The program says virtually nothing
about how access to the recordings came about and where the tapes had
been for so long.</TE>
<TE>   The program employs vintage news footage and dramatic re-creations
to bring the tapes to life, the former more effective than the
latter.</TE>
<TE>   Problems with continuity also crop up, as when descriptions of
LBJ's deep resentment of Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy are paired with
phone tapes between the two revealing nothing but mutual respect and
even warmth.</TE>
<TE>   In tapes from the beginning of the conflict, when terrorist
attacks on civilian and military targets in South Vietnam (some real
and some not) triggered increasingly strong retaliation by the U.S.,
there are reactions that may strike some familiar chords for viewers.</TE>

<DH>'Biggie and Tupac' and 'Two Towns of Jasper' look for
insight into the killings of black men.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES FILM CRITIC</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>"Biggie and Tupac" and "Two Towns of Jasper" have everything and
nothing in common. Both are documentaries, both deal with the
violent, controversial slayings of black men, and both are among the
most talked-about and admired films in this year's Sundance festival.
But after that, they diverge in intriguing and even provocative ways,
ways that demonstrate that the nonfiction form is much more supple
and adventurous than it's often given credit for.</LD>
<LD>   "Biggie and Tupac," erroneously titled "L.A. Story" in the
Sundance program, is an investigation into the murders of rappers
Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, also known as Notorious B.I.G. It's
awash in conspiracy theories, deadly record-label rivalries, bluster,
rumor and accusations, all engagingly held together by the on-camera
figure of veteran director Nick Broomfield.</LD>
<LD>   Broomfield, who has made about 20 movies--including "Kurt and
Courtney," an investigation into the death of Kurt Cobain, "Heidi
Fleiss: Hollywood Madam" and "Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial
Killer"--is invariably front and center in his films, popping in,
camera rolling, where people most don't want him to be.</LD>
<TE>   If Broomfield is entertainingly in your face, Whitney Dow and
Marco Williams are persuasively self-effacing. To make "Jasper,"
their exceptional documentary about community reaction to the 1998
racially motivated dragging murder of James Byrd Jr. as accurate as
possible, Dow and a white crew interviewed the East Texas town's
white residents, and Williams and a black crew did the same with the
black residents. The resulting feature proved exceptionally difficult
to pull together, but its honest picture of the complexity of race
relations and perceptions is compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Broomfield, whose "Soldier Girl" played at Sundance in 1980, has
made his share of more conventional, observational documentaries. But
then he became attracted to what he calls "stories that had a big
'Off Limits' sign on them. There is a certain thing about being
fascinated wherever there is a 'Do Not Enter' sign--you think the
secret has to be in there."</TE>
<TE>   To tell those kinds of stories, Broomfield says, "you need to
employ extreme methods; you have to employ different tactics to get
at that level. We live in a world that's changed, people are more
frightened. They've seen it all; they're very cynical and less
willing to talk. You have to get beyond that."</TE>
<TE>   The director wasn't initially convinced that this film, which was
begun by his co-producer Michelle D'Acosta, was a subject for him.
Then came "various suspicions that Tupac's murder might have involved
the Los Angeles Police Department. Then it became much more of a
political story, and I felt I had a right to do it. If you're going
to do something dangerous, know why you're doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Broomfield is a favorite of students, he says, because his films
"look simple, like they can do it, too, and it would be fun." In
fact, he says, "they're a lot more exhausting to make. It took a very
long time of working six-day weeks, quite long hours, no social life,
completely, obsessively focusing on finishing the film. We used to
say that every person we filmed took 70 phone calls, never giving up
on them. And people you are talking to have to see that you really
believe in what you're doing, not that you just want to put a new
extension on your home. The actual filming feels wonderful because
it's such a small part of the week."</TE>
<TE>   Broomfield also makes use of some very specific narrative
techniques. He films almost everything that happens to him, including
people telling him both in person and on the phone that they won't be
interviewed. "People define themselves more in what they won't talk
about than what they will," he says. He's a filmmaker who thinks the
journey to getting his story is at least as interesting as what that
story turns out to be, and he is not shy about using himself as the
film's spine.</TE>
<TE>   "On a structural, conceptual level, it's more interesting than
voice-over as a way to hold the film together," he says. "You're the
connecting thread, taking the audience from one situation to another.
The adrenaline of the relationship between you and other people,
that's part of the entertainment of it."</TE>
<TE>   If Broomfield (despite his acknowledged debt to cinematographer
Joan Churchill) can appear to be something of a one-man band on
screen, "Jasper's" insightful picture of the pain and confusion of
race relations would likely not have been possible without the
25-year friendship of the two directors, who've known each other
since high school in Williamstown, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   It was Dow who had the idea for the film first, using phone
conversations with his friend as a sounding board and being taken
aback when Williams, who is African American, said, "I wasn't really
surprised at what happened because atrocities like that had been
committed for a few hundred years."</TE>
<TE>   Dow visited Jasper and was unprepared to find that it was "not a
cliched Southern town with a fat, racist sheriff" but a place with a
black mayor and black city council members. Even more of a surprise
was "the incredible sense of anger in the white residents who were
mad at the victim, who'd gotten himself killed to besmirch their
town's name." The more the two talked, the more it became apparent
that despite their similar backgrounds, they saw things differently
and that, in Williams' words, "the mitigating factor was race."</TE>
<TE>   Thus was born the two-film-crew notion, which the directors
revealed to Jasper residents only on a need-to-know basis. When they
did, Williams says, "there wasn't one person in the black community
who didn't think I was right; it made perfect sense to them. This
film is about the reality of difference, about being comforted by
those who are like you." Adds Dow, "people instantly understood it;
not to understand the difference in viewpoint is to live in a state
of denial."</TE>
<TE>   The two crews filmed in Jasper for almost a year, through the
trials of each of the three white supremacist defendants, shooting
about 100 hours of footage apiece. Then came an extensive editing
process, so difficult that Dow at one point worried, "What have we
done? We put two years into this project, put in all this money, and
there's no way to connect the two films."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers decided the first step was for each of them to
prepare a rough draft of their footage, to act as if they were making
a first cut to show to a producer when they were in fact making it
for each other. Each first cut--which, unplanned, the white director
ended up making with a black editor and the black director with a
white one--was six hours, and while Dow felt on seeing them that
"there's no way to connect the two films," Williams "felt like I saw
much more possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Working with a third editor, Melissa Neidich (the entire editing
process took a monumental 18 months), the two directors felt their
way to a united version if only, Dow says, "to show the people who
said this wasn't going to work that they were wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "There was an organic quality to making this that couldn't be
translated into a recipe," Williams says. "The making of this film
was very much what the film itself is about: racial difference, not
understanding each other, separating ourselves and attempting to come
together." Adds Dow, "the smallest editorial decision would morph
into a long discussion of race. Sometimes the editor would just pack
up and leave."</TE>
<TE>   Despite how well "Two Towns of Jasper" turned out, the directors
were not encouraged by what they discovered. Though Dow feels
optimistic about some of the changes he noticed in individual
townspeople, he says "the differences of race were so much more
profound than I imagined." Williams, for his part, is even more
pessimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not naive, I'm confronted by race on a daily basis, but this
brought home to me the profound chasm between black and white," he
says. "I'm left with a quality of despair that racial differences are
not necessarily bridgeable. This is the hardest nut to crack."</TE>

<LD>While lacing up my shoes for a morning run, the phone rang and the
voice on the other end said to turn on the TV--the bombing campaign
in Afghanistan had begun. The four-miler wasn't the only thing that
got canceled that day. It was Sunday, Oct. 7, and 30 phone calls
later, the Emmys were off ... again. It was my first week on the job.</LD>
<LD>   During the next month, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences
weathered the greatest public relations crisis in its 53-year
history. Our resolve to go on with the show ultimately generated
tremendous goodwill toward the academy, and we put on a telecast that
even the L.A. Times described as "No Errors, Lots of Hits" (Nov. 5,
2001, by Howard Rosenberg).</LD>
<LD>   Now reading the same paper, the academy is described as "A New
Tempest in the TV Set" (Jan. 8, by Brian Lowry). The charge,
apparently, is that not picking up the contract option on our top
executive staffer (not an officer, as reported) has some of our own
board of governors unhappy and, therefore, serves as proof that the
group is just too contentious to attract leading industry types to
volunteer their time or pledge their support through membership.</LD>
<TE>   This reminds me of what Russell Long, the senator son of Huey
Long, had to say about democracy being "like a raft. You won't sink,
but you'll always have your feet wet." Yes, democracy is messy, but
consider the alternatives. The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences
is a nonprofit organization, governed by a democratically elected
board of governors from 27 different peer groups ranging from
directors to stunt players to executives and virtually all facets of
television.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a vertically integrated mega-corporation where the top
gun gets his or her way without dissent. This is a place where people
are allowed to voice their opinions, and the process can get a little
noisy from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, by the way, the board of governors more than a decade
ago empowered its own 15-member executive committee to pass judgment
on staff contracts, which are often based on extremely sensitive
evaluations of performance. It respects the privacy of the
individual, and the difficulties of preventing leaks from the larger
group. It sometimes means that people in my position get asked to
comment about things they can't comment on, making them look like a
plotting finalist on "Survivor," but that's part of the job
description.</TE>
<TE>   Although a few of our 54 governors wish they'd been more involved,
the truth is that even the people being evaluated asked for their
review before the smaller committee (of which 11 of the 15 members
are either elected officers or governors), a procedure that has not
only the legitimacy of our bylaws and past precedent but that was
recently confirmed by an independent management consultant.</TE>
<TE>   How many people reading this would actually want their own job
performance debated before a group of more than 50 people, some of
whom have demonstrated a propensity for talking to reporters about
confidential information? Actually, most of us get through life being
evaluated by committees of one--our bosses.</TE>
<TE>   We spent our board meeting last week talking it out, more or less
like the grown-ups we are. When it was done, we decided our decision
not to renew the contract was final but tried to respect that
minority opinion.</TE>
<TE>   We'll let our bylaws committee check into it for the future, and
get back to the full board at its next meeting to make possible
process changes, letting governors make that final decision.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and while we were gathered in this Times-described "tumult,"
we also passed the 2002 operating budget, received the award for No.
2 nonfiction magazine in Writer's Digest's top 100 and changed some
awards rules as an olive branch for our sister organization, the New
York-based National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Not bad
for gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   As for the charge that the heavy hitters are fleeing the academy
like network ratings when there's a new "Sopranos" episode,
understand that the people involved in these decisions who serve on
our executive committee include Tribune Entertainment President and
Chief Executive Dick Askin; Sam Haskell, head of television for
William Morris Worldwide; and Fox Broadcasting President Sandy
Grushow, among many others.</TE>
<TE>   As for our membership, maybe you've heard of David E. Kelley,
Ellen DeGeneres, Jeff Zucker, Jay Leno, Mike Post, Kelsey Grammer,
Sarah Jessica Parker, Matt Groening, James Burrows, Whoopi Goldberg,
Norman Lear or Ken Burns. You don't have to belong to the academy to
win an Emmy or even to attend the show, so these people must not have
enough to do.</TE>
<TE>   There's not a production company or a network or a studio in this
town that, if The Times decided to poll its employees by phone during
a management change to hear their complaints, wouldn't suddenly look
like it was, as was recently quoted, a "hornet's nest." I have this
sneaking suspicion that if we polled inside the halls of the L.A.
Times, under the same conditions, that we'd get an earful too.</TE>
<TE>   To pick on the TV academy, which operates largely through the
generosity of its volunteers, seems like, well, what our industry
gets accused of all the time: a desperate overreach for ratings. Did
I say ratings? I mean readers.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next year, we will conduct a historic license fee
negotiation for rights to the Emmy telecast. Thankfully, our network
relations have never been better because of what we've all been
through together. We'll also be challenged to move closer toward full
reconciliation with the National Academy, stage relevant and
newsworthy member activities, and produce a brand-new Emmy show
outside the shadow of Sept. 11. We will even review a few staff
contracts. So the next time you tune in to the television academy,
please use your zapper to channel-surf and get the big picture.
There's a lot more going on than "WWF Smackdown."</TE>

<DH>Business: As economic development slowly comes to East Palo
Alto, there is still controversy when a big-box store wants to take
root.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>EAST PALO ALTO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A stone's throw from some of the Silicon Valley's most affluent
communities, this small, struggling municipality between Palo Alto
and San Francisco Bay has long watched the region's economic progress
from the proverbial other side of the tracks.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with property values on the peninsula having surged in the
last several years, despite the recent downturn, East Palo Alto
residents face the fervent interest of major retail developers--and
some difficult choices that will determine the shape of their
community for decades to come.</LD>
<LD>   Already saddled with heavy commuter traffic, voters will decide in
March the fate of a ballot measure on a controversial plan to build a
300,000-square-foot Ikea furniture store next to the Bayshore
Freeway. The project would doubtlessly bring even more congestion,
but offers the promise of about 550 jobs and guarantees at least $1
million in annual revenue to the city for eight years.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm hoping the community will see that the benefits outweigh the
negatives," said Councilwoman Sharifa Wilson, a champion of the
project. "The reality is: We're impacted by the commuter traffic
right now, and we get nothing out of it whatsoever. That traffic is
not coming to East Palo Alto to shop. It's coming through here and
making its way to the [Dumbarton] Bridge. With Ikea, customers will
be leaving something behind in the form of money."</TE>
<TE>   The plan has sparked acrimonious debate in town, echoing a larger
shift in the city's traditional power base. In the last election,
there were 16 candidates for three open seats on the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   East Palo Alto's demographics have shifted dramatically in the
last decade. As many aging African Americans took advantage of rising
property values and sold their homes, the historical black majority
dwindled.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990 the city was 43% African American and about a third
Latino. Today, whites outnumber African Americans, and Latinos are
the new majority. According to the 2000 census, about 59% of the
city's 29,506 residents are Hispanic, and 23% are African American.
The white population has remained nearly constant, at about 27%.</TE>
<TE>   East Palo Alto has seen other changes as well. In 1992, with 39
killings, it had the nation's highest homicide rate per capita. That
figure has fallen substantially since then; only six homicides were
recorded last year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the city continues to struggle. As of October, East Palo
Alto's unemployment rate was 8.9%, double the countywide figure. And,
come rush hour, commuters choke the main thoroughfares with traffic
as they make their way between homes across the bay and their jobs in
Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   East Palo Alto is sharply divided over what course development
should take. Two council members had to abstain from voting on the
Ikea proposal because they own property near the site. The remaining
members were divided 2 to 1 in favor of the store, so they agreed to
put the proposal before voters. Ikea has hired a public relations
firm to campaign for the project, though the outcome is far from
certain.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents, such as Councilwoman Patricia Foster, emphasize that
East Palo Alto residents are guaranteed priority in filling the jobs
Ikea would bring. And, she points out, the jobs offer substantial
medical and dental benefits, even for part-time employees, plus a
generous tuition reimbursement program.</TE>
<TE>   Miriam Neri, a domestic worker who has lived in East Palo Alto for
nine years, said the city's need for jobs outweighs her concerns over
increased traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "I have lots of friends who do not have jobs because they don't
have cars," she said, using her young daughter as a translator. "If
the store will open, they can walk to the jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, transportation is a major concern in East Palo Alto. Buses
stop running at 10 p.m., and many low-paid restaurant and hotel
workers must walk or ride bicycles home in the middle of the night.
(A new overnight bus route, scheduled to begin operation Jan. 20, has
drawn howls of protest from residents of nearby and affluent Palo
Alto, who worry about potential noise.)</TE>
<TE>   Others in East Palo Alto--actually north of Palo Alto, not
east--say they resent having to choose between economic development
and quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like sticking an elephant in your backyard," lifelong East
Palo Alto resident Tiamona Stevenson said of the proposed Ikea. "It's
already hell just driving to the store after work. People would be
getting jobs, yes. But is it worth the headache?"</TE>
<TE>   Nadinne Cruz, director of Stanford University's Haas Center for
Public Service, which facilitates many volunteer projects in East
Palo Alto, said city property represents "some of the last remaining
vestiges of prime real estate in Silicon Valley. When rich
communities protest and say, 'Not in my backyard,' nobody says
anything. But when a poor neighborhood goes up in arms against it,
they're going to be seen as spoiling this beautiful solution to low
income, which is development."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what voters decide about Ikea, a handful of other
developments already underway are changing the character of East Palo
Alto. A retail center adjacent to the proposed Ikea site opened two
years ago, with a slew of so-called big-box stores, including Best
Buy, Expo Design Center, Good Guys and Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   And on a stretch long known as "Whiskey Gulch" because for decades
it was the closest place to Stanford where liquor sales were legal,
three office buildings are taking shape. By the end of the year,
ground will be broken in the complex on a 200-room Four Seasons
luxury hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all of its appeal to big-box retail developers, East Palo
Alto has been unable to land a single supermarket or bank. Many
residents express doubt that they will reap the benefits of so much
new development, and the debate has become ugly from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   At a City Council meeting in October, a failed council candidate
screamed racial and anti-Semitic slurs at the hotel and office
building developer and her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Underneath much of the opposition to the Ikea proposal is a
simmering resentment of the outside corporate entities that are
leaving their heavy footprints on the wary city.</TE>
<TE>   "This town is what America was like 40 years ago," said
Councilwoman Foster, who strongly favors the Ikea development. "Even
when crime was at its worst here, people looked out for each other.
Change is frightening, and I can hear people asking of this
community, 'Where will I fit in?' "</TE>

<HD>Reading the Governor's Lips...No New Taxes (but Never Say
Never)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis looked awkward dancing around a no-new-taxes
pledge last week. He could have stepped more gracefully, but he was
in rhythm with political reality.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic governor was leaving himself wiggle room to raise
taxes if the recession unexpectedly persists and the state budget
deficit deepens beyond its current $12.5-billion hole.</LD>
<TE>   Never say never has been the prudent politician's gospel ever
since the first President Bush pledged "Read my lips: no new taxes,"
then gave in to senior advisors and reneged. The second President
Bush now proclaims he'll raise taxes only "over my dead body"--and he
can keep his word because there's no legal requirement that the
federal budget be balanced.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, by contrast, a governor must propose a balanced
state budget. He can operate on deficit financing--rolling over debt
into the next year, borrowing against future revenues--but must
specify how the books ultimately will be balanced.</TE>
<TE>   When short on cash, a governor's options are to raise taxes, cut
spending (Davis proposes paring $5.2 billion) or get gimmicky:
Borrow, steal, fantasize (like his banking on $1 billion extra from
the Bush administration).</TE>
<TE>   Davis hedged in his State of the State address by only promising
that the budget he proposes "will not increase taxes." And: "I will
not advocate raising taxes."</TE>
<TE>   That sounded too clever by half to many, and it invited Republican
sniping: Never said he wouldn't accept a tax hike, only that he
wouldn't propose or advocate one."</TE>
<TE>   The governor would have sounded more forthright if he had merely
stressed his desire to avoid a tax increase--rather than seeming to
waltz around the issue with weasel words.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis did make his point: He's firmly against raising taxes
(even if he did propose raising fees by $143 million).</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, one sentence the governor uttered could trip him up if
he ever does try to use that wiggle room. A tax hike, he asserted,
"would further burden individuals and businesses struggling to stay
afloat in these difficult economic times."</TE>
<TE>   No Republican opponent could have said it better.</TE>
<TE>   Davis later was pestered by reporters--and Republicans--to embrace
a Bush-like pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me say this as clearly as I can," he said in a conference
call. "I don't think it makes good economic sense to penalize
individuals during a recession by raising their taxes.... I don't
want new taxes. I do not anticipate that taxes will be raised."</TE>
<TE>   The last comment embraced political reality. It's an election year
for both the governor and the Legislature. There's little chance that
liberals--even powerful Senate leader John Burton (D-San
Francisco)--can corral the necessary two-thirds majority in each
house to pass an unpopular tax-hike bill. Particularly if the
governor isn't advocating it.</TE>
<TE>   So if this is all moot, why doesn't Davis just take the pledge?</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I have my own style," he said. "I like to underpromise
and overdeliver.... I've always felt my best asset was low
expectations. People expect too much of me, I'm in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' delivery of his State of the State address certainly
exceeded any expectations based on last year's performance, which was
the worst of his governorship. This year's delivery probably was
Davis' best, despite repeated, distracting introductions of law
officers involved in anti-terrorist security.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Davis stumbled frequently through solid content. It was
his first major attack against energy price-gougers, but he seemed
out of sync. TV viewers even could hear him chewing ice--crunch,
crunch--after long pauses for sips of water.</TE>
<TE>   This year's delivery of words--even the hokey ones--was smooth.
Davis strategist Garry South says that's because all the little
script notations--"point," "bow,' "applaud"--were erased from the
final speech text. Last year, they confused the governor and caused
him to lose his way. This time, he rehearsed the bows and points
beforehand in the Assembly chamber and scrapped the written cues.</TE>
<TE>   I reported bum information last Thursday, writing that Burton on
the night before the speech was slipped the raw TelePrompTer version,
including stage directions. Turns out, what Burton saw was an earlier
draft.</TE>
<TE>   Early or final version, Burton was repulsed by Davis' speech and
didn't show up until the very end. "Traffic and fog."</TE>
<TE>   The veteran liberal considers it "immoral" that his fellow
Democrat proposes to cut spending on the working poor, welfare moms
and the aged, blind and disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Burton advocates raising income taxes by $2.5 billion on the
wealthiest, but concedes: "To be honest, I don't see it happening."</TE>
<TE>   Davis is deftly sidestepping an election-year tax increase.</TE>

<HD>Groups Push New State Energy Office</HD>
<DH>Capitol: Business-backed plan seeks to close some agencies
and consolidate the duties of others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's energy bureaucracy needs a good housecleaning, say
lawmakers and business groups trying to create a new state
department.</LD>
<LD>   Frustrated by government overlap and a lack of accountability, the
California Chamber of Commerce and California Business Roundtable
propose eliminating two state agencies and consolidating various
duties now carried out by the Public Utilities Commission, Energy
Commission, Department of Conservation and the energy division of the
California Department of Water Resources. The head of the new
Department of Energy would be appointed by the governor.</LD>
<LD>   "We have six boards and commissions that sometimes compete with
one another and sometimes conflict with one another," said Chamber
President Allan Zaremberg. "That is very diffuse decision-making."</LD>
<TE>   The business leaders said they are raising the issue because a
more accountable, streamlined energy bureaucracy might lead to lower
electricity rates. That is exactly what the chamber and roundtable
sought in the mid-1990s when they pursued deregulation of the state's
electricity industry. That 1996 plan backfired last year and saddled
consumers with higher electricity rates and billions of dollars in
debt.</TE>
<TE>   The business lobbying groups said they are pushing reform of the
state's energy bureaucracy because they can't count on lawmakers to
do it.</TE>
<TE>   "In the era of a term-limited Legislature," Zaremberg said, "it's
difficult to do things with long-term goals in mind."</TE>
<TE>   But several lawmakers said they are eager to tackle the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Though they were drafted separately, the business groups' proposal
practically matches a bill, AB 1661, by Assemblyman Anthony Pescetti
(R-Rancho Cordova).</TE>
<TE>   His measure would consolidate under a single energy agency the
tasks of forecasting electricity and natural gas supplies, licensing
power plants, funding energy conservation and planning transmission
line expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Like the business group proposal, Pescetti's bill would abolish
the public power agency that the Legislature created five months ago.
The Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, led by
former Los Angeles Department of Water and Power General Manager S.
David Freeman, is still figuring out how to execute its mission of
guaranteeing that California always will have abundant electricity
supplies. The Legislature vested the agency with the ability to
borrow $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Pescetti's bill also would eliminate the Electricity Oversight
Board, a $4-million-a-year operation that has not met since April and
has shrunk to a single board member. It was one of three institutions
created under deregulation. The board was supposed to oversee the
operations of the Power Exchange, which went bankrupt last January,
and the California Independent System Operator, which manages the
transmission grid serving most of California.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to me that there's no way we're going to get sound,
rational energy policy when we've got myriad agencies with competing
agendas and policies all given some piece of the energy pie," said
Assemblyman Joe Canciamilla (D-Pittsburg), who supports some elements
of Pescetti's bill but is working on similar legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a system that has taken a simple subject," he said, "and
turned it into a complicated problem."</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblyman Rod Wright (D-Los Angeles) said the Legislature
must move cautiously on an overhaul or risk making things worse. To
shift the rate-making authority of the PUC could require a
constitutional amendment, he said, and changes to Cal-ISO could be
overruled by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time to step back and see what worked and didn't,"
said Wright, chairman of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability
Committee. He said Pescetti's bill probably should be amended to
create a task force to study the bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not start fixing willy-nilly," Wright said.</TE>

<HD>Researchers Comb Charred Labs for Data</HD>
<DH>Fire: The UC Santa Cruz building was badly damaged.
Biologists vow to carry on their work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Biology professors at UC Santa Cruz spent the weekend sifting through
the charred, waterlogged remains of their laboratories, hoping to
salvage data and notes after a fire ripped through their building
Friday morning.</LD>
<LD>   The Sinsheimer Laboratories building houses researchers who study
topics ranging from the cell cycle of fruit flies to genetic
functioning within cells. Some of the destroyed work was related to
the Human Genome Project, a national effort to identify the chemical
composition of human DNA.</LD>
<LD>   As investigators work to determine the fire's cause, researchers
said they intend to carry on their work, although it could take a
while to get back on track.</LD>
<TE>   "Money is the biggest problem right now," said Valerie Welch, a
third-year graduate student in the worst-damaged lab. "That's just to
get us started. It doesn't do anything to replace the history of what
people in the lab have lost."</TE>
<TE>   Welch and her advisor, biology professor Manuel Ares, are
examining how cells decide which genetic information is needed to
create proteins. Those proteins then drive the chemical reactions
that are necessary to sustain life.</TE>
<TE>   The research team examines how genes act differently in healthy
and diseased cells.</TE>
<TE>   Ares said he had been accumulating genetic strains in his lab
during his 14 years at the university. Those strains must now be
re-created, which will cost tens of thousands of dollars, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're still struggling with some of the immediate
concerns of getting things together," said Ares, chairman of the
molecular, cell and developmental biology department.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a devastating thing scientifically, but it's also
very devastating for the people working in the lab. They're dedicated
to what some people might consider minutiae, yet it's a major part of
their life and their identity."</TE>
<TE>   Welch said she has backed up most of her research on other UC
Santa Cruz computers, but the fire probably will set her project's
completion back six months to a year.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers will not be allowed to reoccupy the offices for two to
four weeks, university spokesman Jim Burns said, because workers are
cleaning up the building, pumping out water, and drying walls and
ceilings. Colleagues in other buildings have offered to share
research space in the meantime, Ares said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-alarm fire broke out about 5:30 a.m. Friday on the
fourth floor of Sinsheimer, the primary biology building. No one was
injured.</TE>
<TE>   University officials said the fire is being investigated by the
state fire marshal's office and the California Department of
Forestry, and it could be several days before a cause is determined.</TE>
<TE>   Burns said he does not have a dollar estimate for the damage.</TE>
<TE>   The fire gutted the labs of Ares and Jane Silverthorne, an
associate biology professor on a leave of absence to work at the
National Science Foundation. Her work focuses primarily on the
molecular biology of plant development.</TE>
<TE>   Silverthorne said she has not seen her lab. Because the lab did
not house ongoing research, she is reasonably confident that she can
reconstruct it.</TE>
<TE>   "The good thing is that scientists often share materials with each
other and also deposit them" in storage centers, she said. "When
something like this happens, you can get them back."</TE>
<TE>   The 28 other labs in the building suffered some damage, Ares said.
Among them are the labs of associate biology professor John Tamkun,
who is studying the gene expression of fruit flies, and Harry Noller,
a molecular biology professor who is examining ribosomes, the protein
factories of all living cells. Ribosomes hold the mechanisms needed
to read the genetic code and translate it into specific protein
structures.</TE>
<TE>   Tamkun said his office looks like "someone took a hose to it." But
remarkably, university personnel were able to recover vials
containing 1,000 strains of live fruit flies. Only five strains were
lost, and they were not too important, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost feel guilty at how little we lost," he said. "It could
have been much, much, much, much worse."</TE>
<TE>   Welch said researchers in her lab are committed to overcoming the
setback and moving forward.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to rebuild," she said. "Everyone in the lab feels
really strongly about their research. It's just a matter of time and
money. It may be a slow process, but we want to do it."</TE>

<HD>Comcast Is Making a Big Play for Gamers</HD>
<DH>Firm will launch channel devoted to video, PC
entertainment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As video games become the entertainment of choice among young males
with a lot of disposable income, cable giant Comcast is launching a
$150-million effort in April to create a new cable channel devoted to
games.</LD>
<LD>   The launch occurs amid a small resurgence of networks being
planned for introduction in 2002 to fill the expanding digital cable
universe, which can support hundreds of channels. So companies like
Comcast are zeroing in on niche audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Wild, a 28-year-old with a six-figure salary, is exactly the
person Comcast has in mind as it launches G4, which will provide
news, features and hints on how to play specific titles on its video
and computer game channel 24 hours a day.</LD>
<TE>   When Wild isn't spending hours playing games in his Hollywood
Hills home, the self-described "media junkie" listens to music, goes
to concerts, eats out and sees movies.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Wild is in the vanguard of one of the most
desirable demographics for today's advertisers--young, hip males with
plenty of disposable income and the desire to spend it on fun.</TE>
<TE>   Even as advertising dollars dwindle amid the recession, Comcast is
convinced that companies will pay a premium to reach this media-savvy
audience. Purveyors of sneakers, soda, clothing, cars, music and
movies are eager to to tap into this prized group.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast, whose shares closed Friday up 14 cents at $37.13 on
Nasdaq, is convinced the key is video games.</TE>
<TE>   Long thought to be the bastion of nerds, the games with their
near-cinematic virtual worlds have won a broad following ranging from
housewives to rock stars. An estimated 145 million people play
computer and video games in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Though Americans exercised fiscal restraint this holiday season,
spending on games has grown aggressively, from $7.9 billion in 2000
to well over $9 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   The question for Comcast, however, is whether gamers would rather
play than watch television. Games are interactive. TV, on the other
hand, is passive.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of gamers are more interested in playing than viewing,"
said Billy Pidgeon, a game analyst with Jupiter Media Metrix in New
York. "It seems like a waste of valuable playing time. A lot of
companies have tried to cash in on this crowd. But if you look at the
number of game publications, both online and offline, that have
folded over the past year, it's sad."</TE>
<TE>   The list of recent casualties include magazines Games Business,
Next-Generation and online sites Daily Radar, Game Center and Happy
Puppy.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Hirschhorn, chief executive of G4 in Santa Monica and
former president of Walt Disney divisions Walt Disney Television and
Walt Disney Television Animation, says TV is different. "That's why
people watch golf shows and cooking shows," Hirschhorn said.</TE>
<TE>   The G4 management team has an abundance of TV experience. Debra
Green, G4's chief operating officer, was senior vice president of E
Networks from 1991 to 1999. Dale Hopkins, senior vice president of
affiliate and advertising sales, also came from E Networks and helped
launch CNBC. Vinnie Longobardo, G4's head of programming, spent 17
years at MTV.</TE>
<TE>   To round out its team with game industry expertise, G4 brought in
Tom Russo, former editor of Next-Generation, one of the most
well-respected magazines among hard-core gamers before it folded last
year. Part of the problem for Next-Generation was its low monthly
circulation--just over 120,000.</TE>
<TE>   Hirschhorn said G4 can be successful, even with low viewership, if
the network manages to tap into the prized demographic of 18- to
34-year-old males.</TE>
<TE>   "We can succeed with below-average ratings," he said. "It's the
quality of the audience, not the size."</TE>
<TE>   Two forces work in G4's favor. The first is Comcast, which has
guaranteed that 7 million homes will receive the channel through
basic cable subscriptions. That's crucial, as many new channels fail
because they cannot persuade enough cable systems to carry them.
Without viewership, advertising dwindles.</TE>
<TE>   For G4, Comcast is a powerful ally. With 8.4 million subscribers,
Comcast is the nation's third-largest cable operator after AT&amp;T
Broadband and Time Warner Cable.</TE>
<TE>   And if Comcast succeeds in winning federal regulatory approval for
its proposed acquisition of AT&amp;T's cable business, G4's viability--at
least in the short term--is virtually assured, said Matt Riegner, a
cable industry analyst with Janco Partners in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the spread of digital cable systems, with their capacity
to broadcast hundreds of channels instead of dozens, means channels
such as G4 that target niche audiences have a better chance of
reaching more people.</TE>
<TE>   With digital cable reaching more than 20 million homes, a flurry
of network launches are planned for this year, including a proposed
channel sponsored by MTV Networks and Showtime aimed at gay and
lesbian viewers, a food and lifestyle channel called Fine Living from
Scripps Networks and a channel on crime from USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have digital cable, you have enough homes to go after ad
revenues," said Simon Applebaum, senior editor of Multichannel News,
an industry publication based in New York. "But you still need deep
pockets, and you have to have all your ducks in a row. It's not
simple."</TE>
<TE>   G4 has $150 million from Comcast and four years in which to break
even, Green said. G4 is planning to save money by filling much of its
13 weekly shows with promotional video clips supplied by game
publishers and developers, much in the same way MTV in its early
years aired music videos produced by the marketing departments of
major labels.</TE>
<TE>   Russo said programming will include game reviews, previews of
upcoming titles and interviews with game designers.</TE>
<TE>   For Wild, that's enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Video is the best way to understand what a game is about," said
Wild, who last year bought 20 video games at about $40 each, along
with three new game consoles--a $299 Xbox from Microsoft, a $199
GameCube from Nintendo and an $89 GameBoy Advance from Nintendo.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, I'll read game news online. A lot of sites have small
streaming videos, but the fidelity isn't there. And if you want to
download a small clip, that takes awhile. Having a program where you
can just sit back and watch is pretty nice. It'll be interesting."</TE>

<HD>A Shift to Quality by Health Plans</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Newest approach would reward better care--but
give consumers more responsibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six California health plans are expected to announce Tuesday what
they call an "unprecedented" effort to improve patient care and
control spiraling health-care costs by rewarding doctors and
hospitals for quality, not just efficiency.</LD>
<LD>   Such an agreement between separate health plans, billed as the
first of its kind in the nation, would represent a major step in an
extremely competitive industry. It also adds another wrinkle to the
rapid evolution of the nation's health-care system, which is
struggling to build a new model out of the financial wreckage of
managed care.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say that within a year or two there will be a fundamental
shift in the way health care will be assessed, chosen and delivered
to consumers. The bottom line for 2002 and beyond: Employers will
pass increasing health-care costs directly to employees in the form
of higher premiums, higher co-payments, tiered medication costs and
higher deductibles, and with them more of the responsibility for
making the most effective and efficient choices.</LD>
<TE>   Sources said that the participants, Aetna Inc., Blue Cross of
California, Blue Shield of California, Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc.
and PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., have agreed on a common set of
standards for measuring performance under which doctors and hospitals
will be rewarded with bonuses of at least 5% of the billed amounts
for providing quality health care and for avoiding medical errors.</TE>
<TE>   The move follows an announcement last July by Blue Cross that it
would begin rewarding doctors in its  health maintenance
organizations for patient satisfaction rather than cost savings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, beginning later this month, the New York-based
employees of some of the nation's largest companies, including IBM
Corp., Xerox Corp., Verizon Communications and PepsiCo Inc., will be
able to access a Web site that contains the beginnings of another new
approach to health care: information on which of nearly 150 hospitals
in the area have the most experience and the best outcomes on a
variety of surgical procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "These are issues that have been talked about a lot, but health
care is an extraordinarily decentralized industry," said Gregger
Vigen, a senior consultant at William M. Mercer, one of the nation's
largest health-care consulting firms. "Just getting a Web site up
with this kind of information represents a big step forward."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the changes say that businesses can no longer afford
to shield employees from rising health-care costs and that the best
way to control such costs is to give consumers more of the
information they need to make cost-effective decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors say that it was employers' insistence on excessive cost
controls that was a big part of the problem and that now they are
shoving the costs and the liability onto employees.</TE>
<TE>   Managed care, the cost-control-oriented health insurance system
that has dominated since the 1980s, was supposed to have been the
engine that would keep health costs low for employers while providing
decent medical attention to patients in need. But much went wrong
along the way. Patients, physicians and hospitals revolted for
different reasons, patients demanding better treatment and physicians
and hospitals insisting upon higher compensation to give it. Health
costs, expected to rise by 10% to 15% this year, can no longer be
contained.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Lee, president and chief executive of the Pacific Business
Group on Health, a consortium of major companies that use their
collective clout to negotiate with health plans, said, "The archetype
for managed care in the '90s was a health plan driven by referrals to
specialists. It was very controlled, and consumers' choices were
limited. Today, most managed-care plans have few restrictions because
of consumer backlash against limitations. Tomorrow, employers will
look to consumers to be the drivers of the health-care system by
giving them the quality information and the financial incentives they
need to make better choices."</TE>
<TE>   Lee said that these costs have led to the need for a fundamental
reorganization of the health-care system, one that places far more
pressure on consumers to make the right choices.</TE>
<TE>   Experts now say that within five to 10 years, consumers will
choose their primary-care physicians and specialists, their medical
facilities and hospitals and their medications based on a set of
objective and tested standards.</TE>
<TE>   The California Medical Assn. isn't so sure that the rewards
planned in California will represent any big step forward in
rewarding health-care providers, particularly doctors, for the work
they do. A spokesman also wondered about where the bonuses in the
California plan would come from. Would it really be new money that
would get into the hands of health-care providers, the spokesman
asked, or would most of the benefit really go to employers and
insurers in terms of reduced costs?</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups also are wary of the idea. Far from offering
employees more cost-efficient health-care choices, says one group,
the shift of higher costs and direct responsibility onto consumers
represents an abdication of responsibilities by both the managed-care
industry and employers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all cost shifting, putting the burden on people least likely
able to handle it," said Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
Executive Director Jamie Court. "It's an attempt to escape
accountability by the HMO industry's inability to contain costs. It
eviscerates the notion of an insurance risk pool in which you pay
when you are well to extract when you are sick. Now those who paid
realize they will have to pay thousands more. There should be some
public oversight over how these health plans work."</TE>
<TE>   Others view this shift as benign and desirable, as long as
substantial, accurate and easily accessible databases can be created.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an active movement among employers to find ways to
provide consumers with better information on which providers do the
best job and to use financial carrots to encourage consumers to
select them," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution. "In the long run, it should cost everyone less money and
provide better-quality care."</TE>
<TE>   According to a December survey of more than 700 large and mid-size
companies conducted by Hewitt Associates, a management consulting and
outsourcing firm, 61% of those companies were either somewhat or
extremely comfortable with employees' taking more responsibility for
evaluating and selecting health plans, coverage levels, providers and
health-care services. More than two-thirds said they were interested
in consumer choices in creating custom-designed options.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Bruner, national practice leader for Hewitt's health
management practice, said, "We believe that there will be an
evolutionary rather than a revolutionary shift of consumer-driven
health care. Companies will need to lay the groundwork for consumers
and provide consumers with the choice between higher costs and these
new emerging options."</TE>
<TE>   One company moving ahead on this route is Humana/Choice Care,
which says it is creating so-called consumer-centric products such as
online medication choices that show enrollees brand-name drugs that
require a $20 co-payment next to generic equivalents that perform
just as well and require only a $10 co-payment, according to a
company spokesman. That's a step beyond a doctor's writing a
brand-name prescription and the pharmacy's filling it with a generic,
the spokesman said, leaving the patient wondering whether it's
cheaper because it isn't as effective.</TE>
<TE>   Mob Media, an Orange County advertising and marketing firm,
expects its employees to do considerable research and offers an
almost bewildering array of choices for its 17 employees, according
to Mitzi Perry, the company's director of operations. Those choices
include seven types of HMO plans, seven HMO-plus plans, six HMO
preferred plans, three point-of-service plans, two options for
preferred-provider plans and five dental plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Our employees are active participants," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   But even this falls considerably short of access to information on
patient outcomes. That's because the biggest stumbling block to true
consumer choice, according to the Brookings Institution's Aaron, is
the creation of the database itself.</TE>
<TE>   "The current technical ability to evaluate providers of health
care is very primitive. There are individual doctors who have a small
number of patients. There are a variety of factors involved in
evaluating a hospital. We must be cautious about labeling doctors and
hospitals as poor providers of care."</TE>
<TE>   PepsiCo, Verizon, Xerox and IBM have solved the initial part of
the database problem by using statistics that already were being
compiled by the state of New York, said Deborah Bohren, vice
president of public affairs for Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield of New
York, another company participating in the effort. Empire is part of
the network because it has agreed to follow two important standards
of the Leapfrog group, a group of Fortune 500 companies seeking to
reduce health-care costs in part by improving quality of care and
reducing medical errors: having a computerized physician order entry
system for prescription medications to minimize mistakes and having
intensive-care units staffed only by board-certified or
board-eligible intensive-care specialists.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, an insured employee of any of the above companies will be
able to go to a Web site on an internal computer network, type in his
or her ZIP Code and one of five surgical procedures, and get a
listing on the top eight of nearly 150 local hospitals on the Empire
network based on two criteria: that they perform the greatest number
of those procedures and that their mortality rates are lowest. Later,
the participants hope to add a wider range of medical procedures and
a more involved set of standards, perhaps including length of stay in
the hospitals and rates of complications or unexpected infections.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that 20% to 30% of health-care costs can be reduced by
minimizing mistakes and doing the procedure right the first time,"
said Bruce Taylor, director of benefits planning for Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to make sure that the health-care system reinvents
itself in a digital world and we're looking for a tipping point,"
Taylor added. "If a few can institute this, others will follow."</TE>

<HD>Unexpected Resilience in South Korea's Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>While world markets still are staggering from the aftershocks of
Sept. 11 and the economy of Japan is slumping ever deeper into
recession, South Korea is bucking the trend.</LD>
<LD>   The South Korean stock market is rallying and the economy has
proved more resilient to the repercussions of the terrorist attacks
than that of almost any other industrialized nation. Unemployment is
at its lowest level in four years. As retailers worldwide moaned
about a glum Christmas, sales here were robust over the holidays and
are expected to accelerate this year.</LD>
<LD>   "Korea has confounded the skeptics. It has been impressive,"
Charles Adams, deputy director of the International Monetary Fund's
regional office for Asia and the Pacific, said at a news conference
in Seoul last week.</LD>
<TE>   The South Korean stock market was among the best-performing
markets worldwide last year. Its Kospi index chalked up a 37.5%
gain--oddly enough, most of it after the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   This rally has been fueled largely by foreign institutional
investors looking for a break in the economic doom and gloom
prevailing in the four months since the terrorist attacks. Foreign
investors snapped up $2.5billion worth of South Korean stocks in the
last quarter of 2001, gaining a 37% stake in the Korean market.</TE>
<TE>   The strength of the market is all the more dramatic compared with
that of Japan, where the Nikkei has been in a free fall for most of
the last year and its financial sector in a period of retrenchment.</TE>
<TE>   While each day seems to bring forth gloomier tidings about Japan,
South Korean news services are reporting upbeat economic data: In the
last week, it was reported that seasonally adjusted unemployment had
sunk to 3.3%, the lowest in four years; that industrial output has
been higher than expected and that retail sales are projected to grow
nearly 9% this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Korea is the most dynamic market in Asia at the moment
and many investors agree," said Paul Presler, a market analyst with
the Seoul office of Nomura Securities. "If Japan doesn't get its act
together, Korea could be seen as an alternative."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has not been immune from the global economic trends.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus among forecasters is that the nation's economy grew
a modest 2.6% last year and that growth this year will hover around
3.5%--impressive only when compared with the flat growth rates in the
United States and Europe and the shrinking economies of Japan,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   "It is in comparison to our competitors that we are doing well,"
said Oh Jong Nam, an economic advisor to South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung. "If you were to give us an absolute grade it would be only
a B. When you grade on a curve, that is when we look good."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gruenwald, the IMF's resident representative for Korea,  said
during a news conference last week, "Given the state of the world
economy, Korea is doing as well as it can. But Korea will return to
healthy growth and achieve its growth potential only when the rest of
the world recovers, particularly the United States, which is an
important market."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, South Korea was forced to seek a $19.5-billion
bailout from the IMF after a severe liquidity crisis nearly gave it a
reputation as the Argentina of Asia. But the last of the loans was
paid back last summer--nearly three years ahead of schedule--and
credibility has gradually returned to the market. Still, expectations
for South Korea were exceedingly low at the start of last year.</TE>
<TE>   The prevailing wisdom was that the bursting of the high-technology
bubble and the overall global slump would drive South Korea into
recession along with Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. After all,
exports account for 46% of South Korea's economy.</TE>
<TE>   But what was lost in the high-tech field was offset by strong
sales of cars and ships. Sales of Korean cars in the U.S. rose 30%
last year over 2000, much of it because of the popularity of new
Hyundai models.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the global softening also was cushioned by exports
to China and a robust home market. Rhee Namuh, head of research at
Samsung Securities in Seoul, said easy consumer credit and large
end-of-year bonuses paid by many companies fueled a buying binge by
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the first time that the Korean economy showed such
resiliency. That was a surprise to everybody, including myself," Rhee
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the liquidity crisis, South Korea's largest companies and
banks have been busily restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   Although market analysts believe that much more work is needed to
bring firms up to U.S. standards in terms of corporate governance,
they believe that the South Koreans have gone much further than the
Japanese and therefore are being rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   "The Koreans are very conscious of the mistakes that Japan has
made. Japan has done very little to deal with its problems, while
Korea has acted quickly in terms of liberalizing and taking action,"
said Peter Thorn, the South Korea representative of Westdeutsche
Landesbank.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Nam Ki, executive director of Morgan, Stanley in Seoul, said
South Korea needs quite a few more years of sustained growth before
it can be considered in the same league as Japan by the investment
community.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1960s, they used to compare Korea to the Philippines, then
in the 1970s to Taiwan," Hong said. "Now Korea has moved up the value
chain. Its market is still much smaller than Japan, but its products
are competing."</TE>

<HD>Lofty Retirement Goals Call for Some Risk</HD>
<DH>Christopher Richards envisions homes in New Mexico and
Montana but needs to boost his returns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANETTE MARANTOS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 52, Christopher Richards has planned out the next 36 years of his
life as carefully as a military operation. Work 12 hours a day, six
days a week until he's 60. Then retire with enough money and assets
to see him through until he dies at 88.</LD>
<LD>   OK, he's not really planning to die at 88. That's just the
prediction from the actuarial tables in Microsoft Money. Richards
uses the software to fine-tune his financial plans--from selling his
homes in Signal Hill and Palm Desert after he retires to buying new
homes in New Mexico and Montana to leaving a scholarship fund for the
college in his adopted hometown.</LD>
<LD>   On the computer, his financial future looks fine. But Richards,
childless and twice divorced, is uneasy about depending solely on
software to map out his retirement.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Wallender, a living, breathing Southland financial planner,
agrees that too much virtual reality can be a problem when it comes
to retirement planning.</TE>
<TE>   "Programs like Quicken and Money are very valuable for budgeting
and letting people see the compounding effect of the money they're
putting away," he said. But during periods of extreme uncertainty in
the stock market--like now--it's vital that investors resist the urge
to let a computer do their thinking for them.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to watch things month by month over the next [few]
months," Wallender said. Richards should be looking for ways to boost
returns on his fixed-income investments and perhaps tiptoeing back
into beaten-down growth and international mutual funds with regular
investments--a method known as dollar-cost averaging. "That way, when
things do turn around, you've purchased some positions at lower
cost."</TE>
<TE>   Such moves may be necessary for Richards to meet his rather
ambitious goals, which will require $1.3 million at retirement. He
needs to adjust his portfolio to juice up returns, Wallender said,
not easy given the current market environment.</TE>
<TE>   Richards makes about $82,000 a year as a technician for a beverage
company assembly line, thanks to working prodigious amounts of
overtime, which almost doubles his salary. "Of course my social life
is nil and I haven't been to the movies for two years," he said, "but
I'm trying to max out my earnings so I can retire early."</TE>
<TE>   Richards lives in his Signal Hill condominium, which has a
sweeping view of Long Beach, and rents out his house in Palm Desert.
Both properties have appreciated and are worth about $250,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   He spends about $4,500 a month, with almost $3,000 going to
mortgages and other housing expenses, and saves $1,500 a month in his
401(k), a Roth IRA and U.S. Savings Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Richards plans to sell the Signal Hill condominium when he retires
in 2010, then live frugally for two years in his Palm Desert home
until his Social Security payments start in 2012 and he can sell the
house without a tax penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he'll be looking for a home in a secluded part of
New Mexico. And if his plan holds, he wants to purchase a summer home
in Montana by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   Starting at age 62, Richards will get about $29,500 a year from
Social Security and his company pension. Assuming Richards lives to
90, Wallender said, he'll need $1.3million in savings to provide the
$74,000 in annual income he'll need to finance his retirement goals.</TE>
<TE>   So how does he make it happen?</TE>
<TE>   For starters, nearly half the $1.3million will come from his two
properties. Wallender expects their value to increase by about 6% a
year, so Richards can sell his condo for about $410,000 in 2010 and
his Palm Desert home for about $414,000 in 2012. After paying off his
remaining mortgages, Richards should clear about $638,000.</TE>
<TE>   Richards needs average gains of 8% over 101/2 years on his Roth
IRA, 401(k) and other investments to make the remaining $662,000. His
portfolio is fairly conservative, with an emphasis on savings bonds
and fixed-income investments.</TE>
<TE>   But Richards is racing to meet a deadline, and Wallender thinks he
should be willing to take on more risk in hopes of boosting his
returns. Among the options: moving some assets into higher-yielding
bonds and shifting some money from bonds to riskier but potentially
more profitable stock mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're this close to retirement, you need to optimize your
portfolio and do whatever you can do to swap out low-returning
assets," Wallender said.</TE>
<TE>   He advised Richards to cash in his $55,000 in savings bonds and
invest it in the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate fund, a bond fund with
10-year average annual returns of 6.83%. That beats the 4.5% to 5.5%
he's getting on the savings bonds. If it earns 8% a year, that money
will grow to about $123,000 in 101/2 years. At 5%, it will increase
to $83,000.</TE>
<TE>   Richards also should switch the $17,508 in his Roth IRA from the
Phoenix-Duff &amp; Phelps Core Bond fund to the same Vanguard corporate
bond fund to save on sales charges and management fees. He also
should increase his annual Roth IRA contributions each year until he
reaches the maximum of $6,000 (for people over 50) in 2008. With an
8% return, the Roth will grow to about $69,000 in 101/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Richards should shift the 40% of his 401(k) plan that's now
invested in the Vanguard Wellington fund--a "balanced" fund that
invests in both stocks and bonds--to Vanguard Total Bond Market Index
fund to provide more of a pure play in bonds, the planner said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he should keep contributing as much as possible to his
401(k) plan, increasing the amount each year as the contribution
limits rise until he reaches $15,500 annually in 2004--the most
Richards thinks he can afford. Richards should continue putting 35%
of his 401(k) contributions in the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which
tracks the S&amp;P 500, and 25% in Vanguard Small-Cap Index fund. The
remaining 40% in new contributions should be split between the
Vanguard bond index fund and Vanguard International Growth fund, the
planner said.</TE>
<TE>   The international fund is down almost 29% this year, but it's a
good buy now, Wallender said. The small-cap fund invests in shares of
small companies, which many analysts think will outperform blue-chip
stocks this year. If Richards can achieve an average annual return of
8%, his 401(k) should be worth about $550,000 in 101/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Given the chance that the market's gains will fall below
historical averages for the foreseeable future, Richards should be
prepared to rein in his goals. If he averages 7% on investments over
the next 101/2 years, he'd have about $1.16 million in assets at
retirement. That would give him an annual income of about $66,500 a
year, and probably would jeopardize his dream of a second home in
Montana.</TE>
<TE>   But Richards' ethic of saving and attention to financial details
give him an excellent chance of meeting his goal, Wallender said. And
Richards, who made most of Wallender's suggested changes within a few
weeks of the recommendations, is staying flexible.</TE>
<TE>   "The home in Montana is a dream, but it's nice to know it's a
dream that could come true," he said. "And who knows? By the time I
move to New Mexico, I may want to stop traveling and just stay home
and read my books."</TE>

<HD>Westfield to Share $5.3-Billion Buy of Mall Owner Rodamco</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>An agreement by Westfield America Trust, Simon Property Group Inc.
and Rouse Co. to buy Rodamco North America in a $5.3-billion
transaction, ending a six-month battle for control of the
fourth-largest owner of shopping malls in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Australian property company Westfield, whose U.S. operations are
based in Los Angeles, will acquire interests in 14 of Rodamco's 35
malls, becoming one of the biggest mall managers in the U.S. Simon,
the No. 1 mall owner and a partner with Rodamco in some of the malls,
will get part of 13 malls, and Rouse will buy stakes in eight.
Westfield currently has a 24% stake in Rodamco.</LD>
<LD>   The value of the transaction is at the low end of a $5.3
billion-to-$6.3 billion range estimated by Prudential Financial
analyst James Sullivan. It furthers the consolidation underway in the
U.S mall business, as the largest owners look to gain control of the
country's best-performing malls. Among Rodamco's malls is Houston's
Galleria.</LD>

<HD>Security Flaws May Be Pitfall for Microsoft</HD>
<DH>Software: As the company shifts toward interactive
services, its latest vulnerabilities do little to bolster customer
confidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Competitors and federal regulators have failed to stop Microsoft
Corp.'s march toward dominance of new areas of the computing world,
but there is an increasing chance that one of the software giant's
own strategies could hinder its advance.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft's decade-long focus on cramming new features into its
products has come at the expense of protecting computers against
viruses and hacking attacks, which are costing customers billions of
dollars a year and becoming a top concern of companies and government
officials.</LD>
<LD>   In just the last month, a gaping hole was found in Microsoft's
newest operating system, Windows XP, that could allow hackers to take
control of a PC through the Internet. The discovery brought a rare
FBI warning to the general public. And a flaw in its Internet
browser, if left unpatched, was found to expose data on a PC if the
user clicked on a Web link in the wrong e-mail.</LD>
<TE>   The latest disclosures follow a record year for security problems,
according to statistics released Friday by the federally funded CERT
Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University. The research
clearinghouse said the total number of vulnerability reports it
received more than doubled in 2001 to 2,437, after more than doubling
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Taken as a whole, the problems do more than fly in the face of
Microsoft's declaration that Windows XP is the safest operating
system ever.</TE>
<TE>   They are beginning to threaten the stability of a major piece of
the world economy and to raise questions about Microsoft's future.
The company badly needs more customer confidence for its shift toward
interactive services.</TE>
<TE>   A surprising sign of how quickly opinion is changing came last
week. A blue-ribbon panel of technology experts assembled by the
National Academy of Sciences said lawmakers should consider ending
Microsoft's and other software companies' special protection from
product liability lawsuits, which have long forced makers of cars,
medical devices and just about everything else to pay closer
attention to the safety of their wares.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of talk would have been heresy a year ago. But it now
makes sense to people such as Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), who
co-chairs the Congressional Internet Caucus. "The producers of
software should be responsible for any flaws that the software
contains," especially if the flaws lead to hacking, Boucher said
after the National Academy of Sciences report. "There's a very good
possibility that Congress will examine the matter."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft acknowledges that it needs to do a better job of making
the systems it sells more secure. The Redmond, Wash.-based company
has begun offering free virus-related support, intensified its checks
for holes and convened an industry working group on how to create a
world of "trusted computing."</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to make our systems more resistant and more
resilient," said Microsoft's director of security assurance, Steve
Lipner. "We want to be unquestionably, unequivocally the best."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adding Features at  the Expense of Security</TE>
<TE>   Many security professionals say Microsoft finally is taking some
appropriate steps. But they also say the company has yet to reverse a
long history of adding features at the expense of security.</TE>
<TE>   "All the things Microsoft has been saying about 'this is better
and that's better' have been blown out of the water," said Marc
Maiffret of eEye Digital Security in Aliso Viejo, which discovered
the flaw in Windows XP.</TE>
<TE>   That hole was severe enough that the FBI told the public to apply
Microsoft's patch or disable the program's "Plug and Play" feature
for automatically connecting PCs to other devices.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft treats security problems as public relations problems,"
said Bruce Schneier of Counterpane Internet Security in Cupertino,
Calif. "They'll fix a security problem insofar as it gets made
public."</TE>
<TE>   To some experts, much of Microsoft's philosophy about security was
revealed in an essay last fall by Scott Culp, manager of Microsoft's
Security Response Center. The paper took aim at security researchers
who publish too much detail about software vulnerabilities, or who
publish before the software's makers have had sufficient time to
distribute a fix.</TE>
<TE>   "An administrator doesn't need to know how a vulnerability works
in order to protect against it," Culp wrote. And software companies
might say less in the future about the counter-steps they take, he
wrote: "If openly addressing vulnerabilities inevitably leads to
those vulnerabilities being exploited, vendors will have no choice."</TE>
<TE>   The debate about how much detail about a problem should be
published, and when, is an old one, but many in the field say
publication is the best way to get results. Without much disclosure,
proponents contend that serious hackers would know more than security
workers. And they say Culp's position is extreme, especially given
the company's track record.</TE>
<TE>   "Some vendors have been very slow to respond to vulnerabilities,"
said Larry Rogers of CERT. "Only after the notion of broaching public
disclosure have they marshaled resources."</TE>
<TE>   Several of Microsoft's changes follow last year's record number of
viruses, including Code Red and Nimda, which spread through
Microsoft's products and cost businesses an estimated $2 billion in
damages.</TE>
<TE>   From a marketing perspective, the pressure on Microsoft is going
to keep growing. More powerful viruses are expected this year, and
Microsoft's biggest strategic gamble is on what it calls ".Net," its
initiative toward more interactive and automated services.</TE>
<TE>   "They're betting the entire company on software as services, and
if you don't trust Microsoft, you won't use .Net," said John
Pescatore, a Gartner Group security expert who worked at the National
Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Microsoft is getting increased demands for security from
business customers, where it is trying to gain ground against Sun
Microsystems Inc. and others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Democratization of the Hackers</TE>
<TE>   Some companies already cite security reasons for choosing other
vendors, and Gartner recommended that Code Red and Nimda victims
"immediately investigate" alternatives such as Apache, free Web
server software that has twice Microsoft's market share.</TE>
<TE>   Security concerns have been growing for years, as average PC users
have become more at risk of penetration or infection, said Vincent
Weafer, Symantec director of security response.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the reasons for the increased risk have little to do with
Microsoft. More people are on the Internet at higher speeds, more new
services are available, and more patches that have been released
haven't been applied by customers. Many other companies produce
programs with holes.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been a "democratization of the hackers," as Weafer
put it, where information has been spread more widely about how to
take advantage of weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is doing its best to keep the focus on the hacker part
of the equation, often calling for increased penalties for
wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of experts believe a bigger issue is money.</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, Microsoft has chosen to activate a new feature
automatically rather than leave it dormant until a user turns it on.</TE>
<TE>   That happened with Plug and Play in Windows XP, and it happened
with Microsoft's Outlook e-mail system, which allowed incoming
e-mails to execute many types of programs, including malicious
viruses that scoured Outlook's address book for the names and
locations of fresh victims.</TE>
<TE>   It also happened with features of the Internet Information Server
for Web traffic, which Microsoft included when it shipped its Windows
2000 software for running corporate networks. That server was the
Typhoid Mary of both Code Red and Nimda, whose effects still are
being felt.</TE>
<TE>   Each decision to include the extra features was "a good business
decision and a bad security decision," said Gartner's Pescatore.
Customers have wanted products with the new features, he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Customers Can't Sue Over Bad Software</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's Lipner agreed that there are trade-offs between
features customers want and security. He said the company has changed
its approach.</TE>
<TE>   New versions of Outlook block incoming mail from spreading through
the address book, and the Information Server is now turned off within
the network server software.</TE>
<TE>   "If the question is, 'is there tension between feature-rich,
usable products and secure products?' the answer is 'absolutely,'"
Lipner said. "We're absolutely moving that line more toward security,
and if we have to give up some functionality or ease of use, we're
paying that price."</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, if the rewards to Microsoft for shipping programs laden
with features have been high, the risks of exposing its customers to
attacks have been low.</TE>
<TE>   That's because courts generally have found that bad software isn't
a product that a customer can sue over. Instead, software has been
held to be something that is "licensed," with many rights given away
after the buyer reads a long list of electronic disclaimers and
clicks "I accept."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft and other big software companies have been trying to get
even more legal protections by having state legislatures pass
versions of a bill called the Uniform Computer Information
Transactions Act.</TE>
<TE>   But the rash of devastating viruses and other Internet attacks has
persuaded some experts that what Microsoft and other software makers
need is more liability, not less.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is actual software liability, I would assure you they
would devote resources" to not messing up, said Schneier of
Counterpane Internet Security.</TE>
<TE>   No such laws appear to be in the works.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what seminal event it's going to take," said Rogers,
of CERT. "Where's the Ralph Nader of the computer industry, who
writes 'Unsafe at Any Network Speed'?"</TE>

<HD>Total Fina Reportedly May Bid for Conoco</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW CALLUS</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>France's Total Fina Elf would not comment on a report Sunday that it
may bid for U.S. rival Conoco Inc., but its U.S. ambitions are well
known--and it may not be the only European oil company bent on
wrecking the Phillips Petroleum Co.-Conoco merger agreed to late last
year.</LD>
<LD>   A report in Britain's Sunday Telegraph said Total Fina Elf was
considering possibly breaking up Conoco's planned $35-billion merger
with Phillips; the newspaper did not name its sources. Total Fina Elf
spokesman Tom Saunders declined to comment. Carlton Adams, spokesman
for Conoco, said the company does not comment on speculation.</LD>
<LD>   ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company behind
global leader Exxon Mobil Corp., also may try to disrupt the merger,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources. Houston-based Conoco
and Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., plan to form the
third-biggest U.S. oil company later this year.</LD>
<TE>   But as far back as November, when Philips and Conoco agreed to
merge, leading shareholders told Reuters that both Total Fina and
Anglo-Dutch rival Royal Dutch/Shell Group had been sizing up Conoco
before Phillips acted.</TE>
<TE>   Either could still appeal to Conoco shareholders, who were offered
no takeover premium in what some consider a marriage that benefits
only Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on both sides of the Atlantic believe that U.S. oil
industry consolidation, which has been moving at a rapid clip since
1998, has further to go. Total Fina made clear to shareholders last
year that it wanted to be a part of that process and gain a foothold
in the key U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   With the $30-a-barrel oil price bonanza of recent years now
history, the pressure is back on the big players to find a way to
grow despite sluggish demand for crude. Total Fina is seen as having
a better chance than many of getting U.S. regulatory agreement.</TE>
<TE>   One problem any counter-bidder for Conoco would face is the hefty
$550-million breakup fee that the company and Phillips have written
into their deal.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo-based Unocal Corp. is the only remaining North American

<LD>Paramount Pictures senior executives Robert Friedman and John Goldwyn
have extended their contracts for four years and been given elevated
titles at the Viacom Inc.-owned studio.</LD>
<LD>   Both executives will continue to report to studio Chairwoman
Sherry Lansing and will retain their current duties.</LD>
<LD>   Friedman, who left Warner Bros. to join Paramount in January 1997
as vice chairman of the motion picture group, takes on the newly
created title of chief operating officer. He will continue to oversee
worldwide theatrical marketing, distribution and acquisition of
movies and worldwide marketing and distribution of home
entertainment. Friedman also oversees the studio's specialty film
unit Paramount Classics.</LD>
<TE>   Goldwyn, who has served as president of the motion picture group
since 1991, will share the title with Friedman of vice chairman of
the group and will be president of Paramount Pictures. Goldwyn will
continue to oversee the studio's movie slate, with responsibility for
development, budgeting, casting, production and acquisition of
literary materials.</TE>
<TE>   The studio scored its second-best year at the box office in 2001
with such hits as "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," which took in more than
$130 million, and "Save the Last Dance," a modestly budgeted teen
favorite that was highly profitable after grossing more than $90
million domestically.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Hollywood studios, Paramount continues to have one of
the most stable management teams. Last spring, Lansing and Viacom
Entertainment Group Chairman Jonathan Dolgen signed new six-year
deals.</TE>
<TE>   Dolgen said he was pleased to keep the management team together,
as Paramount "enjoys a level of consistency and stability few other
studios can match."</TE>

<HD>WTO May Allow Sanctions on U.S. Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Trade Organization is likely to rule today that a U.S. tax
break violates global export-subsidy rules, exposing U.S. companies
to threatened European Union sanctions of more than $4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The EU wants permission to impose the trade tariffs if the WTO
rejects a U.S. appeal of an earlier ruling, in a case that affects
exporters from Boeing Co. and Microsoft Corp. to Eastman Kodak Co.,
Archer Daniels Midland Co. and General Electric Co.</LD>
<LD>   The potential damages are the highest in the seven-year history of
the world trade arbiter. A WTO dispute panel found last August that
even after an overhaul, a U.S. law that allows companies to shield
income from taxes on a range of sales is an illegal export subsidy to
hundreds of companies.</LD>
<TE>   If the appeal goes against the U.S., as many corporate lobbyists
and U.S. legislators expect, the WTO would decide around the end of
March the size of sanctions the EU could apply. Sanctions approved by
the WTO usually are imposed in the form of increased import tariffs
on a range of products.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Earnings season heats up this week, with results expected from
marquee technology companies Intel Corp., IBM Corp. and Microsoft
Corp., as well as a slew of banks and car companies.</LD>
<LD>   Investors are hoping corporate America will dish out some positive
predictions for the months ahead, but earnings for the quarter are
expected to be the worst in a decade--down 22%--and that could put
Wall Street in a blue mood.</LD>
<LD>   About 80 companies in the S&amp;P 500 are scheduled to release their
corporate scorecards this week, making it one of the busiest weeks in
the earnings reporting period.</LD>
<TE>   High-tech companies whose results will be on investors' radar
screens include Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., software
maker Sun Microsystems Inc., Nortel Networks, Advanced Micro Devices,
EBay Inc. and Yahoo Inc.</TE>
<TE>   A number of financial services companies are expected to report
this week as well, including J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup,
Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Bank One Corp. and FleetBoston Financial Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The automobile industry will issue a hefty share of the week's key
corporate scorecards, including results from Ford Motor Co., which
recently announced 35,000 job cuts worldwide; General Motors Corp.
and auto parts suppliers Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. and Visteon
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings reports also are expected from blue-chip diversified
manufacturer United Technologies Corp. , Bermuda-based Tyco
International, a manufacturing and service company with dominance in
undersea telecom cable, and No. 4 U.S. retailer Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</TE>

<HD>Koizumi Seeks to Boost Trade Ties in Asia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who ends a tour of
Southeast Asia today, is hoping improved trade with the region will
help pull the second-largest economy out of its third recession in a
decade.</LD>
<LD>   Koizumi, in a speech in Singapore today, is expected to outline
his vision of closer trade ties with the Philippines, Malaysia,
Thailand and Indonesia. On Sunday, Koizumi and Singapore's prime
minister, Goh Chok Tong, signed a free-trade agreement that may serve
as a model for the rest of the region.</LD>
<LD>   Japan will have to work hard to overcome the pull of China, which
is building stronger ties in the region even as its entry into the
World Trade Organization draws away foreign investment. In November,
China and the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreed
to form a free-trade area within a decade.</LD>
<TE>   Improved trade ties with ASEAN would boost Japan's $100 billion of
two-way commerce with the region and help companies such as Sony
Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. expand sales. Southeast
Asia buys a fifth of Japan's electronics exports.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi's tour comes as the region's economies are showing signs
of recovering from a slump caused by tumbling exports of
semiconductors and other goods to the U.S., the biggest market for
most of Asia. Singapore's economy grew an annual 4.3% in the fourth
quarter after shrinking at a 10% pace in the first nine months, the
government estimates.</TE>

production and marketing for 13 sequels to such hits as "Star Wars,"
"Lord of the Rings," "Harry Potter," "Men in Black," "Stuart Little,"
"Austin Powers," "Spy Kids," "Star Trek," "Analyze This" and the next
James Bond movie.</LD>
<LD>   Although this year doesn't boast the most sequels--there were 17
in 1994--it's a record for the most high-profile, expensive sequels
in a 12-month period, with many costing more than $100 million to
produce.</LD>
<TE>   In a volatile, high-stakes business in which it's a struggle
to make money back on most movies, let alone turn a profit amid
escalating costs, sequels offer a way for studios to hedge their
bets.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to go for sure things," said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co.</TE>
<TE>   Having a recognizable title often gives studios a leg up,
especially in the critical first days of release, though executives
know there's no such thing as a slam-dunk in the movie business.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they say having a big sequel or two in their mix of movies
relieves at least some of the anxiety inherent in releasing other
costly "tent pole" movies.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion of doing a sequel carries a certain comfort level
because there's a built-in demand, which helps mitigate the risk
associated with the high cost of making and marketing movies," said
Warner Bros. President Alan Horn.</TE>
<TE>   Given how high the financial stakes are, Columbia Pictures
Chairman Amy Pascal said, "Knowing anything is good."</TE>
<TE>   The "comfort level" studio chiefs refer to has risen to new
heights in recent years with windfalls from such blockbuster titles
as "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace" (technically a prequel),
"Toy Story 2," "Lost World: Jurassic Park," "Mission: Impossible 2"
and "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, half of the top 10 grossing films were sequels: "Rush
Hour 2," "Jurassic Park III," "The Mummy Returns," "Hannibal" and
"American Pie 2." Add "Dr. Doolittle 2," and that accounts for six
out of the top 15.</TE>
<TE>   The new reality--even if short-lived--is that sequels have in
recent years been out-grossing their predecessors, laying to rest the
conventional wisdom that they typically generate just two-thirds of
the original.</TE>
<TE>   Recent sequels that upstaged the originals at the
box office include "Rush Hour 2," "Mission: Impossible 2," "Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," "American Pie 2" and "Hannibal."</TE>
<TE>   "Empirical evidence tells us that the old rule of thumb is thrown
out the window," Horn said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if a sequel now grosses only two-thirds of its
predecessor, "it's considered a major failure," Dergarabedian said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's "Scary Movie 2," which grossed $71.3 million, was
considered a disappointment when it took in less than half of the
original's $157 million.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are sequels that are out-and-out flops. If audiences
feel they're not getting something familiar yet new-and-improved,
forget it. Moviegoers showed up in droves to see "The Blair Witch
Project," "Speed" and "Babe" but flatly rejected their sequels.</TE>
<TE>   "People want continuity and improvement," Dergarabedian said.
"They used to expect less from sequels; now they expect more."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't lost on the studios and filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "You have the responsibility to make a sequel a complete,
stand-alone movie that is good in and of itself," Pascal said.</TE>
<TE>   Her studio is releasing two $100-million-plus sequels this summer,
"Men in Black 2" and "Stuart Little 2," and the under-$30-million
sequel "Once Upon a Time in Mexico: Desperado 2."</TE>
<TE>   Stacey Snider, chairwoman of Universal Pictures, which
profited last year with three sequels, "The Mummy Returns," "Jurassic Park
III" and "American Pie 2," said, "You have to give audiences enough
of what they experienced before to satisfy expectations, but you have
to take the sequel to another level. You can't just redo the same
movie."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Sean Daniel, who made both "Mummy" films, concurred that
everyone involved in sequels "understands that the asset must be
protected and expanded."</TE>
<TE>   And, as studio executives acknowledge, poorly made sequels can put
an entire movie series in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't make a good sequel, you can kill a franchise," said
John Goldwyn, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures Motion Picture
Group.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount's longtime franchise "Star Trek" has experienced fallow
periods over the years, as has MGM's James Bond series--both of which
have been revived in recent years. This year, Paramount is releasing
the 10th installment of "Star Trek," and MGM, the 20th Bond movie.
The value of a successful franchise goes beyond the box office.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very important part of our strategy," Snider said.
"There's evidence now that a successful brand can drive all other
businesses. And, they're designed to that end."</TE>
<TE>   Universal's "The Mummy" not only grossed $155 million at the U.S.
box office but also enjoyed huge success on home video and DVD and
gave birth to a theme park attraction, an animated series and an
interactive game.</TE>
<TE>   "Mummy" producer Daniel notes how the advent of
repeated home video viewings greatly expanded the theatrical audience for
movies and their sequels.</TE>
<TE>   The classic example is New Line's original "Austin Powers," which
grossed just $53 million in theaters but was a huge hit on video,
thus creating demand for a sequel.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" racked up $205.4
million and is today the eighth-highest-grossing sequel of all time.
It grossed more in its opening weekend ($54.9 million) than the first
film did in its entire theatrical run.</TE>
<TE>   DVDs, as Dergarabedian points out, have become a strong marketing
tool to promote sequels. "They get moviegoers pumped up to see the
next film," he said. The reverse also can happen.</TE>
<TE>   MGM's release of "Hannibal" last year prompted the sale of 2.5
million DVDs of the film's 10-year-old predecessor, "Silence of the
Lambs," studio Vice Chairman Chris McGurk said. AOL Time Warner-owned
Warner Bros. and New Line were so confident in the potential value of
their respective literary adaptations of "Harry Potter" and "Lord of
the Rings" that each made huge financial commitments to make the
sequels before the first movies were released.</TE>
<TE>   Warner also is simultaneously making two expensive sequels to its
hit "The Matrix," both of which are due out in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Sequels don't come cheap. They often cost two to three times more
than the originals, most often because of higher star and filmmaker
salaries, profit participation and lavish special effects.</TE>
<TE>   It took the management of Sony-owned Columbia Pictures nearly two
years to put together deals it was comfortable enough with to
green-light Barry Sonnenfeld's "Men in Black 2," starring Will Smith
and Tommy Lee Jones. The studio is said to be guaranteeing the stars
and filmmakers a huge chunk of first-dollar gross income from the
film, which is costing around $140 million to make.</TE>
<TE>   Pascal would say only, "Everybody has to be a partner.... We made
financial arrangements where everyone makes money in success,
including the studio."</TE>

<LD>Question: I am frustrated with my work and am contemplating leaving
shortly.</LD>
<LD>   If I leave on my own, can I still apply for and receive
unemployment payments until I have found a new job?</LD>
<LD>   --M.H., Palm Springs</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Normally, you are not entitled to state unemployment
benefits if you resign. You might qualify, however, if you could
argue that your resignation was not really voluntary because of an
inappropriate workplace situation.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if you left because of employer discrimination,
illegal activities, failure to pay wages or failure to comply with
other workplace laws, your resignation would be considered
involuntary. No one could be expected to work in that type of
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if any of those events occurred during the course of
employment and you were forced to resign, you may also have a
"constructive wrongful termination" claim for damages against the
employer, in addition to the claim for unemployment benefits from the
state.</TE>
<TE>   It is always better to do your homework before making a major
decision such as terminating your employment. It's best to evaluate
the financial consequences of your resignation, even consulting with
an attorney, before departing.</TE>

<TE>   No Legal Obligation to Divulge New Employer</TE>
<TE>   Q: After submitting my resignation at the travel agency where I
work, I have been approached several times by the owner and manager,
asking the name of my new employer.</TE>
<TE>   Am I obligated to tell them?</TE>
<TE>   I have chosen not to say, which leads them to believe that I will
be taking accounts with me. I have no contract.</TE>
<TE>   --I.H., Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   A: You have no legal obligation to tell the travel agency the name
of the company where you will be working next.</TE>
<TE>   However, whether or not you have a contract with the travel
agency, you do have a legal obligation not to use trade secret
information belonging to the travel agency for your own benefit or
for the benefit of your new employer.</TE>
<TE>   This obligation may make it unlawful to take accounts with you.</TE>

<TE>   Manipulation of Resume Is Never a Good Idea</TE>
<TE>   Q: A good friend just moved back to California and is looking for
a job.</TE>
<TE>   He is what I call a victim of the hired-gun syndrome. He gets
hired and paid big bucks to fix a problem--and once it's fixed, he's
let go. He wants to manipulate his resume and I disagree.</TE>
<TE>   What's your view?</TE>
<TE>   --R.C., Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   A: You are absolutely correct. Under no circumstances should your
friend manipulate his resume.</TE>
<TE>   In the most visible example recently, George O'Leary lost his job
as Notre Dame's football coach over "manipulations" of his resume.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies conduct thorough background checks on potential
employees, so it is possible to get caught.</TE>
<TE>   But fear of getting caught should not be the main reason to be
honest and straightforward on a resume. Integrity and honesty are the
most highly valued characteristics for people in professional and
leadership positions, and your friend should consider the potential
damage to his professional reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, being honest is simply the right thing to do.</TE>

<TE>   Retirement Benefits at Risk if Laid Off?</TE>
<TE>   Q: I became eligible for early retirement at my company but
decided to continue working. If my employer decides to lay me off
because of a slowdown in business, can I retire instead so I can get
the retirement benefits?</TE>
<TE>   --D.A., Laguna Hills</TE>
<TE>   A: You need to review the provisions in your retirement plan's
"summary plan description," which your employer was required to give
you. That document will explain your eligibility for retirement
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Under most plans, your retirement benefits would not be decreased
if you were to be laid off rather than to retire voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some plans provide for enhanced retirement benefits if
you are laid off because of events such as a plant closure.</TE>

<HD>Film Companies Intermedia and Spyglass to Merge</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The deal, expected to close by the end of
next month, is the latest in flurry of mid-size consolidations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intermedia and Spyglass Entertainment Group on Sunday announced plans
to merge, in a deal that would create one of the world's largest
independent film companies with more than $600 million in annual
revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, expected to be completed by the end of February, is the
latest in a flurry of consolidations among mid-size film companies
seeking sufficient scale to ride through the peaks and valleys of
big-budget film production.</LD>
<LD>   The companies declined to disclose financial details.</LD>
<TE>   Spyglass, a closely held Los Angeles company, financed and
produced "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable," while Intermedia, which
is publicly traded on the German Neuer market under its Munich-based
parent Internationalmedia, produced "K-PAX" and "The Wedding
Planner," among others.</TE>
<TE>   Film industry veterans say the merger would bolster the financial
health of both companies.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an excellent idea," said longtime independent film
financier Lewis Horwitz. "It's a very difficult time right now for
all independent filmmakers because of the softness of the world
economy."</TE>
<TE>   For Spyglass, the merger would give it wider access to capital.
Spyglass, which is 10%-owned by Walt Disney Co., last February filed
to go public on the German bourse, but later pulled its filings after
the market's once voracious appetite for entertainment companies
waned.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also would give founders Nigel Sinclair, Guy East and
Moritz Borman a chance to cash in on significant holdings. Sinclair
and East together own about 25% of Intermedia valued at roughly $120
million, while Borman owns about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1996 by Sinclair and East, Intermedia in 2000 merged
with Pacifica, a film company owned by Borman. Later that year, the
three took their company public in Germany, raising more than $250
million in operating cash.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, the company was valued at about $1 billion. Last
week, the company was valued at about $630 million. In December,
Intermedia acquired Santa Monica-based Initial Entertainment Group,
which financed such films as "Ali" and "Traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum collectively own
80% of the company, which gets well over half of its revenue from an
exclusive contract to distribute films from Disney's Buena Vista
Pictures in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Barber, Birnbaum and Borman will be co-chairmen of the combined
company. Sinclair and East will relinquish their seats on the board
of Intermedia, but will remain with the company to produce films.</TE>

<HD>Univision Aims 3rd Network at Bilinguals</HD>
<DH>Television: TeleFutura hopes to win over the elusive
English-speaking Latino audience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spanish-language television giant Univision Communications launches a
third network today in an ambitious attempt to capture the company's
most elusive audience: bilingual Latinos who primarily watch
English-language television.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based company has spent more than $1.4 billion
during the last year to expand its dominance in the Spanish- language
media sector by piecing together the new broadcast network it is
calling TeleFutura.</LD>
<LD>   When TeleFutura goes on the air at 4 p.m., it will reach an
estimated 80% of Latino households nationwide. The network initially
will consist of 42 stations, including 13 that Univision acquired
during the last year from Barry Diller's USA Networks for $1.1
billion.</LD>
<TE>   Univision executives predict that TeleFutura will break even
during its first year and will immediately come in No. 2 in the
ratings race behind Univision's flagship network.</TE>
<TE>   "TeleFutura could become a bigger network than Univision," said
Ray Rodriguez, president and chief operating officer of Univision
Networks. "There is this huge audience that is not watching Univision
and a large percentage are Spanish speakers."</TE>
<TE>   Univision commands 80% of the U.S. Spanish-language television
market. However, less than half of all U.S. Latino households
regularly tune in to Univision or its rival network Telemundo, and
those are the viewers TeleFutura hopes to attract, Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   "Univision and Telemundo don't meet the needs of all Hispanics,"
said Carlos Santiago, co-chairman of Santiago &amp; Valdes Solutions, a
San Francisco marketing firm. "We don't have that many choices. You
either can watch a telenovela on Telemundo or a telenovela on
Univision."</TE>
<TE>   Telenovelas, the low-cost Latin American soap operas, have become
the bread and butter of Spanish-language television. But no
prime-time telenovelas will appear on TeleFutura.</TE>
<TE>   The new network's evening schedule will be filled with sports and
news capsules and dubbed Hollywood movies such as "The Mambo Kings,"
"Tango and Cash," and "Dog Day Afternoon." The network will feature
Friday night boxing, weekend soccer matches and a daily 11 p.m.
ESPN-style sports highlights program called "Contacto Deportivo"
(Contact Sports) to attract male viewers. Telenovelas have been
relegated to the afternoon slot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Counter-Programming' for a Broad Audience</TE>
<TE>   Univision calls its strategy "counter-programming." The idea is to
offer viewers different selections without directly competing with
programs found on the original network. The company says it is not
zeroing in on any one demographic group.</TE>
<TE>   "TeleFutura is a broad-based broadcast network with programming
that will appeal to a full range of viewers--women, men and youth,"
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Univision is building TeleFutura at an ideal time, analysts say.
More than 35 million Latinos were counted in the U.S. during the 2000
census, several million more than anticipated. The increase in
population raised awareness of the potential of Spanish-language
media, and advertisers climbed aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Univision has signed up major advertisers for TeleFutura,
including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AT&amp;T, MCI, Sears, J.C. Penney, Ford,
Toyota, Gillette, Wendy's, Miller Brewing and Budweiser. Pepsi-Cola
is sponsoring a weekend "American Bandstand"-style music program that
will feature Latin music stars, primarily ones from Univision's
record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Univision executives expect advertising revenue to cover the
$100million the company plans to spend this year on TeleFutura
programming and operations.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say revenue will probably trickle in until
TeleFutura's success can be gauged through ratings. Merrill Lynch
analysts estimate that start-up losses for TeleFutura could be
$20million to $30million for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts predict that TeleFutura will break even or be
profitable, particularly if advertising spending rebounds by the
middle of the year, as some are predicting.</TE>
<TE>   David Joyce, senior equity analyst for Guzman &amp; Co., a Miami-based
investment banking firm, said TeleFutura could add as much as $20
million to Univision's 2002 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, a common yardstick to measure the
financial performance of a media company.</TE>
<TE>   "Spanish-language media companies are going to be particularly
strong beneficiaries of a turn-around," Joyce said.</TE>
<TE>   Univision Communications' stock has more than doubled in value
during the last quarter, soaring from $18 a share in late September
to Friday's close of $38.76 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts
attribute the increase to a swirl of Univision takeover rumors fueled
by NBC's announcement that it plans to buy Telemundo for $2.7billion,
including debt.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has been concerned that TeleFutura might simply peel
off viewers from Univision's popular flagship network, thus diluting
the network's dominance in the market.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe that most of TeleFutura's viewers will come from the
Univision network because the company has primarily promoted
TeleFutura on Univision and Galavision, its cable network.</TE>
<TE>   "Univision's greatest risk is to suffer any kind of
fragmentation," said James McNamara, president and chief executive of
the rival Telemundo network. "They're not going to hold on to their
dominant market share forever."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Hobson, Univision's executive vice president, told analysts
last month that the company was willing to make that sacrifice. "If
you don't eat your own lunch, someone else will," Hobson said, adding
that the traditional networks were slow to recognize the strength of
cable and other niche channels.</TE>
<TE>   "They made huge mistakes," Hobson said. "The ones that were early
in the game made very large money for their stockholders, and we
intend to be in that case."</TE>
<TE>   Univision has long wanted to start a third network to join the
flagship Univision network and Galavision.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive A. Jerrold Perenchio often suggested to Barry
Diller that Diller sell some of the USA Network stations to
Univision, Rodriguez said. So when Diller decided in late 2000 to
sell his stations that distribute the Home Shopping Network, he
immediately called billionaire Perenchio.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew there was this huge market out there, but it is very
difficult to put a network like this together for an affordable
price," Rodriguez said. "But Barry Diller had done all of the heavy
lifting."</TE>
<TE>   Other would-be contenders in the Spanish-language television
market--Hispanic Television Network of Fort Worth and Azteca America
of Visalia, Calif.--have struggled during the last two years to buy
stations and gain distribution in key Latino markets.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Univision today will make its final $592-million
payment to USA Networks for 13 stations, including in major markets
such as Los Angeles, New York and Miami. Univision spent an
additional $300 million last year to buy other stations, converted
several of its existing stations and rounded out the network with 19
affiliate stations, including more than 10 owned by Santa
Monica-based Entravision Communications, a company 32%-owned by
Univision.</TE>
<TE>   The amount paid by Univision for the stations is about half of the
$2.7 billion, including debt, that General Electric's NBC network
agreed to pay for Telemundo. Univision says TeleFutura will be a lean
operation, sharing its sales and management team with existing
Univision stations, including KMEX-TV Channel 34 in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "We're launching with programming 24 hours a day, seven days a
week," Rodriguez said. "It's pretty daunting with most of the
stations coming on board at once, and we've done it all in one year."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts are skeptical that TeleFutura will be an immediate
hit. They don't think viewers who watch ABC, Fox and the WB network
will suddenly switch to TeleFutura to watch dated Hollywood movies.
The company, they point out, is not pouring large sums into original
programming.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alliance Formed With Grupo Televisa</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Univision last month agreed to a new programming alliance
with its Mexico City partner, Grupo Televisa, allowing the network to
show Televisa programs on TeleFutura.</TE>
<TE>   Televisa supplies Univision with its most successful telenovelas.
Though Televisa programs are popular with Latinos of Mexican and
Central American heritage, industry watchers say the shows do not
play as well on the East Coast among Puerto Ricans in New York or
Cubans in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is: Do they understand the culture and the mind-set
of U.S. Hispanics to the degree needed to provide successful
programming?" asked Carlos Santiago of Santiago &amp; Valdes Solutions.
"I think the jury is out."</TE>
<TE>   Manny Gonzalez, president of the L.A. marketing firm Sapo
Communications, agreed, saying TeleFutura might do little to expand
the pie of Latino viewers tuning into Spanish-language programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect that TeleFutura will capture more Telemundo viewers
than those watching English- language programs," Gonzalez said. "How
do you capture more of the English-speaking segment if you don't
invest in original quality programming?"</TE>
<TE>   Univision's Rodriguez said the network probably will evolve.</TE>
<TE>   "As we go forward, we will be testing different concepts,"
Rodriguez said. "TeleFutura is a new network and it can afford to be
different. We're going to mix it up."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Marilyn Putnam, 76, a costume designer for such Broadway shows as
"Bye, Bye Birdie" and "The Music Man" and such films as "Annie Hall,"
died Jan. 4 in a New York City hospital after a brief illness.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Putnam designed costumes for the last half
of the 20th century. She attended Hunter College, planning to go to
medical school. But she switched careers dramatically when she
received a Rockefeller fellowship to work with stage producer Margo
Jones in Dallas, where she costumed plays by then-unknown writers
William Inge and Tennessee Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Regional theater led to Broadway and such shows as "Free and
Easy," "Once Upon a Mattress" and "I Never Sang for My Father."</LD>
<TE>   Putnam also created wardrobes for early television, including "The
Howdy Doody Show." She costumed the cast of the popular TV soap opera
"All My Children," earning an Emmy Award in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Putnam also worked extensively in film, dressing characters for
the offbeat "Annie Hall" and "Alice's Restaurant," as well as "King
of the Gypsies," "The Godfather: Part II" and "Reds."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, she served on the board of trustees of her local
Theatrical Wardrobe Union.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mari Kajiwara, 50, a leading modern dancer with the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater, the Ohad Naharin Dance Company and the
Batsheva Dance Company of Israel, died of cancer Dec. 25 in Tel Aviv.</LD>
<LD>   Born in New York City, Kajiwara attended its High School of
Performing Arts and City College and performed successively with the
Glen Tetley and Norman Walker dance companies before joining Ailey's
troupe in 1970.</LD>
<LD>   In her 14 years as a principal dancer and Ailey's assistant, she
garnered such assessments from critics as "a stunning dancer" with
"particular eloquence," "clarity" and "extraordinarily smooth
technique and phrasing."</LD>
<TE>   Kajiwara married dancer and choreographer Ohad Naharin in 1978,
and in 1984 left Ailey to co-found the Ohad Naharin Dance Company.</TE>
<TE>   The couple performed a series of duets, including "Haru No Umi,"
until they disbanded their company to return to Naharin's native
Israel in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   He became choreographer for the Batsheva Dance Company and she
served as a featured dancer and rehearsal director.</TE>
<TE>   During an American tour that stopped at Orange Coast College in
1990, Times dance critic Lewis Segal described Kajiwara as "the
unforgettably serene former icon" of the Ailey company still
demonstrating "a standard of metaphysical fluidity and involvement."</TE>

<HD>William Severns, 88; Los Angeles Impresario</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Severns, Los Angeles impresario for six decades who managed
the Greek Theatre, the Hollywood Bowl and the Philharmonic and then
built the Music Center of Los Angeles County and ran it for 20 years,
has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Severns, who retired from active administration in 1984 but
continued to consult for various arts programs around the world, died
Dec. 29 in Los Angeles of heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than creating the music or the drama, Severns spent his
life constructing the physical and financial setting where arts could
flourish--fueling growth of the performing arts scene in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Impresarios, as former Times music critic Martin Bernheimer once
said, "must be financial wizards, soothsayers, administrative
virtuosos, creative mystics, logistics jugglers, psychological
masterminds, ego-massagers, performing-baby-sitters, missionary
zealots, court jesters, official taste-makers, benign landlords and
cultural czars, all at the same delirious time."</TE>
<TE>   The quiet, modest, self-effacing Severns was all that--a man who
could always get things done yet never expected applause for doing
it--Bernheimer said when Severns was honored with the Spirit of Los
Angeles Award in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Severns is largely credited with bringing together private and
government funding--unheard of in arts circles in the mid-20th
century--in the person of fund-raiser Dorothy Buffum Chandler and the
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to build the Music Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, nobody thought it could be done," Severns told The Times
in 1989 as the Music Center celebrated its first quarter century.
"Not the building.... That was fairly simple. It was the funding."</TE>
<TE>   Employing all the talents of an impresario outlined by Bernheimer,
Severns melded the Westsiders and the Pasadena social elite and
government interests to pay for construction and operation of the
three-theater complex.</TE>
<TE>   He also began preliminary work toward the Disney Concert Hall, the
fourth building in the center, which is now under construction.</TE>
<TE>   But asked what made the Music Center happen, Severns removed
himself from the equation, telling The Times emphatically in 1989:
"Mrs. Chandler, who got to like raising money ... and the Board of
Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   He praised the county lawmakers, saying no one gave them credit.</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been for their willingness to set up a joint powers
agreement, we'd never have had it ... no matter how much money she
raised."</TE>
<TE>   Severns was born to show business, if not to the front office he
came to occupy. He began as a child actor in his parents' theater
stock company in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he came to Los Angeles to attend USC, he was so hooked
on the performing arts that he became an usher all over town so he
could attend the concerts and shows for free.</TE>
<TE>   He ushered at the Hollywood Bowl, the Shrine Auditorium and the
Philharmonic Auditorium on Pershing Square, and, after completing his
business administration degree, went to work for the Bowl as
publicist and house manager.</TE>
<TE>   Severns honed his management skills over the next decade working
in various arts administration tasks, including as an accountant for
the legendary impresario L.E. Behymer, who brought music and opera to
Los Angeles during the 1930s and 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   After six years as general manager at the Greek Theatre, Severns
took the reins of the Hollywood Bowl Assn. in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven years later, he added another hat as chief administrator of
the Southern California Symphony Assn., which operated the Los
Angeles Philharmonic, then under the baton of Zubin Mehta.</TE>
<TE>   Severns managed both the Bowl and the Philharmonic until 1966,
when he merged the two organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Superb "logistics juggler" that he was, Severns also worked for
many of those years on building the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, Ahmanson Theater and Mark Taper Forum.</TE>
<TE>   He served as administrator and then administrator and chief
financial officer of the Music Center from its opening in 1964 until
his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The massive project taught Severns so much about theater nuts and
bolts--from layout to materials and supplies--that he became a
consultant for other theater projects in development. His much-sought
advice contributed to the design of the Santa Monica Civic
Auditorium, the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the Louise M.
Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco and the Roy Thomson Hall in
Toronto, among others.</TE>
<TE>   In retirement, Severns often took on special assignments, such as
that of the Community Redevelopment Assn. in 1986 to aid the troubled
Los Angeles Theater Center.</TE>
<TE>   He also served on the boards of the American Symphony Orchestra
League, Guest Services Inc., the Grand Peoples Company and Associated
Presentations of the Music Center.</TE>
<TE>   There are no immediate survivors.</TE>

<HD>Wang Ruoshui, 75; Editor Who Criticized Mao, Communism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wang Ruoshui, a prominent editor, Marxist philosopher and liberal
intellectual who was purged from the Communist Party for his humanist
writings and criticism of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, has died while
visiting the U.S. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Wang died of lung cancer Thursday at Boston's Brigham and Women's
Hospital. He had accompanied his wife, journalist Yuan Feng, to
Massachusetts, where she is a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University.</LD>
<LD>   As deputy editor of the Communist Party's flagship People's Daily
from 1977 to 1983, Wang led reformist intellectuals, supported after
1980 by party Secretary Hu Yaobang, in calling for "mental
emancipation" from decades of Communist dogma.</LD>
<TE>   Wang drew on the early writings of Karl Marx, as well as
contemporary Eastern European thinkers, in asserting that communism,
with its aim of liberation, is essentially humanist. He attributed
the movement's abuses to Leninism.</TE>
<TE>   In a bold 1981 essay, Wang argued that the problem of alienation
was equally possible in socialist and capitalist societies. He
pointed out that the Communist Party's evolution from the people's
servant to their overlord had alienated Chinese citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "Chairman Mao was a member of the party," he wrote. "He should
have obeyed the party and obeyed the will of the people."</TE>
<TE>   But Chinese establishment intellectuals and their theories rise
and fall with the fortunes of their political patrons. While elderly
conservatives assailed Wang's writings as anti-socialist, their real
target was paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's handpicked successor, Hu
Yaobang.</TE>
<TE>   The conservatives "not only succeeded in getting Deng to believe
in the necessity of punishing Wang Ruoshui," Wang wrote in a memoir,
"but also in giving him the impression that Hu Yaobang was 'soft and
weak'" on dissent.</TE>
<TE>   The conservatives' backlash culminated in nationwide political
campaigns against "spiritual pollution" and "bourgeois
liberalization"--both jargon for Western intellectual trends. The
first campaign cost Wang his editor's job in 1983. The second one, in
1987, saw him kicked out of the Communist Party after 29 years of
membership. That same year, Hu Yaobang was forced to resign after
pro-democracy protests by college students.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Hunan province, Wang began studying philosophy at
Beijing University in 1946 but left two years later to join the
underground Communist movement.</TE>
<TE>   As an editor in the theoretical department of People's Daily in
the 1950s, he wrote criticisms of China's chief pre-Communist liberal
intellectuals.</TE>
<TE>   He also participated in the denunciation of the humanism popular
among "revisionists" in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe after the
death of Stalin.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cultural Revolution, Wang wrote a letter to Chairman
Mao criticizing the Gang of Four, headed by Mao's wife--an act for
which he was sent to labor in the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   "Wang's thinking roughly stuck to the boundaries of official
discourse at the time," said Xiao Qiang, executive director of the
New York-based group Human Rights in China. "But he straightforwardly
admitted that that was how he was trained and that Marxism was the
most credible tool for criticizing the party from the inside."</TE>
<TE>   After his expulsion from the party, Wang's faith in Marxism
remained, but it was combined with a growing conviction about the
need for human rights and democracy in China.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the board of directors of Human Rights in China in 1992
despite pressure from authorities who considered the group
subversive.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, finishing his memoir about the fall of Hu Yaobang, he
wrote that he had abandoned his belief of a decade earlier that
Communist Party rule was compatible with the task of reforming and
opening China to the outside world.</TE>

<HD>Indiana Doesn't Let This One Get Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indiana got the lead against Iowa again. This time, the Hoosiers held
it.</LD>
<LD>   Jared Jeffries dominated inside with 26 points and Indiana took
control with a 13-0 first-half run in defeating Iowa, 77-66, Sunday
at Iowa City to stay unbeaten in the Big Ten.</LD>
<LD>   Indiana, 11-5 overall, 4-0 in the Big Ten, is off to its best
start in the conference since the 1992-93 season. The Hoosiers made
eight three-point baskets in building an 11-point halftime lead and
answered every Iowa threat in the second half.</LD>
<TE>   Last season, the Hoosiers led Iowa by 17 at halftime and lost,
71-66.</TE>
<TE>   "It really helped us to come into this environment and keep our
composure," Indiana Coach Mike Davis said. "I thought there were a
couple of situations that if this would have been the same team as
last year, we would have lost our composure."</TE>
<TE>   Not this time. Indiana forced 15 turnovers with its aggressive
man-to-man defense and contained Iowa scoring leaders Luke Recker and
Reggie Evans, both of whom were ailing.</TE>
<TE>   Recker, who played his first two seasons at Indiana, scored only
two points in the first half and finished with 12 before fouling out
with 38 seconds left. He has been bothered by a hip injury and did
not practice this week. Evans, averaging 18.3 points, scored only
seven, a season low. He has been slowed by a head cold.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to make excuses," Recker said. "We have been
sick, we've had a few injuries, but there are no excuses. Indiana had
a great game plan and they executed it."</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Maryland 92, Georgia Tech 87--The Terrapins (13-2, 3-0
Atlantic Coast Conference) built a 16-point lead less than 10 minutes
into the game at Atlanta, but struggled to hold off the Yellow
Jackets (7-10, 0-4).</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech got as close as 68-67 on Halston Lane's basket with
8:02 left and cut the margin to two points on seven occasions in the
final four minutes. Maryland never lost the lead, however.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Gonzaga 75, San Diego 62--Dan Dickau scored 10 point of the
Bulldogs' final 19 points at Spokane, Wash., to help them pull away
from the Toreros for their 12th consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau finished with 23 points and Zach Gourde added 20 for
Gonzaga, which improved to 15-2 and 2-0 in the West Coast Conference.
Roy Morris scored 18 to lead San Diego (9-6, 1-1).</TE>
<TE>   After trailing, 45-28, at halftime, San Diego outplayed Gonzaga
for much of the second half and used a 16-6 run to move to within
51-44.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OTHER GAMES</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State 75, Arkansas 69--The Tigers (11-4, 1-1

<HD>Ravens Embrace Familiar Feeling</HD>
<DH>AFC: Baltimore routs Miami, 20-3, with a defense that
played like the one that won a title last season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Stay tuned for more ranting and Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   Baltimore Raven linebacker Ray Lewis, the mouth that roared and
often times has bored, was sure the Pittsburgh Steelers were clear on
this matter: The Ravens' 20-3 victory over the Miami Dolphins in an
AFC wild-card game Sunday was only the beginning.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis after all, hadproclaimed earlier in the week that the Super
Bowl was the Ravens' destiny. He was sure the Steelers had a clue
what was in store next Sunday, when the two teams meet in Pittsburgh.</LD>
<TE>   "They know our defense took us to the Super Bowl last season and
the whole world saw what we did tonight," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, a few people in Istanbul might have missed it, but the
72,251 at Pro Player Stadium Sunday got an eyeful. This was how the
Ravens mugged their way to the Super Bowl title a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   A smothering defense that allowed only 151 total yards and forced
three turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   A fail-safe offense that put together touchdown drives of 90 and
99 yards. They finished with 226 yards rushing and got one vital
strike from quarterback and hand-off specialist Elvis Grbac.</TE>
<TE>   A bit of lip that may not be the stuff United Way commercials are
made of, but it is a their way to success. They have the rings to
prove it.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a statement to the teams we have to play, Pittsburgh and
who else is after that,'" cornerback Duane Starks said. "We're back.
We never went anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the Steelers have heard this all before. Like before
two previous games against the Ravens.</TE>
<TE>   "They won one and we one won," Lewis said. "No here we ago again.
They know what's coming."</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens, of course, did devote a little time to a post-mortem
on the Dolphins. The general feeling was, from Coach Brian Billick on
down, that the Ravens had not been shown the proper respect.</TE>
<TE>   "We're 11-6 and win in the playoffs and we got a lot parts of this
team that are much maligned," Billick said. "Figure that one."</TE>
<TE>   The wrongfully accused, according to the Ravens, were obvious to
them.</TE>
<TE>   The offensive line. The Ravens hunkered down for a 17-play,
90-yard drive that consumed 8 minutes 51 seconds spread over the
first and second quarters. They ran the ball 11 of the last 12 plays,
with Terry Allen scoring on a four-yard run to erase a 3-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   And Grbac.</TE>
<TE>   The Raven defense put quarterback Trent Dilfer in a backpack and
hauled him up the mountain last season. Dilfer's reward was to be the
first quarterback to win a Super Bowl and lose his job.</TE>
<TE>   Grbac was brought in, only to fail at livening up the offense and
has been reduced to Dilfer status. The Ravens were perfectly able to
pack up their Grbac in the old kit bag and smile Sunday. But he did
make a few cameo appearances.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens started from their one midway though the third quarter
and, on third and one from their 10-yard line, Grbac and the Ravens
fooled everyone: They went upfield.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Taylor beat cornerback Patrick Surtain and was wide open
... and Grbac didn't miss. The 45-yard completion put the Dolphins on
their heels.</TE>
<TE>   "When the play came in, [center] Mike Flynn and I looked at each
other and smiled," Grbac said. "You could see the guys up front were
a little pumped up, and I was a little pumped up."</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens got to the four, where the Grbac-Taylor duo worked
again. This time Taylor cut inside of Surtain and snagged the pass in
the back of the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Grbac, who was 12 of 18 for 133 yards, ran only two more pass
plays the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think with everything going on and everybody talking about
Trent Dilfer and me coming in here, I think it was a good opportunity
to establish myself," Grbac said. "Quarterbacks make their marks in
the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   That's a discouraging thought for Miami's Jay Fiedler. He
completed 15 of 28 passes for 122 yards. He also fumbled in the third
quarter, which set up the second of two Matt Stover field goals.</TE>
<TE>   Those alone would have been enough for the Raven defense.</TE>
<TE>   The only points the Ravens allowed came after Jermaine Lewis
fumbled the opening kickoff, giving the Dolphins the ball on the
24-yard line. They got to the 15, then settled for the field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was interesting to listen to all the conjecture before the
game," Billick said. "I almost told the bus driver, to just go to
airport and not even show up based on what these folks are saying
this thing is over."</TE>
<TE>   In other words.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I think some people have underestimated how this defense
can come together," Billick said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens did dominate the Dolphins, but were helped out by two
Miami gaffes. Trailing, 7-3, in the third quarter and facing fourth
and one, Dolphin Coach Dave Wannstedt chucked his conservative game
plan and was prepared to go for the first down. But wide receiver
Oronde Gadsden jumped before the snap.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins were trying to rally from a 17-3 deficit in the
fourth quarter when Fiedler threw what seemed like a long touchdown
pass to James McKnight. But the ball bounced off McKnight's shoulder
pads at the six-yard line and Starks snagged it for the interception.</TE>

<HD>Allen Gives Ravens a Boost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Apparently, just about everyone on the Baltimore Ravens is being
disrespected. Add running back Terry Allen to the list.</LD>
<LD>   Allen, who sat out five games this season because of injuries, has
been a huge boost to the Raven running game since he returned. He had
109 yards in 25 carries, including a four-yard touchdown run, Sunday
in Baltimore's 20-3 victory over the Miami Dolphins.</LD>
<LD>   But when asked if his layoff because of injuries is now an
advantage because he is fresher, Allen said, "All I've been hearing
about is my age. How fresh can an old man be?"</LD>
<TE>   Chip on his shoulder or not, Allen's play has helped the Ravens
win the last two weeks. He had 133 yards rushing against the
Minnesota Vikings in the regular-season finale.</TE>
<TE>   "For Terry to be here for us this late is a stroke of luck,
really," Coach Brian Billick said. "The nature of the [hand] injury
allowed him to work himself into shape, yet not wear himself down.
Sometimes fate takes care of you."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Allen may want to talk with his teammates about the age
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The old man still has something in him," Raven tackle Jonathan
Ogden said, smiling. "We'll let him sit down all week and relax now.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't practice anymore, he just sits there and nurses
something."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami quarterback Jay Fiedler, whose contract is up, was not sure
if he will be back with the Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   Fiedler had one of his games of labor Sunday, completing 15 of 28
passes for 122 yards and had one pass intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up in the air right now," Fiedler said. "My first choice is
to be back with the Dolphins."</TE>
<TE>   Miami linebacker Zach Thomas on the Ravens' running game: "When
you are tripping over your teammates in front of you, that's a sign
you're getting blown off the ball."</TE>

<LD>Oakland (10-6, 1-0)</LD>
<LD>   at New England (11-5, 0-0)</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, 5 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How they got here: Oakland defeated the New York Jets, 38-24, in a
wild-card game. New England received a bye as the East Division
champion.</TE>
<TE>   2001 meetings: None. Raiders lead all-time series, 14-3-1, and won
last meeting, 21-17, at Foxboro, Mass., in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   2001 common opponents: Oakland lost to Miami, 18-15; New England
split its season series with Miami. Oakland beat Indianapolis, 23-18;
New England beat Indianapolis twice. New England lost to Denver,
31-20; Oakland split its season series against Denver. New England
beat San Diego, 29-26; Oakland beat San Diego twice. New England and
Oakland each split two games with the Jets.</TE>
<TE>   About Oakland: Despite a nice victory over the Jets on Saturday,
the Raiders still have some questions. They were the first team to
clinch a playoff berth, but lost four of their last six games, during
which quarterback Rich Gannon criticized his teammates, while they
criticized Gannon.</TE>
<TE>   About New England: The Patriots need to slow down Jerry Rice to
stop the Raiders. The last time they met in the playoffs, New England
won, 27-20, in Los Angeles to advance to the 1985 AFC title game vs.
Miami--and eventually on to Super Bowl XX.</TE>

<HD>An Angel Career Is Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many believe former Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina deserved a better
send-off than a one-paragraph press release last month stating the
team would not offer arbitration to the eight-year veteran who sat
out most of the last two seasons because of shoulder injuries.</LD>
<LD>   DiSarcina, a team leader and the glue to the Angel infield in the
1990s, is not necessarily of that belief, but he did admit the end of
his Angel career was odd.</LD>
<LD>   "It didn't even seem as though I played for them," DiSarcina said.
"I just kind of went away.... It was like I was faded out."</LD>
<TE>   There is no bitterness in DiSarcina's voice, though. The
34-year-old spent 13 years in the Angel organization and made more
than $15 million. If he never plays another professional baseball
game--he hopes to make a comeback this spring--his family is
financially set for life.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe [the Angels] everything; they don't owe me a thing,"
DiSarcina said by phone from his Cape Cod, Mass., home. "I talked to
Bill [Stoneman, Angel general manager] and Mike [Scioscia, Angel
manager]. To me, it just matters that they know I tried everything.
Bill's job is to find people who can play, and if I can't play ... "</TE>
<TE>   DiSarcina's injury put the Angels in an awkward position. After
undergoing rotator-cuff surgery in 2000, DiSarcina spent 18 months
trying to rehabilitate the shoulder but was unable to return. David
Eckstein took over at shortstop, and the Angels had no choice but to
cut ties with DiSarcina, one of the most popular players in their
clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   But DiSarcina, who is a free agent, never announced his
retirement, "and what are you supposed to do when a guy is not
offered arbitration other than issue a press release?" Stoneman said.
"I think Gary knows we think highly of him, and we were all hoping
for something better, but his physical ability didn't allow him to
compete. My own career ended the same way. It's not the ideal way to
go out."</TE>
<TE>   When DiSarcina last spoke to Stoneman in October, DiSarcina was
"80% sure I was done for good. I wasn't feeling well. I didn't have
any excitement about the rehab."</TE>
<TE>   But he took two months off and began throwing and working out
again in December. DiSarcina felt so much better he instructed his
agent to contact several East Coast teams about the possibility of
going to spring training as a nonroster player to compete for a
utility infield or second base job.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the Angel chapter is closed, but hopefully in another month
I can sign a minor league deal and start from scratch," DiSarcina
said. "Of course, you want to end your career like Ted Williams--hit
a home run and walk off the field. The way things ended [with the
Angels] was kind of strange. But I want to have fun again. If I'm
sore or worried about my shoulder, I'll move on."</TE>
<TE>   DiSarcina, who has two young children, told Stoneman he would be
willing to work in the front office or on the field, but not in a
full-time capacity. "I'm not going to be a hitting coach in Boise or
an infield coach in Quad Cities," he said. "My family is too
important to me."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels still consider DiSarcina family too. He was a career
.258 hitter and steady defender who was voted team most valuable
player in 1998, when he hit .287 with 39 doubles and 56 runs batted
in.</TE>
<TE>   DiSarcina hit .307 in 1995, and the Angels had an 11-game division
lead when he tore ligaments in his left thumb Aug. 3. By the time
DiSarcina returned in late September, the Angels had suffered one of
baseball's worst collapses, eventually losing a one-game playoff with
Seattle for the American League West title.</TE>
<TE>   "If he does retire, it's only proper that this organization works
with him to announce it," said Tim Mead, Angel vice president of
communications. "And if that happens, we will honor him in some way.
His injury was one of the reasons we didn't finish the deal in 1995.
He was the heart and soul of that team."</TE>

<TE>   The owners of the Boston Red Sox declined to pursue a late
$700-million offer to buy the team and they reconfirmed their Dec. 20
decision to accept a $660-million bid from a group led by Florida
financier John Henry.</TE>
<TE>   "Enough is enough," the team's chief executive, John Harrington,
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a telephone conversation between Massachusetts Attorney
General Thomas Reilly and baseball Commissioner Bud Selig did little
to answer Reilly's questions about Selig's role in the sale of the
team, a spokeswoman for Reilly said. Reilly is trying to determine if
Selig's office improperly guided the Red Sox into accepting the Henry
group's bid.</TE>

<HD>Two Cruel Twists of Fate</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Injuries force Agassi, Serena Williams out of
Australian Open. His wrist problem could be career-threatening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>The weather and mood hovering over the Australian Open today were in
virtual lock-step, creating a tumultuous start to the first Grand
Slam event in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Glum ... and glummer.</LD>
<LD>   Hours before the first ball was served at Melbourne Park, two-time
defending champion and No. 3-seeded Andre Agassi was out. Agassi
suffered an aggravation of an injury to his right wrist Saturday in
an exhibition against Pete Sampras and agreed it could be considered
career-threatening, especially at 31.</LD>
<TE>   "Sure, I'm always worried about that, especially at this age,"
said Agassi, who brought his wife Steffi Graf and infant son Jaden
Gil with him to Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The second blow came in the first hour of play. Fifth-seeded
Serena Williams, who could have played older sister Venus in the
semifinals, withdrew hours before her scheduled match against
Conchita Martinez because of an injured right ankle. She turned it
trying to chase a drop shot in Friday's semifinal at Sydney against
Meghann Shaughnessy, kept playing and then retired late in the first
set.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was unable to practice Sunday, asked for a late start but
didn't receive it and pulled out today. Her departure most benefits
No. 3 Martina Hingis of Switzerland. Williams represented a major
obstacle for Hingis in the quarterfinals, a sizable challenge before
a possible semifinal against Venus.</TE>
<TE>   And so, potential marquee matches--Hingis vs. Serena, Serena vs.
Venus or Agassi vs. Andy Roddick and Agassi vs. Sampras--vanished
into the cool morning and the tournament lost a bit of luster.</TE>
<TE>   Then, fittingly, it rained, causing delays in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Short-term, Agassi's injury disrupted the intramural American
quarter of the draw with Roddick, Sampras and Jan-Michael Gambill,
and for the first time since 1999, Agassi will be leaving here
without the singles title.</TE>
<TE>   His place is assumed by lucky loser Irakli Labadze of Georgia,
who, incidentally, defeated Agassi when they played in September.</TE>
<TE>   The larger implications are more ominous for Agassi. He was clad
in black at an early-morning news conference at the Como Hotel, and
was subdued, still trying to absorb the shock.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain was bad and very familiar," Agassi said. "I'll have to
get back and get to the bottom of it.</TE>
<TE>   "My experience in the past isn't a good one. I attempted to play
through the pain in 1993 [and] that led to surgery in December."</TE>
<TE>   His history with the wrist led him to withdraw, not wanting to
push through the pain. He gave tournament director Paul McNamee the
news on the eve of the tournament but said he would not have changed
his mind if the wrist had improved today.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in waking up this morning--it doesn't feel any better--but
had it, I still would have felt I was in a difficult position."
Agassi said. "Because I'm going into three out of five [sets], going
into a situation where I'm going to hit a lot of shots that are going
to put me in a compromising situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I would still have a very brutal decision to make. Best-case
scenario, I would be playing with a pretty significant concern and
fear in my mind. Really the decision, while not an easy one, it was a
pretty clear one."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi said the injury occurred in the first set of his three-set
exhibition against Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   It started to concern him as the match went on, especially on the
forehand side. His two-handed backhand was fine.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, though, he knew it was serious. In 1993, Agassi
had the wrist evaluated at UCLA and had it operated on by a
specialist in Santa Barbara to repair the damage.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no guarantee how long that would last, so there is a
long-term concern here that leaves me in a pretty difficult
situation," said Agassi, who added he could not even stretch his
wrist back, let alone face a "130-mph shot and redirect it."</TE>
<TE>   McNamee, the affable longtime tournament director, was nearly as
grim but tried to look ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "Andre's from Vegas, he knows better than anyone the show must go
on," McNamee said. "There will be more things happening these next
two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   That was prescient. But certainly he couldn't have anticipated the
next development.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had been holding out hope that her ankle would improve.
She considered trying to get through one match, and with her talent,
it was certainly not out of the question against Spain's Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Williams still found herself restricted in her movements Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to practice and I couldn't really move on my toes and it
was kind of hard for me to stop," Williams said. "I could just take
this one off and come back a little sooner."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Agassi, Williams, 20, has some years in her favor.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't seem to work out," she said. "As long as I'm healthy,
this is just a small hiccup in the road, a small pebble."</TE>
<TE>   As for being denied a late start, Williams took the high road.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be bogus to say I'm not disappointed," she said. "But
I'm here to take it as a champion. Ideally, I'd prefer to have a
Tuesday start, but I'm not here to start a controversy."</TE>
<TE>   Lina Krasnoroutskaya of Russia takes Williams' place in the draw;
lucky loser Pavlina Nola of New Zealand gets the Russian's slot.</TE>

<HD>Kuerten Makes a Quick Exit</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: Men are missing two of top three seeds
after his loss and Agassi's withdrawal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Where have all the sambas gone?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the Brazilians knew something and stayed home en masse,
leaving Gustavo Kuerten on his own. Rarely has Kuerten played under
quieter circumstances than Monday at the Australian Open. The roof of
Rod Laver Arena was closed for his match because of inclement weather
and sounded like a tomb, and there appeared to be just one Brazilian
flag in the upper deck.</LD>
<LD>   Frankly, there would not have been much for them to cheer after
the first two sets. France's Julien Boutter pulled off the biggest
upset of the opening day, defeating the second-seeded Kuerten, 3-6,
4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3, in 3 hours 9 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Boutter hit an impressive array of shots--37 aces and 91 winners.</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten, who has often dealt with back and groin injuries, needed
treatment from the trainer in the fifth set. His loss, combined with
the injury withdrawal of Andre Agassi, means the tournament has lost
its second- and third-seeded men.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries also impacted the women's draw. Fifth-seeded Serena
Williams pulled out because of an injured right ankle, and former
champion and wild-card entrant Mary Pierce of France withdrew because
of an abdominal strain after dropping the first four games to Jill
Craybas.</TE>
<TE>   In early action, two seeded players lost on the women's side in
the first round--Nathalie Dechy of France defeated No. 9 Sandrine
Testud of France, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, and Mariana Diaz-Oliva of Argentina
beat No. 26 Cristina Torrens-Valero of Spain, 7-5, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, the sun emerged, brightly, and the roof opened
again for No. 2 Venus Williams' first-round match against 20-year-old
qualifier Ansley Cargill. Williams defeated the 230th-ranked Cargill,
6-2, 6-2, in 50 minutes. Williams, who needed three sets against a
qualifier here last year in the first round, had only four aces but
hit 32 winners to Cargill's two.</TE>
<TE>   Also showing impressive form was four-time champion and No. 8
Monica Seles, who defeated Patty Schnyder of Switzerland, 6-1, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Williams did not get on the court until late in the afternoon
because of rain delays and the length of Kuerten's match. About the
only person outside of Kuerten's entourage who thought he could do
something here was hopeful tournament director Paul McNamee.</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten, though, has never gone past the second round here. The
local oddsmakers put Kuerten's chances at 20-1 and he didn't exactly
approach this event with conviction, playing no tune-up matches in
preparation.</TE>
<TE>   Boutter, on the other hand, actually put in some warm-up work,
reaching the quarterfinals at a Sydney tournament. Greg Rusedski, who
lost to Boutter last year in Milan, predicted on Saturday that
Boutter would make it difficult for Kuerten. Also, Boutter knows how
to play Kuerten, having beaten him indoors at Basel, Switzerland, in
October.</TE>
<TE>   For Boutter, the unusual rain delays were fortuitous. "I like
playing indoors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His coach scolded him after the first rain delay, telling him he
was not playing his own stylistic attacking game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to put pressure on him, but not so often," Boutter
said. "When we started again, I tried to, but nothing was coming as I
wanted. After, I chose another, looser racket, and I started to put
the ball in, feel my game again, playing some good volleys. All the
pieces were getting together. After that, everything seems too easy;
of course, he was injured."</TE>
<TE>   An injured Kuerten can often be dangerous. The appearance of a
trainer is not always a good sign for his opponents. Afterward,
Kuerten was not immediately available for comment, leaving the
grounds for off-site medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy because you know the person isn't 100%. It's pretty
hard to keep your concentration," Boutter said.</TE>
<TE>   By the fourth set, Boutter started to control his destiny and it
was obvious Kuerten would be on his way home, and if anything, his
fans were the smart ones, wisely saving their money for the French
Open.</TE>

<HD>San Bernardino Coach Gets Praised and Fired</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jesse Spinner thought he was doing all the right things in his first
month as San Bernardino High boys' basketball coach.</LD>
<LD>   He went beyond teaching fundamentals, starting his players on a
weightlifting regimen and taking them to Pepperdine and Westchester
High games for a taste of big-time basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Spinner guided his team to a 3-0 start, and compliments were
showered upon him like confetti. San Bernardino Athletic Director
Vernon Finley wrote Spinner a letter praising his performance and
thanking him for taking over the long-dormant program.</LD>
<TE>   Apparently, it wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino Principal Darryl Adams fired Spinner on Jan. 2,
only a few days after Spinner had received Finley's complimentary
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Spinner said Adams told him he was dismissed because of his
record, which had slipped to 5-6, and his failure to keep the locker
room clean and hire assistant coaches in a timely manner.</TE>
<TE>   The official reason, according to a press release reportedly sent
out by the school, was the team's lackluster performance in the San
Bernardino Kiwanis tournament, where the Cardinals, a host team, went
1-3.</TE>
<TE>   Spinner said he told Adams he understood and thanked him for the
opportunity, though more recently he has questioned the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Most programs give a coach four or five years to get it turned
around," Spinner said. "I was there for one month. It's weird, man.
It's really weird.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I did a great job."</TE>
<TE>   Adams did not return phone calls. Finley declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Spinner said he hired his assistants as quickly as he could, given
that he was new to the area. As for the locker room, Spinner said it
was clean except for a wayward sock or pair of shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Spinner, who teaches special education at the school, said he
would like to coach again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A lasting legacy: Only hours after attending the funeral of
teammate Andre Morgan in early December, Crenshaw players had to
gather their composure for a game against Santa Monica Crossroads.</TE>
<TE>   That was only one of many difficult moments the Cougars have
handled with class since Morgan was shot multiple times and killed in
late November while walking to a friend's house in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw players and coaches received news of Morgan's death
shortly before they were to leave for the Clovis West tournament, the
first time Cougar Coach Willie West was confronted with the loss of a
player in his 31-year tenure. West considered canceling the trip but
figured that Morgan, a senior guard who was fighting for a starting
position, would have wanted his teammates to go on without him.
Crenshaw, shaken by its loss, went 2-3 in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing that they had to come back and attend the funeral, they
never focused on basketball," said assistant Kelly Williams, who
coached Morgan for two years on the junior varsity.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Cougars (12-5) have won 10 of 12 and are No. 15 in
The Times' rankings. "I think they've rebounded well," Williams said.
"They've come together."</TE>
<TE>   One big reason for the turnaround has been the play of Marcus
Williams, a junior point guard who has averaged roughly 22 points and
10 assists per game. Big man Terrence Jones and Leuzinger transfer
Derrick Clark have complemented Williams, son of the assistant coach.
Morgan, who dreamed of playing for UCLA, was not associated with
gangs and had worked to improve his grades, to the point where he had
become an honor student. He died a week before taking the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   The killer was described as black, 5 feet 9 to 6 feet tall,
wearing a black jacket, blue pants and a black beanie. According to
police, he hopped into a car and fled the scene with two other people
who had been waiting in the automobile. Anyone with information is
asked to call the Inglewood Police Department at (310) 412-5246.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More tragedy: Saugus forward Sheldon Bell died late Saturday night
after being involved in a car accident in Saugus. Robert Smith, a
football player at the school who was in the car with Bell, also
died.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheldon was a great kid," said Saugus Coach Jeff Hallman, who
didn't know any further details about the accident. "He was playing
extremely well and had a great personality. He was a big member of
our basketball family and will be sorely missed."</TE>
<TE>   Bell was a senior reserve who added a spark off the bench. Against
Canyon Country Canyon last week, Bell finished with 17 points and
seven rebounds. Hallman said players and parents planned to meet to
consider ways to memorialize Bell.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Money in (someone else's) bank: Jason Sanders may want to get his
checkbook ready.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills coach, who vowed to donate his $3,500 coaching
salary to charity if his Normans didn't make the playoffs, needs his
team to go 5-4 in its remaining nine regular-season games to get the
11 victories necessary to apply for a wild-card playoff berth. Five
of the games are against teams that have beaten the Normans.</TE>
<TE>   Making the playoffs for the first time in five seasons seems
unlikely for a team that is 6-11 overall and 0-5 in the Ocean League.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills, losers of seven consecutive games, has come
agonizingly close in several defeats, though. The Normans lost in
overtime, 53-52, to West Torrance on Friday. It was the fourth time
during the losing streak that Beverly Hills lost by three points or
fewer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Team in turmoil: Woodland Hills Taft (9-5) has undergone a major
shake-up at midseason, with a trio of three-year varsity players
being kicked off the team.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Mustafa Asghari, averaging 26 points, was removed by
Coach Derrick Taylor last week.</TE>
<TE>   "He just refused to be a team player," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Also banished were starters Collins Ezeuka and Tyrone Melton.</TE>
<TE>   Taft's new lineup, which included All-City player Steve Smith, who
returned this week from a knee injury, came through with a 57-50
victory over Woodland Hills El Camino Real on Friday.</TE>

<LD>Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News has a theory about why
soccer continually fails to gain acceptance in the United States:</LD>
<LD>   "It was assumed that soccer would become the favored sport of
ethnic populations, and the tough grandchildren of the Old World
would become the next generation of players and spectators.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the way football was born. Basketball renews itself on
similar and familiar dreams. Or soccer would become so organized,
like basketball, that sheer numbers would produce stars and
witnesses.</LD>
<TE>   "What happened instead was that soccer became the choice of
suburban parents of children without athletic skills, the kind of
kids who once would have been kept indoors to practice the piano
because they were too klutzy to play baseball."</TE>

<TE>   Reversal of interest: Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune
in an interview with John Robinson, Nevada Las Vegas coach, who
formerly coached USC and the L.A. Rams, on the recent trend of NFL
coaches becoming interested in college jobs:</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons, I think, is that a lot of younger coaches are
being hired in the NFL now. It used to be they'd hire guys 50-plus
who wouldn't have much left.</TE>
<TE>   "But there are young guys now and almost all of them have served
as college assistants. And the college jobs are paying so much damn
money now. There's a financial parity--in some cases, the colleges
are paying a lot more than the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Comfort zone: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "Barry Bonds will carry the Olympic torch on its last leg in San
Francisco and will light the caldron on Jan. 18, his publicists said.</TE>
<TE>   "For security reasons the site hasn't been announced yet.</TE>
<TE>   "But Janice Hough of Palo Alto hears that former Astro Manager
Larry Dierker 'has already asked Olympic officials to make him
walk.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The easy way: Gene Frenette in the Florida Times-Union:</TE>
<TE>   "Juanita Jordan, wife of Michael, has filed for divorce and is
asking for half of Jordan's property.</TE>
<TE>   "If Juanita gets her way, that means she gets three NBA rings
without scoring a point."</TE>

<TE>   Coordination test: Mikki Moore, the Detroit Pistons' third-string

<TE>   "I'm the low man right now. But I'll always remember a

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Vince Carter made 14 of 30 shots, dropping 31 points on the Clippers
on Sunday afternoon at Air Canada Centre. He sank long-range jump
shots, scored on drives to the basket and improbable fadeaways while
tightly guarded.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the Toronto Raptors made only 15 of 57 shots.</LD>
<LD>   Game over.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers couldn't mess it up with those odds. They bent but
didn't break, absorbing the best Carter could offer and escaped with
a hard-earned 79-72 victory before a muted sellout crowd of 19,800.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers ended their four-game losing streak, winning for only
the third time in 15 road games. Lamar Odom and Michael Olowokandi
had 16 points apiece for the Clippers, who also returned to the .500
mark with a 19-19 record.</TE>
<TE>   There would be no repeat of Friday's debacle at Charlotte, when
the Clippers squandered an eight-point lead in the final 1:25 of
regulation and lost in overtime, 92-91, to the Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   Pride took hold of the Clippers and wouldn't let go Sunday, not
even after they fell behind by 10 points in the first quarter. The
Clippers unleashed a matchup zone on the Raptors and reaped the
rewards with a 12-0 run that took them from a 29-19 deficit to a
31-29 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers lost the lead several times, the last after Toronto's
Alvin Williams made a three-point basket for a 51-50 Raptor lead
early in the third. But Eric Piatkowski promptly sank a three-pointer
and Olowokandi made a hook shot and the Clippers never trailed again.</TE>
<TE>   When things got tight late, the Clippers remained strong. Earl
Boykins made two free throws with 23.9 seconds remaining to give the
Clippers a 79-72 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never concentrated that much with my team up five," said
Boykins, who made only one of two free throws Friday with the
Clippers ahead by two points with 23.3 seconds to play in regulation.
"I was concentrating like we were losing. I knew if I made both, we
would make it a three-possession game."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the Raptors failed to draw any closer.</TE>
<TE>   "It says a lot about the character of this team," said Elton
Brand, who had only 12 points, but took 15 rebounds. "We could have
come here and fallen into a funk. I couldn't believe the Charlotte
game. I was thinking about it all that night."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry thought a great deal about Friday's game too.
But he revisited a different game than Brand and the other Clipper
players. Gentry watched a videotape of the Raptors' overtime victory
against the Atlanta Hawks several times.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry noticed that Atlanta rallied against Toronto by playing a
matchup zone, keeping Carter on the perimeter and holding him to 16
points. It worked again Sunday, although Carter had better success
against the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   However, Carter's teammates turned into the gang that couldn't
shoot straight after building a 10-point lead by the end of the first
quarter. Among the bricklayers were Antonio Davis, who was five for
13, and Alvin Williams (three for 13). Carter and Davis, who had 10
points, were the only Raptors to score in double figures.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper reserves outscored the Raptor reserves, 26-7.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to contest every shot when we went to the matchup zone,"
Brand said. "If the NBA is going to allow it [the zone defense],
we're going to employ it."</TE>
<TE>   Of Carter, Brand said: "Hey, the guy could get 70 as long as we
win the game."</TE>
<TE>   Carter had seven of the Raptors' 11 points in the fourth quarter.
The Clippers weren't a good deal better, scoring only 12 in the final
12 minutes. But the Clippers had the edge after three quarters,
67-61, and kept their composure down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   When the Clippers faltered slightly in the third quarter, they
went to an unlikely source for offense: Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   No one else was scoring, so the Clippers fed the ball to
Olowokandi on the low block and he responded with 10 points on
five-of-six shooting in the third. He also took three rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   With starting point guard Jeff McInnis ineffective because of a
stomach virus, Gentry turned to Boykins to lead the Clippers for
extended minutes. Boykins had eight of his 12 points in the first
half, but the biggest two came on his late free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great win, especially after the disaster in
Charlotte," Gentry said. "The Charlotte loss was devastating. To
bounce back and win any kind of road game is great for us."</TE>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Jeff McInnis didn't feel so hot Sunday, but he still started his 38th
game of the season. McInnis played only 25 minutes against the
Toronto Raptors because of a stomach virus, missed all six of his
shots and failed to score.</LD>
<LD>   Corey Maggette wasn't about to sit out another game and he
returned to the floor after missing Friday's game against the
Charlotte Hornets because of a strained right knee. He had five
points in 13 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise it was business as usual for the Clippers, who continue
to forge ahead despite numerous illnesses and ailments.</LD>
<TE>   "We stuck him in there," Coach Alvin Gentry said of McInnis.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry then stuck with backup point guard Earl Boykins for the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We switched Earl in there and he was going good, so we kept him
in the mix," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry used Maggette to give Lamar Odom about a 10-second rest at
one point in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Both players are expected to play Tuesday, when the Clippers
complete their six-game trip with a game against the Minnesota
Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' meltdown Friday against the Hornets weighed heavily
on their minds Saturday and Sunday. Gentry was uncertain how they
would respond after a 92-91 overtime loss when they faced Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he was pleased with the Clippers' resiliency.</TE>
<TE>   "We showed resolve and toughness," he said. "We could have easily
come here and been devastated and laid down and gone through the
motions, but we didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi put it this way: "The loss itself got us
over the hump [Sunday]. Everybody who cares enough about our team
knew we had to make amends."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Coach Lenny Wilkens wasn't the least bit surprised when
the Clippers switched from a man-to-man defense to a zone to start
the second quarter..</TE>
<TE>   "Having seen so many zones, we know where we are supposed to be,"
Wilkens said. "We want to force things and make it happen instead of
letting it come to us. It's not that we can't shoot the ball, the
guys aren't executing."</TE>
<TE>   By game's end, the Raptors had only 13 assists, a season low.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Monday Night Mayhem"</LD>
<LD>   Where: TNT, tonight, 9</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's no "Monday Night Football" tonight, but there is "Monday
Night Mayhem." This made-for-cable TV movie, based on a 1988 book
written by Bill Carter and Marc Gunther, examines "Monday Night
Football" during the Howard Cosell years, 1970-84.</TE>
<TE>   The book was good, the movie isn't. It appears to be cheaply made
and the characters, particularly Frank Gifford and Don Meredith, are
not believable. John Turturro does a decent job portraying Cosell,
but his performance isn't enough to save the movie.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't come close to matching a documentary HBO did a couple
of years ago titled "Cosell." The HBO show was real, this TNT show
isn't. It's the same reason an "Ali" documentary would undoubtedly be
better than the current movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Monday Night Mayhem" is not as boring as the previous Monday game
on ABC between the Minnesota Vikings and Baltimore Ravens, but it
lacks depth. It jumps from topic to topic, trying to cover all that
was in the book, without delving into anything substantial, without
really developing the characters.</TE>
<TE>   The Cosell portrayed in the movie has an ego and can be difficult
at times. But he comes across as a somewhat sympathetic character.</TE>
<TE>   The book reveals a Cosell consumed by a warped view of his own
self-importance and someone who always had to belittle others. The
movie touches on what the real Cosell was like but doesn't go far
enough.</TE>
<TE>   John Heard plays Roone Arledge, no easy task. The real Arledge was
an enigma, and the Arledge in this movie is one too.</TE>
<TE>   One might wonder why this movie isn't on ABC, the home of "Monday
Night Football." Executive producer Leslie Greif said it was never
pitched to ABC. "By going to a network like Turner, we didn't have to
deal with any of the politics that we might have dealt with had we
gone to ABC, where it would involve its own history, personalties and
egos," Greif told Entertainment Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   It could also be argued that this movie is not network quality.</TE>

<HD>From Shaq to Salchows, Here's News With a Twist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A recap of the news while on the mend after watching a bad martial
arts movie ("Shaq-Fu") and missing on my fourth attempt at a
quadruple salchow (with a lime twist).</LD>
<LD>   News item: Shaquille O'Neal goes bull-istic in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: There haven't been so many held breaths in
Lakerdom since Chick Hearn was rolled into surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Good thing Shaq whiffed on that first haymaker directed at Brad
Miller or this could have been the sequel to Kermit Washington vs.
Rudy Tomjanovich. It was that close, folks, to being that ugly.</TE>
<TE>   A few observations: Yes, Shaq gets hammered more than Dennis

<HD>With Dunleavy's Help, Duke Routs N.C. State</HD>
<DH>College basketball: He scores 15 consecutive points as No.
2 Blue Devils improve to 14-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The top scoring team in the Atlantic Coast Conference was looking for
anything to get away from the hounding defense thrown up by North
Carolina State.</LD>
<LD>   Second-ranked Duke found it in Mike Dunleavy.</LD>
<LD>   Dunleavy scored 15 consecutive points in a 23-2 run to close the
first half and Duke rolled to a 76-57 victory Sunday night.</LD>
<TE>   "It took something incredible like that to get that working margin
because we were not playing that much more differently
performance-wise than N.C. State," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said.
"We just had a kid who made separation for us."</TE>
<TE>   Duke (14-1, 3-1) beat N.C. State for the 11th time in a row and
16th in the last 17 meetings to halt any thoughts that the defending
national champions were vulnerable following their first loss a week
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Dunleavy had 22 points, seven rebounds, three assists and three
steals in the opening 20 minutes--outscoring the Wolfpack by one--and
finished with a career-high 27 points on 10-for-18 shooting. His
previous best was 25 points against San Diego State two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We were real stagnant there for a while," Dunleavy said. "We just
couldn't break it open and Jason [Williams] was out of the game for a
little bit and I said, 'I'm going to try and be a little bit more
aggressive here.' I made a couple in a row inside the arc and I just
got it going. After you make a few and a few after that it gets real
easy."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Boozer added 22 points for Duke.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Powell led the Wolfpack (12-4, 2-2) with 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils fell from the nation's top ranking after a
one-point loss at Florida State last Sunday, but rebounded with
impressive wins over Georgia Tech and the Wolfpack while No. 1 Kansas
lost to UCLA on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That combination could push the Blue Devils back to No. 1 in the
Associated Press poll--where they had been all season prior to the
loss to the Seminoles.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like we played a pretty good 30 minutes against Georgia
Tech and we came out with a lot of energy, but we didn't play a full
40 and that's what we wanted to do tonight," Dunleavy said. "We
really built on that. We were good for 39. So, it's not yet perfect
but we're on our way."</TE>
<TE>   N.C. State had won seven of eight, including road wins over
Syracuse and Virginia, both top-10 teams.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 19,722 was on hand to watch the biggest ACC matchup of
the season and see how far the Wolfpack program had come.</TE>
<TE>   N.C. State matched up with Duke for the opening 10 minutes, giving
the Blue Devils some problems with its press and harassing them into
poor shot selection.</TE>
<TE>   Then the roof caved in for the Wolfpack. After starting six for 11
from the field, they went close to nine minutes without a basket.</TE>

<LD>A tale of two Southern California hockey teams.</LD>
<LD>   During the summer of 2000:</LD>
<LD>   The Kings signed defenseman Mathieu Schneider as a free agent and
improved the power play. He finished with 51 points and the Kings
made the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks signed German Titov, who seemed to be easing into
retirement with a $4.6-million buyout. The Ducks finished last in the
Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2000-01 season:</TE>
<TE>   The Kings traded defenseman Rob Blake, their most popular player,
to Colorado for forward Adam Deadmarsh and defenseman Aaron Miller.
Both were key components in the Kings' playoff run and their current
surge.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks traded popular forward Teemu Selanne for forward Jeff
Friesen and goalie Steve Shields. They are key components in the
Ducks going from 15th place last season to 14th place today.</TE>
<TE>   This season:</TE>
<TE>   The Kings traded for Boston center Jason Allison. It cost them
Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray, but they landed a first-line center.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who balked at a trade for Allison in August, traded for
Minnesota's Sergei Krivokrasov. It cost them virtually nothing, but
Krivokrasov has been a healthy scratch in 13 of the last 14 games.
Steve Rucchin, who is supposed to be their first-line center, is once
again missing a large chunk of the season because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The King lost Schneider and standout forward Ziggy Palffy to
injuries for an extended period, yet had the depth to hold things
together.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks lost Rucchin and Keith Carney, their top defenseman, and
fell further off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were six points out of first place in the Pacific
Division after beating San Jose on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were three points ahead of Columbus, the conference's
last-place team, after losing to Nashville on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Lighting Up the Eclipse Awards</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The finalists for the Eclipse Awards, horse racing's version of the
Oscars, were revealed late last week and the winners will be
announced Feb. 18 at a resort hotel in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   There was never any doubt Point Given would be one of the
candidates for horse of the year, and although his career ended
prematurely some 41/2 months ago, he deserves to be presented with
the sport's biggest honor.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corporation and
trained by Bob Baffert, the chestnut son of Thunder Gulch did more
than enough during his seven-race campaign to merit the edge over
Tiznow.</LD>
<TE>   Apart from his mysterious disappearance in the Kentucky Derby,
Point Given was perfect in 2001, winning six races, including
two-thirds of the Triple Crown, the Haskell Invitational, the Santa
Anita Derby and the Travers.</TE>
<TE>   His Belmont Stakes was arguably the most visually impressive race
run by any horse last year and he was able to win the Haskell at
Monmouth Park when he didn't run anywhere close to his best.</TE>
<TE>   Tiznow, meanwhile, was only a .500 hitter in 2001, winning three
of six.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Breeders' Cup Classic, he won the Santa Anita Handicap
and the San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   There's no denying Jay Robbins did a masterful training job with
the son of Cee's Tizzy, who looked headed for retirement in late
spring, and the 4-year-old's second consecutive win in the Breeders'
Cup Classic was stirring, but the numbers clearly say Point Given is
the right choice.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the opinions on the other Eclipse Awards:</TE>
<TE>   2-Year-Old--Johannesburg. The colt was perfect in six starts in
England, France and Ireland, then made a successful transition to the
main track and was the clever winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.</TE>
<TE>   How the Hennessy colt does in the Triple Crown remains to be seen,
but he was clearly best Oct. 27 at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   2-Year-Old Filly--Tempera. She bombed in the Del Mar Debutante,
but rebounded nicely with an upset win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile
Fillies. Trained by Eoin Harty for Godolphin Racing, Tempera had the
advantage of racing on the preferred outside part of the track that
day in New York while Bella Bellucci, who entered the Juvenile
Fillies perfect in two starts, was trapped on the inside.</TE>
<TE>   3-Year-Old--Point Given. There are no finalists except him and
that's the way it should be. He towered over his division and how
great would it have been to see him face Tiznow and Sakhee in the
Breeders' Cup Classic.</TE>
<TE>   3-Year-Old Filly--Xtra Heat. Yes, she is strictly a sprinter, but
what a sprinter she is. She won nine of 13 last year and hasn't lost
in 11 starts at six furlongs. Trained by John Salzman, she nearly
beat the boys in the Breeders' Cup Sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Older Male--Tiznow. When he lost to Freedom Crest and Skimming in
the Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita early in October,
this award did not seem possible for the California-bred.</TE>
<TE>   However, he stepped his game up in New York and won another
hard-fought Breeders' Cup Classic, again edging a classy European
(Sakhee). A year ago, he got the best of Giant's Causeway.</TE>
<TE>   Older Female--Tranquility Lake. To be perfectly frank, nobody is
truly deserving in a division where they took turns beating each
other. Tranquility Lake, at least, was a graded stakes winner on turf
and dirt.</TE>
<TE>   In the Clement L. Hirsch Handicap at Del Mar, she easily handled
Gourmet Girl, also a finalist in this category, and Spain, the other
finalist, only won once in nine starts last year.</TE>
<TE>   Male Turf Horse--Fantastic Light. When he scored in the Turf,
Fantastic Light became the only winning favorite on the Breeders' Cup
card and he capped a tremendous year--and career--with a victory at a
distance that wasn't even his best.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinter--Squirtle Squirt. The son of Marquetry gave trainer Bobby
Frankel his first Breeders' Cup victory in the Sprint and, for the
first time in his career, came from off the pace to win. There were
some saying Caller One, Xtra Heat or Kona Gold could have staked
their claim to the championship if one of them had won the recent
$300,000 Frank J. De Francis Memorial Dash at Laurel, but the bottom
line is, they all failed and all of them had their shot at Squirtle
Squirt in the Breeders' Cup and he was the best that afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey--Jerry Bailey. This is almost becoming a tradition. Bailey,
who had a Breeders' Cup win with Squirtle Squirt, was the runaway
leader in earnings, totaling a record of nearly $23 million.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer--Frankel. He ended his Breeders' Cup winless streak and
won stakes--and Grade I's--in bunches throughout the year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With a breeding to Storm Cat, the most expensive stallion in the
country, in the offing, Tout Charmant probably ran herself into
another year of racing Sunday by winning the $150,000 San Gorgonio
Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   That's all right with trainer Ron McAnally, who said that if Tout
Charmant rebounds effectively from the 11/8-mile grass race, she will
probably remain in training.</LD>
<LD>   Her owners, Bob and Janice McNair, would breed another of their
mares to Storm Cat, who stands at Overbrook Farm in Lexington, Ky.,
for a listed stud fee of $500,000.</LD>
<TE>   A year ago at this time, Tout Charmant had a serious case of
colic, but recovered after an operation in which her small colon was
put back in place. She didn't return to the races until September,
and finished no better than fourth in three starts. The San Gorgonio
was the 6-year-old mare's first victory since she won the Palomar
Handicap at Hollywood Park in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Tout Charmant, bred by Bob and Barbara Walter, was bought
privately from them by the McNairs two years ago. Overall, she has
eight wins and nine seconds in 26 starts, with earnings of $1.7
million.</TE>
<TE>   McAnally said that the Walters, who had had a falling out with
Tout Charmant's original trainer, Bob Baffert, insisted on a trainer
switch before they would sell the mare.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the Walters, but I had never trained one horse for them,"
McAnally said.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason they wanted the horse sent to me after she was
sold. It was like the John Henry story--one morning the phone rang
and suddenly I had a new horse."</TE>
<TE>   McAnally's fifth win in the San Gorgonio--the first came with Miss
Magnetic in 1980--was also his 100th stakes win at Santa Anita winter
meets. Chris McCarron, who rode Tout Charmant, has been aboard for
three of McAnally's San Gorgonio wins. Tout Charmant was in second
place, behind favored Dancingonice, when she made her move at the
head of the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "When I had the opportunity to put her in the clear, she took off
like a European horse and just sailed ahead," McCarron said. "I'm
glad the move wasn't premature."</TE>
<TE>   The second choice in the betting and carrying high weight of 120
pounds, Tout Charmant paid $7 for $2, winning in a time of 1:47 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Janet was second, beaten by two lengths and one length better than
Vencera, the third-place finisher.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on the card, the Baffert-trained Popular, who was beaten
by 15 lengths on opening day, nipped favored Roman Dancer by a nose
in the $107,900 San Miguel Stakes for 3-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert has won the Kentucky Derby twice, but one of his top
candidates this year, China Grind, apparently will not be considered
for Churchill Downs on May 4.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob said that he just wants to take his time with this colt,"
said Jim Barnes, Baffert's assistant. China Grind, a son of
Grindstone, the 1996 Derby winner, beat maidens in his debut at
Hollywood Park on Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   He reportedly has not been nominated for the Triple Crown races.</TE>

<LD>Their 3-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Saturday continued an
explosive run by the Kings that probably saved their season.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 8, the Kings fell a season-high six games below .500 after
losing to the Blues, 2-0, at St. Louis in the first game of a
make-or-break 18-game stretch that would include 13 games on the
road.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, they are 11-3-3--8-2-2 on the road. Saturday's victory
capped a 4-1 trip, matching a record for the best five-game trip in
club history.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a [stretch] that we really needed to do well on," Mathieu
Schneider said. "We were at a crossroads in our season, where we
could stay in the playoff hunt or bow out of it because everybody
above us seemed to keep winning."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who play five of their next six games at Staples
Center, have climbed to within one point of the faltering Calgary
Flames in the race for the final Western Conference playoff slot.</TE>
<TE>   "We just tried not to get too far ahead of ourselves and just play
the game that we have to play and take it from there," Coach Andy
Murray said. "And until somebody tells us, 'You don't have a chance
to make the playoffs anymore,' that's the only way to look at it. We
put an emphasis on every game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still disappointed that we lost six or seven games earlier in
the year that we should have won, so I'm not ready to pat anybody on
the back yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get it done, and then we'll talk in good terms about it.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coach, obviously you appreciate what's gone on here of late,
but there's so much more work to be done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Felix Potvin's 39 saves Saturday were nine more than his previous
season high. His career high is 55, in a 4-2 victory for the New York
Islanders over the New Jersey Devils on April 12, 1999.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson's return to Chicago went nothing as he'd hoped.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers lost in overtime, Shaquille O'Neal threw a breezy punch
that'll cost him maybe five games, and Jackson wasn't able to see
good friend John Lithgow, in town doing a play.</LD>
<LD>   That being said, the electric purple tie was worth the visit.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Chicago always seems to set the typically unsentimental
Jackson to thinking, and this time it was about his coaching
mortality. Halfway through the five-year, $30-million contract he
signed with Jerry Buss, and having turned 56 in September, Jackson
said he would serve, "Probably until the end of this contract."</TE>
<TE>   If he is serious, that would give the Lakers 21/2 years to come up
with a new coach and a new center. O'Neal reiterated that he'd follow
Jackson to retirement, though probably not to Montana.</TE>
<TE>   "If Phil leaves in two years, then Mr. O'Neal leaves in two
years," O'Neal said. "I will not play for any other coach."</TE>
<TE>   He would retire at 32, then, and with $61.9 million left on his
contract.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Oakley, 24 hours before O'Neal arrived in Chicago: "I
ain't going to be no railroad track for him to just run all over me.
I've guarded him before because, as everybody knows, I'm a pretty
good defensive center. It's a challenge. It's like trying to move a
tank.</TE>
<TE>   "But I can't understand why everybody's so scared of Shaq. I've
never seen more NBA players scared of one man. To me, it's part of
the job, and I never back down from any challenge."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have lost eight games, three to teams that were in last
place in their divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Also, four of the losses were in the second of back-to-back games.</TE>
<TE>   In order, they lost to Memphis when the Grizzlies were last in the
Midwest Division, the Golden State Warriors of the Pacific Division,
and the Bulls, last in the Central Division.</TE>

<HD>Lakers in His Corner</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They speak out and defend O'Neal's actions
during Saturday's game with Chicago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Shaquille O'Neal awoke Sunday in Beverly Hills with an ounce of
regret, it was not for the punch he threw the night before in
Chicago, but for the necessity of it.</LD>
<LD>   Who would protect Shaq, if not Shaq?</LD>
<LD>   In that moment, he chose himself. If not the NBA leadership, if
not its referees, then him, with a fist the size of a cantaloupe sent
whistling past another man's head, with terrible intentions.</LD>
<TE>   It appears now that the Laker center has put an entire league on
notice; he no longer will take cheap shots, he will defend himself,
and he will hurt back.</TE>
<TE>   He called it "a raggedy ... league" last week for exactly this
reason, because of what he perceives as a double standard in
assessing fouls. The guard nudged 25 feet from the basket goes to the
free-throw line and he, slashed across the wrists beneath the rim,
does not.</TE>
<TE>   The relative violence of the fouls against O'Neal is next to
impossible to quantify. But the hack by Brad Miller in Saturday's
fourth quarter was the first flagrant foul assessed against an
opponent on O'Neal this season, and there have been dozens of harder
fouls. There were a handful harder Saturday night alone, when Charles
Oakley, Miller and the young Bulls chopped and hacked with little
regard for the proximity of the basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in the first half they were coming way too hard to foul
him," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "The referees never warned them.
They never said, 'OK guys, cut it down, that's a little excessive.'
Just to say a word, is what we need to hear. What the league does not
want to see is Shaq explode and break somebody's face up."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the organization has been in contact with the league
office, to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times can we do it?" he said. "We do it all the time. We
don't complain because we don't whine. But we say, 'That's too hard.'
I told the referees the first half, 'That's too hard. That's
excessive contact.'"</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak said Sunday he would ask the
league's Competition Committee to examine the way O'Neal is
officiated. It meets again in February, during All-Star weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure we're heard as an organization," Kupchak
said. "Here's a man who clearly is subjected physically to this every
time he catches the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, O'Neal, who imposes a violent game as well, will find
it all too typical that he will be the one punished. That
announcement, from league disciplinarian Stu Jackson, is expected
today, for at least a game and probably more. He is likely to miss
Saturday's game at San Antonio. Miller, Oakley and Ron Artest of the
Bulls also could be assessed suspensions or fines, though they are
expected to be less severe than O'Neal's.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about the suspension or the money," Laker guard Brian
Shaw said. "It's about the respect. You can be physical, but you have
to be clean. As big and strong as he is, when he does it it's always
in self-defense. You never see him go over and try to take somebody's
head off. As big and strong as he is, if he did that, somebody would
really get hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to restrain himself every day. A lot of fouls for
everybody else are not going to be fouls to him. He accepts that for
the most part. But if it's a foul, it's a foul, regardless of how
strong the guy is."</TE>
<TE>   Bull General Manager Jerry Krause, Jackson's former boss, said the
Lakers had no right to complain, that the higher standard comes with
a superstar player.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if he takes a beating," he said. "Michael [Jordan]
took a beating every night. Wilt [Chamberlain] took a beating every
night. Bill Russell took a beating every night. All great players,
particularly when you're a great inside player, give and take
poundings. When you're a great player it just comes with the
territory."</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson said in training camp that the three-peat season was
more difficult than attempting to win the first or the second, he did
not mention O'Neal by name. Though O'Neal was healing from surgery on
the small toe of his left foot, Jackson could not have foretold
O'Neal's trying season.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal declared "[Mess] with Shaq Week" when his public spat with
Jackson was followed by the league's fine for having excessively long
shorts. It became "Mess with Shaq Month" when both of his feet began
to ache, an ailment that forced him to the injured list Christmas
Day.</TE>
<TE>   Today, when the suspension and fine come down, O'Neal surely will
believe it to be "Mess with Shaq Season," and it is not yet midway
through January.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, O'Neal has been playful and charming through most of
the difficult moments, though he talks of early retirement more often
than ever. It is his nature, generally, to be upbeat, and he was
delighted in November by the birth of his fourth child, a daughter
named Amirah Sanaa.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal also has been remarkable for his restraint. Players of
lesser skill and heft, players such as Miller and Oakley, long have
employed their six fouls as weapons against O'Neal, 7 feet 1 and 341
pounds. And O'Neal has understood, though with a predictable disdain
for those clumsy methods.</TE>
<TE>   His poor free-throw percentage has enabled the strategy. The
overzealous, meantime, were protected by O'Neal's promises--to
himself, to his coach, to his father and mother--to resist
retaliation. He came to believe he was the world's only football
player to engage in four games a week, and to perform unpadded as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing can harm Superman, after all, and isn't that the tattoo on
his biceps? And isn't that the theme music played at Staples Center?
And isn't that the logo on the grilles of his car?</TE>
<TE>   Often, O'Neal would lower his head, raise his eyes and trudge to
the free-throw line. Not the last time, however.</TE>
<TE>   He chased Miller to the baseline and rolled an overhand right that
nicked Miller's ear.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'You should be able to take that,'" Laker forward
Samaki Walker said. "It's like when you're growing up, they say,
'Well, you're big, you should be able to take that.'</TE>
<TE>   "There were some plays early in the game he complained about. He
told them that they were roughing him up. That play there, it got
carried away. I couldn't say that I would handle the situation any
different. That was a situation that could have injured him. He's got
to stand up for himself."</TE>

<HD>DeVos Decides It's Time to Sell His Magic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orlando Magic owner Rich DeVos is putting the franchise up for sale,
saying he's "wearing down," the Orlando Sentinel reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   DeVos told the newspaper that he can't guarantee the team's new
owner will keep the club in Orlando.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't ask him to do anything," DeVos said. "I don't see any
reason why he would want to leave Orlando. Where are you going and
what's the rationale of that?"</LD>
<TE>   Magic officials wouldn't comment on a sale, but planned to hold a
news conference today.</TE>
<TE>   DeVos, who made his fortune as co-founder of Amway Corp., has
owned the Magic since 1991, but he claims the team is losing about
$10 million annually because its current arena lacks moneymaking
amenities, such as mid-level suites.</TE>
<TE>   DeVos, 76, said he has been planning to sell the team for about a
year. He said his age and his health--he had a heart transplant four
years ago--played a part in his decision, along with estate planning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time," he said. "I've had a wonderful run. I've had a ball."</TE>
<TE>   The team has battled with Orlando and Orange County officials over
a new arena, estimated to cost $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Government leaders repeatedly have told the team that the money
isn't available.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the county predicted that $79.2 million would be
available by 2006 for a new arena--less than two-thirds of what the
Magic sought.</TE>
<TE>   And the county's financial projection came before the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, which hurt the region's tourism industry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 2-year-old daughter of Portland Trail Blazer center Dale Davis
was released from the hospital after having open-heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is fine. Everything went well," Davis said before
Sunday night's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   Caida Davis was born with a hole in her heart, and a surgeon
repaired it Thursday in Atlanta, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Caida lives in the city with her mother.</TE>

<HD>Webber Keeps Kings on a Roll</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when Chris Webber's balky ankle got close to full strength, two
of his fellow starters went down with injuries.</LD>
<LD>   No matter: Webber's ankle and his growing enthusiasm have been
strong enough to move the Sacramento Kings to the top of the Pacific
Division.</LD>
<LD>   Webber had 28 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists, and the Kings
won their eighth in a row, defeating the Phoenix Suns, 103-100,
Sunday night at Sacramento to catch the Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a good win just because there's no love lost between these
two teams," Webber said. "The fact that we didn't fall prey to all
the distractions, I think that was the most important thing we
accomplished tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento (27-9) moved into a virtual tie with the Lakers (26-8),
who have led the division all season despite the Kings' best start in
franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   With two consecutive losses by the Lakers and Shaquille O'Neal's
impending suspension for fighting, the Kings believe they might be
able to make a move--not that anyone in Sacramento's locker room
would admit to it with Webber listening.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm worried about is us watching and looking at the Lakers,
and then losing to somebody else in the first round," Webber said.
"None of this really matters until the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings improved to an NBA-best 20-1 at home with their 13th
consecutive victory at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix got 33 points from Stephon Marbury but lost for the sixth
time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic had 25 points for the Kings, and Bobby Jackson
scored 18 filling in at point guard for Mike Bibby, who is nursing a
sprained knee. Vlade Divac also sat out for the Kings with a sprained
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Penny Hardaway had 11 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for the
Suns, and Rodney Rogers had 24 points and eight rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 96, Cleveland 64--Bonzi Wells scored 18 points and the
Trail Blazers used a 19-0 third-quarter run at Portland, Ore., to
rout the Cavaliers for the second time in a week.</TE>
<TE>   Scottie Pippen scored 13 points, Damon Stoudamire had 11 assists
and Rasheed Wallace had 11 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who have
won three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Lamond Murray scored 16 points for the Cavaliers, who lost their
sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Portland defeated Cleveland by 26 points last Monday, but they
fell behind in the opening minutes Sunday before going on a 14-2 run.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley Person made a three-point basket to rally the Cavaliers
within 45-41.</TE>
<TE>   But Wallace, who had missed his previous six shots, started the
19-0 run with a 22-foot jumper.</TE>
<TE>   Wells made two consecutive three-pointers and Dale Davis made a
mid-range jumper. Stoudamire then found Pippen for a wide-open
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive points during the run were scored by Pippen.
With the shot clock ticking down, Stoudamire flipped him the ball and
Pippen tossed it over his head and off the glass for a 64-41 lead.</TE>

<KH>NCAA CONVENTION</KH>
<HD>Huma Says Group Not Deterred</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The head of a student-athlete advocacy group said a rebuff by the
NCAA was a "revealing development" that would not deter recruiting
efforts.</LD>
<LD>   Ramogi Huma, chairman of the Collegiate Athletes Coalition, said
Sunday that the cancellation of a scheduled meeting showed the NCAA
did not take his group seriously in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   NCAA President Cedric Dempsey said during the organization's
annual convention on Saturday that a Jan. 20 meeting was canceled
after the NCAA found out about the CAC's alliance with the United
Steelworkers. Dempsey also said the NCAA already has a process for
input from its Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if there's a next immediate move," said Huma, a
former UCLA linebacker. "We weren't sure how serious the NCAA was
about this meeting in the first place.... I think our next move is to
just keep on forming the players association."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Stratton, NCAA vice president of education services, said the
association takes the CAC seriously "in that we believe those issues
are real issues, and we've been trying to address them.... There's a
lot on student-athlete welfare we're still working on. We're not
done," Stratton said.</TE>
<TE>   The CAC, started about a year ago by a group of former and current
UCLA football players, wants the NCAA to establish and enforce safety
standards for voluntary and mandatory workouts, and require schools
to expand health- and life-insurance benefits for players. The
coalition has several hundred members at eight colleges, seven of
them in the Pacific 10.</TE>
<TE>   It was featured last week on the CBS program "60 Minutes." During
the telecast, United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard called the
NCAA a "sweatshop."</TE>
<TE>   Huma said he would not use that description. "But I recognize and
student-athletes recognize that student-athletes--between football
and basketball--are generating about $3 billion a year, and at the
same time lack basic protections."</TE>

<HD>Packers Prove Lambeau Laws</HD>
<DH>NFC: Green Bay's 25-15 victory against San Francisco
improves home playoff record to 11-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>At some point, the numbers cease to be mere streaks and trends, and
demand acceptance as law.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco 49ers had to play Brett Favre and the Green Bay
Packers in an NFC wild-card game at Lambeau Field on a 29-degree day.
That all but made Green Bay's 25-15 victory Sunday inevitable. Then
it was a matter of updating the stats: the Packers are now 11-0 in
playoff games at Lambeau, and Favre is 31-0 when the temperature is
34 degrees or below.</LD>
<LD>   And when Favre plays the way he did in the second half Sunday, the
Packers are practically unbeatable no matter the stadium or climate.
Favre ripped the 49ers the way he did the Jaguars on a 56-degree
Monday night in Jacksonville in the fall, to cite one example.</LD>
<TE>   He completed 16 of 21 passes for 226 yards and a touchdown in the
final two quarters, allowing the Packers to regain the lead, pull
away and then make travel plans to St. Louis for a second-round
matchup with the Rams on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they can score 50 poses a little bit of a problem,"
Favre said of his next opponent. "The fact that we're playing on
turf, at their place ... "</TE>
<TE>   But don't take that as a lack of confidence. He's in full
gunslinger mode, unafraid of any situation and with complete belief
in his abilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I am playing my best football right now," Favre said.</TE>
<TE>   And Favre's best is about as good as it gets.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a quarterback can have a better game than he did
today," Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman said. "He took control of the
game and he willed it."</TE>
<TE>   When Sherman curiously decided to go for two points after a
Favre-to-Bubba Franks touchdown put the Packers ahead by eight points
in the third quarter (the conversion failed), Favre didn't join in
the sideline second-guessing.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Who gives a damn? Let's score another touchdown,'" Favre
said.</TE>
<TE>   When the 49ers tied the score, 15-15, on a touchdown pass and
two-point conversion three minutes into the fourth quarter, Favre
said "I was never afraid it was going to get away."</TE>
<TE>   He came right back by completing five of his next six passes to
move the Packers into field-goal range, and Ryan Longwell made a
45-yarder. On Green Bay's next possession, Favre went to Antonio
Freeman for 37 yards on third and seven. Later he pump-faked to his
left, pumped to his right, then passed to Donald Driver on third and
six to set up Ahman Green's nine-yard touchdown run that provided the
final margin.</TE>
<TE>   "[Favre] sees the whole field and all of the receivers when he's
hitting everybody," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Favre, who finished with 269 yards passing, two touchdowns
and an interception: "It's all about tempo and rhythm. "It's like a
fastbreak offense in basketball. You get in a rhythm. The only way
you get out of it is when you slow down and relax. You've got to go
and attack."</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay's defense attacked from the start, with Gilbert Brown
sacking quarterback Jeff Garcia on the first play and Cletidus Hunt
stopping running back Garrison Heart for a five-yard loss on the
second play.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers held the league's second-best rushing attack to only
71 yards (Hearst had 42 yards in 13 carries).</TE>
<TE>   The secondary allowed 49er wide receiver Tai Streets to catch four
passes for 50 yards and a touchdown, and even witnessed a
mini-resurrection of J.J. Stokes (four receptions, 52 yards). But
they held Terrell Owens to only 40 yards on four catches.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel like I had enough opportunities today," Owens said.
"It's very frustrating. I feel like the team has come a long way for
it to end like this."</TE>
<TE>   Owens actually beat Green Bay cornerback Mike McKenzie on a
pivotal play, but McKenzie caught up to a ball that was slightly
underthrown, batted it away and into the hands teammate Tyrone
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia wound up with 233 yards passing and a touchdown. But if he
had led Owens a little more on that play, Owens would have had a
touchdown and the 49ers would have been ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Favre executed the drive that led to Green's score, on a
nine-yard run in which he fought through a hit and took the ball
across the goal line as he landed on his back.</TE>
<TE>   So these modern-day Packers, who are in the playoffs for the first
time since 1998, upheld the winning ways of Lambeau. The Packers win
here under all circumstances, from the Ice Bowl of 1967 to Sunday's
unseasonably mild weather--but backed by another sellout crowd of
59,825.</TE>
<TE>   "We have built a big advantage over the years," said Favre, who
threw his 27th playoff touchdown pass Sunday to tie him with John
Elway for fourth place on the all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys who played here before have built a big advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Said McKenzie: "A lot of teams great teams have come out of that
tunnel. We're trying to put our stamp on Lambeau and show what we're
all about."</TE>
<TE>   If they showed anything Sunday, it's that what's past is prologue.</TE>

<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Sunday was a historic day, even for a stadium as steeped in tradition
as Lambeau Field.</LD>
<LD>   It was the last time the field will be used in its current
configuration for an NFL game. Although the Green Bay Packers
advanced to the next round of the playoffs, they will not play
another home game this postseason. So the next phase of the
$295-million renovation of Lambeau Field will begin in earnest; the
demolition of the press box begins Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Packers are adding 10,000 seats, more luxury boxes, a
two-level concourse, more bathrooms and concession stands and a
five-story museum and "Packers cultural center" called Titletown. The
renovations will require the team to change the route it uses to take
the field, which created some sentimental feelings for Coach Mike
Sherman.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the last time we're going to walk out that tunnel,"
Sherman said. "It was very special. All the great teams ... they have
gone in and out of that tunnel."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The play wound up having no effect on the outcome, but Sherman
took a lot of questions on his decision to go for two points after a
touchdown in the third quarter, when a one-point kick would have put
the Packers ahead by nine and prevented the 49ers from tying the
score on one possession. Brett Favre's pass to Donald Driver was
complete, but Driver was tackled short.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman said he wanted to get back on track after his team missed
an earlier extra point.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt very confident about our two-point play," Sherman said. "I
was thinking about going ahead by 10 points."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As if there wasn't enough talk about Green Bay's perfect home
record, Sherman had to hear about it from his oldest son.</TE>
<TE>   "They've won 10 in a row here," 12-year-old Matthew told him this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Thank you, Matthew,'" Sherman said. "He could work for
[the media]. He'll be asking me about that two-point call."</TE>

<LD>Philadelphia (11-5, 1-0)</LD>
<LD>   at Chicago (13-3, 0-0)</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, 1:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How they got here: Philadelphia routed Tampa Bay, 31-9, in a
wild-card playoff game. Chicago received a bye after winning the NFC
Central.</TE>
<TE>   2001 meetings: None. Bears lead the all-time series, 25-7-1, but
have lost the last two meetings, including a 13-9 loss at
Philadelphia in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   2001 common opponents: Philadelphia split its season series with
Arizona; Chicago beat Arizona, 20-13. Philadelphia beat Minnesota,
48-17; Chicago beat Minnesota twice, 17-10 and 13-6. Philadelphia
split its season series with Washington; Chicago beat Washington,
20-15. Philadelphia and Chicago each beat Tampa Bay twice.</TE>
<TE>   About Philadelphia: The Eagles will go as far as Donovan McNabb
takes them. "He makes everyone around him better and that's what you
have got to have going down the stretch." Tight end Chad Lewis said.
"He's got a lot of confidence. We feed off of that.... He is a great
leader for our team."</TE>
<TE>   About Chicago: The Bears have been the surprise of the NFL and
their defense gave up the fewest points of any team, allowing 13.2 a
game. They will be tested by McNabb, but they have passed every test
thrown their way this season.</TE>

seems motivated to reach the Super Bowl again. The matchup against
St. Louis will feature quarterbacks with five combined MVP trophies:
Favre has three, Kurt Warner two.</TE>
<TE>   About St. Louis: The Rams averaged a league-high 31.4 points a

<HD>Redskins Go to Fun 'N Gun</HD>
<DH>Pro football: After Schottenheimer is fired, Spurrier
agrees to five-year, $25-million contract to become Washington's
fourth coach in 13 months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS HARRY</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Steve Spurrier will be tossing a Washington Redskin visor next
season.</LD>
<LD>   Spurrier, who surprisingly resigned as University of Florida coach
on Jan. 4, has agreed to a record five-year, $25-million deal,
according to NFL sources, to become head coach of one of the league's
most tradition-rich franchises.</LD>
<LD>   Unavailable for comment Sunday night, the 56-year-old Spurrier is
expected to be announced as the Redskins' 25th coach--and fourth in
13 months--at a news conference perhaps as early as Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   To make way for Spurrier--the winningest coach in Florida history
at 122-27-1 in 12 seasons--the Redskins' billionaire owner Dan Snyder
fired Marty Schottenheimer Sunday night. Schottenheimer had completed
only one season of a four-year, $10-million contract. Snyder will owe
Schottenheimer all of the $7.5 million remaining on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   After starting the season 0-5, the Redskins rallied to an 8-8
finish, but lost three December home games after clawing back into
the playoff chase. The Redskin offense was ranked 30th among 31 teams
and scored fewer points than all but three teams.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Snyder gave Schottenheimer total control of football
operations. The two disagreed on several personnel decisions,
however, prompting Snyder to exercise a clause in Schottenheimer's
contract allowing for the coach's player-personnel and
general-manager duties to be taken away.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder also wanted Schottenheimer to make changes in the coaching
staff to spice up the offense, but the coach balked at that request,
citing a clause that gave him autonomy over his assistant coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder, whose net worth has been estimated at more than $2.2
billion, ended the stalemate by firing Schottenheimer.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Schottenheimer gave 100% of his efforts to the Redskins and
made positive contributions to the team," Snyder said. "Our decision
was a difficult one and was based on philosophical and management
issues, not on coaching ability."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the conservative Redskin offense will be turned over to
Spurrier, whose trademarks at Florida were his dazzling Fun 'N Gun
offense, an arrogance and swagger that prompted the nickname "Coach
Superior" and an ever-present visor.</TE>
<TE>   In his Jan. 7 farewell news conference in Gainesville, Fla.,
Spurrier spoke of a longtime desire to see if his innovative
offense--not to mention his sometimes controversial methods--could
work in the grandest football arena.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm intrigued to see if my style of offense, my style of
coaching, can be successful at the NFL level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to find that out before I completely hang it up. Before I
call my last play."</TE>
<TE>   In that same news conference, Spurrier said he wanted to work with
a solid player personnel department. With Schottenheimer's exit,
Snyder will also have to hire a general manager with whom he is
compatible.</TE>
<TE>   One name that could surface in the next few days is Tampa Bay's
Rich McKay, who along with Coach Tony Dungy is expected to be fired
this week and be replaced by former New York Giant-New England
Patriot-New York Jet coach Bill Parcells.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates include former Redskin general manager Bobby
Beathard, former Packer GM Ron Wolf, and former Redskin director of
player personnel Vinny Cerrato, who was fired by Schottenheimer.</TE>
<TE>   Once his family, staff and the positions around him are settled,
Spurrier will turn his attention to what he does best--calling
football plays.</TE>
<TE>   "He's won all his life, and he's not going to stop now," Florida
Athletic Director Jeremy Foley said. "His new fans are getting a guy
who's creative on offense, as competitive as anyone I've ever met,
who hates to lose and loves to win. He also loves to have fun. We had
fun for 12 years. Now, it's someone else's turn."</TE>

<HD>Modano Continues His Scoring Spree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Modano didn't have to think too long to remember the last time
he was scoring goals in bunches.</LD>
<LD>   "Three weeks ago," the 13-year NHL veteran said.</LD>
<LD>   Modano scored two goals Sunday night at St. Paul, Minn., leading
the Dallas Stars to a 3-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild.</LD>
<TE>   Modano, who scored twice in a 5-2 loss to Detroit on Saturday
night, has nine goals in his last six games and 26 for the season,
which ties him for second in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Modano also scored in six consecutive games from Dec. 2-15.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't try to analyze things or think too much," Modano said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to ride the streak and have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Modano is on pace to match his career-high of 50 goals, set in
1993-94.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't scored more than 38 goals in a season since.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been getting a lot of breaks lately, and the only difference
is I've been capitalizing on it," Modano said.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Belfour, who recently criticized Coach Ken Hitchcock for his
frequent use of backup Marty Turco, made 25 saves and had a shutout
for two periods en route to his third victory in four starts.</TE>
<TE>   Turco had won seven consecutive starts before losing to Detroit on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Modano and Belfour were the best players on the ice tonight,"
Hitchcock said. "When Belfour is aggressive, he seems to play very
well. The way he's playing right now is the way we need him to play
down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 2, Atlanta 2--Even after squandering a two-goal lead
against the lowest-scoring team in the league, the Thrashers were
happy with a tie.</TE>
<TE>   Fredrik Modin scored a power-play goal with 12 minutes left in the
third period to rally the Lightning to a tie at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Thrashers, who had their two-game winning streak ended,
extended their home unbeaten streak to a franchise-record three
games.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta dominated play in overtime, but failed to convert several
scoring chances.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a couple of good chances in the overtime, but we couldn't
buy one," goaltender Milan Hnilicka said.</TE>
<TE>   "A tie is, I guess I shouldn't say OK, especially when we were up
2-0, but we've got to be happy with the tie."</TE>

<HD>It Takes Time, but Kelly Gets His Victory</HD>
<DH>Golf: He shoots an even-par 70 to beat Cook by one stroke
for his first win in 200 starts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Given a fourth chance to win on the PGA Tour, Jerry Kelly wasn't
about to give the Sony Open away to anyone Sunday--least of all John
Cook.</LD>
<LD>   Tentative throughout the final round, Kelly produced two flawless
swings to set up a two-putt birdie on the final hole for a one-stroke
victory over Cook, giving him his first PGA Tour victory in his 200th
career start.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to sleep for a week," said Kelly, who closed with
an even-par 70 on a balmy day at Waialae Country Club when no one
made much of a move.</LD>
<TE>   It was the fourth time Kelly had the lead going into the final
round. One of those chances came last year at the Reno-Tahoe Open,
when he made triple bogey on the 16th hole of the final round,
allowing Cook to win by a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   There were no such mistakes Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly disposed of an early threat by David Toms, made a clutch par
save on the 15th and then overcame a three-putt bogey on No. 17 with
his two most important swings. His three-wood split the middle of the
fairway, and he easily reached the green on the 551-yard closing hole
in two shots. Needing two putts to win, his first putt stopped 12
inches from the cup.</TE>
<TE>   "He's worked hard," Cook said. "He deserved to win."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who finished at 266, earned $720,000 and should move up
high enough in the world ranking to qualify for the Match Play
Championship at the end of February.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Don Blake posted the best score of the round, a five-under 65
that left him alone in third at 269.</TE>
<TE>   Toms caught Kelly at 13 under through five holes, but gave it back
with a double bogey and finished with a two-over 72.</TE>
<TE>   He tied for fourth at 270 with Matt Kuchar (72) and Charles Howell
III, who made only four pars in his round of 70.</TE>
<TE>   Cook got within one stroke with a birdie on the 12th and stayed
close to Kelly until a cell phone rang when he was at the top of his
back swing on the par-three 17th.</TE>
<TE>   "No! No cell phones," Cook screamed as the ball sailed right into
a deep bunker.</TE>
<TE>   He blasted out to six feet, but the par putt burned the right edge
of the cup for his only bogey on the back nine.</TE>
<TE>   He reached the back of the green on the par-five 18th in two and
gave his eagle putt a good roll, but it slid by on the right.</TE>
<TE>   He settled for a two-putt birdie and a 69.</TE>
<TE>   Tougher pin positions and the pressure of the final round kept
anyone from running away with the tournament early on.</TE>
<TE>   Even though conditions were balmy and breezy, same as they have
been all week, no one in the final four groups broke par on the front
nine.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly played tentatively, missing his first four birdie chances on
the low side of the hole.</TE>
<TE>   His first mistake was coming up short into a bunker on No. 5 to
make bogey, and he walked off the green with his two-stroke lead
having disappeared.</TE>

<KH>Diane Pucin  25 Days to Salt Lake City</KH>
<HD>Rough Run</HD>
<DH>Illness Robbed Debbie Heald of Chance at Olympic Glory</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debbie Heald will carry the Olympic torch Tuesday. Once, she expected
to carry an Olympic medal.</LD>
<LD>   Once, Debbie Heald set the world record. She was 16, a junior at
Neff High in La Mirada in her first international meet and she beat
the women from the Soviet Union, bigger, stronger, older, silent
women who scared her. Until she ran past them.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Heald runs past the neighborhood dogs who shatter the night
silence with their noisy greeting. She knows the police who patrol
the streets of Norwalk in the middle of the night. They will flash
their lights at Heald or pull over to say hello when Heald runs and
walks the streets from 2 a.m. until 3 or 4, depending on how her sore
hip feels. On weekends, Heald runs at 5:30. Her goal is to stay away
from trouble, to let the drunks from the bars get home.</LD>
<TE>   Her goal once was to conquer the world with her track shoes and
her talent. Now, the men on the backs of the garbage trucks wave.
Street cleaners call out her name. Heald will point to a house and
say that the men who live there will sometimes party late and throw
their empty beer bottles at her as she moves by.</TE>
<TE>   "People," Heald says. "I just don't understand them."</TE>
<TE>   Heald is 46. When Heald runs, she has a long, sure stride. Her
hips are balanced, her feet touch the ground lightly.</TE>
<TE>   In the quiet nights, as she runs or walks for hours and miles, 12
to 15 each evening, Heald is alone with her thoughts and sometimes
she can't help but think about how her life was supposed to be.</TE>
<TE>   Heald lives in a small apartment off Firestone Boulevard, a busy
street filled with car dealerships, fast food restaurants and,
sometimes, trouble. She has a roommate and a position that's
part-time job and part-time volunteer at the Norwalk-La Mirada adult
education department.</TE>
<TE>   Her co-workers love Heald, who has a degree in education from Cal
State Fullerton and once had plans to be a teacher and coach like her
mentor, her hero, her coach, her second father, Roy Mason. She was
going to become a teacher after she had run in the Olympics, maybe in
a couple of world championships, surely after she had won some gold
medals in her race, the race, the 1,500-meter run.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Heald will carry the Olympic torch when it arrives in Los
Angeles on its nationwide tour in advance of the 2002 Winter Olympics
at Salt Lake City. Heald will pick up the torch at the Coliseum at
3:15 p.m. She will wear a USA team-issued sweat suit. It came with a
T-shirt and baseball cap and, the day the gear arrived, Heald cried.
Nothing in her life will mean as much to Heald as the three-quarters
of a mile she will run with the torch.</TE>
<TE>   Her family and her friends are taking off work. Mason is driving
12 hours from Ukiah. This will be, truly, an Olympic moment in a way
to make us realize what the Olympics are supposed to mean.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Does the name Debbie Heald ring a bell? Does it tickle your
memory? You've heard that name before, haven't you?</TE>
<TE>   If you are a fan of track and field, you probably have.</TE>
<TE>   On March 17, 1972, Heald, 16, set the world indoor mile record at
the Richmond Coliseum in a dual meet against a powerful Soviet Union
team. This was in the middle of the Cold War. The Soviet women were
dominant. The U.S. team was made up mostly of teenagers. Heald's
victory was as stunning as was the fact the U.S. women won.</TE>
<TE>   In a photo in Sports Illustrated, Heald is crossing the finish
line with her hands raised, palms forward and a big smile filled with
joy and astonishment. Heald won the race in 4 minutes 38.5 seconds.
Some 30 years later, it still stands as the high school indoor
record.</TE>
<TE>   It was Heald's first international meet. Also in the race were
Doris Brown, Heald's 27-year-old hero and then the mile record
holder; five-time world cross-country champion Tamara Pangelova, who
had set the world indoor record the week before in the European
Championships, and Ludmila Braghina, who would win Olympic gold later
in the year. All were at least 10 years older than Heald.</TE>
<TE>   Heald ran in shoes held together by tape because she couldn't
afford new ones. She called home to Mason, her coach, crying every
day because she was homesick and because the U.S. national coaches
wanted her to train differently from what Mason had asked. Her
previous best time had been 4:47. Her hope had been to run 4:44 or
maybe 4:42. Her "outside dream," as she called it, was to hit 4:40.</TE>
<TE>   When Heald got home the next day, the world had noticed. Banners
were up in her neighborhood. Shoe companies began mailing gear.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran in a meet in Long Beach the next week," Heald says, "and I
thought I was the coolest thing. I was walking around in all my new
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   In those days there wasn't much in the way of college
scholarships, but a girl with Heald's talent was certainly noticed
and nurtured. Mason had become her teacher in fourth grade. Heald's
father had recently died and her mother, Ernestine, had asked that
Debbie be assigned to a male teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Mason, a runner, started a track team at the grade school. Debbie
wasn't fast but she was persistent. "All of a sudden," Mason says, "I
was noticing that Debbie's name was at the top of best times list for
all the longer races."</TE>
<TE>   Heald slowly became Mason's star runner and almost an adopted
daughter. She missed the 1976 Olympics when stress fractures kept her
out of the U.S. trials but there was no reason to think that, in
1980, Heald wouldn't be a prime 1,500 candidate.</TE>
<TE>   When Heald graduated from high school, she went to Fullerton on a
need-based scholarship and Mason, who had become coach at Bellflower
High, moved to Ukiah, wanting a less hectic life for his family. His
track club, the La Mirada Meteors, was disbanded but Debbie had begun
training at the Los Angeles Track Club under Coach Lazlo Tabori.</TE>
<TE>   For several years Mason and Heald lost touch. Mason would hear of
Heald, how she had moved to Berkeley to run for a Nike team and train
at California.</TE>
<TE>   "In June of 1980," Mason says, "I got a phone call from one of my
former runners telling me that Debbie had attempted suicide and was
confined to the psychiatric ward at Cedars-Sinai, diagnosed with
schizophrenia. I was stunned. As soon as I could, about a week later,
I drove to Los Angeles. What I saw, I couldn't believe."</TE>
<TE>   What he saw wasn't his strong, long-legged, bubbly young star.
What Mason saw was a woman with a vacant stare who was curled up in a
ball. What he didn't know, Mason would soon find out.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got to Berkeley," Heald says, "things started to happen
and I didn't even know it. I was acting weird but I didn't know that.
I guess I was hearing voices but I didn't know it. My roommates did.
I would disappear for a couple of days and I didn't know it and
didn't remember where I was."</TE>
<TE>   Heald tried to keep running, to run away from whatever it was that
was happening. But she couldn't and finally, in 1980 when she was 24
and should have been in her prime, a roommate called Heald's family.
Heald's mother and two brothers drove to Berkeley and took Heald to
Cedars-Sinai. She didn't leave the hospital for two years and then
only because her insurance, which had come through her association
with Nike, ran out.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 16 years, Heald's life was a series of
hospitalizations followed by release followed by a suicide attempt or
days of disappearance or wandering followed by readmittance to the
hospital. She held odd jobs--as a delivery person, as an office
worker, whatever she could find.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd find an apartment and start my life and then it would happen
again," Heald says. "I could always tell somewhere inside. I'd know
things were going bad again."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever she could, Heald would run. Between hospital stays, Heald
would try to join a track club.</TE>
<TE>   "I would run but I couldn't follow the sport," Heald says. "It
hurt too much. I'd see the people I used to run against and beat,
Ruth Wysocki and Francie Larrieu, and I couldn't stand it."</TE>
<TE>   All this time, Mason stayed in Heald's corner. He would visit a
couple of times a month. He would take her from the hospital for
lunch or a movie. He would help her find jobs or an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Heald was put on a medication that has kept her disease
at arm's length. Tom Flood, a counselor at the Norwalk-La Mirada
adult school, and a former runner and coach who knew Mason and Heald,
stepped in. He got Heald the job at the school. "I tell you," Flood
says, "Debbie runs this office."</TE>
<TE>   And since 1996, Heald has not been in the hospital. But the
medication caused Heald to gain weight. "I couldn't stand that," she
says. Thus started her middle-of-the-night runs. The medication makes
it impossible for her to drive, so Heald takes the bus to work.</TE>
<TE>   Every summer she visits Mason and his family in Ukiah for a week
or two. Her mother and stepfather live in Banning. Her brother Mike
lives in West Hollywood. Her brother Dana lives in Yorba Linda with
her niece and nephew.</TE>
<TE>   When Mason saw an ad in a magazine with an application to carry
the torch, he thought of Debbie. Debbie said Mason could fill out the
application. "But I never thought I'd be accepted," Heald says. "I
was at Roy's place this summer when I got the letter I was picked."</TE>
<TE>   Mason, 70, says he expects to cry Tuesday. Flood is taking the
afternoon off from work and driving to the Coliseum with four other
fans of Heald's.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to be sad about what happened to me and how I never got to
run in the Olympics," Heald says. "But I have gotten over that. I
have my life and on Tuesday I think I'll be the happiest person you
can imagine."</TE>
<TE>   There certainly will be many grand Olympic moments to come this
winter. No Olympic performance will be as meaningful as one
46-year-old woman running briefly but with hope, holding high a torch
and holding dear the memories of a world record.</TE>
<TE>   The record is only a memory. But the running, that she'll have
always.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Figure Skating Championships produced an Olympic team that
will send at least one woman to the medal podium--and possibly
more--1968 Olympic gold medalist Peggy Fleming said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We all think this is the best team we've ever sent," said
Fleming, a commentator for ABC. "We probably should be sending five
or six women to the Olympics, and they could come in the top eight or
seven or six. Technically and artistically, they were absolutely
wonderful, and that's great for our sport.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe we might sweep it. Who knows? It's not impossible."</LD>
<TE>   Michelle Kwan on Saturday won her sixth U.S. title. Sasha Cohen of
Laguna Niguel was second, with Sarah Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y.,
third.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming was more cautious in assessing the U.S. men's chances.
Without a consistent quadruple jump, six-time U.S. men's champion
Todd Eldredge will have a tough time against the athleticism and
artistry of Alexei Yagudin and Evgeny Plushenko of Russia; Tim
Goebel, the men's runner-up, can land quads but Fleming believes he's
not a complete skater.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's probably not much consolation after she missed the Olympic
team, but Angela Nikodinov of San Pedro was assigned to compete in
the Four Continents Championships starting Jan. 21 at Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov finished fourth at the U.S. championships, one place out
of an Olympic berth. She was named an alternate to the team.</TE>
<TE>   The teams for the Olympics and the world championships are the
same, but some Olympians skip the world competition. This year's
event will be held March 18-24 at Nagano, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Beatrisa Liang of Granada Hills, ninth at the U.S. championships,
will make her debut at the world junior championships March 4-10 at
Hamar, Norway. Tenth-place finisher Ye Bin Mok of Los Angeles was
named an alternate. Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler of Manhattan Beach,
and Sima and Amir Gabana of Torrance, also will compete at the world
junior meet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cohen is scheduled to carry the Olympic torch tonight in San
Diego. Goebel will take his turn Tuesday at 7:45 a.m. in Laguna
Niguel.</TE>

<HD>Organizers Plan for an Encore</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the last lutz was landed and the last sequin scraped off the
ice at Staples Center, organizers of the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships were ready to do it again--but on a bigger scale.</LD>
<LD>   Calling last week's event a "big-time" success financially,
competitively and logistically, Larry Kriwanek, chairman of the
LA2002 organizing committee, said Sunday the group plans to bid for
the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships. The bid process is
expected to begin next year.</LD>
<LD>   "This local organizing committee is in place and we're experienced
now," Kriwanek said, "and we're willing and eager to do it again. I
think the skating community understands that L.A. can support an
event like this, and I think they'll be willing to come back again in
a much shorter time frame than 30 years."</LD>
<TE>   Before this year, the Los Angeles area hadn't hosted the national
championships since 1972, when they were staged in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   John LeFevre, executive director of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.,
indicated his group would be amenable to returning before another 30
years pass.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely. It's a wonderful place to have an event," he said.
"Everybody's enjoyed it. The hotels were wonderful, everything was
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center spokesman Michael Roth said the arena would welcome
another major figure skating event.</TE>
<TE>   "We were thrilled with the way the building handled it, and with
the attention it brought L.A. and Staples Center," he said. "The U.S.
championships is really the type of event we feel Staples Center is
worthy of hosting."</TE>
<TE>   LA2002's partnership agreement with Staples Center was reached
before the arena opened in 1999. The organizing committee paid
Staples Center's out-of-pocket expenses for staging the event, and
Staples will receive a portion of the revenue linked to gate
receipts. LA2002 keeps the ticket revenue. LA2002 also paid the U.S.
Figure Skating Assn. a bid fee of $250,000, half up front and half
due after the event.</TE>
<TE>   Kriwanek said he had anticipated a profit of $1 million, which
will go to a foundation that will provide grants to Southern
California athletes who participate in ice sports. With a record
number of tickets distributed for all sessions--125,345 for the
competition, plus about 13,000 for Sunday's exhibition--he said the
profits could be even higher when the final tallies are completed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a success for Southern California skating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being a financial success, the championships were a
dramatic triumph.</TE>
<TE>   With Olympic berths at stake, the tension that usually accompanies
the national championship was magnified, and the prominent parts
played by local skaters gave the crowd strong emotional involvement.
Torrance native Michelle Kwan rebounded from an uneven season to win
her sixth national title, and Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel entranced
the crowd with her artistry and won an Olympic spot with a
second-place finish. Tim Goebel, who trains at El Segundo, lost his
U.S. men's title to Todd Eldredge, but as runner-up he gained his
first Olympic berth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun because of all the support," Cohen said. "Sometimes it
was overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   LeFevre said he was pleased with the crowds, even though some were
light for the weekday sessions at Staples and the Sports Arena. He
described those figures, some of which were announced at about 5,000,
as within normal range, especially for a major city when most
potential spectators are working.</TE>
<TE>   "Every nationals you look back and say, 'How did it go?' and I'm
very, very pleased with this nationals from every aspect," he said.
"The judging was good. There were no flukes and everything was pretty
straightforward. I think everybody agrees this is the right team, the
right winners."</TE>

<HD>Lavin's Plan Is a Winner</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As much as the legions of Steve Lavin bashers don't want to believe
it, UCLA upset No. 1 Kansas primarily because of a sound game plan.</LD>
<LD>   Jayhawk Coach Roy Williams may appear more distinguished,
intellectual and substantial, but he was outcoached by the
slick-haired 37-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA employed a zone press that disrupted the Kansas offense,
which is based on getting the ball to the frontcourt quickly, spacing
three guards above the free-throw line and either getting the ball
inside to a post player or kicking it out for an open perimeter
jumper.</LD>
<TE>   But the Bruins impeded the Jayhawks' ability to get the ball into
the frontcourt. Senior guard Kirk Hinrich and freshman guard Aaron
Miles struggled against the press, each contributing five turnovers
to Kansas' total of 21.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA made six steals--including two each by Dijon Thompson and
Jason Kapono--and forced numerous bad passes. Matt Barnes also played
a big role in the press.</TE>
<TE>   The senior forward scored 27 points, but his defense was just as
important. He double-teamed the guard bringing the ball upcourt,
slowing the Jayhawk attack and forcing them to fall back into a
motion offense.</TE>
<TE>   But because Dan Gadzuric and Andre Patterson were sealing off the
interior, Kansas had little choice but to launch three-point
attempts, often just beating the shot clock.</TE>
<TE>   Only Hinrich was successful--he made five of six from behind the
arc. His teammates were a combined six for 22.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Kansas was held to 77 points--nearly 16 below its
average.</TE>
<TE>   "We played with great energy on defense, it was maybe our best
defensive game yet," Gadzuric said. "It didn't seem like they could
get many good shots."</TE>
<TE>   Another Lavin move was to leave only one player to try for
offensive rebounds and get everyone else back on defense to thwart
the Jayhawks' fast break. Again, this resulted in Kansas having to
slow the tempo, make extra passes and settle for three-point
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   So while Kansas did get 14 offensive rebounds, UCLA won the
overall rebounding battle, 34-32. And, of course, the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barnes' shooting has improved in every area. In his first three
seasons he shot 46.8% from the field, 19.8% from three-point range
and 54% from the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   This season he is at 54.3% from the field, 50% from three-point
range and 66.1% on free throws.</TE>
<TE>   His scoring average has improved each year, from 3.9 to 5.6 to
11.6 to 14.0.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy attended the game and fulfilled a
lifelong dream by chatting with 91-year-old John Wooden beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to meet the Wizard," Tracy said. "Growing up in Ohio, I
followed so many of those championship teams. Spending a few minutes
with him was an incredible thrill."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy invited Wooden to visit him at Dodger Stadium during
baseball season.</TE>

<HD>At Face Value, Granville Excels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brandon Granville's face is just about at elbow level when he
ventures into the lane.</LD>
<LD>   And the 5-foot-9 senior point guard has been taking a lot of blows
to the face of late, including the two he absorbed against No. 11
UCLA on Thursday, the second of which sent him to the bench for more
than eight minutes when he experienced blurred vision.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what's up with that," Granville said with a smile,
trying to explain the frequency with which he has been hit this
season. "I guess they're after me.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just a freak thing though."</TE>
<TE>   Granville is sporting a shiner under his right eye after his
latest encounter, which occurred with less than 10 minutes to play in
the Trojans' 81-77 victory over the Bruins. But it came not from an
opponent but from Sam Clancy, USC's 6-7, 240-pound power forward.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to take a charge on Billy Knight," Granville said. "Sam
went up for the block and I was on the floor and Sam came down and
hit me with his knee in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm straight now."</TE>
<TE>   During preseason workouts, Granville took an elbow to the mouth
from his then-roommate and backup point guard Robert Hutchinson that
loosened Granville's front teeth. He has been wearing a special
mouthpiece on the court since and is USC's second-leading scorer,
averaging 12.8 points overall, 16.2 in conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With two blocked shots against UCLA, Clancy pulled into a
three-way tie for ninth place with Arizona's Ed Stokes and Stanford's
Tim Young on the Pacific 10 career list with 167.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy is USC's all-time leading shot blocker.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 13-2 Trojans are 5-0 in Pac-10 play for the second time in
school history. The 1999-2000 team won its first five conference
games.</TE>
<TE>   The 1960-61 Trojans also won their first five league games, but
that was when they played in the Athletic Assn. of Western
Universities.</TE>
<TE>   USC won the league title that season by going 9-3 and finished
21-8 after advancing to the second round of the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   With a victory at No. 20 Arizona on Thursday, the Trojans can
become the first USC team to begin league play 6-0 since 1942-43,
when USC played in the Southern Division of the Pacific Coast
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   USC's 1932-33 team started a school-best 9-0 in PCC play.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' nine-game winning streak, which began Dec. 12 at Long
Beach State, is their longest since the 1991-92 season, when USC, led
by Harold Miner, won nine in a row en route to a 24-6 finish and No.
8 final ranking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC had not been ranked in the coaches' poll since the week of
Nov. 12, when the Trojans were No. 23. They are No. 23 in this week's
poll.</TE>
<TE>   The Associated Press poll, which last ranked the Trojans at No. 24
the week of Nov. 19, will be released today.</TE>

<LD>It's isn't only the men's teams that take the USC-UCLA basketball
rivalry seriously.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojan women's team defeated the Bruins, 67-57, on Sunday, and
the final score doesn't begin to tell what happened before 5,331 at
Pauley Pavilion. The game had all the bone-jarring basketball and
cross-town rancor a fan could ask for.</LD>
<LD>   Bodies hit the hardwood again and again. Coaches on both sides
howled over any perceived missed call.</LD>
<TE>   With 5:32 to play in the second half and the Trojans ahead, 58-43,
USC's Ebony Hoffman and UCLA's Shalada Allen got into a scuffle after
both went after a loose ball under the Bruin basket. Both received
flagrant double technical fouls and were ejected. It was a play that
had UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier and USC Coach Chris Gobrecht yelling at
the referees and at each other.</TE>
<TE>   Gobrecht received her own technical with 4:56 to play when she
charged the officials after they initially charged Aisha Hollans with
a foul (it was corrected and assessed to Jessica Cheeks). With 1:12
left, Gobrecht got a second technical and was sent to the locker
room. But not before responding to some heckling UCLA fans by
pointing at the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   In the end USC, which led by 20 points at halftime and didn't let
the Bruins get closer than nine points in the second half, improved
to 9-7 and 5-2 in the Pacific 10. UCLA dropped to 5-10, 2-5.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward Gobrecht, who beat UCLA at Pauley for the first time in
five tries as USC coach and earned her 200th Pac-10 victory, was
still upset over what she felt was borderline dirty play by the
Bruins in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the team that was winning and winning big. Why in the
world would we be starting anything?" Gobrecht said.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have called a foul on them every time they came down
the floor--every single time. And [the officials] did nothing to
clean that up. Those [UCLA] kids were out of control; they held,
grabbed, pushed, shoved or smacked us every single time.</TE>
<TE>   "And we weren't doing anything. We weren't even playing our normal
defense. We, at that point, were just trying to get out of there
alive."</TE>
<TE>   Olivier, unsurprisingly, had a different view.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, any time you play your cross-town rival it's going to
be ugly, so to speak," Olivier said. "And it either brings out the
worst in people or the best in people. I'm proud of our team and I'm
proud of how they handled themselves. We never stopped fighting--no,
we never stopped working hard."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Hoffman-Allen scuffle, Olivier said: "I couldn't
hear everything because I had someone else in my ear. But from what I
heard, they got tangled up and I guess they each threw a little punch
in there. From my angle I couldn't really see it; I just know how
[Allen] is. I don't think she would do that. I felt the refs were
trying to get control back into the game. It kind of went drastic, so
to speak."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman--who ended up at the bottom of a pile of players that
resulted from the altercation--said she merely pushed Allen off of
her, adding, "I was getting some cheap shots."</TE>
<TE>   Allen said she did not punch Hoffman and that the incident "was
blown out of proportion."</TE>
<TE>   Each player must wait to learn if she can play in her team's next
game Thursday. According to NCAA rules, if the officials report the
incident as a fight, there is an automatic suspension for the next
scheduled game. Also, a conference office or other assigning
authority cannot change an official's ruling that a fight took place,
or lessen the severity of the penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Gobrecht said she would fight any suspension of Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   "She pushed the kid off her, because the kid was punching her, for
goodness sakes," Gobrecht said. "For her to be kicked out like that,
that was wrong. And that's just typical Bruin cheap stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Some basketball was mixed in with the conflicts. The smaller
Bruins tried to pressure the Trojans over every inch of the court. It
worked early, as UCLA goaded USC into several turnovers, and the
Bruins were within 16-15 after two Whitney Jones free throws with
9:28 left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But then USC's offense suddenly got locked in, and UCLA's offense
got locked out.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans outscored the Bruins, 27-8, over the rest of the half.
Hoffman and Carmen Krause (who scored a team-high 14 points) worked
inside for layups, and Lauren Smith-Hams, Erin Young and Krause made
three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA made only two baskets in that span, both by Allen, and
totaled eight field goals (in 33 attempts) in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin guard Natalie Nakase led all scorers with 21 points.</TE>

<LD>   Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt finished eighth to win the combined
event, which adds the times from the weekend's downhill and slalom.</LD>
<LD>   The leader after the opening slalom run, Kostelic held on during
his second run to finish with a two-run time of 1 minute 42.29
seconds, edging Slovenia's Mitja Kunc by .01.</LD>
<TE>   Kunc, second in the opening leg, appeared to be the winner after a
strong second run, as Kostelic committed a string of mistakes, losing
much of his advantage from the first leg. But he heaved himself
across the line for the narrow win. He also won the season-opening
slalom in Soelden, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing the first run in 19th place, Miller produced the
second-fastest final run to move up to sixth, at 1:43.11.</TE>

<TE>   Laure Pequegnot of France skied a near-perfect second leg to win a
women's World Cup slalom at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria, and move
into first place in the seasom slalom standings. She finished in a
combined time of 1:27.22 seconds to beat Sonja Nef of Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Nef clocked 1:28.80 for the two legs. Third place went to Ylva
Nowen of Sweden, .67 seconds off the pace. Americans Kristina Koznick
and Sarah Schleper came in fourth and fifth, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's Renate Goetschl won the combined, which matched times
from Saturday's downhill with those of the Sunday's slalom.</TE>

<TE>   Todd Hays rallied the United States to a victory in the four-man
bobsled at St. Moritz, Switzerland, his final World Cup race of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Sharing second were the Swiss team led by Christian Reich and the
German team led by Andre Lange.</TE>
<TE>   Hays, a strong medal favorite for next month's Olympics in Salt
Lake City, decided to end his World Cup season and return to the
United States to prepare for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   With two victories and a second-place finish, Hays leads the
four-man World Cup standings with 171 points. Lange is second at 163,
followed by Switzerland's Martin Annen at 151.</TE>
<TE>   Hays was 0.01 seconds behind Lange after the opening run but came
back with a blistering second effort.</TE>
<TE>   He and teammates Randy Jones, Paul Jovanvic and Garrett Hines had
a two-run time of 2 minutes 5.61 seconds.</TE>

<TE>   Austria overcame two more spectacular leaps by German star Sven
Hannawald to win a team event in World Cup ski jumping at Willingen,
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Austria ended a six-year title drought in the team competition,
earning 1,141.3 points from its four jumpers. Finland was second at
1,141.3 while Germany was third at 1,112.0.</TE>

<HD>For Parry, It's Quite a Present</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARAPARAUMU BEACH, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>Craig Parry couldn't believe his luck at the New Zealand Open, and
Tiger Woods had trouble believing the greens.</LD>
<LD>   Playing on his 36th birthday, Parry went to the 18th hole on
Sunday one shot behind Michael Campbell. When he walked off the final
green, Parry had a two-shot lead after a birdie and Campbell's
double-bogey at 17.</LD>
<LD>   "I've had many opportunities and many chances, but things haven't
gone my way," Parry said of the lead swing that eventually became a
one-shot victory when Campbell birdied 18. "Sometimes in the game of
golf you just have to grin and bear it."</LD>
<TE>   While Parry was grinning, Woods was thwarted by greens that
wouldn't give him a break--including a four-putt second hole for
double-bogey.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit the ball well all week but I didn't get anything out of the
greens," said Woods, who had a 69 on Sunday to finish in a tie for
sixth, six strokes behind Parry.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what it would take to get him back to New Zealand next
year, Woods said, "Guarantee that I'd make a few putts."</TE>
<TE>   Using a new set of clubs, Parry finished with a 68 for a
four-round total of 11-under-par 273 on the par-71 Paraparaumu Beach
links layout that Woods' New Zealand caddie, Steve Williams, played
regularly as a junior.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, who just missed an eagle putt on No. 18 that would have
forced a playoff with Parry, finished in a three-way tie for second
at 10-under 274 after a 69. Also tied for second were Steve Alker
(70) of New Zealand and Stephen Leaney (71) of Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell had birdied Nos. 15 and 16 to put him in the lead.</TE>

<HD>Choking on Pretzel, Bush Faints Briefly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush briefly lost consciousness Sunday after he choked on
a pretzel while watching a football game on television in his living
quarters, the White House said.</LD>
<LD>   After fainting, the president tumbled to the floor from a couch,
bruising his lower lip and suffering an abrasion the size of a half
dollar on his left cheek, White House physician Dr. Richard Tubb said.</LD>
<LD>   Tubb, an Air Force colonel, said Bush recovered quickly.</LD>
<TE>   "I do not find any reason that this would happen again," Tubb told
news agencies in an interview arranged by the White House. "He fainted
due to a temporary decrease in heart rate brought on by swallowing a
pretzel."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, 55, was found to be in good health during a full physical exam
in August.</TE>
<TE>   Aides say he conscientiously adheres to an exercise regimen, running
on a treadmill in the White House residence, and while at his Texas ranch
or Camp David, routinely racing through three-mile jogs in 21 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The result of his aerobic workout routine has been a resting pulse
rate of 35 to 45 beats per minute, which medical personnel consider
extremely low even for a well-trained athlete. A typical resting pulse
rate is about 70 beats per minute.</TE>
<TE>   Tubb said Bush's slower heart rate made him more prone to fainting
when a nerve was stimulated by the pretzel caught in his throat. The
medical term for such an episode is vasovagal syncope, or vasovagal
fainting, Tubb said. In such cases, the body sends a signal to the heart
via the vagus nerve. This causes a sudden drop in heart rate, which is
restored when the person falls.</TE>
<TE>   Such fainting is a common and harmless event that does not signify any
underlying illness or have any lasting effects, said Dr. Marshall Morgan,
head of the emergency department at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "If food goes down the wrong pipe, the natural response is to cough,"
he said. "It is pretty common for people who are coughing to have a
syncope," a brief fainting spell.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear Sunday night whether the episode was accompanied
by any seizure-like activity that could be a symptom of a more serious
matter. Both cardiac rhythm aberrations and seizures are among the
transient medical problems that can cause someone to lose consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's incident occurred while Bush was alone, watching the National
Football League playoff game between the Miami Dolphins and the Baltimore
Ravens, the White House said. His wife, Laura, was using the telephone in
a nearby room at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it [the pretzel] didn't seem to go down right," Tubb said.
"The next thing he knew, he was on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Bush believes he blacked out for only a few seconds because, as he
revived, his two dogs were sitting in the same positions they had been in
when he lost consciousness, the doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the dogs were looking at him funny," White House Press Secretary
Ari Fleischer told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   According to the White House, Bush fainted about 5:35 p.m. EST. About
five minutes later, he contacted a nurse on duty at the White House; Tubb
was summoned eight minutes later and hurried to the White House to
examine the president.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said Bush used an elevator to go from his residence on
the second floor of the White House to the ground-floor doctor's office.
The medical examination that was conducted there included the use of a
heart monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Tubb said Bush's blood pressure and pulse were normal and that he was
not taking any medication as a result of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor said the president had complained Saturday and Sunday that
he was "a little off his game" and thought he was coming down with a head
cold.</TE>
<TE>   "He had not been feeling well the last couple of days," Tubb said,
adding that Bush had exercised rigorously Saturday but had a lighter
workout Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The White House disclosed the incident about 2 1/2 hours after it
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The episode is the second medical incident involving the president in
about a month. In early December, the White House acknowledged that Bush
had several benign skin lesions removed from his face. The announcement
came several days after the procedure, in response to questions from
reporters who noticed red marks on the president's face.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bush is scheduled to leave the White House for a two-day trip
to the Midwest and New Orleans to promote trade and its role in
stimulating the economy. Tubb said he would examine the president this
morning before he left on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Bush did not plan to alter his schedule: "At this
point, he intends to travel."</TE>

<DL>PARK CITY, Utah
</DL>
<LD>"In the Bedroom," a wrenching family drama, has emerged in recent
weeks from the clutter of year-end movies to become a strong contender in
Hollywood's annual race for the Academy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   Its distributor, Miramax Films, has trumpeted the film in television,
radio and newspaper advertisements as one of the year's must-see movie
experiences, listing all the awards and nominations it has already
received, including a Golden Globe nomination for best motion picture
drama. But "In the Bedroom" did not begin as a studio release. It was
picked up at last year's Sundance Film Festival, the annual celebration
of American independent movies founded two decades ago by actor Robert
Redford's Sundance Institute and held each winter in this picturesque
mountain resort.</LD>
<LD>   As the 20th annual edition of Sundance hits full swing here this week,
the search for Oscar-worthy films has become part of the landscape,
reflecting a "home run" mentality, as one filmmaker puts it--whether it's
in pursuit of award-type films or big box-office payoffs--that has swept
over this festival in recent years. Some say it is at odds with the
original intent of Sundance.</LD>
<TE>   This year, about 200 features and documentaries will play at
Sundance--along with dozens of other films at the festival's unrelated
satellites such as Slamdance and Slumdance--with as many as 20,000
filmmakers, fans and journalists expected to attend. Major festivals such
as Cannes, Toronto and Berlin have become crucial to the marketing of
movies, but it's Sundance that has the most direct ties to Hollywood
because of its links to studios and American filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The festival's growing importance to Hollywood also reflects the sea
change in the film industry over the last quarter-century, as movies open
on thousands of screens, living or dying on their first weekend in
release, and blockbusters are made by dumbing down scripts so they will
appeal to teenagers who flood the megaplexes each weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Hollywood studios regularly turned out epic productions
like "Ben-Hur" and "Lawrence of Arabia" that could be counted on to
become best picture candidates at the Academy Awards. Today, the studios
seem more consumed with creating and marketing blockbusters, whether it's
the computer-enhanced wizardry of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
and the upcoming "Spider-Man"; green-lighting risk-averse sequels like
"Rush Hour 2" and "The Mummy Returns"; or relying on star-driven fare
like "Ocean's Eleven."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the studios have come to rely on their art-house
divisions to comb the festivals looking for thought-provoking,
character-driven movies that can give a studio the prestige that comes
with an award-winning film.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Sundance has proved to be fertile territory. Fine Line
Features, the art-house side of New Line Cinema, discovered a small
Australian film called "Shine" at Sundance and then rode the 1996 release
to seven Academy Award nominations, including best picture. The
critically acclaimed 1999 film "Boys Don't Cry" was acquired by Fox
Searchlight after executives viewed only sample footage of the
uncompleted film at Sundance. The movie's lead, Hilary Swank, went on to
win the Academy Award for best actress.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Paramount Classics, the artsy label of Paramount
Pictures, paid less than $2 million for a Sundance picture called "You
Can Count on Me," which told the story of a wayward brother who comes
back to live with his more strait-laced sister in a small town.
Capitalizing on strong reviews, the film went on to take in nearly $10
million while receiving Oscar nominations last year for its female lead,
Laura Linney, and director Kenneth Lonergan's original screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Sundance gave birth to four films that are now in the hunt
for Oscar nominations. One is "In the Bedroom"; the second, "Memento," is
a mystery-told-backward tale released by Newmarket Film Group. The other
two movies were acquired at Sundance by Fox Searchlight, the tonier label
of 20th Century Fox: "The Deep End," about a woman who spirals out of
control while trying to keep her son from being found culpable in a
murder investigation; and "Waking Life," a quirky animated film about a
man in a dream state who encounters characters talking about their views
on human existence.</TE>
<TE>   The reason Sundance is so important for an Oscar-worthy movie,
filmmakers say, is because it provides a great launching pad, with
hundreds of journalists and critics in attendance who can give a film the
kind of buzz money can't buy.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't really have a better start," said "Deep End" director David
Siegel. "It has an incredible amount of power that can influence
someone's career--or life, for that matter. It's kind of terrifying. If
you are looking to get something out there, there is no greater stage."</TE>
<TE>   To purists, or at least those who remember what Sundance was like in
earlier days, the emphasis on Oscar shopping, deal-making and big-name
celebrities places enormous pressure on young filmmakers to make movies
that are commercially viable. Among the many stars at this year's
festival are Robin Williams, who has a thriller called "One Hour Photo,"
and Jennifer Aniston of "Friends" fame, who stars in a movie called "The
Good Girl."</TE>
<TE>   Director Penelope Spheeris, who has worked in both the studio and
independent worlds with such films as "Wayne's World" and last year's
documentary "We Sold Our Souls for Rock 'n' Roll," is not one to begrudge
Sundance a few mega-deals or even a few celebrities on the red carpet.
But she is dismayed at how the festival has changed during the years she
has been coming here.</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened," Spheeris says, "is the studios, mainstream
filmmaking and star-laden pictures have inundated Sundance and changed it
from its original intention. . . . Let the up-and-coming filmmakers have
their chance at film festivals."</TE>
<TE>   But Geoffrey Gilmore, the festival's longtime program director,
stresses that Sundance still shows movies that cost under $10,000 to
produce and also some that cost more than $10 million, but he insists the
festival remains a "discovery" festival at heart, where new talents get
their works shown.</TE>
<TE>Money Also Motivates Distributors at Festival</TE>
<TE>   It isn't only Oscars that distributors are after. It's also money.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, a film will debut at Sundance that will far exceed
everyone's box-office expectations. That certainly happened with the
documentary-style fright film "The Blair Witch Project," which was picked
up at Sundance by Artisan Entertainment and went on to gross $140.5
million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a risk," said Patrick Gunn, Artisan's executive vice
president for overseas acquisitions. "The other side of that coin is it's
frequently the unexpected films that end up doing very well. The biggest
film to come out of last year's [Sundance] was 'Memento' [which took in
$25.5 million], and it wasn't expected to be a big box-office hit."</TE>
<TE>Studios Come 'Looking for a Home Run'</TE>
<TE>   Director Bart Freundlich, whose film "World Traveler" is at this
year's festival, believes the studios are increasingly coming to Sundance
"looking for a home run." Freundlich said he first noticed the trend in
1997, when Hollywood was buzzing over how a small British comedy about
male strippers called "The Full Monty" took in $250 million in worldwide
box office.</TE>
<TE>   "When 'The Full Monty' came along," he said, "people realized that you
could make $250 million off a movie that cost $3 million. Film
distributors and financiers slowly realized that they could pick
something up for a little money and there was a huge potential upside.
They segued from being in the business of making films about interesting
things and ideas which might be hard to get through a studio system into
kind of home-run seekers."</TE>
<TE>   Sundance founder Redford said Sunday that he doesn't blame Hollywood
for its fixation on making blockbusters, rather than taking risks on
smaller films.</TE>
<TE>   "You can look at it real cynically and say, since Hollywood is a
business, it's a great deal for them," he said. "They don't have to fund
these scripts, they just dare exhibit them when they're safe, when they
prove themselves at Sundance. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "Look at 'You Can Count on Me.' It wasn't even noticed. 'Blair Witch'
was totally ignored. Suddenly, it shatters the industry. It
revolutionizes a whole new way of thinking about digital films and things
of that sort."</TE>
<TE>   However, Redford does believe the studios are missing the point.</TE>
<TE>   "Any business that has such grip on the entertainment industry, that
shrinks itself out of greed, is losing out."</TE>
<TE>   The film that really started it all, Sundance veterans say, was Steven
Soderbergh's 1989 film, "sex, lies, and videotape," which was made for
about $1 million and went on to gross $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the one that sort of changed the world," said Tom Bernard,
co-president of Sony Classics, which last year had a huge Oscar contender
and surprise blockbuster in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." The Ang
Lee-directed martial arts movie picked up a huge critical buzz at various
film festivals.</TE>
<TE>   "They won the lottery with that movie," Bernard said of "sex, lies,
and videotape." "Everyone else has been trying to win the lottery ever
since. Everyone read the headlines and said, 'Go to Sundance and you're
rich!' It used to be you had to have a lot of passion to get your vision
on the screen. Now, rather than who will be the next big director
discovered, it's who has the most money."</TE>
<TE>   The success of these films sparked a bidding frenzy at Sundance in the
mid-1990s, which saw Castle Rock Entertainment shell out a reported $10
million to acquire distribution rights to a 1996 film called "The
Spitfire Grill," which went on to gross only about $13 million. In
ensuing years, huge sums were spent on little films like "Next Stop
Wonderland" and "Happy, Texas" that failed to ignite the box office.</TE>
<TE>   "I think after a few years where prices were clearly too high, things
are back at a reasonable realm," said Mark Gill, who heads Miramax's Los
Angeles office. "You see movies bought for $1 million, $2 million or $4
million, but not $10 million. There could be a bidding war this year, but
I don't think it will escalate to those levels of the past."</TE>
<TE>   Now the bidding frenzy has subsided--more often than not, studios have
scouted out Sundance films and picked up the ones they want for
distribution beforehand--but not the desire by studios to make the big
score.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Baxter, who heads the smaller Slamdance Film Festival that got
its start in Park City eight years ago among filmmakers who couldn't get
into Sundance, believes Sundance has changed significantly from its early
years.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days of independent filmmaking, people used to come here
during the summer with their 16-millimeter films; obviously they fell
way, way out of the studio system, and they would make a tour of the
resorts, including Park City. A bus used to roll up in Park City and they
would show 16-millimeter movies inside the bus. This is the seed, this is
how Park City got started showing films.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, [Sundance] is more of a market," Baxter said. "Of course, the
festival still shows great films by new filmmakers, but from the overall
perspective, this [market aspect] seems more important.'</TE>
<TE>   This emphasis on swinging for the fences--part of the winner-take-all
mentality familiar in other aspects of American life, from sports to
business--can have a detrimental effect on young filmmakers with movies
in competition. Sundance veterans say that if a movie is not picked up,
the filmmakers often leave the festival fighting the impression that they
somehow failed in their task.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, some young directors trekking here this year with
their first feature-length films feel uneasy talking about the money that
can be made at Sundance.</TE>
<TE>   "Money is good, and I'm not going to turn down money," said Austin
Chick, a 28-year-old filmmaker from New York, "but if it was about money,
I'd be working on Wall Street by now."</TE>
<TE>   Chick's film, "XX/XY" (the title refers to human chromosomes), tells
the story of a menage a trois among college friends and what happens a
decade later when they meet again. The film has received some buzz among
would-be distributors, but he adds that making big, impersonal Hollywood
movies at this point doesn't really interest him.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make movies that make sense to me," he said. "It's not
about size or scope or budget. I would sooner make a smaller-budget
movie, make my movie, than a big Hollywood movie where I wouldn't have a
role, where I'd just be a cog."</TE>

<HD>Deciding if a Child Is Safe</HD>
<DH>When a woman is being abused, should her child be removed from the
home? Agencies are trying strategies to deal with the question.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent night in Palmdale, a woman makes a desperate 911 phone
call. Her husband is beating her, she screams.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies respond and find the woman with
a red welt budding around her right eye. Her husband sits glumly on a
nearby chair.</LD>
<LD>   In a bedroom of the apartment, deputies from a special domestic
violence team question an 8-year-old boy who has witnessed the assault.</LD>
<TE>   "He was slapping her," Brian says of his stepfather and mother. The
boy is standing teary-eyed and shaking near his parents' king-size bed;
he says he is too scared to stay at his home anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mark Richardson and domestic violence counselor Christine
Vargas have a decision to make: Is the household violence so great that
they should start the process of removing Brian from his mother's care?</TE>
<TE>   Questions of that sort are creating dilemmas in California and across
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Many states have recently stiffened penalties for abusers who commit
domestic violence in the presence of children. But the movement has
resulted in some children being taken from nonabusive mothers accused of
failing to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   The cases raise serious questions: How can juvenile authorities
protect the children of battered women without revictimizing the mother?
Will women be less likely to report abuse if they fear their children
will be taken from them? Or will the fear of losing them help some women
decide to leave abusive situations?</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of more aggressive responses from child welfare authorities
point to horror stories of youngsters emotionally scarred by witnessing
repeated violence at home or being assaulted themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But critics contend that the child welfare system is too quick to
remove children from their abused mothers, even if such separations are
temporary.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes much more sense to get the adult victim and child victim
into a safe place than to take the child away from the one person who can
protect them and that they love," said Gail Pincus, who operates a Los
Angeles program for abuse victims and batterers.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, a group of battered mothers won a preliminary
injunction last month against the city's Administration for Children's
Services, which had removed their children.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein ruled that the practice was
penalizing the abused mothers and their children. A spokeswoman for the
agency said that it plans to appeal, but also that it is undertaking its
own reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The lead plaintiff, Sharwline Nicholson, 33, a Brooklyn mother of two,
was beaten by her boyfriend one winter morning two years ago. Their
year-old daughter lay in a crib in the bedroom during the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Nicholson dialed 911 and left her daughter in the care of a
neighbor. Nicholson, who suffered deep head gashes and a broken arm, was
taken to a hospital where, she said, a cousin reassured her that the
children would be tended to.</TE>
<TE>   After she woke up the next day, she said, child welfare authorities
informed her that she would have to appear in court a week later if she
wanted to see her children.</TE>
<TE>   "I was out of my mind at the time," Nicholson said. "I couldn't
understand how things had gone from A to Z automatically. They wouldn't
release my children to me because they hadn't arrested my boyfriend."</TE>
<TE>   Her children were put in a foster home, where, Nicholson alleges, they
were left uncleaned and with scratches over their bodies. They were
removed and placed with another foster family, but during their three
weeks in custody her son never attended school, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The children's services agency declined to comment on specific
allegations. However, officials said authorities try to keep children
with their mothers unless their safety is threatened. And, among other
changes being pursued, the agency is improving training for its
caseworkers.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, child welfare agencies estimate that each year 2 million
to 4 million women are victims of domestic violence that is witnessed by
3 million to 10 million children. The agencies' studies have found that
as many as 60% of children in homes where their mothers are abused also
are beaten. There are no solid statistics on how many children are
removed from homes where spousal abuse occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Among the states addressing the issue are Nevada, which empowers
judges to order psychological treatment for children of abuse victims,
and Alaska, where children exposed to domestic violence can be placed
under the jurisdiction of juvenile court.</TE>
<TE>   But some good intentions have backfired. When Minnesota passed a law
last year requiring that police provide child welfare authorities with
domestic violence reports, the system was overwhelmed with new cases and
the law was repealed.</TE>
<TE>   In California, batterers can receive harsher penalties if violence is
committed in front of children. Gov. Gray Davis vetoed legislation in
November that would have required each county to develop guidelines for
child welfare intervention in domestic violence cases. Davis said
programs to accomplish those goals already exist.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents called his veto a missed opportunity to help front-line
people such as Deputy Richardson and counselor Vargas, who intercede with
families while making their way through an emotionally explosive and
legally murky landscape.</TE>
<TE>   As part of Los Angeles County's Safety Through Our Perseverance, or
STOP, program, they interview family members, document injuries, obtain
protective emergency orders and arrange for shelter, counseling and other
services.</TE>
<TE>   They also talk to children at the scenes of domestic violence to
determine if they've been harmed or threatened. They can take a child
into custody if there appears to be immediate danger, and they can
initiate an investigation by child protective services.</TE>
<TE>   While at Brian's home, Vargas questioned him, asking him what he
wanted to happen and examining his body for any signs of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   One factor in such cases is the mother's willingness to cooperate,
Richardson said. In this incident, Brian's mother took the first steps
that night toward getting a restraining order to keep his stepfather
away. The boy remained at home without any intervention from authorities.</TE>
<TE>   On another outing, Richardson--a 20-year Sheriff's Department
veteran--and Vargas--a victim's advocate with the Antelope Valley
Domestic Violence Council--end up at another woman's Palmdale apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The night before, her jealous husband had punched, kicked and choked
her. In the last year, the beatings had become almost a daily occurrence,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her 4-year-old son witnessed the latest violence and went to stay with
his grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me, 'I don't want to live with you and Dad,' " she says,
cuddling her 3-year-old daughter. "He cries and says, 'I don't like to
see you like that.' "</TE>
<TE>   Richardson asks if her husband should be sent to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though he does what he does, I care about him," she responds.
"He has a really good job, and I care enough to support him because he
wants to take care of our kids."</TE>
<TE>   She says he has never been violent with the children.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I grab the kids and hold them and say, 'No, don't do
anything,' so he won't hurt me," she says. "I want to separate from him,
but in a good way. I want him to be a part of my kids' life. The only
problem we have is him beating me up."</TE>
<TE>   After they leave, Richardson and Vargas talk about how the woman
doesn't seem to realize that she has been using her children literally as
a shield.</TE>
<TE>   "She's minimizing the fact that it's as serious as it is and that her
children are getting involved in it," Richardson says.</TE>
<TE>   When he asks Vargas about whether to report the case to the county
Department of Children and Family Services, she doesn't hesitate. They
both agree that child protective services should be notified.</TE>
<TE>   A caseworker ultimately interviews the woman and talks to her about
the danger of using her children to fend off her husband. After making
sure that the children are clean, that there is food in the house and
that the husband is not on the scene, the case is closed.</TE>
<TE>   But any recurrence of violence in the children's presence would
probably prompt a stronger response, either their removal or an
insistence that the woman move out with the children, Vargas says.</TE>
<TE>   The woman's conflicted reaction is not unusual, experts say. Some
battered women are so financially dependent or emotionally manipulated
that they mentally minimize the danger to themselves and their children.
Though men are also victims of domestic violence, they make up the vast
number of perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   Other victims are intimidated by the legal system, lack supportive
families or have language barriers that make it hard to get help and
leave abusers, said Connie McFall, director of San Pedro's Rainbow
Shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Anita Bock, director of the county children's department, acknowledged
that, on occasion, children might be unfairly removed from homes, but she
said caseworkers face a balancing act. The county, she said, plans to
dramatically increase training for social workers in dealing with
domestic violence and the ramifications of removing a child from the
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people realize how many children don't come into the
system every day," Bock said. "We get 12,000 [domestic abuse] reports a
month in L.A. County, and a fraction of those result in removal of
children."</TE>
<TE>   But she also noted that "if something goes wrong, society and the
media are the first to say, 'Why did you leave the child there?' "</TE>
<TE>   Deanne Tilton-Durfee, executive director of Los Angeles' Inter-Agency
Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, successfully lobbied last month for
more than $53 million in Proposition 10 tobacco tax money for a five-year
program to help child abuse victims and their families, including cases
related to domestic violence. Part of the money will go to the sheriff's
STOP program.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to see women revictimized; no one wants to see children
ripped out of their homes," Tilton-Durfee said. "But we know children are
dying in those homes, and they are being emotionally harmed."</TE>

<HD>Bogota Fears Rebel Warfare</HD>
<DH>Colombia: Guerrillas say they'll evacuate zone created for talks,
signifying apparent end to peace process. There are worries insurgents
may attack big cities.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS POZOS, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Leftist rebels from Colombia's largest guerrilla army prepared
Sunday to evacuate a demilitarized zone created for peace talks, bringing
this nation a step closer to a full-scale war.</LD>
<LD>   The rebels announced that they would leave the zone as planned before
a 9:30 p.m. deadline today. More than 5,000 Colombian troops had
surrounded the Switzerland-size zone to seize control of the region,
which the government ceded to the guerrillas three years ago to
jump-start the peace process.</LD>
<LD>   With the process apparently over, the nation was transfixed by the
growing prospect that it was about to plunge into a terrible new chapter
of its 38-year-old internal conflict, which already claims more than
3,500 lives a year.</LD>
<TE>   Neither President Andres Pastrana nor rebels from the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia budged from their positions. The guerrillas,
known by their Spanish initials as the FARC, blamed the talks' failure on
Pastrana.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimatum of 48 hours . . . handed down by the president changes
everything we have agreed upon during the past three years and thus
closes all possibilities for the current process," said Simon Trinidad, a
former banker turned FARC negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   In a chilling note, Trinidad warned about the violence to come.</TE>
<TE>   "To the country and the world, we repeat our willingness to continue
using all forms of struggle for the changes that Colombia needs to
achieve reconciliation and reconstruction," he said. "The search for a
political solution is the patrimony of Colombia and the best road for the
future."</TE>
<TE>   FARC rebels already kidnap people to raise ransom money, attack rural
towns and military bases, and protect cocaine fields targeted by U.S.
drug planes. Many Colombians fear that with the end of the peace process,
the rebel army might begin striking major cities and bombing the
country's vulnerable infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Sunday that there seemed to be no reason for hope. "The
possibilities have run out," said Alfredo Rangel, a defense expert.</TE>
<TE>   Still, negotiators raced desperately against tonight's deadline,
hoping for a final concession that would resuscitate the moribund peace
process. Diplomats from 10 countries met with Pastrana on Sunday in the
capital, Bogota, in search of a solution.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. special envoy James LeMoyne, meanwhile, met with guerrilla
leaders in this peace village even though a previous 48-hour mandate
given to him by Pastrana to talk with the guerrillas had expired.</TE>
<TE>   LeMoyne described the situation as "very grave" but said he had not
given up hope. On Sunday afternoon, he disappeared into the jungle with
one rebel negotiator, leading to speculation that he might be meeting
with the guerrillas' supreme commander, Manuel Marulanda.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels also reportedly had contacted Cuban President Fidel Castro
in an attempt to involve him at the eleventh hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to suggest that there is a magic solution. It's possible
that we won't get what we're hoping for, which is peace for this
country," LeMoyne said. Then, his voice catching, he asked all those who
wanted peace to "pray a little," before turning away to go back to the
negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   Nestor Leon Ramirez, mayor of San Vicente del Caguan, the largest town
in the rebel zone, said he had spoken with Pastrana twice and with the
government's top negotiator, Camilo Gomez, once. Gomez, he said, was on
the way to the zone from Bogota.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana "asked me to tell the people to stay calm," Leon said. "He is
still analyzing some details" of the final FARC proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis began after Pastrana, declaring that the FARC had exploited
the haven to abduct people and raise illicit funds, imposed security
restrictions that included aircraft surveillance and more military
patrols.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC has insisted since October that those restrictions be lifted,
and Pastrana has adamantly refused. In their last proposal, the
guerrillas seemed to take a step toward reconciliation, not mentioning
the restrictions in a 14-point draft accord.</TE>
<TE>   But Pastrana, speaking to a nationwide audience just before midnight
Saturday, announced that the government would not accept the draft, which
he said lacked concrete new proposals.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, residents of the zone watched with growing dread. Most
feared the entry of the military and violent paramilitaries, who
routinely massacre civilians they believe are linked to guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Pozos, people spoke of their fear of the future. But few had
the resources to flee the village, and many said they were simply too
tied down with children, homes and work to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very scary," Diego Alfonso Camallo, 16, said as he sat with two
friends on a park bench in the main square. "If the army enters, they're
going to say we're the ones that helped the guerrillas. They're not going
to care who is who."</TE>
<TE>   Others sounded more positive. Maria Olos brought her daughter on a
moped to buy a Popsicle from a giant plastic penguin that a vendor had
set up on the main square.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a frightening time, but I have faith," said Olos, 40, the mother
of four. "All of our lives are here. All of our work. All of our family.
I can only hope the peace process continues."</TE>

<HD>Officials Seek Enron Insider to Aid Probe</HD>
<DH>Energy: U.S. is looking for someone who knows a lot and has a great
deal to lose, FBI source says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department's investigation of Enron Corp.'s collapse
could take years and involve a review of millions of paper and electronic
records, so the agency has begun looking for a shortcut: an insider who
would tell all in exchange for leniency from potential criminal or civil
prosecution, authorities confirmed Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It is a path well trod by federal authorities in other complex
white-collar investigations of corporations: Gain the full cooperation of
someone high up enough in the hierarchy to have extensive knowledge of
its operations--and potential culpability in questionable acts--but not
so high that there aren't others in even loftier positions to merit
offering a deal.</LD>
<LD>   Current and former Justice Department and FBI officials confirmed that
such a process is underway but did not discuss details, saying it is
perhaps the most sensitive part of the investigation as it gets up to
speed.</LD>
<TE>   "It's obvious: You look for the weak points, someone you have leverage
on, who is in a position where they know a lot and has a great deal to
lose," said one FBI official, who spoke Sunday on the condition of
anonymity. "That will be one of the first points of the investigation.
You gain enough information against that person to say, 'This is the only
course of action for you that makes sense.' "</TE>
<TE>   And, said two high-ranking senators investigating the burgeoning
scandal, it appears as if some executives both at Enron and at its
auditor, the accounting firm Andersen, may have engaged in potentially
criminal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, on the face of it, some of the activities carried out by the
[Enron] corporate executives were not legal, and in violation of rules
and regulations--if not laws," Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Sunday on
CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), on the same show, also had harsh
words for Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that they were trading fast and loose with offshore corporate
entities that were hiding their debt from the public," said Lieberman,
chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is conducting one
of several congressional investigations into the company's failure. "We
know that they were saying things to the public, to shareholders, the
retirees . . . about how the stock was going to go up and--at the same
time they were selling their stock right then."</TE>
<TE>   The swiftness of Enron's collapse hinged in large part on the
company's disclosure in the fall of more than $600 million in losses, the
restatement of three years of financial results as well as the existence
of scores of complex, off-balance-sheet partnerships. Authorities say
they need one, or several, expert guides to help them navigate such
byzantine practices.</TE>
<TE>   Both senators said they will reserve judgment on whether such acts
were illegal until the various investigations--including those by the
congressional committees, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Labor and Justice departments--are complete.</TE>
<TE>   But they also suggested that executives at Andersen, known until last
year as Arthur Andersen, may have violated the law if an Oct. 12 internal
memo directed workers to destroy all audit material on Enron--except for
"work papers"--when it became clear that Enron was in deep financial
trouble. The two senators were asked about the memo, first reported in
Time magazine, by "Face the Nation" moderator Bob Schieffer.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of memo, to destroy documents, raises very serious
questions about whether obstruction of justice occurred here," Lieberman
said. " . . . If this memo is what it looks like, I'm afraid that the
folks at Arthur Andersen could be on the other end of an indictment
before this is over."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Andersen acknowledged destroying a "significant" number
of documents related to the Enron audit. On Sunday, the company said: "We
acknowledge that there were internal communications that raise questions.
Until we know more, it would be inappropriate to comment further. We will
take actions at the appropriate time."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the senators' comments, authorities said it was far too early
to speculate on whether actions by Enron executives and the company's
auditors went beyond poor judgment and into the realm of criminal
wrongdoing. But they confirmed that they will focus on the destruction of
corporate documents, conflicting statements about Enron's financial
health, the creation of scores of corporate partnerships and other
matters that could amount to criminal violations of fraud and securities
laws.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said last week that its top criminal prosecutor
in Washington will oversee an Enron task force employing lawyers and
agents from at least four cities--an indication that it expects the
investigation to be complex.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI is being joined by other agencies, possibly including the
Internal Revenue Service, to determine whether laws were broken as the
Houston-based company tumbled from its perch as the world's largest
energy trader, its market value falling from $60 billion to that of a
penny stock in a matter of months. Enron's sudden fall culminated Dec. 2
in the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history and the loss of
thousands of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   A senior FBI official in Washington said agents have spent weeks in
Houston, Washington, New York and San Francisco identifying
documents--and people--likely to figure in the investigation. Already,
federal prosecutors in Houston have sent out grand jury subpoenas to
potential witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Just look at the sheer size of the corporation," one senior FBI
official in Washington said. "This is not a small bank we're talking
about here."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Justice Department official with the Clinton administration,
who helped oversee similar corporate investigations, said a knowledgeable
cooperative witness could make or break such a complicated financial
case.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be a nightmare of an investigation. The key will be if the
FBI can flip someone on the inside, someone who says, 'I want to be
around to watch my children grow up and go to college,' " the former
official said. "They will cut a deal with somebody. . . . I am sure they
are reaching out to people; it could short-cut what could take them a
matter of years to a few months.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially when you get to a jury," the former official said, "you
need someone on the witness stand saying, 'This is what we did.' "</TE>
<TE>   In such cases of alleged corporate wrongdoing, the difference between
filing criminal or civil charges often centers on the issues of knowledge
and intent, current and former Justice officials said.</TE>
<TE>   If Enron executives did indeed sell their stock before it was about to
decline significantly in value, how much of the details did they know of
the company's impending collapse?</TE>
<TE>   And did they then take any actions to deceive stockholders, employees,
Wall Street and the public into believing that the company was in better
financial condition than it was?</TE>
<TE>   If so, the former senior Justice Department official said, "I think
there is huge criminal exposure" for Enron and its auditors.</TE>
<TE>   Many FBI agents assigned to the task force are forensic
accountants--specially trained financial experts who will pore over
documents to establish a trail of decisions by top executives. These
could point to illegal acts or indicate that the executives engaged in
unethical behavior or used judgment that, though poor, did not rise to
the level of criminality.</TE>
<TE>   But, the former Justice official and others said, authorities also
will be using old-fashioned investigative techniques to home in on those
company employees who could testify about the knowledge and intent of
corporate executives, or who could point investigators to potentially
incriminating documents, meetings and discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the universe of who the people are who could have known
[about wrongdoing]," the former Justice official said. "You do research,
talk to friends, people on the outside. You ask around and then approach
people."</TE>
<TE>   Chances are that some executives already may be considering
cooperating in the civil and criminal probes of Enron, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the people with potential liability have lawyers and have
already gone to them and said, 'I have a problem,' " the former official
said. "Some of those lawyers will say, 'Look, do you want me to go to the
FBI and see if we can start discussions?' A good lawyer who handles
white-collar defense would be almost committing malpractice by not at
least exploring this."</TE>
<TE>   Once an executive showed a willingness to cooperate, negotiations
would ensue between FBI agents and federal prosecutors, on one side, and
the prospective witness and his or her lawyers, on the other, over what
the person knows and would be willing to say under oath.</TE>
<TE>   Decisions on who would be allowed to "make a deal"--traditionally
without any specific promise of leniency--probably would be made at the
highest levels of the Justice Department. A formal offer would then be
made.</TE>
<TE>   The individual accepting that offer, the former Justice official said,
"could get probation or even immunity--no prosecution at all--while
others could face significant prison time" if criminal charges are filed.</TE>
<TE>   Such agreements can be controversial, especially in such a
high-profile case, authorities said. Not only did thousands of people
lose their life savings in Enron's collapse, but the company's extensive
lobbying efforts--and the campaign contributions by its employees,
directors and political action committee--give the case a political
aspect as well.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll need to balance someone who knows a lot with someone who
would have a relatively minor-enough role to give them immunity. There
will only be a small number of people they will let in," said the former
Justice official.</TE>

<HD>Child Support Case Lifts Covers on Lifestyle of Rich</HD>
<DH>Courts: Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's ex-wife says their daughter,
3, needs $320,000 a month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The court file chronicling Kirk and Lisa Bonder Kerkorian's
decade-long courtship, monthlong marriage and newly escalating child
support dispute leaves no doubt that the rich are indeed different from
the rest of us.</LD>
<LD>   In what is being touted as a test case for California's wealthiest
parents, the billionaire MGM studio and casino mogul and his former
tennis pro wife are fighting in Los Angeles Superior Court over just how
much money it takes to properly raise their 3-year-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Is it $35,000 a month, as he suggested in the prenuptial agreement;
$50,000 a month, as they agreed to in the divorce settlement; or $75,000,
as he paid from August 2000 to September 2001? How about $320,000, the
amount of money she says was lavished each month on little Kira's
lifestyle while her parents got along?</LD>
<TE>   When times were good, court papers say, money was no object. In March
1999, 20 children and 30 adults attended Kira's first birthday party,
held at the posh Hotel Bel-Air at a cost of $70,000. Despite her tender
years, Kira has flown more than 35 times from Los Angeles to New York,
France and beyond--always on private jets.</TE>
<TE>   At her 84-year-old father's insistence, Kira had three nannies fussing
over her as she was shuttled among the $13-million, 23-acre gated estate
overlooking Benedict Canyon, the $5-million Las Vegas house, her father's
new $10-million house a few blocks from the Beverly Hills Hotel and her
mother's renovated $8-million home nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian, 36, last week took the bold step of making public what
previously had been a very private matter. She filed a 33-page court
declaration that lays bare details of the personal life of a billionaire
known for guarding his privacy.</TE>
<TE>   For a time it seemed that Kerkorian would keep a lid on publicity
about the marriage and divorce by filing for an expedited dissolution
with no hearings. His lawyers argued in court papers that Kerkorian is "a
very famous man," and that "the matter of his divorce has been kept
entirely confidential to the extent possible."</TE>
<TE>   No more.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian's declaration reads like a novel. And that, said Kirk
Kerkorian's lawyer, Dennis M. Wasser, in an interview, "is because to a
large extent it is fiction."</TE>
<TE>   As she tells the story in court papers, she met Kerkorian in 1986, and
they became tennis partners and friends. In 1991, as her first marriage
crumbled, they became romantically involved. Kerkorian urged her to "walk
away" from the marriage without demanding alimony and child support for
her son so that he wouldn't be dragged into a public divorce battle, she
says.</TE>
<TE>   She became Kerkorian's "constant companion" and hostess at social
events with dignitaries such as Lee Iaccoca and Alexander Haig. When
Kerkorian opened the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas in 1993, she was at his
side, entertaining guests at the VIP party. They traveled, spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars on vacations in Hawaii and Europe. They
went out to dinner almost every night. He was a heavy tipper, and "Kirk's
name and a $100 bill were enough to get him the finest table at any of
the top restaurants in town," she says in court papers.</TE>
<TE>   "Money was never a limitation, or even a consideration, when Kirk
wanted to either construct, acquire, own, charter, hire or pay for such
desires as homes, airplanes, yachts, hotels, cars, staff or
entertainment. Essentially, whatever Kirk wanted, Kirk got," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She pressed him to marry her, and when he wouldn't she tried to leave
him during the summer of 1997. But when she learned in August of that
year that she was pregnant, Kerkorian welcomed their child, she says.
Still, he wanted nothing to do with marriage. That's when lawyers became
involved.</TE>
<TE>   She was eager to give their relationship "dignity and respect" and to
"legitimize" their child. Kira was born March 9, 1998, but the Kerkorians
wouldn't marry until the following August--and then only if she'd agree
to file for divorce a month later. The 28-day union and swift,
uncontested divorce left her "heartbroken," she says.</TE>
<TE>   There was another condition: She waived all her rights to spousal
support. She says she agreed to that provision because "I believed and
hoped that Kirk's and my marriage would last. Actually, I was afraid to
object because I felt that if I did, Kirk would not marry me." Besides,
she says, he'd promised to always take care of Kira's every need. "In all
our discussions" about Kira, "the word 'needs' never meant basic needs,
but what was required to maintain her in the station of life and with all
the things and benefits befitting the daughter of Kirk Kerkorian."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Kerkorian paid for Kira's vacation and travel expenses, and for a
time supplied $20,000 to $30,000 in cash each month in addition to the
agreed-upon child support, the court papers say. But, his former wife
charges that he drew the purse strings tighter as their relationship
chilled. She accuses him of using his wealth to try to control her. When
she balked at his demand that she and Kira continue to live in Beverly
Hills, she says he withdrew the perks, at one point telling her, "My
airplane is no longer part of your lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian is now asking the court to award Kira $320,000 a
month--$3.8 million a year. As a compromise, she suggests Kerkorian pay
$220,000 a month and allow his daughter to fly five times a year on his
private $56-million Boeing 737, which is equipped with a living room,
kitchen, two bedrooms and seats for 21 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been advised that there has never been a child support order
in the amount I am seeking in California," Lisa Kerkorian acknowledges in
her declaration. She went on to speculate that most fathers of comparable
wealth, even after a break-up with the mother, opt to maintain a child's
lavish lifestyle rather than engage in a public court fight.</TE>
<TE>   With people of average income, calculating support is fairly simple.
Income figures and expenses are applied against a standard computerized
formula, which determines how much support should be paid. But applying
the program to the extremely wealthy is not practical or possible. In
this case, all a judge can do is look at the past.</TE>
<TE>   For Kira--and her mother--the private jets, chartered yachts, summers
in France, nannies, gardeners, housekeepers, security guards and almost
unlimited supply of cash are things of the past. Lisa Kerkorian says
she's selling her own securities to maintain Kira's lifestyle. It can't
be done on $50,000 a month, she says. She's "house rich and cash poor."</TE>
<TE>   So far, only her side of the story has surfaced in the public record,
but his lawyer promises a strong response. Wasser said she "deliberately"
breached previous confidentiality agreements by filing her papers in the
public divorce file, rather than in the sealed paternity case file. By
making the dispute public, Wasser said, she disregarded her daughter's
best interest.</TE>
<TE>   Her version, Wasser charged, "is built on a bed of lies. Now that she
has unfortunately chosen to make it a public issue, it will be necessary
for Mr. Kerkorian to fully respond to all those allegations, to refute
them and to ensure that the court has compelling evidence of the truth."</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, Kirk Kerkorian is maintaining his silence.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian's lawyer, Stephen A. Kolodny, said his client is being
truthful and shakes his head at the prospect of a nasty court battle.
"It's all over money," he said. "All over money when it's got to be a
meaningless commodity because he has so much of it. The last thing Lisa
wanted to do was get involved in litigation with Kerkorian. He's a tough
guy."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, the couple kept things civil. After signing both the
marriage and divorce papers, they went out to dinner as usual, leaving
Kira at home with her nannies. They continued to travel and live together
at his estate, even after the divorce. She and Kira resided in the main
house, while Kerkorian occupied the guest house.</TE>
<TE>   Their falling out, according to the court file, came during the summer
of 2000 when she confronted him about rumors that he'd been seeing other
women. While she vacationed at a $100,000-a-month Malibu beach house, he
traveled in Europe and sailed aboard a chartered 209-foot yacht. Finally,
that August, she vowed to leave Kerkorian after running into him at a Los
Angeles restaurant while he was on a date with another woman.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he continued to pay for renovations to a home for Kira and her
mother in Beverly Hills. He supplied an additional $3 million to complete
the project. But in August, after she announced she was moving with Kira
to New York, he demanded repayment. Then, within days, he placed a lien
on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian maintains that the home improvement money was a gift
and is asking the court to declare it as such. Kirk Kerkorian insists
that it was a loan.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing is scheduled March 11--just two days after Kira's fourth
birthday. Family law attorneys say Kerkorian vs. Kerkorian could be the
California test case that determines how lavish a lifestyle the children
of the very wealthy can expect if their parents divorce.</TE>
<TE>   California law does not set a cap on child support payments, and the
state's guidelines give judges wide discretion in cases involving the
wealthy. In Los Angeles, for example, anyone who makes more than $750,000
a year is considered a high earner in some courtrooms. In others, the
figure is $1 million, said Beverly Hills attorney Daniel Jay Jaffe, who
is not involved in the Kerkorian dispute.</TE>
<TE>   But just how much does a billionaire's child really need?</TE>
<TE>   Among the monthly expenses Lisa Kerkorian lists: $144,000 for travel;
$14,000 for parties and play dates; $7,000 for charity; $4,300 for food,
plus $5,900 to eat out; $2,500 for movies, theaters and outings; $1,400
for laundry and cleaning; $1,000 for toys, videos and books; and $436 for
care of Kira's bunny and other pets.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers say it is common practice for spouses seeking child support to
submit high-end figures as a negotiating tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Jaffe said at the very least, a child of the very wealthy
should expect a nice home and the best schools and medical care. Use of
the private jet? Probably not.</TE>
<TE>   If Lisa Kerkorian prevails, $320,000 a month would be by far the most
expensive child support award in California. Even if she doesn't win
everything she seeks, the amount of support he was paying voluntarily, as
revealed in the court papers, already exceed the state's largest
awards--or at least those that have become known publicly through
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Those cases involved entertainment and sports figures, who were
ordered to pay monthly support of $20,000 or slightly more. Even last
year's notoriously contentious child support battle in New York between
Revlon magnate Ronald Perelman and his former wife, Democratic
fund-raiser Patricia Duff, resulted in a comparatively paltry monthly
award of $12,825.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Justice Franklin Weissberg sniffed at the notion that
little Caleigh, then 5, might grow up feeling deprived if she didn't
receive $100,000 of her father's money each month.</TE>
<TE>   And, the judge noted, child support should not become "disguised
alimony."</TE>
<TE>   At least as far as Forbes magazine is concerned, Perelman and the
other fathers weren't in Kerkorian's financial league. None of them
appear on the magazine's annual list of the world's richest people.
Kerkorian has been a fixture on the list since at least 1972. This year,
he ranks 46th, with an estimated $6.4-billion fortune. He is the majority
shareholder of MGM Mirage Inc. and one of the largest individual
shareholders of DaimlerChrysler. He's known as the king of the Las Vegas
Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian also is a woman of rank. In 1987, she ranked seventh on
the pro circuit, according to the Women's Tennis Assn. When she quit the
pro tour in 1988, according to her divorce papers, she earned $4,000 a
month.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The men of Ladder No. 5 need a good fire.</LD>
<LD>   They need to climb aboard the truck again in their heavy jackets and
boots and roar through lower Manhattan to a burning building.</LD>
<LD>   No one wants the destruction; they just need a reminder of who they
are and what they do. But there hasn't been a big fire since Sept. 11,
and now the men spend their days trying to rebuild a company badly broken
when it lost a third of its members in one brutal day.</LD>
<TE>   It is not the grief so much that gets in the way, or the faces of 16
fatherless children at the Christmas party that haunts them. It is that
No. 5 cannot recapture its routine, the day-to-dayness that seemed to
vanish under the falling World Trade Center towers.</TE>
<TE>   The men did recover most of their dead brethren's bodies. They were
stacked in a stairwell of Tower 1. And because their brand-new truck was
crushed under the rubble, the old rig was brought out of retirement from
the training academy and back to the firehouse. That put No. 5 back in
business within days of the Sept. 11 attacks--and gave great comfort.</TE>
<TE>   But rebuilding the company, housed in a brick building on 6th Avenue
at West Houston Street, has been near impossible.</TE>
<TE>   From the big things--like recruiting eight replacements--to the little
ones--like figuring out where to get metal chocks--life at the firehouse
is a struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought a small metal doohickey used during fires to
keep doors open would be another reminder of what was lost?</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Santore, one of the most devoted and now deified of the dead
firefighters, used to weld the metal chocks by hand in the back of the
station. He'd paint them Day-Glo green, hand one to each guy, and throw
the rest in a giant Maxwell House coffee can. Now the big firefighter
with the mustache is gone and a few weeks ago on Monday, the can was
empty.</TE>
<TE>   More difficult was finding enough guys who could steer the back of the
truck. Only 20 of the thousands of firetrucks in New York City require a
tiller man; No. 5 has one because the firehouse covers an area of narrow
streets and alleyways in Chinatown, Little Italy, Greenwich Village and
SoHo. But not enough of the surviving firefighters know how to fill the
job.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to have someone from another company come in to be
your tiller man or chauffeur for any shifts," says John Maurer, who was
being trained last summer to handle the job but had never done it on a
run. Burly and young, the firefighter squints and tenses up his shoulders
describing his first time at the tiller after Sept. 11: " 'OK, I'm doing
it,' I thought. 'Barely.' "</TE>
<TE>   Several guys had to take a crash course on spinning the tiller to the
right when the 65-foot truck was turning left, and turning left when the
chauffeur, driving up front, veered the truck right.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no accidents but quite a few near misses," says Lt. Tim
O'Neill, one of the officers charged with putting the company back
together.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill has been with the department 20 years and knows the
intricacies of its bureaucracy and of the profession. He understands the
importance of ventilation during a fire--when to saw, tear or puncture a
roof--and he knows how to crawl through an apartment hallway looking for
survivors amid black smoke and flames.</TE>
<TE>   But the last few months have tested his understanding of his role in
the firehouse in ways he never could have imagined.</TE>
<TE>   He and the other officers are scheduling recruits on shifts even
though they are unsure of their skills. They are now talking regularly to
reporters, politicians and celebrities. They are handling delicate
matters for the dead men's families; they also are handling unbelievable
amounts of cash because of all the donations pouring into the firehouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing things I was never trained to do," says the no-nonsense
O'Neill, 43. He has remained steady, but the pressure never stops, even
when he gets home.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the men, he now has a family newly concerned about his
job. His 15-year-old son, Tom, who never had much of an interest in what
he does, now asks his father routinely where he is going, when he is
coming home and what he is doing.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still the same everyday garbage to do around here and at
home, but too often someone says something here or there and it's
'click'--and you think about [Sept. 11] and the guys who are gone,"
O'Neill says.</TE>
<TE>Uneasy in the Spotlight</TE>
<TE>   In the last four months little has been normal, and the men seem tense
because of it, even when the so-called fun stuff happens. The relentless
firehouse joking--"busting chops"--has slowed, and the men are
surprisingly sensitive about the new national fascination with New York's
firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes up that Ivana Trump va va va voomed one of the most
down-to-earth guys in the company at a fund-raiser and playfully offered
her phone number, it is made clear that the name of the married subject
of her attention should not appear in the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stupid stuff," says one of the guys. "Where were all these
people, all this attention, three years or even six months ago?"</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, every 24-hour shift has been frantic, with Sept. 11 business
competing with ordinary business.</TE>
<TE>   One minute Jennifer Aniston and Britney Spears are sauntering into the
place to pay condolences; then three University of Texas students walk
off the street and beg to buy lunch for the whole firehouse.</TE>
<TE>   An older couple appear with a $350 check raised in pennies by
first-graders in a small Arkansas town. The couple, visiting New York for
an anniversary, don't even know what firehouse they are in. They simply
went to the one closest to their hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The guy at the front office graciously accepts their check, is
photographed with the couple and is hugged.</TE>
<TE>   A short while later a neighbor drops off a brand-new Sony sound system
"for one of the kids of the dead guys." She cries as she signs a 508-page
ledger of names of donors and lingers to talk. The firefighter, who has
work to do, patiently listens and also accepts a hug.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, one of the widows had stopped by to pick something up
and asked to see the bed upstairs where her husband used to sleep. The
guys showed her around. They also did a building inspection that day and
answered a call about a restaurant kitchen fire. In between, it was chow
time and they chopped up a salad and meat for tacos.</TE>
<TE>   This is the new "routine"--an ordinary post-Sept. 11 Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>'Killed With Kindness'</TE>
<TE>   By no means are the men ungrateful for all the outside attention.
They're simply overwhelmed. They crave the old mind-numbing days of the
firehouse--24 hours on duty, 72 hours off, cat up a tree, fights over the
TV remote control, and the luxury of washing the truck and thinking about
nothing else.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, we're being killed with kindness," says Jeff Anstead, a
12-year veteran who, like Santore, represents the soul of No. 5. He has
replaced Santore as a chauffeur during his shifts.</TE>
<TE>   "I take my chauffeur position very seriously as a way to remember
John," Anstead says. "I expect a lot of people around here and especially
of myself."</TE>
<TE>   Anstead is a fit 39-year-old with blue-gray eyes and a slightly
grown-out buzz cut. He is talkative, a little jumpy and often angry these
days. Things bother him. Like why aren't they having the typical,
elaborate funerals at St. Patrick's Cathedral for each of the 343
firefighters who died Sept. 11? He knows the answer: There are just too
many dead. But he still is angry.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, all the attention from the outside world gets to be too
much and the men pull down the heavy metal doors of the firehouse and
lock them. They also lock the side door and go to the very back of the
house or upstairs to sit around together. Sometimes they drill or take
apart a complicated emergency scenario to keep their skills fresh. But
more often they just sit around and try to talk about something else,
anything other than Sept. 11: sports, gossip, more sports, their
kids--anything.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the closest-knit job you can ever have with people who
literally go to battle together," Anstead says. "Sept. 11 pulled apart
our routine, but it can't pull us apart."</TE>
<TE>   He interrupts himself to bark an order over the microphone: "Remember,
I don't want to see white wine vinegar on the slaw. Only balsamic!" He is
half busting the chops of the guys in the kitchen, half serious.</TE>
<TE>   Anstead, like others, is concerned that new men who fill vacant jobs
at No. 5 understand its history and traditions--that they should take
chauffeuring seriously and never use anything but balsamic on the slaw.</TE>
<TE>Other Firefighters Fill In</TE>
<TE>   In late September, the city set up a rotation for experienced
firefighters to fill in for 90-day tours at companies that lost
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 firefighters from all over the city volunteered. No. 5,
which shares space with Engine No. 24 and the 2nd Battalion command,
attracted many volunteers. Some came because they were friends with the
lost firefighters. Others were attracted to the firehouse because it is a
"premier door."</TE>
<TE>   Why? No. 5 is in a lively, safe Manhattan neighborhood, the kind of
place where on a hot night the men can leave the door open without
worrying about drive-by shooters. They also fight fires as varied as the
housing stock--from high-rises to tenements, from lofts to waterfront
piers.</TE>
<TE>   Getting permanently assigned there, however, takes some doing--sort of
like getting into a prime college fraternity but with a milder hazing
process.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to like the guys and know they don't have an attitude," says
Anstead, who was relieved when one particularly cocky recruit moved on in
December.</TE>
<TE>   John Maurer only joined No. 5 in June and remembers last spring how
Mike Warchola, who died Sept. 11, let him know he would make it in.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike was about to retire, and I didn't know if he cared," Maurer
recalls. "But one day he just took me aside and said, 'John, I heard you
put your papers in. I'll do what I can.' That was it. No big deal."</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it goes. But it is a big deal nowadays. No. 5 still is
testing recruits, watching them work and mix it up with the others. A few
have been tapped, but who will stay still is not clear.</TE>
<TE>   The rhythms will return to No. 5 the more calls they take, the more
they get to fight a raging enemy to help people.</TE>
<TE>   "When something is frightening you, you want to get back in," O'Neill
says. "It's like a football player who blows out his knee. He wants to
play again.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to play again."</TE>
<TE>   They need a good fire.</TE>

<HD>Air Marshals' Future Full of Questions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The date was Sept. 11. Vowing to combat "the menace of air piracy,"
the president announced that specially trained, armed federal agents
would be deployed on airliners.</LD>
<LD>   That president was Richard Nixon, and the year was 1970, when a series
of violent hijackings around the world shook the confidence of air
travelers.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-one years later, President Bush also has turned to air marshals
to protect the skies. By the time of the World Trade Center and Pentagon
attacks, the nation's corps of marshals had shrunk from a high of about
2,000 to a mere 32. And on Sept. 11, 2001, they were in the wrong
places--assigned to selected high-risk international flights, not
domestic flights like the transcontinental routes targeted by Al Qaeda.</LD>
<TE>   Even though the program is now being rapidly expanded to perhaps 2,000
or more marshals--the number is classified--odds remain low that any
given flight will have plainclothes marshals aboard.</TE>
<TE>   It would take 120,000 marshals or more--men and women who usually work
in teams--to cover the 30,000-plus daily flights in the United States,
security experts and former government officials said. Such a program
could easily cost more than $10 billion a year. Budget figures for the
current program are classified.</TE>
<TE>   "What the government is doing is promoting a program to make people
feel good," said Douglas Laird, a former security director for Northwest
Airlines, who thinks Bush should find a better way to spend taxpayers'
money. "Security is best ensured before the plane departs. I'd rather
have marshals help on the ground than have them on the plane to shoot it
out with someone--at that point, it's too late."</TE>
<TE>   Others are concerned that the marshals will again face budget cutbacks
as soon as the perception of a threat recedes. Indeed, there was an
attempt to shut the program down as recently as the early 1990s. And some
worry that the current fast-paced expansion could compromise high
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the program say air marshals can be an effective part of
a many-layered security strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "I always maintained, and still do, that it has a deterrent effect,"
said O.K. Steele, a retired Marine Corps general who headed the Federal
Aviation Administration's security branch in the early 1990s. "Terrorists
would never know whether they would have to confront marshals. To be able
to overcome them, they would have to put more people on a flight. And
when they put more people on, they're exposing themselves to detection by
other means."</TE>
<TE>   The FAA, which runs the marshals program, has little to say about it,
citing a security need to keep its operations secret.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of applicants are vying for air marshal jobs that will pay
$35,100 to $88,800 a year, depending on qualifications and experience.
(Hundreds of agents temporarily on loan from other federal agencies--such
as customs, the Border Patrol and the Drug Enforcement
Administration--are filling in for now.)</TE>
<TE>   In the newly expanded program, marshals are covering domestic as well
as overseas routes. Flights to certain airports--such as Washington's
Reagan National--are more likely to have them aboard, as are some
transcontinental flights.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting women is a priority.</TE>
<TE>   Prospective marshals must have superlative shooting skills, be no
older than 40 and pass several training courses and a background
investigation for top-secret security clearance.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans of the program say it also helps to possess an unnatural
ability for staying awake--and alert.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to remain focused on those long flights," said
Don Tyson, a former Navy SEAL who flew as a marshal from 1985 to 1992 and
is now retired in the Southwest. "When you're talking New York to Tokyo,
sometimes you're up 20 hours with no sleep. . . . You read a lot of
books."</TE>
<TE>   The image of an air marshal as a lone, dark-suited agent hunkered down
somewhere near the cockpit door could not be further from reality, Tyson
said. For one thing, a single marshal would be little more than a sitting
duck with a badge. One terrorist could flush him out and another could
take him down.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, you've got to have more than two people," Tyson said. "You
blend in with the passengers. You are dispersed throughout the aircraft."
Big, compartmented planes such as Boeing 747s would require a squad of
marshals.</TE>
<TE>   On a mission, the marshals arrive well before takeoff to meet with
airline security and the flight crew. The plane's captain--not the
marshals' team leader--remains the commander of the flight.</TE>
<TE>   Once airborne, marshals can communicate by various means, including
asking flight attendants to pass a note tucked in a prearranged page of a
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Being a dead-sure shot is the single most important qualification for
an air marshal, Tyson said. "We had the highest shooting standard of any
federal agency, bar none," he said. A combination of speed and accuracy
is prized.</TE>
<TE>   A plane's aluminum skin is fragile, and a high-altitude shootout could
lead to sudden, catastrophic decompression of the cabin. Air marshals use
special ammunition that is less likely to pierce metal. Because many
passengers could be hurt by volleys of gunfire in a cramped cabin,
marshals also train continually to make the first shot count.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the high standards, Steele and others familiar with the
history of the program say they are not aware of any instance in which
federal air marshals foiled a hijacking.</TE>
<TE>   In more than six years of service, Tyson said, he came close to
drawing his gun just once. It was on a U.S. airliner about to leave Cairo
for Paris in the late 1980s. Airline security alerted Tyson, who was the
team leader, that a suspicious passenger, termed a "high selectee," would
be boarding.</TE>
<TE>   The young Arab man had purchased a one-way ticket with cash, and his
face was still reddish from having recently shaved his beard. He was
assigned a seat near one of Tyson's fellow marshals. The passenger
appeared nervous. While the plane was still on the ground, he suddenly
got up and headed for the lavatory with a bag.</TE>
<TE>   With the marshals shadowing him, the passenger was challenged by a
flight attendant. He said he had diabetes and needed to inject himself
with insulin. The attendant asked him to do it in the galley, where crew
members could observe. Tyson moved in, ready to draw his 9-millimeter
commando-style pistol. A female marshal covered him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be able to face him head-on when he opened the bag,"
Tyson said of the man. "If he would have pulled out anything resembling a
weapon, I would have double-tapped [shot] him in the head."</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't come to that. The man raised a chorus of loud
complaints, and airline security hustled him off the flight before it
took off. Tyson continued on to Paris and later learned the man was not
considered a terrorist suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Such armed encounters are unsettling to many aviation professionals
because of the potential for lethal misunderstandings. "Most countries do
not allow any weapons on aircraft," said Laird, the former airline
security director. "The use of sky marshals has many critics in the
worldwide aviation community."</TE>
<TE>   Relatively few countries employ marshals, among them Israel, Jordan,
Iran and Egypt. All of these countries have a much smaller airline
industry, which means they require far fewer marshals. The history of the
U.S. program shows mixed results and an on-again, off-again commitment by
the government.</TE>
<TE>   Even before President Nixon's 1970 declaration, the FAA had placed
part-time, armed officers on some Florida flights to deter hijackings to
Cuba. But the hijackings to the Communist-ruled island continued in the
late 1960s until other measures, such as metal detectors at airports,
were adopted.</TE>
<TE>   The number of marshals peaked during the 1970s, and the program was
scaled back as hijackings dropped off. Then, in 1985, two Lebanese Shiite
terrorists commandeered a TWA jet from Athens. They severely beat, then
executed, U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem, a passenger on the flight.</TE>
<TE>   The Reagan administration then decided it was time to resurrect--and
reform--the marshals program. At the time, they were called "sky
marshals," and one of their chief duties involved escorting Mariel Cuban
convicts on special flights back to the island. The new program
envisioned the marshals as airborne counter-terrorist forces and changed
their name to federal air marshals.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't call them sky marshals," said Tyson, who helped develop
training and tactics for the reformed program. "All the 'sky marshals'
did was ferry homesick Cubans."</TE>
<TE>   Yet by 1993, as security at foreign airports improved, the need for
marshals was questioned. Cathal Flynn, a retired Navy admiral and then
head of FAA security, said he was called to a White House meeting early
in the Clinton years. Other federal law enforcement agencies were
concerned about the possibility that marshals could get into a shootout
with their agents.</TE>
<TE>   "In my view, the value of continuing the program outweighed these
concerns," Flynn said. The National Security Council agreed with him.</TE>
<TE>   Now, even with the backing of Bush and millions of new dollars flowing
in, former officials say the future of the air marshals remains
uncertain. The rapid buildup could undermine standards, such as shooting
qualifications for marshals and the team approach. Without a dramatic
"success story," such as a thwarted hijacking, some wonder whether
government budget-watchers may once again question the program's value.</TE>
<TE>   "My basic assessment is that I don't know that we are going to be able
to train that many people to the same high standards we were doing with
the lesser numbers," said Steele, the former Marine and FAA security
chief. "How do we get the same quality?"</TE>
<TE>   Billie H. Vincent, FAA security director from 1982 to 1986, said it's
time to take another look at the rationale for the marshals and their
mission. He advocates also using them to train and supervise a volunteer
corps of armed pilots--"pilot air marshals." That would greatly expand
the number of flights covered and provide an ongoing mission that could
bring stability to the marshals program, he said. However, arming pilots
remains a controversial idea.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, marshals may not be on every flight, but it seems that
passenger volunteers are. They can claim credit for subduing Richard
Reid, who boarded a Miami-bound plane in Paris with explosives in his
sneakers. In other cases, passengers have helped control travelers who
turned out to be more unruly than dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Observed Laird: "With the attitude present in today's fliers, I don't
think there is any real need for marshals."</TE>

<HD>India Sets Conditions for Talks</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Pakistan must stop terrorist infiltrations in Kashmir
before any negotiations can start, foreign minister says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>Telling Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to back up his words
with action, India said Sunday that its neighbor must stop terrorist
infiltrations before talks can begin on easing a dangerous military
standoff.</LD>
<LD>   Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh cautiously welcomed Gen.
Musharraf's promise Saturday that Pakistan's government will neither
support terrorists nor allow them to use its territory to attack anywhere
else in the world.</LD>
<LD>   But Singh insisted that Musharraf "must move purposefully" to end
cross-border terrorism, including strikes launched from bases inside
areas of the disputed territory of Kashmir that are under Pakistan's
control. Only then, he said, can the two nuclear powers begin
negotiations to end the crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Fighters still secretly cross into Indian-controlled territory in the
Himalayan region each day, Singh claimed. And while he acknowledged that
Musharraf needs time to show results, he would not say how long India is
willing to wait.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've said is, 'Between the declaration of intent, and the
implementation of what you have declared, let there be the least possible
time,' " Singh told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "The earlier it is implemented, the earlier both India and Pakistan
can move toward engaging in purposeful dialogue on all issues, including
on [the region of] Jammu and Kashmir. But we do wish to see the results
of what he has stated, and action on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf should start, Singh told reporters here, "by stopping all
infiltrations across the Line of Control," a 1972 cease-fire boundary
that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Saturday, Musharraf declared that "no organization will
be allowed to perpetuate terrorism in the garb of the Kashmiri cause,"
and he banned two Pakistani-based groups that India has blamed for a Dec.
13 attack on its Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said Pakistan will continue to provide "moral and
diplomatic" support for groups that Pakistan has long considered
legitimate freedom fighters but that India sees as terrorists.</TE>
<TE>Two Groups Banned</TE>
<TE>   Previous Pakistani governments have insisted that they provide only
this nonmilitary support to Kashmiri separatists. India, however, accuses
Pakistan's military of secretly training and arming the rebel fighters
and providing covering fire so they can slip into Indian-controlled
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed but didn't
explicitly accept India's claim that they were responsible for the Dec.
13 assault, which killed 14 people, including the five gunmen, who India
says were Pakistani citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Singh said Musharraf must make sure that the groups' "members do not
continue activities under other names," and he insisted that other
militias supported by Pakistan must also be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   The Harkat Moujahedeen, which Musharraf did not mention Saturday,
appeared on the State Department's list of world terrorist organizations
in 2000, and India says the group still has training camps in
Pakistani-controlled territory.</TE>
<TE>   The Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen claims to have 20,000 members; its leader,
Syed Salahuddin, also known as Yousuf Shah, is wanted in India on
terrorism charges.</TE>
<TE>   Although Musharraf did not refer to either of those groups in his
speech, Singh left no doubt that India wants them shut down too.</TE>
<TE>   If terrorist organizations continue to operate in any part of
Pakistan, including the areas of Kashmir under its control, "they are
directly violating the instructions of the president of Pakistan and
defying exactly what he has said," the Indian foreign minister
maintained.</TE>
<TE>   India's government is suspicious that Musharraf is making a tactical
move by banning extremist groups but has not yet made a strategic policy
shift away from supporting a guerrilla war in the Indian state of Jammu
and Kashmir, one that frequently targets civilians.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Pakistan's then-prime minister, Nawaz Sharif,
ordered a sharp reduction in clandestine support for the Jammu and
Kashmir Liberation Front, which wants full independence for the disputed
territory. But according to a senior Indian intelligence source
interviewed last week, groups fighting to merge the territory with
Pakistan got backing instead.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Badr Moujahedeen, another militia battling to end Indian rule
in Kashmir, and Lashkar-e-Taiba were quoted Sunday as vowing to continue
their armed struggle despite police raids on their offices. Members of
the two groups were among more than 1,500 Islamic militants rounded up in
the last few days, Pakistani police and media said today.</TE>
<TE>   Indian security forces, meanwhile, said they killed two knife-wielding
men who tried to attack guards Sunday at a Border Security Force camp.
The men, who were carrying Dutch passports, arrived in New Delhi on Dec.
27 and headed to Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu and
Kashmir state, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Musharraf spoke to his nation Saturday night, Singh said,
there was "heavier than normal" shelling from the Pakistani side of the
Line of Control in the area of Kargil, site of the last major battle
between India and Pakistan, in 1999. It is also a suspected infiltration
point for separatist fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of the reality in Pakistan," Singh said. "That's what I
mean by 'We're attempting to reduce the gap between statement and
action.' "</TE>
<TE>Bush Calls Both Leaders</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ken Lisaius said Sunday that President Bush had
called both Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to
urge their two nations to keep working to defuse tensions. Lisaius said
that he had no details on the conversations but that the president had
thanked Musharraf for his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Singh said that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had called him
Sunday morning, but he did not disclose details of their conversation.
Powell is scheduled to visit India and Pakistan later this week to press
for the easing of a situation that threatens to erupt into war.</TE>

<HD>Gaza Operation Draws Unusual Criticism in Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Cabinet ministers speak out against the demolition of
refugee homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAFAH, Gaza Strip
</DL>
<LD>The Israeli army's demolition of dozens of refugee homes on the
Gazan side of the border with Egypt triggered rare protests Sunday from
Cabinet ministers and journalists who branded the action excessive and
inhumane.</LD>
<LD>   "The destruction of homes causes us very bad media damage. In the
matter of destroying homes, we have to be very, very careful," Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres told Israel Radio. He went on to insist, however,
that Israel had demolished only unoccupied dwellings in the operation
Thursday. It did so, Peres said, to fight smuggling of arms from Egypt
through tunnels dug under the structures.</LD>
<LD>   Others were not so restrained in their criticism of an operation that
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency said destroyed 52 dwellings
and left 411 people homeless.</LD>
<TE>   Writing in the daily newspaper Haaretz, Zeev Schiff, a respected
military analyst, called the operation "destruction itself, an action
that reflects shamefully on the [Israel Defense Forces] and us all."</TE>
<TE>   In a front-page analysis, Schiff described the operation as "an act of
undisguised ruthlessness, a military act devoid of humanitarian and
diplomatic logic." He said it had been approved by the "top of the
political and military hierarchy," who imposed a single restriction: No
civilians should be killed.</TE>
<TE>   The army hotly disputed the U.N. agency's inventory of the destruction
and displacement. The army spokesman's office said 22 structures were
leveled and insisted that all of them were empty, their occupants having
been driven away months ago by fighting between Israeli troops and
Palestinian gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, the army's actions against Palestinian civilians elicit
little criticism from coalition members, the media or the public, who
regard road closures, sieges of Palestinian towns and villages and other
measures as defensive acts in a low-intensity conflict that began in
September 2000. But the size of the Rafah operation, and the fact that
the army did not say that the residents themselves were suspected of
terrorist actions, triggered the flurry of protests.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning, Cabinet ministers from the center-left Labor Party
criticized the demolitions on Israel Radio, saying images of homeless
families--most of them refugees--harm Israel's standing abroad. Salah
Tarif, a minister without portfolio, demanded that the government supply
anyone made homeless with a trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Culture and Sports Minister Matan Vilnai, a retired general, said
Israel needed to carry out the demolitions for security reasons but could
have eased the damage caused to families.</TE>
<TE>   "You can take four or five caravans [trailers] 600 meters [660 yards]
away and say: 'These are for you. In this area you can live,' " Vilnai
told Israel Radio. "A little thought and it could have been done
differently."</TE>
<TE>   The protesting ministers were in turn "harshly reprimanded" for their
comments by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer in the Cabinet meeting, Israel Radio said. Sharon reportedly
admonished ministers to wait for the army's version of events before
passing judgment, saying their comments aided anti-Israeli sentiment
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has destroyed hundreds of Palestinian homes since the outbreak
of fighting, but never on the scale carried out in the predawn hours
Thursday, a day after two Palestinian militants from Rafah shot four
Israeli military personnel to death at a nearby army outpost.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. relief agency initially said that the army destroyed 68 homes
in an area that it said houses 89,000 refugees. On Sunday, the agency
scaled back its count of the homes destroyed to 52 and said that 88
families, or 411 people, were displaced.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Hamad, deputy public information officer for the U.N. agency in
Gaza, said it based its final count on the testimony of families who said
they had been displaced and had applied to it for aid.</TE>
<TE>   The International Committee of the Red Cross put the number of
homeless at 93 families, or about 600 people, basing its figures on the
number of emergency kits it handed out to people who said they had been
displaced.</TE>
<TE>   B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, said it conducted a
"thorough investigation" at the site Thursday and found that 60 homes had
been destroyed and 112 families displaced.</TE>
<TE>   "House demolitions are a blatant violation of human rights and
contravene international humanitarian law, which forbids destruction of
property, collective punishment and reprisals," the organization said in
a press release.</TE>
<TE>   But the army insisted that the homes were empty shells serving as
cover for Palestinian gunmen who fired from them at patrolling Israeli
troops.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not see anyone leaving the homes, either before or during the
operation," Brig. Gen. Israel Ziv, commander of the Gaza Strip, told
Israel Radio.</TE>
<TE>   The "Block O" neighborhood, where the homes were demolished, has been
a hotbed of violence since the Palestinian revolt erupted.</TE>
<TE>   Gunmen routinely lob grenades at Israeli army outposts guarding the
border with Egypt and fire at the outposts and at Israeli patrols. The
army had previously destroyed homes in the area in an apparent effort to
create a buffer zone near the border. The U.N. agency said the army had
destroyed more than 200 homes in Rafah and nearby Khan Yunis before
Thursday's operation.</TE>
<TE>   According to witnesses, several bulldozers protected by tanks and
troops entered the densely populated neighborhood about 2 a.m. Thursday
and began knocking down buildings without warning, sending families
fleeing into a driving winter rain with little more than the clothes on
their backs.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, dozens of families gathered around U.N. Relief and Works
Agency Director Lionel Brisson as he visited the mounds of rubble left
behind by the army.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely sad," Brisson said, that so many people "are without
a roof in the middle of the winter." He said the agency planned to
rebuild the demolished homes in another part of Rafah.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds of displaced people waited for hours for Brisson to arrive at a
nearby U.N. storage facility to hand out $1,000 to $1,500 in emergency
cash assistance to each family.</TE>
<TE>   "At 1 o'clock, the Jews started shooting, and after that, the
bulldozers came and we started escaping," said Hanan abu Lubda, 34, a
pregnant mother of 10. "I ran out, and in the confusion I forgot my
youngest daughter. I ran back and got her and went to the neighbor's.
When I returned at 3 a.m., I found nothing left."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. donated tents to the families, but U.N. social workers
explained that most displaced people stay with relatives until they can
find a place to rent.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter woke me up when the bulldozers came," said Sabha abu
Jawza, a divorced mother of nine. "I escaped with nothing except the
children." The emergency money from the U.N., she said, will hardly begin
to put her life back together.</TE>
<TE>   "We need houses, not money. We need a home and land," Abu Jawza said.
"They give us money to rent, but it will be gone soon. What are we going
to do then?" she said.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Takes a Bold, Risky Step Toward New Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: President's initiatives cracking down on Islamic extremists
may embolden religious moderates, some political analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf has, in effect, launched a jihad against
Islamic extremism and the seeds of terror and violence it sows. If fully
implemented and successfully executed, the campaign could change the
character of this impoverished and often unstable country.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign was announced Saturday in a televised speech to the
nation during which Musharraf, a four-star general, wore civilian clothes
and frequently invoked the teachings of the Koran to justify his actions.
Seldom has the leader of any Islamic nation used such blunt language to
attack religious extremists or publicly announced such bold initiatives
to usurp the zealots' influence. At stake, many analysts say, is the
destiny of Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   The radicals, Musharraf scoffed, "are people who try to monopolize and
attempt to propagate their own brand of religion. They think as if others
are not Muslims. These are the people who considered the Taliban to be a
symbol of Islam and that the Taliban were bringing Islamic renaissance or
were practicing the purest form of Islam."</LD>
<TE>   Some political analysts believe that Musharraf's message--combined
with the collapse of the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan, which left
extremists feeling humiliated and dejected--could embolden religious
liberals in the Islamic world. Moderate voices, whether of governments or
individuals, have long been silent as the zealous minority used fear and
violence to garner an influence that grew out of proportion to its
numerical strength.</TE>
<TE>   The measures Musharraf announced include bringing mosques and
religious schools under government scrutiny, if not outright control.
Five groups widely believed to be involved in internal or external
terrorism were banned, as was the widespread use of loudspeakers to
propagate hate-filled and inflammatory harangues. Upward of 300
extremists were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf went on to denounce terrorism in all forms and said--in
reference to the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir, where military
tensions between Pakistan and India are volatile--that he will not allow
Pakistan to be used for attacks on other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Religious parties reacted with predictable scorn to Musharraf's
crackdown. Some said they would challenge it in court, and others
threatened to go underground. But mainstream media, which frequently are
a good gauge of Pakistani public opinion, were supportive. Some of the
newspapers and their reporters have been the victims of violent attacks
by religious extremists.</TE>
<TE>   "President Musharraf," editorialized the News, "has taken the bull of
religious extremism and fundamentalism by its horns. It [is] clear that
Pakistan had too long been exploited in the name of Islam."</TE>
<TE>   The Nation commented that Musharraf "has certainly impressed his
countrymen with his resolve to do what he thinks is right, rather than
merely expedient."</TE>
<TE>   On the dispute with India, Musharraf conveyed both firmness and
flexibility by directly challenging Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee to begin talks aimed at a peaceful solution and saying that
Pakistani armed forces would "spill the last drop of their blood"
defending their country if it was attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf apparently will have met most of India's demands if he makes
good on his promise to stop terrorism--much of which emanates from
Kashmir, where anti-Indian militants include Arabs who fought in
Afghanistan. At the same time, he appeased his countrymen by refusing to
hand over to India 20 accused Pakistani or Kashmiri terrorists. India and
Pakistan do not have an extradition treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the non-Muslim international community praised Musharraf's
moves, aware that they were taken at considerable personal risk in an
Islamic republic. Marc Ginsberg, a former U.S. ambassador appearing on
Fox TV, described the speech as "another profile in courage." British
Prime Minister Tony Blair lauded Musharraf's "defense of a tolerant and
moderate Islam," and a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry noted
"the positive tone of Musharraf's intention to end activity in Kashmir."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf started cracking down on extremists in August--a month
before the terrorist attacks on the United States--and Western diplomats
are convinced that he is sincere in his desire to end terrorism and earn
Pakistan international respect. They also are aware that by joining the
U.S.-led coalition against terrorism, Musharraf was handed an opportunity
to recast both his image and that of his country.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, Musharraf led a military junta. Most of the world's
top terrorists had passed through Pakistan at one time or another. Few
world leaders would think of receiving Musharraf. The United States had
imposed sanctions on his country. Bankruptcy threatened.</TE>
<TE>   But in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, Musharraf did his policy
somersault, ending support for the Taliban and denouncing the scourge of
terrorism and extremism, which he said had "ruined" Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Sanctions were lifted, aid money started flowing in, Blair
and a delegation of U.S. senators came calling. The slate was wiped
clean. Musharraf and Pakistan were starting over as the darlings of the
West in the war against terrorism.</TE>

<HD>Iran-Palestinian Alliance Poses Major Threat, Israel Leader Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon denounced Sunday what he termed
a "very dangerous" alliance between the Palestinian Authority and Iran
that has already resulted in the shipment of tons of weapons to the
region and poses a serious threat to the future of the Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   Striking a characteristically uncompromising note, Sharon rebuffed all
suggestions that he resume negotiations with the Palestinians until they
meet an expanding list of conditions and demands.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon was speaking to a gathering of foreign journalists and embassy
press attaches in Jerusalem, his second such appearance since he took
office 10 months ago.</LD>
<TE>   Casting Israel's conflict with the Palestinians as an existential
struggle, he said that the current violence, in which more than 1,000
people have been killed since fall 2000, is part of a continuum of "120
years of terror" that will not end soon.</TE>
<TE>   The latest twist in the conflict, he noted, was Israel's interception
this month of a ship transporting 50 tons of advanced weapons. Israeli
military officials, and the vessel's Palestinian captain, have said the
arms came from Iran and were destined for the Palestinian Authority. The
Palestinian Authority has formally denied involvement in the foiled
smuggling operation, despite the implication of three of the authority's
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We are facing . . . the involvement of Iran in our area here, which
we regard to be a very dangerous development," Sharon said. A link
between the Palestinian Authority and Iran--"terrorism center of the
world"--will make it all but impossible to offer political concessions to
the Palestinians, Sharon said, although he also made it clear that he
wasn't inclined to do that anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military and government officials say the weapons shipment
confirmed that Iranian hard-liners are trying to use the militant
Lebanese Hezbollah organization to gain a foothold in the
Palestinian-ruled West Bank and Gaza Strip. A Hezbollah operative was
reported to have aided in training the crew on the weapons ship, the
Karine-A. The Israeli officials allege that Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat personally ordered subordinates to establish
contacts with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Iran, however, denies any security ties to Arafat or the Palestinian
Authority. Iran has been hostile toward Arafat because of his 1993
decision to enter into peace negotiations with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Eran Lerman, a recently retired Israeli military intelligence officer,
said it was likely that certain hard-line elements of the Iranian
establishment, such as supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, were involved in the arms shipment.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah, which has had some of its activities curtailed in Lebanon,
would probably serve as the go-between, said Lerman, who heads the
Jerusalem office of the American Jewish Committee. With Iran's backing,
Hezbollah successfully waged a protracted war of attrition against
occupying Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, finally forcing Israel to
withdraw in 2000, and it has become a role model for many Palestinian
fighters. Several attempts by Hezbollah to infiltrate Palestinian
territory were detected by the Israeli army last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority said over the weekend that it had arrested
the three Palestinian officials implicated by Israel and by the
Karine-A's crew in the smuggling operation. Later, however, Palestinian
officials sought to "clarify" their statement, acknowledging that two of
the three officials were not even in Palestinian territory. The true
status of the third, a close associate of Arafat, was unclear.</TE>

<HD>Bodies of Marines Killed in Crash Are Brought Home</HD>
<DH>Military: Search continues for last of seven victims of plane
accident in Pakistan. Meanwhile, 30 more prisoners head for Cuba.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The remains of five Marines killed last week in a plane crash in
Pakistan were returned home Sunday night, while the search for one of two
other crew members continued, a military spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The aircraft bearing the bodies arrived shortly before midnight Sunday
at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Central Command officials in Tampa, Fla., had said they were
expecting the remains of six of the Marines to be on the flight, but
authorities at Dover said there were only five coffins.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. aircraft continued to bomb Al Qaeda training bases in
the area of Zhawar Kili al Badr, near Khowst, in eastern Afghanistan. The
repeated airstrikes, which have gone on for several days, are intended to
prevent Al Qaeda and Taliban forces from using a large network of caves
and tunnels as a staging area to escape into Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, an additional 30 Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners were put
on a transport plane for the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
where prison facilities are being built to eventually house up to 2,000
inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's plane crash caused the single largest loss of life for
U.S. forces involved in the Afghan campaign. The seven crew members
belonged to a squadron based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Their KC-130, a four-engine turboprop used as a cargo transport and
aerial refueling tanker, crashed while on a nighttime landing approach to
a military base in Shamsi, Pakistan, near the Afghan border.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Lt. Col. Martin Compton, a spokesman for the U.S. Central
Command, which directs military operations in Afghanistan, said
investigators had not yet established the cause of the crash, although
enemy fire had been ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very steep and mountainous terrain, and they were coming in for
a landing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of the Marines were flown to U.S. Rhein-Main Air Base in
Frankfurt, Germany, Compton said. From there they were taken to a
military medical facility in Landstuhl, Germany, for preparation. Bad
weather in Europe on Sunday temporarily delayed return of the remains,
which were flown to the United States later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   The crew members were identified as Capt. Matthew W. Bancroft, 29, of
Redding, Calif., the pilot; Capt. Daniel G. McCollum, 29, of Irmo, S. C.,
the co-pilot; Gunnery Sgt. Stephen L. Bryson, 36, of Montgomery, Ala.;
Staff Sgt. Scott N. Germosen, 37, of New York; Sgt. Nathan P. Hays, 21,
of Wilbur, Wash.; Lance Cpl. Bryan P. Bertrand, 23, of Coos Bay, Ore.;
and Sgt. Jeanette L. Winters, 25, of Gary, Ind., the radio operator. The
Pentagon has not released the identities of the six Marines whose remains
have been recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Another crew and plane from Squadron 352 at Miramar will take the
place of the lost craft.</TE>
<TE>   The airport in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, where the KC-130s
are based, was the scene late Sunday of the second transfer of prisoners
to Cuba. The 30 prisoners were shackled and their faces covered as they
boarded a C-17 cargo jet for the flight to Guantanamo, in the island's
easternmost province.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. base at the Kandahar airport was on high alert. Most lights
were shut off, and canine details and Humvees with 50-caliber machine
guns patrolled the area. The base is the main detention center in
Afghanistan for Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners and as such could be a
target for a raid to free the captives.</TE>
<TE>   A group of 20 prisoners made the flight to Cuba last week. More than
460 Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners are in U.S. custody--at Guantanamo
Bay, the Kandahar base and Bagram air base in Afghanistan, and on the
amphibious assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea.</TE>

<DL>SYDNEY, Australia
</DL>
<LD>The Australian Broadcasting Corp. has obtained videotapes it said
showed Al Qaeda militants rehearsing an attack on world leaders at a golf
tournament and on a motorcade in what appears to be Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The network late Sunday aired parts of the videos recorded at an Al
Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, which showed what ABC said were
English-speaking Arab, Pakistani and African fighters rehearsing
hostage-takings and assassinations.</LD>
<LD>   The network said the tapes would be sent to the United States for
analysis by military intelligence.</LD>
<TE>   The tapes were discovered by the Northern Alliance in a camp near
Kabul shortly after the Taliban regime fled the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is hunting Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader
Washington has accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since the rout of the Taliban last month, various news organizations
have stumbled on bomb-making pamphlets, training manuals and other
documents in abandoned camps believed to have been run by Bin Laden's
organization.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC said the amateur videotapes were handed to its reporters by
Northern Alliance officials.</TE>
<TE>   Running for more than six hours, they show Al Qaeda members rehearsing
hostage-taking scenarios and assassinations, according to the extracts.</TE>
<TE>   The exercises included detailed plans to attack a motorcade on what
appeared to be a road system in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In another scenario, trainees with weapons hidden in golf bags carried
out a rocket launcher attack on dummies apparently meant to represent
world leaders at a golf tournament.</TE>

<LD>Rescuers found a Boy Scout troop, missing overnight while on a
canoe trip along a creek in central Florida near Eustis, after one of the
boys' parents tracked them down using a cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Cecil Garrett of the Lake County Sheriff's Office said authorities
picked up the 10 boys, ages 11 to 17, and two adult scoutmasters and
drove them to safety.</LD>
<LD>   Delayed by high water and fallen trees that choked the creek, the
scouts from Palm Bay, Fla., failed to reach their rendezvous point by
nightfall, camping out instead in a cold rain, without any shelter or
protection from the elements.</LD>
<TE>   The scouts carried no food, sleeping bags or warm clothing to protect
them from nighttime temperatures that dropped into the low 40s.</TE>

<HD>Judge Denies Young Iraqi's Bid to Join Family</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Jurist rejects claim that teen will be forced to
engage in terrorist activities if he is deported from the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>He arrived in America just three days before terrorists struck on
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Immediately after landing at Miami International Airport, Doraid
Joussef Suleiman declared himself a refugee from the regime of Saddam
Hussein in Iraq. The 18-year-old's hope was to join much of the rest of
his family already living in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Suleiman told U.S. authorities that he had fled his homeland because
the Iraqi government was about to conscript him into the military; if he
returned, he said, he would likely be tortured if not killed. U.S.
officials examined his case and determined there was indeed a possibility
that he might be harmed if he was sent back.</LD>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Suleiman remains confined at the giant Krome Detention Facility
near here. And a U.S. immigration judge--while acknowledging Suleiman's
fears--has ordered him deported to Iraq, saying "every country has the
right to require its citizens to join the military."</TE>
<TE>   The judge noted that Suleiman used a phony passport to get into the
United States and that once he arrived, he lied to U.S. immigration
officials about how long it took him to get to America.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows for certain whether Suleiman would still be in limbo if
terrorists had not crashed hijacked planes into the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon. The judge in his ruling did not address any Sept. 11
concerns, and there is no hint in the record that Suleiman was ever
considered a terrorist suspect.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four months, hundreds of Middle Easterners have been
detained in the investigation of the terrorist attacks. Suleiman is an
example of someone from that part of the world who was detained before
Sept. 11 and remains in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Suleiman, his family and his attorney claim that he is fleeing
Hussein's terrorist regime.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney, Hina Askari of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., had high hopes of
reuniting him with his family. Now her office is appealing the judge's
deportation order from last month. If they lose, he could be gone by
February.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a young kid and very brave," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Suleiman's older brother, Fawzi Suliman of Las Vegas, who altered the
spelling of his last name after becoming a U.S. citizen, has helped other
family members get to the U.S., including their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a job working for me ready for him if he could get to Las
Vegas," his brother said. "And if he's going back, he's going back to be
persecuted and he's going back to be killed."</TE>
<TE>   In a brief telephone interview, with his brother acting as
interpreter, Suleiman said in Arabic that he "really wanted to come to
America to be with my family." Asked what would happen if he is forced to
return to Iraq, he said, "They will probably kill me because I'm a
refugee in the United States, and that's a very good reason that they
will prosecute me."</TE>
<TE>   A copy of Judge Kenneth S. Hurewitz's order lays out the case for and
against Suleiman and gives the judge's explanation for denying Suleiman's
request.</TE>
<TE>   The judge acknowledged Suleiman's fears, but ultimately decided that
Suleiman had not proved he would be tortured or killed if he returned to
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Suleiman told the judge that he was born in Baghdad, never married and
has no children. His family are Iraqi Christians, and his parents are
permanent U.S. residents.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest in the family, Suleiman left Iraq in 1998 with his
parents when they went to Jordan to keep their son out of the Iraqi
military. The parents' U.S. residency was approved, and they came to
America, while the youth, whose visa did not come through, remained
behind with family friends.</TE>
<TE>   He began seeking entry to the U.S. on his own in 1999, applying for
U.S. refugee status while still in Jordan, according to his brother,
Fawzi. But, he said, "the INS ignored everything he tried and they
wouldn't respond to his requests."</TE>
<TE>   The brother said the family finally decided to have Suleiman come here
illegally and plead his case in U.S. immigration court. "We thought it
would be easier that way."</TE>
<TE>   Suleiman eventually moved to Ecuador, staying with relatives there for
six months, and then went to Chile. After two days there, he paid a
smuggler named "Maher" $6,000 for a phony German passport under the name
of "George Nelson." Suleiman destroyed the document after boarding a
plane for Miami. His real passport was left behind with a cousin in
Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   When he walked off the plane, Suleiman declared himself a refugee.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's ruling noted that Suleiman "testified that he left Iraq
because the ruling party came to his school to recruit him and others for
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was asked to sign up for what he called 'special forces,'
not the regular army. He did not want to sign because Saddam is a
terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination by government lawyers, Suleiman acknowledged
none of his older brothers was forced into the military, including one
who did not leave Iraq until he was 27.</TE>
<TE>   Askari, Suleiman's attorney, told the judge that "this is a special
situation because Saddam Hussein is a terrorist" and that her client
would "be forced to be a terrorist" if he joined the military.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers countered that "the only reason he does not want to
return to Iraq is because he is 18 years old and does not want to serve
in the military."</TE>
<TE>   The judge sided with the government.</TE>
<TE>   "Every country has the right to require its citizens to join the
military," Hurewitz ruled. And "conscription may be a ground for asylum
if one would be required to engage in internationally condemned conduct
or where other special circumstances exist."</TE>
<TE>   But the judge said that "there is no evidence that the military per se
commits acts of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "If we accept [Suleiman's] argument, then all Iraqis of military age
would be entitled to asylum."</TE>
<TE>   Hurewitz also said "there is no evidence to support" Suleiman's
contention that he will be tortured upon his return to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "While it is true that the Iraqi government is controlled by Saddam
Hussein and there are many human rights abuses," Suleiman and his lawyer
could not prove that "severe physical or mental suffering" awaits him in
Iraq, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, Hurewitz denied the young man's three-year odyssey to live
in the U.S.</TE>

<HD>New Era Means Trimming Tax Cut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration and its allies have settled on their best
line of defense against escalating Democratic charges that the
president's tax cut squandered the massive budget surplus and plunged the
government back into deficit. The problem, they're arguing, isn't the tax
cut, it's that everything else has changed.</LD>
<LD>   Which is exactly the best argument for changing the tax cut.</LD>
<LD>   Although he's slighting the impact of the tax cut, President Bush has
every right to pin much of the blame for the near-term deficits on
recession and the cost of responding to Sept. 11. When Bush took office,
the Congressional Budget Office projected a cumulative surplus over his
first term of $1.35 trillion. Now, his administration is expecting
deficits every year through 2004 and probably 2005, before projected
surpluses return. Over that period, the tax cut Bush pushed through
Congress last spring is expected to cost $344 billion. So Bush is right
that the tax cut alone can't be responsible for what Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) this month termed "the most dramatic fiscal
deterioration in our nation's history."</LD>
<TE>   But by underscoring the enormous impact of recession and the war, Bush
inadvertently undermines his case for staying the course on the tax cut.
In effect, the president is arguing that because everything has changed
since Congress approved the tax cut last spring, we should continue to
cut taxes as if nothing had happened.</TE>
<TE>   One of the principal arguments Bush made for his tax cut was that if
Congress didn't return the vast projected surpluses to the taxpayers,
government would spend them. Now, as he's acknowledging, recession means
federal revenue will be much smaller, even as the government must fund
critical defense and homeland security upgrades. The latest congressional
estimates are that the government budget surpluses over the next decade
may be only one-third as large as those projected when Bush signed the
tax cut. And almost all of that shrunken surplus will come from taxes
earmarked for Social Security, which is in the black only until baby
boomers begin retiring in large numbers. Bush doesn't have to worry
anymore about big government getting its hands on the surplus: There's no
surplus to grab.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11, both parties had agreed to reserve the Social Security
surplus mostly to pay down the national debt. But the budget has
deteriorated so fast that it now appears Washington will be forced to use
Social Security money to pay for other government programs and the tax
cut through at least 2008. That diversion condemns future taxpayers to a
larger federal debt, higher interest costs to service that debt and
higher taxes to pay that interest.</TE>
<TE>   Which means that by using Social Security money to fund the tax cuts,
we are raising taxes on our children to reduce them on ourselves.
Compounding the problem, for at least the next few years the federal
government is expected to consume all of its general revenue, all of the
money raised for Social Security and still be forced to increase the
national debt to pay for its operations--all while reducing taxes. These
are hardly scenarios that fit the American ideal of sacrificing for the
next generation.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there's no real precedent in U.S. history for cutting taxes at
the start of a war. However reluctantly, Americans have always accepted
higher taxes as the price those at home pay to support those under fire.
The first income tax was imposed to pay for the Civil War; in World War I
and World War II, income tax rates were raised to unprecedented heights.
During Vietnam, Americans shouldered a 10% income tax surcharge.</TE>
<TE>   Today, no one in either party is talking about tax increases. The only
question is whether the country can still afford further installments of
the Bush tax cut scheduled mostly for 2004 and 2006, particularly those
that will benefit the top earners. Those further reductions--which will
bring down the top income tax rate paid by the highest earners from 38.6%
today to 35% by 2006--are a central reason why the tax cut is projected
to cost almost twice as much from 2006 through 2008 as it does from 2002
through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   That rising bill for the tax plan will arrive even as the government
faces enormous demands for defense and homeland security unimagined when
the cuts were approved. Pentagon officials have recently disclosed that
they will seek a $20-billion budget increase next year. Homeland Security
Director Thomas J. Ridge has signaled he may seek as much as $35 billion
to fortify America's internal defenses.</TE>
<TE>   Assume the increased spending on homeland security and the Pentagon
next year conservatively totals about $55 billion. Over 10 years, with
inflation, that would amount to $632 billion in federal obligations that
weren't anticipated when Congress approved the tax cut--plus nearly $190
billion more in added interest costs that come from using that money for
the new spending, rather than paying down the national debt. Is it really
plausible Congress would have agreed to cut taxes as much as it did if it
knew it would be facing those unavoidable bills over the next 10 years?
The question answers itself.</TE>
<TE>   Even before last year's tax cut, the tax burden on most Americans was
already moderating. Largely because of the children's tax credit and
other changes approved in 1997, all but the top 20% of Americans were
paying a smaller share of their income in federal income taxes during
President Clinton's second term than they were when President Reagan left
office, according to a recent Congressional Budget Office analysis. The
conservative Tax Foundation has calculated that the federal income tax
burden on average families is now as low as it was in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, in a perfect world, that burden should be lower still. But
there's nothing perfect about a world in which mass murderers slam jumbo
jets into office towers, killing thousands and compelling billions of
dollars in expenditures to prevent more attacks. The tax cut is the
product of a peaceful era that has vaporized; to borrow from Abraham
Lincoln, it is a relic of a "quiet past" unsuited for the "stormy
present." Trimming the tax cut now would be less a repudiation of the
initial decision than a simple recognition of changed circumstance. With
the country facing such an unprecedented challenge, rarely has there been
a better time to heed Lincoln's counsel to "think anew and act anew."</TE>

authorities say a New Jersey ATM serviceman stole from automated teller
machines.</LD>
<LD>   Agents wouldn't say how much money they found Friday. They previously
recovered $3.5 million at an abandoned Boynton Beach home, and $68,000
from a safe deposit box.</LD>

from the van of ATM serviceman Michael Schwartz. LaCroix is charged with
receipt and possession of stolen money.</LD>
<TE>   Schwartz, 36, was found dead on Christmas Day, after a two-week
drinking binge, in an apartment that he briefly shared with LaCroix.</TE>

<LD>State motor vehicle officials plan to ask Congress today for up to
$100 million to create a national identification system that would
include high-tech driver's licenses and a network of tightly linked
databases of driver information.</LD>
<LD>   The appeal by the American Assn. of Motor Vehicle Administrators comes
after authorities determined that some Sept. 11 hijackers used false
identities and obtained driver's licenses illegally.</LD>
<LD>   Today, an association task force plans to issue a report that calls on
states to standardize their licensing procedures, improve their

<HD>Mutated Gene Linked to Lactose Tolerance</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A genetic mutation allows people to tolerate milk after they leave
babyhood and is virtually the same in people of Asian, European and
African descent, researchers reported.</LD>
<LD>   Finding the tiny change in the genetic code should allow scientists an
easy test for lactose intolerance, a painful digestive condition, the
team of U.S. and Finnish researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   Lactose intolerance was known to be genetic, caused by a recessive
gene, meaning that a person has to inherit a copy from each parent to be
lactose intolerant.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first time this mutation, the DNA change, is actually
identified," said Dr. Leena Peltonen, a UCLA geneticist who led the
study.</TE>

<HD>Officials Defend Not Sounding Alarm on Enron</HD>
<DH>Cabinet: O'Neill of Treasury and Evans of Commerce argue that
employees and investors already knew of the company's troubles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Senior Bush administration officials defended themselves Sunday for
not alerting the president and the public that thousands of employees and
investors were likely to lose large amounts of money in the failing Enron
Corp., arguing that the giant energy company already was doomed by the
time its executives began to seek help from Washington last fall.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Treasury Secretary  Paul H. O'Neill said that "in the
broad scheme of things," he was not necessarily surprised that Enron
sought U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection Dec. 2.</LD>
<LD>   "Companies come and go," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "Part of the
genius of capitalism is people get to make good decisions, or bad
decisions, and they get to pay the consequence or to enjoy the fruits of
their decisions. That's the way the system works."</LD>
<TE>   O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans said that when Enron
executives began to contact them for help in October, the company's
shareholders already knew that the stock was falling and could have made
their own decisions to sell their shares at that time.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders did not need the federal government to advise them how to
safeguard their investments, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   That, O'Neill said, was a key reason he did not immediately alert
President Bush or suggest that the administration do something to stave
off the financial ruin of the Houston-based company, once the world's
leading energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think there was any reason for me to talk to anybody else,"
O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not new news. . . . You all had been reporting for weeks that
Enron had problems, that they were in trouble."</TE>
<TE>McCain: Agencies Must Be Held Accountable</TE>
<TE>   The secretary added that he likewise did not think it important to
tell Bush that Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay had called him with concerns
about the company's well-being.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," O'Neill said, "I have been involved in big-league events
for, I don't know, most of the last 40 years. I didn't think this was
worthy of me running across the street telling the president. I don't go
across the street and tell the president every time somebody calls me."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's argument that the government should stay out of affairs in
the business sector, even when officials fear that such a large number of
people stand to lose, drew fire from some leaders in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand what Mr. O'Neill is saying, that capitalism is a risk
business," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), ranking member on the Senate
Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But McCain suggested that something should have been done to help the
21,000 Enron employees and thousands of other stockholders who saw their
retirement packages and other investments disappear. Because of a change
in plan administrators, Enron employees were blocked from selling company
shares in their retirement accounts for a four-week period in October and
November, when the stock took its most precipitous plunge.</TE>
<TE>   "We care about our citizens, and the regulatory agencies and oversight
agencies must be held accountable," McCain said on CBS' "Face the
Nation." "The government does have a role to protect innocent people."</TE>
<TE>   Evans, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," said he also believed at
the time that shareholders were well aware of Enron's continuing
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know anything they didn't know," he said of shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken didn't tell me anything that wasn't already in the public domain
and publicly disclosed," Evans said, referring to Lay. " . . . Everything
he told me was already in the public domain. The public knew about it.
The shareholders knew about it. Wall Street knew about it."</TE>
<TE>   Evans further argued that it would have been wrong for him to step in
as Commerce secretary and seek to have the company saved if it was going
to declare bankruptcy anyway a month or so later.</TE>
<TE>   "What do I say to the lady who bought the stock that day, that put her
life savings into the stock that day?" if the government had intervened,
Evans said. And if the company then went under, he asked, "what do I say
to her" then?</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Commerce Committee is among several congressional panels
and government agencies investigating aspects of the Enron bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "With all respect to Secretary O'Neill, those statements [about
capitalism] are outrageous," said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.),
chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which also is probing the
company's collapse. "They sound more coldblooded than he means to be."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, also speaking on "Face the Nation," said that capitalism
aside, Enron executives could have saved the investments of employees and
shareholders at the same time they were watching out for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that they were saying things to the public, to shareholders,
the retirees . . . about how the stock was going to go up, and at the
same time, they were selling their stock right then," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The senator added: "This was not a natural death. . . . This was not
capitalism as we want it to be."</TE>

<HD>Medical Oversight on Trial Along With Doctor</HD>
<DH>Health: Case involves two patients who nearly died. It raises
issues about state regulation, lack of malpractice insurance and the
fairness of criminal prosecutions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERENCE MONMANEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The prosecution of Dr. Gerald J. McCann is not just another
testament to the awful things that can happen to women pursuing the ideal
body.</LD>
<LD>   It highlights the problem of doctors who, like McCann, don't carry
malpractice insurance, and it calls into question the performance of
state officials whose job is to protect patients.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles County grand jury has indicted McCann, 66, for his
treatment of two women who nearly died after he performed liposuction on
them. He faces two felony counts of exceeding the level of anesthesia
allowed in his former clinic, which was in Santa Fe Springs and was not
licensed as a surgery center. He denies the charges, and his trial began
last week.</LD>
<TE>   Rarely is a physician charged with a felony for causing a patient's
suffering. But much about the tortuous, nearly five-year case is
extraordinary, including its implications for medical practice.</TE>
<TE>   To McCann and the California Medical Assn., a conviction would set a
far-reaching precedent of holding physicians criminally responsible when
patients develop complications--a precedent they claim would ultimately
harm consumers by inhibiting physicians' judgment and scaring many out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   To the prosecutor, the case shows that people often know too little
about the doctors whom they entrust with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   That certainly applied to Idalia Lopez, of Downey. Not long after she
turned 43, a classified ad in the Pennysaver caught her eye. "Wrinkle
removal," it said, "better than anything seen on TV." Another ad on the
page touted "LIPOSUCTION . . . Guaranteed lowest prices."</TE>
<TE>   She met with McCann, who placed the ads, and he gave her facial peels.
Then she paid half of the $2,500 liposuction fee and underwent the
fat-vacuuming procedure one Saturday night in his clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Over several hours, he removed more than three liters of fat and
fluids and two liters of blood from her belly, hips and thighs, medical
records show. She was still groggy from anesthesia when a clinic
assistant and Lopez's husband lifted her into the family van at 3:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   McCann said she would be back at her job as a teacher's assistant in a
day or two. That didn't happen. Inch by inch, skin on her belly and legs
turned gray and died. A dangerous infection poisoned her blood. Her
intestines quit. Her kidneys quit.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a week, McCann said Lopez would bounce back. When an
ambulance finally took her to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, a
doctor there said she would have been dead in another hour.</TE>
<TE>   The liposuction price was a bargain. But the five weeks she spent in
the hospital's intensive care unit, undergoing kidney dialysis and
multiple skin grafts, among many other treatments, cost $537,501. And
there were more expenses to come.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very depressed," Lopez, a Guatemala native and mother of four,
said the other day. She no longer works because of the pain in her legs.
She's ashamed of the mottled skin on her legs and belly. She and her
husband, who owns a maintenance business, are buried under $800,000 in
medical bills.</TE>
<TE>   "My life changed because of the damage he caused me," she said of
McCann.</TE>
<TE>   Her sister, Connie Giron, a schoolteacher, was more blunt: "The
incident totally destroyed her life."</TE>
<TE>   As Lopez lay in the hospital bed in March 1997, McCann did a
liposuction on Yvonne Donnell-Behringer.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, she contracted necrotizing fasciitis, the infection also
known as flesh-eating bacteria. It killed skin from her groin to her
chest. She, too, was taken to an emergency room, dying.</TE>
<TE>   She spent three months at a Whittier hospital undergoing skin grafts,
kidney dialysis and other treatments.</TE>
<TE>   A plastic surgery expert who reviewed the cases for the state medical
board concluded that McCann's care of the two women was "shockingly
inadequate" and that allowing him to engage in the practice of medicine
"would endanger the public health, safety and welfare."</TE>
<TE>   The two women, disfigured in similar ways, set out to fight McCann in
court, only to find that he would thwart them.</TE>
<TE>Surgeon Denies Patients' Charges</TE>
<TE>   Donnell-Behringer's malpractice suit went first, in September 1999,
charging multiple acts of negligence.</TE>
<TE>   McCann said in an interview that Donnell-Behringer caused her
infection by soiling the bandages he gave her to wear after the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   It was also her fault, he said, because "if she hadn't asked for the
operation, it wouldn't have happened."</TE>
<TE>   But the jury didn't buy his defense, and in January 2000 awarded her
$903,000. The judge reduced it to $660,000, in keeping with a state law
that caps pain and suffering awards in malpractice verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's lawsuit went even further. She accused McCann of not only
negligence but also malicious wrongdoing. The suit alleged he
misrepresented himself as qualified to perform liposuction; relied on
untrained and improperly licensed medical personnel to assist him; and
nearly killed Lopez when he tried to hide his mistakes by not referring
her immediately to a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   McCann denied the charges, saying his liposuction training consisted
of watching videotapes of doctors performing the procedure and attending
medical conferences where it was discussed or demonstrated. As a board
certified orthopedic surgeon, he said he was qualified to do cosmetic
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   He blames Lopez. She "wouldn't cooperate" with him and was "weak and
sickly," he said in an interview. She neglected his instructions to
exercise and drink enough fluids, he said, causing her dehydration and
kidney failure.</TE>
<TE>   The only mistake he acknowledged in interviews was not sending Lopez
to a hospital right away. "I just kept thinking, 'She's got to pull
through this,' " he said. "I was wrong on that. She wasn't pulling
through."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Lopez never got to hear him admit anything in court--and
Donnell-Behringer didn't get a penny of her jury award.</TE>
<TE>   Days after Donnell-Behringer's court victory, McCann, who had no
malpractice insurance, filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, with nothing to gain, dropped her lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   McCann said Lopez and Donnell-Behringer hurt themselves by, as he put
it, "going for the gold"--suing him rather than accepting his settlement
offer. He wouldn't say how much he offered. Lopez said it was $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who threw the dice on this thing and they came out
with no funds from me," McCann said of the women.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the first time he dodged creditors. In 1992, he obtained
bankruptcy protection for his medical corporation because, he said,
managed care had so reduced his fees he couldn't pay his bills.</TE>
<TE>   But court records show he obtained bankruptcy protection after a jury
hit him with a $501,000 malpractice verdict. A man with back pain had
sued McCann for operating on the wrong spinal vertebra and trying to
cover up the mistake. McCann had no malpractice insurance at the time. He
said in an interview that he later paid the patient a settlement. The
patient and his lawyer could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Not all physicians in California have to carry liability insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals and health maintenance networks often cover their staff
physicians, and since 1999 the state has mandated insurance for
physicians doing surgery in outpatient clinics. But doctors don't have to
carry insurance or disclose it when they don't.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, state lawmakers proposed a regulation requiring physicians
and dentists who don't have liability coverage to tell prospective
patients. But others in the Legislature opposed the bill as too limited,
arguing that it would be better to mandate that all doctors carry
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's attorney argued that McCann was not just negligent but
reckless, given his history.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows he's operating without insurance, he knows he's not trained
[in liposuction], and he knows he's judgment-proof" because he can just
declare bankruptcy, attorney Buffy Lynn Roney said.</TE>
<TE>   "That creates a very dangerous man."</TE>
<TE>Worked as Barber Before Medical School</TE>
<TE>   McCann came up the hard way. Born in the Kern County town of Taft, he
drifted to Los Angeles as a teenager, went to barber school in the 1950s,
then put himself through community college and UCLA giving haircuts. He
went to medical school at UC Irvine and served in the Army as a surgeon
in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   A father of five grown children, the Whittier man said he has spent
decades treating poor patients from East Los Angeles when he could have
had it easy, setting bones on the Westside. He sees himself as the victim
of overzealous regulators, and said he has done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "The medical board feels an obligation to make Dr. McCann bleed," he
said. The Medical Board of California has been investigating McCann for
three years and has been trying revoke his license for more than two
years. The delays, said a board spokesperson, are caused by
understaffing. To discipline a physician, the board must prevail at
multiple hearings and appeals, beginning with an administrative law
judge.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1999, the medical board argued to revoke McCann's license
for gross negligence in the care of Lopez and Donnell-Behringer, running
an uncertified surgery center, failing to maintain adequate records and
violating drug laws by improperly storing dangerous drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the board failed to prove its case but restricted
McCann's license, barring him from using anesthesia and thus from doing
surgery. (A Los Angeles County court judge also has prohibited McCann
from doing surgery, the prosecutor said.) McCann is now a general
practitioner in Norwalk.</TE>
<TE>   McCann denied the allegations the board made against him, but he would
not provide a copy of his written defense, which is not part of the
public record. McCann's attorney, Robert Forgnone, would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a different administrative judge in Los Angeles--after 24
days of hearings--substantiated the most serious charges that the medical
board brought against McCann. But despite the evidence, the judge decided
that McCann should receive a seven-year probation, with his license
restricted as before.</TE>
<TE>   "The proven allegations would certainly warrant license revocation in
most cases," Administrative Law Judge H. Stuart Waxman wrote. "However,
this is not 'most' cases."</TE>
<TE>   In McCann's favor, the judge wrote, were the physician's years of
helping patients, "many of whom are indigent, non-English speaking, and
in great need of assistance." The judge also paid deference to McCann's
military service. Also, he described McCann's 37-year medical career as
"unsullied," lacking any previous investigations by the medical board.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, the medical board rejected the judge's ruling. It will
exercise a seldom-used prerogative to have a committee of board officials
review the evidence this month. The deadline for board action is Jan. 24.</TE>
<TE>   The board's pursuit of McCann has been sluggish even by its usual
deliberative pace, critics say. It takes an average of 2.3 years for the
board to act against a physician's license, and more than three years
have gone by since the board opened its inquiry. The apparent delay
troubles consumer advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a medical board incapable of taking action against a
possibly dangerous doctor for years, for whatever reason, . . . that
frightens me," said Julianne D'Angelo Fellmeth, an attorney with the
Public Interest Law Center, part of the University of San Diego. "We're
not talking about gardening here."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the board would not comment on the pending McCann case
beyond noting that it is "complicated."</TE>
<TE>Physicians Group Opposes Prosecution</TE>
<TE>   Testimony began Friday in McCann's criminal trial in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of a felony, he faces a maximum of three years in prison
and restitution to Lopez and Donnell-Behringer. The judge has discretion
to downgrade the conviction to a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   The November 1999 indictment charges that McCann violated the terms of
his medical license by giving more anesthesia to Lopez and
Donnell-Behringer than his clinic was authorized to administer.</TE>
<TE>   McCann is being represented by a public defender, Randall Rich. He
argues McCann did not use excess anesthesia on the women. Even if he did,
Rich said, that would be a misdemeanor violation of health and safety
codes, not a felony violation of the medical license law, as the
prosecution argues.</TE>
<TE>   Rich also said the postoperative complications suffered by the women
have nothing to do with the anesthesia.</TE>
<TE>   The California Medical Assn. agrees with the defense. It argues that a
physician with a valid license cannot be prosecuted under the law in
question, which prohibits practicing medicine without a license.</TE>
<TE>   The physicians group says it is not passing judgment on McCann's
practices. But in a letter to the prosecutor decrying "the
criminalization of medical practice," an association lawyer says
"physicians must not be prosecuted for good-faith exercise of the
physician's medical judgment."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Anna Lopez, scoffed at those
arguments. To her, the case has exposed a world of rogue doctors
operating in marginal clinics and flouting the law to take advantage of
patients.</TE>
<TE>   "What astounds me is that the public is so uninformed," she said. "I
don't think people know whether to ask if a clinic is licensed."</TE>
<TE>   Idalia Lopez has had her eyes opened too, and she doesn't like what
she sees of the system for disciplining physicians. Afflicted by chronic
pain, covered with scars, buried in debt and unable to work at the
classroom job she loved, she has practically given up hope of being
compensated for her suffering.</TE>
<TE>   She'd just like to see McCann put out of business, she said, for
betraying her trust.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept telling me that I didn't need to go to the hospital, that he
was taking care of me, that I was fine," Lopez recalled of the days after
her liposuction. "That's what makes me upset now more than anything. He
could have prevented me from having all this trouble."</TE>

<HD>Panel to Decide on 2nd Term for Parks</HD>
<DH>Police: A civilian commission appointed by Hahn will consider
whether the chief should get another five years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks already indicating
that he wants a second five-year term, city officials are preparing to
activate a little-used process designed to evaluate whether the chief
should stay or go.</LD>
<LD>   The months-long reappointment procedure will draw players from several
branches of municipal government, and will involve scrutiny of the
department and its leader. Police commissioners and their staff have the
job of evaluating Parks' performance. Members of the City Council have
the authority to review and reject the commission's judgment.</LD>
<LD>   But a person who has no formal role in the process is the one who has
commented on it most extensively: Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<TE>   "As I told the chief before, I'm looking for real progress on
implementing the [federal court] consent decree, making the city safer,
improving community policing, improving morale and recruitment," Hahn
told reporters in late December. "What I'm looking for is what his plan
is for the next five years."</TE>
<TE>   Parks told a group of supporters last month that he wants to keep his
job. He held a news conference last week to review his own performance.
He is expected to announce his bid for another term in February. Hahn has
said he will make his view on the chief public early this year.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Hahn acknowledged that the City Charter
does not give him a formal voice in the process. Still, he said, the
decision about who should lead the Police Department is so significant
that he has an obligation to express his opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think at some point the public does look to the mayor as the chief
executive officer of the city government, [who] obviously would have a
position on something as important as the chief of police," Hahn said.
"But the right time for that is when the process is underway."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's lack of a direct role highlights a long-standing tension in Los
Angeles city government, which is run by a mayor but which also includes
a number of commissions charged with overseeing various departments.
Those commission members are appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the
council, but once in place do not always heed the wishes of those who put
them there.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Caruso, president of the Police Commission, said Hahn has every
right to weigh in on the matter, but stressed that the mayor's opinion
will not be the final word.</TE>
<TE>Independent of Mayor Hahn</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have to take it into account, but I don't think this
commission is prepared to be told what to do," Caruso said. "We need to
exercise our authority independently and do what's best for the city, and
that's going to be the standard."</TE>
<TE>   The chief's reappointment is unique in Los Angeles government in part
because no other city department is run by a manager with a term of
office. All others serve at the pleasure of the mayor. The police chief,
by charter, may serve a maximum of two five-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   Under that charter, Parks must announce by mid-February if he wants
another term. At that point, the five-member, civilian Police Commission
has three months to respond to his request. The commission is expected to
solicit community input and set up a panel to examine how the LAPD has
done under Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with those views, the commission then votes up or down on Parks'
future.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council can overturn the police panel by a two-thirds vote,
meaning that it would take 10 of the council's 15 members to overrule the
commission. But because of conflicting passages in the charter, it is
unclear whether the matter would end there or if the decision would
bounce back to the commission for additional action. The city attorney's
office is studying the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn does not have any formal role in the process unless the Police
Commission fails to act on Parks' request. In that case, he would have
until mid-June to make a decision about whether to keep the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Gunn, executive director of the commission, said he does not
expect that to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not his decision to make," Gunn said. "I'm surprised that the
mayor's office keeps saying that. We certainly want to get over this
rubber-stamp issue. It is the commission that makes the decision."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said that although he expects the
mayor's preference to be an important factor for the commission, Hahn
supports the panel making an independent decision.</TE>
<TE>   This is only the second exercise of the city's reappointment process,
which grew out of the 1991 Christopher Commission recommendations to
reform the LAPD. Prior to that, the city's police chief had no term of
office and could serve indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, then-Chief Willie Williams asked for a second term and was
rejected by the Police Commission. Williams' supporters accused
commissioners of doing then-Mayor Richard Riordan's bidding, though
Riordan himself said little about the reappointment. In fact, Riordan was
criticized in some quarters for not taking a more public role in the
debate over Williams, which culminated in the chief's ouster just weeks
before Riordan was reelected.</TE>
<TE>   As with that reappointment campaign, the current one is complicated by
politics. Hahn was elected with strong support from African Americans,
some of whom are highly supportive of Parks, who is black. But Hahn also
was helped by the endorsement of the city's police union, which has
accused the chief of being heavy-handed with discipline and fostering bad
morale within the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "The difficulty of all this is knowing when the mayor should weigh
in," said Cal State Fullerton professor Rafael Sonenshein, an expert on
the City Charter and the LAPD. "The timing of everything is crucial. The
decision could easily look like it's a purely political decision."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who has been careful to remain publicly neutral on the matter,
has said that political considerations will not influence his decision.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was the only candidate during last year's mayoral election
who did not say that the fallout from the Rampart corruption scandal and
sagging department morale made him inclined to replace Parks.</TE>
<TE>   But since taking office, Hahn has pushed for several policies that
Parks opposes, such as a flexible work schedule for police officers and a
civilian panel to review disciplinary violations.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn could defuse some of the political tension surrounding Parks'
reappointment by not getting ahead of the commission, Sonenshein said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real perilous decision, and it's best to make it on the
merits, and the only vehicle available is the Police Commission," he
said. "In an ideal world, the mayor would not express his opinion unless
the Police Commission has undertaken a great part of the process."</TE>
<TE>'Appropriate' for Mayor to Speak Out</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, argue that as the elected official who selects the
police commissioners, Hahn has a responsibility to voice his opinion
about the chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very appropriate that he speaks out about it," said
George Kieffer, a Hahn advisor who headed one of the panels that helped
rewrite the City Charter. "Since he appoints the commission, the public
will hold him accountable for the choice."</TE>
<TE>   If the commission elects not to reappoint Parks, Hahn's role becomes
much clearer in the next step of the process. In that case, the
commission would select three candidates for the chief's job and send
those names to the mayor. Hahn then would have the final say about who
takes over the helm of the LAPD.</TE>

<HD>A Home Tailor-Made for Bilbo Baggins</HD>
<DH>Architecture: One of the few Storybook style creations, it is full
of Hobbit-like whimsy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a sliver of a street near Culver City's main commercial strip
sits a tiny patch of Middle-earth where Bilbo Baggins would feel right at
home.</LD>
<LD>   Fountains gurgle languidly into ponds teeming with goldfish. Tree
trunks flank hand-carved doors. The shingles of domed roofs cascade down
walls chunky with bricks and mortar.</LD>
<LD>   In the tidy files of the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission, the
three structures that make up this urban fairyland are matter-of-factly
labeled the Lawrence and Martha Joseph Residence and Apartments,
Historic-Cultural Monument No. 624.</LD>
<TE>   But for decades, neighborhood youngsters have known them as the Hobbit
Houses.</TE>
<TE>   It is thus serendipitous that, half a block to the south, the Mann
Theatre on Washington Boulevard should now be showing "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," the sweeping epic of elves, wizards
and, of course, hobbits.</TE>
<TE>   These whimsical cottages, assembled lovingly from 1946 to 1970 by
Lawrence Joseph, a onetime artist for Walt Disney Co., are among the few
remaining buildings in Los Angeles in the Fantasy Revival style.</TE>
<TE>   Also known as Storybook style, the architecture calls to mind Snow
White, dwarfs and cackling witches stirring steaming pots of nasty
potions. The brick-red spider web designs built into doors and windows
enhance the Disneyesque aura, as do the myriad cats that slink across the
brick paving and doze in sunny patches on the roofs.</TE>
<TE>   "The houses are truly spectacular and unique," said Trudi Sandmeier, a
preservation advocate with the Los Angeles Conservancy, a group that
works to save the city's architectural and cultural heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like a folk art environment along the lines of the Watts
Towers," she added. "Someone's personal inspiration and creativity
created this little gem."</TE>
<TE>   The cottages also serve as a tangible link between Martha Joseph and
her late husband. "He built it. I watched him build it," she said. "It
has quite a meaning for me."</TE>
<TE>   If the exterior brick, timber and stucco evoke Hansel and Gretel, the
interiors would better suit Horatio Hornblower. Joseph, an expert
carpenter and sailor, used to describe his creations as "Scottish
seacoast" until he visited Scotland and didn't see anything much like
them there.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the built-in furnishings and carved beams--all finished
in a garnet hue--would warm a sea captain's heart. The kitchens resemble
galleys: long and narrow, with storage in every nautical nook and cranny.
Vertical-grain boat planking radiates out in eccentric circles on the
floors. Hand-gouged boards front the cupboards and chests. Red-tartan
wallpaper adorns many of the walls and ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   The main house and most of the apartments in the other two cottages
have built-in, fold-down desks. At each sits a three-legged chair. The
unsuspecting might try to perch on it as they would on a regular seat,
until told that the stools were used by those attending cockfights in
Spain and are intended to be sat upon backward, so that the elbows can
rest on the "back" of the chair.</TE>
<TE>   There are no doorknobs. Rather, doors open with boat latches and
levers, all fashioned by Joseph. Jauntily knotted ropes serve as pulls on
many of the drawers.</TE>
<TE>Naturally, Star Lore</TE>
<TE>   Like many a Los Angeles home, the Joseph property comes with a ration
of Hollywood lore.</TE>
<TE>   The late dancer and actress Gwen Verdon was the Josephs' first tenant.
Years ago, Nick Nolte squeezed into one of the bachelor pads in the rear
building, and Paula Prentiss and Richard Benjamin shared the upstairs
one-bedroom in front.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963--and it's a long story--authorities searching one of the seven
apartments found much of the $240,000 in ransom money paid by Frank
Sinatra after his son Frank Jr. was abducted. The Josephs had nothing to
do with the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings inhabit an otherwise undistinguished one-block stretch
of Dunn Drive, just south of Venice Boulevard in Palms, where many other
parcels have been paved over for parking.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street two residences survived the wrecker's ball, but the
rest of that side of the block consists of an open-air parking lot and an
ungainly, multilevel parking structure serving the theaters and nearby
medical buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and nurses in hospital garb crisscross the street, hurrying
between offices and nearby clinics. Few give the Hobbit Houses a second
glance.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame because, tucked behind trees, ferns, birds of paradise,
pools and dainty fences made of sticks, they would find a wondrous
hideaway.</TE>
<TE>   The property did catch the attention of Arrol Gellner and Douglas
Keister, who pictured it in their sleek new book "Storybook Style." They
describe the genre exemplified by the Joseph buildings as "the most
delightful home style of the 20th century," even though its heyday--1920s
and 1930s--was brief.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Storybook style houses are rarities, vastly outnumbered by the
California bungalow. Another prime example is the 1920s-vintage Spadena
House, also known as the Witch's House, which was moved to Beverly Hills
from Culver City. Designed by a studio art director, that house was famed
for its "theatrically exaggerated look," the authors note.</TE>
<TE>   To architectural historian Jeffrey Samudio, it was no accident that a
bevy of such "folkloric environments" sprang up in Southern California.
Many of those built just before, during and after World War II coincided
with the flourishing of the entertainment industry and the burgeoning of
the middle class.</TE>
<TE>   Union wages afforded whimsically minded residents unprecedented
leisure time in a benign climate, Samudio said, giving rise to such
hand-crafted monuments as Simon Rodia's Watts Towers, Grandma Prisby's
Bottle Village in Simi Valley and Lawrence Joseph's Hobbit Houses.</TE>
<TE>   As he was building, Joseph worked on secret military projects at the
Lockheed Skunk Works facility, then in Burbank. He died in 1991 and was
still tinkering with his cottages until near the end.</TE>
<TE>   His childless widow, Martha, worked for many years as a secretary for
movie studios, including Universal and MGM, just down the road from their
property. During her career, she was secretary to actor Rock Hudson and
director Alfred Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   Once a lithe dancer, she now uses a walker to get around. She is
constantly attended to by friends and longtime tenants, many of whom
treat her like a surrogate mother.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin O'Neill, who grew up in Culver City and has lived in one of the
Joseph apartments for 28 years, considers himself the property's
caretaker. A carpenter, he apprenticed informally with Lawrence Joseph,
whom he still refers to as "Papa."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Martha Joseph said she used to fret about what would
become of the property.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that three minutes after I'm gone, this will be a parking
lot," she would say.</TE>
<TE>Pursuing Long-Term Protection</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, with the help of a friend, Roberta Goodwin, she secured
historic-cultural monument status for the property from the city of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They are planning to pursue longer-term protection either by invoking
the Mills Act, a state law that provides property tax reductions for
historic properties for a 10-year period, or by donating an easement to
the Los Angeles Conservancy. To qualify for that, the property would have
to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Frodo Baggins enjoyed the fellowship of a loyal band as he set
out on his perilous journey to destroy the ring, so too has Martha Joseph
found supporters. She plans to name O'Neill and another tenant, along
with Goodwin, as the property's trustees.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm depending on them," Joseph said. "I want the place preserved."</TE>

<HD>S.F. Mauling Case Readied for L.A. Court</HD>
<DH>Violence: Dogs' owners are asking for separate trials. Couple's
ties to inmate are also at issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>A gruesome criminal case that outraged this pet-friendly city and
inspired tougher restrictions on the owners of dangerous dogs is expected
to go to trial in Los Angeles this month.</LD>
<LD>   Before jury selection begins, however, lawyers for Marjorie Knoller
and Robert Noel--whose two Presa Canario fighting dogs killed a neighbor
in an apartment building hallway--will appear in Superior Court here
today. At issue are legal points that only fuel the bizarre nature of the
upcoming trial, expected to last several months.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the couple, who are themselves lawyers, are asking for
separate trials, saying the pair could be found guilty by association in
the mauling death last winter of athlete Diane Whipple--an assault so
grisly that police at the scene needed counseling.</LD>
<TE>   If the move is successful, officials say, the case could be delayed or
could proceed under a scenario in which the defendants are tried in the
same courtroom but before two different juries.</TE>
<TE>   Also at issue is how much jurors should be told about the couple's
peculiar relationship with a Pelican Bay prison inmate and the Aryan
Brotherhood prison ring that prosecutors say organized the breeding of
attack dogs like the two that attacked Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the judge's exclusion of such crucial facts could
jeopardize the case.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was moved to Los Angeles after a torrent of publicity that
included reports of an Aryan Brotherhood death threat against one
prosecutor. San Francisco Superior Court Judge James Warren has ordered
attorneys not to speak publicly on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such distractions, a lawyer familiar with the case says the
prosecution's job is clear-cut.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to prove the couple knew those dogs were dangerous and that
they showed disregard for human life by keeping them in the manner they
were kept," said Michael Cardoza, a former prosecutor who has filed a
wrongful-death suit against the couple on behalf of Whipple's partner,
Sharon Smith, and the victim's mother.</TE>
<TE>   The attack occurred Jan. 26, 2001, when Whipple, a petite 33-year-old
college lacrosse coach, was carrying groceries into her sixth-floor
Pacific Heights apartment. At the same time, Knoller emerged from her own
unit with the dogs, Bane and Hera.</TE>
<TE>   Both dogs suddenly bounded toward Whipple, who stood 5-foot-3 and
weighed 110 pounds. Bane, weighing 123 pounds, bit Whipple's throat.
Hera, weighing 112 pounds, tore at her clothing in an agonizingly lengthy
attack that left Whipple bleeding profusely from a neck wound,
authorities say.</TE>
<TE>Larger Dog Destroyed; Other Held as Evidence</TE>
<TE>   Each time Knoller tried to get between the larger dog and Whipple, the
animal attacked again, eventually dragging Whipple 20 to 50 feet down the
hallway. That dog has been destroyed. Hera remains with animal control
officials as possible evidence at the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Indicted by a grand jury, Knoller faces a second-degree murder charge
and could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. Both Knoller and Noel also
have been charged with involuntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Furor over the attack led state legislators to toughen a law on the
keeping of dangerous dogs. The new law, which took effect Jan. 1, makes
it a felony to keep a dog that hurts someone seriously, not just fatally.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a city absolutely enthralled with dogs, and this case goes
against everything dog-loving San Franciscans believe--that dogs can turn
killer and that their owners can go to trial," Cardoza said. "You also
have two defendants with a proclivity to speak their own minds. The
things they have said publicly have only raised more interest in this
case. Their egos transcended their common sense."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, Knoller and Noel--lawyers who built a practice
defending the rights of state prison inmates--have challenged the
investigation and once sent prosecutors an 18-page letter outlining their
version of events. Noel also suggested that Whipple attracted the dogs by
wearing perfume or taking steroids.</TE>
<TE>   The pair also want to exclude details about their relationship with
prison inmate Paul "Cornfed" Schneider. Officials say Schneider and
another inmate ran a scheme to orchestrate the breeding of killer attack
dogs from their prison by persuading a rural Northern California woman to
care for and train the animals.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's ties to Schneider are even more personal: Knoller and
Noel had adopted Schneider as their son before the attack.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, prosecutors say such details show "the nature and
depth of the conspiracy between the parties to raise aggressive and
vicious dogs, and the close, more-than-professional relationship that
existed" between the couple and Schneider--who is serving a life sentence
without possibility of parole for attempted murder and aggravated assault
while in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say knowledge of the relationship is crucial if Schneider
testifies, showing he has reason to lie on behalf of the two lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   In a responding court brief, Knoller's attorney, Nedra Ruiz, says the
prosecution is trying to "taint the defendants with the completely
unsubstantiated allegation of involvement in [a] . . . conspiracy with
prisoners."</TE>
<TE>Defense Seeks to Bar Neighbors' Testimony</TE>
<TE>   The couple's lawyers also want to exclude testimony from at least 10
neighbors who had encounters with the two dogs--along with the fact that
Bane was known by neighborhood residents as "Beast," "Killer Dog" and
"Dog of Death"--saying that it would prejudice the case.</TE>
<TE>   The couple have also pointed a finger at each other for actions that
they say could jeopardize their right to a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller's "actions on that terrible day will be the focus and the
centerpiece of this litigation," according to papers filed by Noel's
court-appointed attorney, Bruce Hotchkiss. "Mr. Noel's guilt is
predicated solely on the theory that he should not have brought the dogs
into the city at all, and that he should not have entrusted them to Mrs.
Knoller to care for by herself."</TE>
<TE>   Court papers also include a letter Noel sent to Schneider before the
attack, which prosecutors in court papers characterize as "bragging about
scaring a woman . . . almost to death."</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, which defense lawyers want stricken as potential
evidence, Noel writes of an encounter before the fatal attack in which a
terrified Whipple waits for an elevator: "As soon as the door opens at 6,
one of our newer female neighbors, a timorous little mousy blond . . . is
met by the dynamic duo exiting and all most [sic] has a coronary--the
mutts show only passing interest as she gets in and goes down."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the letter shows that Noel's "desire to please Mr.
Schneider by raising vicious and aggressive dogs is reflected in his
gleeful and sarcastic account of the encounter with Diane Whipple."</TE>
<TE>   Tried together or separately, the couple's fate will rest on the
impression they make with the jury, attorney Cardoza predicts.</TE>
<TE>   "Juries sense what people are like," he said. "They listen and watch.
In the end, they'll have a true picture of the mind-set of these two
defendants."</TE>

<HD>For $5,000, You Too Can Join the Roundtable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The letter was sent to my home, inviting me to become a member of a
select, high-powered fraternity with access to the world's most powerful
policymakers.</LD>
<LD>   "Dear Mr. Lopez:</LD>
<LD>   "It is through gathering the best and brightest of our Party that we
are able to develop sound Republican strategies that tackle the problems
of today and debate the issues of tomorrow."</LD>
<TE>   I almost ran out and had all my shirts monogrammed. Never before had I
received a personal letter from the Republican Presidential Roundtable.
My gold-sealed invitation is positively suitable for framing.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican leadership of the United States Senate is honored to
nominate Mr. Steven Lopez to serve as a representative from California,"
it said.</TE>
<TE>   As a perk, I'd been invited to break bread with President Bush and
attend a tribute party for former President Reagan. They wanted me to be
"among the top echelon of leaders who are shaping our Party's future."</TE>
<TE>   Geez, I might get to meet Enron's Ken Lay. Maybe, if I act now,
they'll throw in an Andersen paper shredder so I can dispose of financial
documents that might prove embarrassing down the road.</TE>
<TE>   But before I put on my party hat, one small problem crossed my mind.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   True enough, I had spent some time traveling with Bush during the
1999-2000 presidential campaign. I'd hung around with Republican Sen.
John McCain, too, and thought he was the most honorable man on the trail.</TE>
<TE>   But I've been a dues-paying union man most of my career, have railed
for years against corporate welfare and never lobbied a cabinet official
for a tax break.</TE>
<TE>   So the obvious question is, why do the captains of industry feel
compelled to set a place for me at the Republican Roundtable?</TE>
<TE>   I thought maybe they'd seen the columns in which I roughed up Gov.
Gray Davis, a Democrat. But that couldn't be it. I haven't exactly been
leading cheers for his probable Republican opponent, Dick Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Then it hit me. It's my name.</TE>
<TE>   We all know the Bush family has tried its best to reach out to
Latinos, dating back to when Abuelo (Grandpa) Bush proudly pointed out
"the little brown ones" among his grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush recently flew to California to rub shoulders with
Latino businessmen in Ontario. Maybe, while he was here, some of his
people went through phone books.</TE>
<TE>   Before they review my application, though, I do have something else to
confess.</TE>
<TE>   Not only am I not a Republican, I'm not brown.</TE>
<TE>   (Does anyone in the upper ranks of this party do any homework at all?)</TE>
<TE>   My father's family is from Spain, I've been called olive-skinned, y yo
hablo un poquito. But I'm wondering if the Roundtable guessed someone
else was coming to dinner.</TE>
<TE>   I'm reminded of the time I won the Filipino-American Society
scholarship in high school, then saw nothing but puzzled looks on Fil-Am
officers when I arrived at the banquet to collect the $200 cash. There
was a Filipino kid named Lopez in my class, and the scholarship was
intended for him.</TE>
<TE>   Another possible explanation for my nomination to the Roundtable is
that Republicans, like Democrats, are such insatiable beggars, they'll
randomly hit up anyone for money, whether it's a shot in the dark or not.</TE>
<TE>   I had to read all the way to the fourth page of my Roundtable
invitation to find out membership will cost me $5,000. The money, I'm
told, will be spent on Republican Senate candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Or, if I scammed the five grand out of my company, there would be
fewer strings attached, and the contribution could go toward any number
of Republican causes.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lot of money, sure, but let's face it: Public policy is for
sale to the highest bidder, so if you want to be a player, you've got to
ante up.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to their connections, Enron operatives lobbied for the kind of
deregulation that made the company's value soar, and top execs were
secretly advising the Bush administration on energy policy. Then, as the
company was tanking, Enron poobahs were in touch with Bush cabinet
officials who kept their mouths shut, even as Enron's top brass dashed
away with millions while unsuspecting employees saw their life savings go
up in smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Membership has its advantages. And do you think Enron would have
gotten within six states of D.C. if Ken Lay and his pals hadn't kicked
$1.7 million to Republican causes in the 1999-2000 campaign?</TE>
<TE>   Then you've got Andersen, which contributed $1 million to the
Republican cause in the same campaign cycle. That investment can't hurt,
now that the firm has been dragged into a criminal investigation after
admitting it shredded Enron financial documents.</TE>
<TE>   I always thought, by the way, that you were supposed to keep financial
records for years. But Andersen, one of the most successful auditing
outfits in all the land, has set an example I think we should all follow:
Live fast and loose, cover your trail and maintain lots of friends in
high places.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I want in. I hereby accept my nomination to the Republican
Presidential Roundtable.</TE>
<TE>   Yo tengo el dinero, amigos. Yo quiero ser Republicano.</TE>

<LD>A private deep-water diving firm hired by the families of four men
believed to have been killed in a boating accident on Castaic Lake
discovered the sunken wreckage of the luxury powerboat early Sunday
evening with the use of a submersible camera, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The boat was 246 feet below the surface, too deep for county divers.
Three employees and a customer of an Agua Dulce boat-building company
were testing a new boat at high speed Friday when it capsized. The body
of Ken Lane, 41, of La Crescenta was found.</LD>
<LD>   The families had hired a diving company from Ventura, but the firm
turned down the job Sunday morning because it lacked the proper equipment
to proceed, said Sheriff's Deputy Richard Pena.</LD>
<TE>   A San Diego firm was then called in and began searching. The bodies of
the three missing men were not found, but the firm and the Sheriff's
Department will attempt to raise the vessel today.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the accident can call (323) 890-5500.</TE>

<HD>A Toe-Tapping Farewell</HD>
<DH>Community: The 'official band' of Manhattan Beach stages a concert
in memory of founding member and vocalist Jules Radinsky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hyperion Outfall Serenaders, Manhattan Beach's beloved
"official band" for more than a quarter of a century, gathered late
Sunday afternoon at a local watering hole to say goodbye to one of their
founding members, vocalist Jules Radinsky. And they did it with a
pack-the-house, rollicking memorial concert, long on laughter and short
on tears.</LD>
<LD>   A crowd made up mostly of silver-haired folks filled all the seats at
Suzy's--a bar and grill in a Hermosa Beach strip mall anchored by a Pic
'N' Save--and overflowed onto the sidewalk outside. Through the open
doors, the strains of "California, Here I Come," "Ja Da" and "The Beer
Barrel Polka," punctuated by cheers and clapping from the audience,
washed over the parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   "Jules would have loved it," bandleader Bob White of Manhattan Beach
said.</LD>
<TE>   The celebration was planned to commemorate Radinsky's 91st birthday
this month. But the purpose changed with Radinsky's death from an
apparent heart attack Dec. 30 on Catalina Island, where the band has gone
annually for a decade to play on New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Radinsky, a former director of the Seattle Pops and Seattle Summer
Symphony, had lived in the South Bay for nearly 40 years and was one of
the original members of the Dixieland-style band, which formed in 1969
and playfully took its name from the sewage treatment facility on the
beach just north of town. Radinsky and his fellow band members, most of
whom are in their 60s or 70s, soon became a fixture in the region,
playing at 10K runs, community parades and pancake breakfasts,
ribbon-cuttings, anniversary celebrations, weddings and, occasionally,
funerals.</TE>
<TE>   The band, which describes its repertoire as "happy, toe-tapping
stuff," developed a reputation for its sense of sometimes-irreverent fun,
and nobody enjoyed the gigs more than Radinsky, friends and fellow
musicians said.</TE>
<TE>   Which may have accounted for the decidedly upbeat tone of Sunday's
concert.</TE>
<TE>   "He was almost 91, he went quickly, and he was on his way to a gig,
which he loved," Billie Green, wife of the band's banjo player, Jimmy
Green, said as she sipped wine and ate nachos at a table near the back of
the room.</TE>
<TE>   Ethel Pattison, wife of clarinetist Sid Pattison, concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems different not to see him up there," she said, as band
members, dressed in pale pink dress shirts, burgundy ties and khaki
slacks, took their places on the small stage, their familiar blue banner
hanging on a side wall.</TE>
<TE>   "But we can be grateful for having him with us for so long, and that
he had a great way to go," Pattison added.</TE>
<TE>   In the audience were Radinsky's three daughters, at least one
grandchild and Mary Lewis, his companion of more than 20 years.
Well-wishers hugged Lewis, greeted other family members and swapped
memories. Several former band members showed up and joined current ones
on stage.</TE>
<TE>   And, underlying the celebratory tone of the gathering, there were some
poignant moments. After a couple of warmup numbers, White welcomed the
crowd, and the band opened the set with a long rendition of "When You're
Smiling." It had been one of Radinsky's favorites, White explained, and
he had always provided the vocals.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, however, the band played the song as an instrumental.
Nobody even tried to fill in for Radinsky on that one.</TE>

<HD>Two Teens Are Killed in High-Speed Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Saugus High School athletes were killed early Sunday morning in
a high-speed crash. The driver had no license, the accident's
investigator said.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Smith and Sheldon Bell, both 17 and seniors, died about 1 a.m.
Sunday after Smith lost control of his Ford Mustang. The speeding car
left thick skid marks as it crossed a median, spun around and rammed a
backyard retaining wall of a Saugus house.</LD>
<LD>   Bell was declared dead at the scene by paramedics. Smith was
pronounced dead soon after at a hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Mark Slater said the Department of
Motor Vehicles had no record of Smith being issued a driver's license in
California. Friends who gathered Sunday at the site of the accident
disputed that, but none of them disputed that the football player liked
speed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to race sometime," Tim Plevack said Smith told him at
school Friday, the last time he saw his teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "He pushed everything," said Plevack, 16. "He pushed it to the max."</TE>
<TE>   Slater said he had not yet determined how fast Smith was driving, but
he said the white Mustang was traveling well above Bouquet Canyon Road's
posted limit of 50 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "The skid marks out there tell the story," Slater said.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, Smith and Bell were among about 200 teenagers dancing
at a Valencia arcade. The two boys, who had become close after Bell moved
to the area last summer from the Antelope Valley, were good for laughs.
Bell, who was 6-foot-5 and weighed more than 200 pounds, was a hugger.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheldon's hugs were like the best things ever. He was like a big
teddy bear," said Kevin O'Donnell, 16, who played football with Bell. "He
gave me a hug on Friday. He came up behind me and said, 'Guess who?' "</TE>
<TE>   Bell was nearing the end of basketball season.</TE>
<TE>   "He was playing extremely well and had a great personality," Coach
Jeff Hallman said. "He was a big member of our basketball family and will
be sorely missed."</TE>
<TE>   Word of Smith and Bell's deaths spread quickly Sunday and seemed to
sober a crowd of teenagers fond of putting their cars through their
paces. A stream of stunned friends visited the place where the two
crashed.</TE>
<TE>   The football team met at the school Sunday and watched game footage of
Smith and Bell. A candlelight service on campus was planned for Sunday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha Lopez, a 17-year-old senior, said she sat next to Smith in
economics class, and he joked he didn't need to study because his mother
was an accountant.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said that when Smith rode in her car, he was impressed that she
drove so fast.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never do that again," she said Sunday. "Ever."</TE>

<HD>Cold-Case Unit Gives Hope to Daughter of Homicide Victim</HD>
<DH>Crime: New LAPD team is looking into 1996 Van Nuys slaying and
other unsolved murders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago, the small, frail body of 47-year-old Armenak
Gyulbudagyan was found riddled with bullets in the trunk of his car.</LD>
<LD>   No one was arrested for the killing and the investigation grew cold,
relegated to the back burner by overworked detectives.</LD>
<LD>   But the crime was always on the mind of Kristine Langhenry, the
victim's only daughter. She wrote letters to the Los Angeles Police
Department, asking for help. Nothing came of them, she said.</LD>
<TE>   This although a suspect in the case was her mother, Tamara Oganesyan,
who had recently divorced the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Langhenry, 27, who lives in Maryland, wrote to LAPD Capt.
Jim Tatreau. Her timing was good. In late November, the LAPD's
Robbery-Homicide Division, commanded by Tatreau, unveiled a new unit
dealing with cold cases--unsolved homicides that had dropped in priority.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like a good case," Tatreau said. "Van Nuys Division just
didn't have the time and couldn't devote the necessary resources. So we
picked it up."</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau said there is no set way to determine a case has gone cold.</TE>
<TE>   "There's different stages of cold," he said. "If it's sitting on
somebody's list of current cases, I would say it's not too cold. But if
it has fallen off the radar screen then it probably is.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when the victim's family has to demand some level of service,
and that is what [Langhenry] did very well," Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not unusual for a homicide to go unsolved. Of the 544 homicides
in 2000 in Los Angeles, less than half were cleared, according to LAPD
statistics. And a great deal of work was done on the Gyulbudagyan case
before it cooled off.</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, 1996, LAPD officers noticed an illegally parked car in an
alley off the 5700 block of Woodman Avenue in Van Nuys. They found
Gyulbudagyan's 5-foot-1, 120-pound body in the trunk with several bullet
wounds in his torso.</TE>
<TE>   Fingerprints were left on the steering wheel and doors and in the
trunk, Langhenry said. There were cigarettes in the car, but Gyulbudagyan
did not smoke. Hair and fiber evidence was collected, Langhenry said.
She's hoping with crime-fighting technology having improved since her
father's death, new clues will lead to an arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys detectives had filled seven notebooks with notes on the
slaying of Gyulbudagyan.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't like Van Nuys [detectives] shined it on, because they had a
lot of work on it," said Det. Rick Jackson, one of eight officers now
assigned to the case. "I already have some thoughts about it."</TE>
<TE>   Langhenry is happy that the case is being reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "When Tatreau personally called me back and said his unit would take
the case, I was star-struck," said Langhenry, a budget analyst for the
federal government in Washington. "So I'm hoping, though I've hoped
before."</TE>
<TE>   Langhenry said she is not afraid of what detectives may discover.</TE>
<TE>   "I've thought of my mom . . . being involved, but my main objective is
to get it solved," said Langhenry, who maintains a close relationship
with her mother. "Of course, it would upset me, but I've had 5 1/2 years
to think of every possibility. Plus, my mom is a good lady."</TE>
<TE>   Oganesyan, 49, who was married to Gyulbudagyan for 20 years, said she
is also pleased Robbery-Homicide has the case, because she is eager to
have her name cleared. The couple's divorce was finalized one month
before the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great idea they are going to investigate it again,"
said Oganesyan, who owns a jewelry store and art gallery in Carmel. "This
crime destroyed our family, and we're having a hard time coping with it.
You wake up one morning and your life is destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I was the biggest suspect, even though I was divorced at the
time, even though I've never even seen a gun."</TE>

<HD>Hertzberg to Pursue Peace in the Valley</HD>
<DH>Politics: Stepping down as speaker, the assemblyman vows to devote
time to seeking an alternative to secession. A borough system has
'potential,' he says.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearing the end of his term as Assembly speaker, Bob Hertzberg is
preparing to jump into the debate over the future of Los Angeles, and
said he wants to play a role in shaping discussion on whether the city
should be divided.</LD>
<LD>   The Sherman Oaks Democrat steps down as speaker Feb. 5. In an
interview last week, Hertzberg said he plans to devote more time and
effort to determining what is the best plan for government in Los
Angeles, where many residents feel disenfranchised.</LD>
<LD>   "I have said time and time again that I am not a secessionist,"
Hertzberg said. "I want to construct a vision for the future for
everybody that is positive. I don't know specifically what that is, but
I'm going home and I'm going to work on it."</LD>
<TE>   A longtime student of government, Hertzberg said one alternative to
secession that intrigues him is creation of a borough system similar to
New York City's.</TE>
<TE>   Under that approach, Los Angeles would remain one city with a central
city government for citywide issues, but would be divided into boroughs,
with each able to elect representatives to make local decisions on
planning and budget issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has potential to it, absolutely," Hertzberg said. "A
borough system gives to all the various regions that have their own
identity an ability to create a government that is more responsive to
their community."</TE>
<TE>   As the author of legislation that paved the way for a study of
secession, the first step toward cityhood, Hertzberg is seen by both
sides of the issue as an important voice in the upcoming debate.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of the most respected elected officials in the Valley,"
Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close said. "His views are critical in any
debate on Valley cityhood."</TE>
<TE>   Although he opposes breaking up the city, Hertzberg has turned down a
request by Mayor James K. Hahn to join the campaign against secession. He
said he has no plans to join the effort of Valley VOTE to win approval
for a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Both Hahn and Valley VOTE have made strong overtures to Hertzberg to
join their campaigns, but Hertzberg said he hopes to be an active voice
above the political fray for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg, who leaves office at the end of the year, also said he has
decided against a run for mayor of a new Valley city, assuming the issue
is put to voters.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will most likely take a private-sector job--perhaps in law
or investment banking--that would allow him to have dinner every night
with his wife and three children, ages 10, 12 and 14.</TE>
<TE>   While Hertzberg said he has no plans to become involved in either side
of a political campaign involving secession, the speaker has told Hahn
that he supports the mayor's efforts to demonstrate to voters how City
Hall is more responsive to their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Friend Richard Katz, a former assemblyman and member of Valley VOTE,
said he understands why Hertzberg does not want to be seen yet as taking
sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Why start that fight with people if you are not sure it's going to be
on the ballot?" Katz said. "I can understand why people are being
cautious."</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg, 47, was his usual bundle of energy during an interview in
the spacious speaker's office in Sacramento last week. At one point he
brought out a large chart he had made in 1996 detailing all of the state
statutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one of those crazy people who reads charters of other cities,"
Hertzberg said, confessing he has read every proposal ever made for the
Los Angeles City Charter since the city's inception.</TE>
<TE>   That knowledge and enthusiasm, he says, will be brought to bear on the
issue of how to make Los Angeles work.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been dealing with the energy crisis, and the budget crisis and
terrorism and the big issues in the state," he said. "I will put a lot
more time and attention to this after the speakership."</TE>
<TE>   The key, he said, is finding a form of government that responds to the
needs of residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The concerns of the people of San Pedro, the concerns of the people
of the Valley are real," he said.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Dedicates Church</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be wrong to call Sunday's special Mass at St. Paschal
Baylon Catholic Church a rededication ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony traveled from Los Angeles to bless the
newly renovated Thousand Oaks church, anointing with oil and incense the
walls, altar and baptismal font.</LD>
<LD>   And hundreds of parishioners, many of whom reached deep into their
wallets to help pay for the improvements, packed the 40-year-old
sanctuary as it was formally dedicated for worship.</LD>
<TE>   But in researching the history of St. Paschal's, church leaders
discovered that the current building had never been dedicated to begin
with.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony took care of that oversight Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   In a Mass that stretched for more than two hours, Mahony officially
launched a new chapter for the fast-growing church, which has undergone
an extensive face lift in recent years designed to break down barriers
between parishioners and clergy and make for a more effective ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an active Catholic community and it continues to grow,"
Mahony told the congregation moments after following a procession of
priests and altar boys into the church. "This [renovation] brings people
closer together and closer to where the Scriptures are preached."</TE>
<TE>   The $2-million modernization project included spiffing up the parish
hall and school. But the core of the remodeling centered on changing the
configuration of the church building, to bring the rites of worship in
line with Vatican reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "So often, the configuration of our worship space has been in the form
of a theater, so that people are out there being observers of what is
taking place," said Msgr. Joseph George, spiritual leader at St. Paschal.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since Vatican II, the emphasis has been to draw them more into
the celebration as participants," he said. "This is part of our master
plan to provide resources and facilities that can help people help the
parish in the work it has to do."</TE>
<TE>   The idea, George said, was to move worship off a pedestal and bring it
closer to the people.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders moved the altar 15 feet closer to parishioners and
placed traditional wooden pews and cushioned folding chairs on three
sides. The baptismal font was moved to the front of the church to remind
parishioners that they became members of the church through baptism.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the renovation cost--about $1.8 million--was pledged by
parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make our building reflect our faith," said Betty Reyes,
a parishioner since 1989 and the church's director of worship.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has been absolutely wonderful in coming together to make
this happen," she said. "And now we have a home where God and his people
can come together and worship."</TE>

<HD>Gun Law Proposed in Low-Crime Irvine</HD>
<DH>Business: The city, which ranks among the nation's safest, is
considering a virtual ban on new sales of firearms, raising ire of gun
lobby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI considers Irvine one of the nation's safest cities, a
master-planned community where nagging issues range from lawn maintenance
to the early morning howl of leaf blowers.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a new debate in town: gun control.</LD>
<LD>   Civic leaders have been presented with a proposal that would be among
the toughest gun laws in the state, making it nearly impossible for new
retailers to sell firearms. All in a city where gun violence is minimal.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed law, drafted by Councilman Chris Mears, would make it
illegal to sell firearms within 1,000 feet of churches, schools,
playgrounds or city-owned buildings. In Irvine, almost every commercial
center is within a short walking distance of one or more of those.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simply an effort to provide us with a slightly greater degree of
local control and confidence about gun sales," Mears said.</TE>
<TE>   And just in case there's a corner of the city where a gun dealer could
set up shop--something that won't be known until the proposal is
studied--the ordinance also would require the dealer to obtain a special
business permit, pass a background check conducted by police, carry
liability insurance and keep a log of all ammunition sales.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal already has raised the ire of anti-gun-control lobbies.</TE>
<TE>   "The ordinance is designed to harass and create bureaucracy and make
it impossible for gun dealers to do business in the city," said Chuck
Michel, an attorney for the Fullerton-based California Rifle and Pistol
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed law, which won't come before the City Council for at
least a month, takes a different tack from state gun laws, which require
a 10-day waiting period for firearm purchases. Such cooling-off periods
allow the state Department of Justice time to screen a gun buyer's
background and check for felony convictions. Felons are prohibited from
owning guns.</TE>
<TE>   According to a survey by Legal Community Against Violence, a San
Francisco-based organization that researches local gun measures, only
three cities in the state have adopted laws that mirror what Mears is
proposing: Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco. But each covers a
far-flung geography where guns can be sold in certain areas and each has
a higher crime rate than Irvine, which has been ranked among the nation's
10 safest cities of its size for the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of other cities have experimented with restricted firearms
sales--limiting calibers, types of weapons or high-powered bullets--but
very few have adopted laws that could result in an outright ban on the
sale of guns.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the small Northern California town of Lafayette came close,
imposing stiff restrictions on gun dealers, including a ban on gun stores
within 1,000 feet of a park, school or residential area. The city's sole
gun dealer sued Lafayette and lost. But he didn't challenge the
1,000-foot restriction, and city leaders said they haven't conducted
measurements to determine whether it would be illegal to sell guns in the
city's small retail core.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had any others wanting to come in and set up shop since
then," said Lafayette City Atty. Charles Williams.</TE>
<TE>Existing Retailers Would Be Exempted</TE>
<TE>   Irvine is not awash in gun retailers either. Big 5 Sporting Goods,
near city-run Alton Athletic Park, sells rifles and ammunition, and there
are two licensed antique gun dealers. All would be exempt from the
proposed law if it is adopted in its current state.</TE>
<TE>   Conforming to local gun laws is nothing new to Big 5, said company
spokesman Gabriel Friederitchsen. "There are already a number of cities
that have implemented various gun control ordinances, and we abide by
anything the local, state or federal authorities require," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Mears' colleagues are impressed by the proposed gun law.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rather puzzling ordinance," Councilman Greg Smith said. "It
feels good, but it doesn't serve much of a purpose. It's just a
statement."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the proposal falls in line with past efforts in Irvine to
adopt "feel-good" laws that are largely symbolic, such as a previous
council's decision to declare the city a "nuclear-free zone."</TE>
<TE>   Michel, the rifle association attorney, said he hopes to persuade
Mears to tackle gun control in other ways. "Irvine's program wouldn't
address the illegal purchase of guns directly," he said. "There are other
programs that don't require an ordinance and that deal with this problem
much more effectively, and the dealers are happy to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Michel points to a program that Anaheim implemented in August 2000
that requires gun dealers to notify authorities immediately after someone
has been denied authorization to purchase a firearm.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the Department of Justice notifies the dealer of its
findings first. But sometimes, local authorities aren't notified right
away--or at all.</TE>
<TE>   "What police in Anaheim did was go for a strategic alliance with the
gun dealers, so if a dealer gets a reject notice from the Department of
Justice, he calls the Anaheim Police Department right away," said Michel,
who worked with Anaheim in developing the program.</TE>
<TE>   "Then when the guy goes to the store to pick up his gun, police can
arrest him. So we get these people off the street rather than let them
slip off into the wind."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the program has resulted in about a dozen arrests, said
Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   "If we didn't have this program in place, we wouldn't have known about
those 10 to 15 people," he said. "They wouldn't get the gun, but there
also wouldn't be any follow-through."</TE>
<TE>   Some cities have tried to regulate adult businesses through similar
zoning laws, creating restrictions that prohibit them from operating
within 1,000 feet of "sensitive" areas. But they don't always hold up in
court.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley fought for several years to regulate adult businesses
through a zoning law. But last year, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand an
appeals court ruling that found the city had violated an adult club
owner's 1st Amendment rights by denying him a zoning permit.</TE>
<TE>   But proponents of gun control measures say dealing with firearms is a
different game altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities don't have to have gun dealers in their community," said
Andres Soto, a policy analyst for Pacific Center for Violence Prevention,
which tracks and promotes local gun control measures. "They have complete
local discretion over what they want and don't want within their city
limits."</TE>
<TE>   Soto credits local gun laws such as the one Irvine is considering for
a consistent decline in gun sales and gun-related deaths and injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1994, there were over 19,500 gun licensees in the state, and now
there are below 3,500," Soto said. "If you limit the number of conduits
in which firearms come into a community and you regulate those that
exist, you clean up the business. The result is less guns are sold, and
gun crime goes down."</TE>
<TE>   And using the 2nd Amendment as a legal argument to fight such laws
probably won't be accepted in court, said Andy Spafford, a senior staff
attorney for the Legal Community Against Violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The 2nd Amendment only applies to the regulation of a state militia,"
he said. "Since that isn't impinged upon by regulating the location of
gun dealers, you don't have a basis for raising the 2nd Amendment as an
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Mears, who said his proposed law was not motivated by a particular
incident, said he is not trying to put anyone out of business. But he
does want the city to pick up where state and federal gun laws leave off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we can do about the proliferation of gun violence in
society," he said. "And I think it's appropriate for us on a local level
to do what we can and say what kind of a community we want."</TE>

<HD>Raising Squab Nowadays Not for Pigeon-Hearted</HD>
<DH>Business: Culinary alternatives and recession have pecked away at
demand for the young birds as a delicacy. But breeder has found a niche.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's good to be the Squab King, but it isn't easy.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, hardly anyone knows that the "squab" part refers to
delicate young pigeons, plucked and processed before the exertion of
flying can toughen their butter-soft breast muscles.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll tell people at parties I'm the Squab King," says Gary Carpenter,
who tosses off the title with a grain of salt, "and they'll say, 'The
what, the what king?' I've even met some chefs at high-caliber
restaurants who don't have a clue."</LD>
<TE>   Sitting in the unheated office of his idyllic little spread near Ojai,
Carpenter piles on the kind of laments familiar to growers of everything
from cows to cabbage: The market is fickle. Nagging diseases can chew
away at your profit. If you're not careful, competition from inferior
goods can eventually nudge you off the nation's dinner plate and onto the
compost pile of obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of mousetraps sit on the floor and 11 pairs of knee-high
rubber boots--essential garb in the bird business--stand on a rack,
awaiting action. Nearby, you can hear the honeyed murmur of some 16,000
pigeons--a vast, otherworldly chorus of coos as sleep-inducing as a New
Age meditation tape.</TE>
<TE>   A lanky man with a sardonic wit, Carpenter has been living off the fat
of the squab for all of his 58 years. For three generations, his family
has bred the avian morsels, selling them to high-toned eateries back when
only the most benighted hayseed would wrinkle his brow and ask: "The
what? The what king?"</TE>
<TE>   Roasted squab on wilted watercress was the seventh of 11 sumptuous
courses the night the Titanic went down. Squab teased the palates of
moguls and movie stars; Carpenter's father and grandfather serviced such
elegant establishments as Ciro's and Romanoff's, where, Gary Carpenter
recalls, "even the garbage cans smelled wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   But times have changed. In 1965, the Cornish game hen--a hybrid
chicken introduced by poultry giant Tyson--started replacing the more
expensive and difficult-to-prepare squab even at the finer
establishments. "A terrible fraud," insists Carpenter, pointing out that
Cornish game hen is, after all, only chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the recession is doing no favors for breeders of a delicacy
that can hit the $30 range on menus of upscale restaurants. Even worse,
cheaper birds raised in Canada are clipping the wings of their American
counterparts, said Robert Shipley, president of Squab Producers of
California, a cooperative of about 75 members.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a robust market right now," said Shipley, whose Modesto
office sits at the center of the state's squab industry. "At high-end
places in San Francisco and New York, we've seen a real downturn in
demand."</TE>
<TE>   While the tiny pigeons still star at a number of well-known gourmet
restaurants, most of Carpenter's birds are trucked to wholesalers in Los
Angeles' Chinatown. Through them, he has managed to scratch a sizable
niche, selling to Asian restaurants throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "As the population has changed, we've benefited," said Carpenter, one
of the state's largest independent squab producers. Typically, California
producers have flocks only about 10% the size of his, according to
industry sources.</TE>
<TE>   Walking through rows of wood-and-chicken-wire coops, Carpenter checks
on his massive brood. Here, he scrutinizes a worker's notes on breeders'
productivity; there, he gently lifts a cooing, fist-sized ball of
feathers.</TE>
<TE>   "Monday," he says. "This one will be ready on Monday."</TE>
<TE>   These pigeons aren't the winged rats that carpet-bomb the cityscape,
or the flying heroes that once flapped their way through enemy gunfire
with urgent messages. A squab's job is just to be born, to sit, and to
accept food regurgitated from its parents' beaks. After 28 days, the
fledgling is ready for anything--especially, say, a bed of mixed greens
and a sun-dried blueberry vinaigrette.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years ago, one of Carpenter's birds achieved immortality--or the
closest a squab can get to it--with its leading role in what GQ magazine
deemed one of the world's top 10 meals.</TE>
<TE>   John Downey, chef and proprietor of Downey's restaurant in Santa
Barbara, still serves the dish--squab roasted with cloves of garlic,
thyme and braised mustard greens.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to achieve a perfect medium-rare for the breast and legs,"
Downey says. "If it's in the well-done range, you're talking about an
entirely different piece of food."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter didn't set out to be a third-generation squab man. A folk
singer by avocation, he had planned a career as a music agent. But a
diagnosis of diabetes in his last year of college convinced him that he'd
stay healthier with a physically active job in the family business.</TE>
<TE>   It was started in 1921 by his grandfather, physician Edwin Carpenter.
Fascinated by the science of genetics, he eventually quit medicine to
breed the perfect squab--hardy, broad-breasted and quick to multiply.
Edwin Carpenter failed in his quest, but a friend and rival, physician
G.M. Hubbell, succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Gary Carpenter says, the birds in his flock are the only ones
descended from Hubbell's marvelous hybrids, despite claims to the
contrary from other squab ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   Each week, he kills and plucks 1,000 delectable, month-old pigeons,
sending them from his shaded dell off the Casitas Pass to their destiny
at Chinese pleasure palaces and other fine eateries from San Francisco to
Hollywood..</TE>

<HD>Raising Squab Not for Pigeon-Hearted</HD>
<DH>Farming: Culinary trends, recession have pecked away at demand. But
a local breeder has found a niche.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's good to be the Squab King, but it isn't easy.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, hardly anyone knows that the "squab" part refers to
delicate young pigeons, plucked and processed before the exertion of
flying can toughen their butter-soft breast muscles.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll tell people at parties I'm the Squab King," says Gary Carpenter,
who tosses off the title with a grain of salt, "and they'll say, 'The
what, the what king?' I've even met some chefs at high-caliber
restaurants who don't have a clue."</LD>
<TE>   Sitting in the unheated office of his idyllic little spread near Ojai,
Carpenter piles on the kind of laments familiar to growers of everything
from cows to cabbage: The market is fickle. Nagging diseases can chew
away at your profit. If you're not careful, competition from inferior
goods can eventually nudge you off the nation's dinner plate and onto the
compost pile of obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of mousetraps sit on the floor and 11 pairs of knee-high
rubber boots--essential garb in the bird business--stand on a rack,
awaiting action. Nearby, you can hear the honeyed murmur of some 16,000
pigeons--a vast, otherworldly chorus of coos as sleep-inducing as a New
Age meditation tape.</TE>
<TE>   A lanky man with a sardonic wit, Carpenter has been living off the fat
of the squab for all of his 58 years. For three generations, his family
has bred the avian morsels, selling them to high-toned eateries back when
only the most benighted hayseed would wrinkle his brow and ask: "The
what? The what king?"</TE>
<TE>   Roasted squab on wilted watercress was the seventh of 11 sumptuous
courses the night the Titanic went down. Squab teased the palates of
moguls and movie stars; Carpenter's father and grandfather serviced such
elegant establishments as Ciro's and Romanoff's, where, Gary Carpenter
recalls, "even the garbage cans smelled wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   But times have changed. In 1965, the Cornish game hen--a hybrid
chicken introduced by poultry giant Tyson--started replacing the more
expensive and difficult-to-prepare squab even at the finer
establishments. "A terrible fraud," insists Carpenter, pointing out that
Cornish game hen is, after all, only chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the recession is doing no favors for breeders of a delicacy
that can hit the $30 range on menus of upscale restaurants. Even worse,
cheaper birds raised in Canada are clipping the wings of their American
counterparts, said Robert Shipley, president of Squab Producers of
California, a cooperative of about 75 members.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a robust market right now," said Shipley, whose Modesto
office sits at the center of the state's squab industry. "At high-end
places in San Francisco and New York, we've seen a real downturn in
demand."</TE>
<TE>   While the tiny pigeons still star at a number of well-known gourmet
restaurants, most of Carpenter's birds are trucked to wholesalers in Los
Angeles' Chinatown. Through them, he has managed to scratch a sizable
niche, selling to Asian restaurants throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "As the population has changed, we've benefited," said Carpenter, one
of the state's largest independent squab producers. Typically, California
producers have flocks only about 10% the size of his, according to
industry sources.</TE>
<TE>   Walking through rows of wood-and-chicken-wire coops, Carpenter checks
on his massive brood. Here, he scrutinizes a worker's notes on breeders'
productivity; there, he gently lifts a cooing, fist-sized ball of
feathers.</TE>
<TE>GQ Calls It a Top 10 Meal</TE>
<TE>   "Monday," he says. "This one will be ready on Monday."</TE>
<TE>   These pigeons aren't the winged rats that carpet-bomb the cityscape,
or the flying heroes that once flapped their way through enemy gunfire
with urgent messages. A squab's job is just to be born, to sit, and to
accept food regurgitated from its parents' beaks. After 28 days, the
fledgling is ready for anything--especially, say, a bed of mixed greens
and a sun-dried blueberry vinaigrette.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years ago, one of Carpenter's birds achieved immortality--or the
closest a squab can get to it--with its leading role in what GQ magazine
deemed one of the world's top 10 meals.</TE>
<TE>   John Downey, chef and proprietor of Downey's restaurant in Santa
Barbara, still serves the dish--squab roasted with cloves of garlic,
thyme and braised mustard greens.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to achieve a perfect medium-rare for the breast and legs,"
Downey says. "If it's in the well-done range, you're talking about an
entirely different piece of food."</TE>
<TE>   Doing squab right requires such meticulous care that Downey doesn't
serve it on his usually busy Saturday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, not all diners relish pigeon in any form.</TE>
<TE>   "Where I grew up in England, old-timers would talk about going up in
the hills in the winter, when times were hard, and shooting pigeons,"
Downey said. "Those birds are tough as boots; they're desperate food for
desperate times."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter--who prefers his baby pigeon barbecued--didn't set out to be
a third-generation squab man. A folk singer by avocation, he had planned
a career as a music agent. But a diagnosis of diabetes in his last year
of college convinced him that he'd stay healthier with a physically
active job in the family business.</TE>
<TE>   It was started in 1921 by his grandfather, physician Edwin Carpenter.
Fascinated by the science of genetics, he eventually quit medicine to
breed the perfect squab--hardy, broad-breasted and quick to multiply.
Edwin Carpenter failed in his quest, but a friend and rival, physician
G.M. Hubbell, succeeded.</TE>
<TE>Bragging Rights to a Top Breed</TE>
<TE>   Today, Gary Carpenter says, the birds in his flock are the only ones
descended from Hubbell's marvelous hybrids, despite claims to the
contrary from other squab ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone says they have Hubbells," Carpenter says. "It's kind of like
Acapulco Gold."</TE>
<TE>   Each week, he kills and plucks 1,000 delectable, month-old pigeons,
sending them from his shaded dell off the Casitas Pass to their destiny
at Chinese pleasure palaces and other fine eateries, such as Wolfgang
Puck's Postrio restaurant in San Francisco or Musso &amp; Frank's venerable
grill in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, their parents, who mate for life, breed like crazy. When
their reproductive urge fades in about 12 years, their fate is clear.</TE>
<TE>   "It's soup," Carpenter says, as unsentimental as any other farmer
about what might be called the coo de grace.</TE>

<HD>Skaters' Hard Sell Pays Off</HD>
<DH>Moorpark: Skateboard enthusiasts persuade panel to back a concrete
park rather than a cheaper modular one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to the pleas of a dozen skateboarders, the Moorpark
Parks and Recreation Commission has endorsed building a concrete skate
park, rather than a less-expensive modular model.</LD>
<LD>   Skaters prefer concrete to modular parks because of their speed,
resistance to weathering and consistency, said Mike Dillehay, owner of
Transition Board Shop in Moorpark. Dillehay was among those who addressed
the commission last week before it voted to recommend the City Council
build a concrete park with an in-ground bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "It stays the same, and you can continually [challenge] yourself to do
something bigger, better," Dillehay said.</LD>
<TE>   A modular, aboveground park costs about $220,000, while a
12,000-square-foot concrete park is about $310,000, said Mary Lindley,
the city's director of community services. Skaters and some commission
members said they plan to push for a 16,000-square-foot design that
includes an in-ground bowl.</TE>
<TE>Location for Park Still Undetermined</TE>
<TE>   Dillehay said he and his customers would be willing to raise money to
support the larger design.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way that we should be slighted," he said. "There's a lot
of kids in this town and they deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Joseph Catrambone said he had concerns about spending so
much money on a project only for kids who skate, but the skaters'
testimony impressed him.</TE>
<TE>   At its meeting next month, the commission plans to discuss where to
put the park. Options include Arroyo Vista Community Park or Griffin
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy they're doing it right, I almost don't care," Dillehay
said. Now most kids skate at Moorpark College, at public schools or in
parking lots, he said, "and they all get kicked out."</TE>
<TE>Commissioner Says He Understands</TE>
<TE>   Catrambone said he can relate to the skaters both through his
grandchildren and from his own childhood experiences.</TE>
<TE>   When Catrambone was a youth, he and his friends would cut boards into
30-inch sections and attach metal roller-skates to each end, creating
makeshift skateboards.</TE>
<TE>   They were nothing like the current boards, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't do a lot of crazy things like they do today," he said.</TE>

<HD>Board to Study Mental Health Service Deficiencies</HD>
<DH>Government: County supervisors will call on agency heads to explain
why many juvenile offenders are not getting needed evaluations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried that juvenile offenders aren't receiving needed mental
health services, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week will
summon an array of agency managers to explain why.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors ordered the session for their Tuesday meeting after
learning that judges are frustrated by an inability to get mental health
evaluations for juveniles brought before them on criminal offenses.</LD>
<LD>   Judges say the reviews are critical in deciding which offenders might
be deterred from further criminal activities through psychological
counseling and other county-provided services.</LD>
<TE>Conflict Between 2 Agencies Seen</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to solve the problem, the board last week approved the
transfer of one senior psychologist from the Behavioral Health Department
to the Probation Agency.</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston has also been mediating
conflicts between the two departments over which is responsible for
picking up the costs of providing evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   "I will make sure they are cooperating," Johnston said. "If they
don't, then you take it to the next level. That's when you replace
generals."</TE>
<TE>   The Behavioral Health Department, headed by Dr. David Gudeman, has
protested that it does not have enough money to provide all the services
needed. But Ventura County was forced to return more than $1 million to
the state this year because it failed to provide mental health services
that were covered entirely by state funds.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not doing as well with the money as we could if everyone was
rowing in the same direction," Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Remington, director of the Probation Agency, said he is ready to
take on the responsibility of providing mental health evaluations. The
agency had its own psychologists on staff in the past, so it is
essentially a return to prior practices, Remington said.</TE>
<TE>   Health Care Agency Director Pierre Durand, who oversees mental health
services, said he would not object to transferring some of Behavioral
Health's duties to the Probation Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Probation should take the lead in providing a resolution for these
kids," Durand said.</TE>
<TE>   John Flynn, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, said he welcomes a
"healthy discussion" of the conflicts. But he said supervisors should not
get bogged down in trying to fix the system's funding complexities,
focusing instead on policies.</TE>
<TE>   One thing he will suggest, Flynn said, is making rehabilitation of
juvenile offenders a priority when the county opens its new $64-million
juvenile hall complex in September 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Is its purpose to punish kids? Or is its purpose to try to correct
their behavior?" Flynn asked. "If it's to correct their behavior, the
health issues have to be discussed, and it has to be a complex that
delivers health care."</TE>
<TE>Collapse of Merger Led to Troubles</TE>
<TE>   The county's Behavioral Health Department was criticized three years
ago when its manager at the time, Steve Kaplan, sought to merge it with
the county's social services agency. Kaplan said his intent was to better
integrate the county's mental health services, including those provided
to juvenile offenders.</TE>
<TE>   But the merger was rescinded after federal officials said it was
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting turf wars among department managers indirectly led to a
federal audit of Medicare billing practices that cost the county more
than $25 million in repayments and fines.</TE>
<TE>   County officials now privately acknowledge that the system began to
fall apart after Kaplan was fired and replaced by Gudeman, a psychiatrist
with little experience in managing a $45-million government agency.</TE>
<TE>   Durand, Gudeman's boss, defended the psychiatrist's administrative
skills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a very difficult three years for him," Durand said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very well qualified and his heart is in the right place."</TE>

<HD>Mahony Dedicates Church--Finally</HD>
<DH>Renovation: St. Paschal Baylon in Thousand Oaks, though 40 years
old, hadn't been blessed for worship until Sunday's service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be wrong to call Sunday's special Mass at St. Paschal
Baylon Catholic Church a rededication ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony traveled from Los Angeles to bless the
newly renovated Thousand Oaks church, anointing with oil and incense the
walls, altar and baptismal font.</LD>
<LD>   And hundreds of parishioners, many of whom reached deep into their
wallets to help pay for the improvements, packed the 40-year-old
sanctuary as it was formally dedicated for worship.</LD>
<TE>   But in researching the history of St. Paschal's, church leaders
discovered that the current building had never been dedicated to begin
with.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony took care of that oversight Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   In a Mass that stretched for more than two hours, Mahony officially
launched a new chapter for the fast-growing church, which has undergone
an extensive face lift in recent years designed to break down barriers
between parishioners and clergy and make for a more effective ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an active Catholic community and it continues to grow,"
Mahony told the congregation moments after following a procession of
priests and altar boys into the church. "This [renovation] brings people
closer together and closer to where the Scriptures are preached."</TE>
<TE>Renovations In Line With Vatican Reforms</TE>
<TE>   The $2-million modernization project included spiffing up the parish
hall and school. But the core of the remodeling centered on changing the
configuration of the church building, to bring the rites of worship in
line with Vatican reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "So often, the configuration of our worship space has been in the form
of a theater, so that people are out there being observers of what is
taking place," said Msgr. Joseph George, spiritual leader at St. Paschal.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since Vatican II, the emphasis has been to draw them more into
the celebration as participants," he said. "This is part of our master
plan to provide resources and facilities that can help people help the
parish in the work it has to do."</TE>
<TE>   The idea, George said, was to move worship off a pedestal and bring it
closer to the people.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders moved the altar 15 feet closer to parishioners and
placed traditional wooden pews and cushioned folding chairs on three
sides.</TE>
<TE>   The baptismal font was moved to the front of the church to remind
parishioners that they became members of the church through baptism.</TE>
<TE>   Other improvements included adding a vestry and a multi-purpose room
at the front of the church building and updating the lighting and sound
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the renovation cost--about $1.8 million--was pledged by
parishioners.</TE>
<TE>Church Officially Opened Christmas Eve</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make our building reflect our faith," said Betty Reyes,
a parishioner since 1989 and the church's director of worship.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has been absolutely wonderful in coming together to make
this happen," she said. "And now we have a home where God and his people
can come together and worship."</TE>
<TE>   The church officially reopened for worship to the parish's 4,200
families on Christmas Eve.</TE>
<TE>   But George said Sunday's ceremony marked a new beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I really think it's a new chapter in the life of the people and of
this specially consecrated worship space," he said. "Hopefully, the
resources we have will encourage the spiritual growth of our people and
will allow us to be more zealous in the mission we have."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Suzanne Ensminger, director of adult education at the church,
said that all of the remodeling had been a welcome change but that
Sunday's visit by Mahony and his words were the most inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   "The best was saved for last," she said.</TE>

<HD>Fullerton's Airport: It's More Like a Way of Life</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Longtime friendships and a communal love of flying define
a long-established, down-home facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fullerton Municipal Airport doesn't look like much: an asphalt
landing strip, an air traffic control tower and boxy, nondescript
buildings.</LD>
<LD>   But people who frequent the 74-year-old field say it's a place where
dreams are born. More than that, it's where they come true.</LD>
<LD>   Here, lifelong friendships are forged over a daily cup of coffee.
Aspiring airline pilots fly solo for the first time. And corporate
executives can shed their suits and ties to become fighter pilots for a
day, staging mock dogfights.</LD>
<TE>   "There's not another place like this in the world," said Ira Brummel,
75, a retired developer who has been coming to the airport since the
1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The airport has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a former
pig farm when crop-dusters landed on the site as far back as 1913.
Placentia citrus ranchers William and Robert Downing founded the airport
in 1927, silencing critics who declared the parcel good only "for raising
bullfrogs."</TE>
<TE>   By 1948, it was the fourth-largest airport in the state and nicknamed
the "Fullerton Air Force" by the Federal Aviation Administration because
of the 200 planes based there, compared with 96 at Orange County Airport,
which would become John Wayne Airport. In the 1970s, the airport, then
flanked by businesses and apartment complexes, held as many as 600
planes, with a months-long waiting list for hangar space.</TE>
<TE>   Once there were at least 27 airfields in Orange County. Today, only
three remain: Fullerton, John Wayne and the Los Alamitos Naval Air
Station. In fact, general-aviation airfields--for private but not
commercial aircraft--have been disappearing across the state. About 30
such airports have closed statewide since 1976, according to the
California Pilots Assn.</TE>
<TE>   And each time there's a crash involving a small plane, critics' voices
rise again to call for more regulation, more security. On Jan. 5,
Whittier pilot Don Dirian died when he mysteriously nose-dived into a
field in Buena Park, half a mile from the Fullerton runway. On the same
day, in Florida, a 15-year-old boy stole a plane and crashed into a Tampa
office tower.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the cross hairs," said Rod Propst, manager of the city-owned
and -operated airport. "There's no question about it."</TE>
<TE>   The two incidents raised very different issues. The Florida crash,
coming after the terrorist slaughter of Sept. 11, sparked a broad debate
about whether private planes and pilots should get more scrutiny. In
Fullerton, neighbors immediately questioned the safety of having an
airport so close. Some spoke to the news media about petition drives and
flight-path changes and complained about the number of planes. But Propst
said nobody had called him. And so far, there are no plans at City Hall
to change things.</TE>
<TE>   Such criticism rises and ebbs whenever a crash makes news. In
Fullerton, there have been 17 fatal crashes since 1960, killing 34
people, including one bystander, Propst said.</TE>
<TE>   It all comes at a time when general aviation, though still popular, is
on the decline. Fewer people are flying because of the higher cost of
lessons, insurance and aircraft. Veterans by the thousands, who were
military-trained or paid for lessons through government grants after
World War II and the Korean War, are dying off. And in cities across the
country, developers are hungrily eyeing such prime property, flat and
unfettered.</TE>
<TE>   At Fullerton, many aviation lovers refuse to even consider the idea
that someday even their beloved field might be closed.</TE>
<TE>   "The dream of flying is never going to go away," said Bill Griggs Jr.
of Aviation Facilities Inc., a flight training center at the airport.</TE>
<TE>A Busy Airport, Once Much Busier</TE>
<TE>   On any given day, there is a steady stream of pilots from Fullerton,
Whittier, La Mirada and other surrounding communities. Wide-eyed children
sit on benches in the observation patio, clutching their 40-cent cans of
Mug Root Beer.</TE>
<TE>   The airport may be a little past its prime, but it still averages
roughly 100,000 takeoffs and landings a year. That's more than one-fourth
the number at John Wayne, the county's only commercial airport. But the
number represents half the business Fullerton had when general aviation
in the United States hit its peak in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton isn't as busy as Van Nuys, considered one of the nation's
busiest general-aviation airports. But it is unique in other ways. The
City Council has a deep, long-standing commitment to the airport's
success. After Sept. 11, for example, city officials voted to forgive 20
days of rent in September because FAA restrictions prevented many small
planes from flying.</TE>
<TE>   The airport relies on no city general fund money for its $1-million
operating budget. It generates its own revenue by leasing to businesses
or renting hangars and tie-downs to pilots, Propst said.</TE>
<TE>   Capital improvements, including the current $2.5-million repaving and
runway-widening project, are funded by the FAA. Propst said the airport
is now the benchmark for security at small airports, with a 24-hour video
surveillance system, gate cards and a satellite police station on the
premises.</TE>
<TE>   All this after acquiring the dubious distinction in 1999 of leading
the country in airplane thefts. Four of 16 planes stolen nationally were
taken from the Fullerton field.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a victim of being naive," Propst said, pointing to what's
left of a 4-foot-high fence that used to surround the 86-acre airport.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite external events such as terrorism and security,
urbanization and increased air restrictions, Fullerton is a throwback to
an earlier era in aviation. Somehow, the communal atmosphere that
developed over the decades has remained intact.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost like "Cheers," where everybody knows your name. In case
they don't, there's a photo chart of regulars hanging in the tower
entryway--although "half of 'em are dead," said La Palma pilot Ron
Hagerman, 64, who has been drinking coffee for 30 years at Tartuffles,
the airport restaurant Propst likens to a 1950s-style diner.</TE>
<TE>   Locals say the food is good and cheap, and the waitresses are
friendly. The first customers arrive at 7 a.m., when the restaurant
opens, sometimes even a few minutes early. They take their seats at the
"pilots' table." Then a second wave of regulars, who the first group
jokes are older and not as handsome, arrive after 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Some are military veterans. Most are retired. They have one common
bond: They love flying.</TE>
<TE>   They ponder current events and household problems. On a recent day, a
group whose members have known one another for at least 30 years gathered
around a table littered with more than a dozen Rubik's cube knockoffs.</TE>
<TE>   It seems Ira Brummel has been trying to unload thousands of them for
years--cubes in every shape and size. No one is sure what the real story
is, but Brummel swears he bartered a truckload of them for a fourplex in
Madera, a city north of Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   He gives them away to children who come into the restaurant. Take some
extras, he says, for your brothers and sisters.</TE>
<TE>   More old friends arrive. Hagerman glances at the table. "You still
have puzzles?" he says with an incredulous shake of his head.</TE>
<TE>   Other airport regulars call these men the "airport bums." They have
nicknames such as "Ready Eddie" and "the Richest Man in Fullerton." Fred
Gayton, a retired CBS cameraman, remembers the days when the airplanes
were stacked up seven deep in the approach pattern to land because
traffic was so heavy.</TE>
<TE>The Breakfast Club Serves Up Lots of Ribs</TE>
<TE>   Jim McGee was there when the FAA tower, the first one in Orange
County, opened in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll see the same guys in that restaurant and they're solving the
ills of the world right there," chuckled Denise Jennings, marketing
director at Air Combat USA, which lets customers live out dogfight
fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   The regulars pester one another mercilessly and offer up a chorus of
yawns at their stories, which have been repeated for years. One old-timer
used to claim, "You can't buy a minute's worth of respect around here for
a $100 bill."</TE>
<TE>   No matter. Every morning, the seats are filled.</TE>
<TE>   Such loyalty and longevity is a difficult thing to explain unless
you've visited the Fullerton Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Michael Blackstone, an American Airlines pilot who learned to
fly at Fullerton and made his first solo flight at the airport when he
was 16. Now, in between piloting commercial jets, he runs Air Combat USA.
It's gained worldwide recognition, with visitors from as far as Hong Kong
who shell out $900 or $1,500 a pop to engage in simulated dogfights while
zipping and diving in the skies over Fullerton and Long Beach in real
military planes that can rival an F-16 in the G-forces it generates.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, every once in a while Blackstone considers moving his planes and
operation elsewhere. But, he said, the roots are too deep. The airport
has become "a place to hang out."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, it's convenient, a central location, without the traffic
jams and headaches he experiences at other, busier airports that serve
airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of the Fullerton Airport like that song 'Hotel California,' "
Blackstone said. "You can get out, but you never leave."</TE>

<HD>Yorba Linda's Old Town: New Visibility in Store</HD>
<DH>Cities: Unknown even to many residents, the zone would sprout new
retail and historical features. Planning Commission approval is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Richard Nixon was growing up in Yorba Linda in the early
1920s, his country home was just a short walk from Main Street. He
attended school a block west of Main, and his father helped build the
Friends Church a block to the east.</LD>
<LD>   Today, while the Nixon presidential library at his home site is an
international attraction, hardly any of its tourist traffic is aware that
downtown, now called Old Town, still exists. Many who live in Yorba Linda
barely know it.</LD>
<LD>   The city is trying to change that. In a major renovation plan for Old
Town, Yorba Linda hopes to couple an economic face lift with
preservation.</LD>
<TE>   "When you ask people where Yorba Linda's downtown is, it's hit or miss
whether they'd know it," said Patricia Haley, the city's community
development director. "We think our plans have a lot of promise."</TE>
<TE>   The city has slowly been buying property in the Old Town area, which
generally lies along Imperial Highway north of Yorba Linda Boulevard. It
has hired a consultant, Downtown/Main Street Visions of El Segundo, to
draft a proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The consultant's ideas will be unveiled before the city Planning
Commission on Wednesday night, with approval expected.</TE>
<TE>   Through a series of town hall meetings, much of the vision is already
known:</TE>
<TE>   * An overhead pedestrian bridge across Imperial just north of Yorba
Linda Boulevard would lead from the small Richard M. Nixon Park directly
to a new 70,000-square-foot retail center and a major parking structure.
It would provide easy walking access to Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   * Housing would be built along School Street, one block east of
Main--either condominiums or a complex for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   * Alleys just behind Main would be converted to narrow streets for
easier access to stores.</TE>
<TE>   * Some historic homes would be moved but preserved. One, a two-story
Craftsman built in 1911 and now empty, may wind up on the grounds of the
city's library, on Olinda Street, and converted to a historical or
children's museum.</TE>
<TE>   * Eventually, the city would also help some properties along its
one-block Main Street return to their historic ambience.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commission President Carl Boznanski calls the Imperial/Yorba
Linda intersection "the gateway to our city. Right now, people drive
along Imperial without a thought to what's there. We want to give them a
reason to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Boznanski and City Councilman Ken Ryan have been part of an ad hoc
committee working with the consultant. Both say they are surprised how
much unifying support the plans have received in a series of public
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "A critical component," said Ryan, "will be to create new retail that
will be compatible with the historic section. The pedestrian walkway, for
example, must be something aesthetic, not just utilitarian."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for wood siding instead of stucco for the exterior of the
retail center, in a style reminiscent of the old packinghouses. Jo Lyons,
spokeswoman for the Yorba Linda Historical Society, praises the plans for
fitting Old Town's atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Also solidly behind the proposal are merchants in the Old Town area.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been asking for something like this for years," said Nancy
Ferguson, who owns a stained-glass business on Olinda.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ruocco, a Main Street barber, has been attending all the public
meetings. The renovation can only benefit Main Street merchants, he said:
"We would become a destination; the place would be a lot more
public-friendly."</TE>
<TE>   Louis Scull, a Main Street property owner for 30 years, is more
guarded in his optimism.</TE>
<TE>   "The city came up with some plans in 1992, and then again in 1995, but
nothing ever came of it," he said. "So, you ask me if this is going to be
good for downtown? I have to say, we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Boznanski is well aware of those two attempts but said this one is
different. Now, the Planning Commission and City Council votes are there
to back a dramatic change. Also, the city is already negotiating
settlements with several businesses that will be forced out through
eminent domain proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Those people are the chief critics of the plans. For example, the
proposed retail center straddles what is now Arroyo Street, which has
numerous small industrial shops. Alex Mikkelsen, who has owned an auto
repair business there for 14 years, is angry about being closed down.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind progress, but the way this has been handled is
ridiculous," Mikkelsen said. "Nobody from the city has ever talked to me
about a price for my place. All they've told me is, 'You better get a
lawyer.' "</TE>
<TE>   Brandt Waterbury, owner of Sheffield's Interiors on Arroyo, said he
recently received a 90-day eviction notice from the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been here 29 years. My father died building up this business,"
Waterbury said. "It's just not fair."</TE>
<TE>   He and others had some forewarning. More than a year ago, the city
bought the property that Waterbury leases, and it is a lousy landlord, he
said, letting the roof leak and refusing to take care of other repairs.</TE>
<TE>   More resigned to his fate is San Vaccaro, who owns the Yorba Linda
Unocal 76 service station on Imperial between Main and Arroyo.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go, but there's no sense fighting it," he said. "The
city has been extremely fair to me so far. They've even agreed to lease
the business back to me until the time comes they need to tear it down.
You can't beat that."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Ryan said he thinks the only shop owners at odds with the
city are those who want more by way of settlement than their businesses
are worth.</TE>
<TE>   One unknown is how much tourist traffic will come from the Richard
Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, two blocks west on Yorba Linda Boulevard.
Ryan is convinced it will be a natural draw, that library visitors will
want to explore the small historic area, if not the new businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Boznanski of the Planning Commission said Wednesday's expected
commission approval would be only a first step. The city will need to
find a developer interested in a partnership to make the renewal happen.
Still, the plan is the first in 10 years to get city officials excited,
he said: "Old Town will still have its charm. It will just be
embellished."</TE>

<HD>From Dingy Mall to a Nice Place to Live</HD>
<DH>Revitalization: County officials want to turn run-down
unincorporated parcels into attractive affordable housing. State has
nudged them along.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It means "plaza of gold." Yet the Plaza de Oro strip mall near
Anaheim hardly glitters.</LD>
<LD>   There is no plaza, just a massage parlor, pawnshops and other run-down
storefronts, all surrounded by a sea of cracked blacktop.</LD>
<LD>   But Esther Wallace thinks this relic can shine anew--by replacing it
with homes.</LD>
<TE>   "This place could be retrofitted with nice houses," said Wallace,
chairwoman of the West Anaheim Neighborhood Development Council. "There
is no place around here for young families to buy a home. We could level
this and transform it into a great neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   With nudging from the state, county officials are starting to listen
to Wallace and others who are calling for major changes within Orange
County's isolated pockets of unincorporated land. Planning officials have
been checking dozens of properties, searching for underutilized plots
that could help ease the county's housing crunch.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure is on. Last summer, state housing officials sent the
county a letter warning that it doesn't have enough affordable rental and
owner-occupied housing to meet the needs of low-income people, and hasn't
created enough incentives for builders to encourage construction of
inexpensive homes.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with a bill gaining steam in the state Senate that would punish
local governments that fail to meet affordable housing quotas, Orange
County officials are scrambling to find ways to get units built. In the
process, planning officials say they are hoping to turn the many
unattractive, semi-vacant properties blemishing the county's "islands" of
unincorporated land into desirable neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   It comes, too, as the region's largest landowners prepare to develop
the remaining swaths of undeveloped county land. The planning department
is shifting its emphasis toward decaying urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   "We need places to house low-wage workers, and we want to revitalize
the civic core of these neighborhoods," said Thomas B. Mathews, director
of the county Planning and Development Services Department. "Bringing in
working families is the best way to do that."</TE>
<TE>Key to Nice Housing Is in the Planning</TE>
<TE>   Such efforts require a balancing act. The county wants to attract
developers, but also include enough restrictions in building permits to
prevent the creation of overcrowded housing projects.</TE>
<TE>   "We're envisioning projects that are landscaped, with walking paths
and attractive architecture," Mathews said.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Boone, who has been involved in similar projects as the economic
development director for Orange, said requirements need to be
thoughtfully considered. "If they zone for high density without attaching
any strings, they could wind up with more slums in 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia P. Coad, chairwoman of the county Board of Supervisors and a
force behind the revitalization program, says the county will approve
only those plans that have the support of the neighborhoods affected.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to do this in a hit-or-miss method that duplicates
failures of the past," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the county is reviewing more than 1,000 acres in the more
urbanized northern islands. The planning department will recommend that
supervisors rezone 10 county islands surrounded by the cities of Anaheim
and Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at the islands that have been most neglected," Coad
said.</TE>
<TE>   After the rezoning is approved, it is up to landowners to decide what
to do next. They aren't required to change a thing. But planning
officials are betting that many of the properties aren't generating much
income for their owners, and that builders will be eager to buy them to
build affordable housing, especially if the county subsidizes them.</TE>
<TE>   "We can offer all kinds of incentives to landowners to come in and
work with us," said Josh McDonnell, a senior planner for the county.
"We're hoping to convert structures like half-occupied strip malls into
nicely designed developments."</TE>
<TE>   And not just strip malls, but run-down hotels, storage lots and auto
depots as well.</TE>
<TE>   In La Colonia Independencia, for example, a school district bus depot
sits in the middle of a dense residential area popular with elderly
residents. Local activists say the site is an example of a place that
should be converted for residential use.</TE>
<TE>   So far, county planners won't say which sites they have in mind, but
stress that they intend to work closely with community groups once the
zoning changes are adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone shares the same vision, however.</TE>
<TE>   The state is pressuring the county to create homes for low-income and
very-low-income residents. That would include inexpensive rental housing
and homes that sell for less than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents and community activists complain that north Orange
County has too many rentals and overcrowded multifamily units. They want
higher-end projects, which they say are the best way to revitalize their
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "We have enough cheap apartments around Anaheim already," Wallace
said. "We have more than anyplace else in the county."</TE>
<TE>   Even Supervisor Coad blames cheap rental units in North County for
attracting undesirable elements--"transients," "prostitutes," and
"parolees."</TE>
<TE>   "We want to bring in working families," Coad said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the issue of how many dwelling units are packed into one
area. Some county planners say they might like to see density on par with
a place such as downtown Brea. Residents in some county islands worry
even that would be too crowded.</TE>

<LD>A Costa Mesa convenience store clerk suffered minor injuries Sunday
after a man hit her in the head with a blunt object before grabbing money
from the cash register, police said. The man fled California Stop Market
in a silver Buick after the 2 p.m. robbery, said police Sgt. Tim
Schennum.</LD>
<LD>   As he backed out of the store parking lot on West 19th Street, he
crashed into a minivan, Schennum said. Police believe he and the driver
may have exchanged words. They are searching for the minivan driver, who
they hope can provide the man's name or license plate number.</LD>
<LD>   Schennum declined to say how much money was taken in the robbery.</LD>
<TE>   The store employee was treated at a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Police spent Sunday afternoon searching for the Buick, which was
described as old, but with fresh body damage to its rear.</TE>

<HD>Drawing a Bead on Gun Sales</HD>
<DH>Law: Irvine councilman drafts one of the state's toughest
ordinances for one of its safest cities. Firearms rights lobbyists
already are up in arms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI considers Irvine one of the nation's safest cities, a
master-planned community where nagging issues range from lawn maintenance
to the early morning howl of leaf blowers.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a new debate in town: gun control.</LD>
<LD>   A city councilman has drafted a proposal that would be among the
toughest gun laws in the state, making it nearly impossible for new
retailers to sell firearms. All in a city where gun violence is minimal.</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Chris Mears' ordinance would make it illegal to sell
firearms within 1,000 feet of churches, schools, playgrounds or
city-owned buildings. And in Irvine, most every commercial center is
within a short walking distance of one or more of these.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simply an effort to provide us with a slightly greater degree of
local control and confidence about gun sales," said Mears. And just in
case there's a corner of the city where a gun dealer could set up
shop--something that won't be known until the proposal is studied--the
ordinance also would require the dealer to obtain a special business
permit, pass a background check conducted by police, carry liability
insurance and keep a log of all ammunition sales.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal already has raised the ire of anti-gun-control lobbies.</TE>
<TE>   "The ordinance is designed to harass and create bureaucracy and make
it impossible for gun dealers to do business in the city," said Chuck
Michel, an attorney for the Fullerton-based California Rifle and Pistol
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed ordinance, which won't come before the council for at
least a month, takes a different tack from state gun laws, which require
a 10-day waiting period for firearm purchases. Such cooling-off periods
give the Department of Justice time to screen a gun buyer's background
and check for felony convictions. Felons are prohibited from owning guns.</TE>
<TE>   According to a survey by Legal Community Against Violence, a San
Francisco-based organization that researches local gun measures, only
three cities in the state have adopted ordinances that mirror what Mears
is proposing--Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco. However, all three
cover a far-flung geography where guns can be sold in certain areas and
have a higher crime rate than Irvine, which has been ranked among the
nation's 10 safest cities of its size for the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of cities have experimented with restricted firearm
sales--limiting calibers, types of weapons or high-powered bullets--but
few have adopted ordinances that could result in an outright ban on the
sale of guns.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the small Northern California town of Lafayette came close,
imposing stiff restrictions on gun dealers, including a ban on gun stores
within 1,000 feet of a park, school or residential area.</TE>
<TE>   The city's sole gun dealer sued Lafayette and lost. He didn't
challenge the 1,000-foot restriction but a restriction on trigger locks.
City leaders said they haven't conducted measurements to determine
whether it would be illegal to sell guns in the city's small retail core.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had any others wanting to come in and set up shop since
then," said Lafayette City Atty. Charles Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine is not awash in gun retailers, either. A Big 5 Sporting Goods
near the city-run Alton Athletic Park sells rifles and ammunition, and
there are two licensed antique gun dealers. All would be exempt from the
proposed ordinance if it is adopted in its current state.</TE>
<TE>   Conforming to local gun ordinances is nothing new to Big 5, said
company spokesman Gabriel Friederitchsen.</TE>
<TE>   "There are already a number of cities that have implemented various
gun-control ordinances, and we abide by anything the local, state or
federal authorities require of us," Friederitchsen said.</TE>
<TE>Some Say Measure Is 'Feel-Good,' Ineffective</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Mears' colleagues are impressed by the proposed gun
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rather puzzling ordinance," Councilman Greg Smith said. "It
feels good, but it doesn't serve much of a purpose. It's just a
statement."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the proposal falls in line with past efforts in Irvine to
adopt "feel-good" ordinances that are largely symbolic, such as a
previous council's decision to declare the city a "nuclear-free zone."</TE>
<TE>   Michel, the rifle association attorney, said he hopes to persuade
Mears to tackle gun control in other ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Irvine's program wouldn't address the illegal purchase of guns
directly," Michel said. "There are other programs that don't require an
ordinance and that deal with this problem much more effectively, and the
dealers are happy to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Michel pointed to a program Anaheim implemented in August 2000 that
requires gun dealers to notify authorities immediately after someone has
been denied authorization to purchase a firearm.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the Department of Justice notifies the dealer of its
findings first. Sometimes, the justice department doesn't notify local
authorities right away--or at all.</TE>
<TE>   "What police in Anaheim did was go for a strategic alliance with the
gun dealers, so if a dealer gets a reject notice from the Department of
Justice, he calls the Anaheim Police Department right away," said Michel,
who worked with Anaheim in developing the program. "Then when the guy
goes to the store to pick up his gun, police can arrest him. So we get
these people off the street rather than let them slip off into the wind."</TE>
<TE>Anaheim's Program Results in Arrests</TE>
<TE>   So far, the program has resulted in about a dozen arrests, said
Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   "If we didn't have this program in place, we wouldn't have known about
those 10 to 15 people," Martinez said. "They wouldn't get the gun, but
there also wouldn't be any follow-through."</TE>
<TE>   Some cities have attempted to regulate adult businesses through
similar zoning ordinances, creating restrictions that prohibit the
businesses from operating within 1,000 feet of "sensitive" areas. But the
restrictions don't always hold up in court.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley fought for several years to regulate adult businesses
through a zoning ordinance. But last year, the U.S. Supreme Court let
stand an appeals court ruling that found the city had violated an
adult-club owner's 1st Amendment rights by denying him a zoning permit.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of gun-control measures say dealing with firearms is a
different game altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities don't have to have gun dealers in their community," said
Andres Soto, a policy analyst for Pacific Center for Violence Prevention,
which tracks and promotes local gun-control measures. "They have complete
local discretion over what they want and don't want within their city
limits."</TE>
<TE>   Soto credits local gun ordinances, such as the one Irvine is
considering, for a consistent decline in gun sales, and gun-related
deaths and injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "If you limit the number of conduits in which firearms come into a
community and you regulate those that exist, you clean up the business,"
he said. "The result is [fewer] guns are sold, and gun crime goes down."</TE>
<TE>   And using the 2nd Amendment as a legal argument to fight such
ordinances likely won't be accepted in court, said Andy Spafford, a
senior staff attorney for the Legal Community Against Violence.</TE>
<TE>   The 2nd Amendment says that since a well-regulated militia is
necessary "to the security of a free state, the right of the people to
keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."</TE>
<TE>   Spafford said he believes "The 2nd Amendment applies only to the
regulation of a state militia. . . . Since that isn't impinged upon by
regulating the location of gun dealers, you don't have a basis for
raising the 2nd Amendment as an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Mears, who said his proposed ordinance wasn't motivated by a
particular incident, said he's not trying to put Big 5 or the hobbyists
out of business. But he does want the city to pick up where state and
federal laws on gun sales leave off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we can do about the proliferation of gun violence in
society," Mears said. "And I think it's appropriate for us on a local
level to do what we can and say what kind of a community we want."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's no secret that two-time defending state champion Santa Ana
Calvary Chapel is struggling, but nobody could have predicted the
Eagles' results over the past two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The Eagles, winners of seven of the last nine state championships,
were thrashed by Bakersfield, 62-12, in a dual meet Jan. 5 and
finished 11th at the Doc Buchanan tournament over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Eagle Coach Joey Coughran said his team is short-handed because it
can't fill spots in the 112-pound, 189-pound and heavyweight classes
and injuries have created more holes in his lineup.</LD>
<TE>   "We just don't have anyone in some weight classes," Coughran said.
"That happens sometimes. We have about 25 guys on the team and a lot
of them are duplicate weights. And with the injuries, we're just not
at full strength right now."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Williams, ranked No. 1 in the state at 171 pounds, and Victor
Lugo, ranked No. 4 at 130 pounds, have not wrestled since placing at
the Reno Tournament of Champions on Dec. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Lugo, who has a knee injury, is out for the season. Williams, who
has a shoulder injury, is expected to return for the Five Counties
Invitational beginning Friday at Fountain Valley High.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vikings on the move: Covina Northview won the Nogales tournament
over the weekend for its fourth tournament victory of the season and
could be primed to turn some heads at the Five Counties Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be up there with the powers," Northview Coach David
Ochoa said. "We want to see if we can fight it out with the big
boys."</TE>
<TE>   James Clay (160 pounds), Sammy Saunders (112) and Aldo Secaida
(215) have been particularly good, though Secaida may miss Five
Counties because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something that will keep him out all season," Ochoa
said. "But we don't want to jeopardize the end of the season for this
weekend."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fit to be tied: When Temecula Valley and Moreno Valley Canyon
Springs tied for first in the Riverside County championships
Saturday, it was the first time in the 20-year history of the
tournament there were co-champions.</TE>
<TE>   Each team scored 252.5 points.</TE>
<TE>   "That's more rare than a no-hitter," Temecula Valley Coach Arnold
Alpert said. "I've never seen a tie at any tournament and I go to
about 10 a year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the city: Defending City Section champion San Fernando took
another hit last week when Ramon Perry was kicked out of school for
fighting on campus.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers didn't start practicing until early December because of
administrative issues and are still getting football players into
wrestling shape.</TE>
<TE>   "We're about a month behind everyone," Castillo said. "We didn't
start practice until December. We just didn't have the team ready to
go."</TE>
<TE>   Will German, who placed at state last season and is San Fernando's
top wrestler, didn't compete until Dec. 22. Castillo was unsure if
German would certify at 171 pounds or 189. German made 171 at the
North Torrance tournament.</TE>
