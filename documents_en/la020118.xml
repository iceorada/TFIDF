<LD>Artists, photographers and actors from "The Lord of the Rings"
mingled at Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica on Wednesday night at the
opening reception for a Pierre Vinet photography exhibition,
featuring stills from the movie.</LD>
<LD>   Vinet said he fell so in love with New Zealand, where the movie
was shot, that he bought two houses there.</LD>
<LD>   He also fell in love with the actors.</LD>
<TE>   "Liv [Tyler] is ... " But words failed. Instead Vinet, who is
French Canadian, kissed his fingers and offered an appreciative smack
of the tongue. Pointing to a picture of Ian McKellen as the wizard
Gandalf, Vinet told us that he spent two weeks on his knees, shooting
stills on the set of the minute hobbit house. "Once in a while you
would hear an 'Ouch!' and you would turn around to see if the person
behind you was OK, and you would knock your head on the ceiling."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the exhibit, the fellowship of the ring spent most of the
evening outside, smoking. We noted that McKellen smokes Dunhill,
Viggo Mortensen (who plays Aragorn) smoked Vinet's roll-ups and
Elijah Wood (the hobbit Frodo) smokes those awful cloves.</TE>
<TE>   McKellen insisted that gallery guests dispense with his honorific
Sir, and just call him Ian. (The actor was knighted in 1989.)</TE>
<TE>   During filming, Vinet called him Sir Ian, a dubious courtesy, the
thespian observed. "You can't quite tell with the French if they are
mocking the English."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he praised Vinet: "He has the eye of a Cartier-Bresson."
The actor also praised the even-tempered Peter Jackson, inventing an
adjective for the director. "He is very equilibriumable."</TE>
<TE>   Working on the movie was "the hardest, most difficult experience
of my career," said Wood, but "it was also the greatest."</TE>
<TE>   MTV personality Chris Connelly joked about Wood, who played a
3-foot-tall hobbit in the movie but stood tall on this night: "He
went to New Zealand a boy and came back a man."</TE>
<TE>   Flier Warranted</TE>
<TE>   When Jason Mewes, star of the new movie "RSVP," failed to show up
in Park City, Utah, this week for its Slamdance Film Festival
premiere, members of the film's production crew handed out wanted
fliers, not realizing (or so they claimed) that Mewes is indeed a
wanted man.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we were concerned because we hadn't heard from him,"
said "RSVP" publicist Alma Bogdan. "We weren't aware of any of his
problems."</TE>
<TE>   A judge recently issued a $50,000 bench warrant for Mewes arrest
after the actor failed to appear at a probation violation hearing in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Mewes, who gained fame playing a stoned slacker in the
Jay and Silent Bob movies, was sentenced to two years' probation
after he pleaded guilty to a felony heroin possession charge. He was
ordered to undergo substance abuse counseling and submit to random
urine testing. The probation violation hearing was scheduled after he
failed to meet with his probation officer.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know where he is. Really," she said. "We were just
trying to get him here so he could bask in the glory of the movie."</TE>
<TE>   In the Bet Room</TE>
<TE>   If the oddsmakers at Internetops.com are right, "The West Wing" is
the one sure thing among the dozens of nominees for Sunday's Golden
Globes with 1-1 odds to win. This is the first time that the Internet
sports betting site, which has set odds for the Oscars since 1996,
has set odds for the Golden Globes, which are given by the Hollywood
Foreign Press Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Best Bets: "The Lord of the Rings" for best movie drama (1-2),
"Shrek" for best movie comedy (8-5), Russell Crowe for best actor in
a drama (3-2), Sissy Spacek for best actress in a drama (6-5), Thora
Birch for best actress in a musical (8-5), Gene Hackman for best
actor in a comedy (3-5) and "Sex and the City" for best television
comedy series (6-5).</TE>
<TE>   Longshots: "The Man Who Wasn't There" for best movie drama (10-1),
Billy Bob Thornton for best actor in a drama (6-1), Tilda Swinton for
best actress in a drama (7-1), "Bridget Jones's Diary" for best movie
comedy (6-1), John Cameron Mitchell for best actor in a comedy (8-1),
Cate Blanchett for best actress in a comedy (5-1), "24" for best
television drama series (12-1), "Frasier" best television comedy
series (8-1).</TE>
<TE>   Company spokesman Kyle Fratini said three oddsmakers base their
decisions on "what critics have said about the movies and
performances. Then it just comes down to the simple math of it."</TE>

<HD>A Return to Glamour as Usual at Award Shows</HD>
<DH>Although the Emmys were toned down, the red-carpet sparkle
will reappear at the Golden Globes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there's a new, more restrained mood in Hollywood, the most telling
evidence of it will appear in the clothes that are paraded along the
red carpet at Sunday's Golden Globes awards ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Since November, when Emmy Award participants were asked to don
dressy business attire, instead of black-tie, as a show of respect
for victims of Sept. 11, the inner circle of celebrity image makers
has debated the role of flashy fashion at awards shows. The more
somber colors and conservative clothes that marked the
twice-postponed television awards were considered a possible portent
of the end of gratuitous glitz.</LD>
<LD>   Yet nothing, it seems, can take the sparkle out of Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   After all, Hollywood's red-carpet processionals, like its films,
have become part of Americana, as entertaining as the Super Bowl and
the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.</TE>
<TE>   "The red carpet has become a tradition," said Patty Fox, fashion
coordinator of last year's Academy Awards and author of "Star Style
at the Academy Awards" (Angel City Press, 2000). Black-tie glamour
has been a part of the Academy Award ceremonies for most of its
history, though beginning in 1942, the academy banned formal wear
throughout World War II. Ingrid Bergman even wore the same dress to
the 1944 and 1945 ceremonies. That would be unthinkable today.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Fox observed, "the red carpet is a hotbed of trend making"
that's synonymous with celebrity style. The Council of Fashion
Designers of America in 2000 even created a special award to
recognize the contributions of the red-carpet arrivals to fashion.
This year's VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards included a new red-carpet award
for well-dressed women stars.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the Oscars, and to a lesser extent, the nearly
three-dozen other televised show biz awards programs, has become an
international cultural experience. "It's a big fashion show. People
want to see who has taste and who doesn't," said wardrobe stylist
Deborah Waknin. "It keeps the public happy."</TE>
<TE>   As stylists for Globe nominees worked feverishly in the trenches
this week, tracking down gowns, debating shoe styles and finalizing
handbags for the black-tie event, Hollywood's dream-making machinery
was running in high gear once again. Beverly Hills hotel suites were
still full of companies eagerly plying their wares onto nominees and
presenters. The mood was upbeat for the first major awards show of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Though star advisors were careful to make clients appear dignified
at the Emmys, many say they feel an adequate amount of grieving time
has passed. "Hollywood is itching to get back to what it does best,"
said wardrobe stylist Vincent Boucher. "It's sort of like actors are
going back to doing their job, which is to be glamorous and a little
bit larger than life." Boucher noted that stars have been
re-embracing celebratory attire, such as the red gown on Marisa Tomei
and the sapphire-blue gown on Patricia Heaton at the recent American
Film Institute awards.</TE>
<TE>   The red carpet represents more than a fun fashion show for fans.
It's become a small industry in itself. When the Emmys were postponed
and the format radically changed, executives who had allotted
marketing money for the event were panicked about their present
investment and the future of their celebrity-linked strategies,
especially since some products never received exposure. If glitz
vanished, many worried that the public wouldn't tune into awards
shows to see stars in sensible business attire.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, ratings for the Emmys dropped 20% from the year before, in
part because they were up against the final game of the World Series.
Networks, which have embraced awards shows because they combine
inexpensive production costs with a high glamour quotient, have a lot
to lose. And dozens of fashion and beauty companies, not to mention
celebrity magazines, would have to find equally enticing lures to
their products.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, the temporary void left by the Emmys' changed format
seems to have prompted some fashion companies into pushing their
marketing efforts even harder. Victoria's Secret is already
announcing that it will create "diamond luxuries" for best-actress
Oscar nominees. Shoemaker Stuart Weitzman  is developing a $1-million
pair of platinum sandals aimed at the feet of a yet-unnamed Oscar
participant. Jeweler Harry Winston has just created a 30-carat brooch
that will be clipped to a special $390,000 satin evening bag for
Oscar night to promote its new line of $1,200 to $5,000
jewel-embellished bags.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, another company becomes more savvy about capitalizing
on its red-carpet exposure. Significantly, Harry Winston, where the
average sale is $100,000, has recently broken with its own exclusive
heritage to offer not only the bags, but also less expensive versions
of jewelry worn on the red carpet. When Gwyneth Paltrow accepted her
Oscar wearing a $160,000 Winston diamond choker, more than 200 people
called the company expressing interest in buying a version of the
one-of-a-kind necklace. "If it were today," said company spokeswoman
Carol Brodie, "we would be able to translate that piece into a
$30,000 or $40,000 necklace. I want people to look at that movie star
and, when they call the next day, be able to make a sale."</TE>
<TE>   Some companies are avoiding accusations of excess by tying their
promotions to charity. The Diamond Information Center asked 14
jewelers to create diamond necklaces to be worn at the Oscars, Globes
or Grammys. For each necklace that's worn, the jewelers will donate
$10,000 to the American Foundation for AIDS Research.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Oscars shepherd, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, is looking forward to the return of glamour.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going formal--it's definitely black-tie," said John
Pavlik, spokesman for the organization. "People come to expect this.
We want to live up to people's expectations as much as we can," he
said. "I think recovery is well on its way. We want to help that
along by looking as good as we can."</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, the awards shows are fun. "It's not the cure for
cancer," said Boucher, "but we all need a little humor in our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Times fashion writer Booth Moore contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>So Far Out, His Music Had to Come Back In</HD>
<DH>Esquivel's swanky sounds of the '50s and '60s set the
Cocktail Nation tone decades later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like his screwball, one-of-a-kind music, Juan Garcia Esquivel's looks
had a slightly out-of-this-world quality. His smooth jawline and
sensuous mouth evoked the cliched image of a suave Latin Lothario.
But his thick, horn-rimmed glasses and tail-fin ears gave him the
geeky appearance of some distant kinsman of Buddy Holly, or perhaps
an interstellar higher life form masquerading as a Las Vegas lounge
lizard.</LD>
<LD>   The creative tension between these dueling personas is revealing,
not only about the eccentric bandleader-composer-pianist, who died
earlier this month at his home in Mexico at age 83, but about the way
Esquivel's wacky oeuvre has been repackaged by various listeners to
meet their own psychocultural needs.</LD>
<LD>   To hard-core devotees, Esquivel was a visionary, a recording
artist whose quirky wit and technical proficiency spawned new musical
hybrids in the 1950s and '60s. In a way, he can be seen as the
godfather of today's hip-hop samplers and electronica wizards, a
musical pack-rat who collected strange noises from across the planet
and wove them into kooky, catchy sound collages. John Zorn, the
avant-garde saxophonist and composer, has described Esquivel as "a
genius arranger" who "created a beautiful pop mutation."</LD>
<TE>   But in the last decade, after disappearing from the pop landscape,
Esquivel received a startling make-over. Plucked from bargain-bin
obscurity, he became a talisman of the so-called Cocktail Nation
movement, a mostly nostalgic exercise in drinking, dressing up in
vintage clothes and grooving to the sounds of yesteryear.</TE>
<TE>   In that process, Esquivel's aggressively weird, experimental
canon, with its bizarre instrumental combinations and heart-stopping
dynamic shifts, was recast as "space age bachelor pad music," the
ultimate aural aphrodisiac for young urban sophisticates. Today, in
record stores, you'll find his discs innocuously shelved under "Easy
Listening."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hollywood, where Esquivel labored for years, also has
rediscovered his music, inserting it into films such as the Coen
brothers' "The Big Lebowski" and "Beavis and Butt-Head Do America." A
movie based on his life, starring John Leguizamo, is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   How come the revival? Maybe because his prescient music triggers
both nostalgia for a stylish, hi-fi past, and optimistic faith in a
glowing, sci-fi future.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an entertainer before he was a composer," says Byron
Werner, an L.A. artist who began collecting Esquivel's out-of-print
LPs in the late '70s and distributing tapes to friends like "The
Simpsons" creator Matt Groening. It also was Werner, a digital artist
in special effects who has worked on movies like "Star Wars" and
"Titanic," who coined the term "space age bachelor pad music" to
describe the composer's extraterrestrial sound.</TE>
<TE>   A sly intellect matched to an exuberant temperament, Esquivel was
a brilliant-plumed serpent in the garden of Eisenhower-era America,
tempting middle-class suburbanites with strange new tastes. Known
professionally by his surname, with an exclamation point affixed
(Esquivel!), he concocted a life and an art that suggested a series
of amusing question marks.</TE>
<TE>   Born on Jan. 20, 1918, in Tampico, on the Gulf of Mexico, he led
big bands, scored for film, TV and radio, dressed like a '50s matinee
idol, palled around with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Liberace and
was said to have married six times (most recently his 25-year-old
health-care aide).</TE>
<TE>   His renown as a ladies' man was frequently noted by the press and
experienced firsthand by female reporters. "He would keep male
journalists on the phone for 30 minutes, the ladies two hours. And at
the end he would tell them, 'You are mucha muchacha,'" says Irwin
Chusid, a New Jersey-based music historian who served as Esquivel's
manager in the last years of his life. Chusid also produced two
Esquivel CDs for the Bar/None label, "Esquivel! Space Age Bachelor
Pad Music," and a follow-up, "Esquivel: Music From a Sparkling
Planet," which together have sold more than 100,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   But Esquivel's colorful personality and active libido were mere
sideshows to his emphatic artistry. A prodigy who put together his
first 15-piece ensemble when he was just 17, Esquivel was already a
legend of Mexican TV, radio and nightclubs when RCA Victor brought
him under contract to the United States in 1958. Working in both
Hollywood and New York, he found mass-market success composing TV
scores ("The Bob Cummings Show," "The Tall Man"), appeared on
television himself and put together a successful stage show, "The
Sights and Sounds of Esquivel," in Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Continually sampling from a musical palette that included Latin,
pop, folk, avant-garde and even classical influences, Esquivel
produced a body of work that was playful, exciting, always
unpredictable and at least a quarter-century ahead of its time.</TE>
<TE>   While he also wrote and played music, his true genius lay in his
idiosyncratic arrangements, mostly of well-known jazz tunes and pop
standards--"Begin the Beguine," "Baia," "Sentimental Journey." Armed
with an engineering degree and fascinated with the ear-tickling
possibilities afforded by new stereophonic sound equipment, Esquivel
used multi-track recording, echo-chamber effects, exotic instruments
like the theremin (later made famous by the Beach Boys' "Good
Vibrations") and ambient dissonance to create surreal, futuristic
soundscapes.</TE>
<TE>   In a famous illustration of his meticulous technique, he recorded
the 1962 album "Latin-Esque" using two orchestras seated in separate
RCA studios a block apart in Hollywood, so as to obtain the "purest
stereo separation," Chusid says. On the new frontiers of '60s
orchestral sound, Esquivel was an intrepid pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating world beat's sonic eclecticism, Esquivel sampled
slide guitar, Chinese bells, jew's-harp, gourds, a timbal here, a
mariachi trumpet there. His timing couldn't have been better: U.S.
servicemen and women returning from World War II brought home a
penchant for "exotic" sounds, everything from Weimar cabaret ballads
to Polynesian folk tunes.</TE>
<TE>   But while it's possible to  pinpoint a "Latin" sound in his music,
Esquivel's cosmopolitan sensibility upended ethno-musical marketing
categories. "Juan did not want to be considered a 'Mexican'
bandleader," says Chusid. "He felt that his music had a more
pan-galactic flavor."</TE>
<TE>   Eschewing the silly romantic sentiments of mainstream pop,
Esquivel replaced lyrics with whistling or humming, augmented by
nonsensical choruses of "Zu-zu-zu" and "Pow! Pow! Pow!" His absurdist
sense of humor, compressed into short sound bursts, gave his music a
cartoon-like animation. But a haunting, minor-key undertow can be
felt in his arrangement, say, of "Begin the Beguine," whose ghostly
chorus and spooky xylophones bring to mind a tuxedoed big band of Day
of the Dead skeletons.</TE>
<TE>   Another of Esquivel's sonic signatures was his skilled
manipulation of dynamic extremes. Mischievously, he'd draw listeners
in with hushed voices and soft notes, then crank up the brass to
Wagnerian intensity. Like a well-mixed highball, his music goes down
smoothly, but with a wicked kick somewhere along the way.</TE>
<TE>   After divorcing his then-wife, singer Yvonne DeBourbon, in 1978
and returning to Mexico, Esquivel gradually fell off the American
pop-culture radar screen.</TE>
<TE>   But a revival was soon underway, led by artist Werner and his
friends. At the time, Werner was seeking an alternative to the
insipid pop-rock of the early '70s and the aesthetic tyranny of the
record industry.</TE>
<TE>   To Werner, Esquivel's music embodied a kind of Kennedy-esque
optimism and drive. In the '90s, that perky fortitude caught the ear
of the Cocktail Nation, a loose confederation of post-grunge 20- and
30-somethings eager to recapture the glamour of a bygone era, if only
for the space of a happy hour.</TE>
<TE>   With the gals sporting Jackie-O 'dos and cocktail dresses  and the
guys in Brylcreemed hair and sport coats,  Cocktail Nation clubbers
favored Atomic Age styles and retro-cool sounds. The Cocktail
phenomenon has accommodated a dizzying array of styles--Denny's
high-camp exotica, Julie London's torchy vocals, Dino and Frank's
lush-life anthems, Nino Rota's film scores for Fellini and Burt
Bacharach's mellow West Coast turtleneck pop.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of neo-retro bands like Combustible Edison, Love Jones
and the Swamp Zombies have lent an inspired, contemporary twist to
the Lounge Movement's swizzle-stick gestalt.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for the mass marketplace to catch on. Soon
Neiman Marcus was selling smoking jackets and liquor companies were
sponsoring cocktail parties. Esquivel's music was one of many
elements that got swirled into the slushy concoction of the "swank"
lifestyle, which peaked in the late '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Esquivel is gone and the Cocktail movement seems to be
fading, it may be easier to imbibe his music straight, without
distractions. A trapezoid peg who still refuses to fit into the
square hole of prepackaged trends, Esquivel insists on being listened
to carefully, not served up as an audio-aperitif to the rhythm of
clinking martini glasses.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the people that were attracted to it as a fad,
they've already left," Werner sums up. "And I hope those who were
really interested in the music will keep listening to it." Esquivel
fans would drink to that.</TE>

<LD>How Are Cartoons Made?</LD>
<LD>   In the early days of animation, everything in a cartoon frame,
from characters to background, had to be drawn on the same piece of
paper. This meant that the next frame had to be completely redrawn,
and the next and the next. Such animated classics as "Gertie the
Dinosaur" (1914) and early "Felix the Cat" (1920s) were created in
this time-consuming manner. A 90-minute feature film made this way
today could take up to 700,000 separate drawings!</LD>
<LD>   Around 1916, J.R. Bray developed an early version of a process
called cel animation. In this process, the elements in a scene that
moved were drawn on separate translucent sheets and placed over the
stationary parts of the picture. This meant that whatever didn't move
in a frame didn't need to be redrawn and marked a major advance in
the development of modern animation.</LD>
<TE>   You can learn more about animation at an exhibit at the Fullerton
Museum Center, "Superwacky: Animation on Television 1949-2002,"
starting Saturday through May 12. This exhibit looks at the art and
impact of TV cartoons through historic cels, background art,
merchandise and video clips. For more information on the exhibit or
upcoming Family Workshops, call (714) 738-6545 or visit
www.ci.fullerton.ca .us/museum.</TE>

<HD>The Rippled Effect</HD>
<DH>Delicate boys with that malnourished look are out. The
chiseled, just-hiked- Mt. Baldy look is in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Farewell, delicate Twiglet boy models who seem to have dominated the
international runways the last few years. Here comes a 21st century
update: a more athletic aesthetic of the ideal male who cares about
looking fashionably right in lean low-rise trousers and snug
sleeveless shirts.</LD>
<LD>   Think hunky, but not balloon-shaped crusher from the World
Wrestling Federation, either. Bodybuilder Lite, if you will--a cut
body as portrayed on television, in movies, men's magazines and in
fashion ads for the upcoming spring and summer.</LD>
<LD>   "Models were pumped up big time in the 1980s," says David Wolfe,
creative director of the Doneger Group, a New York fashion consulting
firm. "Then they went out of style and in came the skinny,
undernourished, druggie guys that designers thought were hip and
cool."</LD>
<TE>   Now comes the latest and more erotic physique: Cruise down the
Sunset Strip, between Crescent Heights Boulevard and Sweetzer Avenue,
and look skyward. Up there on a billboard is Calvin Klein's new
underwear model, Travis Fimmel, packed into low-waist briefs, showing
off a hard body of impeccable pectorals and abs that look like an ice
cube tray.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian cattle ranch boy credits his incredible body to
surfing, skiing and football. "I've never worked out, mate,'' says
Fimmel, who modeled briefly in Melbourne and Sydney. ''It doesn't
interest me.'' He is, after all, 22 and free spirited--arriving at
LAX last May with no job and only $60 of which he spent $20 on cab
fare to a friend's apartment and the rest partying that night. As
luck would have it, he landed work the next day at L.A. Models, which
led to his billboard-boy status.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to the ubiquitous crop of washboard-stomach cover
models in men's magazines such as Men's Journal and Men's Fitness.
Men's Health even offered readers a three-week workout program last
month to achieve the current ''cover-model body.'' And for your
consideration, take a look at a shirtless Tom Cruise on the cover of
this month's Vanity Fair. He follows last month's cover boy Brad
Pitt, claiming bragging rights to a six-pack of bare, not beer.</TE>
<TE>   Even bodies of fiberglass are getting reshaped--Fimmel-like. The
new Flex line of mannequins by Patina-V in the city of Industry has a
"lifestyle physique," says George Martin, vice president and creative
director. His updated mannequins, which have gone from a traditional
size 40 to 42, stirred industry buzz almost immediately after they
were introduced last month at a New York trade show. In late
February, Flex will be unveiled at Euroshop, another industry show
held every three years in Dusseldorf, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Today's body-conscious man is bigger and more muscular on top and
narrower in the waist, says Jack Herschlag, executive director of the
National Assn. of Men's Sportswear Buyers in New York. "I remember a
time when a size 42 suit used to commonly have a waist 36." Now it's
a 42 regular with a 32 waist-- "that's an extreme drop and what we in
the business call an athletic fit that's very 'in' right now.''</TE>
<TE>   Says Crista Klayman, an L.A. Models runway director, "Guys are not
getting 'cut' by being on the couch. They're outside doing stuff.
Used to be that in the past we'd page male models and find them being
gym rats. Now you find more and more guys surfing and playing
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   "Blame it on California," says history professor Lynne Luciano, of
Cal State University Dominguez Hills. She attributes the body-image
culture here to the great outdoors lifestyle and the birthplace of
the modern gym and the health food crusade. The author of "Looking
Good: Male Body Image in Modern America" (Hill &amp; Wang, 2001) also
says fashion has always played into how one perceives his or her body
image.</TE>
<TE>   "Clothing styles, especially for American men, have become much
more casual, tighter and revealing with the arms and chest exposed
with see-through garments. So it's only natural that men would want
to show off what they work so hard to achieve in the gym," she says,
adding that baby boomers and older men might visit a plastic surgeon
for pectoral or calf implants and other body-enhancing treatments.</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret that men will go to extremes to get the body they
want. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons reports that in the
year 2000--its most recent statistics--more than 1 million men, an
all-time high, had cosmetic surgery, including liposuction, which has
soared 500% since 1992, when the group began keeping records.
Granted, the male grooming ritual is undergoing a radical
transformation, embracing an arsenal of products--toning lotions,
anti-aging creams and hair tonics--to support a $3.5-billion annual
market.</TE>
<TE>   Luciano says her research shows that men--from the health and
fitness fad on Santa Monica's Muscle Beach in the 1930s to the Mr.
Universe days of Arnold Schwarzenegger to today's commercialization
of body image--have been obsessed with their looks, body shape and
physical fitness for reasons from the workplace to romance to sheer
narcissism.</TE>
<TE>   Man's quest for physical perfection could take him to extremes
such as using steroids or worse, an obsessive preoccupation with
one's muscularity and size, which is medically known as "body
dysmorphic disorder," Luciano says. "It's like someone with anorexia
looking in the mirror and seeing an overweight person that isn't
there, only with body dysmorphia a man who is in great shape sees the
opposite--a puny person without the bigger pecs, the washboard
stomach."</TE>
<TE>   Men are coming under the same pressures of objectification that
women have experienced, and sometimes the perfect physical ideal is
unattainable. "Nowadays, it's about asking yourself if you look
athletic and vigorous or do you look tired, sloppy or overweight,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Paris, author of "Prime" (Perigee, 2002), is a former Mr.
America and Mr. Universe. The Los Angeles-based author of several
fitness books says the shift to muscular frame has sped up in the
last six years, especially among baby boomers who find themselves in
competition with younger guys in the workplace or want to look sexier
and more appealing in the latest fashions. "But the look is not about
having a competitive bodybuilder's frame because even popular culture
rejects that cartoon image."</TE>
<TE>   The more refined aesthetic look is exactly what Martin wanted for
his Flex mannequins when he hired as his model Sierra Madre personal
trainer Phillip Gallasch, 24, who has played football, water polo and
is trained in martial arts.</TE>
<TE>   Gallasch, who posed for almost two weeks for sculptor Justin Poole
last spring, says more than 85% of his male clients, many who are
middle-aged guys, want a chiseled mid-section.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Zadowicz, another sculptor, worked with three other models
of various ethnic backgrounds to create the heads for the Patina-V
collection.</TE>
<TE>   It was time to break the mold and give the old models of
masculinity a make-over that begins with pumped-up pecs, rippled
torso, muscular thighs and taut buns that give new meaning to the
words "tight end."</TE>
<TE>   The three new sculpted shapes appear as if they are in motion, the
better to show off a well-defined back, a broader shoulder and a
32-inch waist. They definitely are a departure from the
posture-perfect dummies and headless abstract models of the last
decade.</TE>
<TE>   The change comes at a time when there's a resurgence of interest
in using mannequins. "It's all about putting reality back in the
stores and what consumers, especially male consumers, can best relate
to," says Dan Evans, president of the National Assn. of Display
Industries, a Florida trade group.</TE>
<TE>   The Flex mannequins will begin appearing in Kohl's Department
Stores in the Midwest later this year and in Southern California in
spring 2003 when the chain opens 30 stores, says Jerry Neal, a vice
president for the Wisconsin-based company. ''There have been
body-conscious mannequins before, but it's been awhile since we've
seen a male collection that is proportionately muscular without being
overdone.''</TE>
<TE>   But, warns fashion consultant Wolfe of the Doneger Group, be
prepared for the next new pop culture image of masculinity--a hero
who happens to look, not surprisingly, like a firefighter who can
rescue you from a falling building. "Big and tough," Wolfe says. "And
all heart."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIELA PETROFF</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MILAN, Italy</DL>
<LD>Designers are calling their army of male fashion followers to order:
No more haphazard style, no grunge, funk or other offbeat fashion
statements.</LD>
<LD>   The time has come for staid, elegant dressing. This is the
fall-winter 2002-2003 message from designers who showed their
menswear collections this week.</LD>
<LD>   Starting from traditional oxfords and loafers for footwear, Prada
shaped a silhouette based on the classic male wardrobe, where detail
makes the modern difference. A camel-hair coat, for example, is
turned inside-out to reveal the waterproof lining; classic slacks
have a silk waistband; a zipper replaces buttons on a plain white
shirt. At the same time, a tailored, three-piece tweed suit is worn
with a baseball cap and multicolored running shoes.</LD>
<TE>   Ralph Lauren made his European debut showing his elegant Purple
Label collection. Some see the descent of the American designer on
Milan as a challenge to Giorgio Armani, undisputed icon of the "made
in Italy" tailored style. But Lauren denied it in an interview with
the International Herald Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not taking on Armani; I'm not taking on anyone," he said.
Lauren said his goal was simply to make an impact in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   He had no reason to worry. His collection of three-piece tweed
suits, lounge jackets in silk and velvet, tails coupled with rugged
jeans and a heavy knit turtleneck received a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the mood for ultra-elegance, Tom Ford for Gucci presented
a series of tuxedos and coat and tails that are sure to be the hit of
next year's gala events. Ford matched his exquisite outfits with
jeweled buttons and stiff, colored evening shirts minus the
traditional bow tie.</TE>
<TE>   Gucci's daytime wear harkens back to the 1930s, with wide-lapeled,
double-breasted jackets paired with oversized trousers, ostentatious,
fur-lined trench coats and wide-brimmed fedoras covering slicked-back
hair. A silk scarf is tied provocatively around the neck, but Ford
prefers a simple V-neck T-shirt to the traditional shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Armani is famous for producing perfectly balanced collections with
just the right proportion of tradition, innovation and good taste,
and this show was no exception.</TE>
<TE>   Daytime was a perfect mixture of classic single-breasted suits to
wear to the office, double-breasted  for a more suave look, knit
sweaters and casual slacks. Overcoats were mainly based on the trench
coat, with oversized buttons, but no belt. Classic lace-ups were the
favorite footwear.</TE>
<TE>   Armani also embraced the return to formal evening wear with a
series of minimalist tuxedos whose high black collar over a white
shirt lent a priestly air to the collection.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, he has been trashing the glitz of the fashion world with
such statements as "luxury disgusts me" and "elegance should be
available to all." His Emporio collection was dedicated to the
working class.</TE>
<TE>   As for how he will reconcile this new ethic with designer prices,
Armani pointed out that a pair of his Emporio jeans costs less than
$100, one-tenth the price of an upscale Armani suit.</TE>
<TE>   Donatella Versace embraced the "real guy" look, featuring a casual
West Coast style of jean vests and motorcycle jackets. But she
couldn't let go of the rock 'n' roll glam that has become the
trademark of her menswear, with elaborate Gothic designs adorning
luxurious silk shirts and lavish brocade coats. For the first time
she used a personalized logo, DV, that appeared on ties and almost
everywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   The Fendis, always quick to find new ways to carry money--witness
the success of the  "baguette" handbag--brought back the "borsello,"
the  men's handbag popular in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Dolce &amp; Gabbana came up with a melting pot of different types,
from the boyish rascal to the refined gentleman. There is the jock in
the parka with the fox fur-trimmed hood, the country farmer in his
best Sunday suit, the university intellectual with hand-knit pullover
and extra long scarf, and the dandy with his elegant blouse and
velvet trousers.</TE>
<TE>   To underline their theme, the duo used 54 models ranging in age
from 19 to 57, accompanied by such runway queens as Naomi Campbell
and Eva Herzigova.</TE>
<TE>   Gabbana said, "It's all about finding your personality type."</TE>

<HD>Son's Duster May Cost a Fistful of Dollars</HD>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: My son, who is 6-foot-2, wants a duster, a
full-length, unlined raincoat or light coat. Does such a garment
exist? If so, where might we look?</LD>
<LD>   I have a vision of a Clint Eastwood-type coat, one he would have
worn early in his career when he was making westerns.</LD>
<LD>   --SADDLIN' UP TO</LD>
<TE>   GO SHOPPIN'</TE>
<TE>   Dear Saddlin': We found a few dusters that fit your
description--some good, some bad, some ugly, and some will cost you a
fistful of dollars (sorry, we couldn't resist).</TE>
<TE>   The first is from J. Peterman, who was mentioned in this column
just a couple of weeks ago. He started his catalog company with his
famous duster, simply titled the J. Peterman Coat, described as a
"classic horseman's duster [that] protects you, your rump, your
saddle and your legs down to your ankles." Yee haw. It features a
cotton canvas outer shell with a lightweight waterproof nylon lining,
nine pockets, metal snaps and an inner waist drawstring. It's $184
through the catalog or online; go to www.jpeterman.com, or call (888)
647-2555.</TE>
<TE>   Montana's Yellowstone Trail catalog offers a cotton canvas duster
with leather piping and buttons, a wind flap and shoulder cape. But
this one is handmade to order, and you'll pay for it: It's $540. Find
it online at www.mon tanasyt.com, or call (877) 698-7245.</TE>
<TE>   We found an oilskin duster at Adam Leathers Inc. that's made from
a treated cotton canvas that renders it waterproof. Other features
include a double-snap front, detachable cape, nubuck collar and
double-stitched seams. It's $179.98 at www.adamleathers.com, or call
(717) 737-1900.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I'm afraid I already know the answer, but
perhaps you have more creative ideas than I do. Is there any way I
can still get use out of those sort-of-dressy, wide-legged,
just-above-the-knee shorts that were so popular a few years ago? My
legs are my best feature, and I loved wearing the shorts (instead of
skirts or dresses) and didn't even mind having to wear pantyhose with
them. They worked well with jackets and low or mid-heel shoes. I'm
cleaning out my closets and find I've got four pair of these shorts
that still fit and look great. Are they just hopelessly outdated?</TE>
<TE>   --SHORT ON ADVICE</TE>
<TE>   Dear Short: Yes, they are! Honestly, we didn't like those shorts
when they were in, and we sure don't like them now. They're the
female equivalent of men's short-sleeve tailored shirts that look
like the sleeves were chopped off above the elbow. These shorts look
like someone took a pair of tailored pants and hacked them off at the
knees. Add to that some pantyhose and, well, it's not a pretty
picture. Is it casual? Is it formal? It's neither! It's just weird!</TE>
<TE>   However, if those shorts are in a lightweight fabric such as linen
or cotton, it's possible to go from the tailored realm into the
casual realm by wearing them with informal tops such as cotton
T-shirts, sweaters and linen tunics. For shoes, stick with flats or
sandals, and no pantyhose. For places like the office, we'd prefer
you show off your stunning gams in skirts that are knee-length or
fall just above the knee.</TE>
<TE>   For spring and summer, shorts will be loose and range in length
from upper thigh to above the knee, in fabrics from denim to linen to
cotton twill. If you want a more tailored look there are pleated
shorts; less-tailored styles feature drawstring waists, elastic
waists and flat fronts with waistbands that fall just below the
bellybutton.</TE>

<HD>The Key on the Collar</HD>
<DH>Part 5 The story so far: The lost dog with a mysterious key
on his collar has smelled something familiar in the village. He must
go on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH VAN STEENWYK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dog looked from left to right. No one strolled the streets yet.
But he knew someone special had been here. He hurried to the corner
and looked up and down that street.</LD>
<LD>   There, just turning a corner ahead, was a boy on a bicycle. Yes!
He knew that bike. He ran fast. Faster. But he couldn't catch up. The
rider slowed down at the intersection. Then he turned left.</LD>
<LD>   The street led to a neighborhood with small houses and large
trees. He knew those houses. He knew those trees. The dog began to
pant hard as he ran, keeping his eyes on the bicycle. Then it turned
a corner, and by the time he reached it, the boy and bike had
disappeared.</LD>
<TE>   But it didn't matter. Now he knew where he was.</TE>
<TE>   The dog barked and barked as he ran down the street and turned
into a familiar driveway.</TE>
<TE>   "Pepper!" Joey yelled. He was just getting off his bicycle. "You
found us!" He ran to the dog and they hugged each other hard.</TE>
<TE>   Joey's mom and dad and sister hurried out of the house. The door
slammed behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought you were lost on our camping trip," his sister said.
"Lost forever."</TE>
<TE>   "He's been traveling hard," Dad said. "Let's go inside and fix his
paws."</TE>
<TE>   "Guess we'll have to use his key then," Mom said. "The wind
slammed the door shut and now we're locked out."</TE>
<TE>   Joey took off Pepper's collar and unlocked the back door with the
key.</TE>
<TE>   "That spare key was meant for us to use in an emergency," Dad
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Pepper arrived just in time." Joey said. "I wish he could tell us
where he's been."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad he's here," Carolyn said. "And I think he's glad,
too."</TE>
<TE>   As Pepper barked, the key on his collar clinked and clinked and
clinked.</TE>
<TE>   He was really happy to be home again.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Van Steenwyk's dog, Freckles, wore the back door key on
his collar for years, helping his family through several emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.
A new five-part story begins Monday.</TE>

<HD>Enron: A Scandal So Good That It Hurts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"This just keeps getting better and better," Liisa sputters. By that,
my wife means worse and worse. Which is what we're all thinking,
isn't it?</LD>
<LD>   Before dawn, we are up and tearing into the newspapers at my
household. This is terrific, heart-racing stuff.</LD>
<LD>   "Look, Enron paid no income taxes four out of five years!"</LD>
<TE>   "Forget Enron, Andersen is being paid by the Justice Department to
reorganize the FBI!"</TE>
<TE>   "Get this: Enron had 881 offshore subsidiaries!"</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, a professor who became a New York Times editorial columnist
was paid $50,000 as an Enron advisor!"</TE>
<TE>   We're trying not to talk over each other. I'm scribbling notes all
over the paper and Liisa is warning me not to make the story
illegible. We subscribe to four newspapers. Suddenly it's not enough.</TE>
<TE>   This is the juiciest scandal of our lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because this is not about personal indiscretion, not about
sleazy partisan politics, not about runaway foreign policy, not about
"gotcha."</TE>
<TE>   This rotten barrel of apples is all encompassing. Down at the
bottom, in the really contaminated slime, Enron/Andersen/et al. is
about what we have allowed our nation to become.</TE>
<TE>   It's about us. It's about winning at any price--not just winning
but trouncing--about seeing what you can get away with. It's about
greed and the glorification of greed. It's also the football player
who deliberately tries to injure his opponent. It's about parents who
beat each other up at their kids' sports matches. It's about the
hand-to-hand combat of getting your children into the best colleges
so they will be the dog that eats instead of the dog that gets eaten.
It's about the ugly edge that has crept into our language, so that
words such as "intimidation" become virtuous and "honor" a quaint
laughingstock. It's about the blue-ribbon professor-cum-economics
columnist who acknowledges taking $50,000 from Enron for serving on
"a panel that had no function that I was aware of."</TE>
<TE>   Awhile back, we lost sight of the principle that hard work,
diligence and some luck made the man.</TE>
<TE>   Inexplicably, we veered from the root ideal of civil in
civilization. We took what we could and called it ours. We created
the lottery for the instant chance at more. We demanded that every
business "grow" rather than serve--which sounds a lot less benign
than it became, as we watched ourselves transformed into jackals
feeding from our own wounds. We watched as our political system was
co-opted for pennies by wheeler-dealers who hollowed out the laws
with fancy regulations and hidden legislative favors until our
vaunted democracy became the instrument of our own oppression.</TE>
<TE>   We saw simple and honest things devalued. Like the passbook
savings account. And employee loyalty--or loyalty of any kind, for
that matter.</TE>
<TE>   You could wish you were high-minded in this age, but weren't you
looking for 25% gains on your retirement holdings too? It didn't
matter if a company made something, only if it made something happen.
It mattered less whether a deed was right than whether you were "in"
or "out."</TE>
<TE>   Where is the smoking gun?</TE>
<TE>   It's in our hands.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, George W. Bush is culpable: This freight train crashed on his
watch. These were his back-slapping buddies. These are the people he
entrusted with government. This is the way-of-life philosophy he
championed.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not forget that just a few weeks ago he denounced Democrats
for stalling on a multimillion-dollar, retroactive tax break for
Enron and other giant companies.</TE>
<TE>   Let's remember that his top economics advisor, a former Enron
retainer, views the collapse of the company as "a triumph for
capitalism." Let's not overlook that his Treasury secretary sees
Enron as evidence of the "genius of capitalism." Let's not overlook
that his choice to run the GOP has decided to stay on the payroll of
a law firm retained by Enron and reserves the right to moonlight as a
strategic advisor for the company.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush didn't create the scandal. It's been in the works for
years. He's no more guilty than the people who voted for him, or for
those many millions who were suckered into this vision of a cutthroat
America where values--that shopworn word--mean nothing at all when
measured against the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps all boats float on a rising tide. But reach down. Tastes
like sewer water now, doesn't it?</TE>
<TE>   I can hardly wait for tomorrow's papers. This is a terrific time.
Maybe, finally, at long bloody last, things will get bad enough to
make them right.</TE>

<HD>Airbrushing History With Divisiveness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a professor of law at George
Washington University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was an image that flashed across the world and became America's
answer to those who would destroy us: Three New York
firefighters--Dan McWilliams, George Johnson and Billy
Eisengrein--raising an American flag over the smoking remains of the
World Trade Center. Reminiscent of the flag-raising over Mt.
Suribachi at Iwo Jima, the photo's power was due entirely to the fact
that it was spontaneous and honest.</LD>
<LD>   We discovered this week, however, that the photograph--taken by
Thomas E. Franklin of the Record newspaper in Hackensack, N.J.--was
not perfect. It seems that all three firefighters are white. With a
memorial planned to recreate the historic moment, New York officials
decided that the flag could remain, but the firefighters had to go.
Two of the firefighters were to be replaced in the memorial sculpture
with African American and Latino figures.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the well-intentioned effort to reflect the array of races
among these heroes, the change in the memorial succeeded in injecting
race into a moment that had transcended such divisions. There is now
an angry controversy in New York over the memorial design.</LD>
<TE>   While officials easily could allow an accurate depiction combined
with a more diverse background mural, they have steadfastly defended
the decision to alter the firefighters, as has the Vulcan Society, an
organization of African American firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   New York is finally returning to normalcy. After a period of
inspiring unity and courage, various groups have stepped forward to
remind citizens that they should resume class and racial tensions.
One such group is the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense
and Education Fund, which has launched a campaign to receive some of
the federal rebuilding funds. NOW also has released a videotape that
condemns the fact that media coverage did not single out female
firefighters. In the video, Fire Lt. Brenda Berkman is shown
complaining that women firefighters were "totally ignored"--by which
she apparently means that the media failed to distinguish among
heroes by gender.</TE>
<TE>   The very power of the image of the heroes of ground zero has drawn
those who would reshape it in their own image. The gender and racial
blindness that prevailed after the attacks apparently threatened some
groups with obsolescence. Faced with a diverse group of heroes,
ground zero had to be mined for aggrieved heroes who would carry a
banner of division.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the re-creation of history has long been an
irresistible temptation. One of the most famous photographs of World
War II--of Soviet soldiers hoisting the Red flag over the burned-out
Reichstag in Berlin--was taken by Yevgeny Khaldei. In reality, the
photograph was staged. After seeing Associated Press photographer Joe
Rosenthal's Iwo Jima picture, Khaldei tried to create a similar
scene, shooting the soldiers from various poses. Since the battle was
over, he added columns of smoke in the background. He also removed
wristwatches that appear on the arms of one of the soldiers, evidence
of looting after the fall of Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Iwo Jima photograph is not what is seemed. The actual
flag that was first raised was a relatively small one, hoisted by
Marines on a piece of old pipe found on the island. Rosenthal took a
picture later of a much larger flag that cut a more inspiring image
and became the basis for our memorial.</TE>
<TE>   While all memorials can be viewed as interpretive, some are tied
so closely to an event that artistic interpretation can constitute
historical revision. The original picture of the Sept. 11
firefighters was honest and genuine, something that is often missing
in today's manipulated and packaged society. Of course, most
Americans did not see three white men in the original picture but
three heroes. If this flag had been raised by three women or three
African Americans, all firefighters would still be represented.</TE>
<TE>   We now have a choice. We can reinstall the "corrective" lens of
the politics of division. Or we can insist on seeing this profound
event through our own eyes, remembering a transcendent moment in
which a simple and spontaneous act by three firefighters lifted a
nation above the twisted wreckage of ground zero.</TE>

<CX>   Turley commentary-In Jonathan Turley's Friday commentary, he said
the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund was trying to receive federal
money earmarked for Sept. 11 recovery. Actually, it is trying to direct
the federal money to women. Also, the group's name is not the National
Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund.</CX>

<CX>   Female firefighters-In a Jan. 18 commentary by Jonathan Turley, a
New York firefighter, Lt. Brenda Berkman, is quoted criticizing the fact
that the work of female firefighters was not specifically noted in
coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks and thus 'totally ignored' by the media.
This statement was made by Berkman at a screening of the film 'Women at
Ground Zero' and not in the film itself.</CX>

<HD>State GOP Must Focus on the Endgame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL WHALEN</AU>
<BD>Bill Whalen, a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover
Institution, worked on Richard Riordan's gubernatorial exploratory
committee in 2001.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With only six weeks to go until the California primary, the race to
decide the Republican challenger to Gov. Gray Davis has kicked into
high gear. Rudy Giuliani visited Southern California on Thursday to
endorse Bill Simon Jr. The three GOP candidates--Simon, California
Secretary of State Bill Jones and former L.A. Mayor Richard
Riordan--meet Tuesday in San Jose for the first of three debates.</LD>
<LD>   The question facing these candidates is whether they will take the
high road to primary day. Will they take an honest, reflective look
at California's myriad problems, or will they test what little
patience Californians have left for political infighting and
backbiting? Will they appeal to the greater good of California or to
a narrow-minded constituency?</LD>
<LD>   These are timely questions. Suppose there had not been an attack
on the World Trade Center and Giuliani had retired from office, only
to pull a "Hillary": moving to California and running for governor.
Let's not forget that before the events of Sept. 11, Giuliani was a
lame duck with a 40% approval rating, a messy divorce and an
uncertain future.</LD>
<TE>   How would conservative activists receive Time's "Person of the
Year"? They likely would attack him for being pro-choice. They
probably would lampoon his lifestyle, as the decidedly heterosexual
Giuliani, estranged from his wife, shared an apartment with a
same-sex couple in the final months of his administration. They would
vilify him for choosing the liberal icon Mario Cuomo over Republican
George Pataki in the 1994 New York governor's race. And Democrats
would pile it on by questioning whether Giuliani, a prostate cancer
survivor, is fit for office.</TE>
<TE>   We can speculate that this might occur because all of it already
has, at Riordan's expense. Los Angeles' former mayor is the West
Coast version of Giuliani: pro-choice, pro-gay rights, a supporter of
Democratic candidates and a prostate cancer survivor to boot. He's
the bull's-eye in this primary because he's the front-runner and
because his moderate stances offend others' sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   This is why California Republicans fail miserably in elections,
and what must comfort Davis even while his popularity sags. The party
out of power, with 1.7 million fewer registered voters, has to reach
beyond party lines to build winning coalitions. That means adding
moderates and independents to the conservative base.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the most vocal of party faithful obsess over "purity" and
what constitutes a "true" Republican. Such debates are nonproductive.
Riordan is not considered a true Republican because he has donated
money to Davis. Yet Republicans now hail Giuliani even though he was
pro-Cuomo. Does this mean Giuliani gets a pass because he's a
cultural icon?</TE>
<TE>   Among Republicans, is there a statute of limitations on past
transgressions? It's murky. Then again, so are the choices in this
primary. Riordan has donated to Democrats. So has Simon. Jones dumped
George W. Bush for John McCain. Two of the three candidates will be
sacrificed in the primary, but none is as pure as conservatives would
like.</TE>
<TE>   Is Riordan the best choice for Republicans? Maybe, maybe not. But
if California Republicans are serious about regaining power, they'd
do well to make that decision based on the man's record as mayor and
what he aims to do in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for the three candidates, six weeks leaves plenty of
time to break old habits. Why not a primary in which they talk about
spending priorities, getting California back on the right track and
how the next governor can heal a state that's socially divided?</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like the near-impossible--like a job for ... Giuliani.</TE>

<HD>Recalling a Milestone Moment</HD>
<DH>LeVar Burton joins tributes to the historic miniseries
'Roots,' which set the then-unknown actor on a heady path to success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A USC theater department student sits alone in a friend's apartment,
engrossed in the premiere of the ABC miniseries "Roots: The Saga of
an American Family." The 19-year-old is excited that the TV
adaptation of Alex Haley's epic bestseller is finally on the air. He
hopes others are watching but isn't sure if they are.</LD>
<LD>   The following day, the student visits his mother in Sacramento,
and they and friends watch the second installment of "Roots," which
chronicles how Kunta Kinte, the young African captured by white
traders and transported to America, was sold into slavery.</LD>
<LD>   It's not until the next day, Jan. 25, 1977, that the student
realizes others had indeed seen "Roots"--an awareness that comes at
the same time he realizes that his life has changed.</LD>
<TE>   "This crowd started gathering around me [in a supermarket],
pointing at me, saying, 'Hey, you're Kunta Kinte,'" recalled LeVar
Burton last week, sitting in the offices of his Eagle Nation
production company on the Paramount Pictures lot. "It got to a point
where my presence was causing a disturbance in the market. I had no
idea that anybody had been watching. But it just was the beginning.
Soon I found myself in the center of the eye of the hurricane."</TE>
<TE>   With his wide smile and slim build, Burton, now 45, doesn't appear
far removed physically from the novice actor who made his
professional debut as the young Kunta Kinte in "Roots," the landmark
television event, which is marking its 25th anniversary during the
next several days. The drama gripped the country in a fashion that no
other entertainment program had done before, making history as the
highest-rated television program ever at that time.</TE>
<TE>   Burton's defiant expression while shackled in chains became one of
the most searing images from the miniseries, which traced Haley's
ancestry back to Kinte in Africa and through the slaves of the
American South.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Burton is being thrust back into the spotlight as a
flurry of activities marks the anniversary of "Roots." In addition to
a stream of interviews on talk and news shows, he is the host of
tonight's NBC documentary "Roots: Celebrating 25 Years." He also
provided commentary for the just-released DVD "Roots" boxed set from
Warner Home Video. The Hallmark Channel will show the entire original
miniseries starting Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The recent attention surrounding "Roots" has not been daunting to
Burton--certainly not when compared with the first go-round. "It's
not crazy at all," he said. "1977, now that was crazy. The energy was
frenzied and furious. For a 19-year-old to have lived through that is
just incredible. I was totally green. It was a real life lesson. I
truly walked through fire and came out at the end a tempered piece of
steel."</TE>
<TE>   Although "Roots" provided valuable exposure for numerous black
performers, including John Amos, Georg Stanford Brown, Leslie Uggams,
Ben Vereen, Louis Gossett Jr. and O.J. Simpson, Burton, as an
unknown, perhaps used the opportunity most aggressively as a
launching pad for a flourishing career that has branched out in
several directions.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, he is preparing for his 19th season as host and
co-executive producer of the PBS children's television series
"Reading Rainbow," which has earned him seven Emmys. He's reprising
his "Star Trek: The Next Generation" role as the blind Lt. Geordi La
Forge for the latest film version, "Star Trek: Nemesis," now in
production. Burton is also preparing for his directorial feature
debut with "Blizzard," about a talking reindeer, scheduled for
release next holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   Burton developed his directing chops during the last several
years, helming numerous episodes of the "Star Trek" offshoots "The
Next Generation," "Deep Space Nine," Voyager" and the current
"Enterprise," as well as installments of the Showtime series "Soul
Food" and the TV movie "The Tiger Woods Story."</TE>
<TE>   Burton also has written a novel, "Aftermath," and has a small role
in "Ali." Several other film and television projects are in the works
at his Eagle Nations company. In addition, he's enjoying
fatherhood--he has a 7-year-old daughter with wife Stephanie--as well
as grandfatherhood, with a 6-month-old grandson.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is truly, truly great," Burton said, describing his approach
toward projects at this point as "a spiritual journey. I really want
to create a body of work that will make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   And while some other "Roots" cast members have declined to talk
about the anniversary, Burton has joined in celebrating the
miniseries and its influence on him.</TE>
<TE>   "'Roots' deserves all the accolades it receives," he said. "It has
earned its place in the pantheon of the best of the best. And I have
a 25-year body of work that allows me the luxury of reveling in
Kunta. I embrace him as intensely as ever. 'KUNTA' is my license
plate."</TE>
<TE>   During the week that "Roots" aired, theaters and restaurants were
void of patrons. Nightclubs ended shows early. On the final night,
more than half of all homes in the U.S. were tuned to the drama, with
an audience of approximately 77 million. That telecast still ranks as
the third-highest-rated entertainment broadcast in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   David L. Wolper, who produced "Roots" along with the late Stan
Margulies, calls Burton's performance "a miracle. He had never acted
a day in his life, and his first role is on one of the most watched
television programs in history. The audience had to feel sympathy for
him, especially when he's plucked away from his home in Africa. We
really had to have someone who was very likable."</TE>
<TE>   Going from a classroom at USC to working in scenes with such
acclaimed actors as Cicely Tyson and Maya Angelou was a considerable
challenge for Burton. Handling life after "Roots" was another story.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there were roles in films such as "Looking for Mr. Goodbar,"
"Hunter," "Grambling's White Tiger," "Dummy" and others. But there
were other changes for the actor, who had originally planned to go
into the priesthood before deciding on a career in the arts.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, let's just say that because of 'Roots,' I know what it
feels like to be a rock star, and just leave it at that," Burton
said, laughing heartily. "Look, I was 19. I have no apologies for how
I reacted. Am I a better person having gone through that? Absolutely.
A lot of who I am was forged by that experience."</TE>
<TE>   Though he is enjoying the "Roots" retrospective, Burton is
outraged at ABC's decision to pass on the "Roots" documentary, given
its place in the network's history. Questioned by reporters earlier
this week, executives maintained they did not consider the pitch on
the special to be strong enough to warrant buying it. However, ABC's
newly named entertainment president Susan Lyne, who had been in
charge of network movies and specials, said she should have followed
through on plans to commemorate "Roots."</TE>
<TE>   "The century is still young, but I believe in 98 years, ABC's
decision not to air the 'Roots' special will be sure to be one of the
most boneheaded moves of the century," Burton said. "I'm just
flabbergasted by that."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he is not letting the snub get to him. There are too many
positives to consider about the anniversary, Burton said, and about
his career.</TE>
<TE>   "The past 25 years," he said, "have just been preparation for my
next 25."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Roots--Celebrating 25 Years" airs tonight on NBC at 8. The
network has rated the program TV-PG (parental guidance advised).</TE>

<HD>Back to the Basics: 'Italian' Shuns Frills of Filmmaking</HD>
<DH>Director Lone Scherfig is the first woman to make a movie
under Dogma 95's strictures. The result has been popular beyond
anyone's expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"If we had known that the film would sell to so many countries,"
director Lone Scherfig says with an easy laugh, "we would have shot
it on 35-millimeter."</LD>
<LD>   The film of which she speaks, "Italian for Beginners," is an
unexpected hit all over Europe; it opens today in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   It was shot on Beta video, using a hand-held camera and available
light, which no doubt contributed to the rather pasty coloring of her
Nordic actors.</LD>
<TE>   Last February it won a major award at the Berlin Film Festival,
and it's estimated that in Denmark, the film's country of origin, one
in five people has seen it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course Scherfig, speaking through a teleconference connection
from New York, is being tongue in cheek. After all, the handicaps
were deliberate.</TE>
<TE>   Before making the film, she signed the vow of austere filmmaking
rules of Dogma 95, which were drafted in 1995 by four Danish
directors: Thomas Vinterberg ("The Celebration"), Lars von Trier
("The Idiots"), Soren Kragh-Jacobsen ("Mifune") and Kristian Levring
("The King Is Alive").</TE>
<TE>   To them, the focus on the "cosmetics" of filmmaking had become
deadening and the auteur theory just bourgeois romanticism. So they
went back to basics.</TE>
<TE>   This meant hand-held cameras and only natural light, no added
sound, no constructed sets, no special costumes or makeup, and
definitely no million-dollar special effects.</TE>
<TE>   "Dogma was a reaction toward films that are overproduced," says
Scherfig, who has made a television series for Von Trier's production
company, Zentropa.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to challenge the films that have more equipment and
better equipment to tell better stories. It has an element of
provocation and it has a lot of fun in it. We are all very pragmatic
about it. Basically, it's let Hollywood do what Hollywood is very
good at and let's see if we can do something else."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, after Scherfig had finished working on the project
for Zentropa, she was asked if she would be interested in making a
Dogma film, the fifth by a Danish director and the first by a woman.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about it for a few days, a week, and I decided yes,"
says Scherfig, 42. A 20-year veteran of film, television and
advertising, she was ready for a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I could do whatever I wanted to do," she says. "I just
got the money; nobody had to approve of anything. I didn't even have
to stick to Dogma rules."</TE>
<TE>   Although she signed the vow, there is no policing of the rules,
and both Vinterberg and Von Trier have readily admitted to skirting,
if not indeed violating, the rules when necessary. Von Trier said as
much in an interview published on Dogma's official Web site. "We are
now by definition sinners due to the fact that the rules cannot be
kept."</TE>
<TE>   Scherfig chose actors she had worked with, creating roles with
them in mind. .In some cases, she cast against type. Peter Gantzler,
for example, a popular Danish leading man, plays a timid chap with no
faith in his ways with women.</TE>
<TE>   Dogma films are best known for dealing with heavier dramatic
themes. Scherfig's film is much lighter in tone, although it has dark
elements.</TE>
<TE>   In her story, six hapless thirtysomethings are living in a dreary
town outside Copenhagen--"actually the town where the production
company is located," says the director--and begin to awaken to the
possibility of finding their romantic partners.</TE>
<TE>   Sad-eyed Andreas (Anders W. Berthelsen) has arrived to take over
the local church, despite the hostile action of the previous
minister, who seizes every opportunity to denigrate him. Jorgen
Mortensen (Gantzler), a hotel clerk, is too shy to act on the
interest of Giulia (Sara Indrio Jensen), a waitress in the restaurant
run by his best friend, Hal-Finn (Lars Kaalund).</TE>
<TE>   Hal-Finn ignites sparks with hairdresser Karen (Ann Eleonora
Jorgensen) when he arrives for a hair trim. Meanwhile, Olympia
(Anette Stovelbaek), an inept salesclerk at a pastry shop, seems to
be drawn to Andreas. They are further entwined when all six--even
Giulia, who is Italian--start taking the same Italian class in the
evenings.</TE>
<TE>   While the film suggests the light touch of a (low-budget) romantic
comedy, most of the characters are suffering from personal tragedy,
whether induced by circumstance or by character.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas is still grieving from the recent death of his wife,
Olympia lives with an abusive father, Karen must look after a
severely alcoholic mother, Jorgen believes he has become impotent and
Hal-Finn is the rudest restaurateur on Earth and widely hated. Only
Giulia seems untroubled, except for her crush on Jorgen.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's a love film," Scherfig points out, "but it's also
a film about loss and sorrow and solitude and insecurity."</TE>
<TE>   But when "Italian for Beginners" was recently shown in Moscow, she
was criticized for not depicting the "truth," the stated goal of
Dogma films.</TE>
<TE>   "[They said] that six people can't become that happy that easily,"
she recalls. "In a way they're right, but this is a story about
people that can. I wanted to have all of them to be stuck in a
situation and then change their mental curve into a happier
direction. This is a film about problems that you can solve. There
are many you can't. But this is a story about people who can move
their lives in a more positive direction."</TE>
<TE>   Making the film was liberating, Scherfig says, for many reasons.
Her budget was small--around $1 million--so she felt she could risk
experimentation. "Filmmaking is quite anxiety-provoking," she says.
"You spend so much of other people's time and money."</TE>
<TE>   There was also less pressure working with a smaller crew. Without
the need for many "cosmetics," she had a crew of 15, as opposed to 75
for her first feature film, "The Birthday Trip." And she didn't have
to agitate about lighting, sets, costuming or makeup.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some choices that you make at random," she says. "For
instance, all locations were just the nearest places--the nearest
hairdresser, the nearest hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "There were so many choices that I usually have to make that I
didn't have to make, which gave me much more time to work with the
actor and concentrate with the actors and scene. And they're acting
in their own clothes: no makeup, no props."</TE>
<TE>   Although she is usually given to meticulously plotting out her
shots, for this film she accepted improvisation and happenstance.</TE>
<TE>   "It was helpful for me to sign this vow of chastity saying that I
promise to trust the moment rather than the dramaturgy," she says.
"So I didn't feel obliged to be a perfectionist, but just shoot and
improvise and to be open and spontaneous to whatever occurred on the
set, or rather location, since there are no sets."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, occasional ad-libs worked themselves into the script. Or one
day, for example, when Gantzler showed up with a scarf around his
neck, saying that he was too sick to work, Scherfig simply insisted
that he play his character as being sick. For her, it worked, because
the scene added to the character's fussiness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a completely different way of working; it's much more
intuitive," Scherfig observes. "I would not have dared to do that if
I hadn't promised that."</TE>
<TE>   Scherfig says making a Dogma film has helped her move in a more
positive direction. "I felt I finally found my own vision of how I
want to make films," she says.</TE>
<TE>   First, she feels more comfortable about indulging in her penchant
for comedy. And although her next film, "Wilbur Wants to Kill
Himself," is a full-scale 35-millimeter non-Dogma feature with
lighting, costuming and the rest of the baggage, it will mix humor
with descents into the dark side of life. "I use the comedy as a tool
for being serious," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   "The films are never only funny because I take the audience
seriously." "Wilbur," to be shot in Scotland, is about how one man
tries to dissuade his brother from killing himself.</TE>
<TE>   As for shooting style, Scherfig would like to adopt a more relaxed
attitude, being open to incorporating improvisations or happenstance,
a pleasure learned from "Italian for Beginners."</TE>
<TE>   Would she consider making another Dogma film? "Maybe in 10 years,
if I need to sharpen the instrument or find a story good for Dogma,"
she says. "Yes, I think I'll miss it if I don't do it again."</TE>

<HD>'The Fluffer' Finds Honesty and Depth in a Shallow Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Fluffer" begins as the light satire on the gay porn industry its
title suggests, but then develops parallel stories of thwarted love
and ultimately emerges as a coming-of-age odyssey of notable
substance and honesty. That it is a fine example of modest-budget
filmmaking, boasting first-rate acting, writing and directing, is not
all that surprising.</LD>
<LD>   That's because it is co-directed by Richard Glatzer, whose 1994
debut feature "Grief" made hilarious use of his experiences as
producer of "Divorce Court." Glatzer took us into the crazed world of
the writers for a lurid daytime courtroom TV show yet took his people
seriously amid much laughter. By the same token, "The Fluffer's"
writer and co-director, Wash West, researched the world of gay porn
so thoroughly that he ended up making some adult videos himself.</LD>
<LD>   The film's protagonist, Sean (Michael Cunio), arrives in Hollywood
determined to break into the film industry, much like countless other
film students before him.</LD>
<TE>   However, in an era of runaway production, veterans as well as
newcomers are taking crew jobs on porn productions to pay the rent or
gain experience. An attractive enough twentysomething gay man, Sean
gets a job at Men of Janus Productions, ostensibly as a video
cameraman, but he is expected to do anything he's told to--including
acting as a "fluffer" for the company's mega-star, Johnny Rebel
(Scott Gurney), physically getting him into the mood to perform for
the camera.</TE>
<TE>   The naive Sean is taken aback because the porn star has long been
the man of his dreams. Sean instantly falls for Johnny, who possesses
a magnificent physique, strong-jawed handsomeness and an easygoing
personality.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, Johnny's popularity has peaked, he's into drugs and his
longtime relationship with a beautiful aspiring actress, Julie
(Roxanne Day), who works at a Reseda strip club, is becoming
increasingly strained under the pressure of both partners working in
the sex industry.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny, whose real name is Mikey, is one of many so-called
"gay-for-pay" porn stars who make gay pictures because they pay men
better than straight porn does. Mikey is a nice guy who has traded
solely on his looks, and while they haven't as yet deteriorated, he
has never developed any apparent skills outside sex and is
understandably terrified about his waning popularity. Drugs are
making him unreliable and paranoid, and he sees hustling as his only
alternative.</TE>
<TE>   As Mikey begins his downward spiral, Julie, whose nom de strip is
Babylon, is forced to reassess their relationship, despite their
underlying mutual love and her none-too-successful bid to become a
working actress.</TE>
<TE>   Through the unsparing way in which the stories of these three
young people play out, Sean is confronted with his lack of
self-acceptance as a gay man stemming from his traumatic introduction
to sex as a child. Of the three, Mikey, for all his muscles and
Greek-god looks, is the most vulnerable, the most likely to lose his
way. He's not stupid by any means, but neither is he very perceptive
or capable of the same honest self-appraisal as Julie and Sean. It's
possible that there is a degree of confusion in his sexual
orientation that he may never be prepared to examine.</TE>
<TE>   Gurney is so aptly cast as the man of a zillion sexual fantasies
that it may be easy to overlook his insightful portrayal of the
conflicted, constitutionally immature Mikey.</TE>
<TE>   Gurney is a talented actor, not a hunk who's been cast merely for
his appearance. Day is so lovely and gifted that she deserves the
breaks that have eluded Julie, and Cunio is appealing as a young man
attempting to find his way through the painful throes of
self-discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Glatzer and West have surrounded their young actors with an array
of familiar, always-impressive veterans, and Robert Walden, Taylor
Negron, Richard Riehle and Tim Bagley are the humorous but tough
seen-it-all types who run Men of Janus. Adina Porter is their
secretary, the wry Silver, the film's true realist who warns Sean
that when it comes to desire, "it's the distance that gets you
hooked."</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Harry is spot-on as the shrewd but compassionate manager
of the strip club where Julie works. Josh Holland is a personable
young photographer attracted to Sean, to little avail. Among other
stalwarts are Mickey Cottrell and Guinevere Turner.</TE>
<TE>   While the film depicts little sex, straight or gay, it has
appearances by many notables of the porn industry, among them
director Chi Chi La Rue and stars Ron Jeremy and Cole Tucker.</TE>
<TE>   As character-driven as "The Fluffer" is, it unfolds in a graceful,
easy flow, thanks to the skills of cinematographer Mark Putnam and
editor John Binninger. Although "The Fluffer's" most obvious appeal
is to gay men, its perspective transcends sexual orientation.</TE>

<HD>Gossip, Rumors: Calling All Media</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a hot tip for the National Enquirer, the Sun, the Globe and
the Star: I screened A&amp;E's "Gossip: Tabloid Tales" with Elvis Presley
and a two-headed alien with breast implants, after which we cut out
someone's heart and stomped on it.</LD>
<LD>   And about Janet Reno having Mick Jagger's baby ...</LD>
<LD>   Whether guilty pleasures or a blight, tabloids have been spewing
lurid sensationalism in the U.S. for more than two centuries. They
arrived with satin breeches and the Constitution in an age when
newspaper writers called themselves "newsmongers" and slandering
scandal sheets didn't bother labeling opinion.</LD>
<TE>   It's a real hoot here watching more recent juicy and exotic
headlines of tabloids roll by, along with Walter Winchell, Louella
Parsons, Hedda Hopper, Confidential magazine and celebrities battling
paparazzi carnivores. A real hoot, that is, if you weren't one of
their victims.</TE>
<TE>   All fun aside, however, rumor and innuendo in 2002 extend far
deeper into the media abyss than this fringe press and others
mentioned here, including the New York Post, the more proper People
magazine and even the Matt Drudges and similar blowhards of the
Internet who play Russian roulette with hearsay. When mainstream TV
decides to tackle tabloids, however, a medium it inevitably omits is
mainstream TV--the newsmagazines and especially 24-hour news
networks, which too often emblazon speculation, loose talk and other
titillating fare across their marquees.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that the Enquirer led the pack (and as a bonus, broke
some legitimate stories) in frenzied reporting of O.J. Simpson's
criminal trial in 1995 for the killings of his former wife, Nicole
Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman. Gossip columnist Liz Smith correctly
titles this episode "the greatest media overkill" since newspapers
convicted Bruno Hauptmann of murdering Charles Lindbergh's small son
even before the case went to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   But mainstream media, most notably CNN and MSNBC, also fed at that
O.J. trough day after day, week after week, and kept their snouts in
slop all the way through the deaths of Princess Diana and John F.
Kennedy Jr., en route to the escapades of Gary Condit and post-Sept.
11 days of speculating endlessly and often emptily about Osama bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   That is classic tabloid. As is talk radio, where the ranting
ideologues who often command these airwaves inflame and skew issues
to fit their own political and social agendas. Which is exactly what
they accuse other media of doing.</TE>
<TE>   Some locals also wear that tabloid mantle, notably KCOP-TV, which
operates L.A.'s only 10 p.m. newscast scored to music. On one
occasion this week it headlined: "Real live vampires among us,"
giving cause to drive a stake through the brain trust that put this
youth-targeted, format-driven news program on the air.</TE>
<TE>   This being KCOP, the topic was ultimately narrowed to "vampire
sex." That was followed shortly by another "story" featuring a
"mating science expert" and others pondering the sexual meaning of
touching. For slow-witted viewers requiring a visual aid, the
newscast went to a close-up of a hand moving playfully toward a male
erogenous zone.</TE>
<TE>   And in a tabloid-esque hour supported by scary music Wednesday
night, ABC's premiering magazine series "20-20 Downtown" exhumed an
old case about missing young girls, shamelessly pointing a finger,
without evidence, at a man who has denied being involved in those
disappearances and has never been charged by police.</TE>
<TE>   Yet TV and radio are ignored by A&amp;E's mostly soft two-hour
documentary, which more or less winks at the excesses of tabloids
while defining them narrowly, giving their writers and editors a
stage to praise themselves and presenting those profiting from these
papers as arbiters of media ethics.</TE>
<TE>   You'll be gagging, for example, when Bill Clinton's ex-girlfriend
Gennifer Flowers asks rhetorically, "What is fame without dignity?"</TE>
<TE>   Poor baby. In her case, says this documentary from MPH
Entertainment, she peddled her dignity, along with her story, to the
Star for $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the new, improved Monica Lewinsky--now a camera-ready
purse designer seeking out and profiting from the media she once
fled--is being paid in money and publicity by HBO, which showed her
off to visiting TV critics this week to promote its March 3
documentary, "Monica in Black and White." Wanna buy a bag?</TE>
<TE>   Enough of that, however, for neither print nor electronic tabloids
are the ailment most threatening today's media and, by extension,
menacing the entire republic.</TE>
<TE>   Potentially more lethal are ever-increasing corporate mergers that
eat away at diversity by consolidating media communications into
fewer and fewer hands, while a pliant Federal Communications
Commission and its chairman, Michael Powell, give a giddy thumbs-up
to further loosening ownership rules.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, giants like Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and AOL Time Warner
appear poised to carve up the media planet like Czechoslovakia in
1939.</TE>
<TE>   Just to remind you, though, the buck also stops here. Tribune Co.,
which owns this paper, also owns bozo-ridden KTLA. Now did I write
"bozo-ridden" to demonstrate my independence, or because I meant it?</TE>
<TE>   Tribune also owns a chunk of the WB network, whose just-premiered
shows "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy Experiment" and "Glory Days" I gave
positive reviews. Because I truly liked them, or because blood is
thicker than integrity?</TE>
<TE>   You see the problem. Whatever my answer, you have reason to doubt
it.</TE>
<TE>   And by the way, this incestuous web is growing ever more elaborate
with revenue-hungry entertainment networks now again welcoming
programs created by corporate sponsors--a terrible idea--that hope to
resume the creative control they had in TV's infancy.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Hallmark Cards' "Hall of Fame" is one TV franchise
whose generally impressive resume has not been tainted by hands-on
involvement by its parent company. Yet having sponsors directly
involved in the creative process is fraught with as much peril as
corporate big shots nosing into the editorial process.</TE>
<TE>   A similar link is already in place in sports, where corporate
underwriters have been deploying college football bowl games as their
logos (the Culligan Holiday, galleryfurniture.com, GMAC, Sylvania
Alamo, Tostitos Fiesta, FedEx Orange, Nokia Sugar and Wells Fargo Sun
bowls, for example). And we may be only a step from the Hoover Cleans
Carpets Better Than Other Vacuums Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Here's something potentially more troublesome, though.</TE>
<TE>   If this paper's corporate sibling, the WB, does follow through on
announced plans for a prime-time program in March created by Ford
Motor Co. to showcase its line of SUVs, won't that, in effect, make
Times employees who cover TV Ford's quasi-partners? If we write nice
things about the show, will readers wonder if there are Fords in our
futures?</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, what is a new car without dignity?</TE>

<HD>Welcome Comfort in 'Fiddler on the Roof'</HD>
<DH>Veteran Theodore Bikel, songs many fans cherish and
old-fashioned stagecraft more than make up for the touring show's few
frayed edges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expectant applause greets the first, familiar strains of "Tradition."
Many in the audience know the song by heart, as well as Tevye the
milkman's coming pronouncement: "Without our traditions, our lives
would be as shaky as a fiddler on the roof."</LD>
<LD>   Few songs speak quite so directly to humankind's yearning for
stability, so the song's return, in a show that is itself a
tradition, is particularly welcome in these troubled times.</LD>
<LD>   That show is "Fiddler on the Roof," which is passing through Los
Angeles in a touring production that essentially re-creates the
original 1964 Broadway staging and features one of the world's most
familiar Tevyes: Theodore Bikel.</LD>
<TE>   It plays at the Wilshire Theatre through Jan. 27.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of less-than-perfect singing voices aside, this is a
well-cast production. And although a few uncertain or uninspired
moments make the enterprise seem frayed about the edges, the show is
otherwise solidly staged, delivering warmth and comfort in all the
expected places.</TE>
<TE>   Even the old-fashioned stagecraft--with the performers pushing
Tevye's ramshackle house into place on rollers--is a refreshing
throwback to the days before the dehumanized slickness of computer
controls.</TE>
<TE>   Based on stories by Sholom Aleichem, "Fiddler"--with a book by
Joseph Stein, music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon
Harnick--tells the story of a Russian village shaken by change in
1905, as pogroms send Jewish residents fleeing for their lives. The
story's Everyman is the hard-working Tevye, who talks with God as
though they were two old friends walking the streets together, and
whose earthly treasures are his no-nonsense wife and his five radiant
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Change begins at home for Tevye as, one by one, his daughters find
a way around traditional arranged marriages. The "Tradition" melody
tries to reassert itself each time, but there's no avoiding the
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Bikel, who has logged more than 1,800 performances as Tevye,
brings nice shadings to the role. True, he is too old-looking for the
part, with his snowy-white hair and beard. And, now that he's in his
late 70s, he moves a bit stiffly. Yet his deep, rich voice projects
each song like cantorial prayer, and he infuses Tevye with just the
right balance of reverence and Borscht Belt humor.</TE>
<TE>   The daughters who upend his life are also well cast, with Eileen
Tepper, Sara Schmidt and Rachel Jones each bringing vitality and a
sweet, fluttering singing voice to the respective roles of Tzeitel,
Chava and Hodel. The diminutive Maureen Silliman lends a lean
efficiency to Golde, Tevye's good-natured sparring partner of a wife,
although her singing isn't as flexible or as evocative as her acting.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's impossible to stanch the flow of tears when she and
Bikel sing "Sunrise, Sunset" at Tzeitel's wedding--part of a finely
detailed staging re-created by Sammy Dallas Bayes, who has long been
associated with "Fiddler."</TE>
<TE>   Evoking Jewish folk melodies, the songs--particularly "If I Were a
Rich Man," "Matchmaker, Matchmaker," "Sabbath Prayer," "To Life" and
the heartbreaking "Far From the Home I Love"--pulse with the
resiliency that has sustained a culture through many hard times.</TE>
<TE>   But above all, the show is guided by humankind's truest compass.
"It's a new world," Tevye says to his wife. "A new world. Love."</TE>

<DH>Expecting reporters to be 'nice' may have been the second
mistake for HBO documentary subject Monica Lewinsky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monica Lewinsky wore black. But many of those who went to listen to
her saw only red.</LD>
<LD>   The infamous Washington intern dived back into the media spotlight
on Wednesday during a stormy session with television critics as she
attempted to promote an upcoming HBO documentary about her
involvement in the scandal that nearly brought down the Clinton
administration.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of asking specific questions about the documentary, which
combines archival tape and public record with footage of Lewinsky
answering questions for college students, several reporters pressed
her on why she has reappeared to call more attention to herself
instead of trying to live a more private life. The atmosphere was
contentious, even hostile.</LD>
<TE>   One of the tenser moments came when one reporter posed this
question: "If a professor had consensual sex with a student, he'd be
out of there in a New York minute. If a cop stopped someone and they
had consensual sex, he would be fired on the spot. Why do you think
we did not hold our president to the same moral standard we expect of
others?"</TE>
<TE>   Lewinsky seemed thrown by the question and had difficulty
responding. She started dabbing at her eyes with her fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the principal misconceptions she's trying to
straighten out with the documentary, Lewinsky replied, "That I sought
this celebrity by seducing the president and going to the White House
with an agenda and then turning on him so that all of this could
happen, so that I could enjoy it, so that I then could cause trouble
for the country and then make millions and millions of dollars, and
then continue to perpetuate that celebrity, and enjoy and make the
most of it.</TE>
<TE>   "And that I'm stupid!"</TE>
<TE>   Lewinsky, flanked by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, the
producers and writers of "Monica in Black and White," was visibly
nervous during the session, which took place in front of a
standing-room-only audience at the Pasadena Ritz-Carlton Hotel. She
was often halting and awkward in her responses.</TE>
<TE>   Said one HBO executive, "It's like they hated her from the moment
she walked in."</TE>
<TE>   And when the producers or Sheila Nevins, executive vice president
of original programming, attempted to flesh out answers or assist
Lewinsky, several reporters, in tones similar to those used by the
Washington press corps, shouted that Lewinsky should be allowed to
fend for herself. "Why the hell is she here, then?" bellowed Gail
Shister of the Philadelphia Inquirer.</TE>
<TE>   Shaken at one point, Lewinsky turned to Nevins and quipped, "I
thought you said they were going to be nice."</TE>
<TE>   Answered Nevins: "They are being nice. You should see them when
they're not nice."</TE>
<TE>   HBO executives after the session debated with some of the
reporters about the propriety of berating Lewinsky when they had not
seen the documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Albrecht, president of original programming for HBO, said in
an interview Friday, "I was surprised by the aggressiveness and what
seemed to be hostility almost from the very beginning. Monica was
there to answer questions without repeating [what she addressed in]
the documentary. She's not a professional public speaker. She came in
a bundle of nerves and quickly became very flustered."</TE>
<TE>   Albrecht added, "Also, here were these professional journalists
asking the same questions that the college students asked."</TE>
<TE>   The Lewinsky session was preceded by a long excerpt from the
documentary, which was filmed in black and white and is scheduled to
premiere March 3 on the pay cable network. Lewinsky was shown
entering the auditorium at New York City's Cooper Union alone and
sitting on the stage to face her audience. .</TE>
<TE>   She tells them that they can ask her anything and that she is no
longer bound by restrictions following the Jan. 22 termination of her
immunity agreement with former independent counsel Kenneth Starr. A
note at the beginning of the clip explained that she was paid for her
participation.</TE>
<TE>   Following the clip, Lewinsky, dressed in a black leather coat,
cream-colored blouse and knee-length black leather skirt, took the
stage with the producers, to tepid applause. Lewinsky explained that
she had wanted to participate in the project because she had heard
that there were several movies in the works about the scandal and she
was concerned about inaccuracies.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to clearing up misconceptions about her and her
involvement in the scandal, Lewinsky said she had also wanted to
address other issues, such as the right to privacy and the
"misguided, prosecutorial zeal, abuse of power and so on."</TE>
<TE>   She said, "In thinking about all this, I really realized that when
you're forced to remain silent while you're in the center of this
legal, political, media cyclone, you realize very painfully that a
vacuum is created. And to be filled, I guess, by people who have
their own agenda, or others who hare misinformed about the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Lewinsky added that she is still designing handbags and taking
classes at Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how much she was paid for the project, she smiled and
said, "Not enough to quit my day job."</TE>

<LD>   Overflow Crowd at 'Price Is Right' Special</LD>
<LD>   The 30th anniversary celebration of CBS' "The Price Is Right"
didn't go quite the way that producer and host Bob Barker intended
Thursday. An estimated 5,000 people showed up for the taping of a
prime-time special at Las Vegas' Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino--but
only 900 tickets were available.</LD>
<TE>   "We got a call about 8:15 a.m. They ran out of tickets and people
started yelling," Vincent Cannito, a spokesman for the Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department, told The Times. "We held over our
graveyard [shift] officers and sent our day-shift patrols out a
little early, but no one did anything destructive."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "These weren't bad people, by any stretch--just tired,
agitated people who stood in line. The show obviously has quite a
following."</TE>
<TE>   Though no arrests were made, one man was taken to the hospital and
treated for minor head injuries as a result of pushing and shoving.</TE>

<TE>   Comedy Central Cranks Out New Shows</TE>
<TE>   Comedy Central announced several new original programs Thursday,
including "Crank Yankers," from the creators of the cable network's
series "The Man Show." Debuting in June, "Crank Yankers" will feature
crank phone calls acted out by a town inhabited by puppets.</TE>
<TE>   The network also announced that a five-part documentary series,
"The Heroes of Black Comedy," including pieces on Richard Pryor and
Chris Rock, will air in February.</TE>

<TE>   Firefighters Monument Runs Into Flak</TE>
<TE>   A proposed monument to firefighters who died in the World Trade
Center attack has drawn heat in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-foot-tall, $180,000 sculpture, to be installed in front of
Fire Department headquarters in the spring, is based on a well-known
news photograph showing three firefighters raising the American flag
at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   In the original shot, taken by Thomas E. Franklin for New Jersey's
Bergen Record, all were white. In the proposed monument, to be
created by a Brooklyn atelier called StudioEIS, one will be white,
another Latino and the third African American.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say it's a case of excessive political correctness. They
also question why it was done in such a rush without a design
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce C. Ratner, president of Forest City Ratner, the developer of
the Brooklyn complex where the firefighters headquarters is based,
said in a statement that race and ethnicity played no part in the
deeds of Sept. 11 and that "it does a disservice to the memory of the
thousands lost on that day to raise such issues now."</TE>
<TE>   Rhona Bronson, spokeswoman for the Record, told the Boston Globe
that a licensing contract with Ratner was never completed. Because
"the photo is an important piece of photojournalism and documents an
historical moment, it shouldn't be altered," she maintained.</TE>

<TE>   Silver Lake Artist Back in Business</TE>
<TE>   Van Freeman, the Silver Lake man whose decorated house became a
haunt of folk-art admirers after his sudden disappearance in
September and a Times article in November, is back in town, making
art and keeping regular gallery hours.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, a former shoe repairman who assembles found materials
including glass bits, shattered tiles and wood, alarmed neighbors
with his odd hours and frenetic work habits. Then he suddenly left
town after falling nearly $4,000 behind in his rent.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Marilyn Downey led a neighborhood campaign to preserve
the biblically themed artworks he left behind and cover rent
payments. After Freeman turned up at his parents' home in Baltimore
and gave his assent, Downey opened the home to visitors. In December,
Freeman returned to Los Angeles and auctioned off several works.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is again a resident at 2911 Reservoir St., and with the aid
of neighbor Downey has mended fences with landlord Dick Padron.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said he plans to keep the bungalow open, making art in
back and exhibiting in front, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Mondays,
Wednesdays and Saturdays. Other visiting hours can be arranged by
appointment at (323) 669-1312.</TE>

<HD>Race for the Oscars Produces Ad Frenzy</HD>
<DH>With no front-runners for Academy Awards, studios are
breaking out marketing checkbooks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With no clear front-runner for best picture or in other major
categories, the Oscars are a true horse race this year. So an
unusually large field of film companies with strong contenders are
spending conspicuously for ads in the trade papers Variety and the
Hollywood Reporter as well as in consumer publications, mainly the
Los Angeles Times and the New York Times, the two cities in which the
highest percentage of academy voters live and work.</LD>
<LD>   Intensifying the ad blitz is the fact that many of the strongest
contenders were released in the last few weeks of 2001 and are in
general release right now, making the contest more heated than usual
as studios jockey for better placement in publications to attract
moviegoers and focus academy voter attention at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   Movies that were released more than six months ago ("Moulin
Rouge," "Shrek") must clamor for recognition amid a pack of newer
films still benefiting from their normal publicity campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   Miramax, one of the most savvy Oscar competitors, is going
further, buying TV spots for older films such as "The Others," whose
ads tout Nicole Kidman's lead performance. Studios almost never buy
television ads for movies that are not in general release. In
addition, Miramax purchased time on local TV and cable stations to
present studio documentaries about six of their Oscar-potential
films, "Amelie," "The Others," "The Shipping News," "In the Bedroom,"
"Iris," and "Bridget Jones's Diary."</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, it is taking an almost unprecedented step,
sneak-previewing the Italian entry for the foreign-language Oscar,
"The Son's Room." (Companies generally preview only English-language
films due for imminent national release.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wide-open year and anything is possible," says David
Brooks, Miramax's co-head of marketing. "This year we have more
movies to support and other [studios] are really going for it, so we
have to be competitive and make sure we don't get lost in the
shuffle."</TE>
<TE>   Even having only one film in contention doesn't guarantee that a
film company can stint on advertising. DreamWorks, which has won the
last two best picture races ("American Beauty" and "Gladiator"), has
been splashily promoting "Shrek," which is already well into its
video and DVD release. Like "Gladiator," it debuted in the early part
of 2001. Terry Press, DreamWorks' head of marketing, says she has to
remind Oscar voters that "Shrek" was a 2001 release and educate them
that the film is eligible both for this year's new animation Oscar
and other categories including best picture.</TE>
<TE>   What she didn't count on was having to shout above the din of so
many competing films. "Even the 'shoo-ins' are buying huge ads,"
Press says. "It's mind-boggling."</TE>
<TE>   The Christmas-in-January aspect (as one studio marketing head
described it) of this year's Oscar ad push is heaviest in the days
following the academy members' receipt of Oscar ballots, which were
mailed Jan. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Since all members of the academy can nominate a best picture and
the biggest bloc of voters--the acting branch--selects the 20
performances in four categories, the next few weeks are the
filmmakers' best chance to be in the running when the nominations are
announced Feb. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time when everyone feels they have to make their
statements, because 60% to 70% of the ballots are usually mailed back
in the first week," says Russell Schwartz, head of marketing at New
Line Cinema, which is touting "Lord of the Rings" and the drama "I Am
Sam," starring Sean Penn.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one would discuss dollar amounts, one veteran Oscar
campaigner says that companies with viable best picture nominees may
end up shelling out somewhere between $10 million and $15 million by
the time Academy Awards season draws to a close.</TE>
<TE>   There hasn't been such intensity surrounding the Oscars since the
best picture fight-to-the-finish between Miramax's "Shakespeare in
Love" and DreamWorks' "Saving Private Ryan" three years ago,
according to Variety publisher Charles Koons. "It's been a very
healthy year for us as it is any time there's no clear front-runner
like a 'Titanic,'" he says.</TE>
<TE>   Over at the Hollywood Reporter, associate publisher Lynn Segall
says the increase for that publication may be as much as 25% to 30%
over last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more movies in the mix this year," Segall says. "Even
smaller movies like 'Memento' want to be players and are coming to us
with [ad] schedules."</TE>
<TE>   Also, adds Segall, after Jan. 1, when the critics chime in and the
Golden Globe nominations have been announced, some studios cut back
on films that appear to have lost momentum. This year, however, there
has been no critical consensus around any film, so there hasn't been
the usual January drop-off in ads.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Except for mailings of eligible films on videocassette and DVD,
the academy bars movie companies from sending out promotional
materials. Screenings and personal appearances for guild
organizations (directors, writers, actors and others) are still
allowed. Trying to reach voters through consumer outlets has become
the only other viable alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Jyll Holzman, the New York Times' senior vice president for
advertising, said the awards season has resulted in "extremely robust
advertising" by the film industry in that paper. David Garcia,
director of media relations for the Los Angeles Times, said, "We've
seen a noticeable increase in movie-related advertising. The
diversity of film subjects competing this awards season may be one
reason for this increase."</TE>
<TE>   The supplementary advertising in consumer publications and
television is for insurance, Revolution Studios senior executive Tom
Sherak says. "The studios and independent companies spend a fortune
in the trades, but they're not read by everybody. When they figure
out their academy campaign, part of it is now geared to [consumer]
newspapers as well."</TE>
<TE>   Revolution's "Black Hawk Down" is one of the year-end releases
seen as having a shot at best picture. But as with Universal, which
has a likely nominee in "A Beautiful Mind," there's constant pressure
to maintain a high profile. "There's no question you must always
remain competitive," says Universal marketing head Peter Adee. "If
that means I have to buy more consumer and trade ads, we'll do it. We
can't afford the appearance of not being in the game."</TE>
<TE>   For major studios with deep pockets or smaller companies allied
with studios (such as New Line Cinema, a division of AOL Time
Warner), the one-upmanship spending can be absorbed. For a true
independent such as Lions Gate, it's more problematic. Lions Gate is
offering the year-end releases "Monster's Ball," starring Billy Bob
Thornton and Halle Berry, and the Australian film "Lantana," starring
Anthony LaPaglia. Says Tom Ortenberg, Lions Gate president, "We have
to walk a fine line between promoting our films for award contention
and spending our way into losses."</TE>

<HD>Store Design May Be Bold, but It Doesn't Fit Quite Right</HD>
<DH>Rem Koolhaas' concept for a Prada showroom tends toward
gestures that are over the top.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES ARCHITECTURE CRITIC</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The opening of a clothing store is rarely a major architectural
event. But the new Prada boutique in SoHo, designed by Dutch
architect Rem Koolhaas, is no normal store.</LD>
<TE>   The project pairs one of the world's most talented architects with
a fashion powerhouse known for making bold creative leaps. Koolhaas'
reputation as a radical urban thinker dates to the 1978 publication
of his first book, "Delirious New York." In recent years, he has
landed a string of impressive commissions, including a concert hall
in Porto, Portugal, scheduled for completion in 2003, and a major
redesign for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Wilshire
Boulevard campus. Prada, meanwhile, has invested $40 million in the
New York store, making it one of the most expensive commercial
projects, per square foot, in the city's history.  With such
resources at his disposal, Koolhaas was expected to shake up the
fashion establishment, to reinvent shopping for the 21st century. But
despite a wealth of technological gadgetry, the project lacks both
the conceptual clarity we have come to expect from Koolhaas' firm,
the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, and the elegance associated
with Prada. Worse, the store opens at a time when New York--still
suffering from the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--is
recoiling from gestures of conspicuous consumption. The result comes
off as more self-indulgent than savvy, a relic from a time when
over-the-top opulence was still the norm.</TE>
<TE>   The store occupies a block-long site at the corner of Prince
Street and Broadway that was once occupied by the Guggenheim Museum's
SoHo branch. (The museum has moved into a smaller space next door.)
The entire project is dominated by what Koolhaas calls the Wave--a
concave form that swoops down from just beyond the entry to basement
level and back up again. On one side, the ramp is equipped with rows
of bleacher-like seating; on the other, its smooth, zebra wood
surface evokes a skateboard ramp.</TE>
<TE>   The Wave performs a dual function. During the day, the seating is
used to display shoes. At night, the Wave can be transformed into a
150-seat theater. The shoes are packed away. Opposite, a large
mechanical platform flips down to provide a stage. Koolhaas
originally envisioned the Guggenheim using this space for art events.
But the museum pulled out after Sept. 11, and the space now will be
run by the Prada Foundation, which until now has mostly promoted the
work of contemporary artists.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the store is laid out around this central space. A
large, cylindrical glass elevator stands just to the left of the
entry. To the right, the entire north wall is decorated with exotic
flowered wallpaper. Above, racks of dresses are suspended in
perforated metal cages. Other displays are located at basement level
in a labyrinthine series of compact, windowless rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas conceived of these spaces as a series of titillating,
voyeuristic experiences. The sleek, piston-like elevator functions as
a display cabinet where Prada can show off items such as a $19,000
crocodile duffel bag and self-admiring shoppers can pose for
surrounding crowds. The metal cages, which hold racks of elegant
dresses, look as if they should be inhabited by gyrating go-go
dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Other naughty pleasures include the changing rooms, which are
tucked along a back wall that faces the underbelly of the Wave.
Empty, the changing rooms' glass facades are transparent. Once
inside, shoppers can tap a button and the glass turns opaque, so they
can disrobe in privacy. Tap another button and the glass is
transparent again, allowing those inside the room to model for
friends or other shoppers outside.</TE>
<TE>   At moments like this, Koolhaas seems to be mining new
psychological territory. The armor that fashion can provide is
stripped away, and shopping is reduced to an intimate social act--a
mix of sex, seduction and narcissistic self-display.</TE>
<TE>   At other times, the architect falls back on old art-house cliches.
The lingerie, for example, hangs along a narrow corridor, facing a
series of darkened booths in which a thin, horizontal strip of video
images, set at eye level, depicts Prada fashion shows and clips of
Goddard films interspersed with an occasional blurry sex scene.</TE>
<TE>   Such conceptual slip-ups are relatively easy to correct. But
ultimately the design's failure rests with the Wave. Koolhaas first
raised the idea of using the shop for public activities in 1999,
during a meeting with Guggenheim director Thomas Krens. Linking Prada
to the Guggenheim would give both added cachet, Koolhaas told Krens,
and the Guggenheim needed a new downtown location for art events. Why
not combine the two into a single experience?</TE>
<TE>   In suggesting the collaboration, Koolhaas sought to raise prickly
questions about the nature of art and commerce in American society.
Over the past decade, an increasing number of museums has been
fudging the boundaries between independent scholarship and commerce
to boost box-office revenues. The Guggenheim, in particular, has been
accused of pandering to corporate interests. Its 1999 show "The Art
of the Motorcycle," for example, was sponsored entirely by BMW.</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas' strategy was to push that trend to its logical
conclusion, setting up a tension between two seemingly opposing
worlds. But the truth is that most Americans have become accustomed
to corporate assaults on the public realm. And although Koolhaas'
strategy may have raised a few eyebrows inside the art world, it is
unlikely to faze the average Prada shopper.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, with the Guggenheim gone, the performance space now
will be run by Germano Celant, the director of the Prada Foundation.
Celant plans to hold occasional dance performances, lectures or film
events in the space. The rest of the time, it will remain a shoe
display.</TE>
<TE>   As such, a work that strives to be a serious act of social
commentary becomes nothing more than a monument to corporate
self-promotion. As a shoe display, the Wave--which dominates both
floors of the boutique--seems overblown in relation to its actual
function. As a performance space, it verges on pretentious. One
imagines its rows of seating filled with "champagne socialists,"
earnestly arguing over the political meaning of an Antonioni film
while suspiciously clutching their Prada backpacks.</TE>
<TE>   That could change. Prada has severely overextended its financial
resources over the past few years. The corporation may soon have to
scale back its ambitions, which include plans for Koolhaas-designed
boutiques in Beverly Hills and San Francisco. The New York store
could someday be closed, and in other hands, it could be turned into
a fine performance space.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the project stands as one of Koolhaas' least
successful works. Brimming with unresolved ideas, it proves that a
seemingly unlimited budget is as apt to suffocate creative thought as
to liberate it.</TE>

<HD>For Kids, It Won't Be Tough Sledding</HD>
<DH>Disney's lightweight but inoffensive 'Snow Dogs' sends
Miami dentist Cuba Gooding Jr. off to Alaska to claim his
inheritance: a pack of huskies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember those live-action Disney features in which Dean Jones or,
reaching back earlier, Fred MacMurray would play a hapless grown-up
at odds with kids, animals and/or enchanted cars? Good, bad or
indifferent, those movies were, for children of a certain age, as
sweet, gooey and disposable as ice-cream sandwiches. Every generation
is entitled to its dopey, sticky junk and, deep into the winter
blahs, they don't get stickier or dopier than "Snow Dogs."</LD>
<LD>   Cuba Gooding Jr. is the Dean Jones figure in this lightweight,
ungainly farce in which he plays Dr. Ted Brooks, serene ruler over a
Miami chain of dental clinics. One day, he is served with legal
papers requiring that he fly to the tiny town of Tolketna, Alaska, to
collect his dead mother's inheritance. Obviously, this is a mistake,
since Ted's widowed mother Amelia (Nichelle Nichols) is standing
right in front of him. Well, no, says Amelia, who hadn't found the
nerve before now to tell Ted that he'd been adopted.</LD>
<TE>   So Ted flies off to the middle of nowhere to see where he really
comes from. And what he finds is a village of eccentrics and
grotesques mimeographed from a rejected episode of "Northern
Exposure." The most intimidating of all is a prickly, sour piece of
work named Thunder Jack (James Coburn), who wants Ted to sell him a
rambunctious team of sled dogs that make up part of Ted's late
mother's legacy. An improbably gorgeous tavern owner named Barb
(Joanna Bacalso) warns Ted not to do anything rash.</TE>
<TE>   Ted, for his part, still wonders why his mother gave him up for
adoption and who his father was.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ted is reluctantly struggling to bond with his husky
dogs who, through digital magic, are shown winking, nodding and
smirking at their greenhorn proprietor as he tries to reorganize them
into a sled team. Barb and Jack offer helpful hints on such dog craft
while withholding secrets about Ted's roots. No revelations will come
in this space, beyond saying that a multiculturalism unimaginable in
the mid-20th century era of Disney entertainment is one of the things
with which this movie is both nimble and boisterously oblivious.</TE>
<TE>   These and other throwaway plot lines are tugged, ripped and
snarled with dogged artlessness by director Brian Levant, whose
resume includes such live-action cartoons as "The Flintstones." Given
that this is one of those screenplays with five writers (and who
knows how many uncredited others), one supposes that "Snow Dogs"
could have been an even bigger mess than it is. Cold comfort, indeed,
as you'd expect someone to say in this context.</TE>
<TE>   Of Gooding's presence here, you'd also expect smart-alecks of all
persuasions to shout "Show me the money, indeed!" at the screen.
Still, he's as game and as cuddly as the project requires, rolling
and tumbling through the frosty landscapes, making funny faces at
dogs and bears. Coburn, meanwhile, eases one's passage through this
thick, arduous terrain with a lively, laid-back performance. He's a
crafty old pro who wears the artificially grizzled skin of his
character with accommodating grace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for mild, crude humor. Times guidelines: one
risque throwaway line and a few scatological references.</TE>

<HD>Philharmonic Turns to Shostakovich</HD>
<DH>The first in a cycle of concerts exploring the composer
brings freshness to his student symphony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new year for the Los Angeles Philharmonic began last week with
its continuing focus on Schoenberg, but then the orchestra turned an
abrupt corner. This week and next, the attention is on Shostakovich.
Esa-Pekka Salonen will conduct a cycle of the 15 Shostakovich
symphonies, three a season, concluding in 2006, the centennial of the
Russian composer's birth. It began Wednesday night at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion with Shostakovich's First Symphony. Next week
brings the Second and Third.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the Philharmonic has initiated a parallel cycle of
Shostakovich's 15 string quartets. The first three were played by
different quartets of Philharmonic string players Monday night at the
Skirball Cultural Center as part of the orchestra's chamber music
series, and one quartet is included in the "Upbeat Live" segments
before each orchestral concert.</LD>
<LD>   Already, controversy has erupted. In a recent polemic in the New
Republic, Richard Taruskin, Russian-music scholar at UC Berkeley,
discounted UCLA musicologist Susan McClary's pronouncement made at a
Philharmonic symposium last fall that Schoenberg was "the most
consequential musician of the 20th century."</LD>
<TE>   Taruskin contends that Shostakovich deserves that distinction
because his music had a social purpose and it meant more than any
other art in Soviet society. On the other hand, it could be argued
that Schoenberg's social role, in Europe and Los Angeles, has been
underappreciated. And there is always the issue of whether
Shostakovich's music, for all its wry irony and effective expression
of political repression, is of a consistently high standard.</TE>
<TE>   That standard is what Salonen seems most eager to explore. Like
many musicians over 40, he is the product of a Modernist sensibility
that once dismissed Shostakovich outright. In his youth, he agreed
with Boulez, who called the symphonies warmed-over Mahler. But at a
press conference last year, Salonen said that he has decided now to
make up his own mind.</TE>
<TE>   What Salonen brings is a fresh approach. The First Symphony is a
graduation exercise that thrust the 19-year-old Leningrad music
student suddenly into the limelight. It was so popular that it made
it all the way to Los Angeles; the Philharmonic played it just four
years after its 1926 premiere.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, it has achieved masterpiece status. Four recordings of the
symphony have been released over the last three months--in the
commemorative CD sets put out by the New York Philharmonic, Cleveland
Orchestra and Boston Symphony, along with a commercial CD by Jesus
Lopez-Cobos and the Cincinnati Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   The masterpiece syndrome tends to elevate the symphony into a
major statement. On Wednesday, however, Salonen reminded us that this
is the work of impish rebellion, of a brilliant student struggling to
conform to conservatory-required convention while thumbing his nose
at it. The slow movement reacts to the death of a friend, but the
symphony also conveys the sense of liberation of a composer about to
make his way in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Salonen kept the symphony clear and light, forcing little, alert
to the sense of play in the music. Above all, he conducted it as a
youthful exercise, full of spirit and humor. There was a bit of a
letdown in the heavier third and fourth movements, but overall it was
an inventive reading and had the advantage of Michele Zukovsky's
wonderfully quirky clarinet solos.</TE>
<TE>   Shostakovich was surrounded by other Russians on Wednesday.
Salonen prefaced each half of the program with "Night on Bald
Mountain," first the version by Rimsky-Korsakov, then Mussorgsky's
original.</TE>
<TE>   Both were arresting, each in its own way. Rimsky's orchestrations
and arrangement are full of lush color. Mussorgsky's own score is a
riveting mess, a raw and frightening evocation of a witch's Sabbath
that reflects the composer's own existential angst.</TE>
<TE>   In an different spirit, the program concluded with Scriabin's
"Prometheus," a tone poem of ever more ecstatic, orgasmic yearning,
for piano and orchestra. Scriabin wanted colors with his music, and
Salonen gave them to him, not only in a expertly controlled
performance, but with an actual light show provided by laser artist
Steve Shapiro of Laserium. It looked like an update of the old light
shows that used to accompany psychedelic rock concerts at the
Fillmore in the '60s, but then the Scriabin revival in the '60s was
helped along by the psychedelic atmosphere of those times. Still, the
soloist, Alexander Toradze, needed no visual help as he threw himself
into this music with irresistible abandon.</TE>
<TE>   The early Shostakovich quartets are almost as far removed from the
early symphonies as are works like "Prometheus," which Shostakovich
happened to despise. The first quartet was written a decade after the
First Symphony (it falls between the Fifth and Sixth), a light score
meant to help scare away Stalin's looming shadow. The second and
third quartets are intense works from wartime and just after. The
most impressive performance on Monday was of the Third Quartet, which
was led by Akiko Tarumoto, an electrifying young member of the second
violin section. This is another Shostakovich, a preview of what
awaits us.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic program repeats today (Shostakovich
and Scriabin, only) and Saturday at 8 p.m., Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, Los Angeles Music Center, 135 N. Grand Ave., downtown L.A.

<HD>Still Austere, but With a Little Dark Humor</HD>
<DH>"What Time Is It There?" marks a change for Taiwanese
director Tsai Ming-Liang: Set in Paris and Taipei, it holds out an
uncharacteristic ray of hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the past decade, Tsai Ming-Liang has made five features that have
contributed to making the Taiwanese cinema among the most venturesome
and challenging in the world today. All five have surfaced locally in
festivals and film series, with the second, "Vive l'Amour," receiving
a brief run. "What Time Is It There?" is Tsai's latest and marks a
change in tone for the director.</LD>
<LD>   Tsai's films are studies of loneliness and isolation set in
Taipei, which has become a modern, impersonal metropolis in a nation
that has undergone wrenching social changes with rapid economic
expansion and the end of martial law.</LD>
<LD>   Those who have not seen any of Tsai's previous films, all of which
are austere and demanding, would be surprised to know that "What
Time" is actually his lightest work, its open ending offering a ray
of hope. The dark absurdist humor that runs through Tsai's films is
stronger here than in any of his previous pictures.</LD>
<TE>   "What Time" cuts among three individuals: a young street vendor,
Hsiao Kang (Lee Kang-Sheng), who sells watches near a train station
in the bustling heart of Taipei; his recently widowed mother (Lu
Yi-Cheng), whose grief over the loss of her husband swiftly grows
into an obsessive yearning for his return in spirit; and Shiang-Chyi
(Chen Shiang-Chyi), who buys a watch from Hsiao before taking off for
a vacation in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Shiang-Chyi want a watch that offers dual times, so
she will always know what time it is in Taipei when she is in Paris,
she wants the very one Hsiao happens to be wearing. He resists
selling it to her because he feels to do so would somehow bring him
bad luck because of his father's recent death.</TE>
<TE>   When he gets her one like it, she rewards him with some pastry.
That Shiang-Chyi proves to be thoughtful as well as pretty captures
Hsiao's heart before he realizes it.</TE>
<TE>   The next thing we know, he's setting all his dual-time watches set
to Paris and Taipei time, and then he sets as many clocks around the
city as possible to Paris time, at one point even going to the top of
a tall building with a long stick to maneuver the giant hands of a
clock near the top of one of its high walls.</TE>
<TE>   As Hsiao grows mildly obsessive, his mother becomes positively
demented, following all the rituals of the ancient religious and
folkloric beliefs said to attract the spirits of the deceased;
loneliness and isolation giving way to obsession is typical of Tsai's
people.</TE>
<TE>   Shiang-Chyi settles into a tiny room in a noisy Paris hotel,
repeatedly making unsuccessful phone calls and rummaging in her purse
for a slip of paper with a phone number on it, suggesting that she
has gone to the City of Light hoping to connect with someone,
possibly a former lover. Of the world's great cities, Paris may well
be the least friendly, and Shiang-Chyi becomes aimless as loneliness
overcomes her.</TE>
<TE>   Only another Chinese woman (Cecilia Yip) and Jean-Pierre Leaud,
whose youthful self is seen in a video of "The 400 Hundred Blows"
that Hsiao buys, offer Shiang-Chyi kindness and concern. (Leaud and
Shiang-Chyi, who does not recognize him, briefly share a bench in a
cemetery.)</TE>
<TE>   Despite his homage to Francois Truffaut, Tsai is actually more
influenced by Robert Bresson, for his people, like those of Bresson,
are in search of spiritual redemption. And like the Japanese master
Yasujiro Ozu, Tsai favors a stationary camera, which has the effect
of flooding the screen with the emotions his people are experiencing.</TE>
<TE>   The formality and grace that Tsai and his cinematographer,
France's masterly Benoit Delhomme, bring to "What Time" provide a
splendid contrast to the feeling of often humorous spontaneity that
runs throughout the film, an effect heightened by the
unself-conscious naturalism of Tsai's actors. So assured is Tsai as a
filmmaker that he pulls off a lovely sleight of hand at his film's
climax as skillfully as Michelangelo Antonioni pulled off a similar
maneuver in "Blow-Up."</TE>
<TE>   With the release of "What Time Is It There?" and the news that
Tsai's masterpiece, "The River" (1997), has at last been picked up by
an American distributor, there is reason to hope that more Taiwanese
films will be surfacing in theaters, allowing wider audiences to
discover a flowering cinema that has captivated critics at festivals
for 10 years.</TE>

<LD>It gets, in case you hadn't noticed, awfully cold and bleak in
Copenhagen in the winter, and the Danes, who definitely have noticed,
often escape in thoughts of Italy, a place that symbolizes passion,
romance and several kinds of warmth.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes they even try to learn the language, which is where
"Italian for Beginners," as completely charming a romantic comedy as
this still new year is likely to see, enters the picture.</LD>
<LD>   A delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a
Copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life
tosses at them, "Italian for Beginners" won a Silver Bear and other
awards at Berlin, where it was much talked about for being the first
picture made in the cinema verite Dogma style to be written and
directed by a woman, Lone Scherfig.</LD>
<TE>   None of this, however, matters as much as how expertly Scherfig
has molded her characters and constructed her plot, which is laden
with crafty complications and unexpected catastrophes, but is so well
put together you never notice how much work has gone into it.</TE>
<TE>   Like its fellow Scandinavian production, Sweden's "Together,"
"Italian for Beginners" is a textured comedy, not afraid to season
its humor with anger, mortality and unapologetically bleak moments.</TE>
<TE>   It's a film that recognizes the laughter and sorrow of a question
such as "How soon after someone dies can you fall in love?" And it's
a film that manages, without making a fuss, to make points about the
nature of faith, the difficulty of parents, even the consequences of
fetal alcohol syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, however, "Italian for Beginners" is about
falling in love. It focuses on six individuals, none of whom is
particularly adept at romance, which they approach in different ways
and at different speeds. Most of all, these are people who understand
the truth of Pastor Andreas' remark: "It is in loneliness that God
seems farthest away."</TE>
<TE>   The pastor (Anders W. Berthelsen) knows this as much as anyone. A
young and very recent widower, he arrives in town to replace a cranky
older colleague who got so out of hand he threw the church organist
off a balcony and still hangs around to heckle Andreas' sermons. The
new pastor is told that a community center class in conversational
Italian might help pass the time, so he goes.</TE>
<TE>   Already attending are two men who work at the hotel Andreas is put
up at. Jorgen Mortensen (Peter Gantzler), who manages the place, is a
quiet, diffident man with serious romantic difficulties, while his
best friend, Hal-Finn (Lars Kaalund), is an abrasive lout who runs
the hotel's sports bar and systematically abuses his customers.</TE>
<TE>   Hal-Finn became passionate about the language after an Italian
soccer team made his bar its local hangout. Not needing language
lessons, at least not in Italian, is the sports bar's young and
beautiful Italian waitress, Giulia (Sara Indrio Jensen).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two other women end up at the classes. Karen (Ann Eleonora
Jorgensen) runs a hair salon and has no end of trouble with her
failing alcoholic mother. Olympia (Anette Stovelbaek), works at a
bakery while dodging the wrath of her intemperate father. Her
longevity at the shop is open to question, however; because she's
very clumsy, she's had 43 jobs since she left high school.</TE>
<TE>   As even these thumbnail sketches indicate, the great thing about
"Italian for Beginners" is that all of its people are completely and
unmistakably individual. This is a film that likes and is intrigued
by its characters, that allows them to be eccentric, funnier than
they realize and very much themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that life is about comedy and melancholy,"
writer-director Scherfig has said, and "Italian for Beginners" shows
what an irresistible blend that can be.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and some sexuality. Times guidelines:
relatively mild though repeated use of vulgar language.</TE>

<HD>Slamdance Elbows Its Way to Respectability</HD>
<DH>Still something of an upstart, the other Park City film
festival has sponsors, spawned a few deals and even gained Sundance's
blessing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Jamie Strohfeldt calls it her "bat cave."</LD>
<LD>   Each day since the Slamdance Film Festival opened here last week
in a converted silver mine high above this ski resort town, massage
therapist Strohfeldt has invited frazzled, anxiety-ridden independent
filmmakers to turn off their cell phones, stop worrying for a few
minutes if a distributor will buy their movies and experience the
healing powers of a professional massage.</LD>
<LD>   With flickering candles providing the only light in her makeshift
therapy room, which is set up one floor under the Slamdance screening
room, she urges the filmmakers to relax as she gently kneads their
back and shoulder muscles with her aromatic-scented fingers.</LD>
<TE>   "I find that everyone is really super tense and also very excited
about their film," Strohfeldt says. "And this is a space where they
can let themselves be in the moment and bring themselves back to the
excitement of knowing why they are here. It's a space where they
retrieve their soul."</TE>
<TE>   You think filmmakers attending the larger, more prestigious
Sundance Film Festival running simultaneously this week down the hill
need to relax? Check out Slamdance.</TE>
<TE>   These filmmakers seem willing to go to nearly any length, even
arrest, just to get their films noticed by the hundreds of media
representatives who have flooded into town to cover Sundance.</TE>
<TE>   Take director Chris Haifley and producer Nene Gonzalez, who
brought a movie called "Ronnie" to Slamdance this year. There they
were Monday afternoon, standing across the street from the Egyptian
Theater on Main Street scoping out both ends of the thoroughfare,
hoping the cops weren't coming.</TE>
<TE>   Then, from out of nowhere, one of their actors, a husky fellow
named Matt Casado who plays a drug addict named Rat in the film, came
running down the street zigzagging between cars dressed in a blue
G-string and holding aloft a "Ronnie" poster while yelling like a
banshee.</TE>
<TE>   "Slamdance is big," Haifley said, "but it's still overshadowed by
Sundance, so we're just out doing what we can do."</TE>
<TE>   It has now been eight years since Slamdance came into existence,
formed by filmmakers whose movies were rejected by Sundance.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Slamdance is still a showcase for budding talent,
fresh ideas, edgy material and those crazy promotions. In short, a
platform for films that might otherwise have never been seen.</TE>
<TE>   But Slamdance is no longer the annoying neighbor everyone wishes
would just pack up and leave.</TE>
<TE>   True, you won't find the mega-deals going down here as you do at
Sundance, or as many big-name celebrities posing for paparazzi (if at
all), but there are subtle and not-so-subtle signs that Slamdance has
finally come out of the cold.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, this is the first year that Park City has run a
free shuttle to and from Slamdance, in this case the old Silver Mine
where the festival this year has its headquarters, holds its seminars
and screens its movies.</TE>
<TE>   (The site was once a busy mining operation; then it was
transformed into a public tour. It is a weird sight to see rusting
ore carts and stuffed mannequins dressed up like old prospectors
dotting the Slamdance venue.)</TE>
<TE>   For another, Sundance founder and actor Robert Redford is
encouraging the upstart festival to keep doing what it is doing
because it's all in the same cause.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Baxter, president of Slamdance, recalls that Redford wasn't
always that way.</TE>
<TE>   "People saw us, as Robert Redford once said, [as] a parasite,"
Baxter said. "At that time, it seemed that Sundance and Slamdance
were more close together in that independent film world. But since
then, that film world has really, I think, fragmented. Today, you can
see that Slamdance is distinguished from Sundance. It really supports
new filmmakers from a grass-roots perspective, whereas on the
Sundance side, you have filmmakers who have been at Sundance before
and had films made by distributors' money."</TE>
<TE>   Redford, in an interview this week, said he wanted to "set the
record straight" on Slamdance.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early years, I was sensitive to just getting started,"
Redford recalled. "It took a lot of years and a lot of hard work to
get established. When someone has success, it's either safe for
someone to come in or [say], 'Oh, I'm going to jump off of that
thing.'</TE>
<TE>   "In the year that they came on, I said, 'This is a rival that is
born out of--I don't know if petulance--but the films couldn't get in
here so they formed their own thing," Redford continued. "Now, what I
also said was, I wished they didn't feel the need to gain attention
to themselves by presenting themselves as an alternative to us, like
we're the bad guys, because there are so many discontents, there are
so many malcontents. People who were ignored or didn't get in and
they're angry or they're bitter. Well, hey, can we not have that?"</TE>
<TE>   Redford said, "The truth is, I don't mind you there at all. I
don't mind you, or two or three others like you there, because the
whole point is to promote independent film and we can't possibly show
all the films."</TE>
<TE>   High-Profile Graduates  and Corporate Sponsors</TE>
<TE>   Baxter pointed to filmmakers who have come through Slamdance, such
as Marc Forster ("Monster's Ball") and Christopher Nolan ("Memento"),
who now have good production deals.</TE>
<TE>   "People are beginning to see now that Slamdance has helped these
filmmakers get to the next step in their careers," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Slamdance's remarkable turnaround can also be seen in its
corporate sponsors. Some of this year's sponsors, in fact, fall
outside the movie industry: Timbuk2 Designs, Kozak vodka and Dos
Equis beer.</TE>
<TE>   "Independent film is now being sold as a type of lifestyle,"
Baxter explained. "... They believe the independent film world is
something which they leverage to help sell their product to a
particular group of people who are--not necessarily filmmakers--but
sort of represents the type of lifestyle that they think their buyers
and customers want."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter described the people who frequent independent films as
"someone who is free-thinking, independent in mind [and] independent
in spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some of the films entered in Slamdance competition this
year require independent tastes.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, "Lurch" is about a man with the job of preserving
animal corpses at the Berlin Natural History Museum. "Lefty-Right"
tells the story of a right-handed man who hears a news report that
left-handed people die earlier than right-handers. Because he leads
such a bleak existence in a small apartment full of clutter, he
decides to become left-handed so he can depart this world a little
quicker.</TE>
<TE>   Slamdance is also quickly becoming a name familiar enough that it
can be marketed. Besides the T-shirts that sell for $15 to $20 each,
or the Slamdance 2002 filmmaker bags that go for $35 each, the news
broke this week that later this year the Moviola cable channel in
Canada will produce 26 one-hour television programs called "The
Slamdance Show." Baxter said the program will feature short films,
many of which first screened at Slamdance, as well as interviews with
independent filmmakers around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Director Alexandre Rockwell, who won the Grand Jury Prize at
Sundance for his 1992 film "In the Soup," believes the growing
respect for Slamdance is a result of the film world seeing it as a
niche.</TE>
<TE>   Director Notes Change in Sundance</TE>
<TE>   "Slamdance doesn't really threaten Sundance because I think
Sundance has really changed in that it really is a hugely commercial
vehicle," Rockwell observed.</TE>
<TE>   "Sundance is a very expensive festival to run, so they are going
to want to attract the Miramaxes and the foreign sales people, and
the only way you are going to do that is to take their movies," he
added. "How are you going to get [Miramax chief] Harvey Weinstein to
come to Sundance unless you take three Miramax films? It's kind of
unspoken, but it's pretty obvious to me. I don't blame them for it.
It's a high-profile festival. If they didn't do that, they wouldn't
get the attendance they get or wouldn't have the success they have.</TE>
<TE>   "Slamdance is not about that," Rockwell added.</TE>
<TE>   Rockwell has returned to Park City, but to Slamdance, not
Sundance. His new film, "13 Moons," features an ensemble cast that
includes Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Beals, David Proval and Karyn
Parsons, and follows seven strangers during one Los Angeles night as
they come together to save the life of a 6-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   Rockwell believes there is probably a point where every film
festival can begin to compromise the reasons it began in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a film festival probably has a life [cycle]," he said.
"It starts out that they have interesting films, then finally people
start coming to see the interesting films, and then it's like a trend
and all of a sudden it gets co-opted by tons of money and then it
kind of loses its intrinsic value. I do believe that, although there
are institution festivals like Venice or Cannes or Berlin. They make
no bones what they are about. They are markets and they are film
festivals. They are like the stodgy old pros. Whereas, any kind of
budding film festival that is going to introduce new talent, that
prides itself on that, is probably going to burn out."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Slamdance burns out at some future date is inconceivable
at this point. Baxter notes that it received more than 2,400 entries
this year, a record.</TE>
<TE>   He also points out that last year, five Slamdance films received
distribution "of one kind or another, some deals bigger than others."
And, he said, this year, five Slamdance alumni are nominated for
Independent Spirit Awards.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel as though it really is a coming of age, it's something
we've believed in for a very long time, but now normal people outside
our organization are seeing that."</TE>
<TE>   And those who don't get into Slamdance? They can always use a good
massage.</TE>

<HD>A Beat Reporter Lands a Prime Anchor Job</HD>
<DH>John Miller's extensive coverage of crime and terrorism
earned him '20/20's' co-anchor spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Summoned to ABC News President David Westin's office, John Miller did
what anyone would when called by the boss: He wracked his brain to
figure out what he'd done wrong.</LD>
<LD>   "Sit down," Westin commanded.</LD>
<LD>   "Am I being fired?" Miller blurted out.</LD>
<TE>   Quite the contrary. ABC's busy crime and terrorism reporter was
being offered a plum job, co-anchor of "20/20," the network's
newsmagazine program, working with Barbara Walters.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight he starts filling a chair that has been vacant since Hugh
Downs retired in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In a business in which virtually everyone dreams of becoming a
network anchor, Miller was an exception. He had never anchored a
newscast of any sort, even during two decades in local New York City
news. He was a cop reporter.</TE>
<TE>   It was a job the 43-year-old Miller was virtually born into. His
father was a syndicated newspaper gossip columnist and would take
John, as young as 9, chasing ambulance and cop calls at night.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids grow up playing cowboys and Indians or cops and
robbers, and they grow out of it," he said. "I never grew out of the
cops and robbers. I thought that stuff was fascinating, and I wanted
to plug into it."</TE>
<TE>   Miller began his on-air TV career at 16. He stayed with it at
three New York stations, including WNBC-TV, for two decades until, in
1994, he became a deputy to former New York City Police Commissioner
William Bratton, in charge of communications.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew an awful lot about the police, but not as much as I
thought I did," he said. "What was more interesting to me was [that]
I thought I knew a lot about the press, only to find out I knew very
little or nothing. Because when you're on the other side, it's all
different."</TE>
<TE>   If he was plugged into the law enforcement community before, the
Bratton connection only intensified the relationship. It was valuable
when Miller joined ABC News in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Paged to report to work immediately on Sept. 11, Miller took out
his police radio. By knowing what came over the scanner and calling
his contacts, Miller was able to keep up a running commentary that
startled ABC anchorman Peter Jennings.</TE>
<TE>   Even more valuable during the last few months was Miller's
expertise in the Al Qaeda terrorist network. He was the last Western
reporter to interview Osama bin Laden, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   At Bin Laden's lair, the guards said the terrorist leader wanted
to see Miller's questions in advance. Miller said ABC didn't do that,
and a guard clicked his assault rifle in response. Miller submitted
his questions.</TE>
<TE>   Not knowing Arabic and not having Bin Laden's words immediately
translated, Miller tried to keep eye contact by nodding at his words
and feigning fascination at what he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the interview was over, Miller's translator told him he had a
big story: Bin Laden had said he was going to kill as many Americans
as he could.</TE>
<TE>   "What was I doing when he was saying that?" Miller asked his
translator.</TE>
<TE>   "You were nodding in agreement," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's ascendance at ABC News coincided with Walters' desire for
an on-air partner. She had worked with a partner during most of her
career, and working alone had left her few opportunities to take a
night off.</TE>
<TE>   She conceded that she wouldn't have considered Miller before Sept.
11, not thinking he was ready. But she and Westin had the same idea
later in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does he bring us the kinds of stories that John can do
with the background that he has, but he also has humor, as you can
see," Walters said. Since Sept. 11, as Miller has produced stories
for ABC newscasts, people who know him comment on his visibility.
They mean well when they tell Miller that "the Sept. 11 thing really
worked out for you."</TE>
<TE>   He sets them straight, naming friends who died, most notably
former FBI terrorism expert John O'Neill, who had just left the FBI
for a job as head of World Trade Center security.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it worked out terribly for me," Miller said. "If the
devil came along and said, 'You can have your friends back, but you
won't be the anchor of "20/20" and nobody will know who you are out
there,' of course I would jump at that."</TE>

<HD>'Slim Shady' Fine Rescinded</HD>
<DH>Radio stations remain wary despite the reversal of the
FCC's ruling. One possible result of the Eminem episode: an increase
in self-policing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A menacing cloud that radio broadcasters saw looming over their
industry--in the form of stricter FCC enforcement on the
airwaves--seems to be dissipating, now that the agency has rescinded
a fine it levied last year against a radio station it accused of
broadcasting indecent material.</LD>
<LD>   In June, the Federal Communications Commission fined KKMG-FM, a
Top 40 station in Colorado Springs, Colo., $7,000 for playing "The
Real Slim Shady" by rapper Eminem--even though it was a "clean"
version of the raunchy album cut and lacked the explicit sexual
language. The action sent a chill through the industry; if a song
edited specifically for radio airplay wasn't safe, then what was?</LD>
<LD>   But last week the agency's enforcement bureau reversed itself,
saying the sexual references in the song were oblique and didn't
violate its standards for indecency.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously we're real happy about it," KKMG general manager Brenda
Goodrich said. "It's not only a victory for us, but for radio
stations around the country. This would have set a huge precedent."</TE>
<TE>   The FCC guidelines--spelled out, with examples, on the agency's
Web site--prohibit obscene content and restrict what it defines as
indecent: that is, messages containing "sexual or excretory
references" in terms "patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards."</TE>
<TE>   Typically what got stations fined under those rules were lewd
comments made by disc jockeys or guests or language in a raunchy
novelty song sneaked on the air once or twice. For example, at the
same time it rescinded the "Slim Shady" fine, the FCC's enforcement
bureau upheld its $14,000 fine against WKQX-FM in Chicago for a
segment in which its DJ, Mancow, interviewed a porn actress and other
women about sexual practices.</TE>
<TE>   But an indecency ruling and a fine for playing a Top 10 song aired
continually on stations nationwide? That action dismayed
broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   "If they fine us, how are they not going to fine every station in
the country that's playing it?" Goodrich asked.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Goodrich said she feared the "Slim Shady" ruling
would not only have constricted what broadcasters were already
playing but would even have made songwriters and performers think
twice about what they wrote or recorded.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment was shared by Hilary Rosen, president and chief
executive of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, who said at the
time that the case seemed to be a threat to artistic expression and
freedom of speech and that the ruling "almost appears to be a value
judgment on the music."</TE>
<TE>   A KKMG listener objected to the lyrics in July 2000 and complained
to the FCC. After an investigation, it levied the fine the following
June.</TE>
<TE>   In its rebuttal, Citadel Communications, KKMG's Las Vegas-based
parent company, contended that the sexual references in the song "are
intended merely to satirize and parody popular culture and not to
titillate, shock or pander to listeners." Upon reviewing the case
further, the FCC agreed, saying that the sexual references in the
edited version "are not expressed in terms sufficiently explicit or
graphic enough to be found patently offensive," the legal threshold
for something to be deemed indecent.</TE>
<TE>   But another case from last summer that troubled broadcasters
remains on the books. A public radio station in Portland, Ore., was
fined $7,000 for playing a feminist rapper's song using the
suggestive and sexist language of other hip-hop tunes to criticize
their misogyny. The FCC said the political message was irrelevant,
while the shocking language merited a $7,000 fine for indecency. The
station, KBOO-FM, appealed the fine, and the case is still pending.</TE>
<TE>   Even though KKMG was vindicated, Goodrich said the "Slim Shady"
experience has made station officials more wary about the songs they
play. And the ruling has caused controversy even within the FCC, with
Commissioner Michael J. Copps saying that the agency's enforcement
bureau should have let the case go forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an important decision with an element of controversy," Copps
said, and thus should have been discussed by him and the other
members of the five-person commission that gives the agency its name
and acts as its final arbiter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Copps said the FCC makes it too hard on people who
want to complain about vulgarities on the air. To investigate, the
agency requires a tape or transcript of the offending broadcast. So
Copps suggested recently that radio stations ought to record their
broadcasts and save them.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to send them to Big Brother government in Washington so we
can pore over them," he said, but so the recordings can be used to
quickly and easily verify or debunk citizen complaints about
indecency on the airwaves. "I don't think that's intrusive. Using the
public airwaves is a privilege, and with privileges come
responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disney Chairman Michael Eisner promised Copps that the radio
stations of its ABC subsidiary would record their broadcasts and
archive the tapes for two months.</TE>
<TE>   "They get the good corporate citizenship award for December,"
Copps said. In fact, ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the company's
"radio stations for many, many years--probably for 20 years--had been
keeping tapes of their broadcasts. For a number of the stations, 60
days will be the minimum, and they will continue to keep tapes for
longer than that."</TE>
<TE>   Such a policy seems to be the industry exception, however. "We
have not formally considered the issue of recording broadcasts, and
at this time we have no plans to do so," said Kate Healey, director
of media and investor relations at the Indianapolis-based Emmis
Communications Corp., owner of WKQX-FM in Chicago. Regarding the
FCC's Mancow decision, Healy would say only that "we're evaluating
our options."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio
conglomerate, with almost 1,200 stations, does not record its
broadcasts, "nor do we plan to," said spokeswoman Pam Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Copps said he hopes the public becomes concerned enough about
keeping the airwaves clean to encourage more broadcasters to start
recording themselves and, in so doing, better police themselves. But
he added that such an effort ought to start at the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could get all the commissioners' attention on this, and
speaking out on this," he said, "that would be a huge leap forward."</TE>

<HD>Swept by Irony in the Desert</HD>
<DH>John Steppling's 'Dog Mouth' ventures into the stark, arid
existence of a man whose disconnection from human emotion is the key
to his survival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been said that all great travelers wind up in the desert. Nature
at its most unchanging, the desert is a pure and ferocious landscape
with few distractions, where the mind's eye can be cast inward.</LD>
<LD>   After many literary peregrinations, John Steppling ventures into
the desert in "Dog Mouth," a play set in an arid wasteland somewhere
outside of Phoenix. One of L.A.'s most distinctive home-grown
playwrights, Steppling has spent the last few years in Europe, a
fugitive from the soulless grind of the California dream machine. For
Steppling, the play's current production at the Evidence Room proves
both a homecoming and a departure.</LD>
<LD>   Many of Steppling's past plays, such as "The Shaper" and "Dream
Coast," were indigenous L.A. dramas inextricably linked to Hollywood
and its environs. Down-and-outers scrabbling on the margins of
Hollywood, the characters in those plays were typically sub-literates
defined by their consumerist longings, whose drug abuse and criminal
behavior brought them no closer to their shallow, shining dream.</LD>
<TE>   The setting of "Dog Mouth"--the Arizona desert--is, in itself, a
statement of intent for Steppling, a stripping away of the
"Steppling-esque" elements that define his work. In this stark desert
landscape, there is no there there--nothing to covet and little to
desire--just a train track and sand, the central components of Jason
Adams' strikingly spare set.</TE>
<TE>   Dog Mouth (Stephen Davies), the protagonist of the play, lives an
existence as bare as the country he inhabits. Gone too is the
drug-fueled incoherence of Steppling's earlier heroes. Towering and
lucid, Dog Mouth is almost Shakespearean in his utterances.</TE>
<TE>   The head of a murderous hobo gang, Dog Mouth entertains no
apparent need for human connection, save for his criminal conniving
with scruffy underlings such as Becker (James Storm) and the
occasional roll in the sand with Nyah (Nia Gwynne), his pregnant
young girlfriend. Once a noted breeder of fighting dogs, Dog Mouth is
considering buying a pit bull from Weeks (Hugh Dane), yet he wants
nothing to do with Nyah or her child.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is obvious. Steppling dabbled with similar themes in
"Standard of the Breed," which also used fighting dogs as an
operative metaphor. Here, dogs serve as a feral emblem for the
disconnection that is essential to Dog Mouth's survival. When he
brushes too close to human emotions, when Nyah asks him to "feel"
their child moving in her womb, Dog Mouth must pull back--or suffer a
fatal fall. A have-not with a vengeance, he's an elemental
figure--Lear on a sandy heath, cast out by his own design.</TE>

<HD>Juilliard Quartet Seeks Its Old Heat</HD>
<DH>The group stumbles in Mozart and Schubert pieces but
reclaims some of its signature fire in a reading of Bartok.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even without founding first violinist and sparkplug Robert Mann, who
left in 1997, the Juilliard String Quartet keeps on running--and it
is here this week for a mini-residency at USC doing its bit for music
new, old and in between, with public performances and master classes.
The quartet's opening concert at Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday night
was followed by an open rehearsal of Ralph Shapey's String Quartet
No. 10 on Thursday--and tonight it plays its transcription of J.S.
Bach's "The Art of the Fugue."</LD>
<LD>   But on Wednesday night, something essential was missing from the
music.</LD>
<LD>   There were problems with blurred, delayed attacks in the opening
Mozart Quartet in B flat, K. 589--and the musicians had to retune
their instruments frequently through the performance. But then, you
don't necessarily go to Juilliard concerts expecting super-precise,
absolutely in-tune ensemble playing all the time.</LD>
<TE>   What you do expect--or did expect--from this foursome is drive,
coiled intensity, visceral excitement, a sense of abandon that
despite some mellowing over the decades, could still reinvigorate old
classics with an urban flavor. These were the crucial missing
ingredients Wednesday, particularly in the sprawling, nearly
symphonic expanses of Schubert's Quartet No. 15 in G, D. 887, whose
scherzo and finale surprisingly lacked crispness and compelling
rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   The closest the Juilliard came to regaining its edge was in
Bartok's Quartet No. 6--and a good thing, too, for this was the group
that essentially put the Bartok cycle on the map in the late 1940s,
eventually recording it three times (the second cycle from the 1960s
being best).</TE>
<TE>   While No. 6 has reminders of the acerbic experiments of the middle
quartets, its most compelling feature is the melancholy motive that
leads off each movement--and violist Samuel Rhodes, now the
Juilliard's senior statesman (he joined in 1969), stated it with
especially bleak eloquence in the first movement. Again, the old
urgency was muted, but Bartok still managed to communicate.</TE>

<HD>Creator Decides to Close the Book on 'The X-Files'</HD>
<DH>Television* Chris Carter says the series, in its ninth
year, will end this season. The Fox show had declined in the ratings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON and PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His show had been on the brink before, but Chris Carter, creator of
Fox's atmospheric "The X-Files," was up almost all night before the
series broke for its recent holiday hiatus. Carter says he was in an
upbeat mood, though heavier thoughts weighed on him during the break.</LD>
<LD>   Carter finally gave voice to those concerns Wednesday, deciding
that this season, the show's ninth, would mark the final chapter for
one of Fox's most significant, influential and--until recent ratings
declines--profitable series.</LD>
<LD>   The moody drama has been struggling in the ratings, its viewership
having steadily declined since star David Duchovny reduced his
presence two seasons ago before exiting the series entirely this
year. Gillian Anderson, Duchovny's co-lead, was scheduled to leave at
the end of this season.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought about this a lot over the holiday, and I wanted the
show to go out on a strong, positive note," Carter said late
Wednesday, not long after informing the cast and crew of his
decision. "We've done such good work this season, and I wanted to
honor that."</TE>
<TE>   "The X-Files," in its heyday a major hit for Fox among the
18-to-49-year-old age bracket that advertisers target, is down 41% in
that key demographic from this time a year ago. Overall, the show has
been averaging 8.7 million viewers this year, down dramatically from
its peak season (1996-97), when the weekly audience was 18.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation has been brewing, in fact, that Fox might be forced to
cancel the show because of the ratings decline. Network officials
were noncommittal about its future--as well as that of "Ally McBeal,"
which is also struggling--during a recent news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Carter disagreed with those who have attributed the diminished
ratings to the increased profile of Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish,
who play FBI agents who have taken over the principal task of
investigating the mysterious "X files"--so-called because they
involved unexplained phenomena--from Agents Fox Mulder (Duchovny) and
Dana Scully (Anderson).</TE>
<TE>   "It's just unfair for them to be blamed, because they are so
terrific," Carter said. "The series was being judged by what it was
rather than by what it has become."</TE>
<TE>   Also, the series faced formidable competition on Sunday nights
this season from two new dramas, ABC's "Alias" and NBC's "Law &amp;
Order: Criminal Intent."</TE>
<TE>   The series finale, which will be the show's 201st episode, will
"wrap up many threads that we have developed through the years,"
Carter said, adding it would be "a celebration of the series."</TE>
<TE>   "I spoke to David, Gillian, Robert and Annabeth, and it was very
difficult," Carter said, citing others associated with the
show--including executive producers Frank Spotnitz and Vince
Gilligan--who have been with him from almost the beginning of the
series. However, Carter promised that "The X-Files" would continue as
a feature film franchise, building on the "The X-Files" movie, which
20th Century Fox released in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "A movie is a done deal," he said, adding that Duchovny and
Anderson have agreed to star.</TE>
<TE>   As for Carter, he said he has several other projects in the works,
including TV shows and a movie for Dimension Films. Since "The
X-Files," Carter has created three failed TV series for Fox:
"Millennium," "Harsh Realm" and "X-Files" spinoff "The Lone Gunmen."</TE>
<TE>   "The X-Files" debuted on Fox in September 1993 and quickly gained
the cultish devotion of viewers held rapt by its moody look and back
story. Duchovny and Anderson proved a winning team of TV stars,
although the show, for the most part, didn't exploit any romantic
involvement between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers instead feasted on the show's intricate conspiracy
scenarios and shadowy supporting characters, who came with names such
as Cigarette Smoking Man, Deep Throat and Mr. X.</TE>
<TE>   Such mythology helped stoke Internet chat and build awareness of
the show. After shooting in Vancouver, Canada, for its first five
seasons, "The X-Files" moved to Los Angeles in 1998. The move to L.A.
helped inflate the show's production cost, which was estimated to be
in the neighborhood of $3 million an episode.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Duchovny filed suit against 20th Century Fox, the studio
that produces "The X-Files," alleging breach of contract regarding
his profit participation in the show. That dispute was eventually
settled, but Duchovny opted to reduce his commitment to the series to
just half the episodes.</TE>

<HD>Coltrane and Brackeen Unite for a Provocative Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few years ago, pianist Herbie Hancock and saxophonist Wayne Shorter
stepped into a demanding genre of improvisation, performing
spontaneously as a duo, with no preset tunes or arrangements. Despite
the abstract nature of the music, their performances were largely
greeted by full crowds and favorable critical reviews.</LD>
<LD>   This week at the Jazz Bakery, a considerably less visible
duo--pianist Joanne Brackeen and saxophonist Ravi Coltrane--is taking
on a similar task. Although most of their collaborations are based on
preexisting material, the results are no less provocative--the
product of two probingly imaginative musical minds. So one wonders
why, on Wednesday night, so few listeners were in attendance, and
whether the jazz celebrity aura attached to Hancock and Shorter can
really make that much of a difference in what draws an audience. If
so, it would be a shame.</LD>
<LD>   Brackeen and Coltrane are offering music that--if different in
style and content from Hancock and Shorter--is similarly compelling,
a journey through a luxurious landscape filled with unexpected
improvisational byways. A good part of the pleasure of hearing the
interface between the pair stemmed from the opportunity to share
their sense of discovery. The whiplash bebop line of "Cram 'n Exam"
(written by Brackeen) exploded in fast-fingered unison, a springboard
for Coltrane's own horn scouring improvisation.</LD>
<TE>   A ballad rendering of "Time Was" ("Duerme" in Miguel Prado's
Mexican original) blended Brackeen's thickly clustered harmonies and
rhapsodic arpeggios with Coltrane's unique cool sound and superheated
runs. A final romp through "Giant Steps" served to link the
63-year-old Brackeen, who came to jazz in the late '50s, with the
36-year-old Coltrane, who was not quite 2 when his iconic father,
John passed away.</TE>
<TE>   There were, in addition, two other intriguing segments in the set.
The first was a Brackeen solo excursion through "Bewitched, Bothered
and Bewildered" in which the stunning creativity of this vastly
underappreciated pianist was on full display--initially disguising
the tune with melodic fragments and thick, turbulent harmonies,
eventually allowing its pure lyricism to rise to the surface. The
second was a spontaneous improvisation between Brackeen and Coltrane
in which their joint tendencies to rigorously examine every aspect of
a harmonic phrase sometimes clashed, sometimes synchronized,
but--like the balance of the program--always resulted in provocative
music.</TE>

<LD>   The one-hour "Now With Bill Moyers," airing locally Fridays at 9
p.m. on KCET, has come together only in the last couple of months.
Moyers, who put aside several other projects to make time for the
show, says that while the vision is for a program that tells stories
other news outlets don't, with guests "other than the usual suspects
of pundits," "Now" probably will evolve in coming weeks as the staff
finds its way.</LD>
<LD>   One element that will remain constant is input from National
Public Radio reporters and commentators; the two organizations have
been trying to find a way to work together for some time. Tonight's
show will include a commentary by NPR's John Ridley on the
commercialization of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Former NPR talk-show host Juan Williams will also look at the
spiritual leader of a Cleveland mosque whose reputation as an
interfaith leader has been questioned after reports he made
anti-Semitic remarks a decade ago. Another story asks members of a
Texas church whether they are Christians or Americans first. The
report on lobbyists examines a House bill on energy policy, its
environmental consequences, the subsidies it offers energy companies
and the companies' campaign contributions.</TE>

<HD>When Race, Fear and  a Horrific Act Intersect</HD>
<DH>Theater*  Based on a mother who drowned her children and
blamed an imaginary black man, 'Brutal Imagination' brings the
phantom to life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KUCHWARA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>He was the fictional creation of Susan Vaughan Smith, the white South
Carolina woman who, in 1994, drowned her two small sons and blamed a
phantom black man for the crimes.</LD>
<LD>   For nine days, from the time she reported her children missing to
her confession, Smith insisted that this elusive figure had kidnapped
little Michael and Alexander, ages 3 and 14 months, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   Now poet Cornelius Eady, with the help of director Diane Paulus
and composer Diedre Murray, has brought the imaginary scapegoat to
life in "Brutal Imagination," a 75-minute theatrical meditation on
race and fear--and what one does to the other.</LD>
<TE>   Their efforts, starring Sally Murphy as Smith and Joe Morton as
Mr. Zero (the name given Smith's fictitious carjacker), are on view
at off-Broadway's enterprising Vineyard Theatre. The theater is where
such major works as Paula Vogel's "How I Learned to Drive" and Edward
Albee's "Three Tall Women" received their New York premieres, and
where Paulus staged "Eli's Comin'," the hit Laura Nyro musical last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Brutal Imagination" was originally a book of poems before Eady,
who also wrote the Pulitzer Prize finalist "Running Man," decided to
turn it into a piece for the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "If she says that this imaginary guy is real, then let's go with
that," said Eady, sipping coffee in the theater's lobby during a
break in rehearsals and explaining how his interpretation of Smith's
creation began. The poet said he began by putting together a
character sketch.</TE>
<TE>   "What would this man dress like? What would he say? How would he
move through those nine days?" Eady explained. "I began playing with
that notion. Where would he go? What would he do? And it immediately
came to my mind that he was driving. All he is doing is driving and
no one can find him. No one can see him--but everyone sees him. So he
is constantly in motion."</TE>
<TE>   Eady, who began working on the poems six years ago, deliberately
did not visit Union, S.C., the scene of the crime. "When I was
writing the poems, I felt I just needed to know the details of the
case," he said. "I wasn't interested in the trial or the aftermath. I
just thought about those nine days--from the time Mr. Zero is born
until he evaporates after her confession."</TE>
<TE>   The poet said Mr. Zero doesn't have a voice because he is always
in Smith's head.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of the frustration we try to get across in the play,"
Eady said. "He is an invention. He can act as a kind of conscience,
to some degree, for Susan and needle her, but he can't talk to the
real world. So it's an odd marriage between the two of them.</TE>
<TE>   "His job--or his duty--is to get her to tell the truth, but once
he tells the truth, he's dead. On the other hand, he's immortal. He's
always around. He's always available to do the dirty work for our
subconscious."</TE>
<TE>   "When called, I come. My job is to get things done," proclaims Mr.
Zero in the play's opening moments. He is the unknown black intruder,
created out of a fantasy of fear, a fear that white society accepted
in Smith's case without much question.</TE>
<TE>   Paulus, who worked with Eady on "Running Man," read the poems last
year and immediately saw theatrical possibilities. "I was blown
away," the director said. "They struck me as so excitingly dramatic
because of the nature of the character who speaks through them. They
are monologue driven by the voice of Mr. Zero. What we have been
working on since then is how to further dramatize them."</TE>
<TE>   It was Eady who decided that Smith too should be a character in
the theater piece.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make it a duet between this white woman and this
black man and how they come to terms with their complicated
relationship," Paulus added. "Although Mr. Zero is a creation of
Susan's mind, he doesn't always behave like she wants him to behave.
He starts to rattle her mind--uncover parts of herself she didn't
know about.</TE>
<TE>   "Cornelius also had this wonderful idea of adding transcripts to
frame each scene. They provide a little narrative glue to what was
the actual event and how the community was receiving it."</TE>
<TE>   "Writing poetry is a slower craft than writing a play," Eady said.
"In theater, you have collaborators depending on you. You have to get
it done. I hope when audiences come to hear this piece they are not
hearing poetry, they are hearing dialogue. It's a theater piece with
music right now."</TE>
<TE>   "Brutal Imagination" tries to come to terms with what Smith
actually did.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to wrap your mind around how everyone was duped by
Susan Smith and how could she lie like that," Paulus said. "What is
she using to enable her to carry the lie? What was her eventual
breakdown? What happened in those nine days that made her confess? In
our fantasy, it is Mr. Zero."</TE>

<HD>Frederick Hammersley, From Abstract to Inventive Clarity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, Frederick Hammersley had his first solo show in a Los
Angeles gallery after an 18-year absence. His abstract paintings had
the presence of hidden treasures, secret masterpieces too boldly
conceived and sharply executed to remain undiscovered for long.</LD>
<LD>   Today, a second exhibition of the 82-year-old artist's hard-edged
oils on canvas and linen reveals how swiftly the times have changed.
At L.A. Louver Gallery, Hammersley's paintings have the presence of
talismans, touchstones for a couple of subsequent generations of
artists and viewers who are inspired by the quirky clarity of their
vision and the relentless inventiveness the Albuquerque-based painter
has brought to an extremely simplified format.</LD>
<LD>   Compositionally, nearly all of Hammersley's 20 mid-size works,
which he painted between 1962 and 1996, consist of a handful of
ingeniously interlocked squares and rectangles of solid color, with
the diagonal of an occasional triangle thrown in for good measure.
Most form stout symmetrical structures that exude the brick-by-brick
stability of architecture built to withstand the ravages of time.</LD>
<TE>   Hammersley's palette is even more basic. All but two of his
abstract images begin with black and white shapes. Five stop there,
creating figure-ground flip-flops that would be passe if they didn't
fuse visual stimulation and emotional serenity with such seeming ease
and killer precision.</TE>
<TE>   Nine include a third color. These battleship grays, flaming
red-oranges, desert-sky blues, deep forest greens and shoe-leather
browns put a kink in the carefully calibrated balance established by
each painting's composition, infusing it with tense dynamism. Their
crisp contours, high contrasts and saturated tints recall the
hand-held flags sailors use for silent ship-to-ship communication.
However, the only messages Hammersley's paintings transmit are
general: that pleasure and discipline sometimes go hand-in-glove, and
that intensity of focus sometimes opens onto soaring expansiveness.</TE>
<TE>   In "Double Dip" (1996) and "Connect Shun" (1976), he adds two
colors to his black and white foundation, orchestrating complicated
arrangements of planes that stamp themselves out in space while
holding their edges together. Ratcheting up the optical energy, this
pair of paintings makes Hammersley look like a Baroque artist in
Minimalist clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The only works in which three or more colors appear alongside
black and white are those in which swooping curves replace the
ruler-straight edges that dominate the show. "Object Lesson,"
"Child's Play" and "Pulse," all made in 1963, resemble doodles whose
empty spaces have been filled in with a rainbow of lovely shades,
including pink, tangerine, periwinkle and taupe.</TE>
<TE>   Your eye glides into these works smoothly. Riding their
roller-coaster contours at various speeds, you take in their
compositions bit by bit rather than all at once. Although they create
different sensations than Hammersley's geometric works, they have
been included because, like his other pieces, they were painted with
a palette knife. Not long after Hammersley made them, he began to use
brushes for his curvaceous organic forms, reserving the knife for
paintings whose shapes all have straight edges. A joy to behold, this
beautifully installed show follows the logic at work in each
painting: It breaks some rules, follows others and leaves viewers
free to decide what these differences mean.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Louver Gallery, 45 N. Venice Blvd., (310) 822-4955, through
Feb. 9. Closed Sundays and Mondays.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miniature World: To step into Matthew Ronay's first solo show is
to find yourself in a Lilliputian land where logic does a
loop-the-loop. At Marc Foxx Gallery, the 25-year-old Brooklyn-based
artist turns the world upside-down by transforming familiar things
into miniature stage sets. An abundance of stories dance off in every
direction. Some get your imagination to fly through the air with the
greatest of ease. Others tug against its stick-in-the-mud
stubbornness with a willfulness all their own.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what would happen if Rene Magritte and Joan Miro were
hired to design a McDonald's Playland for cats or hamsters, and
subcontracted the paint job to John Wesley. There's serious whimsy at
work in Ronay's enchanting sculptures, all of which are handcrafted
from various combinations of wood, paper, metal and string, then
painted in a crayon palette.</TE>
<TE>   All but five of his 22 multi-part pieces rest on the floor, rarely
rising above your ankles. The exceptions are "Pipe trick," G "Peacock
on cage cover," "Flaccid bee" and "Elephant on beach on overcast
day," which include components mounted low on the wall. "Wig n' hoop"
is a 3-D diptych that hangs from the rafters like a circus stunt
frozen at its most suspenseful moment.</TE>
<TE>   To stand in the gallery is to have a bird's-eye view of dozens of
such scenarios, stop-action dramas in which a lot has already
happened but the best is yet to come. For example, the
teeter-totter-like structure of "Fable on faux art deco diving board"
balances a fox's bushy tail against a plump cluster of purple grapes,
playing both off against a bird's nest that rests on a Y-shaped
branch, which would make any slingshot-coveting kid green with envy.
In Ronay's hands, Aesop's fable about sour grapes becomes a
springboard for metaphors that beget more and more metaphors, weaving
a web of potentially infinite complexity.</TE>
<TE>   People almost never appear. But plants, animals and inanimate
objects are filled with enough loopy symbolism to amuse even the
unimaginative. Ronay's works are also endowed with just the right
touch of deadpan pathos to redeem the world-weary.</TE>
<TE>   In "Magic trick," a houseplant sprouts a pair of hamburgers whose
meat is cooked when a nearby boom-box plays rap songs. In "A boating
incident," a crow perches on a tennis shoe's tip and stares intently
at a slice of Wonder Bread, on which rests an upended picnic table's
top and a big black dice. In others works, a hobo's sack acts as if
it were Evel Knievel; a fluffy bunny tries its luck at a steeple
chase; and a grasshopper escapes from the three musketeers (plus one
sidekick) by leaping over a pond and three shamrock-shaped trees.</TE>
<TE>   All is not fun and games in Ronay's vignettes, some of which
depict the aftermath of an avalanche, a futility-inspired fit, the
grim reaper's tiny scythe and an ice-cream cone that's fallen to the
ground. His charming art feels as if its core has been formed by the
silver linings he has found in rain clouds, after the storms have
subsided and the sun has begun once again to shine.</TE>

<TE>   Stuff of Collage: In her first solo show, Los Angeles artist Lecia
Dole-Recio takes collage far beyond its usual focus on cut-and-paste
content. Rather than using this piecemeal technique to create
unsettling juxtapositions between familiar images (which began with
Surrealism), she zeroes in on the actual stuff out of which collages
are made: paper, cardboard and tape.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Dole-Recio does for collage what Robert Ryman did for
abstract painting: strip it to its bare necessities to make it do
(rather than depict) the unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   At Richard Telles Fine Art, her six new works range in size from
that of an open book to that of an advertisement on a bus shelter.
Each consists of variously sized sections of notebook, butcher and
watercolor paper, as well as corrugated cardboard and translucent
vellum, which she has taped together in a manner that is neither
slapdash nor intended to please a perfectionist. A
good-enough-to-get-the-job-done quality suffuses her pieces, which
embody a love of things rough around the edges alongside an equal
desire for formal refinement.</TE>
<TE>   Into these mix-and-match grounds, Dole-Recio uses a razor-knife to
cut out dozens of imperfect squares, rectangles, diamonds, ovals and
ellipses. Treating each of these openings as an ad-hoc frame, she
then tapes a slightly smaller but similarly shaped piece of paper
into it. Row upon row of such openings form loose grids that drift
across the surfaces of her works.</TE>
<TE>   This painstaking process ensures that very few elements overlap
one another. By making everything occupy the same plane, Dole-Recio
suggests that no part of a work happened before any other. This
creates the impression that her abstract collages occupy a single
moment in time. More importantly, it stretches the present out in
space, luring viewers into a gravity-defying world of suspended
animation. Ragtag sophistication never looked so good.</TE>

<HD>This Contest Jumps Genres</HD>
<DH>Music* The rechristened South Coast Symphony's young-artist
competition isn't restricted to classical musicians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lots of orchestras hold concerto competitions to showcase young
artists. But Barry Silverman, founding conductor of the South Coast
Symphony (formerly Aliso Viejo Symphony), decided that was too
limiting.</LD>
<LD>   "Our competition is a performance competition," Silverman said.
"Students between 12 and 20 can try out on any instrument, but it's
also open to voice and jazz and musical-theater students. Our three
winners this year include a trumpeter, a violinist and a singer, who
is a music theater major."</LD>
<LD>   The three will be featured in the orchestra's "Young Stars of the
Future" program tonight at Coast Hills Church in Aliso Viejo.</LD>
<TE>   David Hall, 16, will play a movement from Hummel's Trumpet
Concerto in E flat. Violinist Han-sol Oh, 19, will play the first
movement from the Sibelius Violin Concerto. Soprano Krysta Rodriguez,
17, will sing songs by Stephen Sondheim and Stephen Schwartz.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Stacy Wetzel and Minor Wetzel, husband-and-wife
members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, will be the soloists in
Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola.</TE>
<TE>   The young artists' competition, sponsored by the John Nuveen &amp; Co.
investment firm, was open to students who live or study in Orange
County. There were 38 applications this year, the third year of the
contest.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the best draw we've had," Silverman said.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-three made the cut to perform in the live auditions, which
served essentially as the finals. The three winners received $1,000
each. They will also appear in recital Feb. 23 at Soka University in
Aliso Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Silverman started the orchestra under the name of that city in
1996, but changed it this season to South Coast Symphony.
Concertgoers may recall another local orchestra that performed under
that name from 1984 until 1992, when its board--declaring a fiscal
crisis--shut it down.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not my first choice, but members of the orchestra and the
board liked it," said Silverman who occasionally played timpani in
the original South Coast Symphony. "It fits better because our goal
basically is a larger identification with south county. We want to
relate to the 14 cities of south county, which we serve."</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra is a mix of union, nonunion and volunteer musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to increase the union membership each year, which
we've done," Silverman said. "The local union is happy with that.
Currently we have between 23 and 25 union players, depending on the
repertory."</TE>
<TE>   The new group operates on an annual budget of about $150,000.
"It's a shoestring, but we're working to double it."</TE>
<TE>   Concerts are held in Coast Hills Church, where subscriptions for
assigned seats were sold for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   "That doubled our subscription sales," said Silverman, who added
that the average attendance is about 1,000 people per concert.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still keeping ticket prices real cheap. No orchestra makes
it by ticket sales anyway. So let's get people in the door."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barry Silverman will lead the South Coast Symphony in a "Young
Stars of the Future" program [at 8 tonight at Coast Hills Church, 5
Pursuit, Aliso Viejo. $18, general; $15, students and seniors. (949)

sound incongruous. But Lewis manages to create stylish entertainment
out of her reactions to what happened that day.</LD>
<LD>   Or at least her supposed reactions. In the opening number, in
which she obscures her glamour with a yellow bathrobe, she claims
that the events of Sept. 11 caused her to seek comfort in food, which
made her balloon in size (cue the song "Fat as I Am"). But then she
sheds the robe, revealing through her casual black attire that the
weight problem was just a joke.</LD>
<TE>   She presses on with Sept. 11 references, however, and they reach
their high point in a wickedly funny number in which she imagines
herself playing the mother of Osama bin Laden in a "Gypsy"-like
musical. Tasteless? Perhaps. Sidesplitting? Definitely. Lewis
co-wrote this material, and the rest of her patter, with Mark Alton
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Lewis recalls a childhood friend who purportedly called her
on Sept. 11 with the news that a cousin who worked at a Boston
airport was being blamed for the terrorists' ability to penetrate
security. Lewis turns this into a biting caricature of her friend.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, no one said Lewis was tactful, and a few fellow African
American women celebrities are her juiciest targets. The quintessence
of this phenomenon is a hilarious encore, the title of which can't be
published in this newspaper for reasons of taste.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' wit is frequently aimed at herself as well. "I've done some
hateful things, but it was only to further my career," she says with
mock innocence. Her story of trying to climb Mt. Fuji is rife with
comic self-deprecation. From her hit show of almost a decade ago,
"The Diva Is Dismissed," she repeats a medley of brief poses from her
years on Broadway that sends up herself as well as musical theater
cliches.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis does get serious a few times during the evening. She repeats
her musical tribute to her grandmother from "The Diva Is Dismissed,"
and she sings a mellow rendition of Coleman Hawkins' "Be Grateful"
with her stellar accompanist, Grammy-winning Mervyn Warren. "I Know
Where I've Been," by the show's musical consultant, Marc Shaiman, and
technical supervisor, Scott Wittman, can be interpreted as a more
sobering reaction to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The self-absorption that she mocks is applied too thickly in film
clips from her acting roles (among others, she was in "What's Love
Got to Do With It?," "The Preacher's Wife" and the current Lifetime
series "Strong Medicine"). The initial clips are good for a few
laughs, but her final encore--in which she screens clips from her
2001 TV movie, "Jackie's Back"--is shamelessly promotional, related
to the imminent release of the DVD. It's hardly a grand finale, and
imparts a slightly sour taste to our exit from what is otherwise a
sharply uncompromising evening of cabaret.</TE>

<HD>Rockin' and Rollin' Out the Barrel</HD>
<DH>Music*  Polka players are trying to change their image,
with updates like electric guitars in place  of accordions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL SINGER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Polka rocks.</LD>
<LD>   More and more aficionados are infusing the music with rock 'n'
roll in hopes of showing a new generation that polka is not just Old
World music played on big accordions by men in polyester suits.</LD>
<LD>   "We're trying to bring to polka a more modern kind of excitement,
and to rock we are trying to bring more fun," said Don Hedeker,
founder of the Chicago-based Polkaholics.</LD>
<TE>   The band's "We Play Polkas on Guitar" is a theme song for a
growing group of rock/polka bands. It is played in the traditional
oom-pah oom-pah, two-step polka rhythm--but faster, louder and with
an electric guitar lead instead of an accordion.</TE>
<TE>   In bow ties and ruffled shirts, the Polkaholics rock through polka
favorites like "In Heaven There Is No Beer (That's Why We Drink It
Here)" and "Beer Barrel Polka."</TE>
<TE>   The music is partly a spoof of polka stereotypes, poking fun at
the traditional allegiance of polka, kielbasa and beer. For instance,
the Happy Schnapps Combo, based in Manitowoc, Wis., leads off its
1999 album "Beer Muscle" with a surf-party guitar polka called "We
Can Get Drunker Than Youse."</TE>
<TE>   But in groups like the Polkaholics; Brave Combo, from Denton,
Texas; and K!CK, from Oshkosh, Wis., the blend of rock and polka is
also a serious effort to broaden the reach of a traditional music
that has struggled to grab young audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Brave Combo won a polka Grammy Award for the 1999 album
"Polkasonic," which hews closely to traditional polka but with a
heavy electric guitar presence. The last track is a surreal version
of Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze," with the famous opening guitar riff
played on a saxophone.</TE>
<TE>   "We can bring new people in that would under no other
circumstances know this music," said Brave Combo founder and
guitarist Carl Finch. "We find that there are not a lot of
preconceived ideas about polka with the college kids and younger.
They haven't had any exposure to it. They don't know what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Polka has traditionally been a niche music market, and it is hard
to track sales because the performers often sell more music at
concerts than in stores.</TE>
<TE>   The late Frankie Yankovic, one of polka's biggest stars, has sold
97,000 albums in U.S. music stores since 1991, according to industry
tracker SoundScan. Brave Combo sold 74,000 over the same period. By
comparison, the Backstreet Boys have sold almost 29 million albums in
the United States since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Polka suffers in part because of factionalism among fans.</TE>
<TE>   There are separate polka halls of fame in Chicago and Cleveland,
each featuring stars of those cities' styles. The Chicago sound is
descended from Polish polka, while the Cleveland style is rooted in
Slovenian style.</TE>
<TE>   Although outsiders may be hard-pressed to tell the difference,
"there is a tremendous jealousy out there," said Steve Popovich,
president of Cleveland International Records.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this whole blinders thing--'If it's not Polish, it
doesn't matter,' or 'If it's not Slovenian, I won't listen to it,'"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Popovich is trying to break down those barriers. He has issued
albums by Yankovic and another polka star, Eddie Blazonczyk, as well
as the Brave Combo album that won the Grammy. In November, Popovich
and his son Steve Jr. started Shotglass Records with a six-song
rock/polka collection called "Extreme Polka."</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely do see polka on some kind of a rise," said Michelle
Jerabek, who plays guitar and saxophone for K!CK. "I see the younger
kids getting into it. The college kids around here in Oshkosh are
seeing us out there jamming in some public event and saying, 'That's
weird, but that's really cool.'"</TE>
<TE>   Jerabek and husband Dan, K!CK's accordion player, grew up playing
in traditional polka bands. Both in their 20s, they represent the new
generation of polka. Finch, 50, has been playing souped-up polka for
20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional polka audience is aging, said Richard March, a
folk and community arts specialist with the Wisconsin Arts Board.</TE>
<TE>   "In the previous generation, there were musicians and fans that
genetically received a particular style--the style of their ethnic
groups or the locality--and they developed a fierce loyalty to that
style," March said. "But now people are growing up in a more diverse
culture."</TE>
<TE>   The new music worries some older fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the bands are going kind of ultra-modern and it's hard
for the traditionalist to accept, and you can see their point because
they are trying to preserve their culture," said Tony Petkovsek, who
has hosted a polka radio show in Cleveland for 40 years, and
acknowledged that the new style has broad appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Linda "Big Lou" Seekins, of the band Big Lou's Polka Casserole in
San Francisco, said the marriage of rock and polka is natural.</TE>
<TE>   "Polka was rock 'n' roll when it started" in Europe in the 1800s,
she said. "It was a dance for the common people, and people were
touching. Parents disapproved of it and there were riots in the
streets."</TE>

<HD>Bare Souls and Explicit Talk in the Diverse 'A Few Gay Men'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writer and director Ronnie Larsen likes to talk about sex. No shock
if you're familiar with his "All-Male Peep Show" or "Making Porn."
While in New York, he placed an ad in search of men to talk about sex
and found 100 eager participants.</LD>
<LD>   These interviews are the basis of Larsen's new show, "A Few Gay
Men: True Stories From Real People About Sex, Love and Life," at the
Zephyr Theatre. If you blush and stammer at the mention of sex, this
isn't the show for you. Don't go with someone whose sexual secrets
you don't want to hear.</LD>
<LD>   Larsen, who plays himself--the interviewer--opens the show with
frank questions for the audience. One sexually adventurous guy
admitted he'd had every sexually transmitted disease except HIV.
Another revealed that he'd left his wife to find a monogamous
relationship with a man. Their stories are echoed within the show.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Kearns, as the conservative man concerned about the
"skewed messages" and "vulgar ads" in gay publications that present a
distorted view of gay men, and Jonathan Mundale, as his terminally
ill life partner, lead a well-rounded cast.</TE>
<TE>   Seth E. Cutler is sympathetic as the religiously conservative Jew
with odd fantasies. Gabriel Macen, Colin Martin and Corey Schaffer
represent a younger generation that indulges in a bit of hustling and
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Howell is a practical man who faithfully adheres to the safer
sex practices. Will Willoughby is a young man whose long-term
relationships have left him alone and HIV-positive.</TE>
<TE>   The material is by turns intriguing, erotically charged and
poignant, yet it could use some judicious editing. The repetition on
sex clubs, anonymous sexual encounters and hustling doesn't work as a
literary refrain within the current framework.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a show for the timid or homophobic. And if you're
looking for gratuitous nudity, this isn't for you either. Sex acts
are simulated, and a few shirts are doffed, but the men remained
clothed--it's their sexual souls that are naked.</TE>

<TE>   'West Assured' Pairs Up Oddball Westerns</TE>
<TE>   "Howdy, ma'am. This is the cowpoke who'll help you mosey to your
seat."</TE>
<TE>   This bit of Old West hokum--courtesy of a straight-faced usher in
a cowboy hat--sets the appropriate tone for "West Assured," the
umbrella title for two oddball westerns presented with irreverent
glee by the Group Repertory Theatre in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The two one-acts--M.Z. Ribalow's "Sundance," written in 1981, and
George Bernard Shaw's 1909 "The Shewing Up of Blanco Posnet"--both
mosey down the path of reflection on good and evil, morality and
immorality, life and death, subjects that, here, are better off not
taken too seriously.</TE>
<TE>   That's an easier job in Ribalow's rip-roaring "Sundance," directed
by Shelly Kurtz. Ribalow's fictional meeting between the West's
greatest outlaws--Jesse, the Kid, Hickok and Sundance himself--is
baldly satirical, peppered with as many deliberate anachronisms as a
Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon as each outlaw goes about arguing his
philosophy of murder.</TE>
<TE>   John R. Keller, as the wiry Jesse, is disturbingly, hilariously
cheerful as he presents the case for killing folks "because I like to
watch 'em die," and Jerome Guardino's barkeep is equally amusing in
his desperate attempt to enumerate the reasons he shouldn't be
killed.</TE>
<TE>   The Shaw play was banned in England upon publication in 1909
because of "alleged blasphemous content"--lots of downright shameful
talk about God--and, according to the program notes, it led to an
uprising among other playwrights of the era, challenging governmental
policies on censorship. While this lends the piece historical
significance, dramatically, this tale of how small-town hypocrites
deal with horse thieves seems pompous and shrill today.</TE>
<TE>   Still, under Chris Windfield's direction, the company attacks the
overwrought proceedings with admirable gusto, and it's satisfying to
see the outlaws of "Sundance" turn up here as members of the jury.</TE>

<TE>   Love Unrequited and Lost in 'The Day I Stood Still'</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Elyot's "The Day I Stood Still" is a contemplation about
obsessive, unrequited love that benefits greatly from nuanced
performances and Milton Justice's astute direction of the Page 93
production at the Elephant Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The play spans two decades, and Elyot begins in the middle.
Londoner Horace (Timothy McNeil) is surprised when his old friend
Judy (Susan Vinciotti) drops in with her boyfriend, Guy (Shaun
Baker). Horace is expecting company (Rick Peters), whose arrival sets
off an awkward moment. Horace and Judy were linked by the recently
deceased Jerry (Chris Carmack), with whom Judy had a son, Jimi
(Carmack).</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward a few years: The emotionally crushed Jimi seeks
refuge with Horace, leading Horace to recall his younger self
(Matthew Stravitz) and his first meeting with Judy (Meredith
Uccello).</TE>
<TE>   McNeil's emotionally stalled Horace is sympathetically drawn, with
nervous tics and ineffectual social skills. Horace wants to please
his hero, Jerry, and the shining admiration bordering on adulation is
echoed in Stravitz's younger version.</TE>
<TE>   Carmack's Jerry has the easy charm of a golden boy, whereas his
Jimi is a young man crushed at the ending of his first love affair
and unaware of his own physical beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Elyot has to draw too many parallels between the past and the
present, including one too many coincidences for a tidy ending.</TE>
<TE>   This seems to contradict the central message--that love isn't tidy
and endings aren't final unless you allow yourself to stagnate,
wishing for what can never be.</TE>

<LD>The Disney Channel takes the court at 8 tonight with a tall tale
based on the real-life Burge sisters, 6-foot-5 twins whose basketball
skills eventually elevated them to the pro ranks of the WNBA.</LD>
<LD>   Disney, which pioneered the twin-blond-teens concept back in 1961
by cloning Hayley Mills in "The Parent Trap," had a bigger casting
challenge in "Double Teamed." The lead actresses would have to be
very tall, good dribblers and, oh yeah, look exactly alike.</LD>
<LD>   The producers decided on Poppi Monroe (from the CBS miniseries
"The Last Don") as Heather and Annie McElwain ("Seventh Heaven") as
Heidi. A crash course in basketball, platform shoes and dyed hair
extensions took care of the rest. And although they don't look like
identical twins, they at least appear as if they could be sisters.</LD>
<TE>   The paint-by-the-numbers movie piles on the sports cliches as ably
as any male-oriented sports flick, and like such paintings, examining
the finished product too closely spoils some of the fun.</TE>
<TE>   The story, which takes place in Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes,
hinges on Dad's (Nick Searcy) rather unhinged efforts to secure
college sports scholarships for his girls at any cost, regardless of
the campaign's effect on their happiness. Mom (Mackenzie Phillips)
generally serves as referee during the family skirmishes.</TE>
<TE>   The desperate scholarship push seems a trifle odd inasmuch as the
girls are barely in their freshman year of high school, but chronic
money concerns compel the family to make many decisions.</TE>
<TE>   For the girls, there are rich yet envious teammates to contend
with, as well as untimely injuries and some sibling rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   But rest assured that a happy, Disney-style ending is a slam-dunk.</TE>

<HD>Relax, the IRS Is Calling</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service, that faceless, confounding federal
bureaucracy that annually rises from the dark depths of our winter
subconscious, has decided to reinstitute a random national tax audit
that will affect thousands of Americans. This is scary stuff because
next to nightmares about arriving for the first day of school to find
final exams being handed out, the worst dream for many of us is being
summoned for a tax audit of our 1999 return--and finding the desk
drawer full of tax files labeled 1994-1998, plus the 2000 folder.</LD>
<LD>   So relax and read these figures to put into perspective a
much-touted IRS crackdown that just happens to have been announced
when all those W2s and 1099s are arriving at our homes: According to
a very friendly agency spokeswoman, IRS numbers (unaudited) show that
last year 127,590,270 personal tax returns were filed. That's an
awful lot of 1040s, Line 37s and Combined Totals from Previous Lines.
This April's total is projected at 132 million. Of those, the IRS has
sternly announced a random audit of 49,000, a tiny football crowd.</LD>
<TE>   Eight thousand will be computer-checked, 9,000 filers might get a
letter with a stomach-sinking IRS return address and 30,000 returns
could involve meetings. But there will be only 2,000 line-by-line
audits, the filer sitting at some agent's desk with his happy family
photos looking on. And you say, "Well, that's certainly a
nice-looking family you have! Would you like to see pictures of my
poor family?"</TE>
<TE>   The new audit is called the National Research Program, which
sounds like a CIA front. What it resembles is highway troopers
parking empty patrol cars in interstate medians on Friday evening of
Memorial Day weekend. Just to be on the safe side, you slow down, at
least enough to see whether there's an occupant. Remember, too, this
is an election year. The IRS doesn't want to be a target of House
incumbents who will be voting on the next IRS budget come fall or of
any pol looking for a whipping boy.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, even a statistically vanishing chance of an audit will shape
up some cheaters. Some individuals do, shall we say, minimize taxes,
though rarely on a scale of a certain Houston energy trading company.
Few families have nearly 900 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS estimates total 1998 tax cheating at $278 billion, a
little under $1,000 per American. (Cheating figures for 1999 are
apparently still being totaled). A while back the IRS began requiring
a Social Security number with the name of each child deduction;
suddenly, 7 million American children vanished, a mass abduction
never fully explained. But that's another editorial.</TE>

<HD>A Blind Eye to Health Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indications are that health care will be the buzz of the chat show
circuit this weekend. Anyone who believes that a decent society must
take care of its children might watch the talking heads closely and
ask: Who's cynically spinning and who has a solution?</LD>
<LD>   Lately, most Beltway politicians have either been ignoring health
care or using it as a hammer to knock down opponents in an election
year. Take, for example, the way in which GOP leaders and some
Democrats swiftly excoriated Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) after
he suggested this week that $350 billion of President Bush's
$1.3-trillion tax cut be postponed so that money could be found to
help Americans get health care. Listen this weekend for harrumphing
that Kennedy is dividing the Democrats and ending the era of
bipartisanship--not to mention raising taxes.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Kennedy's specific plan to trim future tax breaks for
families earning more than $130,000 a year may not be politically
feasible. But his call for Bush and the Congress to pare down at
least some tax breaks makes a lot of sense. So do some other bold
ideas for providing proper health care for the needy.</LD>
<TE>   If the politicians screaming bloody murder would get outside the
self-referential Beltway and talk to GOP and Democratic governors,
they might be startled to find a growing prairie revolution in favor
of at least one reform: helping states expand the Children's Health
Insurance Program to cover not just children from poor, working
families but also their parents. This is more than a bleeding-heart
entitlement for adults. Study after study shows that when low-income
parents have health insurance, they're far more likely to make sure
their kids get care too.</TE>
<TE>   Governors see the suffering of those who go untreated. They
realize that an expanding uninsured population is putting already
precarious hospitals on the brink of bankruptcy and forcing counties
like Los Angeles to risk insolvency just to keep their emergency
rooms open.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months, Bush himself has approved requests from
the governors of six states to expand the program to cover adults. He
has not, however, set aside money to help struggling states afford
the expansion. On the contrary, last October he actually proposed
taking $11 billion out of the existing children's program and using
it to provide health coverage to workers displaced by the September
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps newly enlightened Beltway pols could set him straight. As
a presidential candidate, Bush deemed health care access for all
working families ''a goal worthy of our nation.'' But in recent
months, as more doors than ever have slammed closed on those
Americans, he and many of his Washington colleagues seem to have
forgotten that promise. Instead, they are posturing for the coming
election, using glib caricatures to blame one another.</TE>
<TE>   Watch for that on the political talk shows on television this
weekend. Then pick up your pen or telephone and let these politicians
know what you think of "leaders" who dodge responsibility for
something as crucial as health care.</TE>

<HD>Offshore Oil Fight, Forever</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new struggle between California and the Bush administration over
offshore oil drilling illustrates that great environmental battles
are never won forever. Victory lasts merely until the next challenge
comes along and the fight begins anew.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush and his energy advisors should know that taking on
California over offshore oil is bound to be a losing proposition.
Californians--Republicans as well as Democrats--agreed two decades
ago that there would be no more wells drilled off the coast, whether
within the three-mile jurisdiction of the state or in federal waters
beyond.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it was the Clinton administration that touched off this
latest flap, but in relatively muted fashion. The Department of the
Interior moved to allow companies to drill in 36 tracts leased
between 1968 and 1984 off the coasts of Ventura, Santa Barbara and
San Luis Obispo counties. The companies normally have five years in
which to drill on their leases, but extensions were repeatedly
granted.</LD>
<TE>   The administration of Gov. Gray Davis challenged the Interior
Department in federal court, arguing that no drilling could proceed
without state approval. This argument was based on a federal law that
allows the state to review the coastal impacts caused by drilling.
The state won in federal district court, but now the Bush
administration has decided to take the case to the appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Interior's Minerals Management Service made this
incredibly condescending statement last week to The Times' Kenneth R.
Weiss: "We want to clarify that all this is in federal waters. People
don't understand that we are not talking about something smack dab up
against the coast."</TE>
<TE>   Pardon us, but Californians know exactly what's involved. We
learned that lesson well in 1969 when that Union Oil platform, which
was in federal waters, blew out and caused a massive oil slick that
wound up smack dab on the beach. That is exactly why there is a
long-term federal moratorium against any new oil leases in both state
and federal waters. Pete Wilson as governor was instrumental in that,
and the elder President Bush agreed to it. Unfortunately, the ban was
not applied to those 36 leases.</TE>
<TE>   The George W. Bush administration should reconsider its appeal and
compensate the oil companies for legitimate expenses involved.
Otherwise, we have every confidence that the 9th District Court of
Appeal will settle this argument in California's favor, perhaps even
forever.</TE>

<HD>Freeway Offramp Exit Numbers Are Right On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's about time Caltrans saw the light and decided to put exit
numbers on our freeways (Jan. 16). Here are some other things it
needs to do: 1) Make the mile marker signs on the side of the freeway
more visible; e.g., reflective green--just like almost every other
state. This can easily be combined with the emergency call boxes,
which now have a secret code showing the mileage from the county
line.</LD>
<LD>   2) Post a telephone number to call for highway obstacles, hazards
and problems that do not qualify as emergencies (Oregon does this
now).</LD>
<LD>   3) In less-populated areas (I-5 and U.S. 395), post signs with
radio station frequencies for broadcast of traffic and weather
advisories.</LD>

<TE>   It is wonderful to see that California has finally caught up to
the rest of the free world and is going to number the exit signs on
the freeways. We are so behind everyone else it is pathetic.</TE>
<TE>   I go to visit my daughter in Washington state and have no problem
finding my exits; why we are so far behind everyone else is beyond my
imagination. Thank you, Caltrans, and whoever else is responsible for
this great idea. Here's hoping they don't have to do a study that
will take three years before implementing it.</TE>

<HD>Davis Should Get Credit for Enacting Tax Relief</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis Pledges No Tax Hikes in State Speech," Jan. 9: Every dollar
of the $4.3 billion in tax relief the governor mentioned in his State
of the State address was enacted during his first three years in
office.</LD>
<LD>   The largest of these measures is a $2.7-billion reduction in the
vehicle license fee. The prior administration had enacted a reduction
in the fee but made the actual reduction contingent on growth in
budget reserves. Gov. Gray Davis eliminated this hurdle and increased
the amount of this tax cut. Without this action, Californians would
not have received this additional tax relief.</LD>
<LD>   Other tax relief measures enacted during the Davis administration
include: an increase in assistance for senior homeowners and renters;
tax credits for teachers; a refundable child care credit; an increase
in the research and development credit; an increase in health
insurance deductions for the self-employed; exemptions for various
agricultural items; increases for net operating losses; a long-term
care credit; relief for graduate students; a credit for land
donations; and credits for solar and wind energy.</LD>
<TE>   All of the above, worth $4.3 billion to California taxpayers, were
enacted under Davis.</TE>

<LD>Re "Anti-Communist Reich Given State Dept. Post," Jan. 12:</LD>
<LD>   Otto Juan Reich, President Bush's recess appointment as assistant
secretary of State for Western Hemisphere affairs, is referred to as
an "anti-Communist." I hope this is meant as a compliment.</LD>
<LD>   The article states that opponents to his appointment see it as a
"bouquet to the Cuban Americans in Florida." Such opponents
apparently take issue with the legitimate anger of those people who
see Cuba being operated as a police state by dictator Fidel Castro,
where democratic elections are not allowed, basic human rights are
denied and dissenters are harassed and imprisoned. Defenders of the
Castro regime point to what they claim is a good educational and
health system in Cuba. But if this is the standard by which to judge
a society then slavery could be justified if the slaves received
similar benefits.</LD>

<LD>Re "No Special Prosecutor on Enron," Commentary, Jan. 16: Excuse me,
Samuel Dash, but the attorney general has recused himself from the
case, as well as the U.S. attorney and his staff in Houston. John
Ashcroft still heads the Department of Justice, though.</LD>
<LD>   I can't think of a stronger case for an independent counsel than
this one.</LD>
<LD>   As for Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's statements (Jan. 14), I
can't think of a stronger case for stopping the deregulation of the
energy markets. Look at the airlines and the savings and loan
debacle. Republicans think a free market is where you can fleece the
public but, when your business gets into trouble, ask your buddies in
Washington to bail you out (with our money).</LD>
<TE>   I'd still like the FERC to pursue an investigation about how Enron
and its cronies manipulated the electricity markets here in
California and elsewhere, but that is highly unlikely with Ken Lay's
handpicked henchmen on the board. Imagine, an anti-regulation zealot
in charge of the regulatory agency!</TE>

<TE>   The Andersen accounting firm deserves our thanks for firing its
lead auditor for Enron ("Andersen Fires Executive Who Oversaw Enron
Audit," Jan. 16). By so doing, it has relinquished its power to
prevent David Duncan from letting the authorities and, more
important, us know just who really authorized the destruction of
Enron-related documents, as well as giving us an important part of
the inside story relating to this whole malodorous business. Surely,
this fired lead auditor would have no reason whatsoever to take the
rap for Andersen and Enron's higher-ups.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lest we get lost in a quagmire of political bickering and forget
to address flaws that made the Enron debacle possible, please
remember this: Enron's growth and prosperity happened during the
Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-five percent of the U.S. Senate accepted campaign funds
from Enron. California's deregulation passed the state Legislature
unanimously. Enron lobbied for favorable tax and regulatory treatment
with the Bush administration. Enron was the beneficiary of favorable
tax and regulatory treatment during the Clinton administration. In
short, there is plenty of mud to be slung at both parties.</TE>
<TE>   But if that fight consumes us, we may miss the opportunity to
learn what legal loopholes need closing; what additional transparency
in disclosure is required; why Wall Street analysts continued to tout
the stock until it fell off the cliff; and what accounting rule
changes need to be made to either eliminate or clearly disclose the
extent and meaning of "off-balance-sheet" financing.</TE>

us all.</TE>

<HD>College Athletes Are Not Exploited</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William F. Devine Jr.'s rant about college athletes being shackled
and exploited is wrong on the facts and wrong on the law. Last time I
checked, an education at Stanford or Notre Dame can cost well over
$100,000. If the "discrimination" is so rampant, then why hasn't any
college athlete sued on this ground? The simple answer is because
there isn't any.</LD>
<LD>   What Devine conspicuously ignores is that if Stanford elected to
pay a football player such as Luke Powell, for example, then it would
be in violation of Title IX if it didn't pay its female athletes the
same amount. Further, Devine also conveniently forgets that college
athletes are entitled to a Pell grant, which pays up to $3,500 per

<LD>Like President Bush, I almost fell to the floor (in laughter) as I
read your hilarious report ("World Press Tries to Unknot Tale of Bush

<LD>   With an official account as loopy, nay, twisted (forgive the puns)
as this, one wonders what the real story (the one they're covering
up--wink, wink) might be. As an avid "West Wing" watcher, I must
admit that relapsing, remitting multiple sclerosis crossed my mind.
Thanks for the comic relief.</LD>

<HD>Misguided Tax Break for Film Industry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am having a problem squaring Gov. Gray Davis' intention to offer
some form of tax break for the movie industry with his recent speech
pledging no new tax hikes ("Tax Break Being Sought for Filming," Jan.
11). It seems to me that taking taxpayer money out of the general
pool to give to the movie industry is much the same thing.</LD>
<LD>   Far more offensive, though, is a realization of what this
indicates about his priorities. He ought to be more concerned about
increased salaries (or more tax breaks) for aspiring teachers,
allowing and encouraging them to become educators. The same is true
for the nursing profession. Does the governor not realize the serious
shortage of nurses that could easily grow to dangerous proportions as
the deficit of young, would-be nurses increases, creating an
expanding void as an older nurse population retires? How about
creating monetary inducements to reward and ensure an adequate number
of nurses? Does he really think that making the movie industry a more
lucrative business in California is more important than the nurturing
and rewarding of genuinely noble work?</LD>

<LD>Since "Singapore's government is one of the most authoritarian" in
East Asia, why is "the existence of a terrorist group . . . a shock
to many" ("Singapore Says Terror Ring Planned Attacks on Americans,"
Jan. 12)? History, including recent history, has shown that terrorism
is most likely to thrive in authoritarian and totalitarian societies.</LD>
<LD>   The Middle Eastern and South Asian countries that spawned the
nightmare of today's terrorism are all authoritarian to some degree;
with no other outlet, extremism becomes attractive to the powerless.
A country that "limits free speech and political opposition" is
creating an environment in which violent extremist solutions have
appeal to many. This is exactly the sort of thing that this country's
founding fathers sought to avoid, and why they attached so much
importance to personal freedoms.</LD>

<HD>Tattoos Draw Pictures of Life in L.A. Gangs</HD>
<DH>The designs can recount prison sentences, personal losses
and criminal affiliations, and often provide clues to police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To law enforcement officers, gang tattoos are like modern-day
hieroglyphics.</LD>
<LD>   Gang detectives study the ink drawings, looking for everything
from clues about crime suspects to signs that a youth may be unhappy
at home.</LD>
<LD>   "Tattoos are more popular in general, so now you see them even
more with gang members," said Officer Richard Duran, a gang expert in
the Los Angeles Police Department's Central Division. "Now you see
really young kids are more tattooed, like 10-year-olds. That's the
current trend."</LD>
<TE>   Some tattoos found on gang members are well-known. Authorities say
the symbol of a black hand with a prominent letter M on the palm
indicates affiliation with the Mexican Mafia. Three dots in the form
of a triangle placed somewhere on the hand mean "Mi Vida Loca" or "My
Crazy Life."</TE>
<TE>   Prison towers with clocks or numbers might reflect the years
someone was incarcerated or "killing time," said gang Det. De Waine
Fields of the LAPD's Hollenbeck Division.</TE>
<TE>   Even seemingly artistic designs can give detectives clues. Women
on the neck are "classic gang tattoos," said Det. Gabe Barboza.</TE>
<TE>   Barboza said one neck tattoo popular with gang members is the
image of a woman with flowing hair, striking eyes, large breasts and
a slim waist. Designs also may cover markings left by drug use, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Duran said gang members used to start getting tattoos in their
late teens. In recent years, more have seemed to be getting their
first ink markings as preteens, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tattoos could give parents insight about their children's
activities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a 12-year-old who had [gang symbols] on the back of her
neck, on her elbow and on her stomach," Duran said. "Her mother was
oblivious to her being in a gang. I think she was in denial, like
most parents."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said each tattoo can have several meanings. A teardrop
near the eye can mean years of hard time in prison or represent
fellow gang members who have been killed.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some tattoos have nothing to do with gangs, and simply
being in a gang is not a crime, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "A tattoo [can be] just pride in the neighborhood," Fields said.
"I don't automatically think a guy is a gangbanger just because he
has tattoos. You have to look at the totality of the circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Lessons Learned on the Street</TE>
<TE>   Joey, a 25-year-old gang member from the San Fernando Valley who
said he's been in and out of prison, said he was 13 when he got his
first tattoo. He had long admired gang members with "eye-popping"
tattoos on their chests.</TE>
<TE>   The words "Trust No Man" were pricked into his skin to remind him
of the first lesson he learned from his mentors. "I still don't trust
nobody. Everyone I've trusted has stabbed me in the back," he said.
"Not my homies though."</TE>
<TE>   With each passing year, Joey gained tattoos that let him use his
body as a canvas to tell his life. Joey says growing up with
drug-addicted parents made him turn to friends on the street for
support.</TE>
<TE>   "I live life as a warrior because of what I believe in," he said.
"I believe in where I'm from. At any moment I'm ready to die for it.
That's why I'm all tattooed up, to let everyone know."</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the presence of numerous tattoos representing gang life
shows that "the gang is pretty much their whole life," said Thomas
Ward, a lecturer of anthropology at USC.</TE>
<TE>   That devotion is a reason tattoos become a form of expression and
identity that is irresistible even if gang members know police keep
track of them, Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're saying to the world, 'This is who I am.' To the cops
they're saying they're down, deeply committed. They're in it for
life, and 'There's nothing you can do about it.'" Ward said. "To the
rest, they're saying 'I'm a gang member and I am to be feared. If you
don't respect me, at least you will fear me.'"</TE>
<TE>   Messages Based on Personal Experience</TE>
<TE>   Many tattoos are based on experiences. The right side of Joey's
head has the most personal tattoo on his body. A pair of feminine
eyes are crying, with the words "Only God Knows Why" written above
the haunting gaze.</TE>
<TE>   "My younger brother was shot in '98. He got shot in Boyle
Heights," Joey said. "There were mothers and ladies crying. I know
everyone had the same question: 'Why?' That's where I got the idea
[for the tattoo]. Only God knows why."</TE>
<TE>   The more distinguishable tattoos help police find suspects, said
homicide Det. Rick Peterson. Witnesses are able to remember and
identify people more easily when the tattoos are prominent, such as
on the face or neck, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Usually hard-core gang members get very visible tattoos, said
Father Gregory J. Boyle, director of Homeboy Industries, a jobs
program for former and current gang members in Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Boyle said prominent tattoos on the face may mean the bearers
don't care what other people think. They have no feelings about
getting arrested for breaking the law, about being identified, about
the future, about life, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One gang member once walked into the office with an obscenity
tattooed on his forehead.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd effectively given up," Boyle said.</TE>
<TE>   Ward said "[Gang members] with more tattoos can be saying, 'I need
help. Rescue me from myself' is the subtext. They could be looking
for support."</TE>

<HD>Camilo Jose Cela, 85; Spanish Author Won Nobel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Camilo Jose Cela, a flamboyant novelist from Spain who won the 1989
Nobel Prize in literature with his crude, straightforward writing
style, died Thursday. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Cela died from chronic heart disease, Hospital Cemtro in Madrid
said.</LD>
<LD>   With his first novel, "The Family of Pascual Duarte," Cela became
the leader of an uncommonly plain-spoken style of writing called
tremendismo that clashed with the lyricism of previous Spanish
writers.</LD>
<TE>   Spanish novelist and essayist Francisco Umbral said Cela's death
represented the "disappearance of the last great Spanish writer,
creator of fables, of language, of words, with a prodigious capacity
of expression."</TE>
<TE>   A bon vivant known in Spain for his flamboyant lifestyle, Cela's
writing tended to show a darker side of life. He drew from his
experiences in the Spanish Civil War for many of his stories, which
were often violent and gruesome.</TE>
<TE>   He was recruited as a private to fight on the side of the rebel
forces led by future dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, but was released
after being seriously wounded. He later published an anti-fascist
magazine that became a forum for opposition to the 36-year Franco
dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   "The Family of Pascual Duarte" was first published in Argentina in
1942 because it was deemed too violent and crude for Spain at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   It tells the story in the language of a rural, uneducated man who
commits a series of brutal murders without really knowing why and
ends up being executed. It often is credited with creating a sort of
literary vanguard, both in Spain and Latin America, in the years
immediately following the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Another well-known work, "The Hive," published in 1951, takes
place in the cold, depressing postwar years and depicts starving
writers who would sit for hours during the winter in Madrid's
literary cafes.</TE>
<TE>   When Cela was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1989, the
Royal Swedish Academy cited him for "rich and intensive prose, which
with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision of man's
vulnerability."</TE>
<TE>   It said "The Family of Pascual Duarte" was the most popular work
of fiction in Spanish since Miguel Cervantes' masterpiece "Don
Quixote" was published nearly 400 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Cela greeted the honor with aplomb, saying it could just as easily
have gone to many other Spanish writers. "Life is like a game of
tennis," he told reporters, "and this time I won."</TE>
<TE>   He also spoke of what the prize might mean for his legacy, and how
he'd like to be remembered. Using the crude language common to his
fiction, Cela said he would like this epitaph: "Here lies someone who
tried to screw his fellow man as little as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Spanish father and English mother, Cela was born in
1916 in comfortable surroundings in the town of Iria Flavia in the
northwestern region of Galicia.</TE>
<TE>   Over his lifetime, Cela produced more than 70 works, including
essays, poems and travel books, and 10 novels. But at home, he was
better known for his love of food, travel and women. He enjoyed
touring his country in a Rolls-Royce and sometimes reminisced about
fellow writer Ernest Hemingway.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to a lot of bullfights together. He was a great author
and a great friend," Cela said in Stockholm in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Cela was the fifth Spaniard to win the Nobel in literature, but
the first novelist. Previous winners from Spain included two poets
and two playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, two years after the death of Franco, Vicente Aleixandre,
an obscure poet from Spain's prewar literary generation, received the
Nobel Prize for literature. Fellow poet Juan Ramon Jimenez received
the award in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's first literary Nobel laureate was playwright Jose
Echegaray, who won in 1904. Playwright Jacinto Benavente won the
award in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   At his death, Cela was involved in an unresolved court battle with
an obscure Spanish writer, Carmen Formoso Lapido, who accused him of
plagiarism. She said a novel she wrote in the early 1990s served as
the basis for Cela's "La Cruz de San Andres," which won Spain's
prestigious Planeta Award in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Cela is survived by a son and his wife, Marina Castano, who was
his literary aide and whom Cela called his muse.</TE>
<TE>   Burial is scheduled for today in his hometown in Galicia.</TE>

<HD>Pitt Proposes Accounting Rules</HD>
<DH>Regulation: The SEC chief also reiterates his reasons for
not recusing himself in Enron case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's top securities regulator forcefully defended himself
Thursday from critics who question his impartiality in the probe of
Enron Corp.'s collapse and outlined a plan to bolster oversight of
the accounting profession in an effort to prevent similar disasters.</LD>
<LD>   Harvey L. Pitt, the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said a new private-sector organization, dominated by
executives and experts from outside the accounting industry, should
be created to enforce ethical and professional standards. The
disciplinary body would be overseen by the SEC, which would retain
jurisdiction over potential legal violations, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Now, most disciplinary matters in the accounting profession are
handled by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, a
private professional association.</LD>
<TE>   Pitt also called for reform of the current practice of peer review
of accounting firms, with stronger and more frequent monitoring of
professional standards. He stressed that his ideas were in an "early"
stage.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's news conference underscored the steep challenges he faces.
His agency is leading the investigation into alleged accounting and
auditing irregularities in the startling fall of the energy-trading
company from Wall Street titan to bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   But before Pitt was nominated to the SEC post by President Bush,
he was a high-powered lawyer for many accounting firms and
institutions with a deep stake in any new regulations the SEC may
propose.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft pulled himself out of
the Justice Department's probe out of concern that Enron's political
contributions to his failed 2000 Senate campaign would create the
appearance of a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Pitt dismissed critics who say he, too, should recuse
himself from the Enron-Andersen probe, depicting himself as--first
and foremost--a public advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "When I left the private sector and came to the government I
traded a group of wonderful clients for the most wonderful client of
all--public investors," Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that he has participated only once in the SEC
probe--voting to authorize it--and that any questions about his
future actions in the case were "hypothetical." Without commenting
directly on the case, he also said that the SEC would look harshly on
anyone who attempted to obstruct its inquiries. Andersen has
acknowledged destroying documents pertaining to Enron--an action that
has drawn the wrath of congressional investigators.</TE>
<TE>   But critics continued to call on Pitt to step aside.</TE>
<TE>   "This is pretty obvious," said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.). "He
has to recuse himself. I don't know how he can do anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Dorgan, the chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on
consumer affairs, is leading one of many congressional inquiries into
Enron. Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), a former Wall Street executive and
member of the Senate Banking Committee, also has called for Pitt's
recusal. So has the government watchdog group Common Cause.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the criticism, Pitt has broad backing in Congress. The
Democrat-led Senate confirmed him on a voice vote  in August after a
hearing that yielded little controversy. But that was before the
scandal broke, and Enron sought protection from creditors on Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Given the new questions raised about Enron and its auditors, the
Senate is likely to give close scrutiny to two more Bush nominees to
the SEC, both executives in Big Five accounting firms. Last month
Bush tapped Paul Atkins of PricewaterhouseCoopers  and Cynthia
Glassman of Ernst &amp; Young to fill vacancies on the  commission.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the administration on many levels--from the White House
on down--facing questions about its close ties to corporate America,
Pitt is seeking to seize the offensive.</TE>
<TE>   The bearded, bespectacled chairman, 56, noted Thursday that he
began his career at the SEC as general counsel in the 1970s, and said
he may well end it there.</TE>
<TE>   In between he was a partner in Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp;
Jacobson, a New York law firm. He has represented the country's
largest accounting firms and argued successfully against proposals to
tighten industry controls.</TE>
<TE>   Although he acknowledged that action to boost confidence in public
accounting and auditing is "immediate goal No. 1," Pitt said, "It is
meaningless to try to brand an entire profession, when what we really
need to do is focus on the substance."</TE>
<TE>   Recent embarrassments involving Big Five firms have led to calls
for reform of the accounting profession. In addition to involvement
in the Enron collapse, Andersen agreed to pay $110 million to settle
an accounting fraud lawsuit involving appliance maker Sunbeam Corp.
last May. A month later, it agreed to pay $7 million to settle a
lawsuit over audits of Houston-based Waste Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the SEC censured another Big Five firm, KPMG, for
investing in one of its clients while working as an auditor--a
violation of auditor independence rules.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Pitt's proposal drew criticism from some quarters
and cautious approval from others.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, a private-sector organization will be
largely dependent on the accounting industry for its survival,"
Corzine said. "That is unacceptable. We shouldn't rely on the fox to
guard the henhouse. It's time for the SEC to assume this
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John J. LaFalce of New York, top Democrat on the House
Financial Services Committee, called Pitt's proposal "a first
incremental step." LaFalce warned that further action would be
necessary to restore confidence in the financial disclosure system,
"which rests heavily on the professional integrity and accountability
of accountants and auditors."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), the committee's chairman, said
Pitt was "right to begin his own efforts to reevaluate the regulatory
structure of the accounting industry." Oxley promised more talks with
Pitt on the issue.</TE>

<HD>Peers Honor 7 Marines Who Died in Accident in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Memorial: More than 1,500 mourners, including Gov. Davis,
gather for ceremony at San Diego base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In a somber and tearful ceremony, the seven Marines killed in a plane
crash last week in Pakistan were remembered Thursday as patriots "who
answered the call of their nation with honor, courage and
commitment."</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,500 people, including Gov. Gray Davis and U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, attended a memorial service at Marine Corps Air
Station Miramar to honor the seven killed when their KC-130 Hercules
crashed into a mountain while attempting a night landing.</LD>
<LD>   "Our fellow Marines were so dear to us, and the pain is very
great," said Lt. Col. Carl Parker, his voice breaking. "We will carry
a part of each of them inside of us. We have a solemn responsibility
to emulate the wonderful example they set for us."</LD>
<TE>   Outside the base theater, where the memorial was held, the Marine
Corps had placed seven pairs of black boots, seven M-16 rifles, seven
helmets and seven wreaths. The display was guarded by two Marines in
dress blues.</TE>
<TE>   The crash was the biggest loss of life among U.S. military
personnel during the war on terrorism that began in October. The
plane was part of Miramar-based Marine Aerial Refueler Transport
Squadron 352, known as the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   "It really doesn't matter what is said today," said a tearful Sgt.
Ricky L. Poon, eulogizing Sgt. Nathan Hays, one of the seven. "What
really matters is that we remember them tomorrow for what they did
for our nation."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not determined a cause for the crash, but
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said there is no evidence that the
plane was struck by groundfire. Taliban and Al Qaeda forces across
the border in Afghanistan have shoulder-launched Stinger missiles and
have fired at other craft, although there no reports of U.S. planes
being hit.</TE>
<TE>   "The price of liberty and justice is often paid for with the lives
of our nation's youth," said Rear Adm. Louis V. Iasiello, Marine
Corps head chaplain.</TE>
<TE>   Killed in the crash were Capt. Matthew Bancroft, 29, of Redding,
the pilot; Capt. Daniel G. McCollum, 29, of Richland, S.C., the
co-pilot; Gunnery Sgt. Stephen L. Bryson, 36, of Montgomery, Ala.;
Staff Sgt. Scott N. Germosen, 37, of New York City; Lance Cpl. Bryan
P. Bertrand, 23, of Coos Bay, Ore.; Sgt. Jeannette L. Winters, 25, of
Du Page, Ill.; and Hays, 21, of Lincoln, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Winters was a radio operator based at Miramar. The six others were
part of the plane's air crew. A replacement plane with an
all-volunteer crew was dispatched to Afghanistan late last week from
Miramar.</TE>
<TE>   With sobbing relatives in the audience Thursday, the Marines were
called loyal friends and dedicated Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "We honor you and we swear by the love we have in our hearts for
you, we will happily pick up your torch and we will never forget
you," Capt. Kent Kroeker said in his eulogy to Bancroft.</TE>
<TE>   Gunnery Sgt. Randolph Richter, speaking of Bertrand, said, "We
will prevail over our enemies and right this terrible injustice. And
when we do, let us claim it as a tribute to our liberty and to the
crew of Raider 04 [the plane's number] who died to defend it."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Richard Roberts said of McCollum, "Dan was a brother to us
all and he is an American hero."</TE>
<TE>   Gunnery Sgt. Michael Lamar said of Germosen, who had received a
Purple Heart after being wounded in Lebanon, "We were so lucky to
have Scott. He was a gift from God and now he is a gift to God."</TE>
<TE>   The KC-130 was on a fuel-carrying mission, which may have
contributed to the explosion and fire reported by eyewitnesses,
officials said. The aging aircraft is designed to carry troops and
cargo and provide in-flight refueling for helicopters and fixed-wing
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "Our illusion of invincibility has been shattered," said Parker,
the squadron's commanding officer.</TE>

<HD>$4 Billion Sought in PG&amp;E Claim</HD>
<DH>Energy: The utility blames state for losses, citing a law
passed during last year's crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. filed a $4-billion damage claim Thursday
against the state of California, alleging that a law passed during
the energy crisis prevented the utility from selling power generated
by its hydroelectric and nuclear facilities at federally established
market rates.</LD>
<LD>   In drawing its latest battle line with the state, PG&amp;E said the
state failed to meet its obligations under AB 1890, the California
deregulation law passed in 1996. Part of the law required that output
from generation facilities retained by utilities would become
federally regulated.</LD>
<LD>   The state changed the rules, PG&amp;E said in a filing with the state
claims board, when it adopted AB 6X a year ago and blocked the
utility from selling its power at rates determined by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.</LD>
<TE>   "The state breached its obligations and prevented the company from
recovering billions of dollars in value from the generating
facilities," Roger Peters, PG&amp;E general counsel and senior vice
president, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E said it held up its end of the bargain struck by utilities
and the state under the deregulation law by, among other things,
selling most of its generation assets.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining assets--mainly a network of hydroelectric facilities
and the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant--were valued at $4.1 billion by
the company in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deregulation law, the company said, that valuation
should have triggered a shift from regulation by the state Public
Utilities Commission to FERC, where it could have received a higher
price.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, AB 6X was passed by the Legislature and signed by the
governor last January. The company took no position on the bill. At
the time, PG&amp;E was purchasing much of the power for more than it
could charge its customers and was falling into debt.</TE>
<TE>   The claim came just a week after the state attorney general sued
PG&amp;E's parent, PG&amp;E Corp., alleging that it siphoned off billions of
dollars from the utility. The state and PG&amp;E also are fighting in
federal Bankruptcy Court, where PG&amp;E has proposed a reorganization
plan that would preempt many state laws.</TE>
<TE>   The state PUC called the claim a "frivolous act of desperation"
and an attorney general's office spokeswoman said, "This looks like
another PG&amp;E ploy to escape state regulatory oversight."</TE>

<LD>A condemned inmate scheduled to be executed Jan. 29 lost a last-ditch
effort to remove Gov. Gray Davis from considering his clemency
petition.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge declined Stephen Anderson's request, saying Davis'
views are immaterial because such a hearing is not constitutionally
required.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson's attorneys claimed it is certain Davis will reject the
convicted murderer's bid to commute his sentence to life without
parole. The Board of Prison Terms will hold a clemency hearing today
and make its recommendation to Davis.</LD>

<LD>Members of the Windsor Town Council sided with angry neighbors in
voicing their opposition to plans for a 50-home Indian reservation
just outside the city limits.</LD>
<LD>   The council didn't name the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians or its
proposed development on Windsor River Road. But council members
outlined a letter to the Board of Supervisors, opposing the building
of any more homes than allowed under the Sonoma County general plan,
which permits 10.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the council nor the supervisors has jurisdiction over the
tribe. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has yet to render a decision.</LD>

<HD>Giuliani Lends His Star to Friend Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: Former New York mayor praises the GOP hopeful's
integrity, leadership abilities and work ethic. He will appear in a
TV spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Simon Jr., the Republican gubernatorial candidate who has lived
in California for 11 years and never before has run for political
office, on Thursday trotted out his not-so-secret weapon: the
ex-mayor of a city 3,000 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Rudolph Giuliani, Simon's onetime boss in the U.S. attorney's
office in New York City, lent his star to the man he called a "close
friend." Giuliani headlined a news conference and fund-raiser before
shooting a commercial and preparing for another fund-raiser today.</LD>
<LD>   At every opportunity, Giuliani praised Simon's integrity,
leadership abilities and work ethic, even comparing him with
President Bush.</LD>
<TE>   "He's exactly the kind of person you want to step into politics at
a time when Americans need to be inspired by the leaders they have,"
Giuliani said at a packed news conference at a Century City hotel.
"California cannot get a better man than Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>   Before he was elected mayor of New York in 1993, Giuliani was the
U.S. attorney for the city. Simon worked under him as an assistant
U.S. attorney from 1985 through 1988, handling civil and criminal
cases. Giuliani said Simon was instrumental in helping convict
leaders of the city's five Mafia families.</TE>
<TE>   "He took on a lot of organized crime cases where it would not be
an exaggeration to say his life was in jeopardy," Giuliani said.
Among his duties was using civil procedures to seize convicted
mobsters' assets.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani endorsed Simon last summer, when Time magazine's new
person of the year was just the mayor of the largest city in the U.S.
Since Giuliani has become a national hero for his response to the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Simon campaign is hoping he can help
catapult the little-known Pacific Palisades investment banker from
the bottom of the polls into the lead of the Republican primary race.
Giuliani is expected to return in the coming weeks for a tour of the
state with Simon, campaign aides said.</TE>
<TE>   But Giuliani has backed three major candidates outside of New York
City since Sept. 11, and each has lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think his New York magic transfers automatically to
California," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, who
attended the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what advantage Giuliani gives to Simon, Jeffe pointed to
eight TV cameras in the rear of the room. "There it is," she said.
"When have you seen this at a Simon event, let alone a campaign
event? ... It's about getting Simon some exposure that he could never
get. Giuliani's a rock star."</TE>
<TE>   Simon campaign consultant Sal Russo said he was not expecting
miracles--nor did he need them. "We don't expect people to transfer
their admiration for Rudy Giuliani [to Simon], but we expect voters
to transfer their attention," he said. Giuliani's praise, Russo said,
will help introduce Simon to voters who don't know him.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has yet to advertise on TV, unlike former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, who leads Republicans in fund-raising, and Gov. Gray
Davis. The fact that Simon has yet to go on TV and has been reluctant
to attack his rivals makes some question whether he is simply
positioning himself to run for U.S. Senate or governor in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Simon dismissed such speculation. "We are running a serious
campaign and we are going to win the primary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Russo said Simon could not advertise on television until Giuliani
came to Los Angeles to record a commercial, which he did Thursday
afternoon at a local studio. Russo said the ad would appear "in a
matter of hours." Television political ad rates are lower on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, the multimillionaire son of former U.S. Treasury Secretary
William E. Simon, has trailed Riordan in raising campaign cash,
though he is ahead of the third Republican in the race, Secretary of
State Bill Jones. But Simon aides said they hoped to bring in as much
as $1 million during Giuliani's visit, with Thursday's $1,000-a-plate
luncheon for about 300 supporters and a pricier fund-raiser today.</TE>
<TE>   The luncheon began with Simon's 9-year-old son, Griffy, leading
the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance. Simon introduced Giuliani,
speaking about how he and other federal prosecutors idolized him
during their time working together in the 1980s. Then Giuliani
invoked Bush in making the case for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani said that on Sept. 11 he felt sympathy for Bush's
situation, facing the worst attack on U.S. citizens in the nation's
history after only nine months in office.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling Bush's presidential race against Al Gore, Giuliani said,
"The other guy had more experience ....But what George W. Bush had to
call upon was his depth of character ... which allowed him to handle
the worst crisis in the history of the United States. And that's what
you have in Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>   The Californian most identified with Giuliani is Simon's rival in
the Republican primary, Riordan. Like Giuliani, Riordan captured a
big-city mayor's office with no prior political experience, and he
shares the former New York mayor's liberal streak on social issues,
such as abortion and gun control. By contrast, Simon opposes abortion
rights and much gun control.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani endorsed Simon before Riordan entered the race, but he
downplayed ideological differences. Anyway, he added, "it wouldn't
matter who he was running against, I would be on Bill's side."</TE>

<HD>Southwest Ekes Out a Profit for Fourth Quarter</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Dallas-based company is the only one to show
gains in the period after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southwest Airlines, again squeezing the most from its lean
operations, said Thursday that it eked out a profit in the fourth
quarter when every other major U.S. airline was losing money in the
aftermath of Sept. 11. Northwest Airlines and US Airways reported
huge fourth-quarter losses Thursday, just as American Airlines parent
AMR Corp. and Continental Airlines did a day earlier.</LD>
<LD>   United Airlines parent UAL Corp. also is expected to show a big
quarterly loss when it announces its results Feb. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The big carriers, despite slashing their operations, have been
pummeled by the drop in passenger traffic because of the terrorist
attacks and the weak economy.</LD>
<TE>   Southwest, which unlike the other big carriers did not cut its
flights or staff, still earned $32.4million, or 4 cents a diluted
share, in the fourth quarter, excluding its portion of cash aid from
the federal bailout and other one-time gains and charges.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the exclusions, Wall Street expected the Dallas-based
carrier to break even, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Including the special items, Southwest earned $63.5 million, or 8
cents a share, compared with $154.7 million, or 19 cents, a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gratifying to be under such duress in our industry and turn
out a profit," said Gary Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer.
But he said demand for air travel remains weak and fare sales aimed
at stimulating traffic are "going to continue at least for the
foreseeable future."</TE>
<TE>   Southwest said it earned $511.1million, or 63 cents a share, for
all of 2001 (after including the government aid), which gave the
Dallas-based airline its 29th straight year of profitability. It's a
string unmatched by any other carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Kelly said Southwest plans to end one of its trademark
practices: handing out plastic boarding cards to passengers at the
gate. With new security measures creating longer lines at
airports--including 100% baggage matching that begins
today--Southwest plans to issue conventional paper boarding passes at
ticket counters so travelers don't have to stand in more lines than
necessary, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can minimize the number of steps that a customer has to go
through, that would be more efficient," he said. The change should
occur within six months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest's fourth-quarter loss, excluding the federal aid and
other special items, was $256 million, or $3.02 a share, better than
the $3.18-a-share loss expected by Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest Chairman Richard Anderson said "domestic traffic has
been progressively recovering," but earnings from those passengers is
still below year-ago levels because business travel is down.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways, considered one of the industry's weakest players, said
its fourth-quarter loss--excluding the government cash and one-time
items--was $552 million, or $8.16 a share, worse than the per-share
loss of $7.54 forecast by analysts.</TE>
<TE>   When the aid and other special gains and charges were included,
the Arlington, Va.-based carrier said it lost nearly $2 billion, or
$29.28 a share, for all of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Another victim of the travel slump is Sabre Holdings Corp., the
airline reservations giant. The company said its fourth-quarter
profit, excluding special items, plunged 88% to $4 million, or 3
cents a share, from $32 million, or 25 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest's stock rose 39 cents a share to close at $17.90 and US
Airways fell 41 cents to $5.20, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
Northwest shares fell 80 cents to close at $16.03 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Argentina's Central Bank Chief Resigns</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Roque Maccarone quits as peso continues to
fade and desperate citizens keep up protests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Argentina's central bank chief resigned Thursday as the peso
continued its fall and the country lurched closer to economic chaos.</LD>
<LD>   There were reports of continued widespread demonstrations by
citizens against a government freeze on bank deposits and raids by
police on bank branches for allegedly ignoring the freeze. Citibank,
meanwhile, wrote off $470 million in loan losses connected to its
Argentina operation.</LD>
<LD>   The peso closed at 2.10 to the dollar in Thursday trading, down
10% from the previous day, continuing its slide from the 1.40
official rate imposed last week. The drop came despite government
intervention in the markets to back the fading currency.</LD>
<TE>   Until the devaluation, the peso had traded on a 1-1 parity with
the dollar for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's leading stock index gained 8.2% Thursday, as trading
resumed after an eight-day halt.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said it was a symptom of Argentines' desperate quest
for some sort of safe investment haven from the rapidly devaluing
peso.</TE>
<TE>   Roque Maccarone quit the top central bank post for health reasons
and because of disputes with President Eduardo Duhalde over bank
policy. He has been replaced on an interim basis by Mario Blejer, a
former International Monetary Fund economist.</TE>
<TE>   Blejer's appointment, if made permanent by congressional approval,
could improve Argentina's chances of getting the international
assistance package it needs to start on the road to recovery, said
Carlos Janada, an economist with ABN Amro in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "He is well-known in Washington. If he accepts the permanent job,
the market will be pleased and that would help Argentina," Janada
said. The nation is in the grip of a four-year recession, 18%
unemployment and a de facto collapse of its banking system.</TE>
<TE>   The resignation reflects the increasing pressure Duhalde is under
for the banking policies he has inherited and toughened since taking
office Jan. 2 as the fifth president over a two-week period.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde's conversion of dollar-indexed bank loans to pesos to ease
the pain of devaluation while promising dollar depositors that they
will someday get their cash back in that currency has created a
nightmare for the banking industry.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde earlier this week announced further modifications to the
bank deposit freeze that has triggered sporadic protests and rioting
throughout the country. But the changes reinforced the impression of
many outside observers that Duhalde is improvising policy on a daily
basis.</TE>
<TE>   The international financial community is still waiting for Duhalde
to unveil a comprehensive monetary policy and a 2002 budget, the
prerequisites for some sort of IMF assistance package that could
total $15 billion or more.</TE>
<TE>   "For a guy who was arguing for the need of an emergency government
prior to assuming power, I am surprised at how little prepared
Duhalde is," said Miguel Diaz of the Center of Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Under any scenario, Argentina faces tough times. Although a return
to the hyper-inflation of the 1980s is a long shot, Janada expects up
to 50% inflation this year.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde faces intense pressure on one side from bankers and
economists, who want him to convert dollar deposits to pesos as he
did loans, and on the other side by angry citizens whose rage will
explode if their bank accounts lose exemption from the devaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz of CSIS said Duhalde, despite his difficulties, is
Argentina's best and maybe last chance at a political solution,
before anarchy or military intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "That last scenario is the least likely, but it's now in the realm
of the possible," Diaz said.</TE>

<HD>Court Bars AT&amp;T Plan on Dispute Resolution</HD>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal court in California has struck down AT&amp;T Corp.'s
5-month-old requirement that consumers refer all disputes to
arbitration, saying the company was illegally trying to limit its
liability by restricting a consumer's right to sue.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Magistrate Judge Bernard Zimmerman said AT&amp;T was
"disingenuous" in arguing that its mandatory-arbitration provision
was designed to give consumers a broad range of options to resolve
disputes. "I find AT&amp;T's principal purpose was to put sufficient
obstacles in the path of litigants to effectively deter many claims
from being pursued," Zimmerman said in a ruling made public
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling was issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California and applies to 7 million AT&amp;T customers in
California. Arbitration experts said Wednesday that the decision
could have broad implications for consumers and companies across the
country, as mandatory-arbitration provisions have been adopted in
recent years by a growing number of firms, including banks,
retailers, computer makers and health maintenance organizations.</LD>
<TE>   Arbitration experts said Zimmerman's ruling was significant,
partly because it upholds arbitration in general.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, "it provides additional guidance to businesses
that want to include arbitration provisions in their contracts with
consumers," said Washington lawyer Eric Mogilnicki.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T said Wednesday that it planned to appeal Zimmerman's ruling.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup Reports 36% Profit Jump</HD>
<DH>Banking: Increased consumer borrowing in fourth quarter
offsets write-offs for Enron, Argentina losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE STEIN</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services firm, said
fourth-quarter profit rose 36% as lending to consumers surged. The
company wrote off $698 million for Enron Corp.'s collapse and
Argentina's default.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $3.88 billion, or 74 cents a share, from $2.84
billion, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 12% to $22
billion.</LD>
<LD>   The lowest interest rates in 40years spurred a 20% rise in revenue
in the global consumer unit and sliced the bank's cost of funds.
Profit in the division, run by Robert Willumstad, rose 20% to $2
billion. Citigroup expenses fell as it shed 12,000 jobs in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "The consumer business saved the day," said Jay Willadsen, who
helps manage $22 billion at Independence Investment in Boston,
including Citigroup shares.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Sanford Weill said profit from Citigroup's
consumer group probably will rise by a "mid-double-digit" percentage
in 2002. On Tuesday, he named Willumstad Citigroup's president.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings at investment bank Salomon Smith Barney rose 17% to $701
million. Rivals Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. all reported lower profit for the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares rose $1.20 to close at $49.90 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-quarter net income was more than double the $1.69 billion
that J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., its closest banking rival, reported
Wednesday for all of 2001. Citigroup earned $14.1 billion in the
year, 4% more than in 2000. Revenue for 2001 was $83.6 billion, up 8%
from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Enron  cost Citigroup $228 million before taxes in the period as
it wrote off loans and trading positions. Economic difficulties in
Argentina cost the bank an additional $470 million.</TE>

<HD>Studios Spur Measures to Thwart Piracy</HD>
<DH>Digital: Joining forces with high-tech and
consumer-electronics firms, they push for technology to block video
swapping.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eager to block video piracy, the Hollywood studios and TV networks
are trying to alter the design of digital TVs, recorders and
computers to stop programs broadcast over the air from being swapped
over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The effort is the latest fallout from Napster and other online
file-sharing sites, which have spurred millions of consumers to copy
an incalculable amount of music and video for free through the Net.
Online piracy experts say more than 1 million movie files are copied
online daily.</LD>
<LD>   Working with consumer-electronics and high-tech companies, the
studios hope to reach consensus on a technology for protecting
digital TV broadcasts by the end of March, with products
incorporating it as early as next year.</LD>
<TE>   The inter-industry Broadcast Protection Discussion Group is
considering a proposal by News Corp. that would use electronic tags
within a digital TV broadcast to dictate whether a program could be
copied through the Net. Supporters of the proposal want the federal
government to mandate that all digital TV sets, receivers and
computers be capable of reading and obeying those tags.</TE>
<TE>   Although the studios and TV networks are supported to some degree
by consumer-electronics and technology companies, critics warn that
the effort ultimately could hurt consumers who've already bought
sets, as well as stifling innovation.</TE>
<TE>   "If we go down that road, we're going to live in a world where
people with the next great technological innovation are going to have
to go ask permission in Hollywood before their product is allowed to
ship," said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney for the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group for civil liberties
on the Net. "That's not the way the United States has become a leader
in the technological world."</TE>
<TE>   But advocates say free TV could evaporate if broadcasters can't
assure the studios that their movies won't be retransmitted freely
over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "If something is not done to provide some degree of security, then
it drives content to [cable and satellite TV] systems. And I don't
see how that is in the overall public interest," said Fritz Attaway,
an executive vice president for the Motion Picture Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Added Andrew G. Setos, president of engineering for the Fox Group,
"We want to head off the Napsterization of digital television.At a
meeting Tuesday of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group,
Setos--one of three co-chairmen--laid out a proposal for blocking
Internet redistribution.</TE>
<TE>   Setos' plan is simple on the surface. Broadcasters would insert an
electronic tag into digital programs to indicate whether the program
could be retransmitted over the Internet. That tag would be read by
each device that can receive a digital TV stream, and if the flag
said no retransmission, the program could not be passed digitally
over the Net.</TE>
<TE>   The Advanced Television Systems Committee, the group that sets
standards for how digital TV is broadcast, is already developing a
standard for inserting the tags into a TV signal. It's up to the
Broadcast Protection Discussion Group, however, to define how sets
and other devices would react to the tags.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus among consumer-electronics and technology companies
is to block Internet redistribution, but making the system work and
resist hacking won't be easy, said Jim Burger, an attorney
representing the computer industry. There's also the question of how
much the added technology will cost, and who will pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Klein, a vice president at the Consumer Electronics Assn.,
said his group agrees that there needs to be some controls on
Internet distribution of TV broadcasts. "However," he added, "the
protection that would accomplish that should not in any way inhibit
transmitting the content within the home network."</TE>
<TE>   Setos' proposal wouldn't rule out home networks, but it would
require them to use a secure protocol instead of the common Ethernet
standard.</TE>
<TE>   To be effective, the control technology would have to be found in
every device capable of receiving a DTV signal. That means the
federal government will have to mandate the technology in new
devices, either through regulation or law.</TE>
<TE>   A major problem for the industry, however, is that the
restrictions can be enforced only on devices that receive the TV
signal digitally. And the majority of the 2 million HDTV sets on the
market don't have digital connectors. They talk to each other through
analog outputs and inputs, and those sockets can't obey the rules
that the studios want to impose.</TE>
<TE>   The Broadcast Protection Discussion Group isn't addressing what
happens over analog connectors. And there's a wide split among
consumer-electronics companies and studios over how to plug that gap.</TE>
<TE>   What some studios want to do is require all protected
programs--that is, all shows marked for no redistribution over the
Internet--to be transmitted only through digital outputs. HDTV
monitors with analog outputs would be cut off or limited to receiving
something less than high-definition TV.</TE>
<TE>   An alternative, Setos said, is developing a watermark that could
be passed through analog connectors yet still tell digital devices
not to retransmit shows over the Net. To make this approach work, any
device that could convert analog video to digital would have to look
for the watermark and respect the restrictions it imposed.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer-electronics executives say they don't want consumers
who've invested in HDTVs--about 2 million so far--to lose any of the
value of their investment. But Preston Padden, an executive vice
president of Walt Disney Co., said the impact would be extremely
limited. "If the biggest problem to getting this solved is the 13
people who've already purchased HDTVs, I will personally drive the
converter boxes to their homes and install them myself."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Workers Auction Off Enron Stuff</HD>

<LD>Enron Corp. employees who lost their jobs, their pensions, their
401(k) plans and all hope that their company stock would ever be
worth anything have turned to a new source to make cash out of their
years with the company--EBay Inc.'s Web site.</LD>
<LD>   "I had all this stuff sitting around that the company had given
out--paperweights, Christmas ornaments, Swiss Army knives, golf
shirts--all with the Enron logo on it," said Kim Zachary, who had
worked in marketing for Enron for nine years and was only three
months away from qualifying for her pension when the company went
bust. "I thought maybe I could make something off of them. I had
bills to pay."</LD>
<LD>   As of Thursday, the 44-year-old Houston resident had made
$2,000--about twice her monthly unemployment check--by selling more
than 40 items on the Web's most popular auction site. It helps soothe
the pain of the nearly $12,000 stock loss she suffered as Enron's
market value plummeted.</LD>
<TE>   The sudden implosion of Enron has sparked a nationwide hunt for
even the most trivial trinket connected with the bankrupt
energy-trading firm. More than 600 Enron items have made it onto EBay
since the scandal erupted.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most popular are copies of the Enron "Code of Ethics."
The bidding had reached $225 late Thursday. One copy was advertised
as "never read."</TE>
<TE>   "I can see where the Code of Ethics would be pretty funny," said
Terry Kovel, a collecting expert who along with her husband, Ralph,
writes "Kovel's Antiques and Collectibles Price List," which now is
in its 34th edition.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Enron items on the block and their recent bids:</TE>
<TE>   * A ceramic "retirement planning" coffee mug for $102.50.</TE>
<TE>   * A mouse pad with the inscription "Smooth Sailing" for $31.</TE>
<TE>   * Stock certificates currently worth 38 cents in over-the-counter
trading for $300.</TE>
<TE>   * A set of three Titleist golf balls with the company's tri-color
logo for $66.</TE>
<TE>   * A copy of Enron's "The Basics of Risk Management" for $152.50.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, we have seen people begin listing and then buying
merchandise on EBay whenever a business or an event or a person
becomes the center of media attention," said EBay spokesman Kevin
Pursglove. "We're an immediate and direct reflection of popular
culture and what's happening in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Kovel has found that there are people who will collect anything
tinged by scandal, and the Enron collapse certainly fits the pattern.
But she doubts the Enron items will turn out to be more than a flash
in the pan.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't personally see there's going to be any long-lasting
monetary gain from any of this," Kovel said. "If you want to send a
joke to a stockbroker friend of yours, that'd be kind of fun. But
once this is off the front pages, these things will be as good as
dead and buried."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Markle hopes to cash in before that happens. The
33-year-old father of four lost an estimated $250,000 in sales
bonuses, stock options and retirement savings when his sales job at
Enron disappeared. He got the idea of auctioning off corporate
trinkets from a former colleague.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he sold a bunch of items and made about $800 off of
them," Markle said. "He said he was shocked that people were
interested, but it was a great way to put groceries on the table."</TE>

<HD>Ford Closes Books on a Dismal 2001</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Auto maker's second-worst quarter ever leads to
$5.45 billion in losses for what began as a promising year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Capping a disastrous year, Ford Motor Co. on Thursday reported its
second-deepest quarterly loss ever, saying it lost $5.05 billion in
the fourth quarter after a massive restructuring charge.</LD>
<LD>   Ford's net losses amounted to a staggering $5.45 billion after
charges, or $3.02 a share, for 2001, a year marked by embarrassing
quality and customer service setbacks, billions spent on the
Firestone tire recall and fierce discounting, and the ouster of the
auto maker's chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement of the loss came less than a week after the
world's second-largest auto maker revealed a turnaround plan that
includes shedding 35,000 jobs, closing five factories in North
America and slashing costs to raise profit by $9 billion by
mid-decade.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a challenging, difficult year for the Ford Motor Co. and
our financial performance was unacceptable," Chairman William Clay
Ford Jr. said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "As outlined in our revitalization plan, we are committed to
regaining our momentum and getting back on track," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's fourth-quarter loss was $860 million on an operating basis.
For the full year, Ford's operating loss was $782 million, or 44
cents a share, a spectacular drop from operating profit in 2000 of
$6.67 billion that raised visions of passing General Motors Corp. as
the world's largest auto manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the expected disaster. Ford is hemorrhaging red ink all
over the place," said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. "I
think the fact that they are heading for flat market share for the
Ford brand over the next few years indicates that they've given up
hopes of overtaking GM."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday GM reported a net profit in 2001 of $601 million on
sales of $177 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's revenue in 2001 was $162.4 billion, down 5% from $170.1
billion a year ago, while vehicle unit sales were 6.99 million, a 6%
decline from 7.42 million. U.S. market share fell to 22.8% from 23.7%
the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   "The erosion of industry pricing, Ford's U.S. market share losses
and obvious cost problems depressed Ford's results in late 2001,"
said Merrill Lynch auto analyst John Casesa.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these same forces will be at work in 2002," Casesa said.
"Ford is beginning to confront the hailstorm of problems that always
seem to occur simultaneously once an auto company's business model
cracks."</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares declined 25 cents to close at $14.70 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   It was the worst quarterly loss for Ford since the first quarter
of 1992, when the auto maker lost $6.7billion because of accounting
adjustments for retirement benefits. Overall, Ford lost $7.6 billion
that year.</TE>
<TE>   Ford was forced to match GM's zero-interest financing for the last
four months of 2001, a costly scheme to lure customers back to
showrooms after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, marketing costs skyrocketed to 16.7% of revenue in
the fourth quarter, compared with 11.1% in all of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's fourth quarter included a $4.1-billion charge for the
restructuring plan, under which hourly workers will get no
profit-sharing checks this year, and William Ford will draw no salary
or bonus for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   The company said last week that it will break even in 2002 before
improving profit.</TE>
<TE>   Ford will try to raise about $1billion by selling non-core assets
this year, and is preparing to sell $3billion of convertible
securities next week, Chief Financial Officer Martin Inglis said
Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Fox Eyes Saturday Morning Windfall</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox television network stands to make $25 million or more a year by
auctioning off its Saturday morning time periods to outside
production companies.</LD>
<LD>   Industry observers worry that this is a dangerous precedent that
could lead to a deterioration in program quality, especially if
cash-strapped networks lease other poorly performing time periods to
the highest bidder.</LD>
<LD>   Some worry that News Corp.-owned Fox's financial success could
prompt other networks to become landlords, with the next auction
candidate being Saturday night, when prime-time viewership is at its
lowest.</LD>
<TE>   Animation companies DIC Entertainment and 4 Kids Entertainment are
locked in a bidding war for Fox's four-hour Saturday morning time
period, according to several sources close to the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The winner could be announced next week, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox bids are three times higher than the $8 million a year
that Discovery Communications Corp. agreed to pay NBC last month for
its three-hour Saturday morning block.</TE>
<TE>   With such a high fee, television executives say DIC or 4 Kids will
have difficulty making money. The two firms have been willing to
outbid Nickelodeon, Warner Bros. and other well-heeled rivals because
of the opportunity to sell truckloads of toys to young viewers. They
otherwise risk being locked out of a contracting business dominated
by giants such as Walt Disney Co., Viacom Inc. and AOL Time Warner
Inc. that own cable channels and animation factories.</TE>
<TE>   None of the companies involved in the bidding would comment.</TE>
<TE>   For the networks, Saturday morning has been the most distressed
time period in their portfolios. Since the mid-'90s, cable channels
led by Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network have lured viewers away from
all networks except for the kid-centric WB. This has left most of the
major networks with mounting losses as they struggled to fulfill
federal educational requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission requires broadcast stations
to air three hours a week of educational programming for children,
despite protests from the industry that kids aren't interested in
these shows.</TE>
<TE>   NBC sources say it could have gotten more money for its Saturday
morning sale but bidders were required to fulfill the three-hour
educational requirement. Fox requires that only one hour of its
Saturday morning block be educational, allowing the other three to be
commercial programming.</TE>
<TE>   "This jacks up the obligation on the FCC to enforce the rules,"
said Reed Hundt, a former FCC chairman who is now at McKinsey &amp; Co.
Hundt said the FCC has implied that it will not enforce the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Both DIC and 4 Kids are known for toy-driven programs. Though 4
Kids is best known for Pokemon, the hit on the WB network, the
publicly traded company also represents Nintendo and Hot Rod Monster
Jam. DIC has produced such hits as "Inspector Gadget" and "Super
Mario Bros."</TE>
<TE>   DIC and 4 Kids appear to have knocked out of the running Viacom's
Nickelodeon, the leader of the children's television business.
Nickelodeon now provides programs for Viacom's CBS on Saturday
mornings and was looking to expand its broadcast reach.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Nickelodeon said the network could not justify
paying more than $15 million for Fox's block.</TE>
<TE>   Like all the networks, Fox is suffering from declining profit as
programming costs rise and viewers grow more loyal to cable. The
problems have been masked in part by a steady growth in advertising
that ended last year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of the brave new world we are in," said Rick Rosen,
a partner at the Endeavor talent agency. "The advertising world is
upside down."</TE>
<TE>   In response, networks have cut costs, produced cheaper programming
and are searching for new revenue streams.</TE>
<TE>   To staunch Saturday morning losses, CBS turned nearly two years
ago to Nickelodeon, while ABC has relied on parent Disney for several
years.</TE>
<TE>   The trend has left fewer and fewer time periods for independents
such as DIC and 4 Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Fox was one of the last Saturday morning holdouts. But after the
sale to Disney in November of its children's programming arm, Fox
moved to exit the business by auctioning off the Saturday time slots.</TE>

<HD>GE's Earnings Rise 9.7%, Matching Estimates</HD>

<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose 9.7% as it cut
costs and sales fell for a third quarter in a row, with the U.S.
recession hurting businesses such as plastics and broadcasting.</LD>
<LD>   Net income increased to $3.93 billion, or 39 cents a share, from
$3.59 billion, or 36 cents, a year earlier, matching analyst
estimates. Sales dropped 2.9% to $33.98 billion because the largest
company by market value sold some operations, mainly in its GE
Capital finance unit.</LD>
<LD>   Profit rose as Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt increased margins
last year to 19.6% of sales by eliminating jobs, exiting lower-margin
markets and reducing administrative costs. Immelt has said he's now
considering buying companies with $100 billion in revenue to add more
profitable sales growth and augment units such as medical and power
systems.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of General Electric, maker of aircraft engines and light
bulbs, and parent of the NBC network, rose $1.08 to $38.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarter, a $642-million gain from the sale of a majority
stake in a satellite business helped offset $656 million in expenses
related to the cost cutting. GE Capital also had an $84-million loss
on investments in bonds of Enron Corp. after the energy trader sought
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Immelt reiterated that profit this year will rise at least 17% as
gains at the finance, power and medical businesses more than offset
declines at NBC, plastics and electrical-equipment units. A change in
how acquisitions are accounted for will increase profit by about 4%,
he has said.</TE>

<DL>ARMONK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>IBM Corp., the largest seller of computers and related services,
reported a 13% decline in fourth-quarter profit on lower revenue from
personal computers and custom chips.</LD>
<LD>   IBM shares fell on the news to $114.65 in after-hours trading
after closing at $119.90, up $2.65, on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Net income in the fourth quarter fell to $2.33 billion, or $1.33 a
share, from $2.67 billion, or $1.48, a year earlier, IBM said. The
results were a penny better than the $1.32 a share analysts had
forecast, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue fell 11% to $22.8billion, compared with $25.6 billion a
year earlier. That fell short of analysts' average estimate of $23.8
billion.</TE>
<TE>   IBM's multiyear contracts to run clients' computer networks, plus
sales of high-margin database and Web management software, have made
the company a haven for investors as technology spending slowed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a tough year, but our fourth-quarter results were
strong relative to our competitors," Chief Financial Officer John
Joyce said during a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   The company said profit edged out forecasts because of strong
sales of products with high profit margins, including mainframe
computers, high-performance Unix servers and software.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in mainframe computer sales was the first since 1989. Its
Regatta servers, which run on the Linux operating system, sold out
completely, IBM said.</TE>

<HD>Rescue Expert Selected by Kmart</HD>
<DH>Retailing: New Chairman James B. Adamson has helped other
chains through bankruptcy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. has tapped retailing turnaround expert James B. Adamson
to help rescue the nation's second-largest discount chain,
heightening speculation that the ailing company may be headed to
Bankruptcy Court.</LD>
<LD>   Adamson, a Kmart director who steered the Advantica restaurant
company and Revco drugstore chain through bankruptcy reorganizations,
becomes the retailer's chairman. Charles C. Conaway, who was hired in
May 2000, remains chief executive, the company said Thursday. But his
top lieutenant, Mark S. Schwartz, departed as president and chief
operating officer.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart also said it is reviewing business plans for this year and
next and it is in talks with lenders for new financing. The company
would not elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   Kmart's shares, which have been pummeled this year, were off 4
cents to $1.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock led the
most-active list for the second consecutive session.</TE>
<TE>   Adamson's selection as chairman means Kmart is "considering
bankruptcy very seriously," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's
Weekly Retail Marketing Report.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokesman Jack Ferry would not speculate on Kmart's
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly his broad experience in a number of business areas will
serve us well as we review various alternatives to address Kmart's
needs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Adamson's elevation could reassure some Kmart
suppliers, who were doing business with Revco when the drug store
chain was revived after being "literally on death's doorstep," said
Burt Flickinger, a consultant who has been meeting this week with
companies that manufacture hard goods for Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart had to take some sort of action to stop what has been a
"freight train of negative news," said Eric Beder, an analyst with
Ladenburg Thalmann &amp; Co. This week, for example, Standard &amp; Poor's
and Moody's Investors Service cut their Kmart ratings twice--to low
junk-bond levels--and Fitch cut its ratings once.</TE>
<TE>   To restore confidence, the company should clarify its business
plan for the 2002 fiscal year and discuss financing prospects, said
Angela Jameson, managing director of retail and consumer goods for
Moody's.</TE>
<TE>   "There's very little clarity on this point," she said. "And that's
key to determining Kmart's credit quality going forward."</TE>
<TE>   Moody's latest move to lower Kmart's ratings--after the board
emerged from two days of meetings but made no announcement about its
plans--shows that Moody's already believes the risk of default "has
increased very significantly," Jameson added.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Beder predicted that Kmart will line up another round of
financing rather than filing for bankruptcy protection. He said Kmart
should be able to arrange about $3 billion in financing, since
secured loans can be obtained for 60% of the value of a company's
inventory, about $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company could shore up investors' confidence by
shuttering 200 to 300 poorly performing stores. "I think the street
would look upon that as a huge positive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart has been struggling to hold its own against brutal
competition--industry behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which often
boasts lower prices, and trendier discounter Target Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Adamson, 53, was chairman of Advantica Restaurant Group Inc.,
operator of the Denny's chain that emerged from bankruptcy protection
in 1998, until he retired last month. He has been on Kmart's board
since 1996.</TE>

<HD>Upbeat Results Boost Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Market retakes some lost territory after
Wednesday's steep sell-off as investors look for bargains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bargain hunting propelled stocks higher Thursday after
better-than-expected results from Internet bellwether Yahoo and blue
chips Citigroup, GE and Sears Roebuck renewed hopes that business
conditions are improving.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said investors were lured by lower stock prices,
particularly in the tech sector, after Wednesday's steep sell-off.
Investors also were betting that Microsoft and IBM would issue
bullish forecasts, but were disappointed when both companies
indicated after regular trading ended that conditions are still
difficult.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, bond yields jumped on unexpectedly strong economic
reports, and oil prices sank to a two-month low.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 137.77 points, or 1.4%,
at 9,850.04, rebounding from Wednesday's 211-point loss. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index rose 11.31 points, or 1.0%, to 1,138.88. The
Nasdaq composite index gained 41.38 points, or 2.1%, to 1,985.82.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led advancers 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-quarter earnings reports this month have offered a mixed
assessment--tempting many investors to preserve their gains from the
recent rally, rather than risk losing them should an economic
recovery be delayed. Wall Street also has gotten into the habit of
driving up a stock price on hopes of strong earnings, and then
selling on the news to lock in profits.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo jumped $2.25, or 13%, to $20.12 on better-than-expected
earnings and signs that its ad market appears to have stabilized.</TE>
<TE>   But after the market closed, investors got a reminder of how murky
the technology picture is. A cautious outlook from Microsoft sent its
stock down $2.71 to $67.15 in after-hours trading, despite a $1.99
gain during the day and earnings that, excluding a one-time charge,
exceeded estimates.</TE>
<TE>   IBM posted results that beat expectations, but the company
indicated that business, while strengthening, is still tentative. The
stock fell $5.25 to $114.65 in the after-hours session, reversing a
gain of $2.65 during the day.</TE>
<TE>   In regular trading, Dow component GE rose $1.08 to $38.75, after
the company said net income rose 9% and affirmed 2002 financial
targets. Retailer Sears Roebuck reported a 12% increase in net
income, despite lower sales, and its shares gained $1.23 to $52.70.</TE>
<TE>   Dow component Citigroup added $1.40 to $49.90. The No.1 U.S.
financial services company said its fourth-quarter profit rose as low
interest rates drove up revenue at its consumer banking businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil prices tumbled 89 cents to $17.97 a barrel in New York
trading on news of surplus U.S. stockpiles and weakening demand. It
was the lowest close since Nov. 19 and was nearing the 52-week low of
$17.45 set Nov. 14.</TE>
<TE>   * Mildly upbeat economic news lifted bond yields. The Labor
Department reported the number of workers applying for state
unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in nearly
six months. That damped hopes for further Federal Reserve rate cuts,
and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond climbed to 4.93%
from 4.84% Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   * Dow component J.P. Morgan Chase rose 65 cents to $36.85, after
falling sharply the previous session on dismal earnings. Standard &amp;
Poor's rating agency also cut the bank's outlook to "negative" from
"stable," citing loan and investment banking problems.</TE>
<TE>   * Aerospace equipment maker and Dow component United Technologies
soared $4.30, or 7.3%, to $63.35 after beating Wall Street estimates
despite a 19% drop in fourth-quarter earnings.</TE>
<TE>   * Kmart fell 4 cents to $1.56 on news its president has left. The
troubled retailer's stock has been tumbling on fears it is headed
toward a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   * Ford Motor lost 25 cents to $14.70 after the car maker reported
a net loss of $5 billion for the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Apple Computer rose $1.70 to $22.48, after it posted a profit in
line with expectations and a turnaround from its year-earlier loss.</TE>

<HD>Court Rulings Go Against Disney in Pooh Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge has made several rulings
against Walt Disney Co. in a bitter lawsuit with a small Florida firm
over hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties from the sale of
Winnie the Pooh merchandise, according to new court documents.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Ernest M. Hiroshige in August sanctioned
Disney $90,000 for destroying 40 boxes of documents, including one
labeled "Winnie the Pooh--legal problems," according to court records
that will be unsealed today.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was filed 11 years ago by Stephen Slesinger Inc., which
holds merchandising rights to the Winnie the Pooh characters. The
Slesinger family maintains that Disney has cheated them out of at
least $200 million in royalties on Pooh-related videocassettes, DVDs,
computer software and merchandise sold in Disney theme parks.</LD>
<TE>   Hiroshige wrote that Disney "knew or should have known" that
Slesinger's lawyers would be interested in the destroyed documents,
and that Disney "made false and evasive responses" to requests by the
lawyers for the evidence, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to begin later this year and could reveal
the value of the lucrative Pooh franchise, which some analysts say in
some years has generated more than $4 billion for Disney and its
licensees.</TE>
<TE>   Disney maintains that it has fulfilled its royalty obligations
under a 1983 contract, and that the destroyed documents had little to
do with the Pooh legal case.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no proof that the documents destroyed were evidence,"
said Disney's lead attorney Daniel Petrocelli. "These were old
meaningless papers destroyed by people in Disney's records management
department who had no knowledge of any lawsuit. No harm, no foul."</TE>
<TE>   The shredded documents belonged to a former Disney executive,
Vincent Jefferds, who was in charge of Disney's consumer products
division two decades ago and signed the 1983 contract with
Slesinger's heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferds died in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Slesinger was a New York literary agent who acquired the Pooh
merchandising rights from author A.A. Milne in 1930. Slesinger's
widow and daughter sued Disney for fraud and breach of contract.</TE>
<TE>   Hiroshige also ruled in August that Disney cannot dispute
statements made by Jefferds during a 1983 meeting with Slesinger's
daughter at the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel. At the time,
the family was still negotiating with Disney over the royalty
contract that was signed a month later.</TE>
<TE>   Slesinger's widow and daughter contend that Jefferds assured them
that Disney would pay royalties on all Pooh merchandise, including
videocassettes, according to the court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has never paid royalties on Pooh videocassettes, DVDs or
computer software and the 1983 contract does not specifically mention
payments for videos, according to court records and attorneys in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Slesinger's daughter Patricia wrote a memo to her mother in March
1983 describing her conversation with Jefferds.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jefferds] said videos and all these new things are covered and
to shut up about it," according to court records that quote the
Patricia Slesinger memo.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's attorney Petrocelli said he plans to challenge the
authenticity of Slesinger's 1983 "Dear Mommy" memo.</TE>
<TE>   "What else can they say?" asked Slesinger attorney Bert Fields.
"The document buries them."</TE>
<TE>   A key question, however, that Hiroshige left open is whether
Jefferds had the authority to make promises binding Disney.</TE>
<TE>   The Slesinger heirs also contend that Disney failed to pay them
royalties on Pooh revenue generated at Disney theme parks in Japan
and France. In addition, they say Disney concealed promotional
payments it received, including a $600,000 payment by Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co. in 1975 so the retailer could sponsor a "Winnie the Pooh"
program on NBC television.</TE>
<TE>   Petrocelli's firm took over Disney's defense more than a year ago
after other lawyers were forced to recuse themselves since they
probably will be called to testify about the destroyed Pooh
documents.</TE>
<TE>   "For years and years, Slesinger has tried to show that they were
not getting paid," said Petrocelli. "But only after Vincent Jefferds
passes away do they suddenly say that this man made all these wild
promises that Disney would pay them for everything under the sun."</TE>
<TE>   Most details of the Pooh case have been secret since a November
1991 order sealed the court file. However, Hiroshige last month
granted a motion by The Times to unseal the files. Nearly 40 volumes
will be made available today.</TE>

<HD>Media and Tech Merger Oversight Plan Halted</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Lawmakers demand a say in changes to division of
authority between Justice Department and FTC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal antitrust authorities abruptly canceled plans Thursday to
announce changes in the way they review media and technology company
mergers after some members of Congress and the Federal Trade
Commission voiced concern over the reorganization.</LD>
<LD>   Industry and government officials close to the FTC had said
earlier that the Justice Department planned to assume sole
responsibility for reviewing mergers of companies in the software,
telecommunications and entertainment businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC, meanwhile, would have been given authority for health
care, oil, natural gas, electric power and computer hardware makers.
The reorganization was aimed at streamlining the duties of policing
competition in private industry.</LD>
<TE>   But the agencies appeared headed back to the negotiating table
after an FTC commissioner and some Capitol Hill lawmakers criticized
FTC Chairman Timothy J. Muris and Justice Department antitrust
division chief Charles A. James for crafting a reorganization plan
without their input.</TE>
<TE>   They said they wanted to get a detailed explanation about a plan
that could cause a sea change in antitrust oversight of the powerful
media and technology industries.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you make wholesale changes, I think this is a matter worth
some discussion," FTC Commissioner Mozelle W. Thompson said in an
interview. He added that "I'm not sure this agreement was the
answer."</TE>
<TE>   Mozelle contended that the FTC already has substantial experience
examining many media mergers, including the one that created AOL Time
Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Capitol Hill aides confirmed that Senate Appropriations Committee
staff members planned to meet with Justice and FTC officials over the
next few days to discuss the reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   But some political observers close to the FTC said the
reorganization plan may already be dead.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all a little surprised that the administration was moving
forward with little or no input from Congress," said Ken Johnson, a
spokesman for Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House
Commerce Committee, which oversees the FTC. "It was probably going to
go over like a lead balloon.... Obviously if they try to move forward
again, we will want to get our two cents in."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed reorganization would have changed an informal but
contentious half-century-old arrangement under which the FTC and the
Justice Department decided case by case which agency would review a
merger. The decision often was based on which agency had the most
industry expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the two agencies fought over an investigation of
computer chip giant Intel Corp. Later they vied over the deal that
created AOL Time Warner--a battle won by the FTC.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 still triggering
consolidation in the telephone and cable industries, some former
government officials said a clearer division of labor between the two
agencies might be warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "As a general matter, it's a good thing to reduce uncertainty and
avoid duplications so the agencies can focus on enforcing the laws,"
said Jeffrey H. Blattner, a former top deputy in the Justice
Department's antitrust division in the Clinton administration.</TE>

<LD>The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment
benefits fell by 14,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted total of

expected.</LD>

are adjusted for seasonal factors and claims unaffected by those
adjustments actually rose.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Carnival Corp. raised its hostile offer for P&amp;O Princess Cruises  by
12% to $6.4 billion. P&amp;O Princess said it would consider the new bid.</LD>
<LD>   The new bid of 71 cents a share is made up of 36 cents in cash and
0.138 Carnival shares. The offer is higher than its original bid of
65 cents a share made in December. Carnival also would assume about
$1.4 billion of debt.</LD>
<LD>   P&amp;O Princess may now be forced to talk with Miami-based Carnival,
investors said. London-based P&amp;O Princess has so far rejected
Carnival, saying a combination would be subject to more antitrust
scrutiny than a deal it has to buy Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for
$7.4 billion.</LD>
<TE>   On the NYSE, Carnival rose 40 cents to $26.46, Royal Caribbean
fell 56 cents to $16.19, and P&amp;O Princess Cruises rose 25 cents to
$24.16.</TE>

<LD>U.S. Steel Corp. got the option to buy a majority stake in National
Steel Corp. from a Japanese company as part of its plan to create one
of the largest steel companies in the world.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Steel, the biggest U.S. steelmaker, can buy as much as 53% of
Mishawaka, Ind.-based National Steel from Tokyo-based NKK Corp. under
the agreement that expires June 15. In return, NKK would have the
right to buy 4 million shares, or 4.5%, of U.S. Steel.</LD>
<LD>   If U.S. Steel exercises the option to buy NKK's shares, it also
would offer to exchange each remaining National Steel share for 0.086
of a U.S. Steel share. That values a National Steel share at $1.52,
based on the $17.70 closing price for U.S. Steel on Wednesday.</LD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EBay Inc. is raising many of the fees it charges to sell items on its
Web site.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Jan. 31, the online auction operator will take a
commission of 5.25%, instead of 5%, on items that sell for less than
$25. The rate is rising to 2.75%, from 2.5%, on items between $25 and
$1,000, and to 1.5%, from 1.25%, on sales of more than $1,000.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose-based company also said it will begin charging 5
cents for all products listed with the "buy it now" feature rather
than in the typical auction format.</LD>
<TE>   EBay said the higher fees would help the company invest in better

<DL></DL>
<LD>European plane maker Airbus said it will cut up to 1,000 jobs, or
2.2% of its work force, amid a slump in airliner demand.</LD>
<LD>   The Boeing Co. rival said the reductions will be made by
voluntary-retirement packages and attrition rather than direct
layoffs.</LD>
<LD>   With the termination of part-time and temporary work contracts and
the transfer of jobs to subcontractors, the company said it hoped to
save a total of $309 million in employment costs. Airbus said it
could maintain deliveries of aircraft at 300 planes in 2003--the year
deliveries are expected to hit a low.</LD>

<LD>Construction of new homes and apartments fell slightly in December

achievement considering that housing is usually one of the industries
hardest hit during a recession.</LD>
<LD>   Construction of new homes and apartments fell 3.4% to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.57 million units in December, led by a
22.6% plunge in apartment construction, the Commerce Department said.
The decline was led by a 22.6% plunge in apartment construction;
single-family home construction managed to increase 3.6%.</LD>
<LD>   For all of 2001, housing construction rose 2.1% to 1.6 million
units, the third-best performance in the last 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   The West was the only region of the country showing an increase in
housing starts for December, with a rise of 8.3%.</TE>

<LD>Lloyd's of London said it plans an overhaul that could spell the end
of the three-centuries-old insurance market's tradition of attracting
the wealthy to invest money and assume total liability for claims.</LD>
<LD>   Lloyd's backed proposals that force all investors in Lloyd's to
have limited liability, meaning the individual investors, known as
"names," will need to become companies by 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The plan now has to be approved by members later this year.</LD>
<TE>   Lloyd's, which was founded in the 1680s and almost collapsed in
the early 1990s, aims to increase scrutiny of the business and also
plans to reform its bookkeeping as the unprofitable market tries to
get more corporate members.</TE>
<TE>   Companies, which now put up 80% of Lloyd's capital, favor the
package.</TE>

<HD>Screener Rule Challenged</HD>
<DH>Courts: Requirement that airport security screeners be U.S.
citizens is unconstitutional, ACLU suit contends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Civil Liberties Union and a major labor union sued the
Department of Transportation on Thursday seeking to block a
post-Sept. 11 federal requirement that airport security screeners be
U.S. citizens.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on behalf
of nine California screeners, argues that the citizenship requirement
is "irrational" and actually could weaken airport security by
removing thousands of experienced employees from the system.</LD>
<LD>   The change is set to be phased in over the next 10 months, with
all screeners to be citizens and federal employees by Nov. 19.</LD>
<TE>   An estimated 25% of the 28,000 pre-boarding screeners at the
nation's airports are not citizens but legal permanent residents. At
some airports, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Miami and Dulles
in Washington, noncitizens account for a majority of the work force.
About 40% of the screeners at Los Angeles International Airport are
noncitizens.</TE>
<TE>   The suit notes that no such requirement exists for airline pilots,
flight attendants, baggage handlers or for the National Guard troops
now stationed at airports to beef up security.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include a U.S. Army veteran and several
screeners who have received commendations for their work. "I was
deeply hurt when I heard about this law, because it cuts across the
very fabric of what makes America great and special," said Vicente
Crisologo, a screener at San Francisco International Airport who came
to the United States from the Philippines three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   One of three named plaintiffs who spoke at a news conference
Thursday at ACLU offices in Los Angeles, Crisologo came close to
tears as he decried the "unfair and discriminatory" requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Mitchell, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation,
said he could not comment on the lawsuit, which he had not yet seen.
However, he noted that the citizenship requirement was explicitly
written into the new airport security law that passed Congress with
overwhelming bipartisan support.</TE>
<TE>   He said the department is working with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to speed up processing for screeners who have
already applied for citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Service Employees International Union, which
represents about 2,000 airport screeners and is a party in the
lawsuit, said many screeners can't apply for citizenship because they
have not been in the country for five years.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit contends that the requirement violates constitutional
guarantees of due process because it discriminates against a class of
people for no rational reason.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the ACLU of Southern California,
said he hoped the lawsuit would prompt Congress to strike the
citizenship requirement. "This matter ought not to go to court," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear who would propose such a bill and how much support
it would have in a Congress that has been eager to show itself to be
strong on security. However, there are several outspoken critics of
the citizenship requirement.</TE>
<TE>   The provision "does nothing to enhance security, and it is going
to eliminate some competent and totally trustworthy people," said
Rep. Howard Berman (D-Mission Hills). "I could see a compromise that
talked about allowing permanent resident aliens who are working now
in this area and who are otherwise qualified under the new system to
keep their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell of the DOT said U.S. citizenship is just one of many
stringent qualifications for future screeners. They also must have
high levels of written and verbal English proficiency, visual and
oral acuity, and an ability to respond to alarms in noisy and chaotic
circumstances. Screeners will have 40 hours of classroom instruction
and 60 hours of practical experience before taking on an assignment,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said pay for trainees will start in the mid-$20,000s and
salaries probably will average in the mid-$30,000s, far higher that
current rates.</TE>
<TE>   "We are creating a career force of federal transportation security
personnel, a group that has esprit de corps like any uniformed
force."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Henry Weinstein contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Union Membership Steady in 2001 at 13.5% of Nation's Work
Force</HD>
<DH>Labor: Rise in rolls is offset by layoffs, keeping movement
from significantly boosting numbers.</DH>

<LD>Union membership increased slightly last year, allowing organized
labor to maintain a 13.5% share of the U.S. work force despite a wave
of layoffs but underscoring the movement's failure to substantially
add to its numbers.</LD>
<LD>   The Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual count of union members,
released Thursday, showed that 16.28 million wage and salary workers
were members of unions in 2001, a barely perceptible increase from
the 16.26 million in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Government employees were far more likely to belong to a union
than workers in the private sector, where only about 10% of employees
were unionized. Police officers, firefighters and other
protective-service workers had the highest unionization rate, about
38%.</LD>
<TE>   John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, which represents
13million union members, said federation records show that 400,000
workers joined unions last year but that growth was offset by layoffs
in union jobs. Sweeney has said unions need to organize 500,000 to 1
million workers to regain strength.</TE>
<TE>   The union membership rate has fallen from a high of 20.1% in 1983,
the first year for which comparable data are available, the bureau
said. Among demographic groups, it said, blacks were more likely to
be union members, at 17%, than whites (13.1%) or Hispanics (11.3%).</TE>

<HD>G. Van der Kemp, 89; Led Restoration of Versailles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gerald Van der Kemp, a French curator who raised millions to preserve
and restore the 17th century palace of Versailles outside Paris after
decades of neglect, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Van der Kemp died at American Hospital in Paris on Dec. 28. The
cause of death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Called by a French magazine "The Man Who Gave Us Back Versailles,"
Van der Kemp focused nearly 30 years of his life on returning the
palace and grounds to their former sumptuous glory, tracking down
lost artwork and supervising repairs, replantings and restoration of
priceless paintings.</LD>
<TE>   He was legendary for his fund-raising skills and traveled
regularly to the United States with his American-born wife, Florence,
to cajole wealthy Americans into supporting Versailles' renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "He invented the act of fund-raising by really using only his
social connections, which were enormous, on both sides of the
Atlantic," said J. Patrice Marandel, chief curator of European art at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Van der Kemp also supervised the restoration of Claude Monet's
home in Giverny, a project that took four years and cost $2.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Born to a family of Dutch origin in Charenton-le-Pont outside
Paris, he studied at the Ecole du Louvre and the Institute of Arts
and Archaeology. In 1936, he became an assistant curator at the
Louvre.</TE>
<TE>   His background landed him an assignment during World War II to
protect French masterpieces, including Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona
Lisa," at a secret chateau in southwestern France. After Paris was
liberated, he personally carried the Mona Lisa up the steps of the
Louvre.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, he went to Versailles as a curator. He found a decrepit
heap: Staircases were sagging, the rooms were empty, and rain poured
through the roofs to the basements. Nothing had been spent on palace
upkeep for 80 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in terrible condition," he recalled in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to repair the structure before we could recover the art."</TE>
<TE>   The latter task became a global treasure hunt.</TE>
<TE>   When the court at Versailles was disbanded during the French
Revolution, the contents were moved to Paris, then sold at auction in
1792 and 1793 and scattered to museums and private collections all
over the world.</TE>
<TE>   Van der Kemp contacted other curators and scoured auction catalogs
from around the world to see if they had something for his palace.</TE>
<TE>   Edmond de Rothschild contributed Riesener commodes made for
Marie-Antoinette, and Barbara Hutton gave a Savonnerie carpet so fine
that the curator kept it rolled up when the public came to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Some works could not be recovered for Versailles, including the
Mona Lisa, Mantegna's "Entombment" and Giorgione's "Musicians." Many
furnishings could not be replicated in their original, costly
materials.</TE>
<TE>   In the Hall of Mirrors, for example, Van der Kemp talked a San
Francisco donor into giving $18,000 for a chandelier to be made in
the Louis XV style, but other fixtures for the famous room were
reproduced using plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, even as an approximation of grand siecle splendor,
the results were considered a spectacular success.</TE>
<TE>   Van der Kemp "may not have been the greatest expert on Versailles
or the greatest scholar," said Marandel. "He left the nitty-gritty of
researching the archives, knowing what kind of silk should be woven,
to the experts. He was simply raising an awful lot of money to do all
these things. He was an enabler on a grand, grand scale."</TE>
<TE>   To court prospective donors and thank those already swayed by his
charms, Van der Kemp held intimate soirees and lavish balls at the
palace. His wife, a former Washington society columnist, applied her
considerable skills as a hostess to each event and also managed the
Versailles Foundation, which was set up to receive contributions. She
lived with her husband in a 21-room wing of the palace originally
occupied by one of Louis XIV's ministers.</TE>
<TE>   Van der Kemp--tall, with an aquiline nose and carefully arranged
hair, who always wore a boutonniere and a splash of gold--
"identified himself totally with Louis XIV," Marandel said.</TE>
<TE>   More than $70 million has been spent on redoing Versailles. Much
of the money Van der Kemp raised came from deep-pocketed Americans,
such as cosmetics maven Estee Lauder, MCA founder Dr. Jules Stein,
and various Rockefellers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of friends in America who love French art," he once
said. "I never ask for money, but they see someone who has spent all
his life restoring beauties and they give me money."</TE>
<TE>   If necessary, the curator appealed to their patriotism.
"Versailles," he would say, "was the cradle of your revolution and it
is thanks to Louis XIV that you are free."</TE>
<TE>   Van der Kemp is survived by his wife, and a son, Frank.</TE>

<HD>Angels Get a Healthy Hitter</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Fullmer, who has never been on disabled list, is
acquired from Blue Jays to fill hole at designated hitter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Fullmer is accustomed to big events marking his birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Eight years ago on Jan. 17, Fullmer was awakened in Studio City by
the Northridge earthquake. Last year, he signed his first multiyear
major league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays.</LD>
<LD>   And on Thursday, as Fullmer turned 27, he got a going-away gift
from the Blue Jays, who traded the designated hitter to the Angels in
exchange for pitcher Brian Cooper.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a West Coast guy, a California guy," said Fullmer, a Van Nuys
Montclair Prep graduate who batted .274 with 18 home runs and 83 runs
batted in last season. "It just seems like a perfect fit for me."</TE>
<TE>   The trade for Fullmer probably completes the Angels' off-season
shopping, General Manager Bill Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   On consecutive days in late December, the Angels signed free-agent
pitcher Aaron Sele and acquired pitcher Kevin Appier from the New
York Mets in a trade for first baseman Mo Vaughn. Outfielder Darin
Erstad signed a one-year, $6.25-million contract on Wednesday, and
the club announced the Fullmer trade 24 hours later.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also announced that they avoided arbitration by coming
to terms with reliever Al Levine on a one-year contract. Terms were
not disclosed. Levine made $715,000 last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really very much better rounded than we've been since I've
been here," Stoneman said. "We'll continue to talk to other general
managers--that goes on year-around--but I'm happy with the way it
looks."</TE>
<TE>   So is Fullmer, a left-handed batter who played parts of three
seasons with the Montreal Expos before he was traded to the Blue Jays
in a three-way deal with the Texas Rangers on March 16, 2000. Fullmer
had a breakthrough season in 2000 when he hit .295 with 32 homers and
104 RBIs in 133 games for the Blue Jays. He said he tried to do too
much last season and faltered at times.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the year, I was pressing, putting too much pressure on
myself to duplicate that year in 2000," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Fullmer were not to recapture the form of his best year,
he is expected to provide a big boost over what the Angels got from
their designated hitters last season. The 15 players who filled that
role batted only .212 with franchise-lows of 121 hits, eight home
runs and 56 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman had been seeking a big hitter since the Vaughn trade and
said he had discussions with several free agents when the possibility
of acquiring Fullmer arose last week.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy who's been a productive hitter. He's still young and
improving," Stoneman said. "He's going to be a big part of our
offense next year."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer has never been on the disabled list and was available
probably because of his salary. He is in the final year of a
two-year, $6.5-million contract and will make $3.75-million this
season. He cannot become a free agent until he plays three more
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Ricciardi, who took over as general manager of the Blue Jays
in November, has traded closer Billy Koch to Oakland, shortstop Alex
Gonzalez to the Chicago Cubs and reliever Paul Quantrill to the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't speak for the GM, the first time I spoke to him was this
afternoon," Fullmer said. "It looks like, based on some of the moves
they have made, that they are trying to cut down salary and give some
young guys a chance to play."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer thinks he is a good fit in the Angel lineup and called the
club, "a team on the rise." He said he is capable of playing first
base, if needed, but has had his best seasons as a DH.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to keep doing what I've done--come to play and be
prepared and bust my butt every day. No one is going to outwork me,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The signing of Levine leaves the Angels with only one player
eligible for arbitration, first baseman Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, 27, is a former USC star who pitched in parts of three big
league seasons with the Angels. He was 5-10 with a 5.33 earned-run
average in 27 games. He was 0-1 with a 2.63 ERA in one start and six
relief appearances last season.</TE>

<HD>Venus Finds She Has a Leg to Stand On</HD>
<DH>Tennis: After shaky start, Williams' ailing knee passes
test in third-round win at Australian Open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>It took Venus Williams about 15 minutes to realize she would have to
win this third-round match on two legs, not one. One healthy knee
might be adequate against players ranked outside the top 30, but
Daniela Hantuchova had just enough power to force Williams out of her
comfort zone.</LD>
<LD>   Williams lost the first four games in 15 minutes and promptly
turned into a different player, running full out and testing her
aching left knee, beset with tendinitis. The second version of Venus
was enough to offset the initial cautious Venus as she defeated the
Slovakian teenager, 3-6, 6-0, 6-4, in 1 hour 47 minutes today at the
Australian Open.</LD>
<LD>   Hantuchova, seeded 32nd but ranked 28th, has plenty of talent but
little experience at Grand Slam events. This was her first
third-round appearance at a major.</LD>
<TE>   The second-seeded Williams, though hampered by an ailing knee, is
the reigning Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion and the victory put her
winning streak at 23 matches. Her immense talent and experience
compensated for any physical weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew what kind of player she was," Williams said. "After the
first set, I settled in, got comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Her intense discomfort in the second round against Kristina Brandi
cast doubt over her title run. But Williams skipped practice on her
off day, received treatment and consulted with members of her
entourage about whether to play today's match. "Ice is my best friend
now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked with my mom, dad, [sister] Serena, too," Williams said.
"Everybody. I took yesterday off. They told me too. The main battle
was getting the swelling down. It's really a blessing I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova subscribed to the experience theory. The hard-hitting
baseliner has defeated the likes of Jelena Dokic, Amanda Coetzer and
Meghann Shaughnessy and has come close against the very best, leading
Jennifer Capriati, 7-5, 4-1, before losing to her last summer in
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really happy with the way I played the first set," she
said. "I was moving her around and my serve felt pretty good. It's a
shame I started badly in the second set. She got on the top of my
game. In the third, I had many chances to go 4-3, 5-4, and a couple
easy mistakes, a bit of inexperience cost me the match."</TE>
<TE>   In one stretch, from the start of the second set, Williams won
eight straight games, taking the second, 6-0, and building a 2-0 lead
in the third.</TE>
<TE>   She let Hantuchova back into the third set, and the Slovak had a
point to go up, 5-4, but smacked a forehand about an inch wide.
Williams, who had seven aces and four double faults, held at 15 to
reach a fourth-round match against 13th-seeded Magdalena Maleeva of
Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   Said Williams: "You always go into a match a little nervous after
you've had a scare. I felt very good today. I felt like I could move.
She had a few drop shots I didn't run for at first."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest threat in Williams' quarter of the draw is No. 8
Monica Seles. Seles, a four-time champion here, defeated No. 31
Francesca Schiavone of Italy, 6-4, 6-4. In three matches, Seles has
lost 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   In other third-round matches today, one more American exited.
Qualifier Alex Kim, who upset former champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia in the second round, was outclassed by Chilean qualifier
Fernando Gonzalez. Gonzalez beat Kim, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3. Gonzalez hit 48
winners, including 11 aces, to just 10 winners for Kim.</TE>
<TE>   One set stood between wild-card entrant Taylor Dent of Newport
Beach and a spot in the final 16, but a double fault on break point
in the sixth game of the fifth set cost him dearly against Adrian
Voinea of Romania.</TE>
<TE>   Voinea defeated crowd favorite Dent, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, in 2
hours 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly did not come easily as Voinea fought off two break
points when he served for the match at 5-3. He won it on his first
match point when Dent chipped a backhand return wide. Dent had 14
aces and double faulted six times.</TE>
<TE>   Since it has become well-known that Australia and the United
States are vying for the Davis Cup services of Dent, the 20-year-old
has been embraced by fans here. His father, Phil Dent, an Australian,
reached the final of this event in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it does appear as though Dent will end up playing for the
U.S., and he said earlier this week that he is leaning that way.</TE>
<TE>   Television commentator John Alexander, who is Dent's godfather and
an Australian Davis Cup legend, found it hard to control his emotions
during the match.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I'm trying to be objective, but it's an interesting
experience," said Alexander, who was also Phil Dent's doubles
partner.</TE>

<LD>Gary Sheffield arrived in Atlanta wearing earrings in both lobes--a
no-no when he takes the field in a Brave uniform.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no problem taking 'em off," Sheffield said Thursday,
beaming as he donned a Brave cap and jersey for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after being acquired from the Dodgers, Sheffield showed
up at Turner Field to meet with team officials and introduce himself
to a city he considers his second hometown.</LD>
<TE>   "This has been a long time coming," said Sheffield, who actually
lives in Tampa, Fla. "My dream has come true."</TE>
<TE>   After a series of well-publicized skirmishes with Dodger
management, including trade demands and acerbic accusations,
Sheffield vowed that he won't be a disruptive force in the Atlanta
clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fresh start for me," Sheffield said. "I want to make
this clear: I want to fit in with my teammates, get along with the
media and do my part."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield was acquired from the Dodgers for Brian Jordan, Odalis
Perez and a minor league pitcher.</TE>

<LD>   No. 13 Gonzaga (15-2, 2-0) at Pepperdine (9-6, 2-0), 7:30, Fox
Sports Net, KPLS (830)--Although the Waves have victories over No. 9
UCLA and No. 18 USC, this is their biggest game to date because of
its impact on the West Coast Conference race. The winner will gain
sole possession of first place. Gonzaga brings a 12-game winning
streak into the game, which is sold out, and has not lost since
dropping a 72-63 decision to Marquette on Nov. 24. Senior guard Dan
Dickau, who is averaging a WCC-best 19.4 points, will draw most of
the attention from Pepperdine's pressure defense. Pepperdine, which
has won four in a row since a loss at Arizona, relies on a balanced,
up-tempo attack and a ball-hawking defense that is forcing an average
of 19.1 turnovers and limited St. Mary's and San Francisco to a
combined 32.7% shooting in road victories last weekend. Junior
forward Jimmy Miggins and freshman guard Terrance Johnson lead the
Waves in scoring with averages of 14.9 and 14.5, respectively.</LD>

<TE>   Portland (4-12, 0-2) at Loyola Marymount (8-8, 1-1), 7, KXLU-FM
(88.9)--Loyola lost at San Francisco and defeated St. Mary's last
weekend in its first two West Coast Conference games. The Lions rank
second in the conference, shooting 45.9%. Portland has lost eight
games in a row. The Pilots, who are coached by former UCLA player and
assistant Michael Holton, lost to San Diego and Santa Clara last
weekend. Loyola continues its WCC schedule Saturday against Gonzaga.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Minneapolis judge is considering whether the University of
Minnesota can seek punitive damages in addition to the $1.5 million
it's trying to recover from a buyout for coach Clem Haskins amid an
academic fraud scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The university is suing Haskins, claiming he committed fraud when
he said he had no role in the 1999 scandal. The case is scheduled to
go to trial April 22. Haskins' attorney has said the terms of the
buyout deal released Haskins from any obligation to the school.</LD>
<LD>   Lorie Gildea, a university attorney, declined to say how much the
school seeks in damages.</LD>
<TE>   West Virginia freshman guard Jonathan Hargett had arthroscopic
surgery to remove torn cartilage in his right knee and will miss up
to two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-11 Hargett has played with an inflamed knee most of the
season but did not tell the team until a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Hargett, a preseason All-Big East rookie selection, has started 12
games, averaging 14.4 points and 5.4 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard A.W. Hamilton, who played only 30 minutes in four
games for No. 14 Wake Forest this season, has transferred to
Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton will be eligible for the second semester next season and
have two years of eligibility.</TE>

<HD>Diaz Is Looking to Gain From Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The toughest part of an up-and-coming boxer's first defeat isn't
necessarily the loss itself. It's the road back and how he navigates
it.</LD>
<LD>   Julio Diaz, 22, had the momentum on his side last summer. His
sterling and unblemished resume spoke volumes and an impending title
shot was on the horizon. And, he said, a $1.3-million contract offer
from HBO was staring him squarely in the face.</LD>
<LD>   All the lightweight from Coachella had to do was get by an aging
and seemingly shot Angel Manfredy.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   After a controversial 12-round split decision loss to Manfredy in
Corpus Christi, Texas, on Oct. 6, the resume was sullied, the title
shot put on hold and the cable giant's big contract offer withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt this big," Diaz said, pinching his right forefinger next
to his thumb.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Top Rank Chairman Bob Arum.</TE>
<TE>   "In a strange way, it was probably a blessing in disguise, that
outrageous decision," the promoter said. "It slowed him up and took
him off that fast track and maybe he wasn't ready. But probably in
six months, he'll be more mature."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz is still considered main-event material for his first fight
since the disconcerting loss. Diaz (23-1, 17 knockouts) was chosen to
headline the first two-hour show in the New Generation series
broadcast by Telefutura, a new Univision network.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a title shot, Diaz will make his Los Angeles-area debut
by facing journeyman Verdell Smith (40-36-1, 17 knockouts) of
Oklahoma City at the Hollywood Palladium tonight in a scheduled
10-rounder after previous opponent Carlos Ramirez withdrew following
a car accident last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the brightest young prospect out there," Arum said of Diaz.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz is ranked fifth among 130-pounders by the International
Boxing Federation, sixth by the World Boxing Council, seventh by the
World Boxing Organization and 14th by the World Boxing Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz didn't have to look far to get inspiration on how to bounce
back from a loss.</TE>
<TE>   His older brother, Antonio, lost a title shot in November 2000,
going down in six rounds to WBC welterweight champion Shane Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   But Antonio didn't let the knockout loss become the start of a
downward spiral. Rather, he will again fight for a belt, the WBO's
vacant welterweight title against Antonio Margarito in March.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't even know it, but that's how I want to do it," Julio
said of how his brother has handled himself since getting knocked
out. "I'm inspired by him."</TE>
<TE>   Said Antonio: "Some fighters lose and they don't come back. They
get all bummed and they don't come back strong."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Espinoza, the Diaz brothers' long-term manager and trainer,
said he's not worried about Julio.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no, Julio is something special," Espinoza said. "He didn't get
hurt, nothing. First of all, Angel did not fight. If Angel would have
fought, he would have got knocked out. He was just doing things like
a crybaby. Such a big guy calling himself 'El Diablo' and being such
a crybaby. The last low punch wasn't a low punch. ... The referee
says fight and he goes, 'Ay, he hit me, low blow.' And the referee
took away a point."</TE>
<TE>   CompuBox numbers from the fight showed Diaz was the busier and
more effective fighter, landing 22% (293 of 1,306) of his punches,
compared to the 19% (194 of 997) of Manfredy. But referee Barry Yeats
penalized Diaz one point in the fourth and ninth rounds for low
blows. A warning was never issued before either deduction.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd lustily booed the judges' scores--115-112 and 114-112
for Manfredy, 114-112 for Diaz--and the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Julio's going to bounce back like nothing," Espinoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, born in Huiquilpan, Mexico and the married father of two
daughters, is building an international following and is asked to
address media throngs in English and Spanish to better market
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Diaz, who's comfortable fighting from either his natural
right side or as a southpaw, said he's hungrier mentally than ever
before. Especially after losing out on the title shot and HBO
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of time. ... I'll be back," he said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turning its rebounding advantage into a fast break clinic, No. 19
Stanford ran itself to an easy victory at Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   Casey Jacobsen and Curtis Borchardt each scored 15 points and the
Cardinal remained unbeaten at home with an 83-50 victory over
Washington State on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   "That was our best fast break all year bar none," Jacobsen said.
"It was nice to get some easy baskets like that and stretch it out."</LD>
<TE>   Julius Barnes had 12 points as the Cardinal, 10-4 overall and 3-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference, broke out of a slump that saw it win
only three of its previous six games.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, the conference's top rebounding team, was able to get
several easy baskets--16 points in the first half on layups and
dunks--to open a wide margin early. The Cardinal never trailed in
increasing its home record this season to 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a nice confidence booster for us," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "Believe it or not, we needed a confidence booster."</TE>
<TE>   The fast-paced offense helped the Cardinal shoot 50% from the
field, including a combined 11 for 16 by Borchardt and Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State (4-11, 0-7) lost its 11th in a row to Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   St. John's 64, No. 22 Boston College 57--Marcus Hatten had 18
points and eight assists at Boston for the Red Storm (12-4, 3-2 in
the Big East), which fell behind, 16-2, before rallying for its third
victory in as many games against ranked teams.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Sidney scored 20 points and Troy Bell and Uka Agbai each had
12 for Boston College (13-4, 2-3), which has lost its last three home
games after winning the previous 25. In the three losses, Bell made
one of 18 three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   California 62, Washington 50--Joe Shipp scored 18 points, and
freshman Jamal Sampson had 15 points and a season-high 17 rebounds as
the Golden Bears won at Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   California (12-3, 3-2 in the Pac-10) improved to 11-0 at home.
Doug Wrenn scored 19 points to lead Washington (7-10, 1-6).</TE>

2 Tennessee (15-1, 4-0 in the Southeastern Conference) won its 26th
consecutive game over No. 8 South Carolina (16-2, 4-1) with an 80-61

<HD>Gentry Offers Some Ideas on Road Woes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry hopes his team will take some hard-earned
lessons from their 1-5 trip.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't play well in Philly, and we didn't play well in New
Jersey," Gentry said after Thursday's shortened practice. "We played
well enough in Washington that, if we had come up with some plays
we'd have had a chance to win. And Charlotte was a total disaster. We
played well in Toronto. And at Minnesota, they are playing at such a
high level I'm not sure anyone could go in there and beat them.</LD>
<LD>   "I want us to understand that if we go out and play with
confidence, we're a good enough team to win on the road. That's what
we have to continue to work on as a young team. The big thing is,
even with the road trip we had, we didn't bury ourselves to where
we're out of the playoffs, or so far back we can't recover."</LD>
<TE>   Gentry also said the Tuesday morning scuffle between Elton Brand,
Obinna Ekezie and Corey Maggette in Minneapolis would cost all three
some money but no other disciplinary action was required.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we don't condone violence at all," Gentry said. "Those
guys will get fined, but that's something that's handled internally.
If you talk to the parties involved they're more embarrassed than
anything. But as far as I'm concerned, it's a dead issue."</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Cavaliers (2000-01)--2-0</TE>
<TE>   Update--Cleveland, which lost its eighth in a row, 117-88, to
Golden State on Wednesday, can commiserate with the Clippers about
life on the road. The Cavaliers are 4-17 away from home. Clipper
forward Lamar Odom's sprained right wrist makes him questionable
tonight. "He's probably going to go, but he's in that situation where
it just bothers him," Gentry said. "As long as I think he's
effective, he'll be out there. We've got to have him on the floor."</TE>

<HD>Williams Is Unstoppable, So Is Duke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The look on Jason Williams' face at Duke's shootaround was one Chris
Duhon has seen before.</LD>
<LD>   "It was, 'Give me the ball,'" Duhon said. "I saw it in his eyes."</LD>
<LD>   So did Maryland's Steve Blake--at least for the few moments he
could keep Williams in front of him Thursday night.</LD>
<TE>   After a pell-mell 99-78 victory against the No. 3 Terrapins in
front of  9,314 at Cameron Indoor Stadium, the latest game in the now
epic-series between Duke and Maryland belongs to the No. 1 Blue
Devils</TE>
<TE>   It was a game that will look like a blowout, but felt very little
like one until the end.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, almost unstoppable off the dribble, scored 34
points--more amazing for the fact that he made only one three-point
basket, getting most of his points off explosive drives to the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, yeah," Williams said, a smile creeping across his face.
"Yeah, for some reason, I really wanted the ball in my hands."</TE>
<TE>   He made 13 of 23 shots and added eight assists and seven rebounds.
Mike Dunleavy scored 21 points, 19 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland, which had beaten Duke in its last two trips to Cameron,
traded punches with the Blue Devils for the first 20 minutes and led,
49-48, at halftime, partly because of the bruising play of Lonny
Baxter, who scored 24 points before fouling out.</TE>
<TE>   But Duke overwhelmed Maryland in the second half, chiefly because
of a single-handed 9-0 run by Williams that helped open a 10-point
lead, then two daggers from Dunleavy after Maryland cut the lead to
73-70.</TE>
<TE>   The rivalry is one that has grown quickly and fiercely as
Maryland's program has become a national contender--and
coincidentally, as rival North Carolina has suddenly plunged below
.500 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Duke and Maryland played four times last season, and Duke won
three--the last one in the Final Four, roaring back from a 22-point
deficit to advance to the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   In another victory, the Blue Devils rallied from a 10-point
deficit with a minute left in regulation to win in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Williams--a hero in so many games and a goat for missing late free
throws in Duke's stunning loss to Florida State--dominated from wire
to wire.</TE>
<TE>   "He did what he did from the beginning," Duhon said. "He didn't
wait for any late heroics."</TE>
<TE>   Williams made seven of his 10 free throws too, but it wasn't
necessary: Maryland had no answer for his dribble penetration, trying
Blake, then Juan Dixon and Drew Nicholas.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-point game was his third of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland's Dixon--held to 10 points, barely half his average--said
the Terrapins tried to guard Williams on the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   But when they closed on him, Williams went by.</TE>
<TE>   Duhon has seen him do that plenty.</TE>
<TE>   "When Jason is in that zone and has that look, I don't think
anybody in the country can stay in front of him," Duhon said.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Williams almost seemed to toy with the defender before
darting by with a crossover dribble.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just getting a read, seeing what his best option is," Duhon
said. "He's so quick and such a good ballhandler, he kind of dribbles
you to sleep. You let up for a split-second and he's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Maryland (13-3) had been carried to victory in its last two visits
to Cameron on the shoulders of Dixon, but he couldn't carry the
Terrapins this time--partly because of the defense of Duke's Dahntay
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "Juan, of all the kids who don't play for Duke, he's my favorite
player," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "I admire him immensely.
He's a warrior. He missed some shots and we played good defense. But
he could go for 40 next time."</TE>
<TE>   There will be a next time--and maybe more than one.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more battles to come," Williams said. "I'm sure there
will be two--maybe even three."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Duke (15-1) is reinvigorated--and its claim to No. 1 firm
after recovering from the loss to Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   When the Blue Devils returned to Cameron after that game,
Krzyzewski had ordered changes in the locker room. The players'
chairs were taken away, their name plates and pictures taken down.</TE>
<TE>   The chairs were back Thursday, but the walls around the players'
stalls were bare.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine with Williams for now.</TE>
<TE>   "This team had let complacency set in," he said. "We wanted to
win, but we wanted to put forth the least amount of effort to win. We
don't want to become that team."</TE>

<HD>Parssinen Gets Another Opportunity</HD>

<LD>Mighty Duck officials had their fingers crossed when they gave right
wing Timo Parssinen a spot on their top line at the start of the
season. It was a gamble and the Ducks went bust.</LD>
<LD>   Parssinen had one assist in three games, and that on a fluke
deflection, then was sent down to Cincinnati. He returned for three
more games in late November, then went back to the minors.</LD>
<LD>   Now he's back and Coach Bryan Murray said Parssinen probably will
get a longer look. Parssinen started Wednesday's game against
Buffalo, skating on the second line for the injured Jeff Friesen
(sprained left ankle). He was neither impressive nor a disaster,
playing 11 minutes 32 seconds and getting off two shots.</LD>
<TE>   "He looks more comfortable and more confident," Murray said.
"There were times early in the year when he wasn't as sure of
himself. That had to do with me a little because I started him on
Paul [Kariya's] line. That's a lot of pressure."</TE>

<HD>Rookie, 31, Has a Blast for Eagle and the Lead</HD>
<DH>Golf: Australian Senden is one clear of the field after 36
holes, but there are still plenty of birdies to be made in the
desert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>After two rounds of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, your leader is a
31-year-old Australian playing his second tournament of a
two-week-old PGA Tour career, who finished his 65 at Indian Wells by
holing a bunker shot for an eagle.</LD>
<LD>   It was John Senden's day Thursday at the shooting gallery, but not
by much. Senden's back-to-back rounds of 64-65 sent him to 15 under
par, one shot ahead of Brandel Chamblee and two ahead of Phil
Mickelson and Jay Haas.</LD>
<LD>   Because there are 24 players within five shots of Senden, this
tournament probably isn't going to be decided until the final putt
falls into the 90th hole Sunday ... yes, good to the last drop.</LD>
<TE>   Chamblee, who had a 67 at Bermuda Dunes, tried to answer the
question everybody is asking: "Who knows what the scores are going to
be ... 30 under? Who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, who knows John Senden? He earned his tour card at
qualifying school after playing in Europe the last four years and
says his putting has been improving steadily. Senden says when he's
going good, it's all in his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "The best part of my putting routine has just been the mental
approach into the putt, just looking, feeling and just running it
off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, who had a 67, could have been closer to the leader, but
he bogeyed the last hole at Bermuda Dunes when he drove under some
trees and couldn't get up and down from just short of the green.</TE>
<TE>   "Not disappointing," Mickelson said of his day, which is a lot
different than, say, wildly exciting. There was certainly a lot of
that stuff going around, and in any direction you looked.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell shot a 32 on the back nine at the Palmer Course for
a 67 and moved into a tie for fifth at 12-under 132. Howell is joined
by Greg Kraft, who shot a 31 on the back nine at Bermuda Dunes on his
way to a 65. Steve Elkington had a 65 at Indian Wells to equal Howell
and Kraft and also Heath Slocum. Scott McCarron posted a 65 at
Bermuda Dunes to tie seven others at 133. Kenny Perry had a 64 at
Tamarisk, but Fred Funk's 63 at Indian Wells was the low score of the
day.</TE>
<TE>   Howell says there isn't anything not to like about golf in perfect
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like playing in a dome," he said. "And the roof is closed."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Hope is wide open, which is to be expected. Haas
followed his opening 63 with a four-under 68 at Bermuda Dunes and
must have felt like he was getting windburn from everybody passing
him. The philosophy is different now than when he won the Hope in
1988, Haas said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to go low every single day now and there's no
such thing as kind of holding and protecting your lead," he said. "I
shot 22 under when I won and I ended up winning by two. A 22 under
this year might finish 25th or something."</TE>
<TE>   Senden says he is going to go out and relax and play his game and
not worry about what everyone else is doing. It's a nice approach, a
lot easier to take when you eagle the closing hole. Senden's
four-iron second shot found a bunker on the right side.</TE>
<TE>   "I just splashed it out and it dropped right in the middle," he
said. "I was a happy man."</TE>

<HD>Steward Merits Award</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the guys in the trenches got his due Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Moved by uncommon brilliance, the Eclipse Awards people announced
that they were giving Pete Pedersen--a racetrack steward, no
less--the Award of Merit for lifetime contributions to the sport.</LD>
<LD>   The only previous steward to win this award was Kentucky's Keene
Daingerfield, in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   The Award of Merit is usually reserved for high-profile jockeys
(Bill Shoemaker, Steve Cauthen), moneybags horse owners (Paul Mellon,
Fred Hooper), longtime track executives (Bob Strub, Jimmy Kilroe) and
media icons (Joe Hirsch, Jim McKay).</TE>
<TE>   Usually, all racing stewards get is grief. One horse bumps
another, and while reviewing the rerun the stewards must talk to the
jockeys on the phone, knowing full well that whatever their decision,
there will be a segment of bettors downstairs tearing up tickets,
cursing the stewards and their luck, in that order.</TE>
<TE>   The public may not know that refereeing eight or nine races a day
is only a small part of a steward's job. The day starts much earlier,
when scratches for the races start coming in and entries are
submitted for the next racing card.</TE>
<TE>   In between, stewards draw the demarcation line in a potentially
chaotic world.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled jockeys and their lawyers show up, asking for another
license and one more chance. A trainer offers to pay his overdue
veterinary bill, if only they can give him a little more time. There
are hearings upon hearings, marathon sessions punctuated by trainers
proclaiming their innocence and chemists waving evidence of drugged
horses.</TE>
<TE>   The paperwork is boundless. Culprits can always appeal, to the
California Horse Racing Board and then the civil courts, and if
you're a steward, you'd better have your Ts crossed and I's dotted
when the infighting gets to that level.</TE>
<TE>   Pedersen, 81 last July 4, has been knocking around this milieu for
more than half a century. A career racetracker, he's been a steward
since 1948. Since 1955, tracks all over California have been graced
with his even-handed approach.</TE>
<TE>   You don't become a steward to make friends, yet somehow Pedersen
has been able to do that. All those post-race dinners at The Derby,
George Woolf's old restaurant near Santa Anita, and not once has
Pedersen felt imperiled by a seat with his back to the door.</TE>
<TE>   The tough race calls he remembers best are the ones that riled the
most blood.</TE>
<TE>   He felt trainer Charlie Whittingham's ire after Pedersen and his
two associates disqualified Perrault and hung up John Henry's number
in the 1982 Santa Anita Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The same race, 12 years later, brought a cascade of boos when The
Wicked North was disqualified in favor of Stuka, who had been beaten
by almost two lengths. Most surprised person at the track was Gary
Jones, the trainer of Stuka.</TE>
<TE>   "To put it mildly, The Wicked North's DQ wasn't well-received,"
Pedersen said. "We tried very hard to let the result stand. But we
just couldn't."</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 Santa Anita Handicap was a $1-million race, but at
Hollywood Park in 1984, the day of the first Breeders' Cup, there
were seven races with $10 million in purses on the line, and two of
them were decided in the stewards' stand.</TE>
<TE>   Fran's Valentine was disqualified and Outstandingly moved up to
first in the Juvenile Fillies.</TE>
<TE>   Then in the Classic, which at $3 million was the richest
thoroughbred race ever run, Wild Again's win was allowed to
stand--although Gate Dancer was penalized from second to third
place--in the roughhouse, three-horse finish.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fran's Valentine decision wasn't difficult because the foul
was flagrant," Pedersen said. "But what made it unusual was that the
winner didn't bother Outstandingly at all. The horse she fouled
[Pirate's Glow] finished far back."</TE>
<TE>   For 24 hours, the owners of Gate Dancer and Slew O' Gold, the
Classic's third-place finisher, considered appeals, but they finally
backed off.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to say to yourself that judging one race is no different
than any other, and the amount of the purse doesn't matter," Pedersen
said. "But you'd have to be crazy if you really believed that."</TE>
<TE>   Pedersen recalled how owner Earl Scheib took Fran's Valentine's
disqualification.</TE>
<TE>   "He was asked later what he did," Pedersen said. "Earl told them
that he just had another drink and went home."</TE>

<LD>On most days, the pick six at Gulfstream Park is easy to ignore.</LD>
<LD>   For whatever reason, the wager isn't popular at the Florida track
and the pool, on non-carryover days, is usually minuscule when
compared to what players are used to seeing in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Things are a bit different today, however. Gulfstream is offering
a $25,000 guaranteed pool in the pick six every Friday during its
meet, which runs until late April, and the takeout on the bet is
reduced to 20% instead of the usual 25%.</LD>
<TE>   This means players can start with a pick six back east, then come
right back at Santa Anita, which has an $83,389.71 carryover after
Thursday, when the best anyone could do in Arcadia was five winners.</TE>
<TE>   The fields for the Gulfstream Park races are large. Nine are
scheduled to go in the fifth, a six-furlong sprint for $30,000
claimers; 12 were entered in the sixth, a route for maiden claimers;
an overflow 14 were entered in the seventh, an allowance race for
fillies and mares on the turf; 13 signed up for the eighth, a
seven-furlong allowance; eight are supposed to go in the $100,000
First Lady Handicap, a Grade III sprint for older fillies and mares,
and the day will wrap up with a full field (14 were entered) of
fillies and mares going 11/16 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   The First Lady could set up well for the late-running Cat Cay, who
has won two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Anita, the most logical pick six single could be
Cashmina, the 9-5 favorite in the fifth. She was much troubled in her
debut, when she was the 4-5 choice, and could make amends against
seven opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Glorious Linda is the 5-2 morning-line favorite
in the third, a nine-furlong turf race for older fillies and mares
and the first leg of the local pick six. The 8-year-old mare has won
six times over the Santa Anita grass, but is winless in five previous
tries at 11/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Pooh Bear. The Candi's Gold filly, who lost her first
14 starts, has won two in a row at Golden Gate Fields. She'll try for
another victory in today's eighth at the same track.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  The field in today's sixth at Gulfstream Park. The
dozen maiden claimers are a combined 0 for 66.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick four singling Cashmina in the fifth,
using Shabab, Confess, Flying Singer and Nikawa in the sixth,
Mysterious Cat and Take It Outside in the seventh and Wiley Grey,
Odeion, Call And Raise and Irish Terry in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 4/47. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $41.80/$319.60. Total money bet: $290.</TE>

<HD>Palffy, Visnovsky Get OK to Play in Preliminaries</HD>

<LD>The Kings will allow two of their top players to leave the team for
two days next month to play in an Olympic preliminary-round game,
General Manager Dave Taylor said Thursday, because they know how much
it means to the players.</LD>
<LD>   Ziggy Palffy and Lubomir Visnovsky will leave the Kings after a
game Feb. 8 at Phoenix, play for Slovakia against Latvia on Feb. 10
at Salt Lake City, then return for the Kings' next game, Feb. 11
against the Dallas Stars at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be a big thrill and a great opportunity to play and we'd
like to accommodate them," Taylor said. "We don't want to deny them
the experience."</LD>
<TE>   Slovakia is one of eight teams required to qualify for two spots
in the main competition leading to the medal round.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had said for months that they would not release Palffy
and Visnovsky to play in the qualifying round because it coincides
with NHL play and they couldn't afford to be without them.</TE>
<TE>   But after several discussions with the players and former NHL
player Peter Stastny, general manager of Team Slovakia, Taylor had a
change of heart.</TE>
<TE>   The Slovaks, who got a tournament-high 10 points from Palffy en
route to a sixth-place finish in the 1994 Winter Games at
Lillehammer, Norway, are scheduled to play Germany on Feb. 9, Latvia
on Feb. 10 and Austria on Feb. 12.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Eric Belanger, a key player in the Kings' recent surge, is
expected to be sidelined for at least a week and possibly much longer
after suffering a sprained left wrist in Tuesday night's 2-0 victory
over the Nashville Predators. Belanger has eight goals and 14
assists.</TE>

<HD>Kings Give Third Degree</HD>
<DH>Hockey: L.A., which is 13-3-3 since Dec. 8, scores three
goals in final period to defeat Buffalo, 4-2, before 16,698 at
Staples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The red-hot Kings, losers of only three of their previous 18 games,
found themselves up against a rusty goaltender Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   It did them little good for two periods, but in the third period
they broke loose for three goals against veteran Bob Essensa and
defeated the Buffalo Sabres, 4-2, in front of 16,698 at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Deadmarsh scored the winner as the surging Kings won their
third in a row, blowing past defenseman Richard Smehlik down the left
side before backhanding a shot between Essensa's legs with 1:16 to
play.</LD>
<TE>   Bryan Smolinski scored an insurance goal with 45 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Essensa, who turned 37 on Monday, hadn't started since Nov. 17,
when he lost to the Boston Bruins, 3-1, at Boston. Signed to a
one-year, $600,000 contract last summer, the veteran goalie has
played only sparingly behind No. 1 goaltender Martin Biron, in large
part because he hasn't played well.</TE>
<TE>   After helping to rally the Vancouver Canucks into the playoffs
last season by going 18-12-3 with a 2.68 goals-against average and
.892 save percentage, Essensa was 0-4 with a 3.28 GAA and an abysmal
.841 save percentage for the Sabres.</TE>
<TE>   Several of his teammates, however, expressed disappointment in
Coach Lindy Ruff, saying that he hadn't given Essensa much of a
chance.</TE>
<TE>   His start against the Kings was only his fourth of the season.</TE>
<TE>   And he appeared to be on his way to his first victory until early
in the third period, when a Sabre pass bounced crazily off a seam in
the glass behind the Sabre net, setting up perfectly for Ziggy Palffy
in the left faceoff circle.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy whistled a shot into the upper right corner of the net,
starting the rally that helped the Kings improve to 13-3-3 since Dec.
8.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings started the day in eighth place in the Western
Conference, having spent the last three months climbing out of the
hole they'd put themselves in thanks to a rash of early season
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Their surge into a playoff slot--they got there Tuesday night,
when they defeated the Nashville Predators, 2-0--had moved them
within six points of the division-leading San Jose Sharks in the
Pacific Division, sparking talk that the Kings should readjust their
sites and take aim at the division championship.</TE>
<TE>   Murray would have none of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I just coached a team that in December was six games below .500
and a long way from the playoffs," the coach said before the game,
"so let's keep our feet on the ground and take it one game at a time.
When that situation presents itself, then we'll deal with it. But
right now it's not even a thought."</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres, meanwhile, were last in the Northeast Division but
only three points out of a playoff spot in the East after winning
four of their last five.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what they've done is return to the type game that made
them so effective over the past number of years," Murray said of the
Sabres' recent surge. "They're playing real tight-checking and not
giving up a lot of space. They're playing very determined defensively
and they've had good goaltending.</TE>
<TE>   "They've returned to being tough to play against, much the same as
what our philosophy has been. They're a hard-working, physical team."</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres had given up only seven goals in their previous five
games and the Kings had shut out three of their previous six
opponents, but the teams combined for two goals in the first six
minutes, three in the first 10.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri Kalinin scored first, giving the Sabres a 1-0 lead only
4:19 into the game. After a pass from Miroslav Satan caromed off his
right skate, the Russian defenseman caught up to the puck and poked
it past goaltender Jamie Storr.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 90 seconds later, Brad Chartrand pulled the Kings even.
Chartrand, recalled from the minors after Eric Belanger suffered a
sprained left wrist in Tuesday's game, scored his third goal off a
pass from Mikko Eloranta.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres regained the lead at 9:36 when Curtis Brown scored on a
rebound. The initial shot by Taylor Pyatt was stopped by Storr, but
as the puck squirted back into the slot toward Lubomir Visnovsky, the
King defenseman fell down.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the slow-reacting Visnovsky had regained his footing,
Brown had circled the net, beaten him to the puck and punched it into
the net.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams clamped down in the second period, Essensa stopping a
point-blank shot by Nelson Emerson on a breakaway midway through the
period.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the period, a hit by Pyatt leveled King defenseman
Philippe Boucher, who suffered a concussion.</TE>

<LD>Phil Jackson, noted coach and philosopher, chose to wear a white
chef's shirt during Laker practice Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a tunic," he corrected everybody, before describing why he
had donned this one.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just about ingredients," he said. "Trying to find the right
ingredients."</LD>
<TE>   Losers of three of their last four, the Lakers have been stirred
and souffleed with and without Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' once-comfortable lead in the Pacific Division is now a
one-game deficit to Sacramento. Their next game is Saturday at San
Antonio, their third in a row without O'Neal, still serving a
suspension, but it's not all bad news on the horizon: At least the
Lakers won't be playing a last-place team.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have lost to four last-place teams since Dec. 21,
including a 102-96 loss at home Wednesday against Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, calmly answering questions in his culinary tunic, didn't
seem unsettled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the attrition of a season. It's what you go through," he
said. "We're not concerned at this period of time.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this team suffers from an inferiority complex or
from the fact they've fallen from grace. They'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the Lakers were merely outmuscled against Miami,
Alonzo Mourning making 12 of 17 shots for a season-high 28 points.</TE>
<TE>   "The physical beating that goes on in the course of that [Miami]
game, we needed a guy Shaq's size'" Jackson said. "We had nobody with
girth except Mark Madsen out there."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson doesn't expect a muscle tussle against the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not so sure outside of [Tim] Duncan that you're going to see
that they overwhelm you with their size," Jackson said. "[David]
Robinson can block. They're long and their extension is long, but
it's not the size and the muscularity that beats you in San Antonio
games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal left for Newark, N.J., on Thursday to attend the funeral of
his grandmother, Irma Harrison, who died Saturday. Harrison's funeral
will be this Saturday. O'Neal is expected to return Monday.</TE>

<DH>Chicago Will Be Watching McNabb Closely as He Returns Home
for Game Against His Former Favorite Team</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>There's a photo that has been passed around quite a bit in the
football coach's office at Mount Carmel High this week. It was taken
the last time Donovan McNabb played a big game at Soldier Field.</LD>
<LD>   The Mount Carmel Caravan had just defeated Bogan, 31-14, to win
the Prep Bowl that day in 1993. In the picture, six coaches are
standing on the Soldier Field sod. Four players are kneeling in front
of them, including McNabb on the right side. And the little
third-grader in front, the team's ball boy that year, is Frank Lenti
Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Lenti recalls another memory from that day. It's of McNabb, in the
midst of everyone else's pregame excitement, lying down on a
trainer's table with his helmet on his stomach.</LD>
<TE>   "Just getting a quick rest in," said Lenti, who is now a junior at
Mount Carmel. "I know he was excited about it, but he was relaxed."</TE>
<TE>   Some Chicago Bear fans are hoping that McNabb will be so fired up
about bringing the Philadelphia Eagles back to his hometown for
Saturday's divisional playoff game that the jitters will affect his
ability to play quarterback. The folks at Mount Carmel know better.</TE>
<TE>   "Don has a way about him, he's able to loosen up the troops," said
Frank Lenti Sr., the head football coach at Mount Carmel for the past
18 years. "He had an act that he used to go into that he'd have
everybody in practice cracking up. If we had a week where we had a
real big game, or I thought the kids were a little too tight, I'd
kind of turn him loose."</TE>
<TE>   McNabb might do impersonations. Or tell jokes. Or break dance. He
used to tease Frank Jr. by sending him out for deep patterns, then
holding onto the ball.</TE>
<TE>   It was no surprise to Lenti Sr. that the TV cameras caught McNabb
dancing his way through drills at Eagle practice this week.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Donovan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By now, Eagle Coach Andy Reid knows McNabb well enough to know
that the pressure of performing in front of family and friends won't
get to him.</TE>
<TE>   Like most great quarterbacks, "They kind of thrive on that stuff,"
Reid said. "Donovan is no different. He's going to enjoy coming back
home. I think it can be a positive experience for him--and a positive
pressure for him."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited," McNabb said. "I think my teammates are excited. I'm
not the only one from the Chicagoland area. There's about three or
four of us [including fullback Cecil Martin, who went to Evanston
Township High, and linebacker Barry Gardner, a Thornton graduate who
went to college at Northwestern]. We're excited about the opportunity
of going back home and seeing old family and friends and also
competing in the legendary Soldier Field."</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, McNabb had already heard the questions so often that
he had the responses ready.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I was a Bears' fan. And yes, I visualized playing with the
Bears," McNabb said.</TE>
<TE>   He rooted for the Bears against the Eagles in the teams' last
playoff meeting in what has become known as the Fog Bowl. He
remembered cheering when Sean Landeta--now his teammate with the
Eagles--whiffed on a punt for the New York Giants against the Bears
in another playoff game on their way to a Super Bowl XX victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I was excited about the Super Bowl, I was excited years after
that, even when they didn't make the playoffs. I just continued to
visualize putting that blue and orange jersey on and trying to lead
the team to a Super Bowl one day."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears didn't get a high enough draft pick to land McNabb, who
went to Philadelphia with the second pick 1999. (The Bears got stuck
with Cade McNown). Eagle fans booed McNabb on draft day. Now they
celebrate him as much if not more than reigning NBA MVP Allen Iverson
of the Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb has been winning converts and proving people wrong since he
left Mount Carmel, a school of 800 boys on the South Side that has
won eight state football championships under Lenti. While with the
Caravan, as part of a stellar athletic career that also put him on
the basketball court with future Boston Celtic Antoine Walker, McNabb
ran an offense that relied on the run 70% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming out of high school, some of the quote-unquote talent
scouts, the prognosticators, they said he's not a good enough passer
to be a Division I quarterback," Lenti Sr. said. "I'd said all along
he was more than adequate, he was very good. We just didn't need him
to do those things all the time."</TE>
<TE>   By the time McNabb left for Syracuse, some coaches were predicting
that he would win a Heisman Trophy. He finished fifth in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Even when McNabb was booed on draft day, Lenti didn't worry about
his prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew eventually he'd win the people over because he's that kind
of person," Lenti said. "He's got that kind of personality, that kind
of great character."</TE>
<TE>   He has developed into a good enough passer to throw for 3,233
yards and 25 touchdowns this season. But it's his running ability
that makes him so dangerous and has Bear fans worried that their
dream season could come to an end Saturday. There's been talk all
week that the Bears will need to dedicate one defender to "spying" on
McNabb, so much so that Bear defensive coordinator Greg Blache joked:
"I'm going to put a guy from the CIA on him."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Bears wouldn't mind an all-out blitz from McNabb's
old buddies to distract him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll just shut all my phones down and cut off my pagers
once I get down there," McNabb said. "You know what your job is. You
know what you have to do. You're there for a reason and that's to
play football, and not to come back and see family and friends and
hang out and things of that nature. My job's to come back home and
stay focused and try to lead the team to hopefully another win."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean McNabb will forget about his people. Never.</TE>
<TE>   You can tell by the signed picture of him hanging in a Mount
Carmel office.</TE>
<TE>   "To Coach Lenti:</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for all the support that you have given me over my
athletic career at Mt. Carmel. I will always be a Caravan."</TE>

<LD>The Daytona 500 will open the Winston Cup season in less than a month
and Tony Stewart has been tabbed as the driver to beat by four-time
champion Jeff Gordon, but Stewart has left little doubt that he would
rather be racing midgets on Saturday nights than the high-profile
NASCAR stock cars on Sundays.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart took time off from testing Joe Gibbs' Home Depot Pontiac
last weekend to win the Chili Bowl midget race in Tulsa, Okla., an
event that annually draws every open-wheel, short-track driver of
note in the country. It was the latest addition to Stewart's
collection of prestigious midget wins, which includes the 2000 Turkey
Night Grand Prix at Irwindale Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   After the Chili Bowl win, the former triple U.S. Auto Club
champion explained why he kept chasing his dream.</LD>
<TE>   "This style of racing is fun because you come here and unload your
car and you race," he said. "You go out, have dinner together and
drag down the road to the next place and do it again all over next
week.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no politics. You didn't once hear anybody [at Tulsa]
complaining that somebody's body style had more down force and less
drag than anybody else. That's why it's fun. You don't hear anybody
complain about anything, you just go race."</TE>
<TE>   Cory Kruseman, Sprint Car Racing Assn. champion from Ventura and
2000 Chili Bowl winner, finished third, behind Kevin Doty. Danny
Lasoski, World of Outlaws champion, was seventh, J. J. Yeley 11th,
Jason Leffler 14th, Richard Griffin 15th and Troy Rutherford 19th in
the 24-car main event. Wally Pankratz, USAC western regional champion
in 2000, missed the main by one spot, finishing seventh in his
semifinal heat with only six qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's back to Daytona for Stewart and more practice, something
he sees as rather unimportant and uninteresting.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always thought [Daytona testing] was a waste of time, unless
you were a lower team looking for a sponsor and some fast laps during
testing would help you out. For a driver, you go out there and you
shift three times. Once you leave pit lane, you just go wide open and
you leave it there. You get an out lap and two timed laps and then
you bring it in the garage. That's all we do for three days. You're
just a passenger out there. The real work is being done by the
engineers back in the garage.</TE>
<TE>   "NASCAR has proven time and again that they're willing to change
the rules at any time for any or no reason. So what we're running
right now may not be what we come back here with [for the 500 on Feb.
17]. I don't get too excited about rules anymore because they change
them at any time"</TE>
<TE>   Anybody know where there's a good midget race for Stewart?</TE>
<TE>   Farewell to Buster</TE>
<TE>   For more than 30 years, Buster Couch was the most recognizable
person in drag racing.</TE>
<TE>   That's because Buster was the man in the middle, the guy who
flipped the switch that sent 6,000-horsepower top fuel and funny cars
down the quarter-mile racing strip at National Hot Rod Assn. events
from Pomona to Englishtown, N.J..</TE>
<TE>   He retired from the starting line after the 1995 season, turning
the duties over to Rick Stewart, and took a more comfortable position
in the staging tower, serving as a control monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday, the 6-foot-3, 250-plus pound Couch was preparing
for the start of another NHRA season when his heart gave out. At 66,
he died at his home, near Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me what it's like to take Buster's place, and I have
to correct them," Stewart said from his home in Dallas. "Nobody takes
Buster's place. I'm just carrying on for him. I know that every time
I flip that switch, he's watching, and if I mess up he'll pick me up
and throw me over the guard rail."</TE>
<TE>   Couch was a Golden Gloves boxer in his youth and always sort of
regretted that drag racing became respectable.</TE>
<TE>   "Fighting was as much a part of racing as going fast back in the
'60s and '70s," he said a few years ago. "Guys used to get mad at
everything and the way to settle arguments was usually to start a
fight. I kind of miss it."</TE>
<TE>   NHRA officials estimated that Couch started more than half a
million side-by-side races. In his early days, he waved a flag, but
Couch was instrumental in development of the Christmas-tree starting
device used today.</TE>
<TE>   "Few in the last 50 years epitomized the spirit of NHRA through
not only his words, but his actions, the way Buster did," said Tom
Compton, NHRA president.</TE>
<TE>   Added Graham Light, NHRA vice president, "Through all the major
contributions Buster made to the NHRA, and in the past few years he
was a big assistance in race control with his vast knowledge of the
sport, I think his greatest gift may have been his humor. Buster had
a unique knack to make people laugh, but still maintain respect."</TE>
<TE>   What's With Jeremy?</TE>
<TE>   In nine years of supercross, during which he won seven
championships, Jeremy McGrath never finished outside the top 10 more
than once a season.</TE>
<TE>   This year, in two races, he ran 13th at Anaheim and 10th at San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "I made some adjustments after Anaheim, but it seems my timing is
still off," he said. "I am working hard this week to correct those
issues and really look forward to being back in Anaheim again
Saturday night."</TE>
<TE>   Edison Field has been good to the 30-year-old from Encinitas. Of
the 13 250cc races he has entered there, he has won eight. He also
has won two 125cc events at Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Brooks, his longtime team manager, insists that it is not
lack of conditioning slowing McGrath.</TE>
<TE>   "MC is in the best shape he has ever been in and once his timing
kicks in and his mind and body start working together, all the pieces
will fall right back into place. We are suffering just a minor
hiccup."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, French rider David Vuillemin has scored
consecutive victories on his factory Yamaha and leads veteran Honda
rider Mike LaRocco, 50-42, going into Round 3 Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Fast Laps</TE>
<TE>   Australian driver Andrew Cowan, 22, will replace Mike Dunn in the
New York Yankees' top-fuel dragster for Gwynn/Steinbrenner Racing
this season. Dunn, 45, who won 22 NHRA national events, will join the
NHRA broadcast team on ESPN.... Irwindale Speedway will host a custom
car and motorcycle show and street-legal drag racing Saturday,
starting at 2 p.m. It is a program postponed from Nov. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Hamill and Greg Hancock, world Grand Prix speedway
motorcycle champions from Southern California, will no longer be
teammates in the British Speedway League. Because of a new rule
limiting elite teams to two Grand Prix riders, Coventry team
president Colin Pratt had to choose between the close friends, and he
took Hamill to ride with Andreas Jonsson. Also on the Coventry team,
but not GPs, are Billy Janniro and Ryan Fisher. The decision leaves
Hancock without a British League ride.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Fleming, 17, of North Hills, and Charlie Kimball, 16, of
Camarillo, have been selected for Barber-CART karting scholarships
and a full season of racing in the Skip Barber Formula Dodge
series.... Racing brothers Ed and Tim Herbst of Las Vegas have drawn
the first starting position for the eighth annual SCORE Laughlin
Desert Challenge. The brothers, already the winningest drivers in the
event's history, will be in the Terrible Herbst Motorsport Ford
F-150. The race is Jan. 26-27.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Pawl, 84, one of the last of the Indianapolis 500 riding
mechanics, died last Thursday of pancreatic cancer. Pawl, of Crown
Point, Ind., also built and raced midget cars from 1930 through 1950.
His drivers included Indy 500 winner Johnnie Parsons, Ted Duncan and
Paul Russo.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago Bulls have one less thing to worry about: They won't be
winless on the road this season.</LD>
<LD>   The Bulls finally won a game outside the United Center, ending an
0-18 skid with a 94-91 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't lose every game we play on the road," said Ron Artest,
suddenly full of confidence.</LD>
<TE>   Ron Mercer, who scored 19 points, made the go-ahead basket with
37.3 seconds left and two free throws for the Bulls. Chicago had been
the only NBA team without a road victory. Every other team had at
least two.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good, really good," Mercer said. "I hope this will give
us a lot more confidence. We're capable of beating any team, at home
or on the road."</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls won for only the second time in nine games, but the
other victory came against the Lakers. Brad Miller played his first
game since being suspended for an altercation with Shaquille O'Neal
and had 12 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 102, Utah 98--Tim Duncan scored 35 points and went 17
for 17 from the free-throw line to lead the Spurs at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's offensive rebound after Antonio Daniels' missed free
throw, and his two foul shots with 15 seconds left put the Spurs
ahead by four points.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 93, Charlotte 88--Allen Iverson, coming off a
career-high 58-point performance, scored 33 and made two free throws
with 11 seconds left to seal the 76er victory at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Nailon tied his career-high with 27 points for the Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 108, Memphis 97--Dirk Nowitzki scored 32 points and Steve
Nash had 20 points and 10 assists as four of Dallas' starters
finished in double figures at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 92, Portland 90--Eddie Jones scored 25 points, including a
desperation three-pointer that banked in late in the fourth quarter
to force overtime, as the Heat won at Portland, Ore.</TE>

<HD>Cuban Warns Feud Could Make Him Sell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outspoken Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban said on Thursday that he
would sell the team if NBA Commissioner David Stern ever punished him
by forcing the franchise to forfeit draft picks.</LD>
<LD>   "Because at that point it's personal, and I can't run a business
in that kind of world," Cuban said.</LD>
<LD>   Cuban has been fined eight times totaling more than $1 million in
his first two years as owner.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, deemed as
"pure speculation" reports of a possible suspension of Cuban or the
forfeiture of draft picks. However, Lewis Katz, owner of the New
Jersey Nets, implied Cuban will be suspended for his next violation,
saying "he's right on that line of not being able to go to games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Charlotte Hornets filed an application with the NBA to move to
New Orleans, and Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster said he was certain
league owners will approve the move.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole deal is complete," Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   The relocation must be approved by a majority of the 29 NBA
owners. Granik said he hopes for a vote by late April. The team would
play in the two-year-old New Orleans Arena.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Are the Champions in Value Too</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In these days of stock market turbulence and poor-performing
portfolios, Laker owner Jerry Buss had to be happy with a piece of
economic news Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers were rated the most valuable NBA franchise, worth $403
million, according to Forbes magazine.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers' value increased 12% in one year, moving them ahead of
the New York Knicks ($392 million) primarily because of additional
revenue from eight home playoff games while winning the NBA title.</LD>
<TE>   Buss purchased the Lakers, Kings, the Forum and a ranch in Kern
County for $67.5 million in 1979. The Lakers at the time were valued
at about $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   With the buy-low, sell-high principle in mind, a couple Lakers
offered financial advice to Buss.</TE>
<TE>   "It'd be hard to let go of a franchise with so much history, but
there's always that business side of it," Samaki Walker said. "I
think if it's me, it'd be sold."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry was more bullish.</TE>
<TE>   "Not now because we're winning," he said. "Win one more
championship and then he can get out for about $600 million."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were 24th among 29 NBA teams with a value of $170
million.</TE>
<TE>   The value marked an increase of 10% from a year ago, but the
Clippers were called "third-class tenants in Staples Center" by
Forbes.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had the lowest player expenses in the NBA, only $32.6
million, and were more than doubled by the Lakers in annual revenue
despite sharing the same arena. The Lakers had revenues of $144
million while the Clippers had $68 million for the 2000-01 season.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine said five teams lost value from a year ago. New
Jersey ($169 million) and Charlotte ($135 million) each dropped 6%
from last year, while New York (down 1% to $392 million), Detroit
(down 2% to $230 million) and Golden State (down 1% to $166 million)
also lost value, Forbes said.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis, which moved from Vancouver, had the largest gain in value
to $160 million, an increase of 36% from a year ago..</TE>

<HD>Yagudin Wins European Title</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexei Yagudin of Russia reclaimed the European figure skating title
Thursday night at Lausanne, Switzerland, but it was an imperfect
victory with silver medalist and countryman Alexander Abt beating him
on the jumps.</LD>
<LD>   Yagudin fought through his final free program, touching down on
his opening quad, then coming right back to hit a clean quad toe loop
at the other end of the rink.</LD>
<LD>   He completed one quad and six triples, including two triple
axel-triple combinations, but he finished the program with two double
loops and failed to deliver a planned quad-triple-triple
combination--a jump he hopes to have polished for the Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   "The double loops made my program dirty, but in my opinion, I had
the stronger free skating," Yagudin said. "I didn't fall, I didn't
look bad, I just stepped out of the first quad. I know that is not
going to be enough to be Olympic champion, but today it was enough to
win."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin clapped sullenly from rinkside as Abt wrapped up his
program: a quad and eight triples, including a quad-double
combination on his opening move.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Abt's technically superior program, Yagudin won the 6-3
decision on his highly stylized presentation, the deciding factor in
the free program and the moves that give context to the jumps and
distinguish champions.</TE>
<TE>   In a startling ascent to the top of European figure skating,
France's Brian Joubert, 17, won the bronze at his first European
championships. He finished third at the French nationals this year
and was 14th in last year's nationals.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France moved into
the lead of the ice dance event with an uncharacteristically
restrained Flamenco/Tango routine for the original dance that earned
one 6.0 for presentation.</TE>
<TE>   The championships continue with the women's short program today.</TE>

<LD>Brett Favre wants this known: He never made Kurt Warner carry his
helmet.</LD>
<LD>   "I think people try to go a little bit overboard with that one,"
Favre said this week.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe so, but the fact remains, the St. Louis star was a nobody at
Green Bay training camp in 1994, a fourth-string quarterback who'd
signed a two-year deal as a free agent for a $5,000 bonus. He was
there for only one camp, didn't take many snaps in practice and never
played in an exhibition game, buried on the depth chart beneath
Favre, Ty Detmer and Mark Brunell.</LD>
<TE>   Warner, who won his second most-valuable-player award this season,
will be reunited with three-time MVP Favre on Sunday when the Rams
play host to the Packers in a divisional playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "We called him Pop Warner," Favre said. "I think Mooch
[then-quarterback coach Steve Mariucci] kind of coined the phrase,
and as we called Mooch 'Mooch,' we called Kurt 'Pop'--and I've been
called things myself. It was all in fun.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I remember, Kurt was quiet, as I was when I went to
Atlanta [as a rookie]."</TE>
<TE>   Warner didn't speak much this week, either. He was silenced by
bruised vocal cords but was able to call signals at practice
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   And Warner isn't the only playoff quarterback who will be reunited
with his former team this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Gannon, whose Oakland Raiders will play Saturday at New
England, was a fourth-round pick of the Patriots in 1987.</TE>

<HD>Parcells Still Up in the Air</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Parcells is still contemplating whether he wants to return to
coaching in the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now, I'm trying to kind of weigh all the issues involved
with making a commitment that I know is necessary to go back to
coaching in the NFL," Parcells said on his weekly radio show.</LD>
<LD>   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are negotiating with the two-time Super
Bowl winner to replace Tony Dungy. The former Giant, Patriot and Jet
coach said on Sporting News Radio that reports of a done deal are not
true.</LD>
<TE>   "As of this moment, I haven't decided that that's what I'm going
to do because it does involve a strong commitment, and it does
involve a lot of work, and you are responsible to the organization
you work for, and you have to do it 100%," Parcells said. "And until
I feel that I can do that, I'm just gonna deliberate and decide one
way or another. If I choose not to coach again, then I feel certain
that I'll be retired from football for good."</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers fired Dungy on Monday night, then formally began
talks with Parcells the following day. The team also has interviewed
Mike Tannenbaum, a Parcells' protege, for the general manager's job
held by Rich McKay.</TE>
<TE>   McKay said he has been offered a position as team president, but
is not sure if he will accept it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Washington Redskin Coach Steve Spurrier hired nine former
University of Florida assistants and announced that two coaches--Hue
Jackson and Mike Stock--will remain from fired coach Marty
Schottenheimer's staff.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Spurrier Jr., a former assistant under his father at Florida
and most recently a member of the University of Oklahoma staff, will
coach the wide receivers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Moeller stepped down as defensive coordinator of the
Jacksonville Jaguars after a season in which his defense surrendered
the late decisive score in six of 10 losses.</TE>
<TE>   Moeller came under criticism from Coach Tom Coughlin, and from his
own players, who disagreed with the so-called "soft" defenses he
called.</TE>
<TE>   A team news release said Coughlin and Moeller reached the decision
by mutual agreement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ram running back Marshall Faulk won The Associated Press NFL
Offensive Player award for the third consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk did it with a typically spectacular season, rushing for
1,382 yards, gaining 765 yards receiving on 83 catches--best among
NFL running backs--scoring 21 touchdowns and going over 2,000 yards
from scrimmage (2,147) for the fourth consecutive season, an NFL
record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Jim Kelly, team owner Art Modell and Parcells are
among 15 finalists announced for induction into the Pro Football Hall
of Fame. Other finalists include coach George Allen, tight end Dave
Casper, punter Ray Guy, defensive back Lester Hayes and wide receiver
James Lofton.</TE>
<TE>   Finalists will be announced Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joey Getherall, a former Notre Dame receiver and return specialist
from La Puente Bishop Amat High, signed a two-year deal with the
Miami Dolphins. He had the nation's ninth-best average in punt
returns (16.3 yards) in 2000. He spent training camp with Pittsburgh
as an undrafted free agent, was waived and worked as a substitute
teacher last fall.</TE>

<HD>Bruins Have More Punch Than Senators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a tough Eastern Conference battle between the Boston Bruins and
Ottawa Senators, it was a fight to the finish.</LD>
<LD>   Five different players scored for Boston and Bill Guerin added two
assists to lift the Bruins to a 5-2 victory over the Senators on
Thursday at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins avoided their second three-game losing streak of the
season and beat Ottawa for only the third time in the last 13 games.</LD>
<TE>   After Hal Gill gave the Bruins a 5-1 lead in the third period,
Ottawa's frustration boiled over as simultaneous fights broke out in
the Senators' end, including one between goaltenders Patrick Lalime
and Byron Dafoe. Seven players were ejected and there were 150
penalty minutes in the third.</TE>
<TE>   "I was glad that I was kicked out because I was pretty tired and
don't know if I could've played the last six minutes," the Bruins'
Dafoe said. "We play them again in a week and there might be some bad
blood."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Calgary 4--Mario Lemieux assisted on all three of
Aleksey Morozov's goals and added an empty-net goal as the Penguins
survived a late scare to win at Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, playing his third game after missing 24 because of a hip
injury, has scored in the Penguins' last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Atlanta 3--John LeClair scored the go-ahead goal
2:02 into the third period, and the host Flyers won their seventh
straight.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 1, Carolina 1--Jeff Hackett stopped 29 shots, including
two tough chances in overtime, as the Canadiens tied the Hurricanes
at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 6, New York Rangers 4--Sergei Brylin had two goals and
an assist and the Devils matched their biggest offensive effort of
the season in a win at East Rutherford, N.J. The Rangers are winless
in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Toronto 2--Greg Johnson scored 47 seconds into
overtime as the Predators won at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Vancouver 4--Keith Tkachuk scored twice and Scott
Mellanby and Al MacInnis each had a goal and two assists as the host
Blues won their seventh straight.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, Phoenix 2--Ville Nieminen scored on a breakaway with
two seconds left in overtime, lifting the Avalanche at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 3, New York Islanders 2--Evgeni Nabokov stopped 31 shots
for his third consecutive victory, and the Sharks scored two
power-play goals in a win at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ricci and Mike Rathje scored on the power play, while Marco
Sturm extended his points streak to four games with a goal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Sergei Fedorov should quit the Detroit Red Wings after
they "disrespected" the all-star center by asking him to play
defense, his father told the Sport Express newspaper, a Russian
publication. "This summer, when Sergei becomes an unrestricted free
agent, I urge him to change the club," said Viktor Fedorov. "Sergei
has already proved everything to everyone in his past 11 seasons in
Detroit." Fedorov is in the final year of a six-year, $38 million
contract....The Chicago Blackhawks acquired defenseman Joe Reekie
from the Washington Capitals for a fourth-round draft pick in this
year's entry draft....Russian goalie Evgeni Nabokov will put his case
to be allowed to play at the Winter Olympics to the top international
sports court next week, the International Ice Hockey Federation said.
The federation has ruled that Nabokov, who plays for San Jose, is
ineligible to compete for Russia because he played for the Kazakstan
national team in the 1994 IIHF World Championship.</TE>

<HD>More Out-of-Competition Drug Tests Conducted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sign of the increasing vitality of the agency charged with
freeing sport from the taint of illicit drug use, the World
Anti-Doping Agency will announce today that it will have conducted
3,500 out-of-competition drug tests in the 12 months before the start
of the Salt Lake Winter Olympics, including 1,200 from December
through the Feb. 8 start of the Games.</LD>
<LD>   Of 2,600 tests conducted through Jan. 10, 24, or about 1%,
returned positive or "elevated" results, and some athletes with
elevated numbers may have been previously authorized to take certain
medicines, the WADA report will say.</LD>
<LD>   It would be foolhardy, however, for anyone interested in Olympic
sports to pretend that these numbers show that WADA, created two
years ago in the wake of the doping scandal at the 1998 Tour de
France cycling event, already is catching all but a few cheaters.</LD>
<TE>   For at least the last 35 years, athletes, coaches and trainers
have been aggressively pushing the boundaries of scientific and
medical research in an effort to stay one step ahead of the
International Olympic Committee and other authorities. The current
performance-enhancing substances of choice include human growth
hormone and EPO, a synthetic hormone that boosts red blood cell
production and thus enables athletes to train harder and longer.</TE>
<TE>   Already, however, WADA has conducted more EPO tests in advance of
the Salt Lake Games than the 200 or so it did in the run-up to the
Sydney Summer Games in 2000, according to WADA Chairman Dick Pound,
an IOC member from Canada. None of the 200-plus tests has returned
yet a positive result.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the report, due to be issued today in Montreal, WADA's
new headquarters, plainly shows that WADA has--perhaps for the first
time--focused the attention of sports and government officials
worldwide on athletes' use of banned substances.</TE>
<TE>   "WADA has come a sight farther than anyone thought possible and
there is growing enthusiasm in the sport community and the public at
large for the Olympics to be a humanistic, as opposed to chemical,
triumph," Pound said in a telephone interview Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge is so formidable that even IOC President Jacques
Rogge recently expressed doubt that the doping war can be won. A
significant issue in the coming months--though largely legalistic and
decidedly unglamorous--is to effect a uniform anti-doping code
worldwide; Pound said the goal is to have it in place by the Athens
2004 Summer Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be won, oddly enough," Pound said.</TE>
<TE>   Other signs of WADA's viability include agreements with 34 of the
35 international sports federations on the Olympic program. The
holdout is FIFA, soccer's worldwide governing body; Pound said an
agreement in principle has been reached but not yet signed.</TE>
<TE>   WADA's budget, $6 million in its first year, will reach $18.2
million this year. Tests were conducted last year in 46 countries, on
athletes from 75 nations.</TE>
<TE>   The report is being issued in conjunction with WADA's avowed
intent to make the Salt Lake Games "the most drug-free in Olympic
history" and a slogan: "At the Olympics, we want heroes, not just
winners."</TE>
<TE>   Pound said: "That does encapsulate a lot of what I personally
feel. You're dealing with a humanistic activity and it shouldn't be
who can ingest the most chemicals that determines the outcome. You
want it to be fair. You want it to be healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Months ago, Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney
said he wanted 100% of the 2,400 athletes expected at the Winter
Olympics to have been subjected to an out-of-competition test before
the Games begin--by WADA, an international sports federation or other
authority. While some critics have said that 100% is grossly
optimistic in part because of the large pool of Olympic hopefuls,
Romney said this week he believes it is still possible.</TE>
<TE>   Out-of-competition tests are a key to eliminating athlete drug use
because they are no-notice tests.</TE>
<TE>   But they also are problematic. The reality, as WADA testers have
discovered, is that sometimes an athlete isn't where the testers
expect him or her to be--and, for any number of reasons, some
legitimate, some suspicious, the athlete simply can't be found.</TE>

<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For four years he sold real estate. His goal was to join the
corporate world; he aspired to become a stock broker.</LD>
<LD>   But somewhere along the line, while studying to obtain a license
to sell securities, Ascanio Pignatelli realized that he had stumbled
onto the wrong path.</LD>
<LD>   "I woke up and realized that that's not what life's all about," he
said. "Life is about exploring and adventure. Life is an amazing
thing. I want to do it all and see it all. I want to go everywhere
and I want to try everything."</LD>
<TE>   With this new outlook, Pignatelli traded his business suit for a
wetsuit, and with a few kicks of his swim fins he left the corporate
world behind.</TE>
<TE>   Now a certified dive master, he isn't sure where this watery path
will ultimately lead. But he likes where he has gone so far. Most
recently, that has been deep into the realm of the shark, as co-host
of a Travel Channel series called "Shark Chasers."</TE>
<TE>   The four-episode series, a Burrud production conceived by
Pignatelli and also starring actor JD Roberto, is scheduled to air
during the summer and should be a treat for anyone who appreciates
this remarkable animal.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other shark specials, "Shark Chasers" puts fun ahead of
science, relying on the wit of the two hosts while still giving
viewers a clear understanding of how these predators behave.</TE>
<TE>   Its hosts are not experts but rather personable and articulate
young men "doing something the average diver can actually do," said
Pignatelli, 31, of Santa Monica. "It's just two guys on an adventure
getting up close and personal with sharks."</TE>
<TE>   That's somewhat of an overstatement. The average diver might have
trouble affording trips to the Bahamas, South Africa, Cocos Island
(off Costa Rica) and French Polynesia--where the four episodes were
filmed. Once at any of these locations, the average diver might not
be so inclined or even allowed to hand feed a 10-foot lemon shark, or
to grab a much larger great white by the snout and lift its head out
of the water, which the hosts were able to do.</TE>
<TE>   But the average diver can visit these destinations--and get up
close and personal with sharks.</TE>
<TE>   During a lunch last Friday in Marina del Rey, Pignatelli discussed
his travels while offering, for review, a rough cut of the Bahamas
show.</TE>
<TE>   In that episode, the hosts are treated to a tour of the colorful
reefs and ghostly wrecks off Nassau as guests of Stuart Cove's Dive
Bahamas. The Coves are renowned for their shark dives and visit areas
that are teeming with Caribbean reef sharks.</TE>
<TE>   To ease qualms the average diver might have about swimming with so
many large sharks, Pignatelli and Roberto take a group of a
school-age children snorkeling in an area where the rulers of the
reef are clearly visible from the deck of the boat. One by one,
Pignatelli coaxes the children into the water.</TE>
<TE>   "And almost all of them made it back in one piece," he later
joked.</TE>
<TE>   Gathering their scuba gear and communication equipment, the hosts
then embark on a dive scooter-powered adventure though gin-clear
lagoons, talking to one another about encounters with creatures large
and small.</TE>
<TE>   A highlight of the 52-minute episode includes a shark-feeding
operation involving a large crate of fish parts set on the bottom,
dozens of circling sharks and spears that are used to safely deliver
the fish to the sharks.</TE>
<TE>   The sharks, most measuring five to eight feet, can be seen
swimming through the divers' legs, between their outstretched arms,
showing interest only in the fish being taken from the crate, and in
the crate itself.</TE>
<TE>   After the feed, Pignatelli is able to fulfill one of his dreams:
to lure a large shark into his arms and immobilize it by gently
rubbing his metal-meshed glove along the top of its head.</TE>
<TE>   The metal in the gloves, it is explained, interferes with a
shark's highly developed sensory system and renders the animal
motionless until the rubbing is stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems really hard and all that but actually it's quite simple
and it's incredible fun," Pignatelli said. "I had dreams about that
dive. I swear to God I had dreams that night."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The filming of "Shark Chasers" began last May in South Africa and
concluded last month in French Polynesia.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa didn't feature a lot of sharks, but those that were
encountered were great whites, including one seen from above water
that caused the jaw of even the seasoned guide to drop because of its
incredible size and girth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a 20-footer and that's as big as they get," Pignatelli
said.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be seen on the TV show because everyone "was too blown
away" by its size to get their cameras out, Pignatelli said. "The two
things I remember most distinctly are that he had absolutely no
scars, unlike all the other sharks we saw, and his girth was just
enormous. He was probably six feet wide."</TE>
<TE>   In South Africa, as in Australia, scuba divers observe great
whites from within the safety of a submerged cage.</TE>
<TE>   Pignatelli had hoped to swim freely among the sharks "because I
didn't want them to be falsely portrayed as aggressive man-eating
animals, because that's simply not true." However, the production
company insisted that a cage be used.</TE>
<TE>   What will make the show is considerable footage shot from within
the cage, showing how cautious these apex predators really are while
inspecting potential food items.</TE>
<TE>   What may or may not make the cut is a segment showing Roberto
lifting the head of a large great white out of the water with his
hand.</TE>
<TE>   "[The guides] don't let anyone do this," Pignatelli said. "We were
allowed only because of the big bucks, the exposure they were
receiving, and partially due to the fact they thought that shark
chasers were shark experts."</TE>
<TE>   The real experts are well-versed in the precarious art of
shark-lifting. The predators are baited to the boat and grabbed by
the snout, and because the snout is so sensitive the shark is careful
not to move so its head can be lifted partially out of the water.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds so gnarly but it's not," Pignatelli said. "Because when
you grab sharks by the nose they become entranced."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At Cocos Island, a pristine wonderland 300 miles off Costa Rica's
west coast, "I had my best day of diving ever," Pignatelli said. "It
was our first encounter with countless hammerheads ... just nonstop
hammerheads and white-tips everywhere. You'd probably see 200
white-tips on every dive. I mean, it starts to get boring after a
while: You're almost pushing them out of the way because you want to
see other stuff."</TE>
<TE>   At French Polynesia, the divers visited three islands--Tahiti,
Moorea and Rangiroa--and encountered eight species of sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Pignatelli fed sharks with a spear at the Bahamas, he was
able to do it by hand in French Polynesia.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys here are a lot more wild-west," he says. "The guys at
Stuart Cove's did not take a chance of anyone getting hurt, but in
French Polynesia there are no rules."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, there was one piece of advice: Let go of the chunk of
fish after the shark grabs hold of it, lest you risk having your arm
pulled from its socket.</TE>
<TE>   Pignatelli's subject was a 10- to 12-foot lemon shark. Lying still
on the bottom, in the middle of a cloud of small reef fish trying to
get at the bait, he could not see any of the large sharks circling
the cloud.</TE>
<TE>   All of a sudden, the little fish vanished, and the bigger of the
sharks was at the end of Pignatelli's outstretched arm, biting down
on the hunk of fish without taking so much as a finger.</TE>
<TE>   "They said that when a shark grabs, you let go because you cannot
win the tug-of-war," Pignatelli said. "Well, I had spent six dives
and three hours of bottom time trying to feed this one shark--there's
no way I'm going to give up this piece of fish.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, he grabbed it and twisted with all his muscle and almost
ripped my arm off. He ripped the fish away but then he also dropped
it, so I immediately grabbed it and everyone laughed. It was my
little victory."</TE>

<HD>Expos Might Be a Capital Gain</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Commissioner Bud Selig all but dangled the Montreal Expos in front of
the baseball-starved populace of Washington D.C. on Thursday, saying
that "relocation is coming in the near future" and that the nation's
capital is "the prime candidate" to land a team that moves.</LD>
<LD>   Selig said no team would move this year, virtually assuring the
Expos of playing a farewell season in Montreal under the control of
major league owners.</LD>
<LD>   The designated hitter did not exist when the Washington Senators
moved to Texas in 1971, and no major league team has moved since
then. Baseball's owners have long prided themselves on franchise
stability, but they now insist the economic conditions of the sport
are so grave they can only be remedied by removing teams from markets
that fail to generate sufficient revenue.</LD>
<TE>   "The commissioner has appeared more receptive to relocation than
he has ever been," said Bob DuPuy, baseball's executive vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   Owners Wednesday approved the sale of the Boston Red Sox to a
group led by Florida Marlin owner John Henry, expected to be followed
within two weeks by the sale of the Marlins to Montreal owner Jeffrey
Loria. With the owners' plan to eliminate two teams all but dead for
this year and no buyers interested in the Expos, that would leave
Selig's office to operate the team in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be shocked if it went on more than one year," DuPuy said.</TE>
<TE>   The operational details of a league-controlled franchise remain
unresolved. The Loria sale was not placed on the agenda Wednesday,
one executive said, in part because owners have not yet been told how
much it will cost to run the Expos in addition to the $120 million
proposed to buy back the franchise from Loria.</TE>
<TE>   DuPuy said Selig would appoint an "independent operator" to run
the team on "a budget within the parameters of where the Expos'
budget was." The players' union wants to discuss how, and how
competitively, the team would be run, union chief Donald Fehr said.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos might attract little interest in Montreal during a
lame-duck season, but their presence would remind other low-revenue
markets that their franchises remain endangered, particularly in the
absence of new ballparks.</TE>
<TE>   Owners could revive their plan to eliminate teams next fall,
pairing the Expos with the Oakland Athletics, Tampa Bay Devil Rays or
Minnesota Twins and moving the Marlins to Washington if Loria fails
to secure a new stadium in Florida. Owners also could turn a profit
on their one-year operation of the Expos by selling them to a D.C.
group, for perhaps double or triple the price paid to buy out Loria.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion of potential franchise moves overshadowed Fehr's
appearance at the owners' meetings. In what Fehr called a "rather
radical departure from the past," Selig invited Fehr to make an
unprecedented visit to address owners.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr, leading a six-man delegation that included players Rich
Aurilia, Tony Clark and Mark Loretta, spoke about union positions on
such issues as competitive imbalance and revenue disparities.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't about negotiating," Atlanta Brave President Stan
Kasten said. "This was about simply talking to each other."</TE>
<TE>   While Selig repeated his promise not to lock players out of spring
training, and while Fehr termed a strike "a last resort" that has not
been considered, neither side minimized the difficulties inherent in
negotiating a collective bargaining agreement to replace the one that
expired in November. Talks are scheduled to resume next week.</TE>

<LD>It took the longest time for Katy O'Brien to score Thursday, but when
she did, her points packed plenty of punch.</LD>
<LD>   O'Brien was shut out for the first 30 minutes, then delivered the
game's final three points in the last 90 seconds to give Ventura a
44-41 victory over visiting Santa Barbara in a key Channel League
game.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura, ranked No. 8 by The Times, seized control of the league
race by improving to 17-2 overall, 4-0 in league. Santa Barbara,
ranked 12th, dropped to 17-3, 3-2. The Dons had beaten Ventura
earlier this season in the Buena tournament, 61-58, in overtime.</LD>
<TE>   There was a chance this game was headed to overtime, too. Tied at
41-41, freshman Caitlin O'Neill rifled a pass through the defense to
O'Brien, who put away a left-handed layup for a 43-41 lead. She added
a free throw with 11 seconds left, making it the biggest three-point
night of O'Brien's life.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't by choice," said O'Brien, who is averaging 13 points
but missed her first seven field-goal attempts--six of them from the
three-point arc. "Some days, you have to adapt. Caitlin made a great
pass. They were so worried about the three-point basket, they left
the weakside block open. Luckily, I can make a layup."</TE>
<TE>   Jenni Dooley led Ventura with 20 points, making four of her team's
five three-point baskets. Holding a 25-19 lead at halftime, Ventura
scored only two points in the third quarter and trailed, 32-27, less
than a minute into the fourth. But Dooley--the only Ventura player to
score in double figures--scored eight in a 10-3 run.</TE>
<TE>   Placentia El Dorado 65, Anaheim Katella 49--El Dorado's Melissa
Jacob scored 22 first-half points and finished with a career-high 36
points, tying a school record.</TE>
<TE>   Playa del Rey St. Bernard 59, La Puente Bishop Amat 46--Shannon
Clay scored 18 points for host St. Bernard (15-5, 3-1), which
outscored 22nd-ranked Bishop Amat, 14-1, in overtime of the Del Rey
League game. Erin Myrick scored 22 points for Bishop Amat (16-6,
2-2).</TE>
<TE>   In girls' soccer:</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point Dana Hills 2, San Clemente 1--Freshman Genelle Ives
scored the game-winner in the 79th minute for Dana Hills (10-4-3,
2-1-1), which upset No. 9 San Clemente (12-2-2, 2-1-1) in the South
Coast League game.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos 0, Anaheim Esperanza 0--Ashley De Lajandro made 12
saves to help visiting Los Alamitos tie fourth-ranked Esperanza.</TE>

<TE>   The tournament begins at 1 p.m. today and resumes at 9 a.m.
Saturday, with the finals scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Five Counties tournament, with most of the top teams in
California represented, is among the most prestigious tournaments in
the nation and offers a preview of the state championships, though
many Southland coaches view it as more important than the state
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's tougher than state, but it's a better
indication of your team strength," said Arnold Alpert, coach at
Temecula Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest difference between Five Counties and the state
tournament is that Five Counties has a 64-man bracket instead of a
32-man bracket.</TE>
<TE>   "At state, a lot of the guys are eliminated in their section
championships," Villa Park Coach Steve Stewart said. "You have to
travel a much tougher road to win at Five Counties."</TE>

<HD>Gonzaga Sticks Up for Little Guy</HD>

<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is why college basketball is better than college football:</LD>
<LD>   Gonzaga.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzaga against Pepperdine is as meaningful as Duke against
Maryland. Why? Because Pepperdine gets to see if it is
tournament-ready against a national power. When Fresno State and
Brigham Young threatened to have undefeated seasons and begged for
bowl champiosnhip series respect, they got jealousy instead from the
big schools.</LD>
<TE>   But in NCAA basketball, Gonzaga can exist.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga's national success--going to the NCAA tournament's Elite
Eight and Sweet 16, playing a national schedule and beating such
teams as Texas, New Mexico, Fresno State, Washington and Washington
State--brings the West Coast Conference national recognition and
respect. Three of Gonzaga's first five games were nationally
televised.</TE>
<TE>   As Gonzaga continues winning, the rest of the WCC teams will have
to keep getting better to stay competitive with the Zags. The WCC is
a little like the Atlantic 10 was a decade or so ago. Temple went out
and beat the big boys of college basketball in the NCAA tournament
and, during the regular season, on the road. Pretty soon
Massachusetts hired John Calipari and he did the same thing--took
UMass on the road and to the big time. Xavier and St. Joe's did the
same. Now the A-10 is right there with the Big East.</TE>
<TE>   So, as Gonzaga comes to town this weekend, first to play
Pepperdine and then Loyola Marymount, the Zags should be happily
welcomed. Gonzaga comes to town ranked 13th. Gyms in Malibu and on
the hill near LAX should be packed and raucous because that's how it
is when the best comes around.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the WCC being made better because of Gonzaga,
though. All college basketball fans can appreciate what has been
built in Spokane.</TE>
<TE>   When Fresno State and BYU threatened the status quo in college
football, when those two teams from outside the big six of college
football, interlopers with an affiliation other than Pac-10, Big Ten,
Big 12, Big East, SEC, ACC, there was much gnashing of teeth, pulling
of hair. How dare Fresno State or BYU think about going undefeated
and knocking on the BCS door? Send them away without any dinner and
certainly without a BCS bowl bid.</TE>
<TE>   How many of you were in a BCS pool? How many of you will be in an
NCAA basketball pool? This is what makes college basketball better
than college football. Everybody can matter.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody is welcome to be good and have dreams. Not only to have
dreams but to realize them. Hampton may not have won an NCAA title
last March but it beat Iowa State--a 15th-seeded team beating a No. 2
seed. Hampton was in the news.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the president of Hampton sent out a mailer, a
reminder to remember Hampton, its team, its coach, its cool band, its
success.</TE>
<TE>   The game is better for this.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga or Valparaiso or Hampton or any of the other lesser-known
schools that wins a game--or two or three--in the NCAA tournament
makes the game more fun for everybody. It's good for college
basketball everywhere that fans in Spokane, Wash., or Valparaiso,
Ind., or Hampton, Va., get excited in March. That excitement carries
over into November, December and January.</TE>
<TE>   The best single game of this season so far might have been played
on Philadelphia's Hawk Hill in a small gym that holds maybe 3,000,
depending on the span of the waving Hawk's wings. It was Gonzaga at
St. Joe's. Gonzaga won, 83-80, on a last-second shot. The noise from
Hawk Hill could be heard in Spokane. Almost, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's fair or not, conferences tend to be measured by the
success of teams in the NCAA tournament," WCC Commissioner Mike
Gilleran says.</TE>
<TE>   "Each time a team in a conference like ours wins an NCAA game,
that has a significant impact on the national scene. The hype, the
exposure on all the cable networks, all of the print media you get.
The effect of Gonzaga's success is significant and I don't use words
like 'significant' lightly."</TE>
<TE>   And because Gonzaga has made its NCAA noise, there will be
significant noise in Malibu tonight. And in San Diego and Santa Clara
and San Francisco and all the other WCC gyms in January and February.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just great for all of us," William Husak, Loyola
Marymount's athletic director, says. "We'll probably have one of our
biggest crowds of the year for Gonzaga. There will be a buzz and
that's good. It's good for Gonzaga and it's good for us."</TE>
<TE>   It's good for sports too. It's good when Southern California can
notice a game that doesn't include UCLA or USC. It's more fun that
way.</TE>
<TE>   "No one likes to see one team dominate the conference but Gonzaga
is great for all of us," Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal says. "There
is a lot of anticipation for Friday night's game. We'll be sold out.
The atmosphere is great.</TE>
<TE>   "And because Gonzaga has done what they've done year after year
now, Gonzaga is legitimized and, to a lesser degree, so is the
conference. We've played USC, UCLA, Arizona and Oregon and I honestly
think Gonzaga will be the best team we'll play. That's great. It's
great for a lot of reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Duke playing Maryland, of course that's a big deal. But so is
Pepperdine versus Gonzaga. Both games will have impact on the
tournament. Will Maryland get a No. 1 seed? Yes, if it can beat Duke.
Is Pepperdine NCAA-worthy? Well, if the Waves can beat Gonzaga--the
way they beat UCLA and USC--maybe so.</TE>
<TE>   It's good to have a national power to measure yourself against.
The WCC has it.</TE>

<HD>Russian Players Look for Way Out</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Two prospects, one the Ducks' top draft pick,
caught in web of international politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another chapter has begun in the tale of two prospects.</LD>
<LD>   Stanislav Chistov, a Mighty Duck draftee, and Alexander Svitov,
already under contract to Tampa Bay, appeared in a Moscow district
court last week, asking that their contracts with Avangard Omsk,
their team in the Russian Super League, be dissolved so they could
join HKCSKA, a second-division team, hockey sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The court returned the matter to Russian Hockey League officials
for settlement.</LD>
<TE>   Chistov, the fifth overall pick in June, and Svitov, the third
overall pick, are practicing with HKCSKA, run by legendary coach
Viktor Tikhonov. Hockey sources said that if they were allowed to
play for Tikhonov, who for years coached the former Soviet Union's
national team, then the Ducks and Lightning will likely be able to
make financial arrangements to bring them to the United States. Both
are believed to be under contract with Avangard Omsk through the
2004-05 season.</TE>
<TE>   "They are practicing with HKCSKA now and waiting for the next
step," said agent Jay Grossman, who will represent the players once
they are out of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov and Svitov, who led Russia to the world junior
championship earlier this month, have been caught in a hockey tug of
war since being drafted. Both were ordered home last summer under the
threat of being AWOL from the Russian army.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from both NHL teams said they were unaware that the
players were in the army. The Lightning signed Svitov in July and
expected him to play for the team this season. The Ducks did not sign
Chistov but they did bring him to Anaheim to rehabilitate a knee
injury after the draft. They were hoping he would attend training
camp next September.</TE>
<TE>   "The future seemed uncertain," Chistov said in Sports Express, a
Russian publication. "It was a bitter to end up in such a situation.
I was sent to the sports regiment [of the airborne forces]. My
service there continued 11 days, during which I practically did not
do a thing, though I did wear army boots."</TE>
<TE>   Anatoly Bardin, Avangard Omsk's president, boasted at the time
that he had won the battle with NHL teams and saved talented players
for Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the young players got a new trendy theme, 'I had an
injury. I left to rehabilitate it,'" Bardin said in Sports Express.
"This is all made up by the agents. They are used to doing their
things beyond law, ignoring contracts with players."</TE>

<HD>It Won't Be Easy for U.S.</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Costa Rica is considered team to beat in the sixth
CONCACAF Gold Cup as Americans come in at less than full strength.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today, the sixth CONCACAF Gold Cup opens in Miami, with five World
Cup-bound teams--Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, South Korea and the
United States--among the dozen participants.</LD>
<LD>   The biennial soccer tournament, barely a decade old, is being
split between the Orange Bowl and the Rose Bowl, with the Pasadena
stadium staging both semifinals on Jan. 30 as well as the
championship match on Feb. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Costa Rica is widely regarded as the favorite to win the event for
the first time, if only because Mexico, a three-time winner, has sent
a second-string team, while the U.S., winner of the inaugural
tournament in 1991 and twice a runner-up, does not have its
full-strength team available.</LD>
<TE>   Also likely to contend are the two invited teams: South Korea,
which plays the U.S. Saturday at the Rose Bowl, and Ecuador, the most
surprising of South America's World Cup qualifiers. Canada, the
defending champion, comes in as a dark horse.</TE>
<TE>   A capsule look at the 12 Gold Cup teams, in alphabetical order:</TE>
<TE>   CANADA</TE>
<TE>   German Coach Holger Osieck caused something of an upset in 2000
when he led the Canadians to their first international title. They
defeated Colombia, 2-0, in the championship match at the Coliseum.
Since then, things have not gone as well. Canada failed to qualify
for the 2002 World Cup, and its lone recent success was a 0-0 tie
with Brazil at the FIFA Confederations Cup in Japan in June. Most of
the players are European-based, which has given Osieck little time to
prepare the squad.</TE>
<TE>   COSTA RICA</TE>
<TE>   Still riding high after finishing in first place in the CONCACAF
World Cup qualifying tournament, Costa Rica should have little
difficulty winning its group. Brazilian Coach Alexandre Guimaraes can
call upon a strong and experienced team despite the absence of
forwards Paulo Wanchope and Ronald Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   The Ticos defeated 2000 Olympic gold medalist Cameroon, 2-1, last
Saturday, then found out belatedly that Cameroon had sent its reserve
team. Costa Rica is demanding the return of the $70,000 appearance
fee it paid to the African team.</TE>
<TE>   CUBA</TE>
<TE>   A soccer minnow among the CONCACAF big fish, Cuba comes into the
tournament with little to lose. Coach Miguel Company can expect his
inexperienced side to play two matches and head home.</TE>
<TE>   ECUADOR</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's players and coaches come to the U.S. with a bit more
money to spend. On Monday, Ecuador's soccer federation divided up
$745,000 among them for qualifying for Japan/Korea '02, which will be
the landlocked nation's first World Cup appearance. Ecuador has the
talent to win the Gold Cup, even without veteran midfielder Alex
Aguinaga and striker Agustin Delgado, perhaps the best-known of
Colombian Coach Hernan Dario Gomez's players. Ecuador defeated
Guatemala, 1-0, in front of 45,000 fans in Guayaquil on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   EL SALVADOR</TE>
<TE>   Having disappointed its many fans by failing to reach the World
Cup, El Salvador is rebuilding with an eye on the 2006 world
championship in Germany. Veteran playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos of the
Galaxy announced his retirement from the national team last week, but
Coach Carlos Humberto Recinos still has several capable players,
including Adonay Martinez and Ronald Cerritos who might help Ecuador
squeeze into the second round.</TE>
<TE>   GUATEMALA</TE>
<TE>   Coach Julio Cesar Cortes took his team to Cuba to prepare for the
Gold Cup, but a 1-0 victory and 0-0 tie achieved in Havana will not
have raised his hopes considerably. The 1-0 loss in Ecuador this week
won't have helped either. Still, Guatemala and El Salvador will have
fan support at the Rose Bowl and will be looking to take advantage of
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   HAITI</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Castelli, Haiti's coach, claims that the nation's soccer
federation is working hard to raise the level of the game in the
Caribbean island, but economic woes and consistent failure to qualify
for the World Cup since its only appearance in 1974 have hurt the
game's development. Haiti can expect a quick exit from the Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   MARTINIQUE</TE>
<TE>   If Cuba and Haiti are minnows, Martinique is merely bait. Its
first Gold Cup appearance since 1993 will be brief, given the caliber
of its group opponents.</TE>
<TE>   MEXICO</TE>
<TE>   Coach Javier Aguirre has reached a pact with Mexico's club coaches
that allows them to keep the country's top players now in exchange
for releasing them a little closer to the World Cup. As a result, the
Mexico team taking part in the Gold Cup is at best second-string and
perhaps even third-string. Aguirre covers this by saying as many as
16 spots on his World Cup roster are to be earned, but it seems
unlikely that they will come from players he acknowledges "are
looking to prove themselves both on and off the field."</TE>
<TE>   SOUTH KOREA</TE>
<TE>   Dutch Coach Guus Hiddink led the Netherlands to fourth place at
the 1998 World Cup in France, then later assumed the challenge of
guiding South Korea as it prepared to co-host the 2002 tournament
with Japan. He has achieved some successes, but the South Koreans,
who lost, 1-0, to the Galaxy in a scrimmage at Cal State Fullerton on
Wednesday, do not appear to have gelled as a team. Saturday's game
against the U.S., one of their opponents at the World Cup, will
better indicate their progress.</TE>
<TE>   TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO</TE>
<TE>   A dismal flop in World Cup qualifying, Trinidad and Tobago is
trying to make amends under Brazilian Coach Rene Simoes, whose
position remains anything but secure. Offensively talented but
defensively weak is the best way to describe the team, but that
should be enough for it to reach the second round. "We are not scared
to play against anyone," Simoes says.</TE>
<TE>   UNITED STATES</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bruce Arena's squad has been training in Claremont for two
weeks and has as good a chance at winning the Gold Cup as any of the
12 teams. Arena is relying on players from Major League Soccer teams
to form most of his starting lineup, with the only European-based
players called into camp being goalkeeper Kasey Keller, defender
Frankie Hejduk and midfielder Eddie Lewis.</TE>

<LD>It was a night to remember for Jerry Green, though not for all the
right reasons.</LD>
<LD>   UC Irvine's standout senior guard was scoreless in the first half,
finished with a season-low 10 points and committed two critical
turnovers in the final minute.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, after the Anteaters pulled out a 62-58 Big West Conference
victory Thursday over Pacific, many of the 3,104 at the Bren Center
chanted, "Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!"</LD>
<TE>   All was forgiven after Green sparked a comeback from a 15-point
halftime deficit and sealed Irvine's eighth consecutive victory by

to end the scoring, .</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to happen sometimes," Green said of his sub-par
performance. "I'm not going to worry about it as long as we win. ...
I'm glad it happened now than later in the season in the Big West
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   First-place Irvine (13-4, 6-0 in conference play) gained a measure
of revenge against Pacific (11-5, 3-3), which upset the Anteaters in
the semifinals of the Big West tournament last March.</TE>
<TE>   "We responded to the challenge in the second half," Irvine Coach
Pat Douglass said. "In the first half, [Pacific was] getting all the
loose balls and the extra rebounds."</TE>
<TE>   Center Adam Parada led four Anteaters in double figures with 15
points and also had 11 rebounds.</TE>

<TE>   Cal State Northridge 66, Long Beach State 54--The Matadors have
been taking baby steps, but they took a giant one in beating the
49ers at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Markus Carr had 22 points and five steals to lead Northridge
(5-10, 4-2 Big West), which won on the road for only the second time
this season and has won three of its last four games. Long Beach
(5-12, 1-5) lost its third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors made three of four field goals in the final 4:21 and
made eight of 10 free throws during that stretch. Long Beach,
meanwhile, did not make a field goal in the final 4:41.</TE>
<TE>   "This team has come a long way this season," Northridge Coach
Bobby Braswell said. "To show the kind of character they showed
tonight on somebody else's court shows they have grown up a lot."</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors moved into a tie for third in the Big West, and play
first-place UC Irvine Saturday night with a chance to move into
second place.</TE>

Beach.</TE>

<TE>   Utah State 68, UC Riverside 42--In front of a school-record
sellout crowd and a regional television audience, the Highlanders
developed stage fright as the Aggies (13-3, 5-2) led virtually from
start to finish at Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first regional telecast for Riverside and a raucous
3,168 showed up at the Student Recreation Center with several hundred
turned away. Lloyd Cook gave the crowd its only highlight with a
basket to start the game.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State scored the next seven points and quickly built the lead
to 11 with nine minutes gone. The Aggies led, 34-18, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Tony Brown burned Riverside all night with a season-high
five three-pointers and a game-high 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Coach John Masi said he sensed his team was emotionally
spent beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "Im not ashamed at the way we played," Masi said. "I kind of
expected this but I didn't expect that it would happen to this
extent. It got to be a situation where we played to the hype of the
game instead of just playing the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe this is the best way to get that message across."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Vague scored 17 points for the Aggies. In contrast, not one
Highlander reached double figures as they shot a season-low 33.3%.</TE>
<TE>   "Cook, Vili Morton and John Galbreath each finished with eight
points for Riverside.</TE>

<TE>   Idaho 63, Cal State Fullerton 59--The Titans (3-12, 0-6 Big West)
came up short again, falling to the Vandals (5-11, 2-5) before a
crowd of 717 at Fullerton. It was Fullerton's seventh loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to find a win somewhere in the last twelve games,"
Fullerton Coach Donny Daniels said. "Staying close isn't good enough.
This is a game we could have won if we had made a few key stops."</TE>
<TE>   Idaho didn't lead until David Howell's layup with 8:50 left,
giving the Vandals a 38-37 edge.</TE>

<HD>Arizona State Has Too Much for UCLA</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took Arizona State's 24th-ranked women's basketball team almost a
half to learn what every other team has done to beat UCLA this
season.</LD>
<LD>   Get used to the smothering array of defenses the Bruins employ,
then take advantage of UCLA's inevitable scoring lull to take over
the game.</LD>
<LD>   The Sun Devils followed the formula perfectly Thursday in a 70-57
victory before 725 at Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA hung around for almost 14 minutes in the first half,
trailing, 19-18, and keeping Arizona State out of a shooting rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bruins did not make another field goal in the final 6:17
of the half and went to the locker room trailing, 30-21.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half Arizona State made 16 of 20 shots to turn back
every rally attempt by UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   With a fourth consecutive victory, Arizona State (15-4, 6-2) took
sole possession of second place in the Pacific 10 Conference as USC
lost to Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins (5-11, 2-6) lost for the third time in four games.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly didn't take UCLA lightly," Arizona State Coach
Charli Turner Thorne said. "We got away from a few things tonight,
and weren't as aggressive as we should have been in the first half.
And UCLA does some things well defensively. They have the ability to
make you rush your shots."</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils' Amanda Levens, the conference's leading scorer,
was feeling the effects of the ankle sprain suffered last week and
had a quiet night with 11 points. But Arizona State had five players
in double figures, led by Cian Carvalho with 13.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin guard Whitney Jones, who had 15 points, said the team has
not quit on the season. "We're still determined we can do things
because we have ability," she said. "We just have to perform."</TE>

<TE>   Arizona 78, USC 74--The Trojans lost to the Wildcats in a Pac-10
game before 561 at the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Krause and Rachel Woodard each had a career-high 21 points
for USC (9-8, 5-3). Krause had 11 rebounds and Woodard 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were without starting forward Ebony Hoffman and
starting guards Tiffany Elmore and Aisha Hollans. Elmore is
recovering from a sprained ankle, while Hoffman was serving a
suspension for a fight in the UCLA game on Sunday. Hollans was
suspended for the game for violating team rules.</TE>
<TE>   LaKeisha Taylor and Aimee Grzyb had 15 points for Arizona (8-9,
4-4), which led, 36-29, at halftime.</TE>

<HD>Transfers Make Them Lose It</HD>
<DH>High schools: Fresno-area team forfeits rather than play
rival it says broke recruiting rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SELMA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In the raisin capital of the world, a coach and his basketball team
are taking a stand, which is why the gymnasium at Selma High will be
dark tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Selma is forfeiting rather than play San Joaquin Memorial in boys'
basketball this season because it believes its Central Sequoia League
rival broke transfer rules to admit two of its star players.</LD>
<LD>   "They've made their choices and we're making ours," Selma Coach
Randy Esraelian said. "Selma is leading the way in cleaning up high
school sports. We're willing to give up a chance for the league
championship in order to get this issue in the forefront."</LD>
<TE>   Already, Selma refused to play Memorial in the championship game
of a tournament, forcing organizers to revise the schedule. They will
take losses for league games tonight and on Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Memorial deny recruiting allegations. An
investigation concluded in September by the Central Section, the
organization that governs high school competition in the Central
Valley, cleared the school of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Those results aside, Esraelian, a fifth-grade teacher, said he
wants to set an example for his players by shedding light on
transfers who find a way to bend regulations, creating an "unlevel"
playing field.</TE>
<TE>   On that point, Selma, located 20 miles south of Fresno, may have
already won.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Section appointed a 12-member committee Wednesday for
a review of transfer policies. It was sparked in part by the flap
between Selma and Memorial and a recognition that current regulations
might not go far enough to crack down on recruiting and transfer
activities that critics say corrupt the spirit of high school sports.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, the number of high school athletes switching schools
has skyrocketed in recent years, frustrating coaches, administrators
and parents, and triggering calls for reform even within the
California Interscholastic Federation, the state governing body for
high school sports.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole state is trying to tighten transfer rules," said Jim
Crichlow, commissioner of the Central Section, which oversees Selma
and San Joaquin Memorial. "It's the No. 1 topic of discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the CIF's 10 sections keep transfer records, but many
coaches and administrators seem to agree the practice has reached
epidemic proportions in the City and Southern sections, which
supervises high schools competition in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In the 522-school Southern Section, there were nearly 3,800
athletic transfers--not counting moves prompted by a change in
residence--from the fall of 1999 through December of last year. The
60-school City Section had 945 in the same span.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes are allowed to keep their eligibility without changing
residence once in their four-year high school career. Transferring
for athletic purposes is not allowed, but students routinely use the
1994 state law on open enrollment to move from school to school.</TE>
<TE>   Open enrollment allows students to attend schools outside their
local district where there is space available. It was designed to
help improve academic performance by encouraging schools to compete
for top students, but critics say it has been used as a loophole by
athletes who want to switch to schools where they can better showcase
their athletic ability.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Staunton, commissioner of the Southern Section, the CIF's
largest section, estimates he and three assistant commissioners spend
four hours each working day on transfer forms, calls or inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   "Open enrollment has allowed a number of parents to relocate their
athletes if they become dissatisfied with their local school coach,"
Staunton said.</TE>
<TE>   Another common thread among transfers: The alleged influence of
club coaches. "The rise in club programs has caused a number of
coaches to advise parents on where to send their athletes," Staunton
said. "I see it as a manipulation of the system."</TE>
<TE>   The problem has grown so unsettling that some leagues and school
districts have started to implement their own transfer restrictions,
requiring athletes who change schools without moving to sit out one
varsity season. Others have been forced into action after
embarrassing incidents involving foreign-exchange students.</TE>
<TE>   Artesia High had to forfeit two section titles and all victories
in the 1997-98 and 1999-2000 seasons after eligibility questions were
raised about players from the Dominican Republic and Iceland.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the Clovis Unified School District voted to make
foreign-exchange students who transfer into the district ineligible
to compete at the varsity level for one year. The impetus was Charlie
Rodriguez, a basketball player from the Dominican Republic who
transferred to Clovis West and was found to be 19 as a sophomore.
Clovis West had to forfeit 70 boys' basketball victories and two
section titles in 1998-99 and 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a Superior Court judge in Stanislaus upheld a CIF
decision to declare two players from England, Richard Midgley and
Marc Pratt, ineligible this season at Modesto Christian High. They
led the school's basketball team to the state Division I final last
season. The CIF ruled they had exhausted their eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Transfers have become so influential that City Section
Commissioner Barbara Fiege said a coach recently suggested,
playfully, that, "Maybe our two [competitive] divisions should be
based on who has transfers and who doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fiege: "I laughed, but I'm thinking, 'Maybe it's not too
crazy.'"</TE>
<TE>   The transfers that sparked Selma's action brought Memorial guard
Dwain Williams from Riverside County and forward Antonio Lawrence
from Florida. Lawrence's mother was hired last summer to work in the
Memorial attendance office.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and Lawrence also play for a Fresno-based,
adidas-sponsored travel team run by Darren Matsubara, a former Cal
State Northridge player. Another member of Matsubara's travel team,
junior Nick Stigger from Memphis, Tenn., transferred to Van Nuys
Montclair Prep last month. Stigger, who is living in the school's
boarding facility, scored 36 points in his debut last week.</TE>
<TE>   Matsubara is an acquaintance of Wil Hooker, Memorial's first-year
coach. Selma officials believe Matsubara played a role in the
players' decision to transfer, allegations he denies.</TE>
<TE>   Matsubara has been out of town and unavailable for comment, but in
July he told the Fresno Bee that he did not steer Lawrence to
Memorial. "I would never tell him or any player where to go or not to
go," Matsubara told the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Crichlow, the Central Section commissioner, said he never received
a return phone call from Matsubara for his investigation. Memorial
also looked into the transfers, but didn't talk to Matsubara either.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Bojorquez, Selma's superintendent, said he was at a meeting
of the league's top-ranking administrators where Memorial officials
were questioned about their internal probe.</TE>
<TE>   "It was apparent they had not even talked to [their] coach about
whether he had any contact with Darren Matsubara.... That was one
flag," Bojorquez said. "An extensive investigation didn't take
place."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis DuPertuis, Memorial's vice principal, defends his school
and coach against recruiting allegations. He said both players
contacted the school about transferring before Hooker was hired as
coach. And he denied any school connection with Matsubara. "No one
from our school said to these students, 'Why don't you come here?'"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Sequoia League is comprised of Selma, Memorial and
three other schools, but only Selma has challenged the transfers. But
that doesn't mean others aren't supporting Selma.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sympathetic," Sierra Athletic Director Robert Hayden said. "I
guess someone has to stand up to the problems we've got."</TE>
<TE>   Selma is an unlikely lead crusader in transfer and recruiting
issues. With only one public high school in its 11-school district,
it's hardly an athletic powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of the Future Farmers of America club, which has
double the membership of the football team, is a reflection of those
who live in the surrounding blue-collar farming communities. The
130-acre headquarters for Sun-Maid Growers is located just three
miles away in Kingsburg and is one of the region's largest employers.
Nearly 74% of the 1,347 student body is Latino.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Memorial is the only Catholic school in Fresno,
well-respected for a college preparatory curriculum that costs $6,200
a year and enables 98% of its mostly white student body to move on to
four-year schools. Its football and girls' basketball teams have been
recognized among the best in the Fresno area. The boys' team entered
this week with a 14-5 record, including a victory over Garces, one of
the top teams in Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   Esraelian's teams have successfully competed against Memorial for
seven years, posting about 10 victories against four losses, the
coach estimated. The two transfers would make victories this season
especially challenging, but he is adamant that he is not ducking
Memorial because his team might get beat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about how bad they could beat us, or if we could beat
them," Esraelian said. "The whole point is, are we going to raise
this issue?"</TE>
<TE>   The decision to forfeit is viewed as courageous by some in the
community and a mistake by others. And it wasn't entirely popular
even on its own campus.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, it was a disappointment," Kendall Reynolds, a junior
who plays guard for Selma said of the decision. "Why not play them?
[But] as weeks went by, a lot of people understood."</TE>
<TE>   Superintendent Bojorquez said forfeiting games should be a last
resort--and it was. "The vast majority of people have been very
supportive of taking a stand because most people know [recruiting] is
happening and difficult to tie down," he said. "But something has to
be done."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time Selma has forfeited an athletic event to
Memorial--in 1978, the girls' basketball team forfeited to Memorial
because of similar recruiting allegations. And if the transfers keep
rolling in, it might not be the last.</TE>
<TE>   Said Esraelian: "We'll be playing for second place year in and
year out if it's not addressed."</TE>

<LD>Viewers are creatures of habit. When they want sports news, they
watch "SportsCenter."</LD>
<LD>   The show has been around for a long time, it's reliable and
well-produced, and although there has been some tweaking and
upgrading, there hasn't been much change in format over the years.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got a lot of tradition and history," says John Walsh, the
show's longtime executive editor. "And our people are always pushing
themselves."</LD>
<TE>   Besides its stability, "SportsCenter" has all of ESPN's resources
behind it--ESPNews, ESPN Radio and ESPN.com.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net and CNN/SI have discovered just how difficult--and
costly--it is to put a dent in the "SportsCenter" stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   CNN/SI recently told staff members it would cease operation in
May, and Fox Sports Net this week said it was dropping its "National
Sports Report" after Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net's news division isn't exactly running up a white
flag, but it does appear to be retreating.</TE>
<TE>   It will emphasize local sports news at the nine regional networks
it owns, including the two in Los Angeles, and national sports news
will be delivered in periodic updates. The plan is to eventually
expand local news shows, such as the "Southern California Sports
Report," to one hour and incorporate national news in those shows.</TE>
<TE>   That makes sense. What doesn't is to have so many updates.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new format, there will be two an hour--at nine and 39
minutes after the hour--throughout the night except during games. And
there will be four an hour during "The Best Damn Sports Show Period,"
but that's OK. They'll give viewers a break from Tom Arnold.</TE>
<TE>   But think how intrusive the news updates will be during "The Last
Word With Jim Rome." Worse will be the interruptions during "Beyond
the Glory" documentaries.</TE>
<TE>   By the time viewers get through a commercial break and an update,
they will have forgotten what they were watching.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Dolgin, Fox Sports Net's president, conceded that updates
may work better on some shows than others.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we've been debating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, in general, he is sold on delivering national sports updates.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done exhaustive research and what we've learned is that 62%
of our audience is made up of moderate sports fans, as opposed to
hard-core sports fans," he said. "And moderate sports fans want their
sports news delivered more frequently in headline format."</TE>
<TE>   Dolgin added that he hopes the updates will also draw new viewers,
who will like what they see.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it seems most viewers will not like the intrusive updates.</TE>
<TE>   They'll just click over to "SportsCenter," the real best damn
sports show period.</TE>
<TE>   The Other Side</TE>
<TE>   In this space last week, CBS' Billy Packer ripped into a "60
Minutes" report about the NCAA's treatment of athletes and a
coalition that is seeking reforms. Packer thought the piece, reported
by Lesley Stahl, was misleading and inaccurate, and he didn't pull
any punches in saying so.</TE>
<TE>   Rome Hartman, who produced the segment, said, "The story was not
about whether student-athletes should be paid. It was about a
question of fairness and hypocrisy, questions like, 'Should an
athletic scholarship cover the full cost of attendance?'"</TE>
<TE>   Hartman said another key issue in the piece dealt with the lack of
health insurance coverage during voluntary workouts, which really
aren't voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman called Packer a great basketball commentator, but said,
"He just has a blind spot when it comes to college athletics."</TE>
<TE>   Tough Business</TE>
<TE>   There's little stability in sports talk radio, , particularly for
women.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Cole, general manager of KMPC (1540), has been let go by the
station's parent company, the Sporting News network.</TE>
<TE>   "What bothers me is, after living and breathing this job the past
two years and building up the station, I have the rug pulled out from
under me," Cole said. "But I'm OK. I'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   During Cole's reign, the station changed its call letters, which
was her idea, added local sports flashes and two local shows, moved
twice and, most important, became the USC flagship station.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel, which owns KXTA (1150), sent an e-mail saying that
the latest Arbitron ratings show that among males 18 and over, the
time spent listening to the station had grown 33% since the last
rating period. The e-mail also said KXTA and XTRA (690) were the only
sports stations drawing enough listeners to be recognized by

<TE>   KXTA's listening time may be up, but according to an e-mail sent
by KSPN (1110), KXTA's share dropped from a .7 to a .4. KSPN reports
its share went from a .2 to a .3. KXTA still leads in number of
listeners per week, 185,200 to 137,300.</TE>
<TE>   Among males 18 and over, KSPN's Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian
have the No. 2 sports show in the market during afternoon drive time
with a 1 share. XTRA's Lee Hamilton has a 1.1. He has led his time
slot for more than 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   KSPN's "Ringside With Johnny Ortiz" showed a 300% increase with a
.8 share in men 25-54. The show ranks No. 1 among Sunday night sports
shows in that age group.</TE>
<TE>   More Radio Bites</TE>
<TE>   This may break the hearts of Stu Nahan fans, but Nahan will not be
back doing Dodger pregame shows for KXTA this season. A. Martinez
will be paired with Ross Porter, who is 100% since undergoing sinus
surgery late last season.... This is the last year KXTA has the
Dodgers, but the station still went all out in its coverage of the
Gary Sheffield trade. So did KSPN.... The Angels will be hard pressed
to find a better announcing team than Mario Impemba and Daron Sutton,
who have gone on to other jobs.</TE>

<TE>   The women's final of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships on
Saturday night, relegated to the ABC Family Channel, still got a
solid 3.4 national cable rating, which translates to a 2.7 rating for
all homes. The L.A. rating for all homes was a 3.5. ABC's repeat on
Sunday got a 4.3 national rating. By combining the 2.7 Saturday night
rating with the 4.3, you get a 7, which beats the 6 rating ABC got
for last year's women's final.... Some DirecTV subscribers complained
that they missed Saturday night's skating. DirecTV carries the East
Coast feed from channels such as ABC Family, meaning it was on live
at 5 p.m. here instead of delayed at 8 p.m., as it was on cable.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's new three hours of Sunday night programming, running from
5-8 p.m. and called "The Block," debuts this weekend. Featured Sunday
at 5 is the beginning of a 13-episode series that follows the North
Charleston Lowgators of the NBDL, the NBA's new developmental league.
The featured show on Jan. 17 will be something called "The World's
Sexiest Athletes," presented by Us magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended viewing: It will be "NFL Greats Week" beginning Monday
on A&amp;E's "Biography." The series will feature, in order, Frank
Gifford, Joe Montana, Walter Payton, Vince Lombardi and Joe Namath.
The shows are produced by NFL Films.... If you're looking for
something to get you in the mood for the Winter Olympics, there's an
entertainment special on NBC Saturday at 10 p.m. Also, a DVD of HBO's
outstanding documentary, "Do You Believe in Miracles? The Story of
the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team," is available in stores.</TE>

<DH>College basketball: Barnes, Knight and Gadzuric help UCLA
hang on for 82-79 victory over Arizona State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>This was a dreaded "sandwich game," wedged between bread-and-butter
battles against ranked opponents--Kansas and Arizona, in UCLA's case.</LD>
<LD>   Sure enough, Arizona State made like peanut butter, posing a
sticky challenge. But just when it appeared the Bruins would choke,
relief came from a comforting source.</LD>
<LD>   Got seniors?</LD>
<TE>   Four-year veterans Matt Barnes, Billy Knight and Dan Gadzuric made
the plays down the stretch in the ninth-ranked Bruins' 82-79 victory
Thursday night in front of 9,013 at Wells Fargo Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the contribution was reflected in numbers. Knight had 21
points, seven rebounds and three steals. Barnes had 19 points, nine
rebounds and four assists. Gadzuric had 14 points and eight rebounds,
with all the rebounds and 10 of the points coming in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   But some key plays can't be measured. Call them senior moments.</TE>
<TE>   A comfortable lead dwindled to three with 8.9 seconds left after
the frigid-shooting Sun Devils inexplicably got hot, making four of
their five three-point baskets in the last 2:34.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin freshman Cedric Bozeman was fouled with 8.9 seconds left and
missed two free throws, but Barnes reached over Arizona State's
Justin Allen and muscled for the rebound. His putback missed, but
this time Knight went up hard, forcing a jump ball with 6.2 on the
clock and the Bruins had possession.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't over. Jason Kapono was stripped after taking an inbounds
pass and Curtis Millage weaved down the floor, launching an
off-balance 20-foot shot that bounced off the front of the rim as the
horn sounded.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes also was a money player. As Kapono prepared to shoot two
free throws with 39.1 seconds left and the score 76-72, Barnes
noticed coins rolling on the floor and brought them to the referee's
attention.</TE>
<TE>   A technical foul was issued because earlier Arizona State had been
given a warning when pizza was tossed from the stands. While Sun
Devil Coach Rob Evans protested and the crowd wailed, Kapono made all
four freebies and UCLA's lead was eight.</TE>
<TE>   "When the game is close, you let the players decide things," Evans
said. "[The officials] never told me to quiet the crowd. They said we
had a warning but I didn't know of any warning."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, it was a much more difficult victory than the 10-point
win over No. 1 Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have to win ugly and we found a way to grind out a
win on the road," Coach Steve Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Barnes: "This was the type of game the younger players
haven't been in. [The seniors] know what it takes to win."</TE>
<TE>   So UCLA (13-3, 5-1 in the Pac-10) left fat and happy, with a day
off to prepare for No.15 Arizona and the rigors of playing in McKale
Center, where none of the current Bruins have won.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we have to get up for all the games," Barnes said. "This
game was as important as Kansas and Arizona."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes picked up where he left off in scoring 34 and 27 last week
against USC and Kansas, making a three-point basket and a scoop shot
in the paint for the game's first five points.</TE>
<TE>   Next it was Knight. Arizona State (10-6, 3-4) used a full-court
press to overcome cold shooting and take its first lead, 29-28, with
two minutes left in the first half. But Knight made UCLA's last eight
points--including a steal and layup in the final seconds--and the
Bruins led, 36-31.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono tried to get out of his habitual first-half doldrums by
taking six shots, but he made only two and missed three from long
range. He finished with 20 points, however, making eight of nine free
throws, and appeared comfortable playing a wing rather than point
guard.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman played 21 minutes at the point, and Ryan Walcott spelled
him for 12 minutes. This was a homecoming for Walcott, a redshirt
freshman from Phoenix Shadow Mountain High, and he responded with two
points, two rebounds, an assist and only one turnover.</TE>
<TE>   There were more minutes to go around than usual because starter
Rico Hines sat out. He is still experiencing headaches from a
concussion suffered at practice 10 days ago and is questionable for
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   But his fellow seniors made up for his absence.</TE>
<TE>   "First it's Dan on both ends of the floor, then Billy, then Matt,"
Lavin said. "Our older players know what it takes to close out
basketball games."</TE>

<HD>Luke Fills Bill for Arizona</HD>
<DH>USC: Walton's first career triple-double leads Wildcats to
97-80 victory over Trojans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Henry Bibby admitted earlier this week that he didn't know what to
expect from rebuilding Arizona, which lost four starters to the NBA
draft last summer.</LD>
<LD>   But the USC coach never in his wildest dreams imagined what
happened Thursday night at McKale Center, the Trojans' personal House
of Horrors.</LD>
<LD>   In front of a sellout and raucous crowd of 14,574, the 18th-ranked
Trojans saw their nine-game winning streak come to a crashing halt at
the hands of No. 15 Arizona, 97-80.</LD>
<TE>   The Wildcats were led by Luke Walton's 27 points, 11 rebounds and
10 assists. It was the first career triple-double for the son of Hall
of Famer Bill Walton.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were never really in it and, according to USC senior
Sam Clancy, some of his teammates gave up in the middle of the game,
which Arizona led by as many as 31 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say that," said Clancy, after claiming some Trojans
quit.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy had a season-high 30 points and 11 rebounds for his
league-leading eighth double-double of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think coach did a good thing by playing a lot of the
younger guys," Clancy said.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan sophomore Desmon Farmer had 13 points in 29 minutes off the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   Little-used senior guard Gennaro Busterna, who entered the game
without a point in his two-year USC career, finished with 10 points
in six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Derrick Craven also saw his first significant time
of the season , scoring two points in 11 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But absent was production from senior starters Brandon Granville
and David Bluthenthal, who combined for five points.</TE>
<TE>   Granville was held scoreless for the first time since his
sophomore year.</TE>
<TE>   "Shots weren't falling and our defense was atrocious," Clancy
said. "[Arizona forward Luke] Walton was having a field day like he
was an All-American."</TE>
<TE>   Walton, barreling over people in the lane all game, was called for
just one foul in a game-high 38 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   With the 6-foot-8 Walton extremely active at the top of the key,
USC had trouble with Arizona's 3-2 zone defense to open the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans made just one of their first nine shots and committed
three turnovers before the game was five minutes old.</TE>
<TE>   USC made two of its first 22 shots and five of its first 29 before
finishing the first half at nine for 35, 25.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona took a 10-0 lead fewer than three minutes into the game
before USC answered with a mini-run to close the gap to six points,
11-5, following a Sam Clancy score at the 15:25 mark.</TE>
<TE>   But the Wildcats began toying with the Trojans and went on a 23-4
run over the next nine-plus minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The run gave Arizona a 27-point lead with six minutes still to
play until halftime.</TE>
<TE>   USC's starting backcourt of Granville and freshman Errick Craven
was a combined 0 for 10 from the field in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona scored the first six points of the second half to go up by
a game-high 31 points, 57-26, before Farmer hit a three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they were going to play zone," Bibby said. "Guys just
didn't step up and guys were out of position. We couldn't stop them.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [Arizona] played well. You have to give them credit.
They executed on both ends of the floor. They made us work and we
didn't have the patience on either end of the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby wasn't so sure, though, that Walton's presence at the top of
the key in the 3-2 zone was the determining factor.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not penetrate and we did not drive so we played right into
their hands," Bibby said. "You could have put [Arizona Coach] Lute
Olson out there [at the top of the zone] and it wouldn't have
mattered."</TE>
<TE>   USC (13-3, 5-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play) shot 32.9% from the
field, 23.3% (7 of 30) from beyond the three-point stripe. The
Trojans' losing streak at Arizona reached 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona (12-4, 5-2) made 54.4% of its shots, 40.0% (eight of 20)
of its three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   USC outrebounded Arizona, 47-44.</TE>
<TE>   Olson's record against the Trojans at home improved to 18-1.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved the ball the best that we have moved it all year long,"
Olson said. "We did a great job of taking care of the ball until the
last three minutes when we got a little sloppy.</TE>
<TE>   "The only problem we had was that we didn't get on some of their
three-point shooters a few times. We gave up too many boards, but
they are awfully tough on the offensive boards."</TE>

<HD>Metrolink Adds Tustin Station, Hopes to Subtract Freeway Users</HD>
<DH>Transit: The new $7-million platform could also relieve a parking
crunch at the stop in Irvine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commuter rail supporters will unveil Orange County's newest
Metrolink station today--a $7-million, automated railway pit stop
officials hope will ultimately boost the line's modest yet growing
ridership.</LD>
<LD>   The station, in Tustin on a 3.7-acre parcel at Edinger Avenue and
Jamboree Road, is the first of several new platforms planned throughout
Orange County and will open for business before dawn Monday. It features
vaulted canopies and an underground passageway with skylights, and is
intended to relieve parking congestion at the nearby Irvine Metrolink
station.</LD>
<LD>   "This is going to be a huge help to commuters who live between Irvine
and Santa Ana," said Sarah L. Catz, a Metrolink director and former
member of the Orange County Transportation Authority. "It will absolutely
increase ridership because it will increase convenience."</LD>
<TE>   In terms of commuter convenience, the station offers automated ticket
machines, drinking fountains, bicycle racks, newspaper boxes and
telephones. However, the one amenity it doesn't offer commuters is a
restroom--a detail left out for fear it would encourage loitering and
attract the homeless, according to one transportation official.</TE>
<TE>   Officials, however, say the lack of a latrine is not unusual for such
platforms and poses no real inconvenience to commuters.</TE>
<TE>   "The bathrooms are on the train," Catz said. "Besides, most people
don't linger at these platforms. Most people are racing to take care of
their kids and get to the station on time. They usually jump on the train
as soon as they get there."</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin platform is along Metrolink's Orange County Line and will
serve commuters destined for Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside and San
Bernardino counties. The platform does not offer Amtrak or freight
service.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials hailed the station as an opportunity to reduce freeway
congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "Sitting on the 22 in bumper-to-bumper traffic is no fun," said Tustin
City Councilman Tony Kawashima as he sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic on
the Garden Grove Freeway and talked on his mobile phone. "If this station
helps take cars off the freeway and reduces congestion, I'm all for it."</TE>
<TE>   Overall daily ridership along the county's two Metrolink lines is
roughly 4,500--a number that critics say is small compared with the
millions of car trips made daily by county residents. Still, officials
say their ridership continues to grow and will gain an added boost from
the new Tustin and other planned platforms.</TE>
<TE>   A Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo station is scheduled to be completed in
the spring, and a platform in Buena Park is scheduled to open next year.
Plans are also in the works for a station in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin station offers 324 parking spaces. OCTA officials said the
station will help relieve chronic parking problems at the Irvine station.</TE>
<TE>   At that station, more than a third of the parking lot's spaces are
taken up by second cars left overnight by commuters. The owners use the
cars to get around during the work day, then leave them in the lot when
they take the train home.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this new station will take some of the parking pressure
off," said George Urch, an OCTA spokesman.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three people suffered minor injuries in a 15-car crash Thursday
evening that closed the connector road between the northbound Eastern
tollway and eastbound Riverside Freeway for about three hours, California
Highway Patrol and fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred about 5:50 p.m. when a tow truck towing a pickup
came around the curve on the connector route, where traffic had slowed,
CHP Officer Mark Reeves said.</LD>
<LD>   The tow truck driver was unable to stop and tried to drive between two
lanes, striking about 14 cars before coming to rest on top of a Lincoln
Continental. The woman driving the Lincoln was trapped under the tow
truck for about an hour before being extricated.</LD>
<TE>   Paramedics transported two other people to hospitals, fire officials
said. Details about their injuries were not available late Thursday.</TE>

<DH>Diversity: The Korean Business District is finally official in
Garden Grove today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Kim moved his real-estate office to Garden Grove Boulevard
in 1977, the fifth Korean American business to open along a mile-long
stretch in the city. Now the thoroughfare is at least 80% Korean.</LD>
<LD>   Today the city's Korean American community will celebrate the
installation of a new city monument, facing west, at the Brookhurst Way
end of the commercial section. The monument officially names the
mile-long stretch as the Korean Business District, designated so by the
city.</LD>
<LD>   It's the second bookend for the district. A year ago, a committee of
the Korean Chamber of Commerce installed a similar monument, facing east,
at the stretch's western boundary at Fern Street.</LD>
<TE>   Both monuments were paid for with private funds raised by the Korean
American businesses. Both say "Welcome" in Korean on the front and "Leave
safely" in Korean on the back. The new one carries the city seal in front
and the Korean Chamber of Commerce seal in back.</TE>
<TE>   "These monuments are symbolic for us," said Euiwon Chough, chairman of
the chamber's Korean Business District Committee. "It tells all of Orange
County that this is a place where they can come to shop or dine at Korean
businesses. But it also says that Garden Grove is a city of diversity,
which benefits all ethnic groups here."</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, when Korean American business owners approached the
city with the idea, the proposal foundered. Chough said some City Council
members feared such a move would be giving preferential treatment to one
ethnic group. But in 1999, with new members aboard, the council approved
the official designation as the Korean Business District. The business
leaders rejected earlier proposals from within their group that it be
called Korea Town or Little Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager George Tindall said the growing popularity of Little
Saigon in Westminster made it easier for Garden Grove residents to accept
such a designation.</TE>
<TE>   The city's decision has stirred up almost no controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, we had grumbling from a couple of businesses in that area
that were not Korean," said Mayor Bruce Broadwater, who plans to attend
today's 11 a.m. ceremony. "But since that first monument went up, I
haven't had a single complaint."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Garden Grove Boulevard was little more than a length of
closed-up storefronts and decaying buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, it was a slum," said Kim, of Sunny Realty. "But that was the
appeal. Not many Koreans could afford to own their own businesses then.
With prices on Garden Grove Boulevard so low, it made it easier for them
to get a start."</TE>
<TE>   A few of the first businesses failed. Though Kim's realty office was
fifth to move in, it's the oldest business still operating. The business
association now has about 350 members.</TE>

<HD>Man Arrested for Allegedly Making Threats</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Air Force Reserve medic was arrested Thursday after he
allegedly threatened to shoot a Valencia teacher and her co-workers,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies booked Mathieu Dyer, 32, of Frazier Park on
suspicion of making terrorist threats, in connection with calls he made
to his former girlfriend, a schoolteacher at Helmers Elementary School in
Valencia.</LD>
<LD>   Other teachers at the school said Dyer said Monday that he'd shoot
them, authorities said. When detectives asked Dyer about those reports,
he said he meant "chute," as in "parachute." Dyer spelled out "chute" in
some of his calls, Sheriff's Lt. Tim Peters said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators confiscated several handguns, rifles, shotguns and 2,600
rounds of ammunition from Dyer's home.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter what he says he meant when it comes to a terrorist
threat," Peters said. "It matters that the victims believed his threat
and that he had a present ability to carry it out."</TE>

<LD>A challenger to incumbent Judge Ronald C. Kline, who has been
charged with molestation and possessing child pornography, has asked the
Board of Supervisors to take Kline's name off the March 5 election ballot
because he allegedly submitted invalid nomination documents.</LD>
<LD>   Gay Sandoval, a write-in candidate, said at least one of the
signatures on Kline's nomination papers, that of Judge William R.
Froeberg, was mistakenly included.</LD>
<LD>   Froeberg said he overlooked Kline's name on the papers when he and
other judges running for reelection held a "signing party" about two
weeks after the first charges against Kline were filed.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith said that the board lacks the power to take
Kline's name off the ballot.</TE>

will receive about $85,000 to engage 420 elementary school students in a
variety of service projects.</LD>

<HD>O.C. and 91 Express Lanes: a Loveless Marriage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA PARSONS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marriages of convenience seldom end well. The parties pretend
they're equals, but in reality, one party ends up holding more power than
the other. Wise owls on the outside see that, and even as they stand in
the aisles shouting, "Don't do it! Don't do it!" the parties go ahead and
get married anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a few years down the pike . . . blooey.</LD>
<LD>   Things are going blooey between Orange County and the private company
that operates the 91 Express Lanes on the Riverside Freeway, which links
Orange and Riverside counties.</LD>
<TE>   The two were conjoined several years ago after the state agreed to let
private companies build toll lanes. In those early, heady days, Orange
County eagerly joined in the union by embracing private builders, even as
some outsiders thought the public-private match was a bad one.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone reading the prenuptial agreement, however, could see that there
was no love there--just a mutual need. Unfortunately, the state needed
private enterprise a little bit more than the other way around, so guess
who's paying for that imbalance now?</TE>
<TE>   Correct: You.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Transportation Agency is forking over $4 million to
the California Private Transportation Co. in exchange for the company
sitting there and doing nothing. You might want to make a note to
yourself to consider working for a company like that.</TE>
<TE>   The money is part of an overall $12 million for a project to add a
lane in Orange County to the bottled-up commuter freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Transportation will pay about $8 million for
the widening project.</TE>
<TE>   The other $4 million? That will be given to the company to offset a
potential loss of its business due to the widened freeway.</TE>
<TE>   If that's confusing, it's probably because you think a public agency
shouldn't have to pay a private company when the state wants to make
improvements on a state highway.</TE>
<TE>   That's what some people (but not enough) worried about in 1993 when
Caltrans agreed not to make improvements on the freeway--except for
safety reasons--in the area where the proposed Express Lanes would go.
The reason was that such improvements might make people less likely to
use the privately owned Express Lanes and, therefore, be unfair to a
company building the lanes.</TE>
<TE>   If it makes it easier to grasp, just think of the $4 million OCTA will
be paying as the price of a shotgun wedding.</TE>
<TE>   The private company is nobody's fool. Caltrans tried to slip in a
freeway improvement a few years ago, but the company reacted with a
lawsuit. Caltrans, realizing who wore the pants in this union, backed
off.</TE>
<TE>   By then, all the naysayers of this marriage between public and private
interests were saying, "I told you so."</TE>
<TE>   The most galling element was that the state couldn't improve its own
roadway--not the part owned by the private company--if those improvements
hurt the private company's business.</TE>
<TE>   That, in essence, reduced the state to just another private company
that had to dance to the tune of a dominant competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Many people now believe the marriage is doomed. The state isn't saying
much, but Orange County has made it clear it wants out. The private
company has indicated it is amenable to a split if the terms are
right--if only because it's probably tired of the sniping.</TE>
<TE>   The company entertained the thought of selling the lanes to a private
nonprofit group, but that $225-million transaction collapsed in 1999 when
the state had misgivings.</TE>
<TE>   Now, OCTA says it's interested in buying the lanes.</TE>
<TE>   If so, it would turn the clock back to 1989 when the Legislature first
said yes to the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, the arrangement may have made sense. Both thought they were
getting something from the other: The state didn't want to pay for major
freeway projects, and private interests were eager to get into the
highway-building business.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the 91 Express Lanes opened. The state--along with a ready
and willing Orange County--linked its sacred honor with private industry
out there on the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Courtship, marriage, breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, it was a great five years, wasn't it?</TE>

<HD>Airmen Return to Point Mugu to Cries of Joy After War Duty</HD>
<DH>Military: The pilots, back after months in Afghanistan, are swept
up by their families after the squadron lands at the Navy base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of directing bombing raids over Afghanistan, five E-2C
Hawkeye aircraft emerged over Point Mugu Naval Air Station on Thursday to
the cheers and cries of the pilots' families waiting below.</LD>
<LD>   Flying in diamond formation, the special radar-equipped surveillance
planes banked steeply before rolling onto the runway at the Navy base.</LD>
<LD>   Moments later, wives and children sprinted to the planes, nearly
tackling the 20 airmen as they appeared.</LD>
<TE>   For most, it had been more than six months since they had seen their
husbands and fathers. Some quickly made up for lost time.</TE>
<TE>   "Give papa a hug! Give papa a kiss! Tell papa what a cow says!" Lauren
Valluzzi Carambas urged her 1-year-old daughter, Madaline.</TE>
<TE>   Farther down the tarmac, Marina Pham toddled over to Lt. Cmdr. Tony
Pham.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been gone half her life," Pham said, hoisting his 1-year-old
daughter into his arms. "When I last saw her she couldn't walk."</TE>
<TE>   Airborne Early Warning Squadron 117 left Point Mugu on July 27 on
routine deployment aboard the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson. The carrier
was the closest ship to the Persian Gulf on Sept. 11, when the attacks on
the World Trade Center and Pentagon occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The squadron was quickly moved to the gulf and the Hawkeyes, the
Navy's newest carrier-based command-and-control aircraft, were among the
first planes used in the air war over Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The propeller-driven Hawkeyes, which have a large rotating radar disc
on top, flew over Afghanistan and instructed allied fighter and bomber
aircraft where to drop their payloads.</TE>
<TE>   "We were like the guys at the football game high up in the coach's box
looking down at the field and directing the plays," said Lt. Cmdr.
Michael Carambas, 35, of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   The airmen said they often attracted machine gun and antiaircraft fire
but were never hit.</TE>
<TE>   "You had to be flexible, because the game plan changes all the time,"
29-year-old Lt. Frank Perry said. "You might get a target and then have
to cancel and go somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way they picked up Al Qaeda transmissions, Carambas said.</TE>
<TE>   The planes flew every day for at least five hours and in November
logged 500 hours, said Commanding Officer John C. Oberst, 44, of
Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "We were doing battle management," Oberst said. "Every aircraft in the
theater would have to check in with us. Some came with bombing targets
and we would give targets to others."</TE>
<TE>   The planes left the deck of the Carl Vinson on Thursday morning when
it was still about 850 miles from its next stop in San Diego, Navy
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the pilots' arrival, relatives crowded inside a cavernous,
festively decorated hangar. Many were dressed in red, white and blue, and
some carried flags. Music, including Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind,"
filled the air. But the mood was one of restrained joy: No one wanted to
celebrate until the crewmen were safely on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Over the months, the families stayed in contact with the airmen via
e-mail and occasional phone calls. But their absence was difficult. Small
children such as Marina learned to eat solid food, hold a cup and finally
to take her first steps while her father was away. Wives had to juggle
the needs of their children and the mundane tasks of daily life alone.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't take a shower by yourself, can't eat in peace," said one
wife and mother. "It's nonstop, seven days a week. I don't know how
single mothers do it."</TE>
<TE>   And when the Sept. 11 attacks occurred, they faced it alone, not
knowing what it meant for them or their loved ones aboard the Carl
Vinson.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 was the only time I broke down," said Jodie Dodge, 25, of
Oxnard, the wife of Lt. Cmdr. Matt Dodge. "I didn't know where he was."</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes Pham, 31, of Ventura said she had no idea what would happen
to her husband after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew he was involved but didn't know the details," Pham said.</TE>
<TE>   For now the airmen plan to stay on the ground for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Molly Oberst, 45, wants to take a vacation with her husband, the
commanding officer of the wing.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly I just want to take care of him," she said. "And I want him to
take care of me."</TE>

<HD>Newhall Ranch Hits New Hurdle</HD>
<DH>Housing: An L.A. County supervisor seeks to postpone the board's
decision on the massive development because of water issues. Opponents
applaud the action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest development in Los Angeles County history--already
stalled for 20 months by a judge who questioned its water supply
projections--has been swept off course again by another legal tussle over
water.</LD>
<LD>   Newhall Ranch, a proposed 21,600-home subdivision just east of
Fillmore across the Los Angeles County line, was scheduled for action
next week by the county Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   But Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, said Thursday
he will ask to delay the board decision for at least three months until
courts resolve water rights in a valley whose population is expected to
at least double during the next two decades.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to ensure that there is sufficient water for the residents of
the Santa Clarita Valley before any project is approved," Antonovich said
in a brief statement.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Newhall Ranch said they were pleased by Antonovich's
decision. Ventura County Supervisor Kathy Long applauded his "leadership
and due diligence."</TE>
<TE>   "They should take another look at it," she said, adding that Ventura
County still disputes Newhall's latest analysis of water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The delay underscores California's growing recognition of the need to
tie suburban growth to water availability. Newhall Ranch has played a key
role in the evolving debate as it reverberated from the farms of Kern
County to the corridors of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich was reacting to a court decision last week that could
jeopardize water supplies for the Castaic Lake Water Agency, a wholesaler
that serves the Santa Clarita Valley. At issue are rights to 41,000
acre-feet of water a year from the Kern County Water Agency to Castaic.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich decided that because that source of the Newhall Ranch water
has been thrown in doubt, the supervisors should delay action on the
environmental impact report for the development.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. proposes to use only a small
portion of that water for its Newhall Ranch development, about 1,600
acre-feet annually, Los Angeles County officials said Thursday they want
to make sure the Castaic agency's rights are clear.</TE>
<TE>   "The status of water in the Santa Clarita Valley is unclear,"
Antonovich deputy Conal McNamara said. "The board is not in a position to
make any kind of a decision [on Newhall Ranch]."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County supervisors unanimously approved Newhall Ranch in
late 1998, over the objections of Ventura County and several
environmental groups, which challenged the action in court.</TE>
<TE>Judge Ordered Company to Guarantee Water</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, Kern County Superior Court Judge Roger D. Randall blocked
construction of the 12,000-acre development on the banks of the Santa
Clara River until Newhall Land could prove it had enough water to supply
the new community.</TE>
<TE>   Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman for Newhall Land, said Thursday that the
developer has since conducted more than 30 studies and cut deals to buy
and store enough water to meet nearly twice the expected demand of 70,000
residents.</TE>
<TE>   The water wars and other environmental challenges to Newhall Ranch
have knocked the project years off schedule. Construction, once scheduled
to start in late 2000, may now be delayed beyond 2004, Lauffer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, no one is more painfully aware of the delays than us,"
she said. "We certainly would have liked to have been further along than
this."</TE>
<TE>   Lauffer said that the most recent court decision "will have minimal,
if any, effect on Newhall Ranch's water supply." The suburb is expected
to need 17,600 acre-feet per year, less than 10% of which would come from
the Castaic Lake transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, in recent years no-growth activists have used water as
one of the main tools to stop development," Lauffer said. "What we have
shown . . . is the availability and reliability of water isn't really an
issue. The water is there, and the technology is in place to deliver and
store it. It's an issue we feel very comfortable about."</TE>
<TE>Some Promised Water Exists Only on Paper</TE>
<TE>   The Castaic Lake Water Agency now needs 68,000 acre-feet yearly to
serve its customers, spokeswoman Mary Lou Cotton said. About 36,000
acre-feet comes from State Water Project entitlements, and the rest is
obtained from local ground water. One acre-foot equals 326,000 gallons,
enough to supply two families for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the agency has rights to 95,200 acre-feet annually from
the state, including the Kern County transfer, Cotton said. But critics,
noting that the state often cannot deliver the full amount promised, say
much of the supply consists of "paper water" rather than the wet kind.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy that they are taking this court decision seriously,"
said Lynne Plambeck, president of the citizens group Santa Clarita
Organization for Planning and the Environment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a setback not only for Newhall Ranch, but for all the other
projects [underway in Santa Clarita]," she said. "Developers are grading
for 10,000 new units out here that they do not have a water supply for."</TE>

<LD>Jamie Franceschi goes to church twice each Sunday, so she can get
more choir time in.</LD>
<LD>   Sean Chen likes to draw and build model cars but makes time to
practice the piano 1 1/2 hours a day.</LD>
<LD>   Laurel Schwartz says her interests include traveling, photography and
partying, but also gives music lessons to elementary students several
days a week.</LD>
<TE>   The three young soloists from Ventura County are among seven who will
perform today and Saturday in the New West Symphony's Discovery Artists
series, conducted by symphony music director Boris Brott.</TE>
<TE>   Franceschi, a 23-year-old Thousand Oaks resident, began singing and
dancing when she was 6.</TE>
<TE>   In her first performance, she sang a song from the musical "Annie."</TE>
<TE>   She was introduced to the opera world when she was 12, but she said it
was not until she learned her first aria four years ago that she fell in
love with classical singing.</TE>
<TE>   But she isn't ruling any genre out.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be a singer, any kind of singer--jazz, popular or
classical--as long as I can have the opportunity to sing," Franceschi
said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, she goes to Mass twice every Sunday so she can sing in the
choir at St. Jude's Catholic Church in Westlake Village.</TE>
<TE>   Laurel, a 17-year-old Oak Park student, has played the piccolo for
seven years.</TE>
<TE>   She attributes years of going to New West Symphony concerts with
giving her an appreciation for all types of music.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago she won a spot with the New West Youth Symphony, where
she has held the first chair position for piccolo.</TE>
<TE>   The Westlake High senior, who has also won honors in science and
Spanish, plays the flute--she gives lessons to elementary school
students--but likes the piccolo "because it's more of a novelty. No one
else plays it."</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen-year-old Sean, also of Oak Park, has been playing piano for
seven years.</TE>
<TE>   The Medea Creek Middle School eighth-grader has earned many honors and
awards, including honors at the 2000 and 2001 Southern California Junior
Bach Festivals.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was just a toddler, he would go and sit and play with an old
broken keyboard," Sean's father, Eric Chen, said.</TE>
<TE>   Musical ability runs in the family, Eric Chen said. Eric's
grandfather, Cheng-Tin Chen, 76, conducts an orchestra in Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   The Discovery Artists series, now in its eighth year, is an outgrowth
of the Young Artists Competition of the former Ventura County Symphony.
The symphony will open with the overture to "Russlan and Ludmilla" by
Mikhail Glinka and will end with the New West Youth Symphony All Stars,
selected members of the Youth Symphony Orchestra, performing "The Great
Gate of Kiev" from "Pictures at an Exhibition" by Modeste Mussorgsky.</TE>
<TE>   During the performances, Sean will play Ravel's Piano Concerto in G.
Soprano Franceschi will sing "Chi il bel sogno di Doretta" from Puccini's
"La Rondine" and "O, mio babbino caro" from Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi."
Laurel will play Vivaldi's Piccolo Concerto in C.</TE>
<TE>   Other featured soloists include 13-year-old pianist Sherman Ng of
Westlake Village, 21-year-old pianist Karine Poghosyan of Northridge,
13-year-old pianist Katrina Bobbs of Granada Hills and 17-year-old
clarinetist Richard Stone of Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The performances kick off a weeklong educational program, highlighted
by eight Symphonic Adventures concerts in Thousand Oaks and Oxnard for
county schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>FYI</TE>
<TE>   The concerts will take place at 7:30 p.m. today at the Oxnard
Performing Arts Center, 800 Hobson Way, and at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza's Fred Kavli Theater, 2100 Thousand Oaks
Blvd. Tickets are priced from $8 to $19 at both venues and are available
by phone today from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at (800) New-West and at

<HD>Backers of College Bond Measure Start Recruiting Support</HD>
<DH>Vote: The $365-million initiative on the March ballot would pay for
projects such as new classrooms and a training academy for firefighters
and officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New classrooms, computer labs and a training academy for
firefighters and law enforcement officers are among the projects that
would be funded by a $365-million ballot initiative sponsored by the
Ventura County Community College District.</LD>
<LD>   With less than two months to the election, college administrators,
students and other bond supporters are aggressively campaigning for
Measure S. The initiative, which would finance a host of construction and
repair projects at the district's three campuses, will appear on the
March 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the commitments we have made publicly is, if this bond passes,
it will fix the needs of this district's facilities for the next 50
years," Chancellor Phillip Westin said. "This is a one-time deal."</LD>
<TE>   Westin and Deputy Chancellor Michael Gregoryk have been making
presentations to civic groups, seeking out endorsements from elected
officials and raising the estimated $250,000 needed to fund the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge project because the time frame is short and we have a lot
of work to do," Westin said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, students have launched a voter registration drive on the
three college campuses, and a "Yes on S" Web site has been set up.</TE>
<TE>   Positive reaction from a public opinion poll and a desire to avoid
competing with other state bond measures in the November general election
convinced college officials that it was better to take their chances on
the March ballot, said Pat Kistler, a district spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   If the measure is approved by voters, property owners will see their
yearly tax bills rise $18.97 for every $100,000 of assessed value, an
increase of $66 for the owners of a $350,000 home.</TE>
<TE>   No groups or individuals submitted written arguments opposing Measure
S in time to appear on the sample ballots that will be mailed to
registered voters, Westin said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters include a cross-section of nonpartisan officeholders,
including Supervisor Kathy Long, Sheriff Bob Brooks, Oxnard Mayor Manuel
Lopez, Ventura Mayor Ray Di Guilio and state Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San
Luis Obispo). Richard Rush, president of Cal State University Channel
Islands, added his name to the list of supporters this week.</TE>
<TE>   The bond campaign has secured pledges totaling $102,000, or about 40%
of the amount backers say is needed for signs, mailings and television,
radio and newspaper ads.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the campaign funding is expected to come from vendors who do
business with the colleges and the county's construction industry,
including architects, engineers and contractors who would have a vested
interest in the measure's success, according to Gregoryk.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the $356 million raised through bond sales would be divided
among Ventura, Moorpark and Oxnard colleges during the next decade and
would be used for projects designated by college trustees.</TE>
<TE>   These would include adding classrooms, lecture halls, computer labs,
day-care centers and science facilities to keep up with rising
enrollments; replacing outmoded wiring, plumbing and electrical systems;
and renovating gymnasiums, libraries, athletic fields and auditoriums.</TE>
<TE>   The single largest project would involve building and equipping a new
regional training academy for county firefighters, sheriff's deputies and
police officers at an estimated cost of $24 million. The facility would
be constructed at Las Posas and Pleasant Valley roads in Camarillo behind
a fire station.</TE>
<TE>   While it is not unusual for a local bond measure to receive the 55% of
the vote needed to pass, "it's not a slam dunk," said Catherine Lew, the
community college district's campaign consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign team will use mailings and a volunteer phone bank to
target the 50,000 voters who submitted absentee ballots during the last
March election.</TE>

<HD>UC Tuition Break OKd for Some Immigrants</HD>
<DH>Education: Undocumented students would pay resident rate. Change
hinges on liability protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES EDUCATION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a vote closely watched by advocates for immigrant rights,
University of California regents voted Thursday to allow undocumented
immigrants with proven California ties to pay the same tuition as other
California residents.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-5 vote was contingent on the state Legislature helping to
shield UC from liability if legal challenges arise.</LD>
<LD>   The decision would bring the university in line with a new state law
that allows such students to pay the lower in-state fees at the Cal State
system and the state's community colleges. UC policy is not controlled
directly by Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   The decision by UC, the state's most prestigious public university
system, was considered especially symbolic. Supporters said the vote,
together with the law (AB 540) that prompted it, marked a milestone in
the state's political shift toward granting rights to undocumented
immigrants after a more hostile era in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new policy, immigrant students who have lived in California
for at least three years, are California high school graduates and have
applied for legal status would be eligible for the much lower in-state
tuition. In-state students now pay an average of $3,859 while
out-of-state and international students pay an average of $14,933, UC
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Also eligible for the lower tuition would be non-immigrant students
from out of state who have lived in California at least three years and
graduated from high schools in the state.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said 300 to 400 students now enrolled at the university's
eight undergraduate campuses would be eligible for the tuition savings,
with fewer than half of those undocumented. Based on those figures, the
cost of the change is estimated at $3 million to $4 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   University officials said they could not predict how many students
ultimately might be affected by the new policy, noting that many who
might not previously have applied might now do so.</TE>
<TE>   Several experts noted the significance of the state's political shift
since 1994, when voters approved Proposition 187, which sought to deny
education in California public schools to undocumented children. Much of
the measure was thrown out by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incredible change, the result of demographic and political
change in the state, along with a new dose of common sense," said Mark
Silverman, director of immigrant policy for an immigrant legal resources
center in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Young, undocumented immigrants and supporters urged regents to approve
the new policy and later celebrated the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Gwen Corona, 20, a high school graduate who works as an ambulance
dispatcher in Bakersfield, said she had dreamed of attending a UC school
but did not apply despite a 3.8 high school GPA and good test scores; it
was out of reach financially, she said. She did apply and was accepted to
Cal State Bakersfield but did not enroll because she could not afford the
out-of-state fees there either.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking of myself but also other kids in my situation," said
Corona, who supports her disabled mother and three younger sisters. "If
we don't have the opportunity for education, we'll just be reliving our
parents' situations."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the undocumented students, about 56%, are from Asian
nations, with Latinos representing about 12% and other ethnicities the
remainder, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The regents made their approval contingent on the Legislature passing
an amendment to the Cal State and community college bill, aimed at
limiting UC's liability in case of lawsuits by out-of-state students not
eligible for the tuition break. That amendment was introduced Thursday,
said an aide to Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles), the bill's
sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Torres, Firebaugh's legislative director who attended the
meeting, said the amendment appeared to have strong bipartisan support
and if passed and signed by the governor, could take effect in time to
allow next fall's freshman class to pay the lower costs.</TE>
<TE>   Several regents who voted against the change, including Board of
Regents Chairwoman Sue Johnson, said they were concerned about liability.
But some also had philosophical differences with the idea of extending
the tuition benefit to undocumented immigrants while denying it to U.S.
citizens who live out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Regent Ward Connerly said he sympathized with the plight of students
brought to the United States by their parents who sought to attend UC.
But he said he voted against the measure because he did not consider
three years of residency a sufficient period to justify the tuition
break. "I feel we've really got to take care of Americans first and
Californians first," he said.</TE>
<TE>   UC General Counsel James Holst said this would not be the first time
that undocumented immigrants have been allowed to pay the lower tuition.
After a 1985 court ruling, the university was required for five years to
give such students the in-state tuition. That policy ended after a court
appeal reversed the earlier decision.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the regents, as expected, gave final approval to
development plans and other items that will allow the university to
proceed with its plans to build a new campus near Merced. Largely without
discussion, the regents certified an environmental impact report and
initial construction plans for the 2000-acre campus.</TE>

<HD>Hahn to Seek U.S. Grants for LAX</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The decision reverses the policy of his predecessor,
Riordan, who could not apply for the money because he was diverting
airport revenues to the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Abandoning a controversial policy that cost Los Angeles millions
during the Riordan administration, Mayor James K. Hahn announced Thursday
the city will seek more than $50 million in federal grants to increase
security and make major improvements at Los Angeles International
Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn directed the head of the city's airport department to apply for
"all of the outstanding airport improvement grants that have not been
received."</LD>
<LD>   The Times reported last month that the city passed up or did not apply
for more than $117 million in federal airport grants because of the
policy of then-Mayor Richard Riordan to divert airport revenues to pay
for more Los Angeles police officers. To receive the federal grants,
cities cannot divert airport revenues for other uses.</LD>
<TE>   For eight years, the city passed up federal funds that could have been
used to tighten security in passenger terminals, soundproof hundreds of
homes against aircraft noise, and make safety improvements to avoid
near-misses between airplanes at the world's third-busiest airport.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's decision to change course and again seek federal grants has
implications for the airport, airlines, passengers and residents who live
near the airport. Federal funds are considered essential if the airport
is to meet tougher security standards, upgrade, modernize and expand its
aging facilities, and address safety problems on runways and taxiways.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the federal money is badly needed to address the financial
crisis and security concerns at the airport that were sparked by the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The steep decline in airline passenger
traffic has slashed airport revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger traffic at LAX was down 7.5% from last January through
November, as compared to the year before. In November alone, passenger
traffic dropped by 25%.</TE>
<TE>   And sharply higher security costs have plunged the airport into its
worst financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The pressing security costs made a change in the Riordan policy
essential, Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We figure that $15 million has been spent by our Department of
Airports on increased security costs since Sept. 11," Hahn said. "So
we'll be asking for as much as we can get. Because the dynamics certainly
have changed for the airport's financial picture since Sept. 11, there
really was no choice" but to accept the Airport Improvement Program
grants.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said Congress made the grant program "the only way you can be
reimbursed" for security expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Today is the deadline for airports to apply for reimbursement of
federally mandated security costs incurred since the hijacking of four
jetliners on Sept. 11. Three of those jets were bound for Los Angeles but
were commandeered for attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
The fourth jetliner crashed in Pennsylvania after an apparent struggle on
board.</TE>
<TE>   After the attacks, Congress passed and President Bush signed
legislation tightening security at the nation's airports, federalizing
security screeners, and imposing new requirements for inspection of
passengers and baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Congress appropriated $175 million in supplemental airport grant funds
to pay for expenses such as added police and security personnel. Though
the federal money is not large enough to reimburse every airport, Hahn
said, he expects Los Angeles to get a substantial amount.</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Kennard, executive director of the city agency that operates
LAX, said the airport will ask for $11 million from the federal fund to
reimburse airports for security-related costs. About $8 million of that
amount represents the cost for Los Angeles and airport police officers
whose presence at LAX was significantly increased after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>Retroactive Funds Sought</TE>
<TE>   Kennard said the policy reversal also will allow airport officials to
retroactively seek three years worth of federal grants--or about $43
million. The airport agency would use the money to repay itself for the
extension of one of the airport taxiways over the Sepulveda Boulevard
tunnel--a project that is already complete.</TE>
<TE>   The airport also would qualify for at least $12 million a year in
federal grants in the future, Kennard said. The airport plans to use that
money to reconfigure the airport's aging terminals to accommodate new
baggage and passenger screening equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The airport agency also will consider raising the fee charged each
passenger originating at the airport from $3 per ticket to $4.50 a
ticket, she said. The so-called passenger facility fee could be used to
help finance construction projects and security improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Riordan, Hahn made clear that he is not interested in diverting
revenue from LAX to pay for other city services. "I'm interested in
having the airport be on financially stable ground," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Airport Commission, which he appoints, will be asked to
officially change the policy at an upcoming meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Airline industry representatives applauded Hahn's decision to accept
federal grants. The airline industry waged a long effort in the courts
and Congress to block Riordan's efforts to transfer money from the
airport to City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very positive step," said Ed Merlis, senior vice
president for legislative and international affairs at the Air Transport
Assn. in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good news," said Alan Wayne, a United Airlines spokesman in
Los Angeles. "This is the right thing for the city to do. This is good
for the airport, good for our collective customers, and good for the
tenants to see that every available resource is being used to improve the
overall capabilities of this airport."</TE>
<TE>Focusing on Construction</TE>
<TE>   Carriers said the move will free up resources and allow the city
agency that operates LAX and its tenants to focus on construction
projects put on hold after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Either the city or the airlines' ability to finance these types of
projects is limited," said Frank A. Clark, executive director of a
nonprofit corporation that represents the 34 international carriers that
operate at the Tom Bradley International Terminal. "As far as the
international carriers are concerned, the Bradley [terminal] is 18 years
old and it needs to be evaluated and refurbished and brought up to the
current technologies."</TE>
<TE>   Clark added that Hahn's decision to overturn his predecessor's policy
will play an important role as the mayor's plans to modernize the airport
take shape.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said the city needs federal funds to
help pay for the airport's remodeling.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of focusing on expanding the airport as Riordan did, Hahn has
shifted the emphasis to making it safer. The mayor is developing a new
approach that calls for building a new passenger and baggage screening
facility near the San Diego Freeway. Passengers would be transported from
the new complex to passenger terminals on a people-mover system.</TE>

<HD>11-Vehicle Pileup in Bell Leaves 1 Dead, 9 Hurt</HD>
<DH>Accident: Big rig smashes through freeway median. Thousands of
commuters are caught in gridlock.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A big rig driver lost control of his truck on the Long Beach
Freeway on Thursday morning, punching through a median barrier into
oncoming traffic and causing a chain-reaction collision that killed a
judge and injured nine other people.</LD>
<LD>   The accident near Bandini Boulevard in the city of Bell involved nine
cars and one other truck. Thousands of commuters on freeways and side
streets in every direction were affected.</LD>
<LD>   The mangled mess of cars and twisted guardrail provided grim evidence
of the dangers of one of the region's most heavily traveled truck routes.</LD>
<TE>   A $400-million effort was launched last year to repave a 24-mile
stretch of the freeway and install a reinforced concrete barrier in place
of the light metal guardrail the 18-wheeler shredded.</TE>
<TE>   But the work is not expected to be completed until 2007. And it is
unclear whether a reinforced barrier would have prevented Thursday's
crash.</TE>
<TE>   The accident began on the northbound freeway near the Bandini exit at
6:15 a.m. when the driver of a furniture-laden tractor-trailer swerved to
avoid a white Mustang that was weaving erratically in front of the truck,
said California Highway Patrol Officer Jesse Cazares.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified truck driver, who was in the third lane from the
median, veered left and lost control, tearing through the freeway divider
and into oncoming traffic, Cazares said.</TE>
<TE>   The truck slammed into a southbound white Suburban, driven by Los
Angeles County Superior Court Commissioner Jeffrey Marckese, 45, of
Burbank, who died instantly.</TE>
<TE>   Marckese, a family law attorney, had been appointed to the bench in
Compton two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Six other motorists were hurt, including Robert Dove, 55, who was
critically injured while driving to his South Gate office from his
Alhambra home.</TE>
<TE>   Dove has worked 32 years for Los Angeles County, and is a supervising
inspector for the Weights and Measures Bureau of the Los Angeles County
Agricultural Commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other injured were: a 38-year-old man, a truck driver who
was in guarded condition at County-USC Medical Center with a head injury;
a 55-year-old man, treated for a fractured leg at St. Francis Medical
Center in Lynwood; and four others treated for minor injuries at Downey
Community Hospital, whom a hospital spokesperson declined to identify.</TE>
<TE>   CHP investigators are investigating the accident, and ask eyewitnesses
to contact them.</TE>
<TE>   The northbound section of the freeway was reopened about four hours
after the crash, at 10 a.m., but the southbound lanes remained closed
until the early evening while investigators did their work.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting traffic congestion spilled over onto the San Gabriel
River and Santa Ana freeways, as well as streets throughout southeast Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Like thousands of other motorists stuck on the crawling Long Beach
Freeway, Cliff Smith had to exhibit more patience than usual when his
regular 30-minute drive to Bell stretched to two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's port director at Long
Beach, said that when he saw the number of firetrucks, police units and
tow trucks passing on the shoulder, he knew he was in for a long wait.</TE>
<TE>   "When the reports indicated the magnitude of the accident, you realize
it's going to take as long as it's going to take," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>A Need for a Backup Route</TE>
<TE>   Others who work in the area learned a valuable lesson: Always be ready
with a backup route.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us don't know the detours on the side streets," said Traci
Fang, an employee at Robinson's Flowers on Eastern Avenue in Bell. "We
only know one way."</TE>
<TE>   It usually takes her eight minutes to get from the Bandini Boulevard
exit to the shop. On Thursday her commute took an hour and 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Kelly, 51, an administrative aide in the Long Beach city
auditor's office, said several people in her office were caught up in the
crash fallout, even those who didn't use the Long Beach Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "It affected me on the PCH," Kelly said. Her typical 20-minute drive
from Huntington Beach became a 40-minute trek.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly said most people in her office know not to take the freeway
because of routine gridlock during rush hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people avoid it," she said. "It's pretty direct, but you really
think twice before going on it."</TE>
<TE>   The reason for such hesitation is that the freeway is a major route
for big rigs carrying cargo from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
to inland distribution centers. It carries an average of 200,000 vehicles
a day, including 22,600 trucks, which are 11% of the daily traffic. The
freeway was designed in the 1950s to carry only half that much truck
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   That volume is expected to increase because of projections that truck
traffic from the ports will triple in the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a situation that, frankly, we are only anticipating will worsen
in time," said Ray Maekawa, director of highway programs at the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. That agency is studying ways to
improve traffic flow and safety along the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The $3.7-million study was launched last year and is expected to be
completed in June 2003. Maekawa said the report will look at several
ideas for accommodating the increasing truck traffic, including the
construction of elevated truck lanes.</TE>
<TE>Freeway's First Major Overhaul</TE>
<TE>   The relentless daily pounding of 800,000-pound big rigs has taken its
toll on the aging freeway. Last year, the state Department of
Transportation launched the freeway's first major overhaul, a
$400-million plan to repave the stretch from Pacific Coast Highway in
Long Beach to the San Bernardino Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the project, Caltrans is replacing the metal-and-wood
median barrier along the entire 24.5-mile length of the freeway with a
concrete-and-metal reinforced barrier, as required under state
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase of the massive project, a 2.5-mile stretch between
Pacific Coast Highway and the San Diego Freeway, began in March and is
expected to be completed next year.</TE>
<TE>   The 3 1/2-foot-tall concrete barriers, fluted at the bottom, are
standard on newer California freeways. They are considered stronger and a
safer alternatives to metal barriers such as those on the Long Beach
Freeway that are bolted to wooden posts.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Mellen, a traffic engineer for the Automobile Club of Southern
California, said studies show that concrete barriers "significantly
reduce the number of head-on collisions" by preventing traffic from
breaking through into oncoming traffic.</TE>
<TE>   He said the so-called "Jersey barriers" are designed to deflect cars
back into their own lane. But Mellen said he does not know how effective
the concrete barriers are with big trucks.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Cooley Fires Up an Ice-Cold Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So why now?</LD>
<LD>   Why is it that in 2002, 27 years after a murder and bank robbery near
Sacramento, authorities have finally decided to prosecute former members
of the Symbionese Liberation Army?</LD>
<LD>   Here's why:</LD>
<TE>   About a year and a half ago, Riverside doctor Jon Opsahl began getting
calls from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators told him that while trying to make a case against Sara
Jane Olson for trying to blow up police cars in Los Angeles, they had
made two startling discoveries while nosing through ice-cold evidence
files in Sacramento and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   First, that an even stronger case could be made against Olson and the
SLA for allegedly murdering Opsahl's mother during the 1975 bank robbery
in Carmichael. (New forensic techniques had helped nail down a link
between lead pellets and a shotgun found in an SLA hide-out.)</TE>
<TE>   And second, that Sacramento authorities didn't seem interested in
getting off their duffs and rounding up the killers.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office "told me the better
case was in Sacramento," Opsahl remembers. "Evidence was being ignored,
justice was being denied, and it wasn't right."</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl says he wasn't exactly pushed by L.A. County D.A. Steve Cooley
and his investigators, but their message was clear. If Opsahl raised a
stink in Sacramento, the D.A.'s office there might be embarrassed into
doing its job.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew I'd be upset and make some noise about seeing justice
served," says Opsahl, who was 15 when his mother was killed by a shotgun
blast while making a bank deposit for her church group.</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl willingly turned up the heat, assembling a raft of evidence on
a Web site in his mother's name, granting interviews, and grilling the
Sacramento D.A.'s office for falling down on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Sacramento D.A. didn't do anything," Opsahl says, "it sounded
like Cooley was going to stick his neck out and try to file from outside
the jurisdiction where the crime took place."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't happen much, and it might have been more of a threat than
a promise. But there is legal precedent.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley was unavailable Thursday, at least on this subject. But one law
enforcement source said Opsahl's version of events is on the money.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know to what extent, if any, I might be giving Cooley more
credit than he deserves. But clearly, his gang did some nifty work in
this case, and he's keeping his head down now because relations with
Sacto D.A. Jan Scully are colder than Truckee in January.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased they're prosecuting the case and wish them well,"
is all Cooley flack Sandi Gibbons would say.</TE>
<TE>   Scully's office, on the other hand, has nothing to say. I left a
half-dozen messages up there a month ago, asking whether they might
reopen the Carmichael bank robbery case, but they didn't return a single
one. "No comment," was all they had to say when I called on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose I can understand the policy. If, as it appears, another
agency is showing Sacramento prosecutors how to do a job on their own
turf, now is not the time to come out of the hole they've been
hibernating in.</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of doing their work for them, Olson's guilty plea in Los
Angeles, and today's scheduled sentencing, is a jackpot for Sacramento.
It has to be more than coincidence that when Olson pleaded guilty here,
Sacramento prosecutors finally found their courage.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the jury finds out she conspired to blow up police cars in L.A.,
she's toast," says former Los Angeles prosecutor Mark Werksman. And given
Olson's admissions about funding SLA activities, the whole crew could go
down with her.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys will fight to the death to make Olson's attempted
car-bombing admission inadmissible in the murder trial. But how can they
possibly succeed, given the web this gang has weaved?</TE>
<TE>   You can be sure prosecutors will argue that the gang knocked off the
bank to finance a field trip to Los Angeles for the sake of blowing cop
cars to smithereens. And should the jury doubt such a scenario,
prosecutors will point to Sara Jane.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be devastating," says Werksman.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, despite claims of innocence in the bank robbery, has to see it
coming.</TE>
<TE>   Can she save herself?</TE>
<TE>   Let's put it this way: She won't be on stage in the fall lineup of her
community theater group in St. Paul, Minn. She's already looking at a
minimum of five years behind bars for the attempted car bombing.</TE>
<TE>   But she can try to put a positive spin on the fact that she pleaded
guilty in the attempted car bombing. Then she can rat out her friends,
including alleged shooter Emily Harris, in return for concurrent
sentences and a lesser charge than first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether Olson tries to negotiate, Werksman says a
27-year delay between the crime and the trial will work to the advantage
of prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got all the cards in their hands, and the defense has to play
catch-up," he says. Then there's the possibility that at the last
possible minute, a prosecutor will miraculously discover a devastating
piece of evidence in a dusty file.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Opsahl doesn't dwell on the details just yet. He appreciates
Cooley's efforts, and he supports the Sacramento D.A.'s prosecution, even
if the latter was slow on the take.</TE>
<TE>   Just so long as the job gets done.</TE>

<HD>Antonovich to Postpone Supervisors' Decision on Newhall Ranch</HD>
<DH>Planning: Another legal tangle over the water supply for the
massive development triggers another delay. Opponents applaud the board
member's action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest development in Los Angeles County history--already
stalled for 20 months by a judge who questioned its water supply
projections--has been swept off course again by another legal tussle over
water.</LD>
<LD>   Newhall Ranch, a proposed 21,600-home subdivision in the fast-growing
Santa Clarita Valley, was scheduled for action next week by the county
Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   But Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, said Thursday
he will ask to delay the board decision for at least three months until
courts resolve water rights in a valley whose population is expected to
at least double during the next two decades.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to ensure that there is sufficient water for the residents of
the Santa Clarita Valley before any project is approved," Antonovich said
in a brief statement.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Newhall Ranch said they were pleased by his decision.
Ventura County Supervisor Kathy Long applauded his "leadership and due
diligence."</TE>
<TE>   "They should take another look at it," she said, adding that Ventura
County still disputes Newhall's latest analysis of water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The delay underscores California's growing recognition of the need to
tie suburban growth to water availability. Newhall Ranch has played a key
role in the evolving debate as it reverberated from the farms of Kern
County to the corridors of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich was reacting to a court decision last week that could
jeopardize water supplies for the Castaic Lake Water Agency, a wholesaler
that serves the Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   At issue are rights to 41,000 acre-feet of water a year from the Kern
County Water Agency to Castaic.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich decided that because that source of the Newhall Ranch water
has been thrown in doubt, the supervisors should delay action on the
environmental impact report for the development.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. proposes to use only a small
portion of that water for its Newhall Ranch development, about 1,600
acre-feet annually, Los Angeles County officials said Thursday they want
to make sure the Castaic agency's rights are clear.</TE>
<TE>   "The status of water in the Santa Clarita Valley is unclear,"
Antonovich deputy Conal McNamara said. "The board is not in a position to
make any kind of a decision [on Newhall Ranch]."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County supervisors unanimously approved Newhall Ranch in
late 1998, over the objections of Ventura County and several
environmental groups, which challenged the action in court.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, Kern County Superior Court Judge Roger D. Randall blocked
construction of the 12,000-acre development on the banks of the Santa
Clara River until Newhall Land could prove it had enough water to supply
the new community.</TE>
<TE>   Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman for Newhall Land, said Thursday that the
developer has since conducted more than 30 studies and cut deals to buy
and store enough water to meet nearly twice the expected demand of 70,000
residents.</TE>
<TE>   The water wars and other environmental challenges to Newhall Ranch
have knocked the project years off schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Construction, once scheduled to start in late 2000, may now be delayed
beyond 2004, Lauffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Lauffer said the most recent court decision "will have minimal, if
any, effect on Newhall Ranch's water supply." The suburb is expected to
need 17,600 acre-feet per year, less than 10% of which would come from
the Castaic Lake transfer.</TE>
<TE>   The Castaic Lake Water Agency now needs 68,000 acre-feet yearly to
serve its customers, spokeswoman Mary Lou Cotton said.</TE>
<TE>   About 36,000 acre-feet comes from State Water Project entitlements,
and the rest is obtained from local ground water. One acre-foot equals
326,000 gallons, enough to supply two families for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the agency has rights to 95,200 acre-feet annually from
the state, including the Kern County transfer, Cotton said.</TE>
<TE>   But critics, noting that the state often cannot deliver the full
amount promised, say much of the supply consists of "paper water" rather
than the wet kind.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy that they are taking this court decision seriously,"
said Lynne Plambeck, president of the citizens group Santa Clarita
Organization for Planning and the Environment.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Union Says Poll Shows Vast Majority Oppose Parks</HD>
<DH>Police: Among officers who responded, 93% voted 'no confidence' in
the chief, who is expected to seek a second term.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the Los Angeles Police Protective League said Thursday
that 93% of its members who responded to a poll said they have no
confidence in Chief Bernard C. Parks.</LD>
<LD>   The union said that two-thirds of the 8,100 members mailed ballots
voted in the poll and that the results were tabulated by an independent
firm.</LD>
<LD>   The no-confidence vote was the latest in a series of steps the league
has taken to publicize its dissatisfaction with the chief. League
President Mitzi Grasso has been calling for Parks' removal since late
last year.</LD>
<TE>   Parks is nearing the end of his first five-year term and can be
reappointed for one more term. He is expected to formally submit his
request for reappointment in early February.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, who appoints the Police Commission
which will play a key role in determining Parks' fate, has said the
decision will be based on the chief's performance, not political
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   As the decision draws near, more interest groups are taking sides. For
example, in a statement released last week and reiterated at a press
conference Wednesday, the Oscar Joel Bryant Foundation, which represents
black LAPD officers, defended Parks and sharply criticized the police
union.</TE>
<TE>   The Bryant Foundation accused the union of being "determined to turn
back the clock to the days of [former LAPD Police Chief] Daryl Gates,
when the cowboy mentality dominated."</TE>
<TE>   The union is at odds with Parks over, among other things, his
far-reaching changes in the department's disciplinary structure, which
have resulted in many more officers being investigated for alleged
misconduct than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Thursday, Grasso accused the chief of failed
leadership. "With this 'no confidence' vote, the police officers of Los
Angeles hope to send a signal to the Police Commission, Mayor and City
Council that Chief Parks can no longer lead the LAPD," the statement
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after, LAPD spokesman Lt. Horace Frank held a news conference
in which he described Parks, who was out of town at a conference, as
disappointed with the union's actions. Frank said the vote was divisive.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Police Commission President Rick Caruso released a
written statement in response to the union's announcement, saying the
commission would evaluate the chief on several "performance objectives"
and would decide his fate "based on the merits and not the political
influence of any one person or group."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Nate Holden and members of three community groups,
representing the city's diverse ethnicities, also spoke Thursday in
defense of the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Other City Council members also waded in:</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Zine, a former director of the police union, said
the survey confirms what he has long thought: that the officers do not
have enough confidence in the chief to warrant another term in the job.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to retire with dignity and respect," Zine said. "I respect
the years he has put in, but his management style is not working. The
officers are afraid about job security. They are afraid to do their job."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, however, called for restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is going through a very significant and at times
sensitive process over the next several months if the chief decides to
ask for another term," Weiss said. "The important thing for that process
is that cool heads prevail and for folks to focus on the issues and
ratchet down the tension rather than inflame it."</TE>

<HD>Man's Headless Body Found in Trash Bin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The headless body of a man was found stuffed in a trash bin
Thursday at a southwest Los Angeles apartment complex, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The body, which was of a black man, was jammed into a plastic trash
container in an alley in the 4000 block of Buckingham Road near Palmyra
Road. The container was one of about a dozen behind the complex.</LD>
<LD>   A resident found the body about 3:30 p.m. as he tried to move the
trash container and noticed that it was unusually heavy, said Los Angeles
Police Det. Brent Josephson of the Southwest Division.</LD>
<TE>   Police had not determined how the man was killed or how long the body
had been in the trash bin, Josephson said. About 7:30 p.m., a bloodhound
unit arrived to search for the head and to trace where the body came
from.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Ahaiwe, owner of a nearby store, said he gave police a
videotape from a camera he installed in the alley about a year ago in
response to crime around his business.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm robbed about 50 times a year," Ahaiwe said.</TE>
<TE>   The area where the body was found is known as Baldwin Village, but
some residents call it by its former name, "the Jungle." The tough
neighborhood was featured in the finale of the Denzel Washington movie
"Training Day."</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 apartment buildings and 10,000 residents share the space
at the foot of the Baldwin Hills near the Crenshaw district. The City
Council voted in 1988 to change the neighborhood's name to shed its
crime-tainted image.</TE>

<HD>Secretary of State May Take Municipal Elections Out of South Gate's
Hands</HD>
<DH>Politics: Jones visits to warn that he could turn over the town's
electoral duties to L.A. County officials if problems persist at City
Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Bill Jones, making a rare visit to South Gate,
announced an unprecedented plan Thursday to restore order to city
elections long marred by violence, intimidation and allegations of fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Jones said the state will monitor the electoral process in the
blue-collar community. If problems persist, he warned, he will force the
city to hand over election duties to the Los Angeles County
registrar-recorder's office.</LD>
<LD>   "Never before has the state been required to employ such strict
supervision of a city's election administration," said Jones, "but never
before have we seen the crisis level of problems, intimidation and loss
of voter confidence we have encountered here in South Gate."</LD>
<TE>   Jones, a Republican candidate for governor, visited in response to an
appeal from City Clerk Carmen Avalos, who was stripped of her electoral
duties by the City Council majority last month.</TE>
<TE>   Avalos, who stood at Jones' side during the news conference in front
of City Hall, was cheered by a boisterous crowd of about 80 supporters,
many of them police officers and others seeking a voter recall of the
city's leading officials.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, during his speech, said he would order South Gate officials to
provide a status report regarding the security of the recall petitions.</TE>
<TE>   He said that corruption probes by the district attorney's public
integrity squad are continuing and that federal authorities have also
taken note of South Gate's volatile situation. FBI officials would not
comment on whether they have launched a probe.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' visit drew cheers from South Gate police officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The state's involvement verifies what we've known all along:
Something stinks," said Lt. Vince Avila.</TE>
<TE>   Conspicuously absent from the event were Avalos' political opponents,
Treasurer Albert Robles and members of the City Council majority.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Raul Moriel said he had not been notified of Jones' visit. Vice
Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba dismissed the event as a political ploy by
Avalos. She claims Avalos is inept and biased.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect the secretary of state, but he should leave local issues to
us," Ruvalcaba said.</TE>
<TE>   Avalos has been battling for control of the clerk's office ever since
she defeated Ruvalcaba's sister in elections last year. The council has
slashed Avalos' salary and staffing and taken away many of her normal
duties, such as supervising elections.</TE>
<TE>   When voter recall drives were launched last year against every elected
official, including Avalos, the council replaced Avalos with an interim
clerk, Julia Sylva, an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents are questioning whether Sylva can be impartial,
since county prosecutors said that she once represented two of Robles'
allies who have been charged with electoral fraud. Sylva denies that she
represented the pair, saying she accompanied them to a meeting with
prosecutors as a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sylva's involvement in the case came as a surprise to Moriel,
who originally supported her appointment. "That makes me have second
thoughts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's politics have long been racked by turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the business of a recall organizer was firebombed, an
unsolved crime that police suspect was politically motivated. And in
1999, then-Mayor Henry Gonzalez was shot in the head after a council
meeting in a crime that has never been solved. Gonzalez was slightly
injured. Now a city councilman and an ally of Avalos, Gonzalez is also
the target of a recall drive.</TE>

<HD>Garamendi Challenges Opponent on Backing</HD>
<DH>Election: On a campaign stop in Sherman Oaks, the insurance
commissioner candidate criticizes Calderon for accepting contributions
from the industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eighth anniversary of the Northridge earthquake, state
insurance commissioner candidate John Garamendi on Thursday visited a
Sherman Oaks apartment complex still in need of repairs and criticized an
opponent for taking campaign money from insurance companies.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Thomas Calderon's acceptance of campaign contributions
from insurance companies could create a conflict of interest, as it did
for ousted Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, Garamendi said.</LD>
<LD>   "He is headed down that path, taking money from the insurance
companies, and then he'll dance to their tune if he's ever elected,"
Garamendi said. "The voters just can't have that happen."</LD>
<TE>   Calderon, a Democrat from Montebello who chairs the Assembly Insurance
Committee, responded that he can stand up to the insurance industry. He
cited a bill he is sponsoring, AB5, which would prevent companies from
using credit records to set rates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only a problem if you don't know how to say 'no' to the
insurance companies," Calderon said.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi, who served as insurance commissioner from 1991 to 1995,
said he and another Democratic candidate in the March 5 primary, former
Orange County Assemblyman Tom Umberg, will not accept campaign
contributions from insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi on Thursday visited the Horace Heidt Estates, where $2
million to $4 million in repairs for earthquake damage remains to be
completed, according to the owner's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for a lawsuit filed in November against Farmers
Insurance, engineers inspected the 10-acre complex of 159 apartments, 18
homes and a subterranean garage. The damage they found includes a large
crack in the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Although some repairs have been made, Horace Heidt, who owns the
complex built by his father in the 1950s, said the insurance adjusters
didn't look hard enough to find damage. "These are hidden things the
experts are supposed to know," Heidt said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Farmers Insurance declined to comment on the
lawsuit. Attorney Brian Heffernan estimates that it was one of about
1,000 filed in Southern California before the Dec. 31 deadline to reopen
claims stemming from the 1994 quake.</TE>

<HD>City Places Lifesaving Devices at Public Sites</HD>
<DH>Health: The first of 200 defibrillators are installed to provide
emergency aid to heart attack victims. LAX will have 50 of the units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles has placed the first 30 of a planned 200 defibrillators
in public places such as the zoo and the convention center in what
officials call the nation's most extensive municipal program yet to save
the lives of people having heart attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Although every city firetruck and ambulance has been equipped with
defibrillators for more than a decade, the new city program will make the
devices more accessible than ever before.</LD>
<LD>   Marc Eckstein, medical director of the Los Angeles Fire Department,
who is in charge of the program, said Thursday that by summer the city
will have given 100 employees four hours of training in the use of the
defibrillators and CPR techniques. The program will cost $700,000 for the
first year, including training, installation and the defibrillators,
which typically retail for $3,000.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually, Eckstein hopes Los Angeles will have 1,000 devices in
place and have trained 40,000 city employees in their use.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein said that many of the defibrillators will be placed in glass
installations like fire extinguishers, and that in some cases untrained
people have used them successfully to jolt a person's heart back into a
normal rhythm. As soon as they are turned on, the devices play recorded
instructions on their use.</TE>
<TE>   But training is preferable, the medical director said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Eckstein said, time is of the essence in the use of
defibrillators. For every minute that elapses after a person has entered
into sudden cardiac arrest before the device is used, "the chance of
survival goes down about 10%," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein said plans call for 50 defibrillators at Los Angeles
International Airport in the next two months. Some are already in place.</TE>

<HD>Man Pleads Not Guilty in Hair-Cutting Attacks</HD>
<DH>Courts: If convicted of second-degree robbery and other counts, he
faces 18 years in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Norwalk man who allegedly attacked women and cut their hair with
a knife or scissors pleaded not guilty Thursday to robbery and assault
charges.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Lynn Howard, 47, faces nine counts of second-degree robbery,
one count of a lewd act on a child and one count of assault on a police
officer, said Long Beach Deputy Dist. Atty. Laurie Trammell.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted, Howard faces a maximum sentence of 18 years and four
months in prison, Trammell said.</LD>
<TE>   Howard appeared unshaven and weary as he whispered "not guilty" during
his arraignment before Long Beach Superior Court Judge Patrick D. Madden.</TE>
<TE>   He remained in custody with bail set at $500,000. He is scheduled to
return to court Jan. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Howard's brother Jack, a Los Angeles County probation officer, has
described his brother as a family man and bicycle shop owner who had
never been in trouble with the law.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Michael Howard attacked women and one young girl in the
Long Beach area and East Los Angeles in the last two weeks of December.
He is accused of grabbing them from behind as they sat or walked along
major streets, then cutting their hair with scissors or a knife.</TE>
<TE>   On New Year's Eve, a sheriff's deputy saw Howard as he allegedly used
a chokehold on a woman at a pay phone in East Los Angeles. The deputy
chased Howard, who climbed into a nearby car and tried to run him down,
authorities said. The deputy responded by firing several shots, but
Howard drove away, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested Howard Jan. 2 at an apartment building on Pine Avenue
in Long Beach, where he had gone to see a friend.</TE>

royalties from Vivendi Universal is Peggy Lee. One of her hits, of

<LD>   No slowing down: And some people can't bother to stop for stop signs,
as the flattened one found by Alan Frisbie illustrates (see
accompanying). Norma Kleiner noticed that an anonymous resident went so
far as to attach a plea to a sign in Westport, Conn. Larry Stirling,
meanwhile, came upon a cowboy version in Miles City, Mont.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the answer is more signs at the same corner, such as the group
snapped by Katie Shiban. Alas, they were actually in the back of a truck
advertising an airline that had "pulled out all the stops."</LD>
<TE>   All chocolate, all the time: The Next Stage offers such unusual bus
expeditions as the Aroma Tour (citrus goods in the Produce Market and
other "good smells" around the Southland), the Insomniacs Tour (an
all-night jaunt) and Chocolate-Covered L.A. (stops at factories and
restaurants that make the candies).</TE>
<TE>   Of the Chocolate Tour, which includes See's candy served on the tour
bus, owner Marlene Gordon said: "It could be a good last hurrah before
joining a gym."</TE>
<TE>   Even Gordon can't predict all the sights, especially on the Insomniacs
Tour (price: $35).</TE>
<TE>   There was the man on Olive Street who was hanging from a lamp post and
threatening to jump--though he was just a few feet off the ground. A nude
jogger, with only a towel around his neck, ran out of his way to greet
one tour bus on 9th Street. "I guess he was a true exhibitionist," Gordon
said.</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion, she was serving refreshments to her customers at
Union Station when a street person got in line.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving a bagel and coffee, he told Gordon: "I sure do thank
you, ma'am. I had no idea Union Mission was serving in Union Station."</TE>
<TE>   Pioneer Valley businesses: In the new book "Movie Love in the '50s,"
author James Harvey writes that the late director Douglas Sirk
("Imitation of Life" and others) said his "happiest time in Hollywood"

<TE>   "He and Mrs. Sirk (mostly Mrs. Sirk, he emphasized) ran first a
chicken farm and then--when the chickens at last defeated them--an
alfalfa farm," Harvey writes.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if any of those victorious birds were related to the infamous

<HD>Woman Sentenced in Breeding Case Linked to Killer Dog</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Lennox resident, who raised puppies related to a
mastiff that killed a San Francisco woman, is fined and put on three
years' probation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lennox woman who raised puppies related to a mastiff that fatally
mauled a San Francisco woman has averted a criminal trial by pleading no
contest to breeding dogs without a license and other violations.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say Carolyn Murphy knows the owners of the dogs in the San
Francisco case, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, and may have been part
of an alleged dog breeding ring controlled from Pelican Bay State Prison.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy, 52, who changed her not guilty plea in Los Angeles Superior
Court on Monday, pleaded no contest to breeding dogs and running a kennel
without a license, and having unlicensed animals under her control
without providing rabies vaccinations for them.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Kenji Machida sentenced Murphy to three years
probation and ordered her to pay more than $1,000 in fines. If she had
been convicted, Murphy could have faced up to 18 months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Animal control officials ordered her to give away six of the dogs and
get vaccinations and licenses for her other dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy is scheduled as a defense witness in the upcoming trial of the
dog owners from San Francisco, which has been moved to Los Angeles
because of publicity in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Lacrosse coach Diane Whipple was attacked early last year by Bane, a
Presa Canario-English mastiff mix, and a Presa Canario named Hera in the
hall of her apartment building as she scrambled to unlock her door.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Murphy ran advertisements in newspapers and on the Internet
offering to sell seven of Bane's descendants, pups with names such as
Goliath, Scarface, Bonnie and Clyde.</TE>
<TE>   After the ads ran, animal control officials went to Murphy's home,
where they discovered a suspected illegal breeding and kennel operation.
Prosecutors investigated and filed charges against Murphy on Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Here was this woman trying to profit from another woman's death,"
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Houle. "It was kind of sickening."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Murphy has a son who is an inmate at Pelican Bay with
Knoller's and Noel's adopted son. In addition, photographs of Murphy and
her dogs were found in the apartment where Knoller and Noel lived,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Anton Plese said his client had a litter that she was
trying to get rid of but was never breeding dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's politically motivated," Plese said. "The only reason they are
doing this is because of the tragic circumstances surrounding Ms.
Whipple's death."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Houle and Plese were scheduled to begin jury selection for
Murphy's trial at the Inglewood courthouse. But the previous weekend,
Houle had called prosecutors and experts from the San Francisco case and
discovered the alleged connection between Murphy and the San Francisco
couple.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy changed her not guilty plea after Houle told the court about
what she had learned.</TE>

<HD>Judge Halts Work to Rehabilitate Venice Waterway</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Environmental groups laud decision in their fight against
the Coastal Commission and city over the Grand Canal Wetlands project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge Thursday halted all work on a project to rehabilitate the
Grand Canal Wetlands in Venice until an environmentalists' lawsuit is
resolved.</LD>
<LD>   The order came one week after the same San Francisco Superior Court
judge granted a temporary restraining order halting the draining, damming
and deepening of the waterway.</LD>
<LD>   The project, by the city of Los Angeles and the California Coastal
Commission, has been challenged by local and national environmental
groups.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a reprieve for the animals in the Grand Canal," said Marcia
Hanscom, director of the Malibu-based Wetlands Action Network. "We are
elated."</TE>
<TE>   Hanscom and the nonprofit network filed a lawsuit Jan. 8 alleging that
the commission violated the Coastal Act by failing to consider
alternatives and that it has endangered a sensitive habitat.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Ballona Wetlands Land Trust, the Coalition to Save
the Marina and the Sierra Club joined that suit against the city and the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.5-million project would deepen and landscape the Grand Canal
near Washington Boulevard to make it more aesthetically pleasing. It also
is intended to improve the canal's water quality, public access and
wetland habitat.</TE>
<TE>   But Hanscom said that "so far, the things they've tried to do here
have been problematic." For example, she said, saltbushes that have been
planted along the canal aren't natural to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to know what to plant. Plant what Mother Nature would have
planted," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Assistant City Atty. Susan Pfann said, "We feel quite strongly
that the project will be beneficial for the area. We're anxious to get
the project going."</TE>
<TE>   The judge's stay means no work can be done until the lawsuit is
settled, which could take six months or longer. The next hearing is set
for March 12.</TE>
<TE>   A condition of the project is that the southern portion be finished by
April 30, when the local population of least terns returns to feed. That
now appears improbable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be difficult. We already were delayed one week by the
temporary restraining order," said Russell Ruffing of the city engineer's
environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the project was supposed to make the Grand Canal resemble
the Venice Canal on the other side of Washington Boulevard. But, Ruffing
said, the city had to make substantial compromises to comply with the
Coastal Commission's guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the groups challenging the work say the Venice Canal should not
be a model.</TE>
<TE>Coastal Commission Faces New Setback</TE>
<TE>   "It might look nice and neat, but it doesn't do much for the ecology,"
Hanscom said.</TE>
<TE>   Concrete planters make a wall along the Venice Canal, and gravel lines
the bottom. Marine biologist Roy van de Hoek said it's so artificial that
the area's natural plants can't grow there and rare animals such as the
fiddler crab can't survive.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Canal, he said, "shows how marine biology should work" and
the Venice Canal shows "how it can go wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city will want to rethink this whole project in an
ecological way," Van de Hoek said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, the Coastal Commission faced another setback when
the Sierra Club and six other public interest groups filed a lawsuit
challenging the commission's approval of road expansion projects that the
groups say threaten Los Angeles wetlands, including the Ballona Wetlands.</TE>

<HD>School District Looks at $149 Million in Cutbacks</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles school officials on Wednesday weighed nearly $149
million in budget cuts and reshuffles, including a proposal to take $44
million directly from schools.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals, a response to lost state revenue and rising costs,
could affect everything from library materials to maintenance. Officials
of the Los Angeles Unified School District called the measures necessary,
but the teachers union assailed them as "reckless and irresponsible." The
union is seeking a raise for district teachers this year.</LD>
<LD>   The school board is scheduled to vote Thursday on the proposals.</LD>
<TE>   The district's chief financial officer said it might have to cut even
deeper next year. An initial list of potential cuts for 2002-03 targets
numerous popular programs. Among other things, class sizes would be
increased in all grades, and the number of nurses, counselors and
assistant principals would be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The school board will consider those proposed changes and others in
the coming months as it puts a budget together for next school year.</TE>

<LD>Police are searching for a man whose mother's body was found
Thursday in her home.</LD>
<LD>   Officers responding to calls from concerned relatives went to the home

<HD>Council Raises Reward for Graffiti Information</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council voted Wednesday to increase to $1,000 the reward
offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of graffiti
vandals.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Dennis Zine's motion to increase the reward from $500 was
approved unanimously without discussion.</LD>
<LD>   The motion was motivated in part by an increase since November of
graffiti in the Sherman Way Corridor in Canoga Park, said Martha Waltz,
Zine's communications director. Much of the vandalism was caused with a
glass etching cream, which causes damage that can't be removed, Waltz
said.</LD>

<LD>A motorist, apparently upset that a woman was driving too slowly on
the Hollywood Freeway on Wednesday night, fired several shots at her car,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The woman was driving from the 134 Freeway to the 170 Freeway shortly
after 11 p.m. when the man, believed to be in his 40s and driving a newer
model gray or silver coupe, began following her closely and flashing his
lights, Los Angeles Police Det. Mike Coffey said.</LD>
<LD>   When the two cars neared the Magnolia Boulevard exit in North
Hollywood, the man passed the woman on the left and fired four shots at
her vehicle, Coffey said.</LD>
<TE>   The woman was treated at the scene for a superficial wound to her
right buttock, Coffey said.</TE>

<HD>Seeking to Silence Dissent at Leisure World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playing political hardball more common to loftier institutions, the
top board that runs one of the nation's largest retirement communities is
moving to muzzle dissenters on 16 lower boards.</LD>
<LD>   Seal Beach Leisure World's umbrella Golden Rain Foundation is
proposing to ban any "statement of opinion" by members of the lower
boards without the approval of the foundation's board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   "This is fascist thinking," said Dave Lyon, 57, a member of one of the
16 management councils at the sprawling community. "Last I looked, this
was still the United States of America."</LD>
<TE>   It was unclear what prompted the foundation's board to float the
proposal, but residents and board members agreed that the foundation,
comprising representatives from all the boards at Leisure World, wants to
squelch dissent.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would prevent board members from making "any
representation or statement of opinion . . . except with the written
consent authorized by resolution of the board of directors."</TE>
<TE>   Administrators of the Golden Rain Foundation were not available to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   A group of lower board members and residents plans to challenge the
proposal. The group has prepared a letter to the state attorney general
asking for an investigation of the foundation's resolution, and if that
fails, the group plans to fight it in court.</TE>
<TE>   "If an entire board doesn't march in lock-step, they want to be able
to censure them," Lyon said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal states it is not meant to "censor or prevent any
resident, who may be a director, from expressing any personal opinion
they desire."</TE>
<TE>   However, it also says each board has the right to restrict every
member from making "any false representation of an opinion or statement."</TE>
<TE>   To Carol Franz, a member of a lower board, that means "I would be
turning my rights over to a group of people who would then tell me what I
can say and can't say."</TE>
<TE>   "I have forefathers that fought and died in the Revolutionary War for
my right of free speech, and I find this document to be very appalling."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed resolution and its prologue do not make it clear who
would decide if a statement is false, so it is open to interpretation,
Franz said.</TE>
<TE>   Leisure World, with a population of nearly 9,000, is struggling with
several contentious issues, including pet ownership, which is banned, and
plans for a huge new clubhouse that many feel is unneeded.</TE>
<TE>   Several residents said that opposition to the foundation on these
issues by lower board members may be at the root of the proposal.</TE>

<HD>20 Airmen Return Home to Cheers</HD>
<DH>Military: The pilots, back after months in Afghanistan, are
engulfed by their families after squadron lands at Point Mugu.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of directing bombing raids over Afghanistan, five E-2C
Hawkeye aircraft emerged over Point Mugu Naval Air Station on Thursday to
the cheers and cries of the pilots' families waiting below.</LD>
<LD>   Flying in diamond formation, the special radar-equipped surveillance
planes banked steeply before rolling onto the runway at the Navy base.</LD>
<LD>   Moments later, wives and children sprinted to the planes, nearly
tackling the 20 airmen as they appeared.</LD>
<TE>   For most, it had been more than six months since they had seen their
husbands and fathers. Some quickly made up for lost time.</TE>
<TE>   "Give papa a hug! Give papa a kiss! Tell papa what a cow says!" Lauren
Valluzzi Carambas urged her 1-year-old daughter, Madaline.</TE>
<TE>   Farther down the tarmac, Marina Pham toddled over to Lt. Cmdr. Tony
Pham.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been gone half her life," Pham said, hoisting his 1-year-old
daughter into his arms. "When I last saw her she couldn't walk."</TE>
<TE>   Airborne Early Warning Squadron 117 left Point Mugu on July 27 on
routine deployment aboard the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson. The carrier
was the closest ship to the Persian Gulf on Sept. 11, when the attacks on
the World Trade Center and Pentagon occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The squadron was quickly moved to the gulf and the Hawkeyes, the
Navy's newest carrier-based command-and-control aircraft, were among the
first planes used in the air war over Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The propeller-driven Hawkeyes, which have a large rotating radar disc
on top, flew over Afghanistan and instructed allied fighter and bomber
aircraft where to drop their payloads.</TE>
<TE>   "We were like the guys at the football game high up in the coach's box
looking down at the field and directing the plays," said Lt. Cmdr.
Michael Carambas, 35, of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   The airmen said they often attracted machine gun and antiaircraft fire
but were never hit.</TE>
<TE>   "You had to be flexible, because the game plan changes all the time,"
29-year-old Lt. Frank Perry said. "You might get a target and then have
to cancel and go somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way they picked up Al Qaeda transmissions, Carambas said.</TE>
<TE>   The planes flew every day for at least five hours and in November
logged 500 hours, said Commanding Officer John C. Oberst, 44, of
Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "We were doing battle management," Oberst said. "Every aircraft in the
theater would have to check in with us. Some came with bombing targets
and we would give targets to others."</TE>
<TE>   The planes left the deck of the Carl Vinson on Thursday morning when
it was still about 850 miles from its next stop in San Diego, Navy
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the pilots' arrival, relatives crowded inside a cavernous,
festively decorated hangar. Many were dressed in red, white and blue, and
some carried flags. Music, including Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind,"
filled the air. But the mood was one of restrained joy: No one wanted to
celebrate until the crewmen were safely on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Over the months, the families stayed in contact with the airmen via
e-mail and occasional phone calls. But their absence was difficult. Small
children such as Marina learned to eat solid food, hold a cup and finally
to take her first steps while her father was away. Wives had to juggle
the needs of their children and the mundane tasks of daily life alone.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't take a shower by yourself, can't eat in peace," said one
wife and mother. "It's nonstop, seven days a week. I don't know how
single mothers do it."</TE>
<TE>   And when the Sept. 11 attacks occurred, they faced it alone, not
knowing what it meant for them or their loved ones aboard the Carl
Vinson.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 was the only time I broke down," said Jodie Dodge, 25, of
Oxnard, the wife of Lt. Cmdr. Matt Dodge. "I didn't know where he was."</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes Pham, 31, of Ventura said she had no idea what would happen
to her husband after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew he was involved but didn't know the details," Pham said.</TE>
<TE>   For now the airmen plan to stay on the ground for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Molly Oberst, 45, wants to take a vacation with her husband, the
commanding officer of the wing.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly I just want to take care of him," she said. "And I want him to
take care of me."</TE>

<HD>Vandalism at Moorpark Mormon Church Probed as Hate Crime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A late-night rampage through a Mormon church in Moorpark is being
investigated as a hate crime after someone scrawled graffiti on the
pulpit, set fire to a scripture book and desecrated a painting depicting
the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</LD>
<LD>   Church officials and investigators with the Moorpark sheriff's
substation said several light switches and a thermostat were also ripped
out of the wall during the incident, which probably occurred between 10
p.m. Tuesday and 6 a.m. Wednesday. Damage was estimated at about $1,000,
said Senior Deputy Ed Tumbleson of the Moorpark substation.</LD>
<LD>   There are no suspects or witnesses, Tumbleson said, adding, "It's not
often we have this type of thing in Moorpark. I don't think someone
traveled miles to do this."</LD>
<TE>   Leaders of the 350-member congregation known as the 1st Ward, across
the street from Moorpark College, said they were "distressed and
confused" by the incident, the first vandalism of any kind at the
15-year-old building.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned that there is someone out there with the wrong
impression of the church," said Richard Taylor, president of the Thousand
Oaks stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which
includes the Moorpark congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "Why in the world would you do this? What would make you think it was
something you needed to express?"</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, who previously served as bishop--the spiritual leader--for the
Moorpark church, said steps are being taken to evaluate security and
prevent a repeat of such vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials said an instructor in the congregation's early
morning youth seminary classes made the discovery Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second case of vandalism of an east county religious
facility in the last seven months. Sheriff's investigators are still
searching for a suspect in a June incident at the Islamic Center of
Conejo Valley. Crudely worded messages criticizing Islam were scrawled on
the mosque's walls in red ink and spray paint.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Keith Parks, who oversees the sheriff's station in Thousand
Oaks, said the two incidents are classic examples of an attempt to
"intimidate, scare and prevent people from worshiping the way they want."</TE>
<TE>   "Snakes are always hard to find," Parks said. "They sneak in, do their
damage and leave."</TE>
<TE>   Such was the method of the vandals in Moorpark, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The current bishop, Peter Meline, said whoever caused the damage
either had a key to the building or walked through an unlocked door
during a Tuesday evening church meeting and hid until the building was
empty.</TE>
<TE>   There were no signs of forced entry on the building's doors or
windows, although several wire screens were ripped.</TE>
<TE>   Meline returned to the church Thursday as work crews rushed to make
repairs in time for weekend services.</TE>
<TE>   The damage included lighted cigarettes smashed into the face of Christ
in a painting depicting his return; the painting was in an entryway. A
Book of Mormon, a spiritual guide, was burned and propped up on the
sanctuary's oak pulpit. The word "Satan" and a profanity-laced message
were carved with a ballpoint pen into the pulpit as well as a nearby
table used in church ceremonies. Several wood pews had razor cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Meline said locks were changed at the church in response to the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   "I see this and I say, 'poor souls,' " Meline said.</TE>

<HD>New Metrolink Station to Debut Today in Tustin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commuter rail supporters will unveil Orange County's newest
Metrolink station today--a $7-million, automated railway pit stop that
officials hope will ultimately boost the line's modest yet growing
ridership.</LD>
<LD>   The station, in Tustin near Edinger Avenue, is the first of several
new rail platforms planned throughout Orange County. It will open for
business before dawn Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The new station, which features vaulted canopies and an underground
passageway with skylights, also is intended to relieve parking congestion
at the nearby Irvine Metrolink station.</LD>
<TE>   "This is going to be a huge help to commuters who live between Irvine
and Santa Ana," said Sarah L. Catz, a Metrolink director and former
member of the Orange County Transportation Authority. "It will absolutely
increase ridership because it will increase convenience."</TE>
<TE>   In terms of commuter convenience, the station offers such amenities as
automated ticket machines, drinking fountains, bicycle racks, newspaper
boxes and telephones. However, the one amenity that it doesn't offer
commuters is a restroom--a detail that was left out for fear that it
would encourage loitering and attract the homeless, according to one
transportation source.</TE>
<TE>   Officials such as Catz, however, said the lack of a restroom is not
unusual for such platforms, and poses no real inconvenience to commuters.</TE>
<TE>   "The bathrooms are on the train," Catz said. "Besides, most people
don't linger at these platforms. Most people are racing to take care of
their kids and get to the station on time. They usually jump on the train
as soon as they get there."</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin platform is along Metrolink's so-called Orange County Line,
and will serve commuters destined for Los Angeles, San Diego, Riverside
and San Bernardino counties. The platform does not offer Amtrak or
freight service.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hailed the station as an opportunity to reduce freeway
congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "Sitting on the 22 in bumper-to-bumper traffic is no fun," said Tustin
City Councilman Tony Kawashima, as he sat in such traffic on the Garden
Grove Freeway. "If this station helps take cars off the freeway and
reduces congestion, I'm all for it."</TE>
<TE>   Overall daily ridership along the county's two Metrolink lines is
about 4,500--a number that critics said is small compared with the
millions of car trips made daily by county residents.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials said ridership continues to grow, and will gain an
added boost from new platforms.</TE>
<TE>   A Laguna Niguel-Mission Viejo station is scheduled for completion in
the spring. A platform in Buena Park is scheduled to open next year.
Plans are in the works for a station in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin station, built on a four-acre parcel at Jamboree Road and
Edinger Avenue, offers 324 parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation agency officials said the station will help relieve
chronic parking problems at the nearby Metrolink station in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   At that station, more than a third of the parking lot's spaces are
taken up by so-called second cars left overnight by commuters.</TE>
<TE>   Rail commuters use the cars to get around during the workday, and then
leave them in the lot when they take the train home.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this new station will take some of the parking pressure
off," said George Urch, an agency spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Mike Marmer, 76; Emmy-Winning Scriptwriter From TV's Golden Age</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Marmer, veteran comedy writer from television's Golden Age who
shared an Emmy for his work on "The Carol Burnett Show," has died. He was
76.</LD>
<LD>   Marmer, who scripted sitcom episodes as well as variety sketches, died
Saturday in Los Angeles of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Frequently teamed with fellow funny man Stan Burns, Marmer worked with
him and others on the Carol Burnett sketch "Went With the Wind," a parody
of the classic "Gone With the Wind." The sketch earned the group of
writers the 1971-72 Emmy for outstanding writing achievement in variety
or music programs.</LD>
<TE>   Marmer's work also earned him a Sylvania television award and four
Writers Guild Awards.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote for most of the major comedy variety shows of the late 1950s
and 1960s, including those of Ernie Kovacs, Steve Allen, Jack Paar, the
Smothers Brothers, Flip Wilson, Milton Berle and Redd Foxx. He made
television specials a specialty, scripting at least 20 "Dean Martin
Roasts" and such 1970s fare as "The Ted Knight Musical Comedy Variety
Special Special," 'The First 50 Years" and "Lindsay Wagner: Another Side
of Me," and in the 1980s "Ladies and Gentlemen Bob Newhart" and "Success:
It Can Be Yours.'</TE>
<TE>   Among the series for which Marmer wrote scripts were "Gilligan's
Island," 'F Troop," 'Get Smart" and "Three's Company.'</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Marmer's most unusual show, and certainly one of the most
beloved, was the Saturday morning children's show "Lancelot Link, Secret
Chimp," which ran on ABC from 1970 to 1972. With Burns, Marmer created,
produced and wrote the show, which has been described as "'Get Smart'
with fur and psychedelic music.'</TE>
<TE>   Costly because of special lighting and use of many animals, the show
featured Lancelot Link, super agent for Agency to Prevent Evil (APE), an
allusion to the popular detective series "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." Link
and his female partner Mata Hari battled such villains as the Duchess,
the Baron, Wang Fu, Dr. Strangemind and Ali AssaSeen, who worked for the
evildoers' association known as C.H.U.M.P.</TE>
<TE>   A sendup of all spy shows of the era, including the spoof "Get Smart"
itself, the show even had its own rock band, called the Evolution
Revolution, with fairly catchy songs-all written by Marmer and Burns.</TE>
<TE>   A documentary about the "Lancelot Link" show by Diane Bernard and Jeff
Krulik was voted best documentary at the 1999 New York Underground Film
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Born Merrill D. Marmer in Lowell, Mass., Marmer served as a Marine on
Okinawa in World War II. He later graduated from Suffolk University in
Boston and acted in regional theater in New York and New England before
beginning his writing career.</TE>
<TE>   Married three times, Marmer is survived by a son, Miles Crakow of Los
Angeles; a daughter, Jennifer Crakow of San Francisco; and a sister, Ruth
Fishman of Framingham, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial donations be sent to the American
Cancer Society or to Stepping Stones Youth Shelter on the Paiute-Shoshone
Indian Reservation, 8955 Mission Road, Fallon Indian Reservation, NV
89406.</TE>

<LD>Steve Oakey of the San Diego Union-Tribune reports that golf pros
Charles Howell III and Jesper Parnevik, who already wear the same
clothing line, are starting to think alike.</LD>
<LD>   "Did we land on the moon, or is that a fabrication?" Howell asked
during a recent tournament. "Yeah, there's a flag up there, but the flag
is pointing out and there's no wind to blow the flag.</LD>
<LD>   "Think about that.</LD>
<TE>   "Jesper also thinks we're on the outer part of the Earth, and if you
look at the sky, you're actually looking inward. So if you were to fly
from the Earth into the sun, you'd actually be flying into the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "The rotation of the Earth keeps us suspended, hanging from the middle
of it. See what I'm saying?"</TE>
<TE>   No, but it's fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL playoff record for the longest field
goal?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Job awaits him: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle: "The
Raiders' Darrell Russell explained his latest drug violation to Fox's Jim
Rome by saying somebody spiked his drink with Ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   "He again blamed his first violation on second-hand marijuana smoke
and his second on not being notified of a scheduled drug test at his
home.</TE>
<TE>   "During this year's suspension, Russell could stay busy as a
consultant to Enron."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>   Kind hit man: Brian Urlacher, the Chicago Bears' outstanding
second-year linebacker, isn't mean enough, according to that old meanie,
Bear linebacker Dick Butkus.</TE>
<TE>   Butkus told the New York Times that he didn't like to see Urlacher
knock a player down and then help him up.</TE>
<TE>   Responded Urlacher, "I like hitting someone so hard they don't know
where they are, but I don't want to be a jerk about it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fraudulent fans: Oakland authorities have issued several citations to
Raider fans for fraudulently using disabled placards to park closer to
Oakland's Network Associates Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people were coming in with those things, it was like shooting
ducks in a pond--the abuse was outrageous," Oakland police Lt. Dave
Kozicki said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Credit where it's due: Brenda Warner, wife of St. Louis Ram
quarterback Kurt Warner, did the talking for him at a news conference
announcing Warner's winning the most-valuable-player award because he had
been told to rest his ailing vocal cords.</TE>
<TE>   Said Brenda, "Kurt would first like to thank his wife for everything
he's ever done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Food fight: With William "the Refrigerator" Perry pulling out,
Butterbean Esch will fight former Steeler offensive lineman Craig Wolfley
on Feb. 3 in Gulfport, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfley, a 260-pounder who gives up about 100 pounds to Butterbean,
says, "The real fight will be at the buffet table."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Pete Stoyanovich of Miami, 58 yards against Kansas City
in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tom Keegan in the New York Post: "The Dodgers have
finally gotten back at the Mets for creating such a soft landing strip
for Mike Piazza after they foolishly dealt him.</TE>
<TE>   "They got back at the Mets by sending Gary Sheffield to the Braves in
a trade nearly as one-sided as the Mets' heist of Robbie Alomar from the
Indians."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These people live among you:</LD>
<LD>   Yiming Tung: "In the world according to me, serving notice bridges the
gap between the civilized world and the world of chaos. Now to serve
notice on L.A. Times writer T.J. Simers. The constant barrage of insults
and derision of local teams has crossed the line. I yearn to read about
the hopes and promises of spring, not opinions that ridicule my miserable
life for being worse than it really is."</LD>
<LD>   I would never make fun of your miserable life.</LD>
<TE>   Jim Campbell: "I've been a big Angels' fan all my life, and ... "</TE>
<TE>   Sir, I can't help you.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Walter: "If you're ever in Omaha, I'd like to buy you 'The Jerk,'
a drink. I'm assuming that's what T.J. stands for. If your brains were
gasoline, there wouldn't be enough inside your head to power an ant
around the inside of a Cheerio."</TE>
<TE>   I guess I don't have to tell you to start drinking without me.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Post: "Just shut up and go away. What is your problem with Shaq
hitting back after getting hit so often? Maybe you'll get it through your
big, fat, thick skull why Shaq defended himself. Go back to wherever you
came from. We don't like you. You better stay away from Staples Center
yourself; I'm sure people are fed up with you. I read your stupid article
and as usual you think it's all a big joke."</TE>
<TE>   I love you, man.</TE>
<TE>   KathrynBlueJe: "I'm usually as mild-mannered as Clark Kent, but you
are a [donkey]. I was looking forward to reading a nice article on the
Angels and I had to read that thing you wrote. I told my doctor about the
article ... "</TE>
<TE>   I don't always get the chance to say it, but I wish the best for all
my sick e-mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Dwyer: "I'm a hockey fan and you're a wimp. Being a sportswriter
on page two for the Times you should be promoting all sports and not
disparaging them."</TE>
<TE>   Why is it that everyone named Dwyer has no idea what they're talking
about?</TE>
<TE>   Robert Sinik: "You are fat."</TE>
<TE>   It certainly can't be because of my wife's cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Grey Brooks: "Do you really believe no response to aggression is the
correct response? I'm surprised at your criticism of Shaq for defending
himself. Do you condemn Robin Hood? Dirty Harry? Do you think we
responded properly after Pearl Harbor?"</TE>
<TE>   Are you suggesting Shaq should have responded with bow and arrow, .357
Magnum or atomic bomb?</TE>
<TE>   John Ward: "I just read your story on the Angels. I need a mop to wipe
up all the sarcasm. Your tone is ridiculous and completely unnecessary.
You remind me of that kid in junior high who has to roll his eyes at
anything the teacher says."</TE>
<TE>   I wish you could see me right now.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Mena: "I got to see your sports show and you guys talking about
Shaq. Don't ever give your expert opinion on something you know nothing
about. You two are the kind of guys that would be punked out of lunch and
dinner, get sand kicked in your face and still do nothing. Call me if you
wanna do anything about it, geeks."</TE>
<TE>   I'll give Plaschke your number.</TE>
<TE>   Bob McIntyre: "Well, you have the Shaq incident all wrong and need to
change your points of view or better play me on the basketball court or I
will meet you in the supermarket. I have read both of you--Simmers'
column is a little off kilter for me, but something different, while I've
liked the stuff [Plaschke] has written. But shame on both of you."</TE>
<TE>   Name the supermarket and Plaschke will be there.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Patricia Vanelli: "It's easy for middle-aged, overweight men
who've never played at competitive sports, much less professional sports,
to sit in their plush chairs and criticize."</TE>
<TE>   It'd be even easier if we never had to get up, and there was a Ms.
around to serve us dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Cory Sevening: "Looooooooooooooser."</TE>
<TE>   Good news: I hear spell-check is coming to Nebraska next year.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kuka: "I am still a fan of the Angels and I love my team. I found
your article not funny and insulting. You probably kick little dogs and
pop kids' balloons as you pass by."</TE>
<TE>   The look on the kids' faces is just priceless.</TE>
<TE>   David Price, NCAA vice president for enforcement services: "You
mentioned you don't get invited to many places any more. I have the same
problem. Maybe we should start a club."</TE>
<TE>   We could have our meetings at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Guzman: "I have a four-year-old daughter, who until Saturday
wanted to play for the Sparks, but she changed her mind after watching
what happened to Shaq. She said, 'If I'm bigger than everyone else
they're all going to beat me up when I get the ball."'</TE>
<TE>   It's nice to hear something good came as a result of what happened to
Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson Inman: "I have canceled my subscription to the Times because
of your careless characterization of Nebraska fans."</TE>
<TE>   You might want to reconsider: There was great care given in the
characterization of Nebraska fans.</TE>
<TE>   David Moore: "In times like these, it seems to me the job of the local
media is to edify the local teams. Let's say for argument, the Angels up
and move to another city, thus requiring half as many baseball
sportswriters in Southern California. I'd be happy to put your name at
the top of the list of those to go."</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, but I'll be spending more time with our great hockey teams.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Dote: "I want to know why you have so much hate for the Angels.
I'm tired of reading blatant Angel bashing articles. It's funny how
rarely I see any Dodger bashing."</TE>
<TE>   You're right--I have to start bashing the Dodgers more.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Grier: "Please, if you have nothing intelligent to write about
figure skating, don't bother."</TE>

<HD>Olson Probe Led to New Evidence in 1975 Slaying</HD>

<LD>Changes in technology and politics, along with luck and hard work,
revived the case against five former revolutionaries accused of killing a
bystander during a 1975 armed robbery of a Crocker National Bank branch
in a suburb outside Sacramento, prosecutors and legal analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-five years ago, federal attorneys in Sacramento failed to
convict an alleged member of the Symbionese Liberation Army of
participating in the robbery. And for more than two decades, no further
charges were filed, despite a one-man campaign by the son of victim Myrna
Opsahl to prosecute members of the violent terrorist group who allegedly
took part.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, during its prosecution of Sara Jane Olson for an attempted
firebombing of Los Angeles police cars, the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office said it compiled enough physical evidence to file
murder charges.</LD>
<TE>   Olson, along with former SLA members William and Emily Harris, Mike
Bortin and James Kilgore, were charged with murder this week. Four of the
five were arrested Wednesday, leaving only Kilgore--a fugitive for
years--at large. The FBI has posted a $20,000 reward for information
leading to his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said it remains a difficult case to prove.</TE>
<TE>   The new evidence matched descriptions of the crime provided by
Patricia Hearst, the newspaper heiress kidnapped by the SLA, and
allegedly links the Harrises, Bortin, Kilgore and Olson to Opsahl's
death, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   "All the L.A. prosecutor did was compile the evidence, review it and
say, 'Wow, this is a great case,' " said Dr. Jon Opsahl, the victim's
son. "Somehow Sacramento County never matched up [Hearst's] statements
with the physical evidence and realized what a credible case they had."</TE>
<TE>   Retired Sacramento County Sheriff's Deputy Larry Stamm, who
interviewed Hearst for the case in 1976, agreed that the case was dormant
until Los Angeles County prosecutors reviewed it while preparing to try
Olson on the bombing charge. As it turned out, they never had to go to
trial in that case, because Olson, after much hand-wringing, ultimately
pleaded guilty. She is scheduled to be sentenced today in Los Angeles
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles prosecutors . . . felt we had a pretty good case," Stamm
said. "It was great to meet with them and listen to their theories. They
had some thoughts that, had they been there 26 years ago, they might have
prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't do that," he said, "so we're here today."</TE>
<TE>Judge's Ruling a Breakthrough</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, who took office in
December 2000, said the breakthrough had come when a judge in Los Angeles
ruled "that the history of the SLA, including Carmichael, could be
introduced in the bombing case here because it was part of an ongoing
criminal conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   With that ruling, Cooley said, Los Angeles authorities "brought to
light a tremendous amount of evidence that they were prepared to present
in their case."</TE>
<TE>   As recently as last January, Sacramento district attorney's
spokeswoman Robin Shakely said the killing at the Carmichael bank was
simply "not prosecutable." But after prodding from L.A. County
prosecutors, Sacramento Dist. Atty. Jan Scully in March formed a task
force to review the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The state of the evidence today has convinced me that now is the time
to seek justice for Myrna Opsahl," Scully said at the news conference
Wednesday announcing the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they can back up statements Hearst made to FBI
authorities with witness accounts and ballistics evidence. "There has
been some new evidence that has surfaced recently which we believe
establishes additional corroborating evidence linking those named by
Patty Hearst to the Crocker bank robbery and murder," Scully said. Hearst
long ago was granted immunity from prosecution for her role, as were
alleged accomplices Steven Soliah and Wendy Yoshimura.</TE>
<TE>   Court papers filed Wednesday in Sacramento County Superior Court cited
three new developments that prompted prosecutors to file charges.</TE>
<TE>   First, shotgun pellets removed from Myrna Opsahl's body were sent to
the FBI Crime Laboratory in August 2000. Through new laboratory
procedures, technicians determined that the pellets matched shotgun
ammunition recovered from an SLA safe house in Sacramento and that both
were made at the same manufacturing plant.</TE>
<TE>   Second, after Sara Jane Olson's arrest, FBI agents matched Olson's
palm to a print from a garage door in Sacramento where one of the two
getaway cars used in the robbery was stored.</TE>
<TE>   Third, when Olson pleaded guilty in October 2001 to attempting to blow
up Los Angeles Police Department cars in 1975, it helped confirm what
Hearst had told authorities--that the Crocker National Bank robbery
financed the "SLA's continued revolution, including the bombings of law
enforcement officials."</TE>
<TE>   The bombing case was revived in 1999 after the FBI arrested Olson, who
had changed her name from Kathleen Soliah and settled into a comfortable
life in St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>'Every Nook and Cranny'</TE>
<TE>   Peter Keane, dean of Golden Gate University Law School in San
Francisco, said he agrees that the catalyst to pursuing the Carmichael
bank killing is the prosecution of Olson in Los Angeles. In preparing for
Olson's trial, the Los Angeles County prosecutors studied "every nook and
cranny" of the SLA and intended to present the radical group's history to
a jury, Keane said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sacramento County prosecutors, Keane said, still have a difficult
case to prove.</TE>
<TE>   "The ability to convict these people is not going to be any slam-dunk
walk in the park," he said. "If that were true, they wouldn't have waited
27 years."</TE>
<TE>   On April 21, 1975, armed robbers stormed into the Crocker bank,
shooting Myrna Opsahl and fleeing with $15,000 in cash. Opsahl had been
depositing collections for the Seventh-day Adventist Church she attended.
Eyewitnesses said she was shot for no apparent reason.</TE>
<TE>   One of the toughest prosecution hurdles, Keane said, could be getting
a jury to believe testimony from Hearst. Defense attorneys probably will
attack her as a criminal who has benefited from telling her story to
authorities and the public, Keane said, and could resurrect the infamous
image of an armed Hearst standing in a threatening pose robbing a bank.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is still going to depend on how the jury determines
the credibility of Patty Hearst," Keane said. "That's still an open
question."</TE>
<TE>   Hearst didn't testify in the only other case brought in the Carmichael
robbery--the failed prosecution of Steven Soliah--in part because federal
prosecutors at the time were skeptical of her account.</TE>
<TE>Series of Setbacks</TE>
<TE>   That case relied largely on other eyewitnesses who placed Soliah in
the bank during the robbery--but was plagued by a series of setbacks.
Prosecutors lost one key eyewitness when the judge refused to allow any
testimony about her identification of Soliah in a police lineup, said
Richard Nichols, a Sacramento attorney who was an assistant federal
prosecutor in the case. And one defense witness, a San Francisco
masseuse, testified that Soliah was at her home at the time of the
robbery, although authorities later said they had proof that the masseuse
was visiting an inmate at Folsom Prison at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors went after Soliah alone because they had even less
evidence against the others, Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   "Put it this way," he said. "If we felt that we had enough evidence to
charge anyone other than Steven Soliah at that time, we would have done
so."</TE>
<TE>   Sara Jane Olson's attorney, Shawn Chapman, insisted Thursday that
nothing has changed since then except for "the dogged determination of
Mr. Opsahl and the relentless pressure of the district attorney's office
in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman said she doesn't believe there is a strong case against her
client, who continues to maintain that she did not take part in the
robbery and killing. The Harrises and Bortin also have asserted their
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a mood of antagonism against anyone that they can
label as a terrorist," said Sheldon Otis, a former defense lawyer in
Oakland who successfully defended Steven Soliah in the robbery case and
whose other clients have included Black Panther Huey Newton.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it could be very, very detrimental to the people now
charged," he said. "That's going to be a tough one."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Kills Six at Celebration</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Angry guests at a bat mitzvah overpower an attacker, who
is slain. Israeli fighter jets swiftly retaliate in West Bank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian militant armed with a gun and grenades burst into a
crowded banquet hall in northern Israel late Thursday and opened fire on
the dancing guests at a young girl's bat mitzvah. At least six people
were shot to death and 30 others were wounded before police and enraged
guests overpowered and killed the assailant.</LD>
<LD>   The attack in the city of Hadera came as a relative lull in violence
evaporated, along with hopes for a breakthrough after more than 15 months
of bloodletting. It was the deadliest incident in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict in more than a month, and the Israeli government vowed harsh
reprisal.</LD>
<LD>   A militia affiliated with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack.</LD>
<TE>   Early this morning, Israeli fighter jets destroyed a Palestinian
government complex in the West Bank town of Tulkarm, killing one police
officer and wounding nearly 40 other security personnel. And in Ramallah,
Israeli troops and armor were bearing down on Arafat's headquarters. The
army said the actions were in retaliation for the Hadera shooting and
other attacks this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the militia affiliated with Fatah, was
quoted as saying that it had staged the Hadera raid to avenge the death
of Raed Karmi, a militia commander killed Monday in an explosion in his
hometown of Tulkarm. Karmi had long been near the top of Israel's
most-wanted list.</TE>
<TE>   In Hadera, Israeli police said a lone Palestinian dressed in dark
clothes approached the entrance of the Palace of David banquet hall, on
the city's central President Street. He ran into the foyer, opened fire
with an M-16 assault rifle and was about to lob a grenade when guests and
banquet hall employees, some armed with bottles, charged him.</TE>
<TE>   The angry revelers overpowered the gunman when his gun apparently
jammed.</TE>
<TE>   Yossi Elbaz, a co-owner of the hall, led the charge and kicked the
assailant "with all his might," said an associate, Shimon Asraf.</TE>
<TE>   "We crushed him. We crushed him, then we dragged him outside and
started stomping on him," Elbaz told reporters. Elbaz said he believed he
had killed the man, breaking his own toe in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Police rushed the man and shot him, a police spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Local reports identified the assailant as Abed Hassounah, a
27-year-old militant from the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and father of two
from a village near the West Bank city of Nablus. Hadera is a few miles
from the West Bank and has been the scene of several Palestinian attacks
in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Palace of David was crowded with about 180 people celebrating the
bat mitzvah of a girl from a family that had emigrated in the last decade
from the former Soviet Union. The shooting started when the guests were
"at the peak of celebration," one person in attendance said.</TE>
<TE>   An unarmed guard at the door was among the dead, hall employees said.
Other dead included Russian-born guests at the party.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials reported six dead, plus the assailant, with at
least 30 wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors helped carry the wounded to ambulances, wrapping them in
tablecloths from the banquet room.</TE>
<TE>   Television footage from the scene showed a disheveled banquet hall,
with dishes scattered on hastily emptied tables and a few overturned
chairs. An askew picture of Nina, the guest of honor, stood at the head
of one table.</TE>
<TE>   "People were still dancing when he opened fire," witness Avi Kakon
told Israeli television. "He advanced toward the banquet hall while
shooting. He shot people who were sitting at tables."</TE>
<TE>   Shlomo Aharonishky, the national police chief, said there had been
numerous alerts in the last few days of a likely terrorist attack in
northern Israel. Police forces had been redoubled along the border
between Israel and the West Bank, and new roadblocks were set up
throughout the area after the attack, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had intensified our alertness around cities we consider to be our
underbelly," he said. "But no deployment can prevent a suicide attack."</TE>
<TE>   The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon held Arafat responsible
for Thursday's attack, accusing him of failing to dismantle the
infrastructure used by Palestinian extremists to wage war on Israelis.
Retaliation was swift.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to take strong action against the terrorists,"
government spokesman Avi Pazner told reporters. "We are going to respond
in a manner which will teach the Palestinian Authority a lesson they will
not forget."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department condemned the "vicious" terrorist attack and
demanded that Arafat seize the killers and "confront the infrastructure
that perpetuates terror and violence."</TE>
<TE>   With more than 1,000 lives, the majority of them Palestinian, lost
since September 2000, Arafat on Dec. 16 ordered a halt to all Palestinian
attacks on Israelis. Violence dropped off precipitously until members of
the radical Islamic Hamas movement killed four Israeli soldiers near the
Gaza Strip last week.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Monday, Karmi was killed in an explosion widely attributed to
Israel that was seen as a return of the Sharon government's controversial
policy of assassinating top Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian reprisal was swift: The Al Aqsa Brigade killed an Israeli
soldier Monday evening, and three civilians--a 71-year-old American who
had lived for decades in the region, an Israeli woman settler and a
Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem in a possible case of mistaken
identity--were killed Tuesday and Wednesday in shootings that have also
been blamed on the militia.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces killed another member of the militia early Thursday in
what the army described as a shootout near Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's Cabinet met overnight Wednesday and early Thursday to weigh
reprisals and ordered the tightening of Israeli blockades of several
Palestinian cities. Early today, Cabinet hard-liners were criticizing
that decision as being too soft and demanding tougher action in light of
the Hadera attack.</TE>
<TE>   But some Israelis questioned whether the timing of Karmi's killing
didn't stoke the escalation. Israeli officials argue that he was a
"ticking bomb" who had killed Israelis and was bound to kill more.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, meanwhile, had additional troubles. In Ramallah, the West Bank
city where he has been under an Israeli-imposed virtual house arrest, a
radical group threatened to kill senior Palestinian security officials in
protest over the arrest of its leader.</TE>

<HD>Next Deadline on Air Safety Daunting</HD>
<DH>Security: Airports are scrambling for huge machines to meet a
year-end screening rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Closer inspection for bombs hidden in baggage--the first step in
building a new aviation security system--begins across the nation today,
but the next big deadline facing the government is even more daunting.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of the year, 429 airports with regularly scheduled airline
service must install machines to detect explosives that would make
baggage screening much more secure than the temporary measures announced
this week. Yet even if enough of the $1-million machines can be built in
time--about 2,200 are needed--Los Angeles International and many other
airports simply lack the space for the truck-sized units. It is one of
many problems confronting aviation officials for which there are still no
answers.</LD>
<LD>   "I think by mid-summer they're going to realize they can't meet the
deadline--they're going to have to modify it," said Michael DiGirolamo,
deputy director of operations at LAX. "This is the most overwhelming
project that the industry has faced, both on the government side and the
airlines' side. I think it's so large and so overwhelming that I don't
think people have grasped just how large and overwhelming it is."</LD>
<TE>   Publicly, Transportation Department officials say they will do
"everything humanly possible" to meet the Dec. 31 deadline set by
Congress. But privately, some officials concede that the odds are against
them.</TE>
<TE>   The logistical problems quickly became apparent at LAX. Airport
managers were flabbergasted when their calculations showed they might
need as many as 251 of the 3-ton machines to detect explosives because of
the sheer volume of baggage the airport handles.</TE>
<TE>   The physical limitations of airports are not the only challenges for
the fledgling Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   As the year unfolds, the agency also will be taking over passenger
screening by deploying a yet-to-be-hired force of nearly 30,000 uniformed
federal employees. Much of the changeover will take place during the
summer travel season.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, airlines are pushing for a government-approved "trusted
traveler" program that would grant several million people who agree to
periodic background checks special credentials allowing them to use
high-speed checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to build a new law enforcement agency starting essentially
from scratch--an agency with more people than the FBI, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Border Patrol combined--and get it up
and running in the next 11 months," Transportation Secretary Norman Y.
Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   Explosives detection remains the greatest challenge, Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   A journey through the bowels of LAX's baggage-handling system reveals
the problem: The miles of screeching conveyor belts were never designed
to incorporate bomb-screening in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   At the Bradley terminal, an 18-year-old conveyor belt shudders as it
ferries hundreds of bags from ticket counters to the quarter-mile-long
sorting room. The system backs up quickly. Bags linger on the floor,
waiting to be loaded into metal luggage containers. At one conveyor,
workers place bags through a decades-old X-ray machine mounted in the
back of a beat-up van.</TE>
<TE>   Just one month ago, LAX officials said they would need 120 of the new
machines to detect explosives, which employ CT technology similar to what
hospitals use to find tumors in the human body. But after receiving
additional data from the Federal Aviation Administration, officials more
than doubled that estimate, to 251. It turns out that LAX--the world's
third-busiest airport--handles a disproportionately large share of
"originating" bags, those that are first entering the system.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the worst-case scenario, because more bags are checked here
than at any other airport in the world," LAX spokesman Paul Haney said.</TE>
<TE>   At some other major airports, like Chicago's O'Hare, a bigger
proportion of the passengers are connecting and have already checked
their bags. Under the system due to be in place by year's end, those bags
would have been scanned at the originating airport.</TE>
<TE>   While the scale of problems may not be as overwhelming as at LAX,
other airports are going to encounter the same space crunch, said Paul
Bollinger, a vice president of HNTB, an architectural and engineering
firm that specializes in airports.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at going back to retrofit airports to incorporate this
equipment, and the space may not be there," Bollinger said. "That's when
it's going to get expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the 13 machines that currently operate at LAX have been
installed in passenger check-in areas, because there's no room for them
elsewhere. They are so heavy that engineers will not allow them to be
placed in certain locations.</TE>
<TE>   Most airlines at LAX have yet to unveil their plans for the new
machines. (The federal government will pay for the equipment, but the
airlines and airports must find a place to put it.) American Airlines has
discussed closing a gate--worth millions of dollars in ticket revenue--to
build an area that would incorporate 18 machines.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Feb. 1, airlines will begin collecting a passenger security
fee of $2.50 per leg of a trip, with a limit of $10 on a round-trip
ticket. That is expected to raise more than $1.7 billion a year, no more
than a down payment on the as-yet-unknown cost of the new security
system.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts are warning that the fixation on deadlines and new
machines could backfire. Thomas Hartwick, chairman of a National Academy
of Sciences panel on aviation security, is concerned that the new
security agency will lose sight of the overall picture.</TE>
<TE>   "All the pieces have to play together," Hartwick said. The system
"will only be as strong as its weakest part."</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the new airport security measures are bound to affect
nearly every family in the United States, since airlines transport nearly
700 million passengers a year. Among other possible changes:</TE>
<TE>   * When a customer calls to make a reservation, airlines will make
greater use of profiling software to separate passengers who pose no risk
from those who might, and therefore deserve a closer look.</TE>
<TE>   * More shops and restaurants will be located before the security
screening checkpoints, instead of in concourse areas that are now open
only to ticketed passengers. At LAX, about 95% of the concessions are
located beyond security, and many are suffering heavy losses.</TE>
<TE>   * Passenger checkpoints may get independent means of validating
identification. In addition to standard metal detectors and X-ray
machines, there may be computer terminals that allow a quick check of
passengers' driver's licenses, much like the equipment found in police
cruisers.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Knew of Enron Risks Last February</HD>

</DL>
<LD>Top executives at the Chicago headquarters of accounting firm
Andersen discussed Enron's financial problems in February, but two months
later its auditors gave the energy giant's books a clean bill of health,
documents show.</LD>
<LD>   The Feb. 5 meeting represents the earliest known date that senior
Andersen officers--including its head of U.S. operations--knew about such
issues as Enron's aggressive deal making, internal conflicts of interest
and huge compensation packages for its senior management.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting, held by telephone between Chicago and the Houston branch
office that handled the Enron account, was detailed in an e-mail the next
day. Andersen has contended that it was unaware of serious problems until
August.</LD>
<TE>   The e-mail memo reported that Andersen considered dropping Enron as a
client, though it noted that the accounting firm could earn fees from
Enron reaching $100 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, the conclusion was reached to retain Enron as a client
[because] it appeared that we had the appropriate people and processes in
place to serve Enron and manage our engagement risks," the e-mail read.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen auditors in April signed off on Enron's financial statement
for fiscal years 2000 and 1999, saying it "fairly represented" the
company's condition.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until Oct. 16 that Enron reported serious financial losses,
although Andersen had the ability to rescind its approval of the
company's financial statements at any time.</TE>
<TE>   The new disclosures came as Enron's board fired Andersen as its
auditor and Congress pushed ahead with its probe of the Houston-based
company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   After obtaining the e-mail, congressional investigators on Thursday
sent a letter to Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, seeking
more information about the senior-level meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail from Andersen executive Michael E. Jones to partner David
B. Duncan related to a meeting the day before in which Andersen
executives discussed some of the Enron accounting methods that have
become the subject of criminal and congressional probes.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail raised concerns about conflicts of interest from a
partnership managed by Enron's then-chief financial officer, Andrew S.
Fastow, which investigators say was used to hide the energy company's
debts. The meeting is significant because until its disclosure, attention
has focused on Andersen's Houston office, where Duncan--chief auditor on
the Enron account--was fired and seven others disciplined Tuesday because
of the destruction of Enron-related records.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman, Patrick Dorton, said Thursday that "nothing in
the meeting or the memo indicated that any illegal actions or improper
accounting was suspected." He said it was not until Enron Vice President
Sherron S. Watkins alerted auditors in August that the accounting firm
"became aware that individuals within Enron believed that there may have
been accounting improprieties."</TE>
<TE>   But Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, one of several congressional panels investigating Enron's
collapse, said: "From our perspective, the memo made it clear that some
Andersen officials were clearly aware of the risks of having Enron as a
client but decided in the end the company was too much of a cash cow to
cut loose."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail also said that during the conference call, executives
discussed how Enron "often is creating industries and markets and
transactions for which there are no specific rules." The memo said Fastow
faced potential conflicts from his role both as an officer of the energy
trader and a paid manager of the LJM partnership that was doing business
with the company.</TE>
<TE>   The question was left unanswered as to whether the Securities and
Exchange Commission would view Fastow and LJM as an affiliate of Enron,
which would have obligated Andersen to wrap the financial results of LJM
into the figures for the larger company.</TE>
<TE>   Once disclosed, the debt and losses at LJM and other partnerships led
to a rapid decline in Enron's credit rating, pushing the company to file
for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Fastow declined to comment on the House investigation
but added that Enron's former chief financial officer did not hide his
involvement with off-balance-sheet partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enron board of directors had full knowledge and understanding of
Mr. Fastow's potential conflicts and gave its full approval," said his
spokesman, Gordon Andrew. "Business law does not say that conflicts of
interest per se are illegal in any regard as long as they are disclosed
and approved."</TE>
<TE>   When Enron issued its annual report in April, Andersen asserted that
in its opinion the financial statements "present fairly . . . the
financial position of Enron Corp. and subsidiaries as of Dec. 31, 2000,
and 1999 . . . in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail was raised by congressional investigators during a private
meeting with fired auditor Duncan this week. Duncan, one of 14 Andersen
employees on the Feb. 5 conference call, was fired for allegedly ordering
the destruction of documents. He has denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokeswoman Anne Groves said the e-mail summary of the
teleconference confirmed that senior management had discussed various
issues surrounding the Enron audit. The people at "this meeting
represented every aspect of our work at the company at a senior level,"
she said. "They were the right people to make the decisions that were
made."</TE>
<TE>   One of the meeting's participants was Steve Samek, who at the time was
the firm's managing partner for its U.S. operations. Another was Robert
Kutsenda, who was censured by the SEC in June and barred from working on
the audit of a publicly traded company for a year because of his
involvement in Andersen's audit of Waste Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen paid a $7-million fine in that audit to settle fraud
charges--the largest civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was not one of the lead partners in the audit, Kutsenda,
Andersen's central-region audit practice director, consulted on Waste
Management and engaged "in highly unreasonable conduct that resulted in a
violation of applicable professional standards," according to SEC
records.</TE>
<TE>   Kutsenda has since retired from the firm, Groves said, and Samek is a
partner in a different position.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Andersen said the meeting described in the e-mail was
routine, of a sort typically done to assess the firm's work on all large
engagements. It defended the memo's use of such terms as "intelligent
gambling," saying that was a reference to the "mark-to-market" method of
accounting, which "is based on sophisticated models using assumptions
about events likely to occur in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Attendance of a large number of partners, including senior staff, is
typical at these meetings, according to Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "Client acceptance is a continuous process. Before we sign off on an
audit, or decide to continue as the auditor for a company, we consider
all major events to confirm or modify our conclusions about our audit
opinion and our decision to continue as the company's auditor," the
firm's statement said.</TE>
<TE>   "The identification of a particular issue during one of these meetings
does not indicate that the firm has reached any conclusions about the
appropriateness of an accounting treatment or judgment. It simply
indicates that such issues need to be addressed in the audit, if the firm
continues the relationship."</TE>
<TE>   As for its firing by Enron, Andersen said: "As a matter of fact, our
relationship with Enron ended when the company's business failed and it
went into bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay said Thursday in a statement that although
the company has been conducting its own investigation and had been
"willing to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt . . . we can't afford
to wait any longer in light of recent events, including the reported
destruction of documents by Andersen personnel and the disciplinary
actions taken against several of Andersen's partners working in its
Houston office."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators, meanwhile, also made available an Aug. 21
internal Andersen memo detailing a call from Watkins to an Andersen
employee raising concerns about accounting methods that "did not tell the
'whole story.' " She raised similar concerns to Lay the same month.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Commerce and
Energy Committee, said his panel's investigation is in its early stages.
But he said the fallout from the Enron debacle could fill his committee's
agenda for much of this year and that an overhaul of the nation's
accounting standards is almost certainly in order.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin suggested in an interview that it may be time to consider
prohibiting accounting firms to perform audit and business consulting
work for the same client. Critics have long complained of the inherent
conflicts in such lucrative arrangements, but Congress has resisted such
changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We may all need to reconsider our position on that," Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin expects his committee to hold hearings this month on the
document destruction conducted by Andersen's Houston office after it
learned of the SEC probe.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, spokesman Ari Fleischer spent a second day on the
defensive, declaring that the administration had not tailored its energy
proposal to benefit Enron. He called a report by Rep. Henry A. Waxman
(D-Los Angeles) that contends that the administration's proposal benefits
Enron "a partisan waste of taxpayer money."</TE>
<TE>   The White House finds itself in a bind--to some extent one of its own
making. After first disclosing Enron's efforts to reach out to two
Cabinet members--Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary
Don Evans--it has adopted a defensive posture. Officials have declined to
say to what extent they are trying to determine what contacts Enron and
its representatives had with the administration and what steps, if any,
administration officials took as a result.</TE>
<TE>   The refusal to make such disclosures has become entangled with the
long-running refusal to turn over to congressional investigators
requested information about the workings of Vice President Dick Cheney's
energy task force.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Thursday that in refusing to hand over documents about
the task force, the White House was honoring "a very important
principle," holding that it is "the right of the people in our country to
petition their government, to talk to their government. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "The suggestion that any contact with the government is somehow
sinister and, therefore, it should be examined . . . is a principle that
has big implications beyond what we're talking about today," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks Public's Help in Search for 5 From Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Terror: Officials say men in suicide videos may have been planning
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities warned the public Thursday to be on the lookout
for five Al Qaeda operatives who taped messages of martyrdom and may have
been planning terrorist acts against the United States.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. soldiers recently found videotapes of the men's suicide messages
in the rubble of a top Osama bin Laden lieutenant's home in Afghanistan,
suggesting a closer link than previously thought between Bin Laden and
his foot soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   One of the five suspected terrorists--Ramzi Binalshibh of Yemen--tried
unsuccessfully to enter the United States at least three times and is
wanted by Germany as an accomplice of the Sept. 11 hijackers. Authorities
have been unable to find him or the other four men in the declassified
videotapes that were released in abridged form Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Although authorities are uncertain when the five videotapes were made
or how Al Qaeda intended to use them, they "appear to be sort of
martyrdom messages from suicide terrorists. And whether or not the attack
would be imminent or not is something we can't determine," Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   "These men could be anywhere in the world," Ashcroft said. "We're not
able to say that they're in one location or another, or whether they're
dead or alive."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, authorities said the public should be on guard. The FBI is
hoping that release of the men's photographs and three of the videotapes
may produce tips leading to the suspects' capture. The sound was edited
out of the tapes, pending further translation work.</TE>
<TE>   In one videotape, an alleged Al Qaeda operative identified by the FBI
as Khalid Ibn Muhammad Al-Juhani is seen laughing and pressing his lips
to the end of a military-style rifle. Other men were identified as
Binalshibh, Abd Al-Rahim and Muhammad Said Ali Hasan. The fifth man in
the tapes has not been identified.</TE>
<TE>   German authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Binalshibh and
two alleged accomplices. U.S. authorities say Binalshibh was supposed to
be a hijacker in the Sept. 11 attacks but had been denied entry to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, FBI Director Robert Mueller and other officials have
characterized Binalshibh as being linked closely with alleged lead
hijacker Mohamed Atta--his former roommate in Hamburg, Germany--and other
hijackers. They also say Binalshibh wired money to some of the hijackers
when they were living in Florida and training for the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   When Zacarias Moussaoui, a 33-year-old Frenchman of Moroccan descent,
was indicted last month on charges of conspiring to kill and maim
Americans in the Sept. 11 plot, Binalshibh was named as a co-conspirator.
Justice Department officials say he could soon be indicted as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Moussaoui indictment describes how Binalshibh tried to enter the
United States repeatedly in an effort to obtain flight training and
participate in the Sept. 11 attacks. When he failed, authorities allege,
Moussaoui may have intended to take his place. They say Binalshibh wired
$14,000 to Moussaoui last summer while he was attending flight school in
Norman, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was arrested in August in Minnesota on immigration charges.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller called the tapes of Binalshibh and the four other men "part of
a trove of valuable information being recovered in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks since the Taliban was driven from power, U.S. troops and
intelligence operatives have found many pieces of evidence left behind in
caves, abandoned houses and bunkers throughout Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration official characterized the five videotapes as a
key advance in the U.S. government's knowledge of Al Qaeda and its role
in the Sept. 11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the tapes were found in the home of Mohammed Atef, a key
Bin Laden aide, "could mean that the chain of command between the actual
operatives [in the Sept. 11 attacks] and the leadership is shorter than
we thought, or that they move material up and down the chain a lot more
than we thought," said the administration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say Atef was killed in a November airstrike around
Kabul, Afghanistan's capital.</TE>
<TE>   FBI investigators are doing forensic tests and detailed translation
work on the videotapes in an effort to glean more insight into the men
and what they may have been planning. At the same time, the FBI, CIA,
Pentagon and other agencies are devoting more resources to the search for
evidence in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an intelligence gold mine that awaits us in Afghanistan,"
the administration official said. "We may stumble across critically
important material that will help thwart future attacks or help us put
together the pieces of the puzzle of how Al Qaeda operates that we did
not have before."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Benjamin, a counterterrorism expert and former National
Security Council aide in the Clinton administration, said authorities
need to pursue the chain of command between the five suspected terrorists
and Atef, Bin Laden's top military commander.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that [Atef] was very hands-on," Benjamin said. "He has been a
key link with operatives throughout the Al Qaeda organization. What we
don't know is how these tapes were being distributed, whether they were
being used for recruitment or some other informational purpose."</TE>
<TE>   After a brief lull in the Justice Department's terrorism
investigation, the release of the videotapes comes during a frenetic week
that has seen the filing of criminal charges against American Talib John
Walker Lindh and alleged "shoe bomber" Richard C. Reid.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in London, two Algerian men allegedly involved in a plot to
bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris were charged Thursday with being members
of Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terror network. Police said eight others were
arrested under Britain's Terrorism Act in raids north of London.</TE>
<TE>   Both of the Algerian men had been detained by immigration authorities
since their arrest Sept. 25 in Leicester, 100 miles north of London,
according to the Crown Prosecution Service.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests of the other eight men in Leicester were made "in
connection with an ongoing Pan-European anti-terrorist investigation,"
according to an official who asked not to be identified. British officers
were searching the raided premises Thursday, along with several other
addresses in Leicester and London, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "We do believe that progress is being made" in grounding Al Qaeda,
Ashcroft said. "But we have a long way to go. This is no time for us to
take our foot off the accelerator."</TE>
<TE>   However, one legal expert questioned whether Ashcroft's release of the
tapes and his urging of Americans to participate in identifying potential
hijackers could fuel harassment of Arab Americans and false
identifications by amateur sleuths.</TE>
<TE>   "One has to wonder how many men are going to be picked up or
identified from these pictures," said Jonathan Turley, a George
Washington University law professor. "The problem with saying these men
could be anywhere means that they will inevitably be found everywhere.
There is always the danger that release of these [tapes] could trigger a
'most wanted' frenzy by G-men wannabes."</TE>

<DL>QUETTA, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Once in a while, Sath Mohammed smiles. On this day it happens as
the 11-year-old describes his beloved sport, Afghan wrestling.</LD>
<LD>   The thought of it brings a look of delight to his face. He reaches an
arm into the air as if to grab an opponent. Then he moves a leg--or what
is left of it--and his face goes blank.</LD>
<LD>   For a moment, he had forgotten that he lies in bed No. 9 under a
crudely lettered sign that reads "Bomb Blast Victim" and will never
wrestle again.</LD>
<TE>   His left foot was blown off in late October when an errant U.S. bomb
hit the road where he and his sister were walking in Afghanistan's remote
Oruzgan province.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Sath reached Sandeman Civil Hospital here in Quetta, a
two-day journey, the Pakistani doctors felt there was no choice but to
take off the leg at the knee. Even then, they were not sure how he would
fare. He has no money for a prosthesis, and infection was still a
concern.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs antibiotics, he needs painkillers, and we don't have them,"
said Mohammed Ramzan, an orthopedic surgeon. "Maybe his family can buy
them in the bazaar."</TE>
<TE>   This is the human face of "collateral damage." It is hard enough for
families to deal with the tragedy of war's mistakes. But for Pakistan,
whose health system is impoverished, and for Afghanistan, whose legion of
destitute citizens Sath will soon rejoin, it is a Sisyphean task.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions at Sandeman, the largest Pakistani government hospital in
the area, illustrate the two countries' poverty as well as the
perseverance and limits of their medical staffs. Hospitals like this are
so poor that patients routinely are asked to buy medicine, bandages and
the orthopedic plates, pins and screws needed to set broken bones. Or
they go without.</TE>
<TE>   The dismal state of health care suggests that the international
community will face a mammoth effort as it tries to move the region into
the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "The real difficulty is that the Pakistani health system was
struggling anyway," said Anna Pont, health project manager here in
Baluchistan province for Mercy Corps International, an aid organization.
"There's been a lack of resources for years, the hospitals are running at
their limits, and there were a lot of Afghan refugees long before Sept
11.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to remember that while the people coming across
the border need help," Pont said, "the host country system needs a lot of
help to deal with the situation."</TE>
<TE>   The civilian victims of the U.S. bombing campaign are few, relative to
the number of Afghans sickened by diseases related to hunger and poverty.
International organizations that track such unintended casualties have
yet to complete their official estimates. But they say the number is
likely to be somewhat higher than the 1999 toll from allied airstrikes in
Yugoslavia, which human rights groups put at between 500 and 600 people.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, it appears that the bombing became more accurate, with
some exceptions, as the war went on and military planners received better
intelligence. Nonetheless, with so many injured in this and previous
Afghan wars, vast resources will be needed for patient rehabilitation as
well as basic medical care.</TE>
<TE>   To walk into Sandeman Civil Hospital is to enter a medical time warp.
There are no CT scans, no MRI machines, no centrifuges, no computers, no
electronic equipment. There is no monitoring equipment at the nurses'
stations, just dented plastic chairs.</TE>
<TE>   In the orthopedics wing, whose doctors' skills are widely recognized
in the region, there are no traction machines. Abdul Wasey, 10, who was
injured when a wall collapsed after a bombing in the Afghan city of
Kandahar, would be a natural candidate for traction, the application of
weights to hold bones in alignment.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb blast dislocated Abdul's hip, causing painful swelling and
making it impossible to walk. Such injuries are generally treated with
bandaging and traction.</TE>
<TE>   It's a relatively simple matter in the West. Not here. Doctors, after
searching for some way to rig weights, settled on two bricks, each a
little more than 2 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   But how to attach them to the boy? The doctors used a
turban--contributed by a patient with a head injury--to hold one brick. A
gauze bandage was rigged to hold the other. Abdul's father bought the
gauze at a shop because there was none to spare at Sandeman.</TE>
<TE>   For another patient, the doctors employed a full box of hard toffee.
The candy hung forlornly off the end of the bed, tied with a gauze bow
like a misplaced present.</TE>
<TE>Few Doctors, Many Mistakes</TE>
<TE>   On one day last month, Sath and Abdul were among 77 civilians injured
by the U.S. bombing who had made their way to Sandeman, according to
logbooks kept by the emergency room. A few died soon after arriving. For
the vast majority, the treatment they get at the hospital will determine
how they spend the rest of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the war, Sandeman received the most Afghan patients among
Pakistani hospitals. In part this was because of the intense U.S. bombing
in southern Afghanistan. Quetta is just a three-hour journey by vehicle
from the Afghan border and has a large number of refugees. Injured
Afghans often have a relative here who can help them navigate the health
care system.</TE>
<TE>   Sandeman also received patients referred by smaller and poorer
hospitals in Afghanistan, especially as doctors in that country fled the
fighting or were pressed into service treating Taliban soldiers. And
Sandeman is less costly than nearby private hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Medical insurance is rare in Pakistan and unknown in Afghanistan. Most
Pakistani hospitals rely on the meager funding they get from the
government and whatever patients can pay.</TE>
<TE>   In public hospitals like Sandeman, which see the poorest patients,
almost nothing is covered beyond the doctors' services. There also are
too few doctors.</TE>
<TE>   A government report on Baluchistan's hospitals found one doctor for
every 1,900 people. In Pakistan, the annual per capita expenditure on
health care is $18, according to 1999 statistics from the United Nations'
World Health Organization. In contrast, the annual health care
expenditure in the U.S. is more than $4,000 a person.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, when the Pakistani medical system ventures into
treatments that require technical expertise, mistakes are almost taken
for granted.</TE>
<TE>   Sath, the 11-year-old wrestling fan, was given three blood
transfusions, but at least two appear to have been with incompatible
blood types. His father, who spoke with an attending physician, was told
that his son was having "an allergic reaction." Western-trained doctors
in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, said his symptoms--a dark red rash that
covered his body and a feverish itching--were consistent with being given
an incompatible blood type. Such an error can be fatal, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Sath's father, a seller of plastic shoes, was already in debt for the
cost of reaching Quetta. He had to borrow still more to pay for medicine
needed to quell his son's reaction to the transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   Those who make their way to Sandeman for treatment come primarily from
rural backgrounds. These Afghans say they were unaware they lived near
Taliban troops, although after long conversation it may emerge that there
were antiaircraft guns positioned near their homes, or that Taliban
soldiers sometimes used nearby roads.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, many of them view the bombings as acts of God or nature.
"The bomb fell down on our house," they say, as if describing an
avalanche. In some cases, when they heard a helicopter flying low and
firing, they ran outside to see it, oblivious to the risk.</TE>
<TE>   These patients had little access at home to quick medical care or
knowledge to judge whether treatment was adequate. As a result, a number
of patients appear to have lingered in the more poorly equipped Kandahar
hospitals, possibly costing them a limb or a life.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside Afghanistan nowadays, the people are very poor," said Khair
Mohammed, who initially brought his injured 8-year-old granddaughter,
Saleema Bibi, to Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar for care.</TE>
<TE>   "We are farmers. We are working as daily laborers, and there is a
drought," he said. "I had no money, I could not afford to bring her to
Quetta, but I got a loan from a person in our village, and when we go
back I will work for him to pay him back."</TE>
<TE>'Where Is My Leg? Why Did They Take It?'</TE>
<TE>   Saleema's legs were crushed by a falling wall during a bombing. At
Sandeman, she was placed in the women's ward, a windowless room where
aunts and grandmothers squat on the floor next to their relatives,
heating water for tea on small kerosene stoves. The sheets on Saleema's
bed were stained with pus oozing from her wounds. In contrast with poorer
hospitals, Sandeman provides linen--washed a couple of times a week,
patients say--but no blankets or pillows.</TE>
<TE>   Ragai Bibi, Saleema's grandmother, fanned the flies that swarmed over
the girl, but there were too many to keep at bay. The older woman sleeps
on the floor unless there is a free bed. Her husband sleeps along with
other patients' male relatives outdoors in the hospital's main courtyard,
which serves as bedroom, dining room and mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Saleema arrived, Ramzan, the orthopedist, saw the severity
of her wounds. One leg was virtually severed. "This little girl needs an
amputation," he said. "All the bone is exposed; the muscles are exposed.
It's torn beyond healing."</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed her small foot and manipulated her toes, yellowish by then.</TE>
<TE>   "See, they are gangrenous and becoming dry," he said. "She has oozing
wounds. We tied the vessels, but they continue to bleed."</TE>
<TE>   Her grandparents opposed amputation, explaining that she would not be
able to work in the fields or kitchen if she lost a limb. Ramzan told
them that the infection could kill her. But they shook their heads. No,
she will get better, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The infection worsened, and eventually they gave permission for the
surgery. When she awoke from sedation, her eyes flickered as she became
conscious of the ache. Amputations cause some of the most searing pain a
person can experience, according to doctors. Then came something harder
than the pain itself.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is my leg? Why did they take it?" she asked, her voice
trembling, a look of terror on her face. She glanced over at her
grandmother and whispered: "What should I do now? Will they bring me a
new one?"</TE>
<TE>   Her grandmother fanned the flies and looked at a point on the far side
of the room. She saw the life that lay ahead for the little girl and her
face reflected a deep and terrible helplessness.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when Saleema fell into a feverish sleep, the grandmother's
words spilled out. This injury will affect their whole family, she said
angrily, and what did they do to deserve this? They are not Taliban. As
she sat on the floor, she put her head in her hands and rocked.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I think she will not be married because a man who is ready to
marry wants a wife who is able to serve him, to serve his mother, his
father, his complete family and care for his children," she said. "She is
lame and nobody will want to marry her. She has become a lifelong problem
for us."</TE>
<TE>   If Saleema and Sath and others hospitalized here are fortunate, some
international organization will help pay for a prosthesis. Mercy Corps
and one or two others offer such help. However, they usually require the
patients or their families to pay some share of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Sandeman is the only official government hospital for the injured
patients from Afghanistan," said Massoud Khazi, an orthopedist who is
proud that he was trained by an American physician in Quetta. "But if we
don't have the equipment, if we don't have the medicines, we cannot help
them as we should, we cannot do what we were trained to do."</TE>
<TE>   For Fatima, a young mother in the next bed, the clock was ticking.</TE>
<TE>   She had four to six weeks to get the screws and plates needed to set
her broken elbow before the bone would begin to heal improperly. Fatima,
who like many Afghans goes by one name, said she lost her husband and
five of her six children when they ran outside to see a low-flying
helicopter firing on their village. Her right arm was shattered by the
gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Khazi said only the insertion of screws and plates would help her
regain the use of her arm. "When we don't fix the fractures internally
[with pins], it disturbs the function of the whole limb," he said. "She
will not be able to use her hand and she will not be able to bend the arm
at the elbow. She will be lame."</TE>
<TE>   Already at the hospital for nearly four weeks, Fatima and her brother,
Sardar, were almost out of money. The cost of food and medicine had
overwhelmed Sardar, a farmer. Then the two vanished. Other patients said
they thought they had returned to Afghanistan. Fatima had not even
received a plaster cast.</TE>
<TE>   For Taj Mohammed, Sath's father, this latest trial has been almost
more than he can bear. A gentle man, he can't remember if he is 60 or 65.
He said life has been hard but in many ways happy. All of his children
are alive, and the family is often together, he said. In a country with
an infant mortality rate of about 1 in 5, that means something.</TE>
<TE>   Sath and his sister, Fermina, were injured as they were walking home
after visiting an elder sister. Fermina was burned and cut by the blast.
When Mohammed saw his children, bloodied and blackened from the blast, he
wept. Then he borrowed the money to bring them to the hospital in Quetta,
the best he could do for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this small boy and that small girl," he said. "He is not
Osama, and she is not Taliban. So why did America bombard them?"</TE>
<TE>   His hopes for Sath had been simple. "If he was well, he would work
with me," Mohammed said. "We would be able to sell shoes together, and he
would sell sweets to the small children to help me and my family make a
living. But now he cannot."</TE>
<TE>   Sath also had dreams. "I wanted to read and to work with my father,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   What will he do now? Sath turned his face to the grimy hospital wall.
His father looked out across the ward where the late afternoon light was
fading to gray and shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "He will have to go into the madrasa," or religious school, Mohammed
said. "Live in the mosque and pray for the people; pray for humanity."</TE>

<HD>Donations Could Taint Probe on Capitol Hill</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>None of the key congressional committees investigating Enron and
its former auditor, Andersen, could muster a majority at their hearings,
if campaign contributions from the powerful companies disqualified
members.</LD>
<LD>   And most of their chairmen couldn't participate.</LD>
<LD>   So great was the largess Enron and Andersen spread across party lines
on Capitol Hill during the last decade that 51 of the 56 members of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is taking the lead
investigative role, have received contributions.</LD>
<TE>   Together, the two companies' political action committees and employees
contributed more than $400,000 to the committee's members since 1990,
Federal Election Commission records show.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-nine of the 70 members of the House Financial Services
Committee, which held the first Enron hearings last month, have taken in
a total of $300,000 in contributions from Enron and Andersen in the last
decade.</TE>
<TE>   And two-thirds of the Senate committee that will open hearings into
Enron and Andersen next week shared in a total of more than $70,000 in
contributions from the targets of their investigation--including the
committee's chairman, Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   Enron's influence on the Hill extended beyond the contributions.
Several lawmakers or their wives owned stock in Enron or in mutual funds
that were heavily invested in Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems everybody on Capitol Hill got money from somebody--either
Andersen or Enron. So everyone's hands are dirty," said Holly Bailey, a
researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics, a government watchdog
group.</TE>
<TE>   As the effects of the Enron affair spread rapidly this week across
both parties, politicians were scrambling either to return contributions
or to donate them to former Enron employees who lost their life savings
in near-worthless company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's political action committee donated nearly $2 million in the
last four years--much of it to specific legislators and senators on the
committees that oversee the financial industry, according to Federal
Election Commission records. Enron contributed significantly more during
that period but favored "soft-money" donations to political parties and
their committees.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent, was among the handful of
members of Congress at the Dec. 12 Enron hearing who had not taken money
from either Enron or Andersen. He used the occasion to argue that the
committee's investigation should be expanded to include not just Andersen
but campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   "During the last two years, Enron has spent $4 million lobbying
Congress and the White House," he said. "Now what did Enron get in return
for the campaign contributions from the federal government? . . . There
is no question that Enron, through their political contributions and
influence, had an enormous impact on energy policy and the way this
government does business. That's wrong. It's got to be changed."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the House Financial Services Committee, Peggy
Peterson, said the contributions will have no effect on its
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to address this in a thorough and comprehensive way," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) ranks as the top House recipient of
Andersen's contributions--$47,000 since 1989, according to a compilation
by the Center for Responsive Politics. FEC records show that more than
half of that came in the last four years. Tauzin got an additional $6,400
from Enron over the 10-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, has been a
staunch advocate for Andersen, until last year known as Arthur Andersen.
He has become one of the most outspoken investigators of Enron and
Andersen since Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter if they give us a million bucks, it's not going to
cut either of these companies any slack," Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson
said Thursday. "If they thought this would buy them influence, they've
blown their money. Both Enron and Arthur Andersen are in line for a good
old-fashioned spanking."</TE>
<TE>   Fueling some skepticism is the recent track record of Tauzin's
committee. As recently as 2000, Tauzin and other committee members who
received Andersen contributions successfully fought back strict new
regulations proposed by then-Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Arthur Levitt.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen and its congressional advocates staunchly opposed the new SEC
rules, which would have barred accounting firms from doing both audit and
consultancy work for the same company--a dual role Andersen played at
Enron and one many critics have cited as a conflict of interest that
contributed to the company's collapse. That year, Andersen reportedly
received $52 million in combined fees from Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said Levitt's measure was premature.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we know there is a problem and now we're prepared to fix it," he
said. "Changes are coming, and we're going to support them."</TE>
<TE>   Although some members of Congress have pledged to donate their latest
Enron contributions to the company's fired employees or charity, Johnson,
speaking for Tauzin, said: "We're not giving away the contributions nor
recusing ourselves from the investigation. To do so would imply we had
done something unethical."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm is one of the Senate's largest recipients of Andersen
and Enron campaign contributions. His case helps show how deeply the two
companies and Congress are intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Republican's wife is an Enron board member who has been
served with a subpoena issued by the subcommittee of one of Gramm's
colleagues. Wendy Gramm is one of 51 people served with subpoenas issued
Friday by Sen. Carl Levin's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
Wendy Gramm also has been named in lawsuits against Enron alleging she
made a large profit on the early sale of her stock.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Gramm himself got $97,350 in campaign contributions from Enron
and an additional $73,850 from Andersen during the last decade. Gramm is
the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee, which announced this week that it too is investigating Enron
and Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said the senator, who announced his
retirement in September, is returning all contributions received for the
2002 elections, including those from Enron and Andersen. Earlier
contributions have already been spent, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Gramm will recuse himself in future Enron-Andersen
hearings, Neal said, "That's a judgment he'll have to make when he learns
the scope of the hearings."</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody connected to Enron was a high roller. Rep. Charles A.
Gonzalez, also a Texas Democrat, got a mere $500 from Enron and $1,000
from Andersen, but his wife owned Enron stock, which tanked last fall.
Gonzalez spokesman Adrian Saenz said the congressman's wife bought 65
shares of Enron at $64 each in 2000 and sold them in October for $36 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   But Saenz added that Gonzalez "is probably in a different position
than other members who received much larger contributions or had larger
investments in the companies."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Air's Purity a Matter of Dispute</HD>
<DH>Health: Many believe EPA was too quick to call it safe, and cite
indoor pollutants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>As New Yorkers choked and gagged under a cloud of smoky dust after
the World Trade Center attacks, the Environmental Protection Agency
constantly assured them that the air did not pose a major health risk.</LD>
<LD>   "EPA is greatly relieved to learn that there appears to be no
significant levels of asbestos in the air in New York City," said
Administrator Christie Whitman in a Sept. 13 message repeated many times.</LD>
<LD>   But now, amid growing scientific evidence of high asbestos levels in
homes and other potentially serious air quality problems related to the
attacks, many New Yorkers believe the EPA misled them and was perhaps too
eager to promote the return to business as usual in lower Manhattan.</LD>
<TE>   "The assurances we got from the EPA came from ignorance, and we do not
want to pay a terrible price in death and sickness down the road," Rep.
Jerrold Nadler (D-New York) said Thursday, joining federal, state and
local officials in a call for the EPA to clean up contaminants inside New
York homes and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Federal officials have only tested the air outside," he added. "They
couldn't possibly know if the city is really safe now."</TE>
<TE>   It was the latest outburst in an escalating debate over New York's
environmental health after Sept. 11. EPA officials deny they have
overlooked health needs, and in a statement Thursday the agency said it
has used "sound science" to chart the problem and "has undertaken an
unprecedented response to the terrorist attack on the World Trade
Center."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the criticism mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the fires and smoke at the trade center site disappeared,
there has been less concern over outdoor air quality and an increasing
focus on indoor contaminants. The agency's independent ombudsman has
called for a probe of Whitman's reassuring statements about air quality.
And a senior EPA chemist has charged that asbestos levels in New York
homes pose a health risk equal to that of Libby, Mont., a mining town so
contaminated it has been declared a U.S. Superfund site.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, parents are rebelling against Board of Education orders to
return their children in three weeks to public elementary schools near
ground zero, saying they won't go back until they are convinced the air
is safe.</TE>
<TE>   An unprecedented study has been launched to test pregnant women who
were exposed to the clouds of gas and smoke at the World Trade Center,
and health testing has also begun for hundreds of day laborers who have
been working at the site without adequate respiratory protection.</TE>
<TE>   While there is no hard scientific evidence that New Yorkers are in
danger from contamination, many observers say federal officials failed to
properly communicate the level of medical risk to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "All along, the EPA and other departments have been assuring people in
New York City that things were fine, but things were not fine," said Dr.
Stephen Levin, medical director of Mount Sinai Hospital's Center for
Occupational and Environmental Medicine. "There was a great desire to
resume business as usual here, and I do mean business, because there's a
great push to commercially redevelop the [World Trade Center] site."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the controversy has focused on asbestos testing. When the
World Trade Center towers collapsed, a large but still undetermined
amount of asbestos used in the original building construction rained down
on Manhattan. The site was only partially lined with the cancer-causing
fireproofing material, because New York outlawed its use in 1971 while
the buildings were under construction.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts believe that the force of the airplane blast pulverized
the asbestos into particles smaller than those normally identified by
detection equipment. And while rigorous EPA tests suggest the outside air
at the site is free of dangerous contamination, several private studies
using more sophisticated technology have shown higher levels of asbestos
and other contaminants in the smaller dust particles that blew into homes
and offices near the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   The tests, by HP Environmental Inc. of Herndon, Va., and Chatfield
Technical Consulting, a Canadian firm, could not determine whether those
exposed to the minute particles would develop any potentially fatal
diseases. Typically, individuals must be exposed to asbestos for long
periods of time, and the disease may not appear for 20 years or more.</TE>
<TE>   "We found conditions that EPA inspectors may not have suspected," said
Hugh Granger, who directed the HP Environmental study. "And we don't want
to alarm people, but this kind of information should be widely known."</TE>
<TE>   Under EPA guidelines, 70 fibers of asbestos per square millimeter
calls for decontamination procedures in schools. In the HP study, several
indoor samples showed more than 300 fibers per square millimeter.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials have said they do not regulate the interior of people's
homes, and that the responsibility for enforcing such cleanup rests
mainly with the city's health department. But the health department has
come under heavy fire for advising people to clean up potentially
dangerous particles of airborne asbestos with wet rags, mops and other
crude home equipment, instead of the costly and more effective vacuums
used at other sites.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the debate, Levin and other experts urge calm. While he said
there had been an "unexpectedly high" number of respiratory complaints
from New Yorkers, especially among office workers and people who lived
near the site, he believes health dangers are greatly abating.</TE>
<TE>   "The fires at the site are out and the risks are diminishing," he told
parents from Public School 150 at a meeting this week to decide whether
they should return to the school, six blocks from the World Trade Center
site. The school and several others were evacuated after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Levin pointed to recent air quality tests at the school, indicating
that levels of asbestos, lead and other contaminants did not pose a
danger to students. Given all the information that is now available, he
said he would not have a problem sending his children back to school near
the disaster site.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some parents were not convinced and asked pointed questions: Is
there an air quality problem caused by trucks filled with trade center
debris that rumble past the school? Is it safe for youngsters to play
outside for 45 minutes at recess so close to the site? And what about the
contaminated dust particles that may be tracked into the school by
children playing outside?</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the meeting, parents were still wrestling with the
question, but they clearly resented the Board of Education's edict that
their children and students of other schools had to return to their
original campuses by Feb. 4. Earlier, parents at nearby Public School 89,
citing health concerns, voted against returning.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't know who to believe in the government anymore," said
one angry mother, preparing to leave the meeting in the cafeteria of the
Greenwich Village school where Public School 150 students have been
temporarily housed since the attacks. "I don't think federal people told
us the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Those concerns prompted Robert J. Martin, the EPA's national
ombudsman, to call for an inquiry into Whitman's assurances about air
quality. Martin, who has called for 35 investigations into EPA actions
over the years, is waging a court battle against Whitman's effort to
dissolve his job at the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt there was something rotten in Denmark," said Hugh Kauffman,
Martin's chief investigator. "I don't want anyone to be scared [about
asbestos levels], but we need to find out what exactly she [Whitman] knew
when she made these comments, and how forthcoming the agency was."</TE>
<TE>   Yet another charge has been lodged by Cate Jenkins, an EPA chemist,
who has performed a risk assessment study of reported asbestos levels in
New York homes, and found the city has a level comparable to that of
Libby, Mont., where hundreds of people died of asbestos poisoning from
nearby mines.</TE>
<TE>   She cautioned, however, that her analogy to Libby is a projection. It
is not based on epidemiological studies, which rely on medical histories
to chart the onset of diseases and the conditions that caused them.</TE>
<TE>   "If EPA doesn't call for uniform, proper cleanups in these Manhattan
homes, the risks will be very high down the line for people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, researchers at Columbia University's School of Public
Health and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine are launching a study that
will track the effect of the terrorist attacks on 300 pregnant women.
They want to know what chemicals and metals these individuals were
exposed to, and whether they contribute to any health problems in the
mothers or their children.</TE>
<TE>   David Newman, an industrial hygienist with the New York Coalition on
Occupational Safety and Health, said, "We need to make it clear that not
everybody will get ill in New York or has been exposed to something bad.</TE>
<TE>   "But people get concerned, sometimes to the point of hysteria, if we
don't have a coordinated governmental response to the problem and what
people should do. In New York, that's been sorely missing."</TE>

<HD>Tale of Chinese Scandal Backfires on Magazine</HD>
<DH>Media: Financial weekly makes an obsequious apology for accusing a
top national leader's family of impropriety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>A magazine that accused the family of China's No. 2 leader of
improper business practices has become embroiled in political controversy
months before a key government reshuffle later this year.</LD>
<LD>   A brief but daring article in Securities Market Weekly, a prominent
Beijing-based publication, implied that the wife and son of former
Premier Li Peng used their connections to turn a Chinese power company
into a family fiefdom able to muscle its way onto the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   In ironic tones, the article described Li Xiaopeng, the former
premier's son, as the "helmsman" of Huaneng Power International and his
mother, Zhu Lin, as the "captain" of one of Huaneng's parent companies.</LD>
<TE>   The article suggested that the mother and son parlayed their
connections into a "miraculous" rise in Huaneng's fortunes as one of only
a few firms to achieve listings on three different bourses, in Shanghai,
Hong Kong and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The story appeared in the magazine's Nov. 24 issue, buried on Page 42.
But it sparked an official backlash that forced the magazine to run a
lengthy, obsequious apology days later. The article "seriously slandered"
Zhu and the younger Li, damaged Huaneng's reputation and "created an
extremely harmful influence," the apology said.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy comes in advance of this fall's 16th Communist Party
Congress, in which China's top jobs will be reassigned.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations were apparently serious enough to prompt Zhu to grant
a rare interview to another publication, in which she denied any
involvement with Huaneng. Her son, however, is indeed chairman of the
company, which is China's largest independent power producer, according
to its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never been general manager or president of any companies," Zhu
said to a reporter from China's Talents magazine. "I don't have a single
cent of stock, nor any illegal bonds. I do not oppose buying and selling
stocks, but I don't have such ability myself."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors have swirled among the increasingly feisty state-run media that
Zhu was incensed enough by the accusations in Securities Market Weekly to
fire off a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, saying that even the
Nationalists were better at controlling the media while in power in the
1930s and '40s than the Communist government appears to be now.</TE>
<TE>   All copies of the offending issue of Securities Market Weekly have
since been withdrawn, its publisher said. References to the story and
ensuing dust-up appear to have been excised from Chinese Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   The story's author, Ma Hailin, has been identified as a member of the
People's Armed Police force who has written many articles about economics
and finance in China. Reports that Ma has been arrested for his incaution
could not be confirmed. Others say the magazine barely escaped closure,
spared mostly because of the influence of its top brass. Editors at the
weekly declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The flap has put other media outlets on notice not to cross the line
in reporting on the country's leaders, especially amid the political
tightening of social control in advance of the fall congress.</TE>
<TE>   A writer at another magazine said her boss called a meeting to tell
his staff to be careful, warning: "Don't get me in trouble, because I
don't have the same kind of clout as the other publisher." Another
journalist at a national newspaper said his editor did the same. Both
journalists requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   With the party congress months away, many analysts are on the lookout
for possible signs of feuding and jockeying among the nation's
leadership. Trying to discredit rivals by attacking their proxies or
family members is a common political tactic in China.</TE>
<TE>   In the Securities Market Weekly story, some observers detect a whiff
of the battle between reformers allied with Premier Zhu Rongji and
conservatives associated with Li Peng, who was the chief force behind the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and who remains a deeply unpopular figure.
The weekly magazine comes under the aegis of China's Securities Exchange
Executive Council, considered friendly to Zhu.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, an agency headed by one of Zhu's allies, the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, approved Huaneng's listing on the
Shanghai stock market. The listing occurred Dec. 6, two weeks after the
controversial article.</TE>
<TE>   "This is certainly a juicy story," said Bruce Dickson, professor of
political science and international affairs at George Washington
University. "What is most frustrating is that we don't really know the
motivations behind it, but we will probably see more like it in the
months to come if the top leaders are still haggling over appointments
and pecking order of the new batch of leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Li Peng, who is chairman of the Chinese legislature, and his family
have long been identified with China's power industry. A Soviet-trained
hydroelectric engineer, Li was minister of power in the early 1980s and
before that worked at several regional power plants and bureaus. His wife
has also worked in the power industry.</TE>
<TE>   But rumors of her involvement in Huaneng, which operates 13 power
plants across China and generated $1.5 billion in sales and revenue last
year, "malign me viciously," Zhu Lin told China's Talents.</TE>
<TE>   She is not the first high-profile wife to defend herself from
allegations of impropriety or corruption. Two years ago, the wife of
Beijing party boss and Politburo member Jia Qinglin went on Hong Kong
television to dismiss reports that she was implicated in one of the
biggest smuggling scandals in modern Chinese history.</TE>
<TE>   China's leaders are extremely sensitive to public anger over official
corruption and complaints that relatives of the powerful have enriched
themselves on the strength of their connections.</TE>
<TE>   The government publicizes hundreds of anti-corruption probes every
year but quashes any hint of scandal reaching to the very top.</TE>

<HD>Poland Expects to Capitalize on Closer Links With Russia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW
</DL>
<LD>After meeting with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday,
Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller confidently predicted that Poland
will benefit economically from their two countries' warming political
ties.</LD>
<LD>   It is a hope shared widely in Polish society: In recent years, sales
to Russia have dropped off sharply, while energy imports are high,
resulting in a $3-billion trade deficit last year, one-quarter of
Poland's total trade gap. Cutting that deficit by selling more to Russia
could create jobs in Poland, where unemployment is running at 17%.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope we're going to have better economic cooperation with Russia,
just like the newspapers say," pensioner Henryk Nestorowicz, 62, said
when asked his view of Putin's visit. He suggested that textile and
furniture sales to Russia, strong in the days when Poland was part of the
Soviet bloc, might revive.</LD>
<TE>   The focus of Putin's diplomacy Thursday was on encouraging--and
perhaps even realizing--some of those hopes. He discussed knotty economic
issues with Miller in Warsaw, then flew to the western Polish city of
Poznan to attend a trade fair before returning to Moscow. Putin was
accompanied in both cities by a delegation of 150 Russian businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics argue that Poland is expecting far too much from the two-day
visit.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider the general tone of Polish commentaries on the Putin visit
to be simple wishful thinking," prominent analyst Rafal Ziemkiewicz wrote
in Thursday's Rzeczpospolita, a leading newspaper. "This constant
repetition that we count on normalizing economic relations with Russia
makes no sense at all, because one can have normal economic relations
only with a normal country. Russia is not and does not intend to be a
normal country in our meaning of the word."</TE>
<TE>   Russia is a country of "not individualism but collectivism, not
democracy but authoritarian rule, not human rights and the government
serving its citizens, but subjugation of the individual to the state,"
Ziemkiewicz continued. "What results is not capitalism motivated
exclusively by profit, but a directed economy, subordinated like all
other spheres of life to the interests of the state."</TE>
<TE>   Russia's attitude toward Poland is still that of an imperial power,
Ziemkiewicz argued, predicting that its goal is for economic cooperation
to be "a tool making Poland dependent on Russia and building here a
pro-Moscow lobby." The period of Poland's "best economic ties with
Russia," he added, came in the 19th century when one-third of the country
was under direct Russian rule.</TE>
<TE>   Before Putin's visit, efforts were made to hammer out an investment
protection accord between the two countries, to agree on a route for a
second pipeline to take Russian natural gas to Western Europe, and to
reach a deal on reducing Poland's commitment to buy natural gas. Poland
wants to revise a 25-year natural-gas contract signed in 1995, at a time
when it overestimated its needs. But no agreement was reached in any of
these areas.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said Thursday that to push cooperation forward, the prime
ministers of the two countries will hold twice-yearly talks focused on
economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the rise in Poland's trade deficit with Russia "very
disquieting," Miller said the two sides agreed it could be brought down
by Polish exports not only of goods but also of services.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility broached in Poznan on Thursday was the participation
of Polish firms in Russian construction projects--particularly in the
Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad, which abuts northern Poland.</TE>
<TE>   Poland's deficit with Russia "is no cause for joy for us," Putin said
in Poznan. "We would like our trade to be in balance."</TE>
<TE>   During Putin's visit, there have been a few scattered protests against
Russia's policy toward its rebellious republic of Chechnya. Before his
arrival in Poznan on Thursday, police detained 40 people who tried to
unfurl anti-Russian banners outside the trade fair grounds in defiance of
a ban on demonstrations.</TE>

<LD>About 45 people were killed and hundreds of thousands fled eastern
Congo after a volcano erupted Thursday. The devastating lava flow forced
many into neighboring Rwanda.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. officials in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, estimated the number of
dead at 45, as lava poured down the slopes of Mt. Nyiragongo.</LD>
<LD>   Overnight, the horizon was one long stretch of flames and smoke.</LD>
<TE>   In Gisenyi, just across the border from Congo, displaced people lined
the roadsides, lying down to sleep anywhere they could find a patch of
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Military sources in Gisenyi said as many as 300,000 people may have
fled across the border to Rwanda. By daybreak today, the volcano appeared
to have quieted.</TE>

<LD>North Korea may be rebuilding a railroad leading to South Korea
that was destroyed during the 1950-53 Korean War, the South Korean
government said.</LD>
<LD>   The semiofficial Yonhap news agency said the Defense Ministry had
observed the North Koreans building barracks and moving construction
troops near the destroyed railroad. A pledge to rebuild the railroad was
part of an agreement struck in June 2000 when South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung visited the North's capital, Pyongyang. But the reconciliation
process broke down last year.</LD>
<LD>   A South Korean government official said North Korea needs to repair
eight miles of railroad for the train link to be restored.</LD>

<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia
</DL>
<LD>Philippine police arrested three men suspected of links to the Al
Qaeda terrorist network and seized a ton of explosives Thursday, acting
on a tip from authorities in Singapore who recently broke up a terror
ring there.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests in the southern Philippine city of General Santos came as
U.S. troops began setting up camp less than 200 miles away to assist the
Philippine military in combating an Islamic separatist band of kidnappers
that has been holding two American hostages.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests and the discovery of a weapons cache indicate that a
terrorist network connected with Al Qaeda has been operating secretly for
some time in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.</LD>
<TE>   About 650 U.S. troops are moving into the southern Philippines to
train and assist government soldiers in maneuvers aimed at destroying Abu
Sayyaf guerrillas operating on Basilan island. Some allege that the Abu
Sayyaf also has links to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine government has billed the joint military operation as
an "exercise" but acknowledges that it could last up to a year and that
U.S. military personnel could take part in combat despite a
constitutional ban on foreign troops engaging in military activity.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo insisted this week that
the role of U.S. troops in the war games is legal and that their
assistance could help eliminate the Abu Sayyaf.</TE>
<TE>   "We might finally crush the Abu Sayyaf [during the exercises]," she
told reporters. "I am willing to weather the criticism because we'll
succeed in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf has held U.S. missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham
hostage since May. The group is also holding Philippine nurse Deborah
Yap.</TE>
<TE>   There was no indication whether the three suspects arrested Thursday
on the island of Mindanao have any links to the Abu Sayyaf or to other
Islamic separatist groups that have long fought the government in the
southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities didn't identify the three arrested men or provide
information about them, although they are all apparently Filipinos.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine police said they had dug up a variety of weapons, including
17 M-16s, bomb-making materials and detonators, from the yard of a house
that the suspects were using.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrests were the result of information from Singaporean
authorities about the possible presence in the Philippines of
personalities connected with Al Qaeda," national police spokesman Gen.
Cresencio Maralit told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery in Southeast Asia of a well-developed Al Qaeda network
called Jemaah Islamiah has come as a shock to many, especially in the
authoritarian city-state of Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen people allegedly connected to the group have been arrested in
Singapore since early December and ordered held without trial for at
least two years under the island nation's Internal Security Act. Eight of
the 13 received training in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, authorities
say.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities say the plotters had made plans to attack a
variety of U.S. targets.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen other people have been arrested since December in Malaysia in
the breakup of a related terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in both countries allege that the groups were led by two
Indonesian clerics, Abu Bakar Bashir and Hambali, who like many
Indonesians goes by one name. Indonesian police have questioned Bashir
about the charges but have not taken action against him. Hambali's
whereabouts is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on the information from Singapore, the Philippine police dug up
the weapons cache, which included 50 cartons of TNT.</TE>
<TE>   Markings on cylinders containing the TNT indicated that they were made
in the Philippines. Police also found 300 detonators.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said there were enough explosives to destroy a block of
houses.</TE>
<TE>   "Investigators are still determining the suspects' possible links to
the dreaded Al Qaeda terrorist group," the Philippine police said in a
statement.</TE>

<HD>Powell Reassures Worried Afghans</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The secretary of State visits Kabul to tell leaders, 'We
will be with you.' His trip is to include a donors conference in Tokyo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell promised worried Afghans on
Thursday that the United States won't leave them in the lurch, vowing to
play a key role in the reconstruction of their country long after the war
against the Taliban and the Al Qaeda terror network ends.</LD>
<LD>   The highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Kabul, the Afghan capital,
since then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger in 1976, Powell met with
interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai and several members of his Cabinet to
discuss the ongoing war effort and the arduous rebuilding of the
shattered country.</LD>
<LD>   "In all our meetings with the Afghan people, they ask us: 'Is the
United States committed? Will they stay with us?' " Karzai said at a news
conference here. "Now I can tell them, 'Yes. The U.S. will stay with us.'
"</LD>
<TE>   Powell quickly concurred. "We will be with you in this current
crisis," he said, "and for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Powell flew from Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, to Bagram air base
north of Kabul early Thursday, then took an Army Chinook helicopter into
the Afghan capital. He arrived at the presidential palace under extremely
tight security, with a helicopter gunship covering his route through the
city and warplanes patrolling overhead.</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair flew into Bagram earlier this month
for a meeting with Karzai. But on the advice of his security team, he
didn't go on to Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, dressed in a bright-green robe and his traditional Afghan hat,
went out of his way Thursday to thank Powell for taking the "risk to come
here."</TE>
<TE>   Powell's whirlwind visit to Afghanistan was sandwiched between trips
to Pakistan and India.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he met in Islamabad with President Pervez Musharraf.
After meeting with Afghan officials in Kabul on Thursday, he flew on to
New Delhi in an effort to moderate tensions between India and Pakistan
over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   India insists that it will not withdraw several hundred thousand
troops from its border with Pakistan, and along the cease-fire line
dividing Kashmir, until it is convinced that Pakistan is acting on a
promise to stop terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   One of India's key demands is for Pakistan to hand over 20 men wanted
on terrorism and other criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>Encouraging Signs</TE>
<TE>   Although he didn't report any breakthroughs after a working dinner
with Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh on Thursday night, Powell
sounded encouraged by recent developments. The secretary of State said he
had been told that India is sending Pakistan more details about the 20
suspects, as authorities in Islamabad requested.</TE>
<TE>   When Musharraf, a general who took power in a bloodless 1999 coup,
announced tough new measures against Islamic extremists Saturday, he left
open the possibility that he would deliver those on the wanted list who
are Indian citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "In my conversations with him, [Musharraf] did not rule this out,"
Powell said. "He considered that appropriate action might involve
returning them from whence they came."</TE>
<TE>   Indian authorities have said about 14 of the suspects are Indian
nationals, but some of those are believed to have become Pakistani
citizens or fled the country. Among the least politically risky for
Musharraf to extradite are several Sikh separatists accused of terrorist
attacks during a failed campaign to carve out an independent state called
Khalistan.</TE>
<TE>   But India won't easily settle for anyone less than Maulana Masood
Azhar, head of Jaish-e-Mohammed, one of the Pakistani-based groups
fighting Indian forces in Kashmir. India says the group is one of two
behind the Dec. 13 attack on its Parliament that killed 14 people,
including the five gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists may have struck again Thursday night with a bomb blast in a
crowded market in Jammu, the winter capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir
state. The explosion killed one person and injured 10, but police did not
immediately lay blame.</TE>
<TE>   After the assault on Parliament, India responded by massing troops on
its border with Pakistan, leading to a dangerous face-off between the two
nuclear powers that Powell is trying to talk back from the brink.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld urged the two
countries Thursday to back away from their standoff. Speaking to
reporters after talks with his Indian counterpart, George Fernandes,
Rumsfeld said the tension between the two nations is "unhelpful to them,
unhelpful to the world."</TE>
<TE>   A series of meetings between Rumsfeld and Fernandes and their top
aides in recent months is designed to reassure India that the new U.S.
partnership with Pakistan, India's archrival, will not come at India's
expense, and to remind New Delhi that it has a long-term interest in
staying on America's good side, a senior U.S. military official said.</TE>
<TE>   In New Delhi, Powell said he had "shared some ideas" with the Indian
foreign minister on possible ways to resolve the crisis with Pakistan and
will bring them up again in a scheduled meeting today with Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.</TE>
<TE>   Powell did not reveal details of his suggestions, saying he wanted to
share them with Indian officials first.</TE>
<TE>   After he leaves India, Powell's schedule takes him to Nepal, then on
to Tokyo on Monday for an international "pledging conference" at which
Afghanistan will make a pitch for upward of $10 billion over the next
decade to help with rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has placed its promised $1 million in an emergency
start-up fund, Powell said, but he declined to specify how much the U.S.
will pledge in Tokyo. "In keeping with American tradition," he said, "as
the collection plate is passed, the United States will make a significant
contribution."</TE>
<TE>Karzai Is Confident</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, who will travel to Washington on Jan. 28 for meetings with
President Bush, told reporters his country will be able to deal
responsibly with massive cash infusions, despite the lack of a state bank
and a long history of corruption by government officials and warlords.</TE>
<TE>   A British-led peacekeeping force in Kabul has begun nighttime patrols,
inspections of police stations and other new missions. The International
Security Assistance Force, as it is known, has no U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the two men had discussed a future role for American troops
in the country, Powell said that for the time being, the U.S. military is
limiting its activities in Afghanistan to hunting Al Qaeda and Taliban
forces.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to leave any contamination behind," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Criticize New Baggage Screening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Two leading House Democrats say the Transportation Department's
plan for tougher airline baggage inspections, scheduled to begin today,
falls short of what a post-Sept. 11 law requires.</LD>
<LD>   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and James Oberstar
of Minnesota, top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee,
objected to Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta's announcement
Wednesday that airlines would meet the congressionally ordered deadline
in many cases by refusing to load luggage unless the passenger also
boards.</LD>
<LD>   "This decision amounts to a narrow interpretation of the statute and
flouts the intent of a law designed to fundamentally change the air
safety rules of our country," Gephardt said. "I'm afraid the secretary's
announcement is little more than a perpetuation of the status quo."</LD>
<TE>   The two lawmakers said the law passed by Congress and signed by
President Bush in November requires bags to be screened for explosives.
But only some luggage will be checked with explosives detection machines,
bomb-sniffing dogs, hand searches by security agents, or hand-held
equipment that detects traces of explosives.</TE>
<TE>   As an alternative to actual inspections, airlines can use a
passenger-bag match--a strategy in which no bag will be loaded on an

<HD>Relatives Rally to Protest 9/11 Fund</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Angered by proposed rules governing a new federal compensation
fund, about 850 relatives of those killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks demanded at a rally here Thursday night that the program be
modified to allow more people to collect larger awards.</LD>
<LD>   "Some people have described us as greedy, but we are not here tonight
because we are greedy," said Anthony Gardner, head of the World Trade
Center United Family Group, a band of relatives who have joined together
to press their demands. "Our hope is to inform the public of the
program's major deficiencies."</LD>
<LD>   The protesters want Kenneth Feinberg, a special master appointed to
decide how much each family gets from the U.S. Treasury, to reconsider
the rules he announced before Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   They want to ensure that the formula used for calculating economic
loss is fair and takes into consideration the high cost of living in New
York. They also want Feinberg to increase the $250,000 allotted for the
pain and suffering of the victims and to make sure nobody ends up without
anything.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of the criticism was leveled at a rule requiring beneficiaries
to sign away their rights to sue before finding out how much money they
would receive.</TE>
<TE>   "Where in America are families required to sign away their rights
before they know what they have coming to them?" New York Gov. George
Pataki, one of the speakers Thursday night, asked the crowd in a National
Guard armory.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican governor's remarks about the horrors suffered in the
terrorist attacks stirred memories that brought tears to the eyes of many
of the audience.</TE>
<TE>   New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg assured the crowd that the city
would not walk away from its obligations to the families.</TE>
<TE>   The relatives gathered in somber, orderly queues Thursday night to
sign petitions demanding changes in the rules proposed by Feinberg. Many
of them scribbled down suggestions about how those changes should be
worded.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Victims' Compensation Fund was created by an act of
Congress on Sept. 22 as part of an effort to bail out the airlines.
Congress has allotted $15 billion to help the airlines; estimates were
that the families would receive about $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   When he first announced the program, Feinberg estimated that the
average award would be $1.6 million. But groups of victims' families have
since pointed out that that figure does not include several deductions
proposed by Feinberg. After calculating what they might get, some
families became furious.</TE>
<TE>   For example, families of rescue workers who have generous death
benefits would have those benefits deducted from their awards and get
nothing. Many stockbrokers who were earning high salaries would be at a
disadvantage because the guidelines seem to put a cap on annual salaries
at $231,000.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those people also had large life insurance policies and ample
pensions that would be deducted from their awards under the rules
proposed by Feinberg.</TE>
<TE>   Several groups of families have banded together to make sure a
memorial is built at the trade center site and to help return the remains
of the dead to the families.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg was appointed in late November to manage the compensation
program. After consulting with many groups of families, lawyers and
financiers, he announced his guidelines. He has until Tuesday to take
comments. Then he is expected to modify the guidelines, probably by the
end of next month, and start taking claim applications.</TE>

<LD>Today's planned reopening of the Hart Senate office building was
postponed for at least a day as tests for anthrax were performed on a bag
of cleanup gear found in a hallway ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   The building, across the street from the Capitol, was to reopen at
noon to the public and Senate staffs. It has been shuttered since Oct.
17, two days after an anthrax-laden letter was opened there in the suite
of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</LD>
<LD>   An initial test for anthrax on the bag's contents was negative and
final results were expected today, said Capitol Police spokesman Lt. Dan
Nichols.</LD>

<LD>The New York Fire Department said it will consider other designs
for a Sept. 11 memorial after being criticized for its first choice--a
statue based on a photograph of three firefighters raising a U.S. flag
whose ethnicities were altered.</LD>
<LD>   The property-management company that owns the Fire Department
headquarters building in Brooklyn had already commissioned the work
inspired by the photograph.</LD>
<LD>   The bronze, 19-foot statue cost $180,000 and was to be erected this
spring.</LD>
<TE>   The three men in the photograph are white. The statue depicts
firefighters who are black, white and Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters called the statue political correctness run amok and an

<HD>Fairness Urged for Detainees in Cuba</HD>
<DH>Response: Red Cross and U.N. leaders call for Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighters held at Guantanamo Bay to be treated as POWs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>As the Red Cross prepared to interview suspected Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters held in Cuba, U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson
urged the United States on Thursday to treat the prisoners according to
international law and not to "fudge or blur the edges."</LD>
<LD>   "It is extremely important that the legal status of those detained in
Guantanamo Bay is clarified," said Robinson, a former president of
Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   "They were combatants in an international conflict. It may be that
some of them have also been involved in the Al Qaeda conspiracy, that's
quite likely, but they are entitled to POW status or, if that is
defeated, there is provision in the Geneva Convention that it goes before
a tribunal," she said at a conference in Dublin, the Irish capital.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. government calls the prisoners "unlawful combatants" and says
they are not guaranteed rights under the 1949 Geneva Convention covering
prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   International Committee of the Red Cross officials were expected to
hold private interviews with the prisoners today. A spokesman for the Red
Cross said the organization also believed the detainees ought to be
treated as prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, America's closest ally in Europe, concern has grown this
week over treatment of the prisoners at Guantanamo.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Tony Blair has backed the U.S. position, but he is
under pressure from members of his party and the opposition to ensure
that the Guantanamo prisoners--including three British citizens--are
treated humanely.</TE>
<TE>   The Church of England issued a plea Thursday for the United States to
treat the prisoners with "humanity and dignity" and to apply
"proportionate and measured" justice.</TE>
<TE>   "Every action must be tested against principles of justice," bishops
said after a three-day gathering of the House of Bishops in York,
England.</TE>
<TE>   "Ends do not justify means. Those who proclaim that their cause is
just must act justly."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told the British Broadcasting
Corp. on Wednesday that he does not "feel the slightest concern about
[the prisoners'] treatment." They are being treated vastly better than
they treated anybody else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Guardian newspaper columnist Hugo Young responded that there was "a
sense of generalized vengeance in what Rumsfeld had to say. Having failed
to catch Osama bin Laden, the U.S. is evidently adopting the alternative
of netting any number of Taliban and Al Qaeda and sticking them with
collective responsibility for the monstrous mass murder at the Pentagon
and World Trade Center."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Blair faced a grilling from members of his own Labor
Party and the opposition in Parliament over the prisoners' treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Labor's Kevin McNamara warned the prime minister that the West was in
"danger of losing the high moral ground."</TE>
<TE>   Blair agreed that prisoners must be treated humanely. He defended U.S.
actions, repeating official assertions that the prisoners were being fed
properly and allowed exercise and showers, and adding that they were
"highly dangerous people."</TE>
<TE>   Liberal Democratic leader Charles Kennedy said the West must seek a
better standard of behavior than the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "We must demonstrate that our values remain above those who seek to
destroy them," Kennedy said.</TE>

<HD>In Appalachia, an Unlikely Setting for a Triple Murder</HD>
<DH>Crime: The close-knit community peacefully coexisted with rural law
school. Slain dean was known as caring, helpful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRUNDY, Va.
</DL>
<LD>It was an unlikely place for the two to meet, in the gritty heart
of Appalachia.</LD>
<LD>   L. Anthony Sutin was a high-ranking Justice Department official, a
Harvard-trained constitutional scholar.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Odighizuwa was a father of four and a former cabdriver from
Nigeria, trying to start over.</LD>
<TE>   Sutin had just taken a job as dean of the Appalachian School of Law,
an ambitious project aimed at improving legal services in one of the most
downtrodden areas of the South. Odighizuwa was one of his students.</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, Sutin was there for him. When Odighizuwa was broke,
the dean helped buy him a car and a computer and found him a job bagging
groceries. When Odighizuwa flunked out of law school his first year,
Sutin gave him a second chance and let him back in.</TE>
<TE>   Now Sutin is dead. And Odighizuwa is in a mountainside jail, charged
with murder.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of all the people who tried to help him, that's who Peter killed
first--execution-style," law student Chuck Scherer said. "It's bothering
us all."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a day after police said Odighizuwa killed the dean, a law
professor and a classmate in a 60-second shooting spree, a few clues
emerged as to what led to the fatal collision between the student and the
dean.</TE>
<TE>   Court records revealed that Odighizuwa, 43, had a violent past, and
classmates said he behaved erratically. He was charged in August with
hitting his wife in the face and often was moody and depressed.</TE>
<TE>   As he was led into the courtroom, Odighizuwa, with his head down and
hands and legs shackled, yelled out: "I've been sick! I've been sick! I
need help!"</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, after 12 charges had been leveled against him,
prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Many people in Grundy, a coal mining town best known for its fierce
high school wrestlers, have been ambivalent about the private law school,
which opened five years ago in a converted junior high school. Its
founders hoped to bring legal services--and a sense of hope--to a
historically depressed area.</TE>
<TE>   "People said it'll help bring jobs," former coal miner Fred McCracken
said. "But I always thought that if you mixed up too many people in a
little town, something's going to happen. It just don't slide."</TE>
<TE>   Often in rural areas, locals and college folks don't mix, but for
Sutin, 42, that wasn't the case.</TE>
<TE>   He'd walk his dog through downtown, past the abandoned movie theater
and bronze statue of a coal miner. He'd play T-ball with his son and
other boys and their fathers along the Levisa River. And come Sunday,
even though he was Jewish, he'd often go to church, just to be part of
the community.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Margaret Lawton, who also taught at the law school, started
Buchanan County's first humane society. The couple adopted two children,
a little boy from Russia and within the last six months, an infant
daughter from China.</TE>
<TE>   They moved from Washington, where Sutin had served in the Clinton
administration as an assistant attorney general under Janet Reno. He also
had been a partner in a top Washington law firm and wrote many articles
for legal journals.</TE>
<TE>   He came to Grundy, population 1,110, fired by a sense of mission. "He
gave his heart to that school," lawyer and friend Henry Keuling-Stout
said. But he didn't bang his credentials over people's heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony was educated and smart and had every reason to be snobby," said
David Thompson, who works for the county. "But he was as common as
anybody. And people liked that."</TE>
<TE>   "Peter O," as he was known, stood out in Grundy.</TE>
<TE>   Until the law school opened, "you just didn't see black people walking
down the road," one resident said. About two dozen of the school's 250
students are black.</TE>
<TE>   But more than that, in a place where self-reliance and tight-knit
families are themes, people remember the many times the Odighizuwas
needed help.</TE>
<TE>   There were the clothing drives at the hospital where Odighizuwa's
wife, Abieyuwa, worked, so the family's four boys would have clothes. And
there were the moves from house to house because of rent problems. And
several times Odighizuwa burst into faculty meetings at the law school
and asked for more money, according to students.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy had an explosive personality," said Jack Briggs, the county
medical examiner.</TE>
<TE>   Odighizuwa had enrolled at the Appalachian School of Law in September
2000, the first year Sutin was dean; he had been a professor there before
that. No one seems to know where Odighizuwa went to college and school
President Lu Ellsworth said he was told by police not to discuss his
record.</TE>
<TE>   Odighizuwa apparently flunked out at the end of the fall semester
2000, took a semester off, bagged groceries at Food City, then came back
under academic probation.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, after learning he again had flunked, authorities said
Odighizuwa marched into Sutin's office, pulled out a .380-caliber
semiautomatic pistol and shot the dean several times; at least two
bullets were fired into Sutin's back from point-blank range. Odighizuwa
then allegedly ran into the nearby office of Thomas Blackwell, his
professor of contracts, and shot him fatally in the neck while Blackwell
was sitting behind his desk.</TE>
<TE>   He dashed downstairs, police say, shooting several classmates, killing
33-year-old Angela Dales, who was his guidance counselor before becoming
a student. Three students remained in fair condition Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Odighizuwa was charged Thursday with three counts of premeditated
murder, three counts of attempted murder and six counts of unlawful
weapon use.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, 300 mourners poured out of Grundy Baptist Church where
a memorial service was held. Many were law students, but several men
wearing work boots and sooty uniforms wiped their eyes as they looked
around for someone to talk to.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, Sutin's students came up to his widow and hugged her. Some
left flowers at the law school gates. "God bless Dean Sutin," read a card
attached to a single, plastic-wrapped rose.</TE>

<HD>Bush Gets Union Allies in Arctic Drilling Drive</HD>
<DH>Energy: President renews his push for controversial legislation,
calling it a 'jobs bill.' Five trades back policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush launched a renewed pitch Thursday for legislation
that would open part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and
gas exploration, presenting the plan as a potentially rich source of jobs
and winning the embrace of five major unions.</LD>
<LD>   Reflecting an administration effort to heighten support for its
controversial energy policy, Bush journeyed to the Washington
headquarters of the Teamsters union at the base of Capitol Hill, rather
than asking the union leaders to visit him.</LD>
<LD>   The debate over the Bush energy plan goes to the heart of arguments
about how to balance environmental protection with economic development.
But the issue now is joined by the political questions surrounding the
collapse of the giant energy company Enron. Critics say Enron officials
played a large--and inappropriate--role in shaping the White House energy
policy, unveiled in May. The White House has denied that charge.</LD>
<TE>   With his visit to the Teamsters, Bush sought to focus attention on his
energy measure, which is pending in Congress. The Teamsters have long
been a politically maverick union, courted by both Democrats and
Republicans and, unlike most unions, freely switching allegiance. The
Teamsters also have been one of the most vocal unions in backing the
proposal to drill in Alaska, touting it as a source of jobs for its
members.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in brief public remarks, tailored his message accordingly. "This
energy bill that we're working on is a jobs bill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said exploring for energy sources in the Alaskan refuge would
make the United States less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil, an
argument the administration hopes will carry more clout following the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be good for our foreign policy, good for our national
security, and more importantly, it will be good for jobs," the president
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Teamsters have claimed that the administration's
drilling plan would create 700,000 jobs as the impact of the exploration
rippled through the economy. On Thursday, neither Bush nor Teamsters
President James P. Hoffa used any specific figures for job creation.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the environmental groups
opposing the development, disputes the jobs argument. It said that one
study, by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, put the number at
46,000 and asserted that many would not last more than 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation Bush is pushing was approved by the House last year
but stalled in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
has promised he will schedule a debate on the bill by mid-February.</TE>
<TE>   A political climate that had once appeared to favor the president,
when energy prices were climbing and California was struggling through
brownouts, has shifted. Energy prices have fallen, and the industry has
come under scrutiny in the wake of Enron's difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   For the short trip down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Teamsters'
headquarters, Bush was joined by his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr.,
and his top two political advisors, Karl Rove and Karen Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Hoffa had little trouble enlisting support for the
legislation among other union leaders at the meeting. Doug McCarron,
president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, said his
union members were "hunters and fishermen and campers who feel strongly
about preserving our environment."</TE>
<TE>   Unions representing seafarers, service employees and the building
trades also were at the meeting.</TE>

<HD>Bioethics Panel's Topic 1: Perfection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD T. COOPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>It's not the way your typical presidential commission begins
deliberating on a weighty policy question--spending an hour or so on a
156-year-old short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne.</LD>
<LD>   But then, if Leon R. Kass has his way, President Bush's newly formed
Council on Bioethics won't be your typical federal advisory panel.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, such bodies are often used to cool political hot
potatoes. They listen to all sides, deliberate for a year and file a
lengthy report that can be safely forgotten.</LD>
<TE>   Some wondered if the President's Council on Bioethics, created last
summer when Bush decided to let some embryonic stem cell research go
forward, was in this tradition. The stem cell decision troubled many
conservatives, and conservatives appear to be well represented on the
18-member panel.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Kass, a University of Chicago and Harvard-trained physician,
biochemist and bioethicist, made it clear at the council's first meeting
Thursday that he believes the times are ripe to break the mold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's has been a long time since the climate and mood of the country
was this hospitable to serious moral reflection," Kass said, declaring
that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had led to "a palpable increase in
America's moral seriousness."</TE>
<TE>   Kass, the panel chairman, introduced the Hawthorne story both to
indicate his intention to give the commission a serious role and to focus
attention on what he sees as potential dangers if science is pursued
without regard to moral considerations.</TE>
<TE>   The story, called "The Birthmark," deals with a young scientist who
becomes so determined to remove a small birthmark from the cheek of his
otherwise-perfect wife that he plunges into an untested course of
treatment that kills her.</TE>
<TE>   Kass said during a break in the meeting that the story "allows us to
reflect deeply on the human aspiration to eliminate all defects, the
aspiration for perfection. . . . When you have the power to intervene in
the human body and mind not just to cure disease, which everyone wants to
do, but to alter human nature, those are the fundamental questions of
human life."</TE>
<TE>   The need to explore the moral implications of human cloning, stem cell
research and other scientific breakthroughs is especially urgent, Kass
suggested to the panel, because they are intertwined with laudable goals
of curing disease, relieving suffering and prolonging life.</TE>
<TE>   Along with such benefits, the new technologies "are also available for
uses that could slide us down the dehumanizing path toward a brave new
world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several panel members said cloning and other techniques could lead to
the future "manufacturing" of babies whose genetic makeup had been
determined by government or individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Princeton University law professor Robert P. George said the
Declaration of Independence, with its assertion of inalienable rights
endowed by a creator, "points to the limits of our moral authority over
human life."</TE>
<TE>   William F. May, a former professor of ethics at Southern Methodist
University, warned that "marketplace initiatives are much more important"
than before in driving medical and scientific research.</TE>
<TE>   And Francis Fukayama, a political economist at Johns Hopkins
University, urged the council to work toward creation of a federal
regulatory agency to deal with bioethics.</TE>
<TE>   But several members of the panel, including Daniel W. Foster, a
longtime researcher on diabetes and endocrinology at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, urged the group not to demonize
science on the basis of depictions like Hawthorne's.</TE>
<TE>   In remarks at the daily White House briefing, presidential spokesman
Ari Fleischer reflected the fine line the administration is trying to
draw on the new science: showing attentiveness to those concerned about
where it may lead, without seeming to oppose medical advances that could
help millions of patients. He said the president "thinks that as the
breakthroughs take place in science and in medicine which have the
potential to cure diseases, it is vital for the nation to have a full
understanding and a rich reflection and a discussion of the ethical
implications of some of the breakthroughs."</TE>

<HD>As Questions Get Louder, Cheney Stays Silent</HD>
<DH>Politics: Critics want details on meetings with Enron over energy
policy. He asserts executive privilege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The growing Enron debacle is turning up the political heat on Vice
President Dick Cheney, who has refused to detail his contacts with
company officials while developing a national energy policy last year.</LD>
<LD>   Amid Democratic charges that he granted Enron undue access--and
produced in secret an industry-friendly plan--Cheney's unyielding stance
has hampered the Bush administration's efforts to distance itself from
the scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The flap dominated Thursday's White House briefing, as it had on
Wednesday. Press Secretary Ari Fleischer reiterated Cheney's position:
that he is defending executive privilege in rebuffing the congressional
push, led by Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and John D. Dingell
(D-Mich.), for the information on his meetings with Enron officials.</LD>
<TE>   Cheney and his aides say neither he nor his energy task force did
anything wrong. Yet the impression lingers, even some Republicans
conceded, that the vice president has something to hide.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheney and his staff have violated the most fundamental of all
scandal rules: full and fast disclosure," said Larry J. Sabato, a
University of Virginia political scientist. "A flat refusal to disclose
information automatically makes the public and the press more suspicious,
and it guarantees that the headlines about the controversy will be
plentiful and unending."</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts predict that Cheney ultimately will have little
alternative but to provide the information.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Matalin, a senior Cheney advisor, rejected that scenario. She
said in an interview that Cheney will not abandon his conviction that he
is acting to protect executive privilege.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a principle here that we want to preserve--for not just this
administration but future administrations," Matalin said. "The powers and
prerogatives of the executive branch have been eroded, and we're going to
stop that."</TE>
<TE>   In resisting disclosure, however, Cheney and his aides are providing
Democrats and other critics the opportunity to depict the White House as
a shill for Enron, the nation's seventh-largest company until it filed
for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be a matter of principle, but they are going to get killed for
it," said Charles E. Cook, a Washington-based political analyst. "They
are going to lose a lot of blood and, in the end, they will release" the
requested information.</TE>
<TE>   Cook added: "The question is, how much political pain they are going
to sustain before releasing it."</TE>
<TE>   "The danger for Cheney in this Enron fiasco is perception," added one
top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity. "And perception in
politics needs to be nipped in the bud--immediately. Right now, they are
behind the perception eight-ball."</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans and White House allies reject that view--reflecting a
vigorous debate that sources say is raging in the West Wing on whether
Cheney should turn over the information sought by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "My advice to him would be to hang in there. Hang tough. I don't think
he's hurting himself," said Washington lobbyist Tom Korologos, who has
advised GOP presidents going back to Richard Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor that has helped thrust Cheney into the glare of the
Enron controversy is the trust and confidence he enjoys from President
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with being as visibly influential as Cheney has been is
that when things go wrong, he gets some of the blame," said Joel K.
Goldstein, a St. Louis University law professor and author of "The Modern
American Vice Presidency."</TE>
<TE>   In the eyes of their political detractors, including environmental
activists, Bush and Cheney were suspect on energy issues from their first
day in office, given their background in the oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney quickly fueled such concerns when, amid sharply rising energy
prices, he seemed to discount the importance of conservation in dealing
with the problem. Then his energy task force released a plan in May that
angered environmentalists and conservationists by proposing, among other
things, opening a small portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to energy exploration.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also immediately questioned the role of Enron executives in
the plan's formulation; Waxman and Dingell have been asking Cheney for
months to disclose his contacts with the company. With Enron's collapse
late last year, those requests have escalated.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee
charged that there are at least 17 policies in the White House energy
plan that are "virtually identical to positions Enron advocated."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials took strong issue with that assertion.
Matalin called it "transparent election-year politicking."</TE>
<TE>   Such unabated exchanges, however, point up the controversy's corrosive
effect on the White House and on Bush's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "The big loser last week was the president's education bill," said a
senior GOP strategist, noting that news coverage of the measure's signing
was overshadowed by the media's focus on the Enron story.</TE>
<TE>   "Mary Matalin can be flippant all she wants, but this isn't going to
go away," said the Republican, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Sabato agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Even at this late stage, Cheney's best route out of the controversy
is the same as the original one early on--full disclosure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is something about the White House that leads each new
administration to believe they are exempt from the usual rules of
scandal," Sabato added. "Perhaps the headiness of power and popularity
produces a kind of scandal amnesia. Cheney exhibits the symptoms."</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Add Options for Retirement Accounts</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) proposed changes in pension law
Thursday to give workers more flexibility to invest retirement savings
and prevent a repeat of losses suffered in the collapse of Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Employees who have vested in a company's retirement plan would be
allowed to diversify their employer's contributions and not be forced to
hold company stock, Miller said. And employers would have to give notice
before freezing workers' access to their retirement accounts; those
"lockdown" periods could last no more than 10 business days.</LD>
<LD>   His proposal is one of several in Congress aimed at avoiding
Enron-style meltdowns for employees' retirement savings.</LD>
<TE>   As the stock price plummeted last year, Enron employees and retirees
helplessly watched their life savings dissolve because the company barred
them from selling Enron shares from retirement accounts.</TE>

<HD>2-Year-Old Caught in the Middle of a Cape Cod Murder Mystery</HD>
<DH>Crime: Her mother dead, the girl's supposed dad-- married with his
own family--wants custody. There's also a sizable inheritance at stake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TRURO, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>The little girl with curly hair placed a cloth on her mother's
face, hoping it would make her feel better, hoping it would make her wake
up.</LD>
<LD>   But Christa Worthington, a 46-year-old fashion writer with an
international reputation, was dead: stabbed early this month by an
intruder so bent on entry that a deadbolt lock was ripped from
Worthington's door.</LD>
<LD>   And now Ava Gloria Worthington, the 2 1/2-year-old daughter whom
Christa doted on--rearranged her life for, in fact--is at the center of a
modern tale of motherhood and murder.</LD>
<TE>   A custody battle over the little girl with what in this region is a
substantial inheritance is the sad final chapter of a story of romance
and adventure--a story Christa Worthington herself might have written.
Instead she lived it: traveling the world, interviewing famous people.</TE>
<TE>   An only child from the comfortable old Yankee enclave of Hingham,
Mass., Worthington moved to Paris and wore designer tops with flea market
jeans. Pink high-heeled pumps were her signature footwear.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a blank spot in this tale of glamour and excitement.
Worthington wanted a child. After she turned 40, she moved home to New
England. An affair with a married local fisherman produced the daughter
she had dreamed of.</TE>
<TE>   Worthington's murder has local residents troubled. Until Worthington
was slain, this seaside community near the tip of Cape Cod had not seen a
killing in more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Said Judy Bartoswicz, an art gallery owner who also runs a video store
where Worthington and her daughter rented movies: "We don't really know
how to deal with this here."</TE>
<TE>   Truro's year-round population is just 1,800, though the summer
population surges to perhaps 10 times that.</TE>
<TE>   Many are artists or writers, drawn to a town so insistently un-chic
that it boasts not one single cappuccino bar or wine boutique.</TE>
<TE>   Truro, Bartoswicz said, rests on a reputation of safety and serenity.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch people locking their car doors when they come in here, and I
just snicker," Bartoswicz said. "I know right away they're from out of
town."</TE>
<TE>   For Worthington, the sleepy pace could not have been more of a
contrast from a life of glamour in Paris, London and New York.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Vassar, Worthington plunged into a career
covering art and fashion for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Women's Wear Daily,
the New York Times and other publications. She wrote several books,
including "Chic Simple," in which she described shoes as "the libido of
the wardrobe."</TE>
<TE>   She hobnobbed with celebrities--visiting Yves Saint Laurent at his
summer house, for instance, and then telling friends how the designer
painted the walls to look like Monet's waterlilies. She had a closet full
of evening gowns, but she also loved to wear outrageous clothes from
thrift stores and flea markets.</TE>
<TE>   Worthington was small, and so beautiful that her friend Alice Furleau,
a former radio journalist in Paris, described her as "a woman with the
oval face of a [John Singer] Sargent portrait."</TE>
<TE>   She had plenty of boyfriends, scattered around the globe. But for much
of her life she longed for what she didn't have: a child.</TE>
<TE>   "There is, at the moment, no father for a child of mine, no husband
for me, and what if there never is?" she wrote five years ago in the
Times of London. She went to a fertility clinic to find a sperm donor,
but her top two choices were sold out.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Worthington's mother, Gloria, an artist, was found to have
cancer. Her mother's illness gave Christa an incentive to return to
Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   She settled into a shingled house here near Mill Pond that her family
had owned for years while generations of Worthingtons worked in the local
fishnet industry. An aunt, designer Tiny Worthington, even is credited
with turning fishnets into a fashion accessory in the 1960s when she
launched a line of dresses, head wear and hosiery made from fishnet.</TE>
<TE>   Four days after Christa Worthington's mother died, Ava was born.
Interior decorator Margaret McNeil said that in Truro, Worthington picked
the perfect spot for a single mother living on freelance writing checks
and a trust fund that paid $1,700 per month.</TE>
<TE>   "Down here, you can live pretty well on that," McNeil said.</TE>
<TE>   As a mariner town where men went off to sea, Truro long has had a
strong community of women. With its vibrant corps of artists, the town
also has an international flavor: painters who each year follow the
seasons--and the light--from Italy's Tuscany region to Truro and back.</TE>
<TE>   McNeil described Truro people as introverted: "You don't get the 'Hey,
how're you doing,' yet you know that if you have to call someone, they'll
be there."</TE>
<TE>   The low-key atmosphere, McNeil said, leads residents to let their
guards down.</TE>
<TE>   "You tend to be more open to people even if they're not living the
perfect lifestyle themselves," McNeil said. "Even though everybody
gossips, we try not to be judgmental."</TE>
<TE>   With one small general store, a tiny post office and a public library
that passes as the center of the universe, Truro's year-round residents
recognize each other by sight.</TE>
<TE>   "In a town like Truro, you know everybody," real estate agent Charles
M. Leigh said.</TE>
<TE>   Worthington's brief relationship with 51-year-old Tony Jackett was an
open secret. Jackett, who as Truro's shellfish constable enforced fishing
regulations, waited 18 months before telling his wife and six children
about the baby. Soon, Christa and Ava were making regular visits to the
Jacketts at their home.</TE>
<TE>   During this time, Worthington dated others, including Tim Arnold, who
found her body.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold, 45, a children's book author, told police he went to her house
Jan. 6 to return a flashlight. He found the door ajar, and saw bloody
footprints that Ava had tracked around the house. Wearing a nightgown,
Worthington was on the kitchen floor, dead.</TE>
<TE>   Police think she may have been dead as long as 36 hours before Arnold
found her body. Authorities immediately placed Ava in the home of family
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Truro Police Chief John Thomas said earlier this week that interviews
were proceeding, but authorities have made no arrests in Worthington's
killing.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas confirmed that more than 20 people have been interviewed in
connection with the death. Arnold and Jackett have denied any connection
to the slaying and are cooperating with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Three months before she was killed, Worthington asked friends Cliff
and Amyra Chase to be Ava's guardians in the event of her death.
Worthington and Amyra Chase were high school buddies, and Worthington
said she admired the way Chase was raising her own four children,
according to a friend, Jude Pearson, who is acting as family spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Since Jan. 8, Ava has been in the Chases' care. The child is the sole
beneficiary of Worthington's $700,000 estate.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanied by his wife of more than 30 years, Jackett went to a Cape
Cod court days after Worthington's death to seek custody of Ava.</TE>
<TE>   Jackett did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment, but he
told the Boston Globe that when Worthington found out she was pregnant
"she was ecstatic, and I was speechless."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Jackett filed a petition for custody of Ava. At a hearing
at which he said he had covered the child on his medical insurance, a
judge ordered Jackett to take a DNA test to prove fatherhood. The results
will be disclosed at a Jan. 24 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   On a cold, gray Cape Cod day, Truro residents said that, of course,
they were concerned about what will happen to Ava. But the notion that a
murderer might be at large in their small town also made people here
uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "I know of three movies that have been filmed on Cape Cod in the last
five years," interior decorator Theresa Rogers said. "All of them were
murder mysteries. Now we kind of feel like we're living one of those
movies ourselves."</TE>

<HD>Court Backs Michigan Drug Plan for Poor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANSING, Mich.
</DL>
<LD>A Michigan appeals court cleared the way Thursday for a sweeping
new plan to hold down state spending on prescription drugs for the poor.</LD>
<LD>   The Michigan Court of Appeals lifted a lower court judge's order
blocking the plan. It can now take effect Feb. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The state plan--one of the biggest attempts in the nation to cut drug
costs--lets doctors prescribe only certain discounted medications to the
1.6 million low-income patients who rely on state aid in Michigan,
including Medicaid and programs for infants and the elderly. Doctors must
get authorization for medications not on the list.</LD>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical companies sued over the plan, saying it would limit
patients' access to certain drugs. Among the drugs not on the list are
Ritalin, the antidepressant Prozac and the antibiotic Cipro.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 7, state Circuit Judge Lawrence Glazer blocked the plan,
saying the state overstepped its authority because it did not get
approval from the Legislature. But the appeals court said it is not
convinced that a delay is needed to protect patients.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely pleased to move forward with our efforts to offer
high-quality health care to low-income Michigan citizens while prudently
managing costs," said James Haveman, director of the state Department of
Community Health.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Lott, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, said: "We are disappointed that patients could
be subjected to procedures that could be harmful to them, but we're
confident we'll make that case in court."</TE>
<TE>   The state has said that it spends about $1 billion a year on drugs for
Medicaid and other health care programs, and that the new plan would save
at least $42 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical companies were angered by the list of preferred drugs,
which was developed by a team of 11 doctors and pharmacists chosen by
Gov. John Engler.</TE>
<TE>   The companies were not consulted about the list and were then told
they would have to provide discounts or risk having their drugs removed
from it.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Beats Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Earnings: But firm sees decline in PC sales and trims
expectations for the first half of the year.</DH>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. blew past estimates of its sales and profit for the
last three months of 2001,  but the software giant's stock price
dipped late Thursday after it reduced expectations for the next six
months.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest maker of desktop computer operating systems
said it expects PC sales to fall slightly in the first six months of
this year, reversing a forecast in October of a 2% increase.</LD>
<LD>   "Microsoft [and other major tech companies reporting earnings] are
throwing a little cold water on the optimism investors had that
things are getting better," said Rick Sherlund, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs. "In terms of the pace of recovery, Microsoft turned
the dial back a little bit."</LD>
<TE>   Combined with economic deterioration in the key market of Japan
and slowed corporate spending in the U.S., the PC slump should give
Microsoft a lower operating profit in the current quarter than
analysts have forecast the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are expecting a quite strong economic recovery. I think
it's from our perspective too early to call that," Microsoft Chief
Financial Officer John Connors said.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares rose $1.99 to $69.86 in regular trading Thursday
on Nasdaq, then fell to $67.90 in after-hours trading after the
earnings report.</TE>
<TE>   The Redmond, Wash.-based company scaled back its near-term profit
assumptions, a shift that represents the success of one of its
financial approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that big businesses have less need than before to switch
to newer Windows operating systems and such application suites as
Microsoft Office, the company has been prodding corporate customers
to sign longer-term, more-expensive contracts that include automatic
upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   Connors told investors that the plan was ahead of schedule. Under
accounting rules, that means a lot of the revenue that Microsoft used
to collect immediately has now been deferred to once-a-year bills.
The result: short-term earnings will decline, but the longer-term
profit will rise.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also said it topped internal expectations for the launch
of the Xbox game console, selling 1.5 million systems in the quarter,
and did better than it had thought with the new Windows XP operating
system, licensing 17 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Those sales helped Microsoft earn $2.8 billion in its third
quarter of 2001, or 49 cents a share, before a $660-million pretax
charge for the possible settlement of class-action lawsuits. That
per-share profit and revenue of $7.7 billion easily topped
expectations of 43 cents and about $7.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "They just posted a very impressive quarter," said analyst Jim
Moore of Deutsche Bank. "Everything is going in their favor except
for PC growth."</TE>
<TE>   Citing economic conditions in Japan and Europe and standard
promotions of new products, Microsoft warned that the bulge in
Windows XP and Xbox sales probably will not continue.</TE>
<TE>   And Microsoft is losing more profitable server-software revenue
while gaining low- or no-margin Xbox revenue, Sherlund said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore and other analysts suggested that the company might be
steering expectations too low.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest variable for the business is PC growth," Moore said.
"Investors are going to have to sort through how much of this is
being conservative."</TE>
