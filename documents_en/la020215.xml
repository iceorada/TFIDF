<LD>What would a corporate spin-meister do given the task of trying to
repackage Ken Lay and the Enron gang? "Nothing can be done," says
Eric Dezenhall, a master of spin who once worked for Ronald Reagan.
Mobsters, he continues, would be easier to represent.</LD>
<LD>   Dezenhall, who was in town to give 800 attorneys some pointers on
dealing with Enron-like P.R. problems, has just found an easy
transition from current events to his favorite subject: guys like
Tony Soprano.</LD>
<LD>   Mobsters are the focus of his recently published "Money Wanders"
(St. Martin's Press), a novel in which Mario Vanni, a mob boss, hires
a spin doctor to improve his image. "It's a comical autopsy of how
smear and disinformation campaigns work." The gist of the campaign:
The mob you know is better than an unknown quantity. "They might even
be good for you."</LD>
<TE>   Dezenhall knows them well. He grew up near Atlantic City, N.J., in
a neighborhood where people worked in, um, "waste management," or as
Dezenhall puts it, "as cigarette salesmen." It was a childhood that
today makes him identify strongly with teen character Meadow Soprano.
"On the one hand, they wanted you to succeed," Dezenhall says. "But
if you got too big for your britches, they would knock you down."</TE>
<TE>   He eventually left New Jersey for Washington, D.C., to work in
Reagan's White House communications office. Later, he uncovered
mobster Meyer Lansky's diaries, excerpted in the New Republic. He got
the diaries through family connections, he says.</TE>
<TE>   His family seems to have had many connections.</TE>
<TE>   "You remember in the beginning, when one of Soprano's [associates]
gets killed?" Dezenhall says, unable to bring himself to mention the
character's name, which contains a vulgarity. That character, he
says, was based on a friend of his family's, and as a child,
Dezenhall was introduced to him. "I asked my uncle, 'Don't people
make fun of his name?' And my uncle, cigar hanging from his mouth,
simply said, 'No.'"</TE>
<TE>   Stories like that surfaced as Dezenhall researched his book,
seeking out wise guys and old family friends. Since "Money Wanders"
was published, "I've gotten calls from mob people, they want to know
if it's based on them."</TE>
<TE>   But he counsels them against seeking the spotlight. If Tony
Soprano called him for image advice, the message would be Meyer
Lansky's simple admonition:</TE>
<TE>   "Stay out of the press."</TE>
<TE>   Vegas Calls the Oscars, Unofficially</TE>
<TE>   It's illegal to bet on the Oscars in Las Vegas, but that hasn't
stopped John Avello from setting odds, just for fun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get a gauge on them, but I just kind of go by what I
read and what the hype is out there," said Avello, the director of
race and sports book operations for the Bally's and Paris hotels in
Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't always a foolproof method, however. In December,
director Michael Mann's "Ali" was Avello's odds-on favorite for best
picture. Then he saw the movie. Post-viewing, the film didn't even
make his top five. Everyone, it seems, is a critic.</TE>
<TE>   After the nominations were announced on Tuesday, Avello posted
this year's odds. The safest bets on his list are "A Beautiful Mind"
for best picture (2-1), best director (Ron Howard, 2-1), best actor
(Russell Crowe, 1-1) and best actress in a supporting role (Jennifer
Connelly, 2-1). Jim Broadbent in "Iris" is a sure thing for best
actor in a supporting role (1-1). Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge" has
a 2-1 shot at best actress.</TE>
<TE>   The longshots are "Gosford Park" for best picture (12-1), David
Lynch for best director of "Mulholland Drive" (10-1), Will Smith in
"Ali" for best actor (10-1), Renee Zellweger in "Bridget Jones's
Diary" for best actress (10-1) and Ethan Hawke in "Training Day" for
best actor in a supporting role (15-1).</TE>
<TE>   Wagering on the Oscars is prohibited by the Las Vegas gaming
control board because the outcome is known in advance (by the famous
pair of PricewaterhouseCooper accountants), Avello said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many gamblers can't resist trying to bet on the awards
ceremony. "Starting Friday night [before the Oscars], I'll probably
get 50 to 100 calls from people asking if they can wager on this,"
Avello said. "A lot of people don't like to read that fine print."</TE>
<TE>   So how reliable are Avello's odds? "I was three out of six last
year," he said. "I'm around a 70% to 80% range. But there's always a
surprise in there."</TE>
<TE>   Jury Is Out in</TE>
<TE>   James Brown Case</TE>
<TE>   Jurors began deliberating in the James Brown sexual harassment
lawsuit this week. The mostly female jury met for several hours
Tuesday and Wednesday and was ordered to return to court Tuesday
after the Presidents Day holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Ross Agbalaya, who managed Brown's West Coast operations, is
suing Brown for $2 million. She has testified that from July 1999 to
August 2000, Brown made unwanted sexual advances while she worked for
New James Brown Enterprises. Inc. Agbalaya claims she was fired for
refusing Brown's overtures.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has said he fired Agbalaya because his company was having
financial troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Brown spent several days on the stand, testifying in
his own defense. His wardrobe seemed to grow more glamorous from one
day to the next. The first day of testimony he wore a shiny electric
blue suit, black cowboy boots with silver tips and his trademark
coiffure. He followed that ensemble the next day with a silver lame
suit.</TE>

<HD>Sorting Out Utah Alcohol Laws Could Leave You Tipsy</HD>
<DH>A confusing array of rules greets the would-be imbiber,
requiring bartenders to be savvy and patrons (including visitors to
the Olympics) patient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A woman walks into a bar and tries to order a drink. The bartender
points to a blond woman on a stool across the room. Ask her, he says.</LD>
<LD>   The thirsty out-of-stater sidles up, clears her throat:</LD>
<LD>   "Hi," she says. "Will you sponsor me?"</LD>
<TE>   "Sure," the woman replies.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like a joke, but this is reality in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   As many of the visitors to the Olympics have probably discovered
by now, getting an alcoholic drink in Utah can be an adventure. The
laws that govern the sale and consumption of alcohol are so arcane
and applied with such apparent randomness that just finding a drink
may addle their brains more than the altitude.</TE>
<TE>   "There is just bizarre stuff," said Jake Six, who works at Harry
O's, a popular nightclub in Park City. "I mean it is a different
class of bizarreness than you see anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for armchair urban anthropologists, a few days spent
observing the local customs of alcohol culture in Utah yield a mother
lode of harmless peculiarities.</TE>
<TE>   Because their Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints frowns
on alcohol, most Mormons don't drink. Seventy percent of the state's
2.2-million population is Mormon, the state's entire congressional
delegation is Mormon, and the governor and 90% of the state
Legislature are Mormon. Liquor laws are designed to regulate, tax and
slow alcohol consumption.</TE>
<TE>   Utah's reputation can be a deterrent for young urbanites who want
to move there.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Fray, 25, moved to Salt Lake City from Oregon five years ago
for the skiing. Friends warned him the nightlife would be dismal. "I
always heard Utah was a drag," Fray said. "I heard, 'Never go to
Utah. There is nothing to do. You can't drink. There is nothing to do
but ski.' "</TE>
<TE>   It's true, he said. Clubs close early, and the drinks are thin.
"So you just readjust your schedule," Fray said. "You go out at 8 or
9, instead of 11 or midnight. It turns out it's pretty OK," he said.
"It's not like L.A., or Portland, where the club scene is a club
scene. But it's better than they say."</TE>
<TE>   Residents who crave a strong brew now and then say the stringent
drinking laws are a small price to pay to live in a corner of the
world with perfect snow, mountains that carve the horizon into a
breathtaking backdrop and enough wilderness to engage in just about
any outdoor sport. "Such is life," said Six. "That's what it takes to
live in a beautiful place like this."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the days until Feb. 24, when the Olympic Winter
Games end, will be a test of sorts for bartenders across the Wasatch
Range. Liquor laws are hard enough for Utahans to follow. Explaining
their intricacies to fellow Americans, let alone a multitude of
foreigners, could create a Babel-like situation at pub entrances
while the Olympics are in town.</TE>
<TE>   At least five nations--Austria, Germany, Slovakia, Switzerland and
Italy--planned to import their own beer, wine and liquor, invoking
"diplomatic pouch" privileges. The special status will, among other
things, allow Olympic committees to evade Utah's hefty sin taxes.</TE>
<TE>   To help ease confusion about local drinking customs, Salt Lake
City Mayor Rocky Anderson's office has produced a press kit for the
approximately 12,000 journalists in Utah to cover the Olympics, which
includes an explanation about how to get a drink in town.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the most cost-effective way to get the word out," said
Joshua Ewing, the mayor's director of communications. "It's to combat
the misconception that people have about Utah--that you can't get a
drink here. There are more places to get a drink here than in the
last two Winter Olympics combined."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, invoking laws that
control the way alcohol is sold in 18 other states, maintains on its
Web site that "Utah's system of controlling the sale of alcoholic
beverages is not as unique as most people believe." But the Utah
system bears some study.</TE>
<TE>   Among its quirks:</TE>
<TE>   The alcohol content of most beer in Utah cannot exceed 3.2%. (By
contrast, the alcohol content of beer in California is unregulated,
although beer that exceeds 5.7% alcohol must be so labeled.) To
purchase stronger beer, Utahans have to shop at one of 37 state-run
liquor stores, or one of 97 "package agencies," which offer a
narrower selection of liquor, wine and beer.</TE>
<TE>   Purveyors of alcoholic beverages are governed by one of three
classes of liquor license. A tavern license means only 3.2% beer may
be sold. No wine, nor spirits. A restaurant license means 3.2% beer,
wine and liquor may be sold, but cannot be displayed. (Anyone
ordering a drink in a restaurant must have an "intent to eat.") A
private club license means all three may be sold and displayed.</TE>
<TE>   This means most establishments that an out-of-towner would
normally consider "bars" are actually "private clubs."</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, what appear to be typical bars are not hard to
find. Indeed, the city's Web site claims that Salt Lake has more
micro-breweries per person than any other U.S. city. But what happens
once a thirsty soul tries to enter a bar or club is what's out of the
ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors have two ways in: they can either become a member of an
establishment, which costs money, or find a sponsor, which is free.
Typically, a two-week membership costs about $5; a yearlong
membership hovers in the $20 range. Most clubs allow any patron
already in the club to act as a sponsor. Every "member" may then
sponsor five guests at a time. Sponsorships solicited the wrong way
can spell trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Hull, who tends bar at Cisero's Nightclub in Park City, said
he was once taken to court, threatened with a $1,500 fine and
suspension of his bar license, for mishandling the membership
procedure when serving an undercover agent (both the state Bureau of
Investigation and the local police department use undercover
investigators). His error? He asked a member if he wanted to sponsor
someone, rather than waiting for the non-member to initiate the
conversation himself. His boss intervened, took responsibility for
not instructing him correctly on the law, and he was let off with a
warning.</TE>
<TE>   "Just finding someone to sponsor you is a pain," said Alyssum
Hutson, 21, an acting major from Houston studying at the University
of Utah. "It [membership] gets expensive for college kids."</TE>
<TE>   But Hutson and Summer Shirey, 22, also an acting major, said they
have learned how to get what they want.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never bought a membership," boasts Shirey. "There are always
ways to get around it. It's people who don't know the system who buy
the memberships."</TE>
<TE>   Probably the best advice to visitors navigating the night scene in
Utah is what you'd get in any good travel guide explaining eccentric
local customs: Follow the rules (don't bother trying to understand
them) and revel in the down-the-rabbit-hole feel of the place where
things are not quite what they seem.</TE>
<TE>   In the blocks surrounding Olympic Square downtown, many bars can
be found in weird nooks and unexpected places. Temporary sawhorse
signs on city sidewalks can be the giveaway for those in search of
nightlife. The Dead Goat Saloon is hidden down an icy, dark alley.
The Bull and Bear requires patrons to walk through a nondescript,
well-lit elevator lobby of a downtown office building, down the
stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Park City, about 25 miles outside Salt Lake City, which draws
cosmopolitan crowds for its skiing and Sundance Film Festival, is a
different story. Bars are more out in the open; easy to spot. "This
is it, Sin City of Utah," said Six, the doorman at Harry O's in Park
City. "You can't even get a bus here from Salt Lake....We are the
heathens."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to some of the more obscured Salt Lake City bars,
Harry O's occupies a huge warehouse-size space upstairs in a historic
WPA building, across from the town post office. Harry O's has the
biggest dance floor in the state, a huge-screen TV, a stage,
balconies, deejays and dancing, and will offer some big-name acts
during the Olympics, including Sheryl Crow. The nightclub claims to
sell more booze than any other establishment in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever you are in Utah, though, the rules remain.</TE>
<TE>   But because they vary so much from place to place, figuring out
how the membership rules are applied is as tricky as negotiating the
moguls on the black diamond slopes of Widowmaker at Park City Ski
Resort.</TE>
<TE>   At Murphy's Bar and Grill downtown in Salt Lake City, guests were
asked to sign a large leather-bound book laid open on a table by the
entrance. No fee was charged. No membership was handed out. When
asked who was the sponsor, the bouncer said: "The owner."</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner at O'Shucks Bar and Grill, a sign on the window
declared: "I.D. and membership required." First, the bouncer told an
out-of-towner there was a $5 membership fee, then softened. "I'll
tell you what," he said. "I'll charge you $3 for the cover  and waive
the membership charge."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby at the Bull and Bear, when two newcomers waded into the
semidarkness, as if on cue patrons at surrounding tables raised their
hands and yelled out, "I'll sponsor them!"</TE>
<TE>   In the days before the Games, Salt Lake City and Park City were
still relatively quiet. But explaining the rules of alcohol
consumption to the slow trickle of out-of-town patrons was already
proving to be a challenge for some bartenders and bouncers.  At the
Dead Goat, bouncer Danno Elder was getting peeved as the first groups
of foreigners straggled through the door, and he had to explain the
membership system to each of them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard," he said. "It's bad enough with the ones who speak
English. But with the ones who don't speak English, they are just
looking at me like, 'What is this guy talking about?'"</TE>
<TE>   Then, he says, he sees their faces change, to a look of "'This guy
is milking me....,'" he said. "I can just see it on their faces."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the bartenders use the rules to their advantage. "If
they give me any trouble, I won't let them in. I'll just say, 'You
are not even a member.' I've got a whole arsenal of rules I can use."</TE>
<TE>   As hard as the system is for visitors to figure out, it's also
difficult for bartenders: All liquor must be measured with a gun that
dispenses 1-ounce servings; there is no free pouring of alcohol.
Bartenders can hold only one drink at a time. Doubles are against the
law. But a cunning patron can order a shot on the side to make the
drink stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Some drinks, by the nature of their ingredients, turn into a Utah
bartender's dilemma. "Long Island ice teas are hard," said Six, of
Harry O's. "Some places do it, some places don't. It requires five
liquors, so it's a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   At Cisero's, though, even the toughest drinks were no problem.
Without batting an eye, the bartender brought a Long Island ice tea,
which typically includes equal amounts of vodka, gin, rum, tequila
and triple sec (plus a little sweet and sour and a splash of cola.)
He said he simply added one shot of alcohol as a measured ounce. The
other four were mixed as three-quarters of an ounce, an amount that
allowed them to qualify as "flavorings."</TE>
<TE>   A Utah Martini can cause a double take. When it arrives, a patron
might wonder if her eyes are playing tricks on her because the glass
is a perfectly proportioned miniature of an L.A.-size martini glass.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has these," explained Hull. "If they don't, they are
stupid, because if you serve them in a normal-sized glass it makes
your martini look like a shot."</TE>
<TE>   Hull added two large olives to raise the vodka line.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the private club memberships, the thin beer, the 1-ounce
drinks, still more surprises await. At the bar of the University Park
Marriott here, a patron can exit through a rear door to get to the
restroom five feet away. But when the patron tries to return, a sign
on the door advises that he or she must re-enter the bar through the
frontdoor, which involves a walk up the wheelchair ramp, and around
the outside of the bar--a distance of about 30 feet--"in accordance
with Utah liquor laws."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't ask," said the bartender.</TE>
<TE>   No one can accuse Utahans in the alcohol business of not having a
sense of humor about these laws. Greg Schirf, a Milwaukee native,
decided Utah needed a brewery. His Wasatch Brew Pub boasts: "The
Other Local Religion. Baptize your Taste Buds." The microbrewery
offers Polygamy Porter ("Why have just one?") and encourages patrons,
"Take One Home to the Wives."</TE>
<TE>   Squatter's, another Utah microbrewery, advertises St. Provo
Pilsner: "If you just said, 'Oh my heck' it's probably not for you."</TE>
<TE>   But for those craving a light end-of-the-day buzz, the altitude
quickly fills in where the diluted beer and miniature drinks leave
off. Salt Lake City sits at a heady 4,260 feet, Park City at even
loftier 7,080.</TE>
<TE>   "For some people drinking is a pride thing," said Hull. "But
anyone coming up from sea level is going to get hit pretty hard."</TE>

<LD>AMERICA'S FIRST DYNASTY</LD>
<LD>   The Adamses, 1735-1918</LD>
<LD>   by Richard Brookhiser</LD>
<TE>   The Free Press</TE>
<TE>   $25, 256 pages</TE>
<TE>   At a time when a certain sentimentalism is creeping into
contemporary reconsiderations of the Founding Fathers, Richard
Brookhiser's new book about the Adams family comes as a bracing
tonic.</TE>
<TE>   Brookhiser, a senior editor at William F. Buckley's National
Review and a columnist for the New York Observer, admires the
Adamses. He seems to share their skeptical conservatism. "The Adamses
were skeptical about their country," he writes, "because they were
skeptical about man."</TE>
<TE>   But in "America's First Dynasty," a brisk brief survey of the
lives of President John Adams, his son John Quincy Adams (also a U.S.
president), his son, the diplomat Charles Francis Adams and his son,
historian Henry Adams, Brookhiser planes no rough edges and applies
no varnish.</TE>
<TE>   His Adamses are the way historians and casual readers of their
diaries, letters and writing have always seen them. They were vain,
prickly, ambitious, condescending toward those who were not Adamses,
always examining themselves to see if they were truly great, and if
not, why not? None of their Calvinist Puritan ancestors could have
examined their consciences for moral flaws more assiduously than the
Adamses fretted about their place in the history of their beloved
Republic.</TE>
<TE>   For they did, after all, do great things for American independence
and its ungainly child, the United States of America. John Adams
often drove his colleagues half crazy, but he was a strong and steady
force in the push for independence. John Quincy Adams was, like his
father, a failure as president, but later as a congressman he spoke
for the conscience of America in the debates over slavery before the
Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Francis Adams, sent by Lincoln as minister to Great
Britain, worked successfully, with the help of Grant's eventually
victorious Union armies, to keep Britain from recognizing the
Confederacy. And Henry Adams, the most recent and most accessible of
the great chain of Adamses, casts a mordant and ironic eye over
American history, past and present.</TE>
<TE>   The genial David McCullough, in his most readable and current
bestseller "John Adams," gets as much of the sympathetic side of the
Founder as a writer can.</TE>
<TE>   John Adams becomes in McCullough's hands almost an avuncular type;
McCullough smoothes out his personality. McCullough makes little of
the anti-Constitutional Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, passed by
Congress and signed by Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Brookhiser will have none of that. A more elegant writer than
McCullough, his judgments are incisive. Of John Adams' writing style,
Brookhiser notes that historians and biographers take most of their
quotations from John Adams' letters or diaries, and few from his
published works of political theory. "That is because," Brookhiser
writes, "his published works are hardly ever quotable; in large
patches, they are barely readable."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Francis Adams, whose stern self-control differentiated him
from his largely drunken brothers and uncles, worked fitfully and
ineffectively in politics. "John and John Quincy," Brookhiser writes,
"had both professed to be above the scrum of partisanship; to desire
office only when it came to them; to disdain the fever of ambition.
They were sincere enough in these professions to hobble themselves in
their practice of politics; not nearly sincere enough to stay home."</TE>
<TE>   The Adamses came to regard the White House as practically their
personal property and its current inhabitants, whoever they were,
barely worthy of living there. Henry Adams patronized Grant, as his
father had Abraham Lincoln. In the end the Adamses' sense of
superiority and aloofness from American life degenerated, in Henry
Adams, into a vile anti-Semitism. He equated Jews with everything
inferior to the Adamses, and his book "The Education of Henry Adams"
is pessimistic and snobbish. But Brookhiser admires more his
"Mont-St. Michel and Chartres." Of Henry Adams' infatuation with the
12th century veneration of the Virgin Mary, Brookhiser remarks that
in contemporary America she has come to dwell among us as the Virgin
of Guadalupe.</TE>
<TE>   Brookhiser's brief survey of the Adams men (their wives enter his
story only tangentially) is deft and to the point. He has done well
by this first of the first families, and well to boot by his readers.</TE>

<HD>Shape of Things to Come</HD>
<DH>Two newcomers to Fashion Week cause a buzz with bracing
contrasts and fierce femininity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NEW YORK COLLECTIONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a week of mostly lackluster fashion shows (and almost no
partying), two young designers presented fall collections that
generated a level of excitement that's been absent from the fashion
world lately.</LD>
<LD>   The buzz about Zac Posen and Balenciaga's Nicolas Ghesquiere, both
of whom showed their exquisite collections here for the first time,
has been nonstop this week.</LD>
<LD>   Most designers who have shown so far have played it safe, drawing
on tried-and-true themes of Americana-inspired and Olympic ski-lodge
looks. Perhaps that is why Ghesquiere, Posen and a handful of other
Fashion Week newcomers have found such an enthusiastic audience.</LD>
<TE>   None wowed the smaller-than-usual fashion crowd as much as
Paris-based Ghesquiere, who is having his New York moment with a
daring combination of contrasting shapes that could become a new
silhouette. "I wanted to bring something very different, something
that was a contrast from my past work, a contrast between sharp and
loose," said Ghesquiere, whose voluminous silhouette for this spring
differs from his signature narrow looks. Now, for fall, he has
combined the two.</TE>
<TE>   The most original creations of his 30 pieces combined tight and
loose shapes in a single garment--dresses and tops that were snug on
one half of the body and loose on the other. Or a fitted sleeve on
the left and a full one on the right.</TE>
<TE>   He teamed narrow pants with tops or mini-dresses loaded with
eccentric embellishments: patchworked cotton yarns, fringe strips and
odd-shaped panels. His finely tailored coats hugged the body;
voluminous gray cashmere sweaters were sleeveless and worn with short
skirts or lean trousers. And finally came several stunning beige and
off-white boucle tops, coats and vests that looked as if they had
been crafted from shaggy rugs.</TE>
<TE>   Posen, a 21-year-old native New Yorker, wowed his audience with
vampy 1940s-inspired garments such as bias-cut dresses, with fishtail
or handkerchief hems and plunging necklines in a collection he called
"Artemis," after the Greek deity who, according to the designer, "was
a veritable encyclopedia of feminine possibility."</TE>
<TE>   Like Ghesquiere, Posen toyed with contrasts in culottes that
featured one pleated and one unpleated leg. Posen, who studied at
London's Central St. Martin's design school, says he relies on
"historical couture techniques," whether in his "she-man
jumpsuit"--fierce and slender--or in a one-piece pleated corset and
billowing skirt. A stunner was a red-hooded dress that resembled a
raincoat.</TE>
<TE>   For a finale, he sent out a column of a dress intricately
constructed from strips of brown leather fastened together by more
than 1,000 hand-sewn hooks and eyes. Unhooked from the knees down,
the leather looked like strips of ribbon.</TE>
<TE>   A tuxedo-clad Posen received a standing ovation from a crowd that
often shouted out "Way to go, Zac!" as if he were competing for
Fashion Week's Gold Medal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for a youth movement to come out of New York again," he
said after the show. "We've been having a fine arts movement for a
while in this country, but there hasn't been a strong fashion
movement, creatively, in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   The designer debutantes stand out because most designers, who
usually show here, are taking a conservative approach. "There's never
been a more important time for new talent to emerge," said Fern
Mallis, executive director of 7th on Sixth, producer of Fashion Week.
"In the past we've always had to push people to go see the new
designers. This season has been different because there has been good
buzz about the new designers." But, she adds, "a good idea is a good
idea, but not if it doesn't sell."</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Valley, another first-timer to Fashion Week, sent his guests
into a frenzy with a sultry zippered leather collection inspired by
the late Mexican actress Maria Felix. His parrot-appliqued black
leather coats with zippered sleeves and bright yellow silk lining, as
well as trousers decorated in creative ways with multiple zippers,
were standouts for the architecture grad student who started with a
couture line in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Noteworthy but perhaps less innovative was Los Angeles-based Rick
Owens, known for his rock star creations. His models were somber,
almost funereal looking, wearing caps covering their heads and necks.
He paired flowing, free-form skirts, many with raw hems that dragged
the floor, with corduroy and ultra-thin leather jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Most designers who usually show here are taking a conservative
approach, realizing that closets across America are full and that
money is tight.</TE>
<TE>   Departing from the pack was Ralph Lauren, who broke from his
trademark New England casual looks and colors and presented an
all-black, impeccably tailored collection Thursday morning. The
looks, which were more formal and fitted than his usual country
styles, included cashmere versions of tuxedo-styled jackets and pants
as well as fitted velvet jackets and leather vests. The black, which
some thought was a mournful reference to the Sept. 11 tragedy, became
secondary to the fine cut and execution of the line.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar de la Renta also presented a different theme: a beautiful
Russian-inspired collection of fox-trimmed coats with oversized fur
hats, gowns embellished with coins or plush patchwork, gypsy blouses
and smocked chiffon gowns.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, designer after designer mixed it all up, as if to say
that it's perfectly fine to take last season's denim overalls and
wear them with fall's can't-live-without-it mink blazer. Trends
include ruching on everything from blouses to trousers, smocked tops
and dresses, patchwork detailing on many garments, ruffles on shirts,
cuffs on flat-front and wide-legged trousers. Jumpsuits, gaucho pants
and culottes dominate the runway.</TE>
<TE>   The range of looks? Kaleidoscope-patterned wrap dresses from Diane
Von Furstenberg, high-collared sweaters and floor-length long-rider
western coats from Catherine Malandrino, lame coats and three-piece
pinstriped suits from Carolina Herrera and luxury ski looks in suede
from Michael Kors. Add to the mix vintage looks from Donna Karan's
DKNY collection of worn-out leather jackets and Marc Jacob's
'70s-inspired corduroy bell bottoms, sweeping scarves, knit vests and
hats.</TE>
<TE>   The look for fall may depend on how a woman puts the clothes
together, a la the odd combinations worn with much success on "Sex
and the City." But then Sarah Jessica Parker, who plays the
clothes-obsessed Carrie Bradshaw, might have a change of heart after
viewing Ghesquiere's collection from her perch in the front row.</TE>

<LD>What Is a Cetacean?</LD>
<LD>   A cetacean is a whale, dolphin or porpoise. These marine mammals
share many characteristics that put them in the scientific order
"cetacea." They all have streamlined bodies and paddle-like flippers
to help them live in the water.</LD>
<LD>   We are lucky to live near the Pacific Ocean because many cetaceans
can be seen in our waters. The most-watched cetacean is the Pacific
gray whale, which migrates every year from the seas near Alaska all
the way to the lagoons of Baja California. It is one of the longest
migrations of any mammal on Earth--10,000 to 14,000 miles round trip.
Other cetaceans we might see are bottlenose dolphins, which often
swim close to shore, and common dolphins, which love to "bow ride" in
the waves at the front of a boat. In recent years, killer whales have
been spotted off the coast.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes it is easy to see cetaceans. You can be sitting on the
beach and see a pod of dolphins riding the waves. The gray whale can
be seen from shore too. The two most common identifying features are
either its flukes rising out of the water as it dives, or the spout
of air it blows as it surfaces to breathe. It is always special to
see cetaceans living freely in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   It is very important to keep our ocean healthy because it is the
cetaceans' home. Everyone can help by recycling and reusing materials
and keeping trash out of storm drains, which flow to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The American Cetacean Society with the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium
conducts field trips and gives lectures during the gray whale
migration. For more information, contact Alex Long at (310) 548-8397
or visit www.acsonline.org.</TE>

<DH>'Survivor: Africa' winner goes native in Perry Ellis and
Jane Seymour tries on a new role for New York's Fashion Week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--For 39 days, Ethan Zohn, the $1-million winner of CBS'
"Survivor: Africa," unabashedly paraded on the tube in basic shorts
and not much else. But when it came time for Zohn, 28, to change into
Perry Ellis wear for his first modeling gig on a runway, the shy guy
hid behind a rack of clothes.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pretty daunting being back here," Zohn said after the show
about the experience. "This is the last place on Earth I'd ever
thought I'd be--but the clothes are very cool."</LD>
<LD>   Not much of a clotheshorse, Zohn, a professional soccer player,
prefers sportswear off the field too. "During 'Survivor,' all I was
allowed to pack was one T-shirt, one pair of shorts, one pair of
pants, one sweatshirt, one hat and two pairs of socks."</LD>
<TE>   Zohn still likes to keep his look simple. "I just wear what's
comfortable--not much. Besides, what I really liked I never was able
to afford."</TE>
<TE>   But, hey, you've got a million bucks now, buddy.</TE>
<TE>   "That money is in the bank," he said and then quickly added, "but
there are some pretty nice suits back here I'd like to take a look
at."</TE>
<TE>   Taking Time to Stop</TE>
<TE>   and Wear the Flowers</TE>
<TE>   She's portrayed Maria Callas, Wallis Simpson, Marie Antoinette and
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman--not exactly your shy types. But Jane
Seymour was almost speechless at the debut of her first apparel line
at an intimate gathering at the Sherry Netherland Hotel on Fifth
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more nervous today than for any movie," said Seymour, who
personally designed 45 outfits for the Crossing Pointe catalog and
Web site (www.crossingpointe.com) operations of direct marketer Blair
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Priced from $22 to $100, the spring-summer collection of chiffon
floral dresses, beaded denim separates and cocktail numbers, in sizes
from petite to 22, are inspired by one of Seymour's other
passions--painting. Her floral artwork has been copied into fabric
patterns or refigured into embroidery and beaded details.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after her event, the actress, who favors Escada,
Valentino and Chanel, was spotted at Gen Art's show, wearing one of
her own designs: A $70 violet bouquet print silk chiffon dress and
shoulder wrap. Just call her Dr. Quinn, Designing Woman.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Speak</TE>
<TE>   Means No Speak</TE>
<TE>   Just before the start of Zac Posen's show, Secret Service agents
escorted one of the First Twins, Barbara, to a front row seat. Posen,
a family friend, invited Barbara to the show but she politely refused
to talk to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Question: "Aren't you Barbara Bush?"</TE>
<TE>   Answer: "Yes, but I'm not allowed to talk."</TE>
<TE>   Q: "You're not allowed to talk?"</TE>
<TE>   A: "I don't talk."</TE>
<TE>   Q: "You can't talk?"</TE>
<TE>   A: "No, I can't talk."</TE>
<TE>   She speaks but she doesn't talk.</TE>
<TE>   Herold Hospitalized,</TE>
<TE>   Cancels Show</TE>
<TE>   "I had to throw in the towel," said designer Oliver Christian
Herold via cell phone from his hospital bed at Beth Israel, referring
to dropping out of Fashion Week.</TE>
<TE>   A stockbroker by day for Quick &amp; Reilly/Fleet Securities Inc.,
Herold, 30, checked himself into the hospital a week before his
Tuesday show after suffering sharp pains in his stomach and coughing
up blood.</TE>
<TE>   "I just started shaking like crazy at work and went home, where I
thought I could sweat it off." Herold had been directing show
preparations from his hospital bed while receiving food and medicine
intravenously. When he learned the doctor's diagnosis, acute
pancreatitis, he canceled the show.</TE>
<TE>   "My health matters most right now, " said Herold, who says he will
need time to build his strength for gall bladder surgery March 1. "I
think we had a fantastic collection to show this time but I just
couldn't delegate anymore from the bed. It became too overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   He says he'll investigate the possibility of showing during Los
Angeles' Fashion Week in April. "This just took me by storm," he
said. "But I'm not giving up. Like they say, the show must go on and
somehow, it will."</TE>
<TE>   Sexy Little Number</TE>
<TE>   Right Off Melrose</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Rojas, who last presented a collection here four years ago
for the now-defunct F-8 label, is back showing his first collection
for Private Clothing, whose Barcelona-based parent company Milcap
Media Group is best known for its adult entertainment videos.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old L.A.-based designer's line includes tasseled
fringed tops, fleece bustiers and ribbed low-slung pants. Already,
Rojas said, Britney Spears has bought a sexy number he has tagged his
"little hooker jacket" even though the line isn't in stores yet.</TE>
<TE>   The West Covina High School graduate, who claims celebrity clients
such as Janet Jackson, Madonna, Mary J. Blige and Christina Aguilera,
said that on March 1 his Melrose Avenue shop, called Rojas, which has

Amparo and Arturo Rojas, who both worked in the bridal industry. "I'd
help my grandma Antonia put pearls on wedding gowns while we watched
television together. Or I'd cut up pieces of fabric or take sleeves
off of shirts and glue them back differently." He pauses and then
adds: "I'm still doing that."</TE>

<HD>Smoothing Out Problems With Woolens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I don't know what to do with my woolen tops. If
I hang them up, they get those pointy shoulder thingies, even if the
hanger is padded or shaped. If I fold them, they get a crease in
bizarre places, even if I'm careful and fold them the way I see them
done in stores. What to do?</LD>
<LD>   Also, I don't have any moths yet, but do you have any suggestions
for eliminating them if they do show up?</LD>
<LD>   --WOOL YOU HELP ME?</LD>
<TE>   Dear Wool: First things first. You should never hang stretchy
knits of any kind since gravity ultimately takes its toll, resulting
in misshapen clothes. Better to let them lie flat in a drawer.</TE>
<TE>   If you do have to fold them, creases can be minimized by placing a
piece or two of acid-free tissue paper between the folds of the
garment. This will help prevent those sharp wrinkles (acid-free
tissue paper can be found at art supply stores.).</TE>
<TE>   During warmer months it's best to loosely pack woolens in closed
garment bags or plastic containers to discourage moths, and make sure
you clean the woolens before tucking them in.</TE>
<TE>   If that's not possible, make sure you take them out of the drawers
every few weeks and check for moth holes. When you put the clothes
back in the drawer, make different folds to prevent creases in the
same places.</TE>
<TE>   If you keep your wool clothing in wooden drawers, never place the
clothes directly on the wood. Line your drawers with acid-free paper
first. Wood often has acids, oils and finishes that can leech into
clothing.</TE>
<TE>   As for those pesky moths, we consulted with Ron Leuschner, a
research associate at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County and a lepidopterist (that's an expert on butterflies and
moths, for those of you who flunked biology). Besides storing your
woolens in a closed container, he suggests also using cedar wood
blocks or dried lavender to repel the insects.</TE>
<TE>   Mothballs will work, but the smell is most unpleasant and, if
inhaled routinely, can cause respiratory problems.</TE>
<TE>   Leuschner says tiny moths lay eggs on the garments. After they
hatch as caterpillars--they're so tiny that you can't see them--they
munch on your clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "One species that lives in Southern California appears as a little
puff of orange-brown," he says. "A moth with a reasonable size to it,
one-half-inch to five-eighths-inch wingspan, is probably a grain moth
that's eating your cereal."</TE>
<TE>   Store your woolens properly, check them periodically, and chances
are you'll enjoy them for years.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I want to add one more pair of jeans to my
struggling wardrobe, a comfy and cute pair of ankle-length, boot-cut
jeans. I am trying to look put-together, yet stylish (aren't we
all?).</TE>
<TE>   Work requires clothes I can function in and even get dirty. I'm 36
and want to stay age-appropriate. I am blessed with a tall, slender
build.</TE>
<TE>   I guess my question is, may I embrace the cut as my look and not
be out of fashion in a minute with the myriad choices out there?
Jeans these days are an investment.</TE>
<TE>   --UNSURE</TE>
<TE>   Dear Unsure: Honestly, so much distress over a pair of jeans!
True, there are about a zillion different styles of denim all vying
for space in our closets, and it's tough to figure out which to go
for. While the low-low-rise still abounds for the Britney-age crowd,
there are still classic looks for purists, skintight and wide-leg
styles, and trendy touches like faux fur accents, studded
embellishments and crochet trim.</TE>
<TE>   So if ankle-length boot-cut jeans do it for you, slap down that
credit card and go for it. We'll bet that style will stick around for
a while, unlike some of the more out-there designs that are passe by
the time you step out of the dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   Though jeans can cost in the hundreds of dollars, we found a few
boot-cut styles for $50 and under. At 501USA.com there are stretch
Levi's in black for $49.99 (www.501usa.com, or call [800] 794-5824).
L.L. Bean has boot-cuts with a natural waistline for $36
(www.llbean.com, or call [800] 441-5713). Nordstrom.com carries DKNY
slim-leg stretch boot-cut jeans for $48 (www.nordstrom.com, or call
[888] 282-6060).</TE>

<HD>The Day the Dragon Danced</HD>
<DH>Part 5 The story so far: Charles and Grandma have come to
see the Chinese New Year's Parade. Charles wants to see the dragon
dance but hasn't done so yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAY HAUGAARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dragon curved from one side of the street to the other, but he
still didn't dance.</LD>
<LD>   Gradually his legs started working together. He jumped on one
side, then the other. Clang, clang, boom, boom, went the cymbals and
drum. It was almost a dance. The dragon's long body rippled up and
down like bright sunset waves. He bounced back and forth with the
drums. His front feet turned to one side, then to the other. He
raised his huge head to all the people. He waved his pointed tail in
the air. He rolled his huge eyes and showed his huge teeth. His mouth
was big enough to swallow the sun. The dragon was dancing.</LD>
<LD>   "Now, isn't that something." Grandma laughed as she bounced back
and forth too.</LD>
<TE>   "See, Grandma, see, he's following the sun."</TE>
<TE>   "Sun, hah? That fancy red ball thing that man's holding on a stick
is the sun?"</TE>
<TE>   Grandma and I followed the dragon as he wiggled and danced all the
way down the block and around the corner. The dragon danced right
into a parking lot and stopped. Then out stepped my daddy and Mr.
Chu, who owns the grocery store on the corner, and Mr. Johnson, who
has the barbershop, and Mr. Feng, who owns the video store, and Mr.
Gonzalez, who teaches fifth grade at our school, and Dr. Ito, who
fixes my teeth. They all wore yellow satin suits and red socks and
athletic shoes. They took out the poles they had used to hold up the
dragon.</TE>
<TE>   "The dragon didn't dance together so well at first," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all right, sugar," said Grandma, "they did pretty good for
just starting out. It takes a while to learn to dance together."</TE>
<TE>   I ran over to Daddy, and he stooped down and hugged me. Grandma
came up behind me and smiled at everyone. "Happy New Year," she said.
"Gung hay fat choy."</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: Just as in real life, it can take a while to learn
to dance together. The same goes for work and play. Chinese New Year
began Tuesday, but the celebration lasts for about 15 days. There
will be a parade in Chinatown tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.comkids.
A new five-part story begins on Monday.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH A. BOSCO</AU>
<BD>Joseph A. Bosco teaches a graduate seminar in
China-Taiwan relations at Georgetown University's School of Foreign
Service.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush will face many opportunities and dangers when he
visits Asia next week. Some of his words at home already have caught
the world's attention and will follow him on his travels to China,
South Korea and Japan. His inclusion of North Korea in an "axis of
evil" and his statement that the United States will do "whatever it
takes" to defend Taiwan clearly resonate in Asia.</LD>
<LD>   This trip, however, affords the president a chance to reinforce
his important messages to doubters at home and abroad in a
historically significant context.</LD>
<LD>   His first priority doubtless will be the global campaign against
terrorism. North Korea already is seen as recklessly dispensing
weapons of mass destruction and missile technology. The president
surely will not back away from publicly restating his concerns about
that threat and his intentions to address it.</LD>
<TE>   But as National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said in
defending Bush's vivid State of the Union language, there are other
countries in the axis. Russia and China are the world's worst
proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and missiles, with North
Korea, Iraq and Iran among their customers.</TE>
<TE>   In his own folksy way, President Bush can deliver a serious
message and challenge Chinese President Jiang Zemin to line up fully
on the civilized world's side against terrorism. That means China
must finally stop allowing Chinese companies to sell dangerous
technology to states that engage in or sponsor terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Bush could also remind Jiang that although Washington welcomes
Beijing's cooperation in the anti-terrorism effort, limited as it has
been, the U.S. does not equate all who struggle for greater civil and
political rights in any country with the terrorists who use violence
to achieve their ends, particularly against innocent civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also should seek direct, uncensored access to the Chinese
people, either through a formal televised address or by live coverage
of an event similar to President Reagan's memorable speech to Russian
students.</TE>
<TE>   If given the opportunity, the president could start by telling
China and the world what U.S. policy is not: We do not see China as
an inevitable enemy or seek to contain its economic development or
rise to power on the world stage. U.S. policies ranging from
President Nixon's opening to China's recent accession to the World
Trade Organization have vigorously encouraged and supported those
trends.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. does not seek the breakup or disintegration of the
Chinese state. We support stability in China and the region
consistent with economic and political advancement.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. would support any resolution of the Taiwan question that
is achieved peacefully, without coercion and in accordance with the
wishes of the people of Taiwan. As long as China insists on deploying
missiles to threaten Taiwan, the U.S. will pursue a regional missile
defense system to protect against that and other threats (i.e., North
Korea).</TE>
<TE>   The United States will never abandon its moral and political
commitment to the cause of democracy and human rights. The United
Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees them, and
no civilization, no matter how ancient, can long deny or resist that
feature of the modern world. The people of Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan have demonstrated that Asian values can coexist with human
rights.</TE>
<TE>   The world has changed dramatically since Nixon's historic trip 30
years ago--the anniversary China wants to celebrate with the Bush
visit. But one thing has not changed since the tragic days of Mao
Tse-tung: the virulent anti-American tone in so much official and
quasi-official Chinese literature. By maintaining a simmering level
of aggrieved nationalism, the government can exploit it at times of
tension, such as the embassy bombing in Belgrade and the spy plane
incident in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   If we are not to view China as an enemy, we have a right to expect
China's reciprocation. Speaking plainly on these matters can
strengthen the hands of the moderates in China and advance the cause
of peace and democracy in Asia. That would be a signal achievement
for any traveling American president.</TE>

<HD>More Money for Spare Tires and Thirsty Soldiers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILLIP CARTER</AU>
<BD>Phillip Carter, who attends UCLA Law School, was a
captain in the Army's military police from 1997 to 2001.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was a military police platoon leader, I wanted to buy spare
tires for all seven of my platoon's Humvees. Spare tires made them
more effective in combat exercises because troops could change a tire
after running over a rock or barbed wire rather than wait for a
maintenance vehicle to come forward with a new tire.</LD>
<LD>   But a Humvee tire cost $623, and there was no money in my unit's
budget for spares. Or for Camelbaks, the water carriers that my
soldiers wanted to help them stay hydrated in the field. Or for extra
bullets to train above and beyond our military police gunnery
requirements. Or even for professional law enforcement gear such as
handcuff cases and pistol belts, although after begging our
division's chief of staff, we finally got $18,000 to purchase those.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's increases in defense spending aim to correct
these critical shortfalls at the soldier level--shortfalls that in
combat may make the difference between life and death.</LD>
<TE>   After the Gulf War, the military rightfully downsized to give
nation a post-Cold War peace dividend. But in the mid- to late-1990s,
the United States undertook dozens of deployments for missions from
peacekeeping to partnership with former Soviet republics. On any
given day, U.S. troops serve in dozens of nations, on the cutting
edge of Washington's foreign policy of global interdependence.</TE>
<TE>   One aim of downsizing was to trim a lot of the fat out of military
budgets. Civilian positions at base gyms and other facilities were
eliminated. These positions were replaced by soldiers on detail from
combat units, which had a tremendously destructive effect on unit
cohesion, training and overall readiness for combat.</TE>
<TE>   My crusty old sergeants liked to reminisce about the good old days
under President Reagan. In those days, they shot their personal
weapons at least once a month and their larger weapons once a
quarter. You see, marksmanship is a highly perishable skill. If you
don't practice the ability to put steel on target, you lose that
ability. Today, most military units qualify with their weapons just
once or twice a year.</TE>
<TE>   Spare parts also became more scarce. A mechanized force of tanks,
armored vehicles and wheeled vehicles is expensive. Fixing them when
they break requires entire battalions of support personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The budgets for unit maintenance have shrunk, and the materiel
readiness of those units has declined as well. In many low-level
units, vehicles not immediately needed sit idle in the motor pool
because they lack parts for repairs. Whenever large units are alerted
for deployment, a race begins to fix these dead vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   That brings me back to my Humvee tires.</TE>
<TE>   My platoon did more training in 2000 than any other military
police platoon at Ft. Hood, Texas, the Army's largest installation. I
suspect we spent more money on parts than any of our counterparts
too. But in the end, $4,361 for seven spare tires was too much to
spend. So we had to wait for maintenance, wasting hours of valuable
training time every time we blew a tire in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Giving the military $48 billion more this year and increases in
subsequent years will go a long way toward relieving chronic
shortages.</TE>
<TE>   More important, it will save commanders from making painful
choices between funding for gyms and housing versus funding for
training.</TE>
<TE>   Our military's success in war depends on its training in peace. We
must give the military enough money so that it can streamline and
modernize while not neglecting the lieutenants, sergeants and
soldiers who must go into harm's way.</TE>

<HD>Tyson-Lewis Fight Would Help Get L.A. Off the Mat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL CONTRERAS and JACK KYSER</AU>
<BD>Miguel Contreras is executive secretary of the Los
Angeles County Federation of Labor AFL-CIO. Jack Kyser is chief
economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>However you feel about Mike Tyson, holding the proposed fight between
Tyson and heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in Los Angeles would be
good for L.A. It would generate more than $100 million in revenue to
the region while putting thousands of people back to work.</LD>
<LD>   This sporting event is going to happen somewhere. Other states
have shown a strong interest in staging it, including Georgia, which
has already granted Tyson a license to fight there. These states are
not willing to sacrifice the substantial economic benefits during
these difficult economic times.</LD>
<LD>   Until the matters of Tyson's personal behavior are adjudicated,
that should not be a factor in determining whether he should be
licensed to box in the state of California.</LD>
<TE>   California's economy has languished along with the rest of the
country since Sept. 11. Especially hard hit have been the local
tourism and service sectors. Los Angeles is particularly affected
because of its reliance on foreign tourists, who accounted for nearly
one-third of the $13.6 billion spent by visitors in 2000. The region
has responded by attempting to increase tourism from within
California and nearby states. Though this effort has had some
success, what better way to give the local tourism sector a shot in
the arm than to host an event that is expected to bring in millions
of dollars in revenue, fill thousands of empty hotel rooms and draw
local and international media attention.</TE>
<TE>   In December, downtown Los Angeles hotels experienced their worst
month of business since the recession and civil unrest in 1992, with
occupancy rates under 27%. These hotels need a 60% occupancy rate
just to break even.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, as many as 2,000 unionized hotel workers and several
hundred nonunion service workers have been laid off. That translates
to about 40% of the county's unionized hotel workers who have been
laid off or who have had their hours substantially reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The effects are crippling to a working family struggling to make
it even in a strong economy.</TE>
<TE>   It was recently reported that next year's budget for the city of
Los Angeles is predicted to have a $250-million shortfall, in part
because of a drop in tourism. This deficit will affect the city's
ability to deliver essential services.</TE>
<TE>   Events such as this championship fight will fill those empty hotel
rooms, put service employees back to work and translate into
additional revenue from fans patronizing local restaurants, retail
stores, small businesses and other local attractions. The event is
also guaranteed to attract international media attention, sending the
message that L.A. remains one of the top entertainment destinations
in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The past few months have been a trying time for our country as
well as for our region. We have responded in a proud manner. While
the economy appears to be slowly rebounding, we should continue to
work together to return the region to full economic health.</TE>
<TE>   Let's focus this debate on what it is really about: Stimulating
our economy and bringing jobs to our region.</TE>

<HD>A Lone Holdout Doesn't Stand a Chance on a Jury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA LaVALLY</AU>
<BD>Rebecca LaVally is a public policy researcher and
freelance writer in Sacramento. E-mail: rlavally @aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last November, I supplied the 12th vote to convict a man of kissing a
teenager. That was after telling my fellow jurors I couldn't do it.</LD>
<LD>   I thought the prosecution was harsh, cruel and a waste of public
resources. I quickly learned that a juror who bucks the majority in a
criminal trial comes under tremendous pressure to conform, not only
from fellow jurors but from the system itself.</LD>
<LD>   A judge can issue a "dynamite" order, sending a divided jury back
to deliberate with instructions intended to blast the holdout juror
into line with the reasoning of the majority. And the California
Supreme Court has ruled that jurors who follow their consciences
rather than a judge's instructions can be thrown off juries in the
midst of deliberations.</LD>
<TE>   Carried out in secret, behind locked doors, jury deliberations are
mysterious and unknowable to all who haven't participated. Jurors too
are kept in the dark, ignorant of any aspect of a case that isn't
offered as evidence, forbidden to research the law or discuss what
they hear until instructed by the judge.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent and especially tragic case, a federal judge in Santa
Ana sequestered jurors in a hotel and stripped them of cell phones,
televisions and other news sources so they wouldn't learn that one of
two defendants in a bankruptcy fraud case had committed suicide.
Jurors convicted the remaining defendant, the wife of the dead man,
the next day.</TE>
<TE>   In my case, the defendant was charged with lewd and lascivious
acts on the body of a minor. As we opened deliberations, I found
myself alone in being amazed that he was prosecuted simply for
"making out," fully clothed, with a teenager for 10 minutes--under a
law so obscure that it took four days in court for us to learn what
it was.</TE>
<TE>   True, the difference in their ages was startling. He was 31, still
living with his mom and attending community college. She was 15 years
and 10 months old, a heavyset girl who could have seemed older. They
met through friends.</TE>
<TE>   We learned that it's a crime in California to touch a 14- or
15-year-old with the intent of arousing passion if the person doing
the touching is at least 10 years older.</TE>
<TE>   If we believed the evidence--including the defendant's taped
admission of the necking--we had to vote guilty, the judge told us.
The teen's consent was not a defense and neither was the defendant's
apparent ignorance of her age.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't much to discuss," concluded one of my fellow jurors
as we began deliberations. Eleven hands shot up for a vote of guilty.</TE>
<TE>   I countered that I didn't think the case should have been
prosecuted in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, this is a ridiculous case," said another juror, "but it's
before us. We're sworn to uphold the law and we have no choice."</TE>
<TE>   Time dragged as other jurors--graciously, incredulously, then
contemptuously--disputed my view. Ultimately, I switched to "guilty"
because I didn't think I had a right to block their good-faith
efforts to carry out the law.</TE>
<TE>   Barring some appeal, the defendant will have to register for the
rest of his life as a sex offender, I later learned, meaning a
lifetime of public scorn for 10 minutes of misdemeanor bad judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way it [a jury] can be the conscience of the community
is if it can be merciful in the very tiny number of cases where the
law in an individual case, if applied as written, will cause
injustice," Santa Clara University law professor Alan Scheflin, who
has written extensively on the subject, told me.</TE>
<TE>   Yet our system weeds out citizens of conscience, leaving juries
with only those who say they can vote to uphold the law whether they
agree with it or not. As Scheflin puts it, those sworn in "are more
likely to convict because they're more obedient to authority."</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, I wish I'd been stronger, more persuasive. Still,
if other jurors had complained to the judge that I was ignoring
evidence, would I have been removed?</TE>
<TE>   In our family, there are four grown children; the oldest is 31.
God forbid that he or any of the others land on the mean side of an
overzealous prosecutor. If it does happen, may God give them jurors
of conscience.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sex and Britney Spears go together like the little bubbles in
Coca-Cola. One ingredient sells the other. So for Spears to be
playing the virginal valedictorian of her high school class is a
little like Carson Daly starring in a remake of "Goodbye, Mister
Chips."</LD>
<LD>   That said, "Crossroads" is no "Glitter." Spears acquits herself as
well as anyone might, in a movie as contrived and lazy as this one.
She has a natural screen presence and, despite all those irritating
vocal tics, makes herself likable. This may come as a shock, but
she's OK.</LD>
<LD>   Before going any further, however, into why "Crossroads" does or
doesn't work, some of her fans would probably like to know what she
does and/or doesn't wear. The wardrobe highlights are as follows:</LD>
<TE>   Boy's-style underpants with midriff-baring T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Knee-highs, with miniskirt, and midriff-baring T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Pink silk-and-lace bra and panty ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Bath towel.</TE>
<TE>   This will be more than enough of an endorsement for most potential
"Crossroads" audiences. Others may want to know that Taryn Manning
and Zoe Saldana, who play the two estranged childhood friends of
Spears' character, Lucy, are first rate (Manning was one of the more
interesting things about "crazy/beautiful"). And that Anson Mount, as
the mysterious hunk who drives the three to California, is a nascent
superstar. But it's Spears' movie, of course. As Lucy, the
overprotected, over-encouraged daughter of a Louisiana garage
mechanic (Dan Aykroyd, collecting another paycheck), she is pining
for something fresh in her life, which does not include a first-time
sexual encounter with her lab partner of three years ("This isn't how
I expected it to be," she says, begging off. "This is exactly how I
expected it to be," he begs.)</TE>
<TE>   When the pregnant Mimi (Manning) says she's heading out to L.A.,
post-graduation, to take part in a recording company's open audition
(one of the several things in the film that simply doesn't make much
sense), the other two go along, somewhat concerned that Ben (Mount),
their driver, is rumored to have done time for murder. .</TE>
<TE>   Along the way to the West they suffer a more-than-predictable
series of mishaps, including a broken radiator on Ben's '66 Buick
Skylark convertible (which got me a lot more excited than Spears) and
a performance in a karaoke bar in which Mimi, the alleged performer,
suffers a case of crippling stage fright. Lucy takes the mike, covers
Joan Jett, and the patrons cough up enough cash not only to fix the
car but also to rent a hotel room with an actual minibar.</TE>
<TE>   "Crossroads" is one of those thankless projects that directors
usually take on so they can do something else. Tamra Davis, who
directed the Drew Barrymore picture "Guncrazy" back in '92, as well
as the hilarious "CB4," is capable of much better than this, but
perhaps the idea was just to get out of Spears' way.</TE>
<TE>   Good idea. When Lucy says, in a moment of uncharacteristic
megalomania, "Why don't I just do something for myself for once?" You
want to ask her "Who are you? Mother Teresa?" At the same time, of
course, you're just happy she isn't Mariah Carey.</TE>

<HD>Respect, Please, for the Family Art of Belly Dancing</HD>
<DH>Dance* Mother and daughter Tonya and Atlantis hope their
competitions and classes help diminish the stigma linked to the
activity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Scandalous!" the Chicago newspapers proclaimed in reports from the
World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. American impresario Sol Bloom
purportedly shocked Victorian America--in order to boost ticket
sales, of course--with his star attraction, a dancer called Little
Egypt. And to make sure audiences lined up to be scandalized, he
dubbed her undulating performance "belly dance."</LD>
<LD>   Since then, belly dancing has been described as a dance of power,
a dance of energy, a dance of dignity. It has been misconstrued,
mocked and, in some instances, maligned.</LD>
<LD>   Fast-forward a century to Tonya and Atlantis, a mother-daughter
belly-dancing duo trying to resurrect the form one class and one
performance at a time. This weekend, they'll take their efforts
public at their 12th annual Belly Dancer of the Universe Competition
in Long Beach. The two-day festival offers everything the belly
dancer needs--workshops and competitions, videos and costumes for
sale ("one size fits most")--and culminates in a gala show on Sunday
night.</LD>
<TE>   On a recent chilly Saturday morning in a stark Santa Monica
College classroom, mama Tonya teaches about 40 women to isolate their
torsos, shimmy seductively and flutter their hips in the ancient
dance that was once performed by Middle Eastern women at family
celebrations and that originated as a means of strengthening and
controlling abdominal muscles to prepare for childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   As the sounds of an oud, the North African instrument akin to a
lute, pour from a portable stereo, Atlantis, herself a performer and
teacher, joins the group. The multitude of hip scarves, adorned with
fringe, lace and coins, create their own sound collage; the many
colored veils--pale pink, saffron, deep blue--seem to float over the
quivering bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Weaving Patterns and Staying Fit</TE>
<TE>   You don't want to stick your breasts out, instructs Tonya, whose
offstage name is Antonia Chianis. "You're elongating the body. The
dance serves us as we serve the dance," she continues. Her hands
weaving intricate patterns, her head bobbing from side to side, she
never misses a beat.</TE>
<TE>   It's beautiful and hypnotic, but for a lot of these students, also
a great way to stay fit. And, 31-year-old Kim Walters, an advertising
executive taking the class, said, "It's spiritually uplifting. It's
everything that's good about being a woman."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment could be Chianis' philosophy. Born in upstate New
York, the raven-haired teacher moved to Long Beach in the 1960s,
where she studied acting and dance, becoming by the '70s a fixture at
the now-defunct Sunset Boulevard hotspot Club Fez. Throughout the
'80s, she landed gigs in various harem reviews at Las Vegas' Aladdin
Hotel, but the glory days of belly dancing were on the wane.</TE>
<TE>   Wanting to help revive the art form, Chianis and daughter Antonia,
who calls herself Atlantis, organized a competition. The year was
1991. They studied the rules of competitions in other areas and set
the parameters for the Belly Dancer of the Universe.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep it broader as far as costuming, playing finger cymbals
and overall appeal. We have different categories, and we have judges
from the top fields of dance," Chianis said. Categories include
Egyptian, which Chianis describes as an "internalized" style of
dance, wherein the steps might be uniform but interpretation is
different. The Universal category is a combination of Turkish,
Persian and Old Arabic styles and is more improvisational. Finally,
there is the category known as Divine, for which dancers must have 20
years or more of experience. All the finalists dance to live music.</TE>
<TE>   New this year, Chianis says, are the drumming competition and
"belly rolling" (the pushing in and out of the diaphragm to create a
series of gyrations). For those who prefer for their bellies to
remain more stationary, there will be performances by their troupe,
Tonya and Atlantis With Veils and Incense, and by Essence of Veils,
their student company.</TE>
<TE>   It's About Family, not Exploitation</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that 19th century scandal, the event is a
family-friendly affair. The mother-daughter team points that up, and
clarinetist Andreas Tsianis underscores it: He is Tonya's husband and
Atlantis' father. Yet as the women strive to bring belly dancing back
into vogue, they find themselves fighting myths: that belly dancing
is exploitative, that it was invented to arouse men, that it's
essentially a striptease.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya and Atlantis think otherwise. Their competition features two
categories for children (ages 5 to 9 and 10 to 17), which Chianis
says are very popular. "It's family-oriented. When they danced in the
old countries, it was for picnics and parties. Mothers [here] fix
their kids' costumes and it's really cute."</TE>
<TE>   A lingering association--however misguided--with sex and strip
shows has kept belly dancing off-limits for many scholars, said
Anthony Shay, founder of Iranian folk dance company Avaz
International Dance Theatre. A book he recently co-edited with
Barbara Sellers-Young, "Belly Dance: Representation, Orientalism and
Harem Fantasy," counters the myths and is the first serious treatise
on the subject. It's to be published by Wesleyan University Press.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't looked at it seriously as a trans-global project in
which over a million women in the U.S. in the '80s were
participating, as a hobby and a profession," he said. "It was
attached to the women's liberation movement, in which women felt
empowered to use their bodies in a way that had not been possible
before."</TE>
<TE>   This dance form, which the French still call the danse du
venture--the dance of adventure--has changed Chianis' life. She is
vice president of the Eastern Culture and Dance Assn. beach cities
chapter, of which her daughter is president, and also spreads the
praise of belly dancing at Cerritos College and Golden West College.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been absolutely wonderful. I love sharing it. It can be a
woman's best friend, and it's a tremendously healing experience
because it offers total escapism. It makes you believe in yourself."</TE>
<TE>   "And," she adds with a laugh, "it beats going to the gym."</TE>

<HD>From Camera-Ready to Listener-Friendly</HD>
<DH>Former TV anchors Tracie Savage and Larry Carroll have
found their news niche as the drive-time voices of KFWB-AM.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Carroll and Tracie Savage are familiar faces on the local
television news scene. But the two veteran anchor-reporters now
prefer to be heard and not seen.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll and Savage both say they have been rejuvenated since
joining forces as the evening drive-time anchors on KFWB-AM (980).
The two have been working the 3 to 8 p.m. shift together since
mid-September 2001 and are still amused when they are "found" by
listeners who recognize them from their TV days.</LD>
<LD>   "The response is, 'Oh, we finally found you,'" Savage said with a
laugh during an interview at the station. "They say it's like getting
back in touch with an old friend."</LD>
<TE>   The teaming of Carroll and Savage brings a positive twist to their
respective involuntary exits from TV news. Savage, who had worked at
KNBC-TV Channel 4 for the last seven years as a reporter and weekend
anchor, was let go last year along with several others in a major
shakeup and restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll's comeback is even more dramatic. He had largely been off
the airwaves since 1999, when he faced felony fraud charges,
including conspiracy and securities fraud. While Carroll was engaged
in his legal battle, his contract expired at KCBS-TV Channel 2, where
he was an afternoon anchor, and management decided not to rehire him
at his $330,000-a-year position. A San Bernardino County judge
dismissed the charges in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In landing at the all-news radio station, the two seasoned
veterans--both equally comfortable sitting behind an anchor desk or
doing a quick live remote report--had to start all over again, in
some respects, to adapt to journalism without pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio is just a totally different beast, and I had to use totally
different skills," said Savage. "We are literally on the edge of our
seats. Every second, there are four decisions that have to be made.
There is just so much that goes on."</TE>
<TE>   Added Carroll, "A TV reporter or anchor is only one part of a
program. Here, we are the entire engine. We deliver the copy, we do
the sound, we produce the show, we do the commercials. We're
developing new stories."</TE>
<TE>   But the more frenzied world of radio has also brought them welcome
surprises. "I love the freedom that radio affords," Carroll said. "It
all comes down to the words. There's no need to get a crew or worry
about how we look."</TE>
<TE>   "And there's no worry about getting somewhere in traffic," added
Savage.</TE>
<TE>   Another advantage, Savage quipped, is strictly financial: "I have
barely any casual clothes. I have about 200 suits in my closet that I
used for being on camera. Now I don't have to look a special way. And
it's nice that I save a lot of money on makeup."</TE>
<TE>   Making the transition was easier for the TV veterans because they
had each other to lean on. Landing at KFWB represents a reunion for
Carroll and Savage, who were among the first hired at KCAL-TV Channel
9 in 1991, when that station was launching its three-hour prime-time
news block.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to sit next to each other at KCAL," said Carroll. "Now
we're sitting across from each other."</TE>
<TE>   "We totally depend on each other, and carry each other," Savage
said.</TE>
<TE>   They also share a similar perspective on moving from the more
glamorous, high-profile TV news to the relative obscurity of radio,
citing what they see as negative trends in the former medium.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't feel that there's a reduction in status," Savage
said. "More importantly, television news has changed a lot. There are
not the high journalistic standards that existed in previous years.
Now, it's the pictures first, and the story is second. The video
defines the story. With our newscasts, you get solid news all the
time, and I think that brings a lot of respect. And it's nice to work
in a medium where experience and reputation matter. When you look at
TV, it's clear that doesn't matter as much."</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to find stories about birthday parties for house
cats on our news," said Carroll. "When the story or the facts change,
we can change with them."</TE>
<TE>   Still, both say they harbor no bitterness toward their former
stations.</TE>
<TE>   "I left in the middle of a lot of bloodletting," Savage said. "I
didn't take it personally. There was a mandate to cut costs, and it
was clear that highly paid people whose contracts were up would be
very vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   As for Carroll, he said he was delighted not only that the charges
against him were dismissed, but that he now has an opportunity to
explore other areas--and see his two young children grow--after a few
decades at KABC-TV Channel 7, KCAL and a stint at NBC News.</TE>
<TE>   KFWB General Manager Roger Nadel said having Carroll and Savage on
the station "has renewed in the minds of our staff KFWB's commitment
to attract quality people. They both are at the highest levels. They
have voices that are familiar enough to be comforting. [And] they can
paint those words pictures."</TE>
<TE>   Because radio ratings are issued quarterly, it's difficult to
track the impact their arrival has had; still, Carroll expressed
confidence that the audience is responding.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there are more people listening to us now than ever saw
us on TV," he said, smiling. "After all, we're on for five hours a
day."</TE>

<HD>From One Screen to Another</HD>
<DH>Movies* Though different in many ways, the Oscar nominees
for animated feature use the same basic computer technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The star of "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius" is an inventor, part
Einstein, part Bart Simpson. He blows a gum bubble big enough to
float him to school when he misses the bus. He creates a pair of
pants that put themselves away at the end of the day, and he builds a
toaster that ejects slices of browned bread at rocket speed.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this week, the powers that be in the entertainment
industry applied some of their own special chemistry, nominating the
movie for best animated feature, a new Oscar category that includes
two much bigger films, "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc."</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, the relatively low-cost "Jimmy Neutron's" box-office
performance, at $78 million and counting, has impressed Nickelodeon
and Paramount enough that they've greenlit a sequel, in addition to
the upcoming TV series.</LD>
<TE>   For the creators of "Jimmy Neutron," Tuesday's announcement
validates work that began on a handful of desktop computers in Dallas
and eventually drew a comparatively small $30-million budget from
Nickelodeon and Paramount.</TE>
<TE>   "And we stayed on budget. We didn't have a lot of creative
cushion," said Steve Oedekerk, "Jimmy Neutron's" lead writer. "That's
a real number. I know animated movies have a huge track record of
undercutting their budget and saying it was less than it was."</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks SKG put up $60 million for "Shrek," and Disney and
Pixar bankrolled "Monsters, Inc." with $115 million. "Jimmy
Neutron's" budget wasn't its only small-scale approach. It was the
brainchild of six animators working on Lightwave 3-D rendering
software by Newtek.</TE>
<TE>   Once Paramount and Nickelodeon came on board, the team of
animators grew to 120.</TE>
<TE>   "But," Oedekerk said, "the model stayed the same: goosed-up home
computers with off-the shelf software to make the movie."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, "Shrek" was built in state-of-the-art DreamWorks
studios, and "Monsters, Inc." came from Disney and Pixar, whose
signature velvety 3-D look mesmerized audiences of both "Toy Story"
movies and "A Bug's Life."</TE>
<TE>   "DreamWorks and Pixar have the same equipment, and they write
their own software that enables our characters to communicate
emotions with a subtle facial expression," said Andrew Adamson, one
of the directors of "Shrek."</TE>
<TE>   Even with the disparity in finances and technology, "Jimmy
Neutron," "Monsters, Inc." and "Shrek" are bound by the technique of
computer-generated imagery, or CGI, unlike animated films that used
the traditional cel images, like "Atlantis: The Lost Empire," or
stop-motion clay animation, like "Chicken Run."</TE>
<TE>   "I was so proud of the filmmakers who made 'Jimmy Neutron,'" said
executive producer of "Monsters, Inc." John Lasseter, a director of
the "Toy Story" films and "A Bug's Life."  Speaking from his home in
Sonoma, Lasseter said, "'Jimmy Neutron' is testament that access to
'materials' bring more sophisticated competition to the market.</TE>
<TE>   "What's exciting is that these tools are available to everyone,"
he said. "No longer is the excuse that you don't have access to the
tools. With the Macintosh, you can get all this 3-D animation
software....</TE>
<TE>   "My goal has been to get these tools in the hands of more artists,
in the way that if you get oil paints and canvas in the hands of
different artists, look at the art you get."</TE>
<TE>   It allows, he said, for spontaneity outside of Hollywood's food
chain, which is exactly how "Jimmy Neutron" came to the big screen.
Oedekerk, 41, read about a character named Jimmy Quasar who had been
created by a team of animators at a company in Dallas called DNA
Productions Inc. Oedekerk cold-called DNA and asked if he could help
develop the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "They were out doing local car commercials in Dallas," Oedekerk
said. "Cut to five years later, we're the David and Goliath aspect of
the third choice."</TE>
<TE>   Well, not exactly. Although its origins were humble and its budget
relatively small, "Jimmy Neutron" was backed by the muscle of two
arms of a media conglomerate that launched full-blown campaigns to
influence voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   "I called all my friends," joked Albie Hecht, president of
Nickelodeon and executive producer of "Jimmy Neutron," who added that
"Paramount really put on a very classy for-your-consideration
campaign. It wasn't overblown hype. It was very classy."</TE>
<TE>   Oedekerk says this year's new category and the ability of a little
squirt named Jimmy to stand aside expensive green ogres and blue
monsters bodes well for creativity.</TE>
<TE>   "We are approaching a day when six kids are buddying up in the
house and coming up with a brilliant television show," he said over
the British-accented alto voice of a GPS system in his Range Rover.
After the synthetic voice instructed him to "please, move left to the
motorway," Oedekerk apologized for the computer's interruption.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology will never negate the need for talent," he said. "It
allows people to play a game that previously they never would have
been able to play."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Oedekerk and DNA are preparing their brainchild for his
weekly TV series debut on Nickelodeon in the fall. As for his movie
career, "Jimmy Neutron II" is planned for summer 2004. Keeping it
frugal, Hecht said the sequel will be made on roughly the same budget
as the first, but with a new batch of inventions and adventures in
Jimmy's hometown of Retroville.</TE>

<HD>Critics Pan Shutdown of MOMA's Movie-Stills Collection</HD>
<DH>Archive* New York art museum's decision to relocate, then
close, valued resource and lay off curatorial staff draws fire from
film community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>This city is known for a lot of things, but not as a movie town. Yes,
corporate heads and independent studios are based here, but the
business is not a staple of conversation, nor is it a large part of
the local economy. If anything, movies are regarded as a cultural
artifact--Hollywood viewed from afar by critics, journalists,
scholars, programmers and other enthusiasts.Not much nasty in a
film-related way happens here--until now. Recently, New York's Museum
of Modern Art, which is moving its Manhattan operations to a former
factory in Queens while the museum undergoes a three-year,
$650-million renovation, announced that it is moving its renowned
film stills archive, which includes more than 4 million stills, many
of them found nowhere else, to Hamlin, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   As if that's not inaccessible enough, the museum laid off the two
women who helped build the collection and know it best, assistant
curator Mary Corliss and Terry Geesken, and then closed it
altogether. Suddenly everybody is up in arms. And this includes more
than a few big names.</LD>
<TE>   Critic Roger Ebert, whose new book, "The Great Movies," used the
archive and includes an essay by Corliss, wrote a letter to the New
York Times that said, "Film scholars and journalists need this
archive.... If the archive is not available to most of its users, of
what use is it?" Director Martin Scorsese, whose documentary "My
Voyage to Italy" included archive stills, said, "I can only hope, for
the cineastes here in New York who need access to the files, that
this is not permanent."</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you look at all the film books, it would be astounding
to see how many people thanked the archive," says Village Voice
critic J. Hoberman, who adds that he wouldn't have been able to
illustrate his books on film without it. Corliss' husband, Time
magazine film critic Richard Corliss, who admittedly has a personal
interest in the matter, wrote a wistful essay about the loss of the
collection. A protest was lodged by New York University's Tisch
School of the Arts' cinema studies department. A major stills donor
has said he's withholding further donations until Corliss returns.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to some of these protesters, museum President Agnes
Gund sent a form letter saying that the Hamlin facility "allows us to
store, preserve and research our collections in ways that are simply
not possible to do on West 53rd Street in Manhattan." It goes on to
say, "It is in the best interests of the institution to relocate the
archive until the building project is complete."</TE>
<TE>   The letter neglects to mention that the archive is actually
closed, not just relocated, and that even if the archive were open,
the stills need to be physically accessible in ways that film, which
is also stored there, does not. The museum recently released a
statement saying, "The ongoing building project will require a
temporary contraction of services museum-wide, as well as a
retrenchment in staff, in order to realize the permanent expansion of
resources when the museum reopens in 2005. The two employees who were
laid off are eligible to receive severance pay, with an option for
recall rights, in accordance with their union contracts."</TE>
<TE>   The two employees are, of course, Corliss, who worked at the
museum for 34 years, and Geesken, who was there for more than 17
years. The principals allegedly responsible for these layoffs are
museum director Glenn Lowry and Mary Lea Bandy, chief curator of film
and media and deputy director of curatorial affairs. Corliss and
others suggest that she and Geesken were laid off and the collection
shut down because Lowry and Bandy were unhappy with their
participation in a strike that lasted more than four months during
the spring and summer of 2000. The museum denies this.</TE>
<TE>   According to Corliss, the stills archive originally was intended
to join the rest of the museum's collections in Queens. In fact, she
was supposed to sit down with the architect of the Queens facility to
discuss the archives' space when the strike intervened. Four months
later, in September 2000, when she returned to work, Corliss was told
that these plans had been put on hold. There the matter remained
until July 2001, when she was told that the collection would be moved
to Hamlin, about two hours from Manhattan. The facility has
state-of-the-art temperature and humidity controls, but there is no
space designated for the stills archive, so they are going to be
stored in filing cabinets in corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Curatorial Aides Targeted in Layoffs, One Charges</TE>
<TE>   Corliss says she and Geesken were willing to work with this
arrangement but that the museum wasn't willing to work with them. In
essence, she and others are suggesting that the museum wanted to get
rid of them so badly that it shut down the archives after the
inconveniences of the relocation failed to drive them out. They were
given their walking papers Jan. 9. Since by contract they were
allowed three weeks' notice and the museum wasn't scheduled to close
until May, Corliss assumed that she would have three weeks to clear
her desk and help pack up the archives. Instead, two days later she
and Geesken were handed three weeks' pay and told to clear out."The
museum has followed the usual procedures that any company, any
organization, follows in a layoff situation," Bandy said in an
interview this week, adding that it was known since last fall that
the archive would be temporarily shut down for relocation purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Bandy added, "It's my job to make sure everything is cared for,
and if there are different perceptions of that, I'm very regretful. I
think I've proven my record to people in my tenure at the museum, and
I'm very proud of it. When people have worked a long time in
institutions, everybody has different perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I've supported my staff. I'm very proud of the support of my
staff. That's really all I have to say."</TE>
<TE>   Few people in New York, except the museum staff itself, believe
that MOMA couldn't have found an acceptable alternative. After all,
unlike some museum departments, the archive seems to be a moneymaker.
It was also singled out in a press release issued in November 2000
from New York Gov. George Pataki announcing that the state was
contributing $5 million to the Queens facility. The governor's office
won't comment on whether the museum betrayed the spirit, if not the
letter, of the state's financial commitment by relocating the
archive--especially in light of the fact that businesses have been
encouraged to stay in New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The thinking is that MOMA, which is one of the most powerful
institutions in New York, can simply ride out the storm, though it
may very well face legal challenges. According to Maida Rosenstein,
president of Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers, of which the
Professional and Administrative Staff Assn. is a part, the union is
pursuing charges with the National Labor Relations Board that the
layoffs are in retaliation for strike activity.</TE>
<TE>   The museum entices subscribers and nonsubscribers alike with its
program of classic films--which doesn't quite square with its less
than reverential attitude toward the medium, at least according to
some observers.</TE>
<TE>   "Film has always been a stepchild of the museum," Time magazine
film critic Richard Schickel says. "And the stills archive has been a
stepchild of the film programming there."</TE>
<TE>   But Bandy takes issue with that sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "Any feelings that one department is orphaned more than any other
is simply not valid," she says. "The museum has vastly supported the
film department."</TE>
<TE>   Bandy won't say when the archive will be open again, but one thing
is certain: In accordance with the union contract negotiated with
renovation-related layoffs in mind, Corliss has opted to take a
smaller severance package in exchange for recall rights. In other
words, if and when MOMA reopens its stills archive, it will have to
give Corliss her old job back.</TE>

<LD>Roy Hargrove has a habit of coming on stage, picking up his trumpet
and instantly digging into a high-speed, note-filled solo. The
concept of warming up slowly, of building to a climax, doesn't seem
to have a place in his musical way of thinking.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday night at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, Hargrove once again
began "Public Eye," the first tune of his opening night, with the
same approach, lifting off immediately, soaring through a solo filled
with brilliantly articulate filigrees of melody, never touching down
until he had scoured every inch of his horn.</LD>
<LD>   Other tunes took a similar course, with Hargrove in full flight,
pausing only to give the other members of his quintet the opportunity
to match his fiery improvisational excursions. But they were rarely
able to rise to his level.</LD>
<TE>   Hargrove shifted down into cruise control during his choruses on
Fats Navarro's "Nostalgia," replacing the torrent of notes with more
melodically oriented phrasing. And when he pulled out his flugelhorn
to do some ballad work, an even gentler, more lyrical aspect of his
playing emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Hargrove has always been versatile, but as he has matured, he has
brought a seamless flow to his improvising, telling his musical
stories via a line that effortlessly expresses the complex passage of
his musical thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Not as much can be said for his quintet's overall musical
presentation. Recognizing that drummer Willie Jones III is a local
product, and that he had many friends in the crowd, Hargrove expanded
the drum solo segments in many of the tunes. A good idea for the
Jones fans, less intriguing to those who are perfectly happy to hear
only one extended percussion display per set.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was the energy level of the rhythm section (Jones, bassist
Dwayne Burno and pianist Eric Lewis) quite up to the level
established by Hargrove. Burno was solid and dependable, but not
quite into a grooving rhythmic pocket with Jones. And Lewis seemed
intent upon approaching every solo as a bell curve building to an
orgiastic, banging-on-the-keys climax. Alto saxophonist Jesse
Robinson tried hard to match Hargrove note for note, succeeding at
times, but without the vivacious musical intensity of his leader.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the gig, after all, was Hargrove's, and one can't fault the
ecstatic qualities of his playing. At 32, he has firmly established
himself as one of the important jazz voices of his generation.</TE>

<LD>When I mentioned to Bob Dylan during an interview in the late 1970s
that I was going to Nashville to see Waylon Jennings, Dylan said, "I
love Waylon. Why don't you get him to record one of my songs?"</LD>
<LD>   I thought the often enigmatic Dylan was kidding, but when I saw
him again three years later, the first thing he asked was, "What ever
happened with Waylon?"</LD>
<LD>   In retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised by Dylan's
affection. If I ever wrote a song, I'd want to write it like Bob
Dylan and then sing it like Waylon Jennings.</LD>
<TE>   Jennings, who died Wednesday at age 64, was the ultimate
honky-tonk hero--someone whose voice conveyed a confidence and
strength that made him (and our dreams) seem invincible, but also
found room for a trace of teardrop.</TE>
<TE>   You're going to see the words "tough," "rebellious" and "outlaw" a
lot in tributes to the West Texas native, but the quality that always
struck me most about Jennings was his tenderness.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the macho surface of all those songs that he and Willie
Nelson used to define the country "outlaw" movement of the '70s,
there was a vulnerability that gave the music a rare richness and
heart.</TE>
<TE>   One of Jennings' most popular recordings was "Amanda," a Bob
McDill song that Jennings performed so convincingly it was hard to
believe he didn't write it himself. The lines that got the most
applause:</TE>
<TE>   It's a measure of people who don't understand</TE>
<TE>   The pleasures of being in a hillbilly band</TE>
<TE>   I got my first guitar when I was 14</TE>
<TE>   Now I'm over 30 and I'm still wearing jeans.</TE>
<TE>   It was a great anthem because it captured the romance of the
outlaw movement, which was all about growing up without surrendering
youthful dreams. I've seen people raise a beer to those lines across
the country, from stadiums to honky-tonks.</TE>
<TE>   But another part of the song meant the most to Jennings and best
explains how he was able to inject a lyric with such deeply rooted
emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda, light of my life</TE>
<TE>   Fate should have made you</TE>
<TE>   A gentleman's wife.</TE>
<TE>   "That line hits hard every time I sing it," Jennings told me in
1990. "I think of Jessi."</TE>
<TE>   Jennings had been married for more than 20 years at that point to
singer-songwriter Jessi Colter, who set aside her own promising
career to stand at his side during long periods of career frustration
and cocaine addiction.</TE>
<TE>   "She was what made me finally quit [drugs]," he continued. "I
looked at her face one day, and I could see what I was doing to her,
the pain I was causing. Nothing else had been enough. ... The fact
that I almost ruined my voice, that I couldn't even see straight some
nights."</TE>
<TE>   Colter's love was a central theme in Jennings' life and his music.
She was his fourth wife, and he went through periods so dark that
most women would have given up. She's the one he wrote "Good Hearted
Woman" about, and the one he had in mind when he sang Lee Clayton's
"Ladies Love Outlaws."</TE>
<TE>   Colter's devotion not only helped Jennings tame his demons, but
also filled him with an inner richness that enabled him to bring a
deeper dimension to his music.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was a fan of Jennings from the moment I heard him in 1966. He
was third-billed on a country music tour featuring Hank Williams Jr.
and Loretta Lynn at the old Long Beach Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewing Williams backstage, I could hear this great voice
through the rickety old dressing room door. I didn't know anything
about Jennings, but I was so enthralled with the voice that I cut the
interview short and moved to the side of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Even in those early days, Jennings had the charisma of a young
Elvis Presley, and his rugged vocals had an authority and emotional
punch remindful of the best country and rock music. He grew up on
country, but he didn't limit himself to the old themes of trains and
prisons and mama's love.</TE>
<TE>   He sang about relationships and dreams in ways that enabled him to
reach out in the '60s to such unconventional pop and rock fare as the
Beatles' "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"--not as part of some
clever crossover campaign, but because he knew it was a good song.</TE>
<TE>   John Lennon later told me that it was one of his favorite versions
of a Beatles song.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't believe in 1966 that Jennings wasn't already a
superstar in Nashville. The problem was that he resisted the town's
old-fashioned way of doing things. They didn't like it when he wanted
to use his own band on records or pick the songs he would record, or
when he refused to wear rhinestone suits.</TE>
<TE>   By the early '70s, Jennings' spirit was broken. Despite a few Top
20 country hits, he was deeply in debt and drained emotionally. For a
moment in 1971, he even thought about quitting the business. "I
didn't really know what to do," he recalled years later in an
interview. "I just felt all burned out inside. I was really down, and
it felt like people were still trying to kick me."</TE>
<TE>   Again it was Colter who helped him find the strength to fight back
against the Nashville establishment--and with sidekick Willie Nelson,
he won big with the outlaw movement.</TE>
<TE>   Through such hits as "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be
Cowboys" and "Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)," the
pair drew millions of new fans to country music with real, inspiring
work.</TE>
<TE>   I was such a fan that I broke a Times rule in 1972 and wrote the
liner notes for Jennings' "Ladies Love Outlaws" album, figuring no
one at the paper would ever see it because Jennings wasn't known
outside of country music.</TE>
<TE>   In the notes, I recalled an evening in 1971 at the old Palomino
club in North Hollywood when Phil Spector, the legendary record
producer, was so excited by Jennings' performance that he stood and
cheered after every song.</TE>
<TE>   "He ought to have a No. 1 record every time," Spector shouted.</TE>
<TE>   And he was right.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings started heating up in Nashville in 1974 when he had two
No. 1 singles in a row. That same year, after a show one night in Las
Vegas, he played me a tape of his upcoming album, "The Ramblin' Man."
He was uncertain about which track to release as a single and asked
for a suggestion. I mentioned "Rainy Day Woman," a rousing,
feel-good, guitar-driven tune.</TE>
<TE>   When the single soared up the charts, Jennings called to thank me
for the suggestion, but I always felt a little guilty about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Rainy Day Woman" only went to No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Like Spector, I thought everything Jennings did in those days
should have been No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite diabetes-related health problems that resulted in the
amputation of his left foot in December, Jennings always counted his
blessings.</TE>
<TE>   The last time I saw him was about a year ago when he came to town
on business.</TE>
<TE>   We had breakfast at a hotel near the Beverly Center, and it was
painful to see this once-dynamic figure hobble from the elevator,
leaning on a cane for support. I tried to hide my surprise at his
condition, but he seemed to sense to my mood.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," he said. "I'm a lucky man. My dreams did come true."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No longer just fighting back, America is now talking back.</LD>
<LD>   Bring on those knee-jerk public-opinion polls and
yokel-on-the-street surveys mimicking hysterical responses from NBC
Sports commentators. Bring on talk shows and their easily exercised
hosts. Bring on volcanic, steam-shooting-from-ears outrage, the kind
we reserve for occasions that threaten the very soul of civilization.
Bring on CNN's Larry King, ever circumspect, proclaiming this epic
travesty of justice "the most talked-about story in the world."</LD>
<LD>   And why not?</LD>
<TE>   Yes, there is terrorism. Yes, there is Enron. But this, this is a
catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   "The Canadians were robbed 100%," someone said. "It was an
absolute national disgrace," someone else added. Said another:
"Everybody on the planet thought they should have won." Yup, all of
Earth remarkably of one mind.</TE>
<TE>   And so it went Tuesday and Wednesday on CNN's noontime chat show,
"TalkBack Live." As it did throughout much of television and the rest
of the media, where debate fixated on Monday's pairs figure skating
at the Winter Olympics, which found Russians Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze edging Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier
for the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   NBC commentators Scott Hamilton and Sandra Bezic--who had
confidently predicted gold for crowd favorites Sale and Pelletier
during and after their performance--cried foul.</TE>
<TE>   As I did, being devastated, ripped, incensed, seething with anger,
foaming with purple rage.</TE>
<TE>   When Sale and Pelletier skated on TV, I chanted, "Six! Six!,"
calling for the judges to give them the perfect score I was certain
they deserved, even though I knew zippo about skating. When their
marks came up, my heart broke for these Canadians whom I didn't care
about and had never heard of before that evening. I was embarrassed
for my country, even though my country had nothing to do with it. I
was embarrassed for my sport, even though figure skating wasn't my
sport. I endorsed Hamilton's and Bezic's fury, even though I had only
a vague notion of what they were talking about.</TE>
<TE>   And as the coverage and speculation about rigging billowed all
week--giving NBC's figure skating coverage free publicity that would
cost kadzillions to buy--I learned that Sale and Pelletier had lost
to a couple of clumsy palookas. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze didn't
have to exert effort on the ice because "they knew" they would win,
retiring U.S. Olympic skier Picabo Street assured Jay Leno on NBC
Wednesday night. So they were in on it, too, huh?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, echoing the nostalgic good old days of the Cold War, it was
the Russkies all over again, this time they and their "bloc"
sabotaging the Canadians. You know, our northern neighbors who look,
act and talk so much like us that they could be, well, junior or
almost-Americans.</TE>
<TE>   This is where we draw the line. Chechnyans are one thing. But
Russians must not be allowed to abuse almost-Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The gold medalists themselves were scheduled to address that
during a Thursday night appearance with King, whose Wednesday guests
had included the now globally famous Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   If all this appears overwrought ("We wuz robbed" being the mantra
of boxing, where biased judging is nearly a given), consider it a
function of quadrennial Olympic fever. It's during these periodic
diversions from reality that sports few of us ever think or hear
about suddenly assume cosmic importance through the prism of intense
media exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get back to curling in a moment," MSNBC promised when
breaking away for a news conference on the figure-skating flap
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The result of this laser focus? Instant experts everywhere,
millions of viewers temporarily speaking an alien tongue taught them
by TV, their heads Berlitzed with new sports terminology destined to
vanish from their radar as soon as the Games end.</TE>
<TE>   The experience is not unfamiliar. Typical in my house these days
are dialogues along these lines:</TE>
<TE>   "Look at that triple toe loop!"</TE>
<TE>   "Huge!"</TE>
<TE>   "And the quad toe, the double toe."</TE>
<TE>   "Sheer determination."</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever?"</TE>
<TE>   "Such heart, such spirit."</TE>
<TE>   "Such passion."</TE>
<TE>   "And that triple axel."</TE>
<TE>   "Gigantic!"</TE>
<TE>   "Would you believe that triple lutz?"</TE>
<TE>   "You mean double lutz."</TE>
<TE>   "I know a triple lutz when I see one."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, sure. Like you knew that step lift was a hand-to-hand loop
lift."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah? What about the death spiral you miscalled?"</TE>
<TE>   "I did say it was awesome."</TE>
<TE>   "But you called it a toe overhead lift."</TE>
<TE>   "You're confusing that with the waltz jump."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a throw jump."</TE>
<TE>   "Will you just look at that salchow."</TE>
<TE>   "Lovely rotation. So clean, so elegant."</TE>
<TE>   "That choreography--it takes my breath away."</TE>
<TE>   "And nice arc on that jump."</TE>
<TE>   "Then into a flying sit spin."</TE>
<TE>   "A camel, you mean."</TE>
<TE>   "A flying sit spin is not a camel."</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I'm saying."</TE>
<TE>   "Just look at that quad toe, triple toe."</TE>
<TE>   "Easy, effortless."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow!"</TE>
<TE>   "Was that a walley?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nah, inside axel."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, and about those toe picks....</TE>
<TE>   If this even approaches what's happening in other U.S. households
during this extended Olympic moment, it's no wonder that the foibles
of figure skating now crescendo so deafeningly in viewerdom. Nor will
controversy over subjective judging necessarily end with skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Judged best at this week's Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, in a
big surprise, was the miniature poodle, Surrey Spice Girl, edging the
heavily favored Kerry Blue terrier, Torums Scarf Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Was the fix in? Stay tuned.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Keep the Faith, Baby" was the rallying cry of Adam Clayton Powell
Jr. It's also the title of a Showtime movie that premieres Sunday
night with a jazz score by Todd Cochran.</LD>
<LD>   The assignment was both an inspiration and a challenge for the
veteran pianist-composer, whose track record includes work with
everyone from Aretha Franklin and Neil Diamond to the Staple Singers.</LD>
<LD>   Cochran's compositions have been recorded by Carlos Santana, Bobby
Hutcherson, Freddie Hubbard and others, and his most recent film
assignment (prior to "Keep the Faith, Baby") was as an orchestrator
and keyboardist for the 1999 Norman Jewison picture "Hurricane."</LD>
<TE>   "Film scoring is one of the three overlapping areas--along with
jazz and concert music--that are my primary focus," says Cochran.
"And the good thing about this assignment is that it demanded the use
of my skills in all those areas."</TE>
<TE>   Which is not surprising, given the complex qualities of the film's
subject. Charismatic and controversial, Powell (who is portrayed by
Harry Lennix) was a political and social lightning rod from the early
1940s well into the late '60s. As chairman of the House of
Representatives' education and labor committee, he was responsible
for an array of progressive social legislation. Powell was also
denied his seat in 1967 by a vote of the full House and eventually
vindicated by the Supreme Court in 1969 (although he did not receive
his back pay, seniority or chairmanship).</TE>
<TE>   Powell's connection with jazz was direct. His role as the minister
of the Abyssinian Baptist Church and his tenure in the House were
generated from a base in Harlem in the '40s and '50s at a time when
bebop was emerging to claim stylistic dominance over the jazz world.
In 1945, he married Hazel Scott, a fine bebop-based pianist famous
for her blending of jazz and classical music.</TE>
<TE>   "She's played by Vanessa Williams in the picture," says Coch- ran.
"And because there are a number of scenes in which she appears
playing both classical and jazz, I had the opportunity to provide
music from Bach and Beethoven as well as some jazz piano trio
selections."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran's score, which moves easily through the film's complicated
stylistic demands, was performed by an ensemble that includes
woodwind artist Bennie Maupin, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and
singer (from Take 6) Alvin Chea, whose rendering of "Straighten Up
and Fly Right" provides an important thematic element in the
underscore.</TE>
<TE>   "Powell was a very sophisticated man who entered into the
mythology of his time," says Cochran, "a mythology that we usually
think of only in terms of artists such as Jacob Lawrence and poets
like Countee Cullen. He was at the center of a vibrant era, with
creative and social currents flowing in all directions. From a
composer's point of view, it was a wonderful opportunity to dip into
those currents to create musical references to time and place. And
jazz was at the heart of it. Jazz is the music of America, and this
is a very American story."</TE>
<TE>   "Keep the Faith, Baby" airs on Showtime at 8 p.m. Sunday. It is
rated TV-14LD (may not be advisable for children under 14, with
additional advisories for strong language and dialogue).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grammy Jazz: It's unclear whether we'll be seeing yet another
Grammy Awards show with minimal jazz participation on Feb. 27. The
principal jazz awards will be presented during a pre-Grammy show
event and no jazz artists have been announced to perform in the
prime-time show.</TE>
<TE>   It's interesting to note, however, that the "orchestra" for the
production (actually a 13-piece ensemble conducted by
pianist-composer Mike Melvoin) will include some prime jazz talent.
Among the participants: trumpeters Oscar Brashear and Rick Baptist;
trombonist George Bohannon; saxophonists Ray Pizzi and Pete
Christlieb; keyboardists Tom Ranier and Melvoin.</TE>
<TE>   That's a sterling lineup by anyone's standards. But don't expect
to hear the kind of playing they do when they're in their best
improvisational modes. For the most part, the group will be working
on transitions and interludes composed by Melvoin in styles
reflecting the various major musical genres. One of those genres,
according to Melvoin, will be jazz, so the program will at least
offer some acknowledgement of America's music.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the Grammys, it's also interesting to take a look at
both the number of award categories allocated to jazz, as well as to
what they do and don't include.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz has six categories (including best Latin jazz album).
Composing/arranging has three categories, but it often serves as a
kind of backdoor route for jazz composers and arrangers to receive
awards, since the jazz field contains no categories devoted to jazz
compositions and arrangements. Of course, what this means is that
voters have to make the choice between odd juxtapositions.</TE>
<TE>   The best instrumental composition category, for example, pits
entries from the scores of "Cast Away" and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon" against a jazz selection from bassist John Patitucci's album
"Communion." That's not fair to any of the entries.</TE>
<TE>   The classical category, on the other hand, has a total of 11
Grammy Award areas, from best classical album to best classical
crossover album. That's nearly twice the number allocated to jazz,
despite the fact that--using record sales, one of the academy's most
popular yardsticks, as a measurement--jazz generally sells a higher
percentage of albums than classical (see "Numbers" below).</TE>
<TE>   Why the disparity? That's a hard question to answer, but it
probably dates back to a notion many jazz artists had decades ago,
that performing at Carnegie Hall, or with a string orchestra or a
symphony, somehow endowed their work with more legitimacy. European
concert music, in other words, was the cultural standard.</TE>
<TE>   But we should be long past that attitude. The frequently expressed
thought that jazz is America's true classical music may be overly
rhetorical, but it's not far off target. At the very least, the
recording academy should give serious consideration to expanding the
jazz categories to properly honor the genre's many gifted composers
and arrangers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Numbers: SoundScan reports that record sales were up in 2001 for
jazz releases, as well as for country, soundtracks, Christian/gospel,
New Age and catalog reissues. Sales were down or flat for R&amp;B, rap,
classical, Latin and metal.</TE>
<TE>   Among the genres with rising sales: jazz (19,514,000),
Christian/gospel (49,965,000) and New Age (11,573,000). Among the
genres with flat or decreasing sales: classical (14,846,000), Latin
(20,286,000) and rap (89,279,000).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riffs: The KLON-FM seven-day Mexican Riviera Jazz Cruise scheduled
to embark on May 12 has been canceled, reportedly as the result of
insufficient bookings. ... Among her many other qualities, Princess
Margaret, who died last week, was an enthusiastic jazz fan--so
enthusiastic that Louis Armstrong once described her as "one hip
chick." ... In an exclusive story listing the 22 things "people can
do to stay healthy," radio station KPRC in Houston reports that
"researchers have found that half an hour of jazz or soothing music
can raise the infection-fighting antibodies." Sounds good to me.</TE>

<HD>A Familiar Parable</HD>
<DH>The earnest 'God's Man in Texas' is a comic but uninspired
look at mega-church marketing machines and father-son relationships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the year of our Lord 1985, or thereabouts, American culture
discovered that men of the cloth made for heaven-sent comic fodder.
After all, who needed Gary Hart or Dan Quayle when you had Jim
Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart, Jerry Falwell and, more recently, Jesse
Jackson? Our spiritual leaders' foibles and the Vegas-style excesses
of modern televangelism have supplied satirists with enough material
for a year's worth of Sunday sermons or a dozen "Saturday Night Live"
skits.</LD>
<LD>   Now, slightly behind the curve, comes "God's Man in Texas," local
playwright David Rambo's earnest, good-humored if not exactly
soul-baring account of a generational power struggle at a Houston
mega-church.</LD>
<LD>   Structured around a couple of simple plot lines and filled with
gentle gibes at George Bush (pere and fils), broccoli and other
not-unexpected targets, "God's Man in Texas" offers a mildly
diverting take on high-tech proselytizing and the conflicts inherent
in father-son (and surrogate father-son) relationships.</LD>
<TE>   Sturdily crafted by the playwright and directed in unfussy fashion
by Geffen artistic director Randall Arney, Rambo's piece is more a
serviceable vehicle for familiar ideas about spirituality and its
discontents than a bully pulpit for new, provocative ones. The play
opened Wednesday at the Geffen Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Newfangled ideas have been in short supply for some time at Rock
Baptist Church, the sprawling house of worship-recreation
center-retail emporium over which Dr. Philip Gottschall (George Coe)
presides like an Old Testament Jehovah in pinstripes. Crusty and
cantankerously devout, the octogenarian preacher is so utterly old
school that it's something of a wonder that his church ever made it
into the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Rock Baptist, with its 30,000 parishioners, two swimming
pools, bowling leagues, singles nights and television show, is the
very model of the contemporary corporate-style American church.</TE>
<TE>   Gottschall, its paternalistic CEO, has tended this flock for
decades, and while his board members want to put him out to pasture,
this proud man isn't going anywhere as long his heart keeps ticking
and his TV ratings stay high.</TE>
<TE>   His initially unwitting rival appears in the mild-mannered form of
Dr. Jeremiah "Jerry" Mears (Francis Guinan), a San Antonio minister
whose salesman-preacher father vanished in mysterious circumstances
and whose humdrum exterior cloaks a passionate, eloquent spirit. "You
look bigger on TV. Do you use a lower-than-average pulpit?" drawls
Hugo Taney (Ian Barford), the church's laid-back factotum, when Mears
arrives at Rock Baptist for a stint of guest-preaching. In short
order, Mears finds himself the preferred candidate of the pastor
search committee, which puts him at odds with the resentful,
increasingly imperious Gottschall.</TE>
<TE>   The escalating tension between the two men drives most of the
play's action., and sets up its philosophical debate about how to
build a more intimate connection with the Man Upstairs. Arney's
direction registers these subtle transformations well.</TE>
<TE>   But they might emerge more pointedly if the contest were evenly
matched between the main characters and the two actors. Without
overplaying Mears' naive lapses and flashes of ego and ambition,
Guinan communicates the sincerity and plain-vanilla charm of this
middle-aged preacher answering a higher call. A member of Chicago's
Steppenwolf company, Guinan combines boyish alacrity and
self-effacing integrity to pull off a difficult role.</TE>
<TE>   The same can't quite be said of Coe, whose staccato barks and
lordly glares win laughs but ultimately undercut an already
unsympathetically written character. His venerable age (81)
notwithstanding, Gottschall seems too stuffy and insulated for a wily
Texas good ol' boy managing a multimillion-dollar religious theme
park. Aspects of his role that might humanize him, such as his
telephonic exchanges with his overbearing wife, are too broadly
drawn. Both as penned and as played, he could use a splash of
barbecue sauce on his tie. Or something.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, much of the play's colloquial color derives from the
jocular Hugo, a sleepy-eyed, blunt-spoken veteran of every Rock
Baptist recovery group who wouldn't mind sinning occasionally for old
time's sake. Barford, another Steppenwolf mainstay, has the quality
of a man rode hard and put away wet one too many times, and his
amiable presence is a major plus for the show, despite an
unpersuasive subplot involving yet another estranged father-son
pairing.</TE>
<TE>   "God's Man in Texas" is a modest, inoffensive parable that spends
a few too many verses pounding home well-known themes.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, modern religion's noisy commercialism is a lively subject,
not to mention a tragedy. But as God says to Job in the good book,
sort of, been there, heard that one before.</TE>

<HD>Fairy Tale 'Little Otik' Reveals Its Dark Roots</HD>
<DH>Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer blends live- action and
animation for an insightful commentary on consumer culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the boldly bizarre, darkly funny but poignant "Little Otik"
prodigious Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer once again creates his
unique blend of live-action and animation, this time to spin a
cautionary tale about the dangers of being consumed by one's deepest
desires. It is also a comment on the mindlessness of the consumer
culture and how the routines of middle-class existence rob one's
imagination.</LD>
<LD>   That's a lot of territory for what is essentially an old folk tale
that embodies the myth of Adam and Eve with a touch of Faust, but
Svankmajer has the knack of inviting the viewer to discover
considerable meaning in his work. Indeed, Svankmajer evokes memories
of "The Little Shop of Horrors" and, briefly, even "The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre." As an artist, Svankmajer belongs to a rich
Eastern European tradition in animation and experimental cinema that
views the universe as an absurd mechanism that grinds down the
individual. He has said he views "Little Otik" as revealing the
consequences of those who would rebel against fate and defy the
natural order of life on this planet.</LD>
<TE>   Bozena Horakova (Veronika Zilkova) and Karel Horak (Jan Hartl) are
an ordinary couple who live in a small, old Prague apartment house.
Bozena and Karel, an office worker, have just been told by a doctor
that they are infertile, news that so devastates Bozena that she has
a mental breakdown. Their neighbors, the Stadlers (Jaroslava
Kretschmerova and Pavel Novy), urge them to invest in a vacation
cottage in a forested area, hoping that a change of scenery will lift
Bozena's spirits. While clearing some trees, Karel comes upon a
Mandrake-like root that he fashions into a doll for his depressed
wife, who instantly regards it as the baby she longs for. Karel, who
cares very much what people think, after much wrangling with his
distraught wife, gets her to agree to leave the doll in an armoire
and take it out only on their country sojourns. Yet once back in
town, Bozena's consuming desire to conceive drives her to make a
series of nine pillows, each larger than the last, to simulate
pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in the film, Svankmajer puts the viewer's
willingness to suspend disbelief to a severe test. Though Karel is
cloddish, it's still hard to accept that he would not try to get
professional help for Bozena. Surely, psychotherapy, with the
possibility of adoption to follow, would be worth a try. Yet just as
the feeling that Svankmajer might better have set his film a century
earlier emerges, he revs up the surreal elements of his story, and
"Little Otik" takes off in a wholly captivating manner.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Svankmajer is an acute observer of human nature. If
Bozena has become obsessed and Karel overwhelmed, Mrs. Stadlerova
remains a kindly, concerned neighbor while her husband, although he
regards the Horaks as nice people, is essentially a beer-and-TV boor,
mindlessly strict with his adolescent daughter Atzbetka (Kristina
Adamcova), who turns out to be the film's pivotal figure.</TE>
<TE>   Bright, free-spirited and imaginative, Atzbetka is more aware of
the surrounding goings-on than her elders. Early on she discovers
Bozena's pregnancy is a ruse but tells no one, and when she reads a
folk tale in one of her books she realizes that it seems to be coming
to life in her neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative impact of "Little Otik" is engrossing and
provocative, and Svankmajer draws splendid ensemble performances
across the board, with Adamcova remarkable in her portrayal of an
adolescent caught in the throes of undergoing mind-boggling
experiences she's still too young to comprehend fully.</TE>
<TE>   Svankmajer's use of close-ups of people caught up in daily
activities--such as brushing teeth--is deliberately repellent in
effect, suggesting that those who fail to develop their imaginations
are no more than animals.</TE>
<TE>   "Little Otik" is too outre not to turn off some, but for those who
can go the increasingly macabre distance, its sheer power to confound
can be enthralling.</TE>

<HD>Original 'Peter Pan' Is Flying High in a Remastered Edition</HD>
<DH>Video* To coincide with the release of a Disney sequel, the
1953 version hits stores with its visual wonders refreshed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney synergy is in full bloom this week with the arrival of
the video and DVD of the "Peter Pan Special Edition," timed to the
release of the feature film sequel to the 1953 original, "Peter Pan:
Return to Never Land." The Disney team didn't miss a trick: Specially
marked DVDs and videos include a free movie ticket to "Return to
Never Land." There is also a preview of the new movie on the VHS and
digital editions of "Peter Pan."</LD>
<LD>   Despite the overt commercialism in releasing "Peter Pan" now, the
DVD ($30) is a must for all Disney animation buffs. The Technicolor
production has been beautifully restored and remastered, and the
sound quality is sparkling. The disc includes extras for the kids as
well as parents. Viewers must answer several questions hidden
throughout Never Land in the "Pirate Treasure Hunt Game."</LD>
<LD>   There's also a "Following the Leader" sing-along, plus "Peter's
Playful Prank," a DVD storybook hosted by Wendy and a still-frame
gallery that includes drawings--some used, others not--for this
enchanting adaptation of James M. Barrie's beloved children's story
about the little boy who refuses to grow up.</LD>
<TE>   The documentary "You Can Fly," which is part of both the DVD and
VHS tape, is a fascinating look at the making of "Peter Pan." Film
historian Leonard Maltin, animators Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and
Marc Davis, and Kathryn Beaumont--the voice of Wendy--offer insight
into the production.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney first came upon the idea of making an animated film
based on "Peter Pan" around 1935. Four years later, he acquired the
rights from the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London; Barrie had
given the hospital the rights to his play. Disney then ordered
concept drawings for "Peter Pan," which, as illustrated in the
documentary, offered a far darker rendering of the fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   Production was halted when World War II began. After the war,
Disney and animators resumed plans for the film, and in 1950 it began
in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Driscoll, who had appeared in such popular Disney films as
"Song of the South" and "Treasure Island," was cast as the voice of
Peter. Beaumont, who was also the voice of Alice in "Alice in
Wonderland," came on board as the voice of Wendy. Hans Conreid was
the voice of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Cahn and Sammy Fain, Oliver Wallace, Erdman Penner, Winston
Hibler, Frank Churchill and Jack Lawrence penned the score, which
includes such tunes as "You Can Fly! You Can Fly! You Can Fly!"</TE>
<TE>   Disney's version of "Peter Pan" marked the first time that Peter
was actually played by a boy. In the stage versions and the silent
movie version from the 1920s, a woman played Peter.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary also shows how after the actors recorded their
lines, they "performed" in costume for a movie version of "Peter Pan"
that was made for the animators so they could capture the actors'
expressions and movements.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD also features the 1952 featurette "The Peter Pan Story"
and wonderful commentary from Maltin, Thomas, Johnston, Davis and
Beaumont.</TE>
<TE>   On a sad note, Driscoll's life after "Peter Pan" was tragic. As he
got older, his career went into a tailspin, and he became a heavy
drug user. His body was found in an abandoned Greenwich Village
tenement in 1968. Two children who were playing in the building found
Driscoll, who had even won a juvenile Oscar for 1949's "The Window."</TE>
<TE>   When he was found, however, Driscoll's identity was unknown, and
he was buried in a pauper's grave. A year later, his identity was
revealed through fingerprints.</TE>

<LD>"Cavepainting" is a small exhibition, but it blows through the
galleries of the Santa Monica Museum of Art like a fresh breeze.
There are just nine paintings, three new works by each of three
artists: Scottish-born, Canadian-raised Peter Doig, 42, who has long
lived in London; Chris Ofili, 33, who also works in London; and
L.A.'s Laura Owens, 31. The artists show with the same New York
gallery, and they are said to have undertaken an ongoing dialogue in
the last few years. They also acted as curators of the show, and the
installation is spare and poised. It's a thoroughly satisfying
affair.</LD>
<TE>   What connects the three painters, aside from commercial
affiliation in New York? The answer isn't technique or style. Doig
might be called the most traditional of the three, his large oils
commanding a variety of painterly procedures to conjure mysterious
urban scenes and landscapes. Ofili, by contrast, pushes
two-dimensional surface decoration to a voluptuous extreme, composing
glitter and tiny dots of bright acrylic color into sinuous tendrils
and rhythmic, scalloped patterns, either to create explosive abstract
shapes or decidedly romantic images (a pair of lovers, a nude
odalisque). For her part, Owens smears, stains, stipples, brushes,
collages and daubs, establishing a virtual inventory of mark-making
possibilities on linen; these marks get turned into recognizable
images (plants and animals, especially) or remain abstract.</TE>
<TE>   What these very different works of art do share is an attitude--a
kind of studied crudeness. Coarse, earthy painting is typically
associated with the raw qualities of Expressionism, but the
deliberate, premeditated quality of these pictures works against that
interpretation. Save for the highly personal, idiosyncratic
distortions of color, shape and space in each, there's nothing
remotely Expressionist about them. Instead, a relaxed dreaminess is
pervasive.</TE>
<TE>   Doig's whimsical "Gasthof zur Muldentalsperre" shows two storybook
figures, each dressed in elaborate, old-fashioned military garb, at
the gated entrance to a fortified dam whose heavy masonry
construction is rendered in jewel-like colors. Off in the distance,
beneath a melting sky reminiscent of Edvard Munch, a lone canoe
floats across the dark lake.</TE>
<TE>   Ofili, like a latter-day Henri Rousseau, locates the recumbent
African nude of "Triple Beam Dreamer" in a fanciful, thoroughly
imaginative jungle. She spouts multicolored milk from her breast,
like a celestial figure by Rubens, while the artist's signature balls
of elephant dung are encrusted with acrylic dots in the colors of
rubies, emeralds and onyx, as if they were Faberge eggs.</TE>
<TE>   The repertoire of painted marks in Owens' big, untitled canvas is
twisted into a blissful Edenic landscape of the imagination, where
logic is suspended but wonder prospers. Spider monkeys play with
butterflies, a night owl hoots at the full moon and a gentle bear
pads toward a sunny brook. On a painted field, day and night can
happily coexist.</TE>
<TE>   The studied crudeness of these paintings helps explain the show's
allusive title. The invocation of cave painting reflects a sense of
starting from scratch. Fifteen thousand or 20,000 years ago, before
there were paintings in the caves of Altamira, Spain, or Lascaux,
France, there was no art that we know of.</TE>
<TE>   "Cavepainting" conjures the artist's studio as today's cave, with
the painter working in isolation as secular shaman attempting magic
on the canvas with some colored pigments.</TE>
<TE>   The crudeness in this show's works makes a pointed distinction
between handmade pictures and today's proliferation of high-tech
images, which are inevitably slick. Meanwhile, their carefully
studied quality acknowledges the 30-year reign of Conceptual art,
which eradicated emotive self-expression from the lexicon and is now
at a definitive end.</TE>
<TE>   The best part about the works in this show is that they betray no
sense whatever of painting being some treacherous, beleaguered or
conflicted field. Remember the old moral arguments over "the death of
painting," which was widely asserted three decades ago? In this
exhibition, whether to paint or not simply isn't at issue.</TE>
<TE>   Given the proliferation of painting since the early 1990s, any
claim that painting doesn't matter is pretty old-fashioned--a debate
that might as well be argued in Latin, the academic language of the
priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   "The death of painting," as a viable premise for making new kinds
of art, is long-since dead. Today's more captivating question isn't
whether to paint, but how.</TE>

<HD>Olympics Viewing Flies Off of Ski Jump</HD>
<DH>Television*  Numbers are up 29% compared with the 1998
Games, though viewership still skews toward those over 50.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Concern that the Olympics mean relatively little to younger viewers
who came of age after the Cold War has been in part dispelled by the
current Winter Games, which are scoring across-the-board gains in
various age groups--though they continue to perform
disproportionately well among older viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Buoyed by record-breaking tune-in for last week's opening
ceremony, overall viewing of the Games is up 29% compared with the
first six days of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   While still less than halfway through the Games' 17-day run,
results have exceeded NBC's projections and vaulted the network into
first place for the season. An estimated 32.7 million people in the
U.S. are viewing at any given minute--more than 21/2 times the
network's weekly levels for regular prime-time programming.</LD>
<TE>   That said, the Olympics remain most popular among those over 50.
So far, viewers 50 and older--who represent just under 30% of the
total U.S. audience--account for 45% of those watching the Games,
based on Nielsen Media Research data, about on par with the
percentage from the two previous Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   By way of comparison, NBC's prime-time profile this season,
excluding the Olympics, is slightly younger, with adults over 50
constituting 42% of the network's audience.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, ratings have been less spectacular on non-skating
nights, so much so that NBC initiated what competitors say amounts to
a scheduling trick to manipulate its ratings. Because more viewers
gradually tune in as the night drags on, NBC has begun running its
first half-hour of coverage without commercials so that it can be
omitted from the network's overall average. NBC intends to follow
that pattern on six additional nights.</TE>
<TE>   An NBC spokeswoman said the network did the same during the Summer
Olympics from Sydney, Australia, and that the practice is "completely
legitimate," so long as Nielsen is notified in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Given the Olympics' somewhat older demographic skew, more
youth-oriented programs on competing networks--from Fox's "That '70s
Show" to the WB's "Smallville"--have generally weathered the Olympic
challenge best. ABC and CBS, meanwhile, have in some instances bowed
to the Games by scheduling reruns or movies in place of original
series episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Higher ratings versus the '98 Olympics can be attributed to
various factors, including a renewed patriotism, the fact that the
Games originate on U.S. soil and that portions are being broadcast
live in much of the country, though not on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   NBC has also tailored its coverage to attract a younger audience.
As a result, events such as snowboarding and the freestyle skiing
moguls have received significant attention, contributing to
heightened viewing by adults 18 to 34 and teens, with the network
experiencing 31% and 23% growth, respectively, within those age
brackets.</TE>
<TE>   Such audience breakdowns have implications for the Olympic
movement as well as the Games' appeal to sponsors, since most media
buys are predicated on the number of adults under 50. In general,
advertisers place the most emphasis on reaching young adults, hoping
to establish brand loyalty among consumers who might purchase their
products for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   NBC says that more than 150 million people--or over half of U.S.
residents--have thus far watched at least some of its coverage.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>While Chicago beams over the meteorite success of Bernie Mac, its
hometown comedian-actor ("The Original Kings of Comedy," "Ocean's
Eleven") and sitcom sensation ("The Bernie Mac Show"), I watch on the
screen the tall, beefy and obscenely uproarious man take possession
of the camera with arachnidan eyes and the seductively bullying stage
presence of the man-child I knew 30 years ago as Bernard McCullough.</LD>
<LD>   As I listen to his mishmash of South Side dialect and convoluted
usage, I wonder how much of it is comically purposeful, ironically
fortunate or vindictively calculated as rebellion against my efforts
as his freshman English teacher in 1972 at Chicago Vocational High
School on the Southeast Side. Were it the last, I could hardly blame
him; for Bernie Mac became a success in this world in spite of and,
possibly, because of this first-year teacher's inexperience, naivete
and inability to manage the class in Room 180 in which Bernard
McCullough launched a coup to become "king" of eighth-period English.</LD>
<TE>   Fifteen years old and coming from a poor family with 10 children,
McCullough had a psychologically understandable craving for
individual attention, which he implemented in every way possible in
my classroom of 28 students. Twenty-two years old, I was a recent
college graduate with a teaching degree in English, a white suburban
neophyte with lofty ideals and expectations, and zero experience in
both teaching and classroom control.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard sat in the rear seat of the second row in Room 180 in the
cavernous school's Anthony Wing. Seating was alphabetical, but it
couldn't have worked out better for McCullough, who used the last
position as command center in a constant tug of war between him and
me for the class' attention.</TE>
<TE>   From 2:02 to 2:42 p.m. each afternoon, he kept up a nonstop
barrage of jokes, jibes and extemporaneous replies, loud enough to
crack up the poor pupil in front of him, and often the entire class,
but out of range of my hearing. Someone would laugh, and I'd look up
or turn from the board, but McCullough was always quicker on the
draw, his bug eyes staring back innocently or looking up at the
ceiling in a nonchalance that drew even more guffaws.</TE>
<TE>   As a new instructor, I made the fatal mistake of considering the
chatter and horseplay unworthy of my consideration, so I initially
ignored it. A lot of rookies do the same thing, thinking that peer
pressure and the importance of the learning at hand would eventually
cause the distraction to go away. As all America knows, Bernie Mac
did not go away.</TE>
<TE>   Had I somehow known of his future celebrity, I would have written
down some of the things he said and did for posterity. If a student
came in late, Bernie Mac called attention to his shoes or his pants.
One word would do it--"Floods," he would mumble like a
ventriloquist--and the class would crack up, the student would be
embarrassed, and I'd lose a couple of minutes of instructional time.
If a student were called on for recitation, he or she would
immediately become the object of Mac's scrutiny for the former's
speech, hairstyle or very smell. I would tense and the class would
salivate, if a particularly portly female or a nerdish male would
take the floor. Bernie must have felt our anticipation, for sometimes
he said nothing, just let his clownish stare--an affectation of
shock--explode the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   He was tall and skinny at age 15--a stick version of his current
self--so that physically he was all eyes: taunting, bedeviling,
lightning eyes. It got so that no one even wanted to raise a hand to
volunteer an answer about the sentence's predicate or the meaning of
a literary term. And then my bright idea to put the instigator
himself on the spot would invariably backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, then, let's see what you know about it, Mr. McCullough,"
I'd challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?"</TE>
<TE>   "Your interpretation?"</TE>
<TE>   "Come again, Mr. Teacher, sir? In English, please."</TE>
<TE>   General laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "Quiet, everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Buzzing and commotion.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you remember what 'couplet' means?"</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?"</TE>
<TE>   "Couplet," I said louder, thinking I had the advantage for once.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah. Couplet. That's a little bitty cup, ain't it?"</TE>
<TE>   Bedlam.</TE>
<TE>   I tried changing his seat. Sent a failure notice. Changed his
neighbors' seats. Called his home. Flunked him for the first quarter.
Sent him to the disciplinarian. Kept him after class.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One day, in a department-wide experiment encouraged by our English
chairman, I traded eighth-period classes with another teacher who had
more confidence and facility in dealing with the students. Returning
through the hallway after I had proctored his class, I saw the
teacher zigzagging through hallway traffic to confront me.</TE>
<TE>   "I nearly hauled off on one of your students, McGrath."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry. Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "Tall, dark-skinned guy, sits in the back. He taped a note on the
back of my sports jacket. You better do something with him."</TE>
<TE>   He turned on his heel, handing me the half sheet of notebook paper
with the green ink inscription: Kik me if I is Ugly.</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't actually do anything with Bernie Mac. You could watch
him, glare at him. Or pray he'd get sick. I couldn't quit--I had a
wife with a baby on the way and needed this job. I hoped things would
get better as the year went along. I do know I learned to write on
the board while facing the class.</TE>
<TE>   The only recourse I had was with my grade book. It's not that
Bernie Mac did not do his schoolwork, but his entertainment needs had
priority over writing lesson retention, so his written work suffered
accordingly. I still remember his two- and three-page stories
(voluminous by freshman standards) in his very large and sprawling
orbital script. He'd fill line after line with earnest reportage of
his life and his family, never pausing with a comma or stopping with
a period. He could have earned A's for his papers' content but always
rated an F for the sentence structure and the punctuation. Always an
F for the mechanics--a shortcoming I judged to be a consequence of
his attention deficit (though ADD had yet to be coined), when it
really may have been, instead, a manifestation of his all-consuming
need for unrestrained self-expression. He was bursting back then, and
there was no stopping him.</TE>
<TE>   When he missed class, I was secretly relieved. One or two of the
other male students would try to fill the "inanity" gap, but I dealt
with them quickly and efficiently, since disciplining them was
child's play after contending with McCullough all week. He was gone,
and I'd have a quiet, productive session. I wouldn't even report the
cut to the attendance office, in hopes of encouraging his further
absences.</TE>
<TE>   He missed other classes, too, as multiple FAs (F on account of
absence) in his other classes testified. I put an F in red ink in his
"course book" on grading day and would see with some lukewarm relief
that I wasn't the only one whose life he was making miserable. He
failed nearly everything, to my best recollection, and did not return
to CVS after his first year. I concluded that he must have turned 16
and dropped out entirely, for I never saw him again. Never heard from
him again, until I ran into a teaching colleague last year.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think of Bernie McCullough now?"</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "Bernie Mac. You know who he is, don't you?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since the revelation, I've watched his breakout film, "The Kings
of Comedy," and have seen highlights of his TV show. I observe the
talent, the energy, the ambition, the almost desperate need for
undivided attention. I listen to his fractured usage and
pronunciation, watch him imitate the strut of Phil Jackson, coach of
the Lakers. And then I hear his anger, affected, of course, or
supposedly so, in his disparagement of the New Age hands-off
parenting practices.</TE>
<TE>   And I turn him off because I am ashamed. Not of him or his show.
He is tremendous. With his onstage rhythmic deprecations, cathartic
tirades and astute impressions, he is an artist who has thrived in
spite of me. I'm ashamed because I failed him. Not by giving him an
F, but by not knowing or soon enough learning how to nurture his
gifts. I think how if he had come to my class when I had three or
four years of experience, I could have channeled his force into
wonderful avenues of creativity and leadership. And then I think how
maybe I did after all--channeled it straight out of the classroom,
out of the school, out of the establishment, putting it on the stage
where not 28, but 28 million can be led to laugh at themselves and
forget the reality for a while.</TE>

fill more than 70 vacant jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The institution, which operates 16 museums and research centers,

<TE>   Judge: Robbie Williams Owes Woody Guthrie</TE>
<TE>   Singer Robbie Williams and his publisher must pay $71,000 in
royalties to the owners of a song whose lyrics he plagiarized, a
London judge ruled Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Nicholas Pumfrey rejected a request for more damages from
Ludlow Music Inc., which holds the copyright to the 1961 Woody
Guthrie song "I Am the Way."</TE>
<TE>   The High Court ruled in October 2000 that Williams had copied
substantial portions of the song for "Jesus in a Camper Van," a track
from his 1998 album "I've Been Expecting You."</TE>
<TE>   Williams and his collaborators admitted using elements of a
version of the song that Loudon Wainwright III had adapted in 1973
and credited him on the album. But he and publisher EMI had not
agreed to Ludlow's request for 50% of the song royalties. EMI had
offered 25% instead. Ludlow fought the offer in court. Pumfrey ruled
Williams should pay 25% of the royalties--about $71,000--along with
some of Ludlow's costs.</TE>

tax-exempt bonds that it will sell to make the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Studio 54 would then become Roundabout's permanent home for

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chiho Aoshima's solo debut begins with "Paradise," a poster-size
digital print that depicts seven winsome teens lolling away a
picture-perfect afternoon on a verdant island adrift in a dazzling
aqua sky. Napping under trees, dipping toes in crystalline waters,
petting a fawn, cuddling one another and fiddling with their
hairstyles, the dark-haired nudes appear to be leading lives of
absolute contentment, not a worry in the world to put a wrinkle on
their pretty faces.</LD>
<LD>   That, at least, is how it looks to a viewer standing in the foyer
of Blum &amp; Poe Gallery. To anyone who lives in the real world of adult
responsibilities, such sugarcoated visions are dime-a-dozen
daydreams.</LD>
<LD>   But when you look closely, you notice that none of the girls seems
to be happy. On the whole, they appear to be going through the
motions, acting out someone else's fantasies as if they were robots
or clones with no will of their own. The notion that trouble's
brewing in paradise--and that there's more to Aoshima's girls than
meets the eye--is driven home in the main gallery, where four
similarly printed images paint a picture of teen life that's anything
but idyllic.</LD>
<TE>   "Chinese Noodles Girl" shows the aftermath of a bicycle accident
in an ancient graveyard, a bowl of ramen spilling over the head of a
hapless delivery girl. She signals her distress by holding the back
of her wrist to her forehead, like a heroine from a classic movie.</TE>
<TE>   The visions that unfold in these works seem to belong to the teens
they portray. In "Mushroom Room," a nude girl lies on her bed and
stares at the ceiling as an abundance of the polka-dotted fungus
sprouts all around her. Whether poisonous or hallucinatory, their
upright forms are distinctly phallic.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Red-Eyed Tribe," a nearly 12-foot-long panorama, the
Tokyo-based artist presents a band of stylish goddesses who preside
over a seaside Eden, where mountains descend from the heavens, fish
swim through the sky and giant crystals hover overhead, like alien
spacecraft. In Aoshima's girl-world, nymphets ride centipedes, and
Gila monsters as initiates mix magic potions and acolytes pick plump
cherries from a tree's serpentine limbs.</TE>
<TE>   The newest print is also the most chilling. Blood flows freely in
"The Birth of a Giant Zombie," which features a lithe blond with an
ax stuck in her head. Lilliputian mummies, cute vampires and
ravishing skeletons populate this perverse land, which would be
horrifying if not for Aoshima's delicate touch. A pastel-tinted
sunset and loads of spring blossoms transform the Gothic nightmare
into a reverie at once lovely and melancholic.</TE>
<TE>   Utterly artificial and stunningly seductive, her exquisitely
rendered cartoons give vivid form to the topsy-turvy world in which
we live, where repressed fantasies do a lot more damage than those
that see the light of day. In the not-too-distant future, Aoshima
will likely be thought of as a Realist.</TE>

<TE>   A Touch of Classicism, Mixed With Romanticism</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Classicism, Romanticism lives on today as the rebellious
avant-garde desire to break away from historical precedents. At China
Art Objects Galleries, Edgar Bryan's solo debut consists of four
terrific oils-on-canvas (and two more in the office upstairs) that
combine Classicism's desire to be inspired by another age with
Romanticism's fantasy of breaking free of such influences.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the young artist's beautifully painted pictures are
weird. Not a trace of Postmodern irony can be found in them. Nor can
a whiff of mockery or sarcasm. Nevertheless, you'd be hard-pressed to
say they're sincere. Their pleasures are direct but hardly
straightforward.</TE>
<TE>   One nearly life-size image depicts a husky bearded guy who,
wearing an apron and disposable plastic gloves, stands behind a table
and cuts a hunk of red meat. Although everything in the painting
screams "Butcher," you can't help but think that that's not what it's
about. Bryan has done nothing to disguise the fact that he worked
from a studio setup. The blank background and paucity of props
suggest that he's after something more elusive than a portrait of an
old-fashioned tradesman.</TE>
<TE>   A plate of fat sausages and an empty beer bottle star in the
show's largest painting. In its blurry background, a silhouetted
woman raises her arms, as if practicing a dance. But the biggest
mystery resides in the foreground, where it's impossible to tell if
the sausages are accompanied by chunks of potatoes or apples or Gouda
cheese. Bryan is too talented a painter to leave such things to
chance, so his unidentifiable food objects leave you wondering.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining two paintings steal the show. In one, a homeless man
plays pool with a dignified character who looks as if he'd be equally
at home in an Italian fashion magazine or any 17th century Northern
European painting of the rising bourgeoisie. The other portrays a
red-eyed student who looks as if he hasn't slept in a week. Clutching
a sheet of paper on which is typed an absurd story about a purloined
potato, the young man sits at a table, contemplating the spud.</TE>
<TE>   If Bryan didn't paint with such jaw-dropping facility and prickly
verve, it might be possible to think of his works as precocious
pranks, clever evocations of elements from Manet, Chardin, Caravaggio
and Zurbaran, as well as from Gerhard Richter, John Curran and Kurt
Kauper.</TE>
<TE>   Although much is still unresolved in Bryan's promising paintings,
they are going somewhere you won't want to miss.</TE>

<TE>   A Flight Plan That Strays Into Mundaneness</TE>
<TE>   Soo Kim's large color photographs pay a visit to the world of
international travel, depicting flying jets, seated passengers and
people waiting to meet them at the gate. Unfortunately, the young
artist's images bring very little that is original to the common
experience of air travel. At Sandroni-Rey Gallery, Kim's 11 C-prints
fall into three groups. The first consists of five images of the
undersides of planes as they approach or depart from LAX. Tightly
cropped so that their noses, tails and wings form abstract
compositions, these pictures emphasize the vulnerability of the
aircraft, their plump bellies streaked by oil leaks and marred by
everyday wear and tear.</TE>
<TE>   Three images Kim shot from her seat on trips to London, Copenhagen
and Seoul are more touching. Each shows the back of the seat
immediately in front of hers, around the side of which appears
another passenger's shoulder or a few strands of hair. Whether taken
on planes or transit buses, each captures the soft light that enters
through the vehicle's window and the ghostly reflections that appear
there.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the final three pieces depicts a person standing in a
crowd at LAX's international terminal, holding a sign like those
limousine drivers use to locate the travelers they've been sent to
pick up. But the people in Kim's pictures do not work for car
services. They are friends she has asked to pose with signs bearing
the names of people they'd like to meet.</TE>
<TE>   The man waiting for Raymond Carver looks as if he has given up but
continues to stick around because he doesn't know what else to do.
The woman pretending she was sent to greet Yoko Ono appears to be at
the point where frustration boils over into anger. And the guy
looking for Chico Buarque brings a child's eagerness to his task.
Undaunted by its long odds, he seems to be inspired by the knowledge
that stranger things have happened.</TE>
<TE>   All of Kim's handsomely printed photographs are accessible and
more or less charming. But they fail to take viewers beyond the
obvious, borrowing styles and formats from too many other artists. In
a sense, Kim treats the phenomenon of international travel as if she
were a tourist, merely scratching the surface of subjects that merit
closer scrutiny and deeper, more insightful treatment.</TE>

<TE>   Computer Tools Added to the Artist's Palette</TE>
<TE>   At Art Center College of Design's Williamson Gallery, an
instructive exhibition presents works by eight artists who use
advanced computer technology as if it were just another tool, like a
paintbrush, pencil or chisel. Titled "GHz: The Post-Analog Object in
L.A.," the thought-provoking show features a wide variety of objects.
(The title stands for gigahertz, a unit of frequency.) These include
ceramic teapots, monochrome paintings, wooden benches, a sound
installation, fiberglass sculptures, ink-jet prints and bracelets
made of pearls, plastic and sapphires.</TE>
<TE>   Co-curators Stephen Nowlin, the gallery director, and John
O'Brien, an artist and writer, have selected pieces whose reliance on
high-tech devices and up-to-the-minute software is not immediately
evident. Unlike an earlier crop of artists, whose infatuation with
newfangled technology often overwhelmed what they did with it, this
group uses computers as a means to an end.</TE>
<TE>   Their works represent the next phase in the integration of
technology, design and creativity. How an artist made something is
never as compelling as how it makes you respond, and the best works
in "GHz" deliver on the latter while arousing curiosity about the
former.</TE>
<TE>   These include Patricia Moisan's finely patterned paintings on
undulating sheets of acrylic; Cindy Kolodziejski's vessels with
distorted images painted on their curved surfaces; George Stone's
20-part sound system energized by solar cells; and Sue Dorman's odd
jewelry, which combines gold, silver, precious gems and Carborundum
in asymmetrical settings.</TE>
<TE>   Four Iris prints by Linda Nishio resemble extremely refined
versions of drawings kids made in the 1960s with Spirograph kits. The
sense of motion they capture is lost in her aluminum sculptures,
which appear to be industrial-strength tops that have stopped
spinning. Likewise, floor and wall works by Wendy Adest, David
Schafer and Jason Pilarski are too static and antiseptic to repay the
time spent with them.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the diversity of the works, a sense of homogeneity
pervades. Color plays a minor role, with a dull palette of whites,
grays and silvers predominating. Likewise, the largest objects (by
Nishio, Adest, Schafer and Pilarski) are so sleek, polished and
clinical that they do not elicit the desire to touch them--or even to
imagine what that might feel like. Although computers are changing
the way art is made, they have a long way to go to catch up with many
of its simpler, tried-and-true tools.</TE>

<HD>Rarely Seen Goya Prints Reveal Work of a Master</HD>
<DH>Art* Two of the Spanish artist's early series had
wide-ranging influence on the graphic arts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN PARROTT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The gore, sportsmanship and pure daring of bullfighting is captured
in fine detail in Francisco de Goya's early 19th century etchings.
But the black-and-white prints seem even more vivid displayed against
a wall of crimson red, curved like a bullring and stained like the
blood of a thousand matadors.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in four decades, the Meadows Museum at Southern
Methodist University is exhibiting the Spanish master's print series,
"La Tauromaquia," along with "Los Disparates," a series of
disturbing, dreamlike images painted in Goya's later years.</LD>
<LD>   Both first-edition series, part of the museum's permanent
collection, were believed etched between 1814 and 1824, when Goya was
perfecting his mastery of engraving copper printing plates.</LD>
<TE>   "He's the first great printmaker in the history of Spain," said
curator Mark Roglan, who previously was a researcher at the Prado
Museum in Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   Goya is often considered the father of modern art, and his works
mark the beginning of 19th century realism, Roglan said.</TE>
<TE>   His etching skills became so refined that he eventually composed
directly on the copper plates without need of preparatory drawings.
The techniques were a "revolution that changed the direction of
graphic art and as a great force that linked art to modernity,"
Roglan said.</TE>
<TE>   "La Tauromaquia," translated as "The Art of Bullfighting," depicts
the evolution of the bloody sport, including the time of Arab rule of
Spain in the 8th through 15th centuries. The 33 prints also feature
bullfighters of Goya's time, many of whom were his friends and
members of royalty.</TE>
<TE>   Offered in public art galleries, the prints never became a huge
commercial success. They also were not always historically accurate.
Clothing, architecture and portraits of historical figures sometimes
conflict with the period represented.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Stepanek, a print expert at the Museum of Fine Art in
Boston, said she believes the bullfighting scenes were an endorsement
of the sport, not a commentary on its violent nature.</TE>
<TE>   "He intended to show the history and human ability to be a master
of the sport," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Disparates" is more difficult to interpret. The name has no
direct translation but alludes to the absurd and irrational. It was
Goya's last major print series, designed when he was deaf and
believed to be living a lonely, solitary life on the outskirts of
Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   He spent his last years retreating into a world of fantasy and
darkness, Roglan said. The 22 prints are filled with images of fear,
violence and sorrow: a faceless figure shrouded in a robe being
swallowed by a monster, a man falling into an abyss, men flying with
artificial wings.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Disparates'" engravings were not made into prints until 1864,
36 years after his death.</TE>
<TE>   "They were exclusively done for himself," Roglan said. "They were
very intimate. We do not know exactly what these things meant. Some
say the only way to understand his prints is through psychoanalysis."</TE>
<TE>   Stepanek said some scholars believe the prints are based on the
biblical book of Proverbs, although Goya never documented that
notion. "They are very enigmatic," she said. "It's very unusual,
bizarre behavior. He definitely had ideas about society or political
events."</TE>
<TE>   The Meadows Museum, which houses one of the largest collections of
Spanish art outside of Spain, also owns first editions of Goya's two
other major print series, "The Caprices" and "The Disasters of War,"
both of which have been displayed in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "La Tauromaquia" and "Los Disparates" were not displayed for many
years because the works are lesser known and not as easily understood
by museum patrons, Roglan said. Also, the museum reopened last year
in a new facility with six times the exhibition space of the previous
campus location, where much of the permanent collection had to be
stored.</TE>
<TE>   The four sets of prints were acquired by Algur Meadows and his
wife in April 1967, two years after the opening of the Meadows
Museum. The Meadowses later bought four late-edition prints to
complete the set of all known prints connected with "Los Disparates,"
along with two more late prints closely related to "La Tauromaquia."
The prints were purchased for the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Goya, born in Fuendetodos in 1746, established his reputation by
painting frescoes for a basilica in Saragossa, Spain. He later worked
at a tapestry factory. He also began to paint portraits and became
court painter to Charles IV in 1789.</TE>
<TE>   He lived through the turbulence and atrocities of the war of
independence against invading France, which led to his war disasters
series. His most innovative works were created after a near-fatal
illness left him deaf at the age of 47.</TE>
<TE>   The print series, which opened Jan. 27, runs at the Meadows
through April 1.</TE>

<LD>As we've lately come to realize, it's harder to look up to the skies
and dream beautiful dreams when those same skies are capable of
delivering man-made destruction. So one can understand the
no-nonsense skepticism chilling the fantasy life of Jane, a gritty
young girl struggling to keep watch over her little brother, Danny,
while making her way through London streets bruised by bombs during
World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Her father's away fighting the good fight while her mother ...
well, as far as Jane is concerned, her mother, Wendy, is being just
... so  ... ridiculous, filling little Danny's head with these
stories of Never Land, that improbably glorious island past some
silly star in the sky. And Mother just won't shut up about her
adventures with brash, silly Peter Pan and his pixie pal Tinker Bell
and his Lost Boys and pirate ships! The idea! Doesn't Mother know
there's a war on? Who has time for such treacle?</LD>
<LD>   The same question may well occur to grown-ups settling in with
their kids to watch "Return to Never Land," the latest manifestation
of Walt Disney Studios' curious impulse to update its classic
animated features. What's left? "Raging Thumper"? "Toothpicks! The
Cloning of Pinocchio"? The best such projects will ever be is nice.
And some have barely reached even that.</LD>
<TE>   So it's no use expecting "Return to Never Land" to match, much
less exceed, Disney's 1953 version of "Peter Pan," which by itself
isn't quite in the uppermost tier of the studio's full-length
cartoons. (Or maybe it is, depending on which one you first saw as a
child.) Still, director Robin Budd's video-friendly approach, while
falling short of magic, gets by on a chipper bumptiousness that may
be just enough to pull the movie into the audience's good graces.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, you probably don't need to be told that Jane's spoilsport
temperament has no chance against Captain Hook and his pirates, who,
believing her to be Wendy, spirit her away to Never Land to blackmail
Peter Pan into surrender. You also don't need to be told that Peter
outwits Hook and uses his charm and the Lost Boys' roughhouse antics
to lower Jane's stiff upper lip. And Tinker Bell, petulant and
fetching as ever, still wants no other girls around but her.</TE>
<TE>   The voices are all competent and frisky, especially Harriet Owen's
Wendy and Corey Burton's Hook, who's so redolent of the late,
irreplaceable Hans Conried that you'd swear he'd been thawed for the
occasion.</TE>

<HD>Cash Scheme Makes for a Comic 'Common Man'</HD>

<LD>The hard-luck guys in Matthew Klein's new comedy "The Common Man"
need cash and a reason to get out of bed each morning. Success on
these fronts might give them something they need still more:
self-respect.</LD>
<LD>   So when a moneymaking scheme comes along, they sign on, even
though it means doing a little job for the mob. The resulting mayhem
leaves them holding the bag--two, actually, both full of rotting
parrot carcasses--in a funny, frenetic staging at the Met Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The nervous hypochondriac Leonard (Carl J. Johnson) is a would-be
screenwriter who's rooming temporarily with his buddy Peter (Gregory
Littman), a towering, tough-looking guy who dreams, improbably, of
becoming a Sinatra-like crooner. They share a shabby apartment in
present-day Brooklyn that designer Bo Crowell has envisioned as a
place where no two pieces of furniture match and a can of Raid stands
ready atop the refrigerator.</LD>
<TE>   The roommates are at wit's end when their none-too-trustworthy
acquaintance Japs (playwright Klein) bursts in, talking a mile a
minute about how he's found the half-million dollars to finance a
business proposition for all of them. But first, they must deal with
the parrots, a mob baby-sitter (Art LaFleur, wonderfully placid yet
lethal) and Japs' doofus brother, Stanley (Kevin Brief).</TE>
<TE>   The stress frequently launches someone at someone else's throat in
the propulsive staging by Stuart K. Robinson (best known for
directing very different material: Charlayne Woodard's "Pretty
Fire"). The action takes an unfortunate turn toward dopey
psychological drama in the second act, but until then, it's "The
Sopranos" crossed with "WWF Smackdown," "Fear Factor" and a bit of "I
Love Lucy."</TE>

<TE>   A Perfunctory Mystery in Christie's 'The Hollow'</TE>
<TE>   As Agatha Christie mysteries go, "The Hollow" is a prototypical
specimen, serving up all the requisite whodunit ingredients: a remote
English country manor, a menagerie of suspects with an abundance of
motives, clues and red herrings, and, of course, a murder.</TE>
<TE>   Dame Agatha had a knack for making homicide a tidy business, and a
by-the-book staging by Jon Berry for the Woodland Hills Theatre keeps
even the onstage incidents of foul play within polite boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the victim (Tom Hyer) is a thoroughly reprehensible cad
who comfortably deserves his fate, and after the obligatory plot
twists things get neatly wrapped up with minimal burden to the
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   In adapting her 1946 novel for the stage, Christie seemed
determined to strip away any distinguishing marks. Most
significantly, she replaced her popular hero, the eccentric Hercule
Poirot, with an entirely generic Inspector Colquhoun (a non-comedic
Dudley Moore-ish presence played by Frank Collins), who remains
doggedly one step behind events.</TE>
<TE>   Other than an impressively elaborate garden-room set by Victoria
Profitt, what most distinguishes this production is the size of its
cast, 13, which handily serves the company's community objectives. Go
if you know someone in it, but be aware that performances remain
pretty consistently at a community theater level, with Collins, Greg
Ungar, Amanda Bauman and Veronica Krestow the noteworthy exceptions.
Accents are all over the map--few, alas, in the vicinity of England.</TE>

<HD>Mean-Spirited Cops Via the Broken Lizard Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing super about "Super Troopers" except for those deep
into the low end of the frat-house mentality that equates
smart-alecky with hilarity. Since that exception could just prove to
be pretty sizable at the box office, it's scary to ponder that just
when it looked like the "Police Academy" franchise was dead and
buried, a bunch of goonish Vermont law enforcement officers might
rise up to take their place. At least the first couple of "Police
Academy" pictures were as funny as they were good-natured.</LD>
<LD>   "Good-natured" is a phrase that does not apply to "Super
Troopers." The five-man comedy group Broken Lizard plays state
troopers stationed along a highway running through a small Vermont
town who are engaged in a turf war with the local cops that escalates
in the course of the film. There's a lot at stake for the troopers,
whose station is vulnerable to elimination via cost-cutting.</LD>
<TE>   The local boys in blue are just as oafish as the troopers, and
neither side will stop at anything to make their rivals look bad. In
the meantime, the troopers are a menace to all who cross their paths.
There's a nastiness in their nonstop pranks that derives from the
fact they are empowered by their uniforms and weapons. The worst of
the lot is a seriously overweight maniac named Farva (Kevin
Heffernan). Never mind that one instance of his brutality is caught
on a surveillance tape, for all Farva gets is a slap on the wrist by
his commanding officer (Brian Cox, a brilliant actor in unfortunate
circumstances).</TE>
<TE>   When a corpse and load of marijuana pop up, the troopers see their
big chance to prove their worth and save their jobs--if they can beat
the cops in solving the case.</TE>
<TE>   The film's only mildly amusing moments are provided by people
other than members of Broken Lizard. Andre Vippolis, Joey Kern and
Geoffrey Arend are a trio of amiable zanies as stoned fraternity boys
who have the misfortune of being stopped by Trooper Thorny (Jay
Chandrasekhar, who also directed).</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Brenninkmeyer and Maria Tornberg supply some extravagant
European decadence as a wildly uninhibited German couple. Still
looking like Wonder Woman, Lynda Carter cameos as Vermont's governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Super Troopers" is being released through Fox Searchlight, 20th
Century Fox's "classics" division, possibly because the studio hopes
it has another male bonding comedy hit on its hands like "The Full
Monty," but "Super Troopers" comes up empty.</TE>

<HD>The Fruits of an Endemic Tradition</HD>
<DH>Germany's WDR Symphony is a fine example of why radio
matters in Europe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>When Internet radio finally catches on, when we can easily tune into
high-quality broadcasts from anywhere in the world, Americans will
have cause to be astonished. A number of the great national radio
networks in Europe and Asia support major symphony orchestras (as NBC
and CBS did in our own dim past). In addition, they support symphonic
music as a living art form, persistently programming and
commissioning important new work for broadcast.</LD>
<LD>   The best known radio orchestra is the BBC Symphony in London, but
there are many others, including those of Radio Netherlands and Radio
France. In Germany, radio orchestras are an essential part of the
musical landscape.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the WDR Symphony of Cologne (WDR are the call letters
for Westdeutscher Rundfunk, the nationally supported radio network of
the former West Germany), began its first American tour in Southern
California. Following concerts in Palm Desert (Tuesday), San Diego
(Wednesday) and Palm Springs (Thursday), the orchestra travels the
country for the rest of the month.</LD>
<TE>   That the tour skipped Los Angeles (UCLA and the Music Center
weren't interested) and the Orange County Performing Arts Center
(which didn't have a free hall) is unfortunate. Civic Theatre in San
Diego was not the best venue in which to hear the Cologne players. It
is bone dry; the sound practically crackles as if blown across the
stage by an acoustical Santa Ana wind. But the sound is at least
true, clearly displaying this crisp band from its highest to lowest
frequencies.</TE>
<TE>   And the WDR Symphony happens to be a very crisp orchestra, as some
record collectors might recall from its recordings (under the name
Cologne Radio Symphony) of the nine Bruckner Symphonies conducted by
Gunther Wand in the late '70s and early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian conductor, Semyon Bychkov, now in his fifth season as
music director of the WDR Symphony, has maintained the orchestra's
sharply etched sound. He has also continued its imaginative
programming.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's concert began with "Feria," a resplendent recent work
by Magnus Lindberg that couldn't have better celebrated the communal
role of radio in European contemporary music. It was commissioned by
the Finnish broadcasting system and premiered by the Finnish Radio
Symphony at BBC-sponsored Proms in London in 1997, and, of course,
broadcast live throughout Britain and in much of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Meant to evoke an outdoor Spanish festival, "Feria" is a great
whirling exercise for large orchestra. The score, which lasted about
17 minutes in Bychkov's performance (it was faster at its premiere),
teams with life. Every instrument is an individual but easily falls
in step with others. A snappy trumpet tune whirls throughout the
beginning, picking up movement and momentum from its collisions with
other instruments, almost like subatomic particles bouncing around in
space banging into each other, forming new elements or setting off
explosions of matter.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly what comes from these collisions is something new, but not
always. In the middle, the brass suddenly coalesces into a quote from
a Monteverdi madrigal, a fleeting, ghostly image of the past, soon to
be washed away by a watery Debussyan duet for piano and flute before
the festivities erupt again throughout the whole orchestra. The
overall effect is one of sustained brilliance, and that is just how
it was played.</TE>
<TE>   Mendelssohn's Concerto in E Major for two pianos offered a
different kind of brilliance. It was written when the composer was 14
and already a dazzling talent. With Katia and Marielle Labeque as the
lively soloists, the rarely heard concerto revealed a composer
certainly far from fully formed but with enough technique to make his
adolescent enthusiasm come irresistibly alive. It is music to make a
listener of any age feel young. And the French sisters delighted in
the opportunities for sparkling pianism, while the orchestra
participated with light and agile accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   For Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, which concluded the program,
Bychkov continued the mood of celebration and youth. The orchestra
was large, but the playing was fleet, full of color and finely
textured, in the way a chamber performance might be.</TE>
<TE>   Bychkov's Beethoven was not so much a heroic barnstormer as a
composer who, in every measure, had something surprising to show. It
was, as was the evening, a show of dazzling music.</TE>

<HD>In 'John Q.,' Mistrust, Frenzy Are Part of the Prescription</HD>
<DH>In a rabble-rousing film, the formidable Denzel Washington
plays a father in desperate search of care for his ailing son.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"John Q." is an all-stops-out rabble-rouser that hurls a broadside at
America's medical insurance crisis. It takes aim at the HMO hell that
so many Americans have experienced firsthand and drives home its
message with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.</LD>
<LD>   Yet all the while, it is building tension powerfully because at
every turn it has the courage of its material and because it also
reveals what it means to be a father and a husband in the fullest,
most uncompromising sense of the words.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't hurt that the husband and father in question is played
by Denzel Washington, fresh off his "Training Day" change-of-pace
triumph and very much at the top of his considerable form.</LD>
<TE>   Soon after the picture opens, a tow truck is hauling away a car
from a neat, modest home in a suburban Chicago blue-collar
neighborhood. Washington's John Quincy Archibauld is a factory worker
who has been cut back to 20 hours a week.</TE>
<TE>   Even though his wife, Denise (Kimberly Elise), has recently taken
a grocery store job, he is having a real struggle making ends meet,
unable to land a second job, as hard as he tries.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the strain, the Archibaulds are a solid family, and John
draws moral support from his co-workers, who are in the same boat,
especially from his loyal best friend Jimmy Palumbo (David Thornton)
and his wife, Gina ("Mulholland Drive's" Laura Harring). John and
Denise are devoted to their only child, grade-schooler Michael
(Daniel E. Smith). One Sunday, after church, as his parents are
cheering him on from the bleachers, Michael suddenly collapses while
playing baseball and is rushed to one of Chicago's finest hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Turner (James Woods), a top-notch but resolutely detached
cardiologist, saves Michael's life--for now. As it turns out,
Michael's heart is three times the size it should be, a condition
that might well have gone undetected because HMO doctors overlooked
it or refrained from revealing it.</TE>
<TE>   Relieved that at least he has major medical coverage, John gets
another shock: His employer, having reduced him from full-time to
part-time status, has downgraded his insurance. Michael, therefore,
has no coverage whatsoever, and the hospital's ice-cold administrator
(Anne Heche) informs John and Denise that the heart transplant needed
to save their son's life will cost $250,000 and that they will have
to come up with $75,000 as down payment for her to put Michael on the
donor list. At this moment the Archibaulds have just $1,000 in the
bank. (In one of those awful coincidences that plague movies now and
then, there is a TV clip of director Ted Demme, who died of heart
failure several weeks ago; it is surprising that New Line hasn't
excised it as a matter of taste.)</TE>
<TE>   Director Nick Cassavetes and writer James Kearns, aided strongly
by legendary editor Dede Allen, know exactly how to shape their story
into a dramatic form that allows a raft of first-rate actors,
including Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, Eddie Griffin and Shawn Hatosy,
to express it vividly. They balance protest with an equal concern for
revealing John's character under extreme pressure, making bold use of
foreshadowing, satire and suspense.</TE>
<TE>   They also reveal the terrible vulnerability of America's working-
and middle-class families in today's economy and, in doing so, make
an important point, self-evident upon reflection but rarely if ever
made in a movie: that it is no longer safe for ordinary people to
pursue ordinary dreams and trust that our systems work.</TE>
<TE>   "John Q." is unafraid to speak the plain truth: Money matters.
Indeed, Kearns was inspired to write the script for "John Q.," which
took nearly eight years to come to fruition, when he read a newspaper
account of a heart transplant recipient who remarked. "If I wasn't
rich, I'd be dead by now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA-rated: PG-13, for violence, language and intense thematic
elements. Times guidelines: The film is too intense for small
children.</TE>

<HD>Telling a POW's Tale</HD>
<DH>Movies* John Katzenbach's novel, 'Hart's War,' was loosely
about his father's WWII experiences; the film is yet another step
away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALINA TUGEND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As Nicholas Katzenbach walked onto the film set of "Hart's War," the
memories of his prisoner-of-war days during World War II were brought
back full force.</LD>
<LD>   "It was as realistic, as accurate as it could be," says
Katzenbach, 80, whose son John wrote the novel on which the MGM film,
which opens today, is based. "It gave me a chill."</LD>
<LD>   John, 51, recalls his father stepping out of a taxi in Milovice,
the small Czech town where much of the film was shot and seeing the
replica of the guard tower. "He said to me, 'I never thought I'd see
that again,' said John, who doesn't remember his father,
Nicholas--attorney general under President Lyndon Johnson--talking
much about his 27 months as a POW in Germany.</LD>
<TE>   There weren't many stories about his being shot down in the
Mediterranean in February 1943 on his 20th bombing mission, about
being plucked out of the ocean by the Italians, being given
starvation rations or being jammed into boxcars so full only half the
men could sit at a time. But John Katzenbach is a former journalist
and a mystery writer, and ultimately his father's history became
fodder for a novel.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, both father and son stressed that the book
is a novel and only loosely based on Nicholas' experiences. And as is
almost always the case, the film itself is one step removed from the
book. For example, in the book, Tommy, like young Nicholas
Katzenbach, is a navigator who is shot down. Like Nicholas, he is a
young Ivy Leaguer. Like Nicholas, he was shoeless upon capture. But
the similarity pretty much ends there.</TE>
<TE>   "We departed quite a bit from the novel and at times John wasn't
quite sure, but at the end of the day, we didn't depart from the
integrity," says the film's producer, David Ladd.</TE>
<TE>   John Katzenbach agrees. "A lot of novelists sit around and whine
about what Hollywood does to their books, but movies are not books. I
wanted them to find the core of what was in the book and turn it into
a terrific movie--to create something that would stand on its own two
feet."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that the movie is being marketed as a Bruce
Willis action shoot-'em-up--to the dismay of director Gregory Hoblit,
who calls it a "disservice" to the real POWs--the crux of the film is
about two black aviators who are shot down and join the all-white POW
camp. The fliers--Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Howard) and Lt. Lamar
Archer (Vicellous Shannon)--ignite seething racism in some of the
enlisted men, leading to a murder and a court-martial within the POW
camp. Colin Farrell, the young Irish actor known best for his work in
the Vietnam-era movie "Tigerland", plays Tommy Hart, a fresh-faced
lieutenant who represents defendant Scott, while Willis stars as
tough and embittered Col. William McNamara, the highest-ranking
American officer in the camp.</TE>
<TE>   None of that happened at Katzenbach's POW camp. Some black
aviators were shot down and joined his camp, but, Katzenbach says,
the POW commanding officer was from South Carolina "and he was
absolutely determined there would be no racial discrimination that
the Germans could use for propaganda. He put the first black officer
in with nine men from below the Mason-Dixon Line and said, 'If there
are any problems, there will be a court-martial when we get back.'"</TE>
<TE>   Even if the racist incidents were not part of Nicholas' POW
experience, John says his interest in such issues stems directly from
his father's role in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations during
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "Every good idea he inherited from me," his father jokes. With a
sidelong look at this father, John pretends to ignore him, but agrees
that "I tend to write novels that have race or age at the core. Tommy
Hart went to war, but his real war was against racism."</TE>
<TE>   For producer-director Hoblit ("Primal Fear," "Frequency") one of
his key goals was to accurately portray the soldiers' daily lives.
During his research for the movie, "it became clear to me, I was not
only dealing with the greatest generation, but with a passing
generation. Soon there won't be anyone to tell the first-person
story.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it was imperative to get everything right. I wanted
veterans who were watching it to think we got it right.... If we did
that, I'll be a long way toward being a happy person."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Katzenbach says the movie successfully reflects some of
the monotony of being a prisoner of war. "Sitting in camp, the
primary thing is you're bored to death," he says. In fact, Nicholas,
who had interrupted his undergraduate education at Princeton to join
the war, managed to graduate with his class by reading the textbooks
for his junior and senior years in the camp. The books were sent by
the YMCA, "and every once in awhile the Germans would slip in a 'Mein
Kampf' in English," recalls Nicholas, who lives in Princeton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Katzenbach, who lives in Amherst, Mass., says that was
the main message he got as a child about his father's POW days--"that
there's an opportunity in every situation, no matter how harsh."</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say that the elder Katzenbach's time as a POW was
without drama. He recalls that while being transported by train after
their capture, as in the movie, American fliers accidentally began
bombing the POW trains. The boxcars flew open and "we got out and we
started walking in our uniforms," he says. "We were about 40 or 50
miles from the Swiss border. No one stopped us. Then we see a whole
platoon of Germans marching along, and we stepped into a doorway to
be inconspicuous. But it happened to be the doorway of the German
headquarters."</TE>
<TE>   Katzenbach and his comrades were caught and put back on the train.
"The SS took over and said for every one of us who escaped, two would
be shot. And for every boxcar that escaped, all the men in each
boxcar on either side would be executed. I never doubted they would
do it."</TE>
<TE>   The film crew got some of the feeling of what it was like to
survive in the harsh European winter, spending six months filming in
and around Prague, often at night, in subzero temperatures. The camp
replica was built on 400 acres, with dozens of barracks and guard
towers.</TE>
<TE>   Some Cast Members Spent a Night in the Cold</TE>
<TE>   Willis and some of the other cast members got so into the
moviemaking that they spent one night sleeping on a straw mattress in
the freezing tents that housed the POWs. When the crew began filming
the next morning, Willis "stuck his head out and said good morning,"
Hoblit recalls. Coincidentally, the film's POW consultant was Col.
Hal Cook, who was imprisoned in the same camp --Stalag Luft III--as
Nicholas Katzenbach although they did not know each other.</TE>
<TE>   What particularly attracted Hoblit to the film was the difficulty
and challenge of portraying men, all of whom are flawed, but
nonetheless who "whatever their biases, whatever their world view,
try to do the right thing." The mixture of wartime action and
courtroom (or at least court-martial) drama makes it a hard movie to
pigeonhole, and producer Ladd acknowledges that "it's something we
carefully tried to weave together seamlessly."</TE>
<TE>   However, the ad campaign is pushing "Hart's War" as a Willis
action movie, and Hoblit, for one, is not happy about that. "We had
ferocious battles about it and city hall won," he says ruefully. "The
studio wanted to unapologetically market it to the heart of the Bruce
Willis market and that's what it did."</TE>
<TE>   Although the $70-million movie does have action and suspense and
excitement, as portrayed in the commercials and previews, "what is
missing [in the ad campaign] is the dignity of men in unspeakable
conditions," Hoblit says. "It does a disservice to guys like
Nicholas. Here we are making a movie about honesty and decency and
behaving well and that's exactly what we don't behave like in selling
a movie."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, John Katzenbach says, "I think they need to put
people into the seats. If then you can say to them, here's something
you can learn at the same time, so much the better."</TE>
<TE>   The producers say the campaign may change as the movie reviews
come out and audience reaction registers, and note that,
surprisingly, the most positive response from preview audiences came
in the 30-year-old plus female group. "It doesn't look like a movie
that would appeal to that group, yet it is," Ladd says.</TE>
<TE>   For him, the movie is "a reflection of men who sacrificed a lot to
gain freedom for the free world, and if you want to know the truth, I
don't care what anyone thinks. I can't remember feeling that way
before. I feel a real sense of 'we did good.' At the end of the day,
you don't live with your grosses, you live with yourself."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From "Stalag 17" through "The Great Escape," prisoner-of-war movies
set in German camps during World War II were a lot simpler back then.
Guys groused about the enemy and tried to break out with a zeal so
convincingly parodied in the animated "Chicken Run" that it seemed
the genre had run its course. "Hart's War" tries to bring it back in
a modernized, updated form, with limited success.</LD>
<LD>   There's a lot, of course, that's comfortingly old shoe about
"Hart's War," which takes place in the mythical Stalag VIA (maybe all
the good numbers were taken) in Germany near the end of the conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Among the especially familiar elements are thuggish German guards
rushing into barracks and shouting "raus, raus" at all hours of the
day and night and the sneering Nazi officers holding cigarettes in an
affected way and saying clipped things like "Once again I am forced
to remind you that escape is not a sport." And of course those
ever-glib American soldiers always ready with a quip. Asked who's in
charge, one witty American prisoner cracks, "by the looks of things,
it's Adolf Hitler."</LD>
<TE>   Based on a novel of the same name by John Katzenbach, which was in
turn inspired by the experiences of his father, former U.S. Atty.
Gen. Nicholas Katzenbach, "Hart's War" has a lot more than business
as usual going on in its camp. There are crisp action sequences,
intense interrogations, a major subplot about racism and another
about codes of honor and betrayal. That doesn't even get into the
psychological duel between Bruce Willis' character and the German who
runs the camp that ends up morphing into a full-blown courtroom
drama.</TE>
<TE>   Given all this, it's not surprising that the script by Billy Ray
and Terry George has trouble finding a focus and maintaining
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Well-done aspects alternate with less successful ones, and the
film throws so many twists and surprises at us that it becomes
unconvincing. Only the reliable professionalism of director Gregory
Hoblit ("Frequency," "Fallen," "Primal Fear" and a lot of dramatic
TV) keeps things from getting even more out of hand than they
sometimes do.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the film's biggest surprise is its first one: Though his
huge picture in combat gear is the only thing on the "Hart's War"
poster, Willis does, in fact, not play Hart. That role goes to the
gifted Irish actor Colin Farrell, much in demand after his debut in
the Vietnam war film "Tigerland."</TE>
<TE>   It's young lieutenant Tommy Hart whose voice-over starts things
off. Stationed in Belgium, "miles from the front and a stranger to
war," Hart is wild to prove himself in battle and irked that his
powerful U.S. senator father has seen to it that combat is not on his
radar. The war, however, proves closer than Hart imagines, and the
first of numerous unexpected turns of events lands him in enemy
hands, first as the subject of intense interrogation sessions and
then as an inmate of that grim POW camp.</TE>
<TE>   At Stalag VIA, Hart is debriefed about his experiences by the
Americans' ranking officer, Col. William McNamara (Willis), a
fourth-generation West Pointer. Though he can't put his finger on
exactly why, his reception by both the great man and his fellow
officers is distinctly chilly, so much so that he is told there's no
room in the officers' tent and he'll have to bunk with the enlisted
men.</TE>
<TE>   Played by Willis in one of his most frequently utilized acting
styles--the unemotional stoic with the steely gaze--McNamara would
put the chill on any situation. No-nonsense, intense, indomitable,
the colonel is also somewhat of a cipher, someone whose thoughts and
motives only gradually become clear.</TE>
<TE>   As for Hart, he soon has lots of other things to worry about,
including the arrival of a pair of black aviators (Terrence Howard,
Vicellous Shannon) whose presence in the barracks infuriates a
standard-issue racist sergeant (Cole Hauser). The colonel puts Hart
in charge of protecting the aviators from the generally antagonistic
white soldiers they're bunking with. .</TE>
<TE>   Hart also has increasingly complex dealings with the German
officer in charge of the camp, Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures), an
unusual type who has what just might be the only set of "Negro jazz"
records in the entire Wehrmacht. Visser is engaged in a war of nerves
with McNamara, and the ways in which the lieutenant, played with an
appropriate malleability by Farrell, gets involved in this is one of
"Hart's War's" more intriguing aspects.</TE>
<TE>   Less fascinating and finally unsatisfying is the awfully familiar
racism angle, a subplot that, though unusual in a POW movie, turns
regrettably earnest and preachy almost immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Though it mostly takes place in the confines of the camp, "Hart's
War" has a good visual sense courtesy of cinematographer Alar Kivilo
as well as some involving action sequences. But though it also has
the ability to surprise you dramatically, it doesn't do that enough
to make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you couldn't get a date for Valentine's Day and you're still
feeling blue, you might want to skip John Stossel's latest special.</LD>
<LD>   "The In Crowd and Social Cruelty" (10 p.m. ABC) examines
popularity and bullying in the schoolyard--and how the pressure to be
cool can haunt us even as adults.</LD>
<LD>   Interviews with schoolchildren, psychologists and educators help
explain why some kids dish it out, why others take it and what can be
done to make things better. At a kindergarten in Maine, a
zero-tolerance policy on aggression has kept budding hooligans at
bay; at other campuses with older children, peer mediation and role
playing have eased tension, making school fun again for former
outcasts.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody treats me nicer," says bespectacled, big-eared Nick, no
longer known as "Elf Boy." "Now I like school," a girl says. "I don't
even want to go on summer vacation."</TE>
<TE>   The show wanders when Stossel, a self-proclaimed former nerd,
tries to use a personal touch to explore how childhood shapes the
adults we become. In an awkward surprise reunion, he and a handful of
his high school classmates gawk at their yearbook photos and lament
how uncool they were.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Stossel heads to a chic New York night spot to see if he
can glide past the velvet rope now that he's on TV. Will the bouncer
let him into the in crowd at long last--or smack him around a little,
just on principle?</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you come to the cabaret at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center next season, expect to hear the sisterhood of song, not the
brotherhood.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002-2003 cabaret season offers seven female headliners,
including a one-night stand by three-time Tony Award winner Audra
McDonald in the 3,000-seat Segerstrom Hall. The only male voices will
be heard during an eighth show, a three-week run of the musical
spoof, "Forbidden Hollywood," a spinoff from the successful satiric
franchise, "Forbidden Broadway."</LD>
<LD>   Other than the McDonald concert, the shows will take place in the
300-seat Founders Hall. Maureen McGovern, whose career highlights
include singing two Oscar-winning songs, "The Morning After" from
"The Poseidon Adventure" and "We May Never Love Like This Again" from
"The Towering Inferno," is the biggest name playing the small room.
The others are: veteran singer-actress Polly Bergen; Donna Murphy,
twice a Tony winner for roles in "Passion" and "The King and I";
Christine Ebersole, a Tony winner in "42nd Street"; Wesla Whitfield,
whose main genre is cabaret rather than musical theater; and Donna
McKechnie, who won her Tony as Cassie in "A Chorus Line."</LD>
<TE>   The schedule: Audra McDonald, June 29; "Forbidden Broadway," Sept.
4-22; Polly Bergen, Oct. 1-5; Donna Murphy, Nov. 12-16; Maureen
McGovern, Dec. 10-14; Christine Ebersole, Jan. 28-Feb. 1, 2003; Wesla
Whitfield, Feb. 18-22, 2003; Donna McKechnie, March 25-28, 2003.
Subscriptions for the six shows other than McDonald and "Forbidden
Hollywood" cost $252. Single ticket prices are $32-$62 for McDonald's
concert and $49 for "Forbidden Hollywood." (714) 556-2787.</TE>

<HD>An Asian Tightrope for Bush</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush leaves Saturday for a weeklong trip to Japan, South
Korea and China. All three deserve the president's thanks for
supporting his war on terrorism. Then Bush must show Olympic-caliber
balance as he skates between public and private diplomacy.</LD>
<LD>   At the United States' urging, Japan has its warships out
patrolling the Indian Ocean in support of coalition forces fighting
in Afghanistan. But at home, it is suffering a decade-long economic
stagnation that threatens to spread across Asia and the Pacific.
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi now appears less the economic
reformer than he claimed to be in campaigning for office. Bush should
stress the need for systemic reform, especially in the banking
sector, and offer support for Koizumi's original plans to overhaul
the Japanese economy. Cowboy swagger won't cut it, though. Too blunt
and public a lecture would only embolden economic reform's
conservative opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's second stop is South Korea, home to 37,000 U.S. troops,
many of them close to the border with North Korea, one of the nations
the president described as an "axis of evil" in his State of the
Union speech. The troops provide visible evidence of the mutual
interest of Asia and the United States in regional stability.</LD>
<TE>   President Kim Dae Jung won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for trying
to start the reunification of the two Koreas nearly half a century
after the Korean War. Unfortunately, North Korea has not lived up to
its end of a deal, and public opinion has turned against Kim in South
Korea. Last year, during Kim's White House visit, Bush expressed
skepticism about North Korean intentions, embarrassing the South
Korean leader.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Kim both want North Korea to fulfill its international
obligations. Both want the Stalinist regime to change course and
allow international inspectors to verify that it is not developing
nuclear weapons. The question is how best to use leverage of the
United States, Japan and South Korea, which have joined to provide
the money, food and oil that North Korea desperately needs.</TE>
<TE>   On his next stop, China, Bush should urge Beijing--one of North
Korea's few allies--to lean on Pyongyang to reopen talks with the
South and reduce tensions. He should also bring up China's need to
comply with regulations of the World Trade Organization, which it
joined two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, U.S. officials ought to meet with the men expected to
succeed President Jiang Zemin and other leaders within the next year;
diplomacy aside, the U.S. commitment to religious freedom, human
rights, an end to repression in Tibet and peaceful settlement of
differences with Taiwan should be stressed. It is no help that China
Thursday detained 40 Western followers of the outlawed religious
movement Falun Gong in Tiananmen Square.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades have passed since President Nixon's historic visit
to China and more than a dozen years since Chinese troops slaughtered
democracy activists during demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. In
recent months, relations with China have been back on a more even
keel; the visit is a chance to remind Beijing of what it takes to
preserve a mutually positive relationship.</TE>

<LD>Re "Teamsters Seeking to Represent the LAPD," Feb. 12: So the rank
and file of the LAPD are considering having the Teamsters represent
them. Let me understand this. They want to be represented by the same
Teamsters Union once headed by the apparently late Jimmy Hoffa, who
it seems has met a mob ending. The same Teamsters Union that was
taken over by a federal supervisor in face of rampant internal
corruption. The same Teamsters Union that has used mob-style
enforcement and lead pipes in support of its "labor actions," and has
destroyed the property of those who have had the temerity to cross
its picket lines.</LD>
<LD>   And these are the police officers who serve under the motto "to
protect and serve"? Gentlemen, I can appreciate your effort to avoid
the assault on Chief Bernard Parks by the Police Protective League,
but this is not the way to win the hearts of the citizens of Los
Angeles or to establish yourselves as serious keepers of the public
trust.</LD>

up the most insightful commentator out there, but I'll take it ("An
Unholy Alliance of Two Wars--on Terrorism and Drugs," Commentary,
Feb. 8)! Her brilliant characterization of the misguided co-mingling
of the drug war with the terrorism war was a fascinating study in
wasteful Washington spending designed to prop up the ultimately
futile prohibition.</LD>

<HD>Beastly Bit of Judging</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's inspiring to witness the finest contestants gather from around
the world to compete in what should be a prime-time celebration of
talents, goodwill and international friendship. And it's saddening to
see emotional bitterness, accusations and hard feelings erupt over
charges of unfair subjective scoring by nationalist judges. That's
why the Westminster Kennel Club must make a prompt, fur-reaching
investigation to avoid repeating the messy controversy surrounding
this week's Westminster Dog Show in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Even tape-delayed, the winner of the coveted best in show award, a
miniature poodle named Surrey Spice Girl, appeared to bound once
during her parade prance. The crowd gasped. Points should have been
deducted. No one questioned her first place in nonsporting dogs over
a bichon frise that was far too frise. But thousands of Madison
Square Garden fans favored a German shepherd named Kismets Sight for
Sore Eyes, and a border collie, Trumagik Tartan Trekker. In fact,
while judges' votes were tallied, the crowd chanted the dogs' full
names.</LD>
<TE>   The decision to name a tiny black poodle as alpha dog caused
stunned silence and then a chorus of chaos among competitors, who
fortunately were leashed. German dogs and Scottish and Australian
collies joined by Welsh corgis denounced unfair bloc voting by French
poodles, Maltese, Chinese cresteds, Tibetan terriers and even
Chihuahuas to deny top dog honors to breeds that actually work.
According to one report, a French judge privately admitted accepting
Asian votes in exchange for her support of Pekinese, Lhasa apsos and
Shih Tzus. Irish wolfhounds, Norwegian elkhounds, Polish sheepdogs,
Siberians and even Afghans sided with highland terriers and English
spaniels. Canada's contestant, a Labrador, was en route to Salt Lake
City for "personal reasons." One Doberman dismissed the miniature
French winner as "a walking snack that can't even bark."</TE>
<TE>   It's tragic when petty ethnic controversies erupt. Dogs should be
judged by their performance, not just the color or length of their
fur. The dispute only reveals how stubborn are lingering
nationalistic jealousies. We hope that humans will not be trained to
emulate this dog-fighting at international sporting events.</TE>

<LD>The House of Representatives' vote Thursday to drain "a swamp of
special interest money" cleared the most formidable barrier to the
proposed campaign reforms of the Shays-Meehan bill. Senate opponents
who had threatened a filibuster appeared late Thursday to be giving
up, not wanting to be publicly tarred as reform-killers. However,
President Bush still hasn't agreed to sign the measure into law.
Celebrations are in order. So is readiness to continue the fight.</LD>
<LD>   It was the Enron scandal that breathed life into dying campaign
finance reform. The stories of the company's byzantine
influence-buying in the Capitol, including $3.5 million in
unregulated campaign contributions over a decade, reinvigorated
efforts to do away with the giant loopholes in current law.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, as politicians ceaselessly chased corporate,
union and other special interest money, voters felt more and more
powerless. Turnout, even in major elections, stagnated. Although the
Senate passed its own version of campaign reform last year, by Sens.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), everyone knew
the House was a tougher case. Until Enron.</LD>
<TE>   The stakes now could not be higher. The bill, named after its
tireless sponsors, Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin T.
Meehan (D-Mass.), promises to purge much of the money that has
corrupted politics. It would ban federal officeholders and candidates
from soliciting "soft money," which evades direct contribution limits
but effectively is used to pay for campaign ads. It prohibits labor
unions and corporations from running "independent" ads 60 days before
a general election, 30 days before a primary.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, all of California's House Democrats (including Rep.
Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, author of the apt swamp metaphor),
voted for reform. Special marks for courage go to GOP Reps. Stephen
Horn of Long Beach and Doug Ose of Sacramento, who gave their
support. Contrast them with Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who
previously voted for reform but caved in and opposed Shays-Meehan in
a key vote Monday.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders, certain that the current pell-mell money chase gives
them an edge over the Democrats, still want to kill Shays-Meehan.
Even if the Senate passes it and Bush signs it, Sen. Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) has promised a court challenge. Is this the legacy McConnell
wants to leave, that he litigated honorable reform to death?</TE>
<TE>   The taint of monied influence on American democracy must be
reduced. Campaign finance reform is not a luxury.</TE>

<HD>Milosevic Ravaged Yugoslavia</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Slobodan Milosevic Is the Scapegoat in a Show Trial," Commentary,
Feb. 12: I was left speechless at the attempt to portray Slobodan
Milosevic as a victim. The authors have an unbelievable ability to
ignore the mountains of evidence of Milosevic's strategy of a Greater
Serbia. Whose army laid siege to Vukovar in Croatia? Where did the
artillery shells come from that pounded Sarajevo for three years?</LD>
<LD>   Marko Luposina and Andre Huzsvai dismiss the "overblown issues of
'rape camps' to 'concentration camps.' " Can the significance of
concentration camps in Europe in the 20th century be "overblown"?
Virtually the only defenders of Milosevic left are many of the
Serbian people, who were fed the official version of events with
themselves portrayed as victims (much as Germans felt themselves
victims after losing World War I). Many Serbs, however, have slowly
awakened to the ravages Milosevic has done to their own country: a
shrunken, impoverished state, ravaged by nationalist thugs. The
testimony at the Hague trial will open their eyes to what this man
and this philosophy did to the rest of Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas Schwartz</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is absurd for Lopusina and Huzsvai to argue that there was a
long-term NATO (read American) strategy to take over the Balkans.
President Clinton had to be dragged into the Bosnian and Kosovo
quagmires, and the American public certainly never clamored for
intervention. To this day, it is hard to construct any rationale
based on national interest for our interventions. The truth is, we
used our military power to stop a madman from carrying out his dreams
of a "Greater Serbia" based on violence toward others.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic now finds himself on trial for his war crimes. There
were crimes committed by Croats and Muslims, and the writers fail to
note that Croats and Muslims have also been indicted and stood trial
in The Hague. It is not simply "victor's justice" but a serious
attempt to bring justice to at least the leading war criminals of all
sides. But no fair reading of Balkan history would be complete
without noting the prime and despicable role of Milosevic. His
apologists even now seek to obfuscate this basic fact.</TE>

<HD>Skating's Close Call: Award Joint Medals</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Skating on Thin Ice Over Judging," Feb. 13: It was disheartening
to see that Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier's thrilling
Olympic pairs figure skating performance was not recognized as gold
medal-worthy by the skating judges.</LD>
<LD>   The public and the critics will always remember that the two
skaters deserved the gold. However, it's not likely that the
International Skating Union or the Olympic committee will reverse the
judging unless gross corruption is uncovered. Also, it would not be
fair to take the gold medal away from the Russians, who did their
best to give a winning performance. Let me therefore suggest the
following:</LD>
<LD>   It is high time that we recognize that sometimes there are sports
performances where subjective input is present to such a degree that
letting personal judging preference influence the medal order is
simply not acceptable. Why not use this occasion to start a new
Olympic trend: Have the Olympic committee declare that Sale and
Pelletier skated such an outstanding performance that they also
deserve a gold medal. And that since the Olympic Games are truly
about performing one's best, new rules will be enacted to account for
performances that deserve to receive joint gold medals.</LD>
<TE>   It will please everyone, and it will be just.</TE>
<TE>   Ronny Barkay</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Public opinion is not judicial opinion. Your article highlights a
power that does not exist. Public opinion can and should change rules
only, not those who perform under them. In this latest sports
controversy, even the skaters are irrelevant to questioning the
judges' decision. The only thing the public should judge is the
rules, not the judges.</TE>

<LD>What a great juxtaposition of articles on your Feb. 13 Commentary
page. James Pinkerton explains how deregulated electricity, at its
best, saves the average household $10 a month--while minimizing the
billions that it costs when deregulation is at its worst ("Enron Is
but a Pebble in the Wave").</LD>
<LD>   Bart Kosko, on the other hand, explains the Nobel Prize-winning
Nash equilibrium, showing "how selfish competitors should act in
relation to those whom they compete against" ("How Many Blonds Mess
Up a Nash Equilibrium?").</LD>
<LD>   Consumers would be like the rabbits and deer in Kosko's article.
When deregulated suppliers compete individually, they each get
rabbits and consumers save their $10 a month. When deregulated
suppliers cooperate, they get a deer and consumers pay billions.</LD>
<TE>   Deregulation unleashes the hunt for deer among infrastructure
suppliers and traders. Only regulation can keep them satisfied with
rabbits.</TE>

<LD>Re "New Role for Onetime Pariah," editorial, Feb. 13: As you state,
"The United States' relationship with Pakistan is for the long run."
It is needed to control drug trafficking, to curb arms smuggling and
to contain terrorists and extremists. Pakistan needs economic help to
save it from bankruptcy, but any military help might interfere in the
internal affairs of Afghanistan and India, as it has led to the
current disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's territorial integrity should be defended, but there
should be no extraterritorial expansion. Pakistan's leaders'
cooperation to fight terrorism has the double meaning of freedom
fighting and liberation. President Bush should draw a line between
our interests in fighting terrorism and Pakistan's leaders'
definition of terrorism in return for the aid offered.</LD>

<LD>Re "House OKs Campaign Finance Bill," Feb. 14: Money is the mother's
milk of politics. There will never be a federal election free of the
influence of large donors. The Shays-Meehan bill merely changes how
influence is bought. Public financing of campaigns is even worse. Who
chooses who gets the money? Only an aggressively self-informed
electorate that goes beyond the superficial presentations of
candidates and advocacy groups to gather and assess conflicting
points of view can make a fundamental change in how campaigns are
waged and won.</LD>

<TE>   The campaign finance problem was institutionalized when the
Supreme Court ruled that money is speech and therefore political
donations are protected by the 1st Amendment. Money is money and
speech is speech. I have no difficulty separating them in my mind.
The result of the court's ruling is that those with money get to
speak a lot more and a lot louder than others, although what they are
saying is often kept secret from the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   I believe that campaigns should be funded with tax dollars and
that candidates and their supporters should get to speak on the
public dime. Everyone will get to have their say; members of the
electorate can decide on the basis of what they see and hear, and
there will be no major contributors with special access or influence.
Wouldn't that be refreshing?</TE>

<TE>   I watched the campaign finance debate in the House Wednesday on
C-Span. Mostly, the camera focused on the speakers. However, when
they showed the chamber as a whole, it was apparent that it was
almost empty! How can our representatives adequately evaluate each
issue brought forth unless they are there to listen to the debate?
Does this suggest that most of them already have their minds made up
(or made up for them by the party bosses and large donors)? I would
say yes, and that the debate was just for show.</TE>

<HD>Call for Better Audits of Public Companies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rep. Richard Baker's (R-La.) suggestion that auditors be retained by
the stock exchanges to audit public companies and that the fees be
paid out of a fund created by levies on the companies does sound
"imaginative," as Ronald Brownstein calls it (Feb. 11). The
protections afforded investors who rely on audits are only as good as
the quality of the audits and the competency of the auditors.</LD>
<LD>   Baker's proposal brings to mind two comparisons, HMOs and baggage
checkers at airports. In an effort to provide the "appearance" of
absolute independence, Baker would have Congress turn the auditing
profession into what is only a small step away from a unionized
bureaucracy of the semi-competent. Like so many congressional
solutions, Baker's proposal brings to mind H.L. Mencken's comment
that for every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple,
elegant and wrong.</LD>

<LD>British Judge Timothy Workman's ruling to release on bail the
suspected "lead trainer" of the Sept. 11 skyjackers requires the U.S.
under the Bush terrorism doctrine to forthwith invade England (Feb.
13). We must oust the terrorist-leaning government and replace it
with a more sympathetic regime. If the queen is cooperative and
sufficiently anti-terrorist to suspend British due process of law, we
can reinstate the monarchy and send Parliament and the British
judiciary to prison camps in Cuba. How is this any different than our
actions against Afghanistan?</LD>

<HD>Senate Set to Introduce Bills to Prevent Another Enron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Democratic leaders promised Thursday to draft a series of
comprehensive bills addressing the causes and consequences of Enron
Corp.'s failure, and to push for their passage by year's end.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said four committees
would attempt to improve on existing law in the areas of investor
protection, retirement security, corporate tax shelters and
securities fraud.</LD>
<LD>   A fifth committee will pursue a wide-ranging investigation of
Enron's rise and fall in an effort to "hold the culprits
accountable," in the words of Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who will
help direct the probe.</LD>
<TE>   "It's our intention to pass whatever new laws are needed before
the end of this Congress," Daschle said. "We can't afford to
wait....We cannot allow what happened to Enron employees to happen to
the rest of America."</TE>
<TE>   The energy company--one of the largest corporations in the United
States last year--filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, shredding
billions of dollars in shareholder equity and costing many employees
their jobs and their retirement savings. Because of a change in
retirement plan administrators, employees were locked out of selling
their shares in the weeks before the bankruptcy protection filing.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said the Senate's efforts to help
former Enron employees would go beyond the pension reforms proposed
by President Bush, possibly by requiring greater diversification of
assets in 401(k) retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The legislation will make sure that workers are never again
forced into being captive investors who risk their retirement savings
on the fate of a single company," said Kennedy, chairman of the
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 60% of the total value of Enron's 401(k) plan at the end
of 2000 was invested in company shares, and many employees lost the
bulk of their savings when the stock price collapsed. Although
mandatory diversification would limit such losses, it is a
controversial concept because it restricts the ability of workers to
choose their investments.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans also are offering legislative remedies, including a
proposal to prohibit executives from buying or selling company stock
during any period where 401(k) participants are unable to do so. They
also have introduced legislation to mandate increased financial
disclosure by corporations and provide for greater oversight of
accounting firms. Enron has claimed that its auditor, Andersen,
raised no objections to Enron's aggressive accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said Enron's failure has revealed the "dark side" of
requiring workers to assume more pension-plan risk, a trend that
could accelerate if Republicans manage to privatize a portion of the
Social Security system.</TE>
<TE>   "Privatization is just a fancy word for shifting more retirement
security risk onto average Americans," he said. "We believe that's
the wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), whose
panel is interested in increasing criminal penalties for securities
fraud, cited Enron's elaborate network of off-the-books investment
partnerships as evidence of the need for reform.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about a spider's web of deceit, that's what Enron did,"
Leahy told reporters. "The criminal code is not adequate for it.
We'll make it adequate."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Governmental
Affairs Committee, expressed confidence that the Senate could begin
drafting legislation even though about a dozen congressional panels
are still in the initial stages of assessing Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "We see the outlines of the loopholes in the law that Enron went
through," Lieberman said. "I think we know enough to begin the
process of legislating."</TE>
<TE>   The senators met with reporters at a joint news conference.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, meanwhile, Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) said he was drafting legislation to create a universal
pension system that workers could take with them from one job to
another.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would consolidate 16 existing pension programs,
Gephardt said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined two other
senators in introducing a bill to give regulatory oversight to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission over derivative
transactions--which are essentially contracts based on the future
price or performance of an underlying asset.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has heard testimony suggesting that Enron used its clout
in this market to artificially boost power costs, a charge the
company has denied.</TE>

<HD>Economic Data Boost Dow; Tech Slides on Debt Fears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology stocks slid Thursday on fears about mounting debt in the
telecom sector and more accounting blowups, but upbeat economic data
lifted the Dow Jones industrial average over the key 10,000 mark for
the first time in five weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "The market's still a little bit on the timid side when they see
all these big players in the telecommunications side running into
problems, and that's going to trickle down into the broader market,"
said Keith Janecek of Legg Mason Wood Walker.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest International, the No. 4 U.S. local phone company, reignited
market concerns about ballooning corporate bankruptcies after it was
forced to dig into its backup credit line and had its debt downgraded
by Standard &amp; Poor's. Its shares fell $1.10 to $7.49, a 52-week low.</LD>
<TE>   Accounting concerns also were still gnawing at the market after a
string of scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are legitimately concerned about seeing a stock they
own be worth half its current price in a short period of time," said
Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView. "They're
often not waiting around to see if this really is in the category of
Enron or if it's really not. "</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials gained 12.32 points, or 0.1%, to 10,001.99,
closing above 10,000 for the first time since Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 2.03 points, or 0.2%, to
1,116.48, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 15.79 points, or
0.9%, to 1,843.37.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and were about even on the
New York Stock Exchange. Trading was moderate in advance of today's
options expiration session. The market will be closed Monday for
Presidents Day.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks rose at the opening after the Labor Department said initial
jobless claims fell last week, totaling less than 400,000 for a sixth
week, a sign that U.S. payrolls are as lean as they will get. In
addition, the Commerce Department reported that business inventories
fell in December to their lowest level in two years.</TE>
<TE>   But the gains evaporated after S&amp;P downgraded Qwest's debt about
two hours before the market closed.</TE>
<TE>   Conglomerate Tyco International and data storage company EMC were
among those caught in the cross-fire as investors questioned the
honesty of corporate America's financial statements in the wake of
the collapse of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco fell $2.15 to $26.75 amid lingering uncertainty over its
breakup plan announced last month, just a day after it issued a
profit warning. EMC lost 59 cents to $13.90 as the No. 1 maker of
data storage systems was hit by concerns that it improperly booked
revenue with some customers.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Gap shares fell 55 cents to $12.79 after S&amp;P cut its credit
ratings to "junk" status, saying the largest U.S. apparel retailer
has suffered from disappointing earnings and sales in a weak economy
and a poor retail environment.</TE>
<TE>   * Juniper Networks fell $2.09 to $10.92, and rival Cisco Systems
sagged 6 cents to $17.46. Cisco, the world's No. 1 maker of gear used
to manage Internet traffic, extended its share of the market during
the fourth quarter over Juniper, according to Dell'Oro Group.</TE>
<TE>   * PayPal sold 5.4 million shares at $13, raising $70.2 million in
an initial stock offering that was delayed a week by a lawsuit. The
online payment provider will begin trading today on Nasdaq under the
symbol PYPL.</TE>
<TE>   * Brocade Communications fell $2.56 to $32.64. The company
reported weaker quarterly results amid slumping demand for storage
networking equipment.</TE>
<TE>   * Qwest led telecom stocks lower. The Amex telecom index fell 2.8%
to a 52-week low. Other losers included Sprint PCS, down $1.42 to
$10.20, and Nextel Communications, off 17 cents to $4.85.</TE>
<TE>   * Incyte Genomics Inc. shares fell $3.07 to $11.91 after the
company said its fourth-quarter loss widened because of restructuring
and acquisition costs and a decline in revenue.</TE>

<HD>Qwest to Tap Full Credit Line</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Move by firm to draw down $4 billion comes after
its credit ratings are lowered. Shares fall 13%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. said Thursday that it would
draw down its $4 billion in bank credit lines, acknowledging it had
been shut out of the corporate bond market amid investor worries over
telecom industry accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came after major credit-rating companies lowered
their ratings of Qwest, helping to further pummel its shares, which
already are at their lowest since 1997. The stock fell $1.10, or 13%,
to close at $7.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, Qwest--the dominant local phone company in 14
Western states--was unable to roll over $700 million to $800 million
in short-term debt and was forced to draw down $1 billion of its
$4-billion credit line.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the company tapped the full credit line and said it
would use the bank loan to pay down all of its $3.2 billion of
commercial paper, or short-term notes.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest said that with the loan, its debt load stands at $24.9
billion. The company said it still plans to reduce its debt by $1.5
billion to $2billion and is considering asset sales. The company,
which owns a major fiber-optic network and in 2000 bought Baby Bell
U.S. West, said it also is exploring its long-term financing options.</TE>
<TE>   "These steps address the short-term ... liquidity needs while
allowing us to focus on executing on our strategy to grow our
business, strengthen our balance sheet and generate free cash flow,"
Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Nacchio must demonstrate that the local phone
operations can generate enough cash flow to service the firm's debt
and fund growth of new telecom services.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest's sudden troubles stem from worries about its accounting
practices, which have come under increased scrutiny since the
collapse of fiber-optic network operator Global Crossing Ltd. and
Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Denver-based Qwest said its accounting has been above-board, but
investors are fleeing any stock where there is any hint that
accounting may be challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's on Thursday lowered its long-term corporate
credit rating on Qwest and its subsidiaries to BBB from BBB+ and gave
it a negative outlook.</TE>
<TE>   "The downgrade is based on Qwest's more limited financial
flexibility and near-term liquidity concerns, a challenging operating
environment and uncertainty regarding the implications" for certain
accounting methods used by the industry, S&amp;P analyst Greg Zappin
said.</TE>

<LD>Liberty Media's plan to become Germany's dominant cable-TV operator
hit a new hurdle when regulators warned they may prevent the U.S.

<LD>   Liberty Media wants to purchase the network from Deutsche Bank to
complement a $4.9-billion deal in which it would buy six regional

<HD>Japan Needs a Jolt to Force It to Act Decisively on Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>A jaundiced view gaining favor in some Japanese quarters holds that
the biggest threat to this nation's long-term economic health isn't
so much that it will suffer a financial crisis before the end of
March, but that it won't.</LD>
<LD>   Japan is so paralyzed and in need of a push, some now argue, that
the only way it will be forced to act decisively, break its policy
logjam and address its enormous bad debt problem is for it to weather
a seismic jolt.</LD>
<LD>   "In sharp contrast to Americans, Japanese don't mind suffering as
long as everyone is in it together," said Atsuo Mihara, an
independent economic critic. "We can't seem to react to a crisis
until it's right in front of us. It's part of our DNA."</LD>
<TE>   The latest blow to Japan's battered prestige came this week when
U.S. rating service Moody's said it was considering a two-notch
downgrade of Japanese government debt that would put the world's
second-largest economy on par with Poland, Latvia and South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   There are growing concerns overseas and at the highest reaches of
the Bush administration in advance of next week's summit in Tokyo
that Japan's financial picture could get very ugly between now and
March 31--the end of the fiscal year, when Japanese firms and banks
close their accounts.</TE>
<TE>   But the view from Tokyo is that the nation once again will muddle
through.</TE>
<TE>   One major reason, as seen by Moody's announcement, is that Japan's
approach, wealth, structure, regulations and the government's
willingness to spend huge sums on stopgaps seriously blunt the effect
of global market pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In Moody's case, for example, only 5% of Japanese government bonds
are held by foreigners. The rest are held by domestic institutions
that don't worry much about what Moody's thinks, even as they succumb
to government pressure not to sell. Another worrisome blob on Japan's
radar screen is low stock prices. Japanese banks and companies have
traditionally held large stakes among themselves, so a tanking market
leading up to March 31 settlements is a potentially huge problem for
banks hoping to preserve their capital.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the benchmark Nikkei average is 6% higher than the last
book closing in late September, with the market opening Friday
slightly lower.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Japan has announced a $15-billion fund to buy
depressed stocks from banks and hold them for several years, which
analysts believe helps explain the market's recent rise.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, critics charge, Japan has opted to mask its problems
with a short-term fix rather than listening to market signals that
entire industries should be overhauled.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, parts of Japan are changing rapidly, particularly in the
private sector. And there's still a huge perception gap as many
Japanese feel battered by rapid economic transformation even as
foreigners see torpor.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a government led by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party for
the last half a century and long beholden to inefficient farmers,
construction companies and retailers has displayed a dogged
resistance to fundamental change.</TE>
<TE>   A package of anti-deflationary measures released Thursday  is seen
as little more than a show of good intent in advance of President
Bush's Sunday arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Japan also has been helped in dodging incoming bullets by the
enormous capital surplus it's amassed through decades of trade
surpluses as consumers around the world stocked up on Japanese
televisions, cars and DVD players.</TE>
<TE>   A recent look at financial meltdowns from Argentina and Thailand
to Mexico, South Korea and Brazil by HSBC Securities found that Japan
lacked the common ingredients seen in free-fall cases elsewhere,
namely high foreign debt, limited overseas assets and high inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Japan still  has the world's largest current account surplus and
some of the worst deflation in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   Japan also may benefit from early signs the U.S. could bounce back
relatively soon. Some Japanese exporters are seeing early improvement
even as domestic inventory levels are pared back.</TE>
<TE>   Although this won't guarantee much real growth, analysts say, it
could dampen the slide as Japan weathers its third, and most
protracted, recession in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Another blow that could upend the Fuji apple cart would be a few
corporate failures in rapid succession or a toppling of a major life
insurer.  Also leading to fears of a March meltdown is the risk of
bank failures, leading depositors to make a run on weaker
institutions and spread panic.</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt Japan is pushing its luck as its financial health
deteriorates, and its increasingly wobbly condition leaves it more
vulnerable to a blow from a direction it hasn't anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of bad debt held by banks--which the government pegs at
$138 billion and private investment firms say is four times that
amount--is far worse than the U.S. savings and loan crisis at its
nadir and is piling up faster in a deflationary environment than it
can be written off.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Japan has displayed an uncanny ability to scrape through
one close call after another over the last "lost decade."</TE>
<TE>   The question is at what cost. The last decade has seen Japan spend
$100 trillion in real estate and investment wealth as government and
private debt loads now threaten to weigh down its people for
generations.</TE>

<HD>Investors Pound PacifiCare After Blunt Analyst Warnings</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Santa Ana HMO's stock continues its fall amid
concerns it hasn't been upfront about earnings outlook and legal
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Analysts and investors slammed PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. on
Thursday, driving its stock price down 7% amid accusations that the
company had been less than frank about its legal problems in Texas
and its earnings outlook.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana-based PacifiCare, which is trying to right itself with
an ambitious restructuring plan, has seen its stock tumble 20% in the
last four days; its shares fell $1.29 to close at $16.80 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's biggest Medicare operator already faced significant
challenges, slashing jobs and trying to reinvent itself as it moved
from a fixed-payment HMO business model to a "shared risk" model in a
search for better profit. Then came the announcement Monday that
Texas was suing its affiliate in that state "for violations of state
laws that have resulted in millions of dollars in unpaid claims,
disrupted patient care and unresolved complaints."</LD>
<TE>   That set off a crescendo Thursday in which analysts sounded like
betrayed suitors, using unusually blunt language for Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch punctuated its "sell" rating with a statement that
PacifiCare's Wednesday earnings report had failed to instill
confidence about the company's future or the soundness of its
business plan. "Bottom line, PacifiCare not only failed to meet
estimates but reported a quarter that did little to dispel concerns
about its business model or future prospects," Merrill Lynch analyst
Roberta Goodman wrote in a research report.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the many shifting parts, the turbulent Medicare
environment, the shift away from [fixed fees], and the Alamo-like
siege in Texas, it's difficult to have much confidence in our
forecasts" of PacifiCare's prospects, Banc of America analyst Todd
Richter said in a research note.</TE>
<TE>   Another analyst, Sheryl Skolnick of Fulcrum Global Partners,
accused PacifiCare of the "sin of omission" by not sharing with
investors its increasingly contentious negotiations with state
officials in Texas. "The company commits the sin of omission on
numerous occasions and investors still buy the stock," wrote
Skolnick, who has a "sell" rating on PacifiCare. "Pardon our outrage,
but we fail to understand how anyone managing anyone else's money can
purchase these shares."</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare officials said the company had been involved in
negotiations in good faith with Texas officials and had been hoping
to reach a settlement when it found out the lawsuit had been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Phanstiel, PacifiCare president and chief executive, told
investors Thursday that he was confident about his company's position
in the Texas case, that PacifiCare had no legal liability and that
"we are in full compliance with the Texas Department of Insurance
regarding the timeliness of claims resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Shirley, vice president of investor relations for
PacifiCare, said the company was open in all of its negotiations with
Texas officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We exchange information with regulators all of the time. It's a
request for information. It's not something we are required to
disclose," Shirley said. "We were trying to reach a global settlement
with the Texas Department of Insurance. We were shocked and
disappointed to hear that the lawsuit had been filed. Our business is
very solid. We are just going to have to keep proving it quarter
after quarter."</TE>
<TE>   That won't be easy, said Peter Boland, a management consultant and
industry analyst, because the criticism of PacifiCare is acquiring a
momentum of its own.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have a major restructuring plan, it's never quick or
pretty or easy. It's usually a multiyear problem. Now, there is a
lack of confidence. The investors are saying that they see
fundamental problems with PacifiCare's business model and they are
simply not sure when and if it will be turned around," Boland said.</TE>

<HD>Dick Clark Agrees to Sell Namesake Production Firm</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Assets in the $140-million deal include
classic film clips of performers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pop icon Dick Clark reached an agreement Thursday to sell his
independent television production company, which produces shows such
as "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve," and the "Golden Globe
Awards," to a group of private investors for $140 million, the
company said.</LD>
<LD>   Clark, 72, will remain chairman and chief executive of the company
that he formed in 1957--the year his show, "American Bandstand," made
the leap from a local Philadelphia production to a national audience
on the ABC network.</LD>
<LD>   The investors acquiring Dick Clark Productions Inc. include Mosaic
Media Group, Capital Communications CDPQ Inc. and entertainment
industry veteran Jules Haimovitz, who will become vice chairman of
Dick Clark Productions.</LD>
<TE>   "We can bring our talents and resources of these different
companies and take [Dick Clark Productions] to the next level," said
Haimovitz, former president of Spelling Entertainment Inc. and a
consultant to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. "We're hoping to grow into a
much larger corporate entity."</TE>
<TE>   The partners agreed to pay $14.50 a share in cash to shareholders
with the intent of taking the company private. Clark will receive
$12.50 a share, but he plans to reinvest an undisclosed amount back
into the new partnership. Clark owned more than 70% of the company,
making his holdings worth nearly $95 million.</TE>
<TE>   How much cash Clark will receive was not disclosed. The investors
also would not say what percentage of the company each of them would
own, although none will have a majority interest. The company's
assets include $65 million in cash and a decades-spanning film
library that includes classic clips of music personalities, from
Chubby Checker to Frankie Avalon.</TE>
<TE>   The company will remain in Burbank and continue to operate as an
independent production firm.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the company soared Thursday after the announcement,
closing up $3.37 to $14.30 in Nasdaq trading, an increase of nearly
31%.</TE>
<TE>   The company had sales of $70.8 million in the last fiscal year and
made $5.2 million in profit--a 50% drop from the previous year. In
the latest quarter ended Sept. 30, 2001, the company reported a loss
of $275,000, due mainly to a slowdown in television production and
losses from a chain of "Dick Clark American Bandstand," casual
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was traveling on Thursday and could not be reached for
comment. But Francis C. La Maina , president and chief operating
officer for Dick Clark Productions, downplayed speculation that the
seemingly ageless showman was selling the company because he wanted
to slow down.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick will remain as active as he has ever been," said La Maina,
who has worked with Clark for 35 years. "He will continue to work
until he can't work any more. His work is his love."</TE>
<TE>   La Maina, who will also stay on in his current position, said the
investors have promised to bring additional capital to expand Dick
Clark Productions: "We'd like to explore other opportunities in other
areas of television, not only events, but other areas."</TE>
<TE>   La Maina, Haimovitz and Allen Shapiro, Mosaic's president, all
declined to discuss targets for acquisition or potential projects to
grow Dick Clark Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the company's value comes from its library of film clips.
In addition to "American Bandstand," which went off the air in 1989,
the company has produced "TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes," "The
American Music Awards," "Daytime Emmy Awards" and the "Academy of
Country Music Awards."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Guidant Corp. can't collect a $140-million jury award in a patent
case and may owe millions of dollars in penalties, because its key
witness lied in the dispute with rival cardiac device maker St. Jude
Medical Inc., a judge said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge David F. Hamilton overturned the jury award in
the dispute over patents for implantable defibrillators, which are
used to restore normal heart rhythm. Guidant's chief expert witness,
Purdue University biomedical engineer Joe D. Bourland, "deceived the
jury, deceived the court and deceived St. Jude," Hamilton said.</LD>
<LD>   Bourland could not be reached for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of St. Paul, Minn.-based St. Jude rose 65 cents to $79.15.
Shares of Indianapolis-based Guidant fell 10 cents to $49.80. Both
trade on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>U.S. business inventories fell in December to the lowest level in two
years--another sign the economy is working out the excesses of the
late-1990s boom and readying for a turnaround, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate report, the government said the number of workers
seeking first-time jobless benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally
adjusted 373,000 in the week ended Feb. 9. The four-week moving
average of claims fell to 376,000, its lowest level since mid-August.</LD>
<LD>   The business inventories data showed manufacturers, wholesalers
and retailers overall recorded a 0.4% decline in the value of goods
on their shelves in December, to a seasonally adjusted $1.14
trillion, the Commerce Department said. It followed a revised 1.2%
November decrease.</LD>
<TE>   Goods stockpiles were down 6% in December from a year earlier.
Business sales in December inched up to $817.5 billion from $817.3
billion in November.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Labor Department said U.S. import prices rose 0.4% in
January.</TE>

<LD>Federal regulators approved the use of a new wireless technology that
could help rescue workers find people buried in rubble or locate
stresses in the side of a bridge, overcoming fears it would interfere
with important navigation aids.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to approve
limited use of ultra-wideband technology for hand-held wireless
communications, ground-penetrating radar and vehicle collision
avoidance systems.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC approved the marketing and operation of products using UWB
technology but limited it to the range above the 3.1-gigahertz
frequency and, in some cases, restricted use to law enforcement,
scientific researchers and certain industries such as construction.</LD>

<LD>Microsoft Corp.'s new Web services computing platform leaves programs
running on it vulnerable to attack because of a flaw in a related
product officially released Thursday, a software evaluation company
said.</LD>
<LD>   The flaw, if left unfixed, could make software built on
Microsoft's Visual Studio.Net open to tampering, according to Garry
McGraw, chief technology officer at Dulles, Va.-based Cigital Inc.
Microsoft held events in San Francisco and Chicago to celebrate the
release of tools for software developers, saying security
enhancements and other features made it ideal for building programs
that deliver services over the Internet. Microsoft is investigating
the claim, a spokesman said.</LD>

<HD>Sobrato Buys Complexes at Near-Record Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trammell Crow Residential said Thursday that it sold two apartment
complexes in the Southland for $126.8 million, transactions that
underscore the strength of the region's housing market.</LD>
<LD>   Alexan City Place, a 214-unit complex in Pasadena, and Alexan Parc
Rose, a 373-unit complex in Oxnard, were purchased by Sobrato
Development Communities, which is branching out from Silicon Valley.
Sobrato paid $56.5 million, or more than $264,000 a unit, for Alexan
City Place, and $70.3 million, or nearly $188,000 a unit, for Alexan
Parc Rose. The prices are believed to be near records for apartments
away from the coast in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</LD>
<LD>   Low vacancies, combined with scant new construction, have kept
rents rising across the Southland, boosting apartment building prices
as well, said Stephen Stein, a regional manager for Marcus &amp;
Millichap in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The deal marks Sobrato's expansion into the Southern California
market, where housing prices have risen at a robust pace.</TE>
<TE>   Sobrato, the largest privately held developer of commercial and
multifamily properties in Silicon Valley, owns more than 5,000
apartment units.</TE>
<TE>   Trammell Crow sold the complexes to provide working capital for
other apartment projects, said Kevin Andrade, a division partner in
the Costa Mesa regional office.</TE>
<TE>   Both Southland complexes, completed in June, have vacancy rates of
about 10%. Although the vacancy rates are much higher than rates
throughout the two counties, the rents are much higher as well,
starting at $1,350 in Oxnard and $1,700 at the Pasadena complex.</TE>

<HD>Psychic Hotline Accused of Caller Scam</HD>
<DH>Courts: FTC says two 'Miss Cleo'-touted firms falsely
promised free readings. Telemarketers deny the allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The brief but flamboyant television career of "Miss Cleo" is coming
to an end, amid charges  that the psychic hotline advertised by the
Caribbean clairvoyant scammed consumers out of millions of dollars
with false promises of free readings.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.,
the Federal Trade Commission accused two telemarketing firms of using
deceptive tactics to lure callers to the hotline, which actually
provides psychic readings at a cost of $4.99 a minute. The Ft.
Lauderdale-based firms, Psychic Readers Network Inc. and Access
Resources Services Inc., used the pseudonymous Miss Cleo in their
nationwide TV ads, infomercials and mailings.</LD>
<LD>   "Considering the laundry list of unfair and deceptive practices in
this case, it's a mystery to us why Miss Cleo and her employers
haven't seen this coming," quipped J. Howard Beales III, director of
the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. Beales said the hotline in
recent years has been the subject of about 2,000 consumer complaints.</LD>
<TE>   Along with the telemarketing firms, the suit filed late Wednesday
named their president, Peter Stolz, and officer Steven Feder. The
complaint seeks an injunction barring future violations of the
Federal Trade Commission Act and the FTC rule governing 900-number
telemarketing services. The agency also is asking the court to order
refunds to consumers and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains.</TE>
<TE>   During the last year, the two firms also have faced enforcement
actions by nine states.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the firms complained that the FTC had refused to
discuss the allegations before filing its complaint, choosing instead
to try the firms in the media. The commission "apparently was
unwilling to allow the truth to compromise a good headline," they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "To say we're being deceptive is just plain wrong and unfair,"
said Stolz, adding that "99.999% [of customers] are happy with the
service."</TE>
<TE>   Ads for the hotline--featuring Miss Cleo's Caribbean-accented
entreaties to "Call me now!"--promise free psychic readings to
callers to an 800 number. Authorities said callers are then directed
to a 900 number, where they are to receive a three-minute reading for
free.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Beales, the three minutes typically run out while
the callers are on hold or being asked routine questions, such as
name and address. Hotline operators, he said, do "whatever it takes
to keep them on the line and keep the meter running"--including lying
about when the free time has ended. According to the FTC lawsuit,
psychic readers "who consistently fail to keep consumers on the line
past the allotted free time are likely to be terminated."</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, Beales said, customers are called with the news
that "Miss Cleo has had a dream about you"--and are urged to call her
right back on the 900 number. "Some consumers have gotten 10 calls a
day, and when consumers say, 'Please don't call me anymore,'
sometimes the marketer has been abusive," Beales said.</TE>
<TE>   Cautioning that the numbers are rough estimates, the FTC said that
as many as 6 million people have called the hotline through the
years, running up average phone charges of $60 apiece--or $360
million total.</TE>
<TE>   "We think a large portion of that is consumer loss," Beales said,
though "there are probably some people who are happy with what they
got."</TE>
<TE>   Stolz told The Times that during the nine years his companies have
operated, phone traffic has been about half the FTC's estimate. He
confirmed that $60 is the approximate average cost per call, but he
denied that consumers are deceived about when they are being charged
for their calls.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the lawsuit, he said, "we're going to show them
with specifics that the things that they think we did, we didn't do."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, the FTC action spells Miss Cleo's retirement
as brand name and spokeswoman for the telemarketing firms.</TE>
<TE>   Miss Cleo's real name reportedly is Youree Dell Harris, but Stolz
would not confirm this. He said she began as one of the hotline's
readers and was anointed  because of her "electric personality ... in
addition to her psychic abilities."</TE>
<TE>   She "knows things about people that there's no way she can know,"
Stolz said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he said, "we're taking her off of the commercials
because she shouldn't really be tarred with the problems the company
is having."</TE>

<HD>Pearle Vision Subject of Lawsuit</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cole National Corp.'s Pearle Vision faces a lawsuit by California's
attorney general that claims the eyeglass retailer engages in the
unlicensed practice of optometry and deceptive marketing.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's office claims Pearle advertises that it
provides optometric services such as eye exams with tag lines such as
"The Doctor Is In." Pearle Vision is prohibited by state law from
providing optometric services.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in San Diego County Superior Court, seeks to end
the allegedly deceptive and misleading sales practices as well as
Pearle Vision's practicing of optometry without a license. It also
seeks refunds for illegally charged eye-dilation fees.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe Pearle Vision is using improper arrangements with
optometrists and deceptive promotions of low-cost eye exams to lure
customers to Pearle Vision stores to boost eyeglass sales," Lockyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   California law bars retail eyeglass sellers from controlling or
subsidizing optometrists to prevent patients from feeling pressured
to purchase eyeglasses, Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   A Cole National spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mayfield Heights, Ohio-based Cole has more than 2,100 optical
stores in the U.S. Cole shares, fell 35 cents to close at $14.20 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Dell Says Earnings Fell, Market Share Rose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No. 1 personal computer maker Dell Computer Corp. on Thursday posted
slightly lower earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter in a weak
corporate market but made more gains against its rivals in the
consumer business.</LD>
<LD>   Dell, which has led an aggressive price war that helped it win
market share from rivals such as Compaq Computer Corp., also said it
expects to outperform the industry in its current quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Dell said it expects industrywide shipments to drop 10% in the
current quarter from the fourth quarter but sees its own volumes
falling by 3% to 5%. Shares of Dell rose to $27.06 in after-hours
trading, up from its close of $26.81 on Nasdaq. The results were
released after the markets closed.</LD>
<TE>   "They beat the numbers on the revenue, and earnings came in line
with the revised upward guidance," said Alan Loewenstein, portfolio
co-manager of the John Hancock Technology Fund. "Dell is taking
market share and, yes, Dell is winning versus Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard and Gateway."</TE>
<TE>   Earnings for the quarter ended Feb. 1 declined 10% to $456
million, or 17 cents a share, from $508 million, or 18 cents, a year
ago, excluding charges. Revenue declined 7% to $8.06 billion even as
consumer demand for Dell PCs grew more than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Dell had raised its fourth-quarter guidance last month to earnings
of 17 cents from 16 cents, on revenue of $8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   For the first quarter, Dell said it expects earnings to meet the
Wall Street consensus of 16 cents and revenue to meet or modestly
beat the estimates of $7.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Dell's outlook is in line with what other technology companies
have been saying about the first quarter. Hewlett-Packard Co., for
instance, said Wednesday that it expects revenue to fall modestly
this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The PC industry had a tough year in 2001, with demand among
consumers and corporations in a slump that worsened as the economic
downturn took hold. During that time, Dell led an aggressive price
war that helped it win substantial market share and unseat Compaq as
the top PC company.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer demand in the fourth quarter was stronger than many PC
makers expected, however, causing Dell rivals to surpass earnings and
revenue expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Other technology sector earnings, excluding one-time items unless
noted:</TE>
<TE>   * Nvidia Corp. said its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings soared 143%
to $75.5 million, or 43 cents a share, beating analysts' expectations
of 31 to 36 cents. Revenue climbed 129% to $500 million. But the
company's disclosure of an internal investigation after a Securities
and Exchange Commission inquiry sent its shares down sharply in
after-hours trade to $57.30 from a Nasdaq close of $62.16.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, however, dismissed concerns about the probe, and focused
on Nvidia's results, which topped even the most optimistic forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company said earnings soared 143% to
$75.5 million, or 43 cents a share. Analysts on average were
expecting 34 cents, with a range of 31 to 36 cents. Revenue climbed
129% to $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   Nvidia, a maker of computer graphics processors and software, said
it was conducting an internal review of the recording of certain
reserves and the timing of certain expense records in its 2000 fourth
quarter and the first three quarters of fiscal 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The review was spurred by an inquiry from the SEC and is related
to the SEC's previously announced investigation of alleged insider
trading by some Nvidia engineers.* Ingram Micro Inc. said net income
in its fiscal fourth quarter tumbled to $5.7 million, or 4 cents a
share, from $57.9 million, or 39 cents, as businesses and consumers
bought fewer personal computers. The computer products distributor
said profit was $14.4 million, or 10 cents a share, 2 cents better
than analysts' forecasts. Sales fell 24% to $6.14 billion. Ingram
also warned that sales and profit will miss Wall Street estimates for
the current quarter.</TE>

<HD>National Golf May Merge With American Golf</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Firms are struggling to overcome industry
slump. Wall Street skeptical of deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica-based National Golf Properties Inc. tentatively agreed
to merge with its financially troubled partner and largest tenant,
American Golf Corp., as both companies struggle to overcome a deep
industry slump.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, which was announced Wednesday night, was met with
skepticism on Wall Street, where some industry analysts raised
concerns about possible conflicts of interest involving National
Golf's chairman and largest shareholder, David G. Price, who also is
head of privately owned American Golf.</LD>
<LD>   Investors are concerned that Price may be using his position at
both companies to gain a better deal for himself at the expense of
National Golf's other shareholders, an analyst said. American Golf
leases and operates the vast majority of the more than 140 golfing
properties owned by National Golf, which is a real estate investment
trust.</LD>
<TE>   National Golf "investors are saying that American Golf is
basically a bankrupt company and why are we paying anything at all
for it," Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Sakwa told Bloomberg News.
"Investors are concerned about the possible conflict of interest in
Price's dual role."</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of National Golf fell 8
cents to close at $6.99.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares have plunged nearly 70% since mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   National Golf provided relatively few details, including the value
of the proposed merger. The firm said the owners of American Golf may
receive preferred stock as part of the transaction, which would
create the world's largest publicly owned golf course company with
about 300 owned and managed properties. The deal, which is subject to
reaching a definitive agreement and other approvals, is scheduled to
close in the second quarter, National Golf said.</TE>
<TE>   "This powerful combination allows National Golf and American Golf
the opportunity to maximize the multiple strengths of all the
combined companies on an international basis with the goal of
creating and growing the finest and most successful golf company in
the world," Price said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials could not be reached for further comment.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the merger plan, National Golf said it would seek a
major new equity investor in the combined company. A major investor,
such as an aggressive opportunity fund, could put a further squeeze
on the company's public shareholders, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bringing in opportunity fund money does not bode well for
shareholders," said Matthew Ostrower, a securities analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. "They require huge returns."</TE>
<TE>   This week, National Golf shareholders were told that the company
had suspended its 46-cents-a-share quarterly dividend in what some
analysts said was a prelude to a combination with American Golf.</TE>

<HD>Richard Cook to Become Disney Studios Chairman</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The media giant picks a longtime employee to
be in charge of the movie operation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER   and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Cook, who began his 31-year career operating the steam train
and monorail at Disneyland and helped build Disney's vaunted
distribution and marketing machine, is being handed the keys to the
Burbank studio's movie kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   Cook is expected to be named today chairman of Walt Disney
Studios, making him one of the most powerful movie executives in
Hollywood. The appointment will end eight months of speculation that
Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner would bring in a
seasoned, high-profile outsider to run the studio.</LD>
<LD>   Although Cook lacks the depth of relationships with top Hollywood
agents, stars, writers and filmmakers that other studio chiefs have,
the affable, low-key 51-year-old has spent his entire career on the
marketing and distribution sides of the movie business, and is well
respected within Disney and by the  board.</LD>
<TE>   He fills the key movie post at Disney left vacant since June's
departure of Peter Schneider, who quit after a difficult 18-month
tenure. Schneider had headed Disney's animation division for years,
but he too was a relative stranger to many of Hollywood's movers and
shakers and had no experience overseeing live-action movies. By
contrast, his predecessor, Joe Roth, who served six years as Disney
Studios chief, was well connected in Hollywood circles.</TE>
<TE>   After Schneider left, Eisner said he would take his time naming  a
replacement. Eisner is known to have talked to a number of top
Hollywood figures as potential candidates, including producer Brian
Grazer ("A Beautiful Mind"). Sources said Eisner was initially
hesitant to give Cook the job because he lacked experience putting
together the creative elements of big movies.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, Eisner tapped one of his own trusted lieutenants,
a quintessential company man who has never worked anywhere else. Cook
has been instrumental in helping build Disney's powerful distribution
and marketing operations, which were in their infancy when he first
joined the studio from Disneyland in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1990s, Cook has been responsible for launching
Disney's "grand-style" movie premieres, including the debut of
"Pocahontas" in Central Park for 110,000 people;  and last year's
"Pearl Harbor" on the John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, who for the last six years has been chairman of Disney's
motion picture group, will now be responsible for the worldwide
production, marketing and distribution of live-action movies for Walt
Disney Pictures, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures. He also will
oversee the marketing and distribution of the studio's animated
movies. He will report to both Eisner and Disney President Robert
Iger. Tom Schumacher, who heads Disney's bedrock feature animation
division, will continue answering to Eisner and Vice Chairman Roy E.
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Since last summer, Eisner has taken a much more hands-on role at
the movie studio, attending story meetings and even giving script
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner has been under pressure from Wall Street to stabilize the
management at Disney, to improve the earnings and bump up a sagging
stock price. In the last year Disney cut 4,000 jobs, and the company
has struggled in many of its key business units, including ABC
television and its movie divisions. A box-office leader for many
years, Disney placed fourth in overall market share last year, behind
rivals Warner Bros., Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures,
according to ACNielsen EDI Inc. Disney also has cut nearly 500 jobs
in its venerable animation film division and expects to cut hundreds
more by the end of next year.</TE>
<TE>   By naming Cook, Eisner might appease those on Wall Street and in
Hollywood who have been critical of the exodus of high level
executives who have left the Disney fold for one reason or another,
including Roth, former studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg and Disney
President Michael Ovitz.</TE>
<TE>   Cook is not expected to make any substantial changes in the kinds
of movies Disney has made in recent years, which tend to be more
moderately budgeted, less high profile and more family-oriented.
Though Disney's World War II drama "Pearl Harbor" grossed $450
million worldwide, it cost around $200 million to produce and market,
and despite its performance was considered a disappointment given the
huge amount of pre-release hype.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner has publicly said he wants to make more "inspirational" and
lower cost family fare like its box office hits "Princess Diaries"
and "Remember the Titans." In recent years, Eisner has mandated more
financial discipline at the studio, slashing overhead by
consolidating operations and jettisoning many producer deals.</TE>
<TE>   Since summer, Cook has been helping to run the day-to-day
operations of Disney's studio, overseeing marketing and distribution,
acquisitions and worldwide home video, while Nina Jacobson has headed
production.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Bakersfield, Cook began his career as a ride operator
at Disneyland in 1970. He rose through the ranks at the theme park,
catching the attention of Disney's then top executive Card Walker,
who asked him to join the studio in 1977 as manager of pay-TV and
nontheatrical releases.</TE>

<HD>Watkins Depicts Fear at Enron</HD>
<DH>Hearings: Vice president says former finance chief Fastow
tried to fire her for the warnings she sounded, but she defends
ex-Chairman Lay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow tried
last fall to fire Vice President Sherron S. Watkins after she
complained about the company's accounting practices to then-Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay, Watkins told a congressional subcommittee Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins--whose warnings to Lay in August accurately predicted the
energy giant's collapse--also told lawmakers that it was "common
knowledge" inside the company that questionable off-the-books
partnerships were enriching Fastow to the detriment of shareholders
but that employees were too frightened to sound alarms.</LD>
<LD>   "The saying around Enron was: 'Heads, Mr. Fastow wins; tails,
Enron loses,'" Watkins said. Later, she added: "It was like an
off-limits topic. You just didn't even want to discuss it around the
water cooler."</LD>
<TE>   In her first appearance on Capitol Hill, the 42-year-old
accountant became the third Enron manager to point the finger at
former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, questioning the
truthfulness of his claims that he was unaware of financial problems
at the Houston-based company.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, less than a
month after restating earnings to account for previously unreported
losses of $586 million from Fastow's partnerships over the previous 4
1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Enron's acting chief executive, Stephen Cooper,
announced Thursday that two executives criticized in an internal
report had been fired. The executives--Chief Accounting Officer
Richard A. Causey and Chief Risk Officer Richard B. Buy--failed to
adequately oversee transactions with the partnerships, said the
report by the special board panel. Causey and Buy each made millions
of dollars by selling Enron stock in late 2000 and early 2001--when,
documents indicate, they knew key partnership deals were on the verge
of collapse and might have to be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee praised Watkins
for courage and integrity in risking her job to speak up last summer,
before Enron's problems became common knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "All America thanks you for what you did," said Rep. Cliff Stearns
(R-Fla.).</TE>
<TE>   In nearly four hours of testimony, Watkins painted a picture of
indifference and intimidation inside the executive offices of the
Houston corporation's glassy towers as signs of trouble mounted.</TE>
<TE>   She also repeatedly defended Lay, saying she did not believe he
was aware of the accounting improprieties or understood their
significance, although she faulted him for not moving faster to get
to the bottom of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my humble opinion that he did not understand the gravity of
the situation the company was in," Watkins said. "I believed--and I
still believe--that Mr. Lay is a man of integrity."</TE>
<TE>   After serving in various finance positions at Enron since 1993,
Watkins began to work for Fastow in June, assisting in corporate
development. Within a month, she said, she uncovered "alarming"
problems with Fastow's off-the-books partnerships, including the LJM
and Raptor entities. By her estimate, the Raptors--which were created
to cover potential Enron investment losses--had lost as much as $700
million. Enron was obliged to cover those losses by issuing stock to
Raptor partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to be common knowledge that Raptor losses were
backstopped by Enron stock," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Skilling resigned unexpectedly Aug. 14, citing
personal reasons, Watkins wrote a memo to Lay, warning that the
company would "implode in a wave of accounting scandals" because of
the partnership structure.</TE>
<TE>   When Fastow learned that Watkins had complained to Lay about the
off-the-books partnerships he controlled, he reacted angrily, she
said. "He wanted to have me fired," Watkins testified. "He wanted to
seize my computer." She said Fastow's reaction alarmed both Lay and
Cindy Olson, vice president for human resources.</TE>
<TE>   To appease Fastow's demand for Watkins' computer, Olson gave
Watkins a new laptop and suggested that she transfer files from her
old computer and delete any files she did not want seen. Watkins said
Olson told her, "We'll just hand him the hardware."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins also was transferred from Fastow's department to work in
the human resources department, where she helped draft a crisis
management plan last fall that called for Lay to target Fastow and
Skilling for the company's woes.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Fastow did not return a phone call Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins testified that she knew of at least 12 other Enron
employees who expressed concerns in a companywide survey in August
about Enron's questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Although Watkins did not directly accuse Skilling of lying, she
said his testimony last week was "not the whole truth." She said it
was not possible that Skilling was unaware of Enron's problems or the
details of the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling's attorney, Bruce Hiler, refuted Watkins' claims.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything Ms. Watkins said about my client is based either on
hearsay, rumor or opinion," Hiler said. "She did not talk to my
client. She has no basis in fact for her views. While Ms. Watkins is
entitled to her opinions, she is not entitled to her own facts."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the hearing, Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) told
Watkins: "What you have done is really very courageous. You're a
hero. But ... I have a feeling this is just the beginning of a
process for you in terms of the stress you're going to be under."</TE>
<TE>   In other developments:</TE>
<TE>   * Attorneys for laid-off Enron workers said the U.S. trustee
overseeing the bankruptcy, Carolyn Schwartz, agreed to workers'
request that they be permitted to form an official committee in the
case. That will give workers the ability to be heard separate from
the main creditors' committee, which is largely made up of
institutions.</TE>
<TE>   * The main author of the company's internal report on its
financial dealings resigned from Enron's board. William C. Powers,
dean of the University of Texas Law School, was appointed to the
panel about four months ago to head the review.</TE>
<TE>   "My role in this process has been completed," Powers said.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing to Leave Beverly Hills</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The employees still there will be moved to offices
in El Segundo and Woodland Hills. The chairman, CFO will stay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN  and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three weeks after filing the fifth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S.
history, Global Crossing Ltd. is expected to announce as soon as
today that it will vacate its tony executive offices in Beverly
Hills, according to employees briefed on the decision.</LD>
<LD>   Since millionaire investment manager Gary Winnick founded the
telecommunications company in 1997, its opulent offices in the heart
of Beverly Hills have been symbolic of the company's grand vision to
build a worldwide undersea fiber-optic network. They have been a
source of personal pride for Winnick, who directed the building's
vast renovation.</LD>
<LD>   Even as the bulk of Global Crossing's employees and executive
staff have migrated to the East Coast, Winnick has maintained the
Beverly Hills address, where his personal office is a replica of the
White House's Oval Office, and the furniture is worthy of a five-star
hotel.</LD>
<TE>   The company's official headquarters is in Hamilton, Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   The about 60 employees who currently work in Beverly Hills will be
shifted to vacant office space Global Crossing currently leases in El
Segundo and Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The move will save the financially struggling company about
$400,000 a month in rent, according to the most recent figures filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   It also will rid the company of an uncomfortable conflict of
interest. The building is owned by Winnick's investment firm, Pacific
Capital Group. Global Crossing actually pays its rent to North
Crescent Realty V, which is managed by Pacific Capital.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, the company's chairman, and Dan Cohrs, the chief
financial officer, are the only top executives who have remained in
Beverly Hills, in a building shared with Pacific Capital.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick and Cohrs intend to stay, according to a Global Crossing
employee.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive John Legere maintains an office in Beverly Hills,
but spends most of his time in the company's Madison, N.J., offices.
It is unclear what will happen to employees of Asia Global Crossing,
a subsidiary with about 35 employees at the site.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to close the office is not seen as a precursor to
additional layoffs in Beverly Hills, where the staff has already
shrunk dramatically, the employee said. At its height, the office
accommodated about 250 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Employees throughout the company are bracing for another round of
payroll cuts to help trim expenses. Executives have signaled that
more cuts are on the way.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills office, an ornate building modeled after an
Italian villa, has already been scaled back in recent months as the
telecom firm drifted toward bankruptcy. The company-subsidized
cafeteria, known for preparing lavish meals, was closed before
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors the company would leave Beverly Hills have been circulating
at least since then, insiders say. The decision to vacate may have
been accelerated by the Jan. 28 bankruptcy protection filing.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Capital paid $41.5 million to purchase the ornate former
MCA building and installed its name in gold on the green metal gates.</TE>

<HD>Waving the Flag Over U.S. Produce</HD>
<DH>Food: Bills to require labeling by country of origin could
spark a trade war, some fear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patriotism and concerns over food safety in the wake of Sept. 11 have
revived long-stalled legislation that would require supermarkets to
identify the country of origin of produce and possibly meat and fish
as well.</LD>
<LD>   California fruit and vegetable farmers hope the requirement will
help them battle imports. But importers say the measure is
protectionist and that it could spark a trade war with other
countries.</LD>
<LD>   The requirement is buried in both House and Senate versions of a
major farm bill that extends federal agricultural support programs.
Both versions have been approved and are headed to conference
committee.</LD>
<TE>   Both provisions would require signs on display cases or stamps or
stickers on fruits and vegetables identifying their country of
origin. The Senate version also would require labels on beef, lamb,
pork, fish and peanuts.</TE>
<TE>   Farm groups say these labels will help consumers make informed
choices about the products they're buying.</TE>
<TE>   And, they say, the labels could persuade shoppers to pay more for
U.S. products. That would help farmers--especially California's
struggling fruit and vegetable growers--cover rising production
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Our producers endure a number of costs with regard to regulation
that other countries aren't required to abide by," said Lisa Dillabo,
director of international trade and plant health for the California
Farm Bureau. "These give consumers confidence in the food supply."
Many consumers, she said, have shown that they are willing to pay
more for what they feel is added protection.</TE>
<TE>   Importers, however, say the measure amounts to a protectionist
trade barrier designed to position domestic goods as safer products,
even if they're not.</TE>
<TE>   One thing's for sure, analysts say. The long-stalled measure's
recent success is owing to its link--however tenuous--to efforts to
combat bio-terrorism and ensure food safety.</TE>
<TE>   "With the threat of bio-terrorism becoming an increasing worry on
consumers' minds, country-of-origin labeling is becoming more
important," said Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), who introduced a
country-of-origin bill in the late 1980s when he served in the House.
Such labeling would help in segregating infected food in case of an
outbreak in another country, he says.</TE>
<TE>   House measure sponsor Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs), who
represents table grape growers, says it will give producers the
ability to "market their produce and tout why domestically grown
produce is better."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of promotion could create trade tensions, experts say,
and encourage poor treatment for U.S. produce in export markets,
where U.S. fruit already is labeled.</TE>
<TE>   "This has the potential for backfiring on the U.S.," says Gary
Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics
in Washington. "If the U.S. does it, other countries could say that's
a green light for us to do it too," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers, the measure's biggest critics, say the regulation is no
guarantee of safety and would be costly and difficult to manage.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all of the responsibility and the liability and I don't
think we should," said John Motley of the Food Marketing Institute, a
group that represents retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, retailers say, many of the country's largest shippers are
already voluntarily labeling produce in an effort to boost sales,
including apple growers from Washington state, navel orange growers
from California and potato shippers from Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, several states, including California, have launched
promotional campaigns to advertise the benefits of locally grown
produce.</TE>
<TE>   Mandates to label the origin of products exist in only a few
states, including Florida, which adopted the regulation for all
produce in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Although widely praised by the state's growers, the regulation has
done little to boost the market share of American produce in the
state, according to Florida agriculture industry officials.</TE>
<TE>   And given that, many importers don't believe the regulation will
hurt sales of imported produce.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will change the playing field at all," said
grower and importer Bruce Taylor, chief executive of Taylor Farms in
Salinas. "If you have great-looking product from Canada next to
product that doesn't look as good from the U.S., [consumers] will buy
the product from Canada."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers, however, do seem to support labeling. A phone survey of
1,000 households by a produce industry newspaper, the Packer, found
that 78% favored mandatory country-of-origin labeling.</TE>
<TE>   In that survey, 90% of consumers surveyed believed labels also
should list the chemicals used in production of those products.</TE>
<TE>   And that's what has some farmers and lawmakers concerned. Although
country-of-origin labeling could give their products an edge in
supermarkets, they say, it could also lead to more regulation, such
as mandatory listing of pesticides, fertilizers and coatings such as
wax used on produce.</TE>
<TE>   Fruit and vegetables are the only items that would have to be
labeled under the House version of the farm bill.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Senate measure was broadened to mandate labels on
meat, fish and peanuts to pick up the votes of lawmakers representing
states with big interests in these sectors.</TE>
<TE>   These two versions still have to be reconciled and could face some
opposition from President Bush.</TE>

<HD>Disney's in the 'Tween' Crowd With Lizzie</HD>
<DH>Marketing: The media giant is targeting its cross promotion
of the hit show at the lucrative market of kids 8 to 14.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lizzie McGuire is an awkward 13-year-old kid just trying to survive
the seventh grade, but for Walt Disney Co. she's pure gold.</LD>
<LD>   An obscure cable TV character on the Disney Channel a year ago,
Lizzie McGuire is suddenly a valuable franchise for Disney, one that
the entertainment giant is aggressively marketing to the lucrative
"tween" market of children between the ages of 8 and 14.</LD>
<LD>   Disney is in a frenzy of cross promotion for the hit cable show
and this week unveiled a Lizzie McGuire fashion doll and gift line at
a toy fair in New York; its publishing arm is releasing two Lizzie
McGuire novels in April, to be followed by a book series. Lizzie
already is featured on 50 million packages of Oscar Mayer Lunchables
in grocery shelves. And in spring 2003, 14-year-old actress Hilary
Duff, who stars in the TV show, will take to the big screen in a
Lizzie McGuire feature film.</LD>
<TE>   Disney is fiercely competing with other media conglomerates for
the tween market by spinning movies out of hit television shows.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon and Paramount studios already have
scored big with "Rugrats" and "Jimmy Neutron" feature films after the
characters first appeared on cable TV. And AOL Time Warner Inc. is
leveraging its popular "Powerpuff Girls" and "Scooby-Doo" shows on
Cartoon Network with upcoming feature films.</TE>
<TE>   "We're creating a franchise," said Rich Ross, the new president of
entertainment of the Disney Channel. "What 'Rugrats' has done for
Nickelodeon ... 'Lizzie McGuire' has done for us."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is trying to find their way into that [tween] market,"
said Ira Mayer, publisher of the Entertainment Marketing Letter in
New York. "People are trying to get to these kids to build a
relationship with different properties so they can build on their
brands."</TE>
<TE>   Children age 8 to 14 account for about 25 million consumers in the
U.S. who will spend more than $30 billion on all manner of goods in
2002, analysts say. That's why a whole range of companies, from
wireless carriers to clothing manufacturers, are jumping into the
tween market.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has previously developed direct-to-video and merchandise
spinoffs from television shows, such as the "Bear in the Big Blue
House" and "Rolie Polie Olie" targeted to preschoolers. Not since the
1950s had Disney launched a feature film based on a live-action
television character.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking to develop merchandising around characters that
really strike a chord among consumers," said Andy Mooney, head of
Disney's consumer products division. "If you look at the last five to
10 years, the properties that have emerged in the marketplace ...
have come predominantly from the world of TV or from publishing."</TE>
<TE>   The 18-year-old Disney Channel, which has 79 million subscribers,
has traditionally catered to younger children. But over the last four
years the channel has made inroads into the tween market with such
series as "Bug Juice," a reality show based on a summer camp, and the
animated sitcom "The Proud Family." In the fourth quarter, Disney's
"The Proud Family," "Lizzie McGuire" and Nickelodeon's "Fairly Odd
Parents" tied for the highest-rated tween program  on basic cable TV,
according to Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   But overall, the Disney Channel placed a distant third in January,
with an average of 951,000 viewers, well behind Nickelodeon, which
had 1.7 million viewers, and Cartoon Network with 1.3 million,
according to Nielsen.</TE>
<TE>   The "Lizzie McGuire" show, created by Terri Minsky and produced by
Susan Jansen, premiered in January 2001 on the Disney Channel and
joined ABC's Saturday morning lineup in September.</TE>
<TE>   The show quickly became one of the top-rated kids shows on basic
cable, drawing 24.9 million viewers in November from airings on the
Disney Channel and ABC.</TE>
<TE>   The comedy-drama details the pre-adolescent adventures of a
blond-haired girl and her relationship with her brother and parents.
Lizzie also has an cartoon alter ego who pops up on screen and gives
her advice.</TE>
<TE>   To further leverage the character, Disney recently signed a
four-year licensing deal with Los Angeles-based Applause, which has
created a new line of Lizzie toys and gifts, from dolls to key chains
and frame pillows. An undisclosed retailer will debut a Lizzie
clothing line in August.</TE>

<LD>Software company Raining Data Corp. on Thursday said it will revise
its financial results downward for six quarters to reflect accounting
errors related to the Irvine company's acquisition of a company and
certain software in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The revisions will lower the company's revenue by about $2 million
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, and the six months ended
Sept. 30.</LD>
<LD>   Raining Data, which originally logged revenue of $21.89 million

<HD>Woman Held in Theft of Insurance Settlement</HD>
<DH>Crime: A former lawyer allegedly stole $380,000 from two
brothers, who were later killed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Beverly Hills attorney was arrested Thursday on suspicion of
stealing a $380,000 life insurance settlement from two Inglewood
brothers who were shot and killed while awaiting that settlement from
their mother's estate, Inglewood police said.</LD>
<LD>   Angela Wallace, 41, was booked at Twin Towers Correctional
Facility Thursday in lieu of $380,000 bail on suspicion of grand
theft.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Wallace had received a two-year suspension from the
California State Bar in 1999, and was still barred from practicing
law when she represented herself as an attorney to Jontrae Byrdsong,
18, and his brother Howard Byrdsong, 20.</LD>
<TE>   Inglewood Police Det. Jeff Steinhoff said Wallace agreed to act as
a trustee for the pair, whose mother, Los Angeles Police Officer
Shiree Arrant, died of natural causes in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance company sent Wallace a check, which she deposited
into the older brother's account, but the money later disappeared,
Steinhoff said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Byrdsongs never knew they had the money. They were not aware
it had been deposited into the account until after it had
disappeared," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the death of Arrant, the Byrdsong brothers had moved in with
family friends Garrette and Regina Martin on a middle-class street in
Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   On June 6, 2001, a man dressed as a postal worker knocked on the
door, pistol-whipped Martin, and shot and killed both brothers.</TE>
<TE>   The killer has not been found.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood detectives declined to say whether Wallace is suspected
in connection with the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, a graduate of USC Law School, got her license to practice
in California in 1988. In September 1999, she received the two-year
suspension and was placed on five years' probation after agreeing to
seven counts of misconduct in six cases, according to State Bar of
California records.</TE>
<TE>   The State Bar Court had found that Wallace "commingled funds,
allowed the misappropriation of client funds, and committed acts of
moral turpitude," according to the California Bar Journal, the state
bar's official publication.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace resigned from the State Bar with charges pending against
her in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Her arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior
Court.</TE>

<HD>County Firefighter Accused of Arson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County Fire Department public information officer and
his wife were charged with arson Thursday for allegedly setting
ablaze an unoccupied Pasadena house last summer after their attempt
to buy it failed.</LD>
<LD>   Roland Lee Sprewell, 37, was arrested by the San Gabriel Valley
Arson Explosives Task Force for allegedly lighting a fire that
severely damaged the house at 1541 N. Raymond Ave., Jane Robison, a
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said.</LD>
<LD>   Heidi Sprewell, 36, was charged with one count of arson related to
the fire on July 26, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that the Altadena couple set the fire after a
bank refused to return a deposit on the home that they had tried to
buy.</TE>
<TE>   "They ran into difficulties buying the house and lost their
deposit," Robison said.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell, a county fire inspector, was booked in County Jail on
Thursday and held in lieu of $50,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to be arraigned today in Pasadena Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Robison said Heidi Sprewell is scheduled to surrender to
prosecutors this morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all shocked," said Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really caught in the middle here because we think the world
of Roland."</TE>
<TE>   "As firefighters we have a great aversion to any kind of arson,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   "He has always distinguished himself as a very conscientious
professional. We certainly hope he's not guilty." Sprewell has been a
county firefighter for seven years, appearing regularly in newspaper
stories and television interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Battalion Chief Joe Nestor said that after Pasadena arson
investigators established that the fire had been deliberately set and
that Sprewell may have been involved, the department referred the
matter to the arson task force.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a firefighter with this department [before], so [it] was
decided the Alhambra-based task force should investigate it," Nestor
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alhambra arson investigators and agents with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms make up the joint task force that
investigated the alleged arson.</TE>

<HD>Neighbor Arrested in Death of Dog</HD>
<DH>Crime: Thousand Oaks resident who complained of barking is
accused of firing pellet gun at the beagle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deputies arrested a Thousand Oaks man on suspicion of killing a
neighbor's beagle with a pellet gun because the dog's constant
barking annoyed him.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald Thieman, 37, was booked into Ventura County Jail Thursday
on accusations of felony cruelty to an animal. He remains jailed in
lieu of $15,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old beagle belonged to a family who lives across the
street from Thieman.</LD>
<TE>   "It's rough," said the dog's owner, Perry Harding, 47. "It's just
like losing a member of the family. There's anger, and there's
grief."</TE>
<TE>   Harding said two of his three sons were home alone Feb. 5 when
they heard the dog yelping in the backyard. When they opened the door
to let her inside, she ran under a bed and hid. "They said she
wouldn't come out--not even for a dog treat," Harding said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Harding returned from work that afternoon, the dog had
died.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, we had no idea what had really happened to her," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Harding found what appeared to be a bullet hole near the
dog's chest, and a veterinarian confirmed the animal had been shot,
apparently with a pellet gun.</TE>
<TE>   The veterinarian took X-rays, which showed the dog had been shot
at least three other times with lead pellets, which are fired from
air-powered rifles or pistols.</TE>
<TE>   The family suspected the dog had been injured earlier, but did not
know she had ever been shot, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Thieman was arrested Thursday morning after a weeklong
investigation into the dog's death, said Ventura County Sheriff's
Det. Kevin Vaden, who added that Thieman admitted that he had shot
the dog before. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura County
Superior Court on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although Thieman told deputies he had been bothered for several
months by the dog's barking, he never reported the nuisance to the
city or animal control officers, Vaden said.</TE>
<TE>   Harding said Thieman and another neighbor had once approached the
family about the dog's frequent barking.</TE>
<TE>   "What she would do is get on her own scent trail and follow it,
and bark, bark, bark, bark," Harding said. "That's what beagles do."</TE>
<TE>   Harding said he tried using special collars to control the
barking, but those did not work. So the family decided to keep the
dog inside while they were out of the house during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Vaden said whether the family tried to control the dog's barking
is irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other ways to handle a problem dog," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Jenks, director of the Ventura County Department of Animal
Regulations, said such cruelty toward an animal is never justified.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand, on the one hand, a person's frustration with
listening to a barking dog all day--it can really send a person over
the edge," Jenks said. "But there are legal, humane remedies to
barking dogs that don't have to include killing one with a pellet
gun."</TE>
<TE>   Harding said his family will miss the puppy that would greet them
at the door when they came home and keep their feet warm at the foot
of their beds at night.</TE>
<TE>   Harding said the neighborhood's outpouring of support has helped.
One family brought over a sympathy card and two stuffed toy beagles.</TE>

<HD>Governor Hopefuls Keep On Debating</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The top GOP rivals clash from afar amid signs
that Riordan's lead might be narrowing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid signs their race is tightening, the three major Republican
candidates for governor debated at long distance Thursday, scrapping
over Enron, electability and which of them is truest to the Grand Old
Party.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Riordan, stumping in the San Fernando Valley, canceled a
long-planned ski trip to spend more time campaigning--an indication
of nervousness in the frontrunner's camp.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Simon Jr. bestowed a new fitness center on East Los Angeles'
Garfield High--thanks to his family's charitable trust--and then
traveled to Orange County and Palm Springs, where he stepped up
attacks on his two main GOP rivals.</LD>
<TE>   Bill Jones held a news conference in Sacramento, lumping Riordan
and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis together under the Enron umbrella.
Jones' strategists, meantime, readied a last-ditch TV campaign, the
first paid advertising of the secretary of state's cash-strapped
effort.</TE>
<TE>   While the Republicans fanned out from Long Beach, site of
Wednesday night's third and final debate, the man each hopes to face
in November was addressing a Sacramento youth forum and defending his
acceptance of Enron campaign cash.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody in America fought the energy companies, including Enron,
harder than I did," said Davis, who accepted $119,500 from the energy
giant before its sudden collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a reporter afterward to comment on Wednesday night's
debate, the governor declined.</TE>
<TE>   But most analysts agreed: After roughly three hours on the same
stage--sparring over abortion, taxes, gay marriage and even whether
spouses are fair political game--the Republicans emerged from their
series of debates with former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan still the
candidate to beat.</TE>
<TE>   For that, the Riordan camp was grateful, especially given the
candidate's penchant for gaffes and inopportune asides on the
campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon, a Pacific Palisades businessman making his first run
for office, seemingly performed well enough to pull himself into
contention--particularly if the turnout on March 5 draws heavily from
the party's most ideological voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds would seem to favor a Riordan win," said Jack Pitney, a
Republican analyst who teaches politics at Claremont McKenna
University. "But weird things can happen in a low-turnout primary."</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Pitney said, "the people who show up are the most
motivated in the Republican Party. They tend to be the most
conservative and they're the ones who've favored Simon."</TE>
<TE>   But Jones hopes to shake their allegiance to Simon with an ad
campaign he aims to launch Monday. Acknowledging the steep odds, one
strategist said, "We've got a rifle and we've got one bullet. While
there is a chance to win this thing, we've got to be dead on."</TE>
<TE>   The ad, filmed this week, features former Republican Gov. George
Deukmejian criticizing Riordan's longtime support of Democratic
campaigns and causes--a theme Jones pressed Thursday at his
Sacramento news conference.</TE>
<TE>   He defended his criticism during the debate of Riordan's wife,
Nancy Daly Riordan, for giving thousands of dollars to Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend, Maryland's Democratic lieutenant governor. "If Dick
Riordan cannot convince his wife to be a Republican, how can he
convince anyone else to be a Republican?" Jones asked.</TE>
<TE>   He renewed his criticism of Riordan and Davis for accepting past
donations from Enron, and for meeting with its ex-chairman, Kenneth
Lay. The Enron debacle is "about the power companies and the power
brokers, It's about trust and integrity--and the lack thereof," Jones
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be able to go after Davis on energy. I can. Dick
Riordan cannot."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part Thursday, the former mayor ignored Jones'
attacks, much as he has throughout the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a breakfast of the San Fernando Valley Lincoln Club, a
group of GOP moderates, Riordan focused on Davis and his aggressive
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a governor, Gray Davis, who seems to think the only
thing you have to do as governor is to raise money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He accused Davis of "looking at polls" rather than handling
California's problems with transportation, housing, health care and
the economy. "You have 1 million unemployed in the state, and yet you
have a governor and a Legislature that's the enemy of business," he
said, broadening his partisan criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan had planned to leave Thursday for four days at his
vacation home in Sun Valley, an Idaho ski resort, after a 10-day
stretch in late January and early February when he made no public
appearances in California. But he abruptly canceled those plans and
scheduled a series of campaign stops, including one today in Thousand
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a campaign, and a candidate's schedule is always in flux,"
spokeswoman Kim Serafin said. Simon started Thursday at Garfield High
School, where he attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new fitness
center that was funded by his family's charitable foundation. The
candidate told students that the program is based on an ancient Greek
theory of "sound body, sound mind"--a phrase he repeated in Latin.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was off to a lunch meeting of the Orange County chapter of
the Brigham Young University management society.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the conservative Republican in the race, and that's because
I'm someone who believes in traditional values," Simon said, citing
his involvement in launching the family-friendly channel PAX-TV.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the race, Simon has been loath to criticize his
opponents--particularly Riordan, a personal friend. But as the gap in
the polls has narrowed, Simon has been increasingly willing to take
his rivals to task, a pattern that continued Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, he salted his standard campaign speech with
attacks on Riordan and Jones. He accused Jones, a former GOP Assembly
leader, of shepherding the largest tax hike in California history
through the Legislature in 1991. That was a measure meant to help
close a $14-billion deficit the state faced.</TE>
<TE>   And Riordan, Simon said, "has made statements that he is open to
an Internet sales tax, hostile to Proposition 13, and that
Californians are under-taxed."</TE>
<TE>   He also took a swipe at Riordan's refusal to detail how he would
handle the state's $12-billion budget deficit until after the
primary. "I think voters are entitled to make an informed decision,"
Simon said.</TE>

<DH>Search: The hunt continues for girl, 7, missing for two
weeks. 'It gets harder each day,' her mother says.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Two weeks after vanishing from her bedroom in an upscale
neighborhood, 7-year-old Danielle van Dam is still missing and police
say they are not close to an arrest.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, between appearances on national television shows,
Brenda and Damon van Dam met with reporters camped in front of their
Sabre Springs home and made another emotional appeal for the return
of their daughter.</LD>
<LD>   "It gets harder each day," said Brenda van Dam, her voice
breaking. "But I have to keep hope that she's alive and will come
home. It's so hard for me to know that someone knows where my
daughter is and it's not me. It's killing me."</LD>
<TE>   Police have been investigating one of the Van Dams' neighbors,
David Westerfield, 49, a self-employed engineer, whose home two doors
away was searched Wednesday night for the third time. Westerfield has
not been charged.</TE>
<TE>   "We are focusing a lot of resources on this area [Westerfield],"
Lt. Jim Collins said. "Obviously, we wouldn't do this if we thought
it was a wild goose chase."</TE>
<TE>   Police have taken a DNA sample from Westerfield. His recreational
vehicle--which he drove to the Imperial Valley desert on the day
Danielle disappeared--was impounded and examined by forensic experts.</TE>
<TE>   Police said later that Westerfield had cleaned the vehicle before
it was seized, and that they have searched the desert for clues
without success. Damon van Dam said he plans to do his own search in
the area today.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, who lives alone, has retained one of the city's top
criminal defense attorneys. Watched 24 hours a day by reporters and
plainclothes police officers, Westerfield leaves his home only
occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Wes Hill, a friend from Utah, arrived to show his
support for Westerfield.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he's innocent. He's a big puppy dog," Hill said. "He
wouldn't hurt anyone. He's especially upset because it involves a
child."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the search for Danielle continued in numerous ways,
including a Web site and a toll-free phone line, and with the help of
a bloodhound on loan from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.
Hundreds of neighbors have been combing the brushy hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Dams have posted a $25,000 reward for information leading
to the girl's return. A bail bondsman has offered $50,000 and a
retired telephone company owner $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   And there has been widespread media attention. When the case was
featured on television's "America's Most Wanted" last weekend, police
received tips about numerous "sightings" of the girl, but none bore
fruit. Psychics called to offer their assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the girl's disappearance, police had interviewed
sex offenders who live in the neighborhood, searched dozens of
neighbors' homes and arranged for the Van Dams to take a lie-detector
test. After the tests, police said the parents are not suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Four public relations specialists from the San Diego office of
Fleishman-Hillard Inc. offered free advice to the Van Dams on how to
handle the media horde and still keep the story alive, in hopes that
might help bring Danielle home.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to help muster the troops," said Lynn Rubenson of
Fleishman-Hillard. "Danielle got a lot of coverage the first week,
but then comes the Olympics, campaign finance reform, Daniel Pearl,
and Danielle no longer is the top story. We're here to keep Danielle
at the forefront."</TE>
<TE>   John Walsh, host of "America's Most Wanted," and Marc Klaas, whose
daughter, Polly, was abducted and murdered in 1993, have offered
solace to the Van Dams and advice and encouragement on maintaining
the search effort.</TE>
<TE>   With the media attention have come questions about the Van Dams'
lifestyle. They were asked by CNN talk show host Larry King whether
they are "swingers" who may have brought strangers into their home.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Dams' response, repeated for local reporters, has been
calm and unvarying: The focus of the case should remain on finding
Danielle and not on rumors about their private lives, they said. On
the night her daughter disappeared, Brenda van Dam said she was at a
local bar with friends and Damon was home with Danielle and the
couple's two sons.</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam said he put Danielle to bed around 10:30 p.m. At
about 2 a.m., according to Brenda van Dam, she returned home with
four friends. Her husband joined them for pizza, she said.</TE>
<TE>   About 9 a.m. Feb. 2, the Van Dams have said, they discovered
Danielle missing and called police. They told investigators they
found a sliding glass door in the family room and a side door to the
garage were open. "Our home had been breached," said Damon van Dam.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they interviewed the friends who accompanied Brenda
van Dam home that night and concluded that they were not involved in
Danielle's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield was at the same bar that night but was not among those
who accompanied Brenda van Dam home, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Dams have said that they barely know Westerfield and that
he had never been invited to their home. They said Danielle sold Girl
Scout cookies to Westerfield in the days before her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam is a software engineer employed by a firm under
contract to Qualcomm. Brenda is a stay-at-home mother involved in
Girl Scouts and youth sports.</TE>

<HD>Acclaimed After-School Effort Continues Expansion</HD>
<DH>LAUSD: The LA's BEST program is now offered at 101 of the
district's 322 elementary schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fulfilling a pledge he made early in his administration, Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn announced Thursday that city officials and
business leaders have expanded a nationally acclaimed after-school
program to 101 elementary schools in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Since August, 23 more schools have added classes run by LA's BEST,
a public-private partnership that offers tutoring and enrichment
programs between 3 and 6 p.m. school days.</LD>
<LD>   The schools selected are in low-income communities where a large
percentage of the students qualify for federal lunch programs and
have low test scores.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to do everything we can for you today so your tomorrows
can be bright," Hahn told about 50 third-graders Thursday morning
seated on benches in the quad of Arminita Elementary School in North
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the expansion was paid for by philanthropist Eli Broad,
whose foundation donated $1.73 million over three years.</TE>
<TE>   Broad helped raise another $1.1 million in donations to pay for
the new programs.</TE>
<TE>   The city contributed money from federal Community Development
Block Grants.</TE>
<TE>   Broad announced Thursday that he is committed to help expand the
program to another 20 schools. He did not specify how much money he
would give.</TE>
<TE>   Broad called LA's BEST "a proven winner" that provides academic
enrichment and extracurricular activities while keeping children in a
safe environment.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said during last year's mayoral campaign that he wants to
expand the program to every elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of the city's 322 elementary schools participate
in LA's BEST, which serves 17,000 children.</TE>

<HD>Mother Avoids Prison in Heat Deaths of 2 Sons Left in Auto</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley: Judge orders probation after husband's pleas
for leniency. Woman, now in treatment, had pleaded no contest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After tearful pleas for leniency by her husband, a 40-year-old Simi
Valley mother was sentenced to probation Thursday for leaving her two
young sons in a sweltering minivan where they died last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Marlene Heath had faced up to 12 years in prison after pleading no
contest last fall in the Aug. 4 deaths of her sons, 3-year-old Jake
and his 13-month-old brother Dylan.</LD>
<LD>   Heath told police that she drank a bottle of wine, fell asleep in
her bedroom and found the children strapped in their car seats four
hours later.</LD>
<TE>   During her sentencing hearing Thursday, Phillip Heath, the
defendant's husband, pleaded for mercy before Superior Court Judge
Bruce A. Clark. Heath struggled to maintain his composure as he
described his wife as a loving mother and spouse who had long fought
to overcome alcoholism.</TE>
<TE>   "No father could have loved his two children like I loved my two
boys," Heath said. "Marlene was there 24 hours a day, seven days a
week." But prosecutor Susan Aramesh demanded that the judge send a
strong message to other parents of young children, saying that
Heath's actions directly led to the deaths of her children.</TE>
<TE>   "The two victims are not here," Aramesh told Clark. "It's them who
died from the heat. They could not get help from anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the prosecutor's description of the "torturous death"
inflicted on the two young children by their mother, the judge
decided that a prison sentence was not in order.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said he was swayed by defense statements submitted to the
court describing Heath as a near-desperate alcoholic who had managed
to emerge from an abyss of binge-drinking and blackouts since her
sons' deaths to start leading a productive life.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the judge said, setting her free on probation "was one of
the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. What thinking person
would ever lock her children in her car?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tragic situation," Clark said as a packed courtroom waited
for his ruling. "But it would not be a furtherance of justice to send
her to prison."</TE>
<TE>   His announcement was met with a loud chorus of cheers and applause
from those in the gallery as well as many of the jailhouse defendants
awaiting their hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Heath was ordered back to court Feb. 21 to learn the specific
terms of her probation.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Phillip Heath said Clark's ruling was correct and his
two sons "are up in heaven right now jumping up and down."</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a black business suit and white blouse, Marlene Heath
embraced her husband and several friends before leaving the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   She was surrounded by nearly a dozen supporters as she left the
courthouse with her head down.</TE>
<TE>   Heath, who is now a full-time resident at a Ventura drug and
alcohol treatment facility, declined to comment before being led away
to a waiting van.</TE>
<TE>   According to a search warrant affidavit, Heath told police that
she purchased four bottles of wine on Aug. 3 and later drank one or
two bottles.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, she began drinking again, consuming one bottle
of wine.</TE>
<TE>   Heath, a Kinko's employee, left for a company picnic in Ventura
about 1 p.m., but turned back. She estimated she pulled into the
driveway of her Ralston Avenue home about 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavit, she left the boys strapped in their
child safety seats with the windows rolled up and went into the house
to use the bathroom. She told investigators she remembers unlocking
the door, but nothing after that.</TE>
<TE>   Heath found her children dead inside the minivan four hours later.
The two boys died of hyperthermia.</TE>

<DH>Court: Prosecutors in case against rape suspect Andrew
Luster say defense statements could taint the jury pool.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutors are seeking a gag order in the case
against rape suspect Andrew Luster, saying recent out-of-court
statements by defense attorneys could taint the jury pool.</LD>
<LD>   The request comes after Luster's lawyers accused police and
prosecutors of withholding evidence they contend will exonerate their
millionaire client.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Roger Jon Diamond said after a Jan. 31 hearing that
something "bizarre" was occurring and that defense attorneys intended
to get to the bottom of it. Eight days later, Deputy Dist. Attys.
Anthony Wold and Ernesto Acosta filed a motion requesting a gag order
to prohibit prosecutors, defense lawyers, witnesses and investigators
from commenting on the case.</LD>
<TE>   In their motion, Wold and Acosta accused the defense of engaging
in improper pretrial publicity in violation of state rules governing
lawyers' conduct. They argued that unfounded statements on alleged
police corruption could taint the jury pool and force the case to be
moved outside Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   This week Diamond defended his earlier remarks and said he intends
to fight any attempt to prevent the defense from speaking publicly
about the case. "I just think that is improper," he said. Diamond
said his comments did not violate state rules because they were made
in response to earlier statements by officials with the Ventura
County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond and co-counsel Richard G. Sherman argued in a separate
motion that police and prosecutors misled the media through news
releases, which they want turned over to the defense.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers are seeking about 160 additional items, including
crime-scene photographs, which they contend have been withheld.
Luster, 38, great-grandson of cosmetics mogul Max Factor, is accused
of sexually assaulting three women after rendering them unconscious
with a date-rape drug known as gamma hydroxybutrate, or GHB. He was
arrested in July 2000 after one of the women reported being raped.
Investigators later found videotapes of sexual encounters with two
other women.</TE>

<LD>Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said he will vote next month in favor of
converting the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a public
park instead of the airport envisioned by county authorities.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very important for people to decide the quality-of-life
issue of whether there should be an airport in the heart of our
county," he said Thursday during an interview with an anti-airport
Web site.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas said his vote was personal and not an endorsement of
Measure W, which will be on the March 5 primary ballot.</LD>
<TE>   He is being challenged for reelection on the same ballot by Deputy
Dist. Atty. Wally Wade, who has courted anti-airport forces.</TE>

<HD>Ocean Tracts May Be Saved From Drilling</HD>
<DH>Oil: Proposal would pay major firms billions in incentives
to swap exploration rights from California to Louisiana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. senators from California and Louisiana introduced a bill
Thursday offering billions of dollars in incentives to oil companies
if they swap their drilling claims in California waters for those in
the Gulf of Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, co-sponsored by Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer
and Dianne Feinstein of California and Mary Landrieu and John Breaux
of Louisiana, would help more than a dozen oil companies recoup huge
investments in offshore oil leases from Oxnard to San Luis Obispo.</LD>
<LD>   The bill also would turn the 40 tracts--most of them covering nine
square miles--into ecological preserves that would be forever off
limits to oil and gas drilling.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going to swap the tracts that our people feel should never
be drilled off our beautiful coast for tracts off Louisiana where
they want to drill," Boxer said. "If it works right, we will all be
celebrating."</TE>
<TE>   The deal proposed by the four senators received a warm, if
cautious, reception from the Bush administration, which has been
criticized for policies that favor oil companies and other industries
over environmental protections.</TE>
<TE>   "We are willing to consider any proposal that will resolve the
issues regarding these offshore leases," said Mark Pfeifle, spokesman
for Interior Secretary Gale Norton.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists privately complained that the bill
represents a bailout for big oil.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, relished the idea of ending a fight over offshore
drilling that began in the early 1980s when former Interior Secretary
James A. Watt opened nearly all federal waters to oil development.</TE>
<TE>   "If this flies, it would be a historic outcome; it would be the
end of the offshore drilling threat to federal waters off
California," said Richard Charter, a marine conservation advocate
with Environmental Defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that worth some money? Yes, I think it is."</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials said the deal could be worth $2.8 billion or
more to oil companies that hold offshore oil leases in federal waters
along the Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo county
coastlines.</TE>
<TE>   The payments would come in the form of credits the companies could
use when they bid on tracts in the central and western Gulf of
Mexico. The companies could also use the credits to offset royalty
payments they would otherwise have to make to the government.</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo Energy Co. of Houston, which has a financial interest in
nearly two-thirds of the undeveloped leases, has been promoting the
idea of swapping oil leases for years in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo and other oil companies are frustrated that they
collectively have sunk as much as $2 billion into lease payments,
exploratory wells and other costs and reaped not a drop of the 1
billion barrels of oil estimated to lie below the ocean floor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been going on for two decades," said Jim Bray, a Nuevo
Energy spokesman. "Our senior executive's message was: 'Let's allow
the leases to go forward or reimburse us for our investments so we
can move on.' "</TE>
<TE>   The bill "will solve a difficult problem associated with oil
production off the coast of California," said Sen. Landrieu. "This
will mean more jobs for Louisianans and a more vibrant oil and gas
industry in my state."</TE>
<TE>   The oil companies would have to relinquish their rights to develop
the California leases and drop related lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, they filed a breach of contract suit against the
federal government for the delays and ever-changing rules that have
thwarted their ability to produce oil from these tracts.</TE>
<TE>   Company representatives said they were unsure that all of their
peers would agree to such terms. Besides Nuevo, Shell Oil and Exxon
Mobil Corp. have financial stakes in the leases. Other companies
include Delta Petroleum Corp., Ogle Petroleum, OLAC Resources,
Poseidon Petroleum, Samedan Oil Corp., and Amber Resources.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation does not address an additional 43 federal tracts
that are producing oil and gas. These production areas--sometimes
adjacent to undeveloped tracts--can be spotted by the offshore oil
platforms that dot the coast of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of California's waters are generally off limits to new
oil drilling because of federal and state moratoriums.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development Thursday, Boxer, Feinstein and 30 other
California Democratic members of Congress filed legal arguments to
support the state's right to review any new oil development to ensure
that it doesn't harm the environment.</TE>
<TE>   A decision last year by a federal judge prohibits oil production
from undeveloped offshore tracts until the California Coastal
Commission can assess its effects on water quality, marine life, air
quality and scenic vistas.</TE>
<TE>   Given the potential for environmental problems, such a review
could doom the chances of exploiting oil reserves beneath many of
these tracts.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Bush administration appealed the decision to the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara), and other lawmakers said the
bill introduced Thursday would not influence the lawsuit. They see
the suit as setting an important precedent for state's rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot risk another oil spill off our coast," said Capps, who
represents the coastline once coated with oil from the 1969 blowout
of an oil platform. "This is all about local control."</TE>

<HD>Hahn-Parks Clash Based on Divergent Philosophies</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Differing views on solving department problems, not
specific failings on the chief's part, led to split with the mayor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The conflict between Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks is stark in its political dimensions, but the issues
Hahn has wielded to find fault with Park's leadership are murkier
than their public clash would suggest.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn, in opposing a second term for the chief, has criticized
Parks on three specific fronts: his department's level of compliance
with a federal consent decree, his approach to community policing,
and the LAPD's inability to recruit and retain more officers.</LD>
<LD>   An examination of the issues shows that the divide is more over
philosophy than over specific failings by the chief, who is seeking a
second five-year term from the city Police Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn and Parks also differ in their assessment of the difficulties
that lie in the Los Angeles Police Department's path. Hahn insists on
high standards and says they can be met in such areas as police
reform and recruiting without unacceptable costs. Parks contends that
such issues are complicated by conflicting policy aims, and that
tough choices must be made between, for example, high standards for
recruits and increased hiring.</TE>
<TE>   In his statements last week, Hahn said he was "unhappy with the
progress" on compliance with the federal consent decree, and gave the
example of delayed reporting of excessive-force investigations to the
Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But several of the key players involved in implementing the decree
have argued that the LAPD's compliance record under Parks is, if not
flawless, pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   The federal consent decree in force over the LAPD consists of an
agreement the city of Los Angeles entered into with the U.S.
Department of Justice in 2000 under the threat of a federal lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The decree, which Parks opposed before its signing, spells out
guidelines for reforming the LAPD to protect the civil rights of Los
Angeles residents who come in contact with the police.</TE>
<TE>   The highly detailed agreement sets out a variety of requirements
the LAPD must meet in coming months. The decree's laundry list of
requirements ranges from collection of racial profiling data to
development of a computer system to track problem officers
electronically.</TE>
<TE>   Although none of the major players argues that compliance has been
perfect, and problems have been acknowledged on all sides, there
seems little evidence of serious rifts to date over the department's
cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   The federal judge handling the decree has so far issued no
sanctions for noncompliance. And an independent monitor assigned to
keep tabs on compliance progress has cited problems, but also issued
a compliment in November, saying that the city and the LAPD had
"cooperated fully" and "expended great efforts" to comply. A more
up-to-date report is expected as soon as today.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission, which is appointed by the mayor and will
decide Parks' fate, "has not taken any position that indicates
[compliance] is not satisfactory," said Joe Gunn, commission
executive director. And Chief Legislative Analyst Ronald Deaton told
the City Council Wednesday that the LAPD is basically on track.</TE>
<TE>   Given this, some parties to the agreement have objected to Hahn's
contention that problems with compliance reflect a lack of commitment
to reform.</TE>
<TE>   "Complying with the consent decree is a very complex and demanding
responsibility," said Terree Bowers, chief deputy under City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo, who supports Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, Bowers said, "progress has been reasonable, and at
times, excellent."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who heads the council's
Public Safety Committee, calls the LAPD's efforts "fairly heroic."</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't mean there is not room for improvement," she said.
"But we have made a sea change."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's aides explained that the mayor does not think the LAPD and
city have failed to meet their legal obligations to comply with the
consent decree. Instead, they drew a distinction between what they
say is a level of compliance that merely meets legal requirements,
versus what they termed a higher level of compliance sought by the
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn considers the consent decree, "a baseline," said Tim McOsker,
the mayor's chief of staff. "He has always said, these provisions are
not a ceiling but a floor."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn promises that he will push a reform agenda that goes beyond
the consent decree. A proposal for civilian oversight of LAPD
discipline is such a reform.</TE>
<TE>   Parks defends his record on reform by pointing out that portions
of the final consent decree adopted changes he had already put in
place in the department.</TE>
<TE>   Because the consent decree has been interpreted with some
flexibility by the parties involved, it is possible to argue the
compliance question both ways.</TE>
<TE>   Although in theory the city has agreed to comply with the decree
in every detail, in practice the measure used has been whether the
city and the LAPD have made reasonable progress toward meeting most
deadlines, and been sincere about shaping up when compliance has
fallen short.</TE>
<TE>   'Senior Lead Officers' Among Main Issues</TE>
<TE>   In the area of community policing, Hahn has faulted Parks for a
continuing failure to strongly back an outreach program manned by
"senior lead officers" that Parks had terminated shortly after his
appointment as chief in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Such officers' main duties are to meet with community groups and
solve local crime and nuisance problems rather than patrol in
black-and-white cruisers.</TE>
<TE>   First assigned under former Chief Willie Williams, they offered a
stable, familiar presence to community advocates. Senior leads had
time to develop expertise in dealing with various city bureaucracies,
and were popular because they were a familiar presence and were easy
for residents to contact.</TE>
<TE>   Parks tried to replace the program with a model similar to that
used by a number of police departments across the country.</TE>
<TE>   This model requires that, rather than assign a group of dedicated
officers to community policing, the function should be integrated
into regular patrol duties for all officers. The change was needed in
Los Angeles, Parks argued, because critics had said that ordinary
LAPD officers needed to be mindful of community concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The Rampart Independent Review Panel, for example, said that,
although senior leads forged strong bonds with residents, line
officers sometimes seemed to take a dim view of community policing,
to the detriment of the department.</TE>
<TE>   But Parks' solution, placing community policing in the hands of
patrol officers, doesn't work as well if officers don't have much
free time to perform their community policing duties, law enforcement
experts say. Parks' action also triggered sharp opposition from many
neighborhood activists who feared that community policing would
simply fall by the wayside.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Richard Riordan eventually told Parks to restore the
program. The chief proceeded to negotiate an agreement with the
police union that was approved by the City Council. It allows senior
leads to work as much as four days a week on community policing, but
requires them to return to patrol cars at least once a week. The
agreement also gave commanders considerable latitude to pull them
away from senior-lead duties at other times and deploy them according
to local needs.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't sit well with community groups, which remain
dissatisfied, and Hahn faults Parks for not pushing to ensure that
senior leads spend the maximum possible time on community policing.
Parks counters that the program is being carried out as agreed.</TE>
<TE>   As a practical matter, however, this issue is closely related to
another that separates Hahn and Parks--recruitment and retention of
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Put simply, LAPD is so short-handed that the senior leads are
sometimes needed to cover threadbare shifts, LAPD officials say. For
example, Senior Lead Officer John Pedroza of the Hollenbeck Division
is unhappy that community policing doesn't get more support, and says
that the senior leads are spending too much time in patrol. At the
same time, he said, he has returned to his patrol car without
complaint lately because his station is stretched so thin, and "my
first job is to be a police officer."</TE>
<TE>   That tension is present throughout the LAPD. Although they defend
the department's record on restoring the program, Parks and other
LAPD commanders contend that tough choices must be made between
community policing and responding to emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have anyone to answer radio calls, all the community
policing in the world won't make those people happy," said Deputy
Chief Ron Bergmann, citing response times in the San Fernando Valley
that have dragged out to as long as nine minutes lately.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn agrees that 911 calls must be answered, but "we shouldn't
have to sacrifice an effective community policing tool," he said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn Faults Parks on Recruitment</TE>
<TE>   The mayor contends that LAPD staffing problems have been
exacerbated by what he terms Parks' failures in the recruitment and
retention of officers.</TE>
<TE>   Historically under-policed relative to other large cities, Los
Angeles makes do with 8,910 officers to cover 466 square miles--far
fewer officers than police in other major cities and considerably
below the department's peak strength of 9,852, which it hit in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years the department has shrunk because more officers
are leaving than entering. The LAPD has more officers today than it
did in the mid-'90s, but lags far below the number it has been
authorized to hire--10,196, more than at any other point in its
history.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD's officer shortage is probably at least in part a
reflection of trends nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting is "a significant issue throughout law enforcement,"
said Gilbert Moore, spokesman for the Office of Community Oriented
Policing Services at the Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the LAPD's recruiting difficulties are worse than anyone
else's is arguable. Statistics suggest that, when growth in
authorized positions is taken into account, the LAPD is somewhat
worse off than, say, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department--which draws from a similar pool--but the difference is
not that much.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department is short about 415 deputies, making it
about 5% below its authorized allotment of officers. Similarly, the
San Diego County Sheriff's Department is short 170 deputies, about 7%
of its authorized number.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD's problem appears larger, since its force is about 12%
short of its authorized number of officers.</TE>
<TE>   But that is in part because the LAPD has tried to increase the
size of its department so rapidly--expanding the number of budgeted
sworn positions by about 20% over the past five years.</TE>
<TE>   Had the LAPD been trying to grow at a rate closer to the 14%
target set by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in the same
period--LAPD vacancies today would be only about 8%, much closer to
the sheriff's shortfall and nearly the same as San Diego County's.</TE>
<TE>   Be that as it may, there remains considerable concern that the
number of recruits entering the LAPD academy has fallen markedly,
decreasing to just 197 entrants last year, from 1,151 in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, attrition also exceeded projections. Although
resignations recently fell to their lowest level since Parks became
chief, there are still a lot of officers leaving before
retirement--250 officers last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and Parks differ sharply on their assessment of why officers
are leaving while few are entering.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn holds that the problem is strongly related to low morale on
the police force, a persistent concern of the Police Protective
League, the union representing LAPD officers that has sharply opposed
Parks' reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Rank and file officers are looking for a better leader, and
boosting morale is Parks' responsibility, Hahn argues.</TE>
<TE>   Parks counters that there is a trade-off between holding recruits
to higher standards, and keeping the bar low enough to allow many to
qualify. Difficulty in hiring may be one price of a higher-quality
work force, he suggests. For example, new lie detector tests for
recruits have eliminated many candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Parks Concedes Morale Has Suffered</TE>
<TE>   Standards are an issue, Hahn concedes, but "it just means you have
to work a lot harder."</TE>
<TE>   When pressed, Parks also concedes that morale on the force may
have suffered as a result of changes he has made, particularly to the
department's discipline system. These have resulted in many more
officers facing investigations. But he argues that the connection
between such morale issues and retention has not been proved.</TE>
<TE>   At the request of The Times, the LAPD evaluated reports from exit
interviews of the 250 officers who resigned last year.</TE>
<TE>   The top three reasons they cited for leaving were better pension
plans at other departments, better salaries, and better work
schedules, according to the department's analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-one of the 250 officers who departed, however, cited Parks'
disciplinary policies as one reason they no longer wanted to work for
the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Parks and Hahn also differ in their view of how this might be
addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Again, Parks argues for a tough choice: He says that costs to
morale, recruiting and retention may be the temporary price of better
discipline that ensures that officers are held accountable for public
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "When we balance officer morale against community morale, we will
always decide community morale is more important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn counters that the disciplinary change need not affect the
desire of officers to work for the LAPD--in essence that tougher
discipline and morale need not conflict so much.</TE>
<TE>   McOsker, Hahn's chief of staff, said Parks could have done more to
ensure that expansion of the discipline system did not drag down
morale, for example, by speeding up investigations. Parks responds
that he has acknowledged that problem and is trying to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   But the mayor says it is time to make a change.</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker's Bills Would Have Benefited His Firm</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Efforts to help medical groups do not appear
to be illegal. But critics cry foul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Granada Hills assemblyman with an ownership stake in one of the
region's large medical groups has pursued legislation and regulatory
action that would benefit such groups in the health-care marketplace.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Keith Richman has served as author or coauthor on two
pieces of legislation aimed at improving the financial position of
the small niche of companies that serve as middlemen between health
maintenance organizations and patients.</LD>
<LD>   He also has asked the state Department of Managed Health Care to
intervene in situations where such companies believe that HMOs should
pay them more money, and requested a full audit of the department
shortly after its chief, Daniel Zingale, refused to do so.</LD>
<TE>   Richman's actions do not appear to be illegal, several experts in
campaign finance and conflicts of interest said. The assemblyman
sought an opinion from an attorney for the Assembly Ethics Committee,
and the lawyer concluded that ownership alone does not amount to a
conflict of interest. He urged Richman to discuss the matter again
with him, however, if he intended to support bills that would benefit
the medical group financially.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a debate is brewing over Richman's dual roles. Richman says
his expertise in health care has inspired important efforts at
health-care reform. But when asked about the assemblyman's actions,
several legal experts and watchdog groups said they were troubled by
his sponsorship of legislation from which his company could benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were a legislator, I wouldn't be introducing legislation
that affects my company," said Robert Stern, head of the Center for
Government Studies, a watchdog group. "It just looks bad."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, a physician, is the former chairman of the board of
Lakeside Health Care, which treats 100,000 patients, most of them in
the San Fernando Valley. He resigned from that position when he was
elected to the Assembly in 2000, but remains on Lakeside's board of
directors, drawing a salary described in state disclosure reports as
from $10,000 to $100,000 per year. He owns from 3% to 4% of the
company, which is described in the same documents as worth $100,000
to $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Richman says the financial problems plaguing medical groups need
to be addressed and he has the expertise to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand how [Lakeside ownership] may have the appearance
of conflict, but I think that my arguments on the merits of any
bills, including health-care bills, need to stand on their own," said
Richman, who is up for reelection in November. "I bring an expertise
from my experience both as a physician and as a person who's run and
served on the board of directors of a large medical group, and that I
think brings value to the Legislature."</TE>
<TE>   Stern and others argue that Richman's pursuit of legislation that
could affect Lakeside Health Care points up the need for stricter
conflict-of-interest laws.</TE>
<TE>   "What's troubling about it is you have a person who has the access
to make legislation who is in a position to benefit himself by it,"
said Carol Scott, a former member of the Fair Political Practices
Commission who now works as a health-care lawyer in Sherman Oaks.
"And what's even more troubling is that it's not black and white
enough that someone could say something about it."</TE>
<TE>   State law prohibits legislators from introducing bills that would
directly benefit a company in which they own shares or which has paid
them a salary during the past year. However, if the legislation would
also affect other companies, California law does not consider it a
conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Richman's critics say his situation is a little more tenuous
because his company is in a relatively small business niche.</TE>
<TE>   Lakeside Health Care is one of 259 companies licensed in
California to bear risk like a quasi-insurance company. Those
companies take monthly payments from HMOs and use the money to pay
for patient care. But there is often not enough money to pay for all
the care required.</TE>
<TE>   Lakeside, like many such groups, appears to be in financial
trouble. According to state records for the first and second quarters
of 2001, Lakeside did not meet three financial tests set up by the
state to show whether a medical group is in sound financial
condition: It did not have working capital, tangible net equity or
engage in timely payment of claims to providers.</TE>
<TE>   Richman, like many doctors, believes that because HMOs have so
much market clout, a medical group cannot stay in business without
pleasing them. As a result, medical groups must either sign unfair
contracts or lose patients, he said.</TE>
<TE>   His legislation, he said, is intended to address that unfairness.</TE>
<TE>   One bill, written by Richman and vetoed last fall by Gov. Gray
Davis, would have made it illegal for health plans to enter into
contracts with medical groups that required the groups to pay for
expensive injectable medications such as those used in chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Relief from such a requirement could save a medical group millions
of dollars annually.</TE>
<TE>   The other bill, on which Richman is a coauthor with Speaker Pro
Tem Fred Keeley (D-Santa Cruz), would force the Department of Managed
Health Care to consider cases in which a medical group believed that
an HMO was offering an unfair contract. If the department declined to
take a position, then the medical group could enter a mediation
process. And if still unsatisfied, it could sue.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said in a December interview that he co-wrote the bill, AB
1600, out of frustration with the department because it has "chosen
not to" intervene when doctors and medical groups have said they were
being underpaid by health plans.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was pulled from the legislative calendar late last year,
but Richman says it will be reintroduced later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Richman has criticized the department and the Davis administration
for its reluctance to intervene in contracts between HMOs and medical
groups.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to department chief Zingale dated Sept. 12, Richman
upbraided the Davis appointee for "timidity" in dealing with health
plans. That same day, he requested a state audit of the department.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Thompson, chief lobbyist for the California Medical Assn.,
which is sponsoring AB 1600, said Richman is a "very honest guy" who
is addressing a legitimate problem and is not seeking to enrich
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Pellissier, Richman's chief of staff, said he urged his
boss to divest himself of his shares in Lakeside Health Care when the
physician was elected.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said he did not because Lakeside could not buy them back
and he did not believe there was an outside market for them. Instead,
the Assemblyman sought an opinion from the Assembly Legislative
Ethics Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The legal opinion, written by attorney Scott Hallabrin, says that
if a bill affects other companies as well, Richman's ownership in
Lakeside does not constitute a conflict. The attorney urged Richman
to contact him again if he was considering supporting a bill that
might benefit Lakeside, but Richman hasn't done so, Hallabrin said.</TE>

incorrectly suggested that the two bills supported by Assemblyman Keith
Richman (R-Granada Hills) would financially benefit a medical group in

<HD>Tollway Board Cuts Lanes for the Foothill Extension</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Directors halve the proposed South County
roadway after ridership projections are sharply reduced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A controversial proposal to build a tollway through environmentally
sensitive areas in south Orange County was cut in half Thursday after
updated traffic studies showed ridership would be far less than
originally predicted.</LD>
<LD>   Directors for the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency
unanimously agreed to scale back the planned Foothill South extension
from eight to four lanes. The 16-mile extension would run from
Mission Viejo to Interstate 5 at Camp Joseph H. Pendleton Marine
Corps Base.</LD>
<LD>   "The average daily traffic will not support an eight-lane road
before 2025," said James Brown, director of engineering and
environmental programs for the agency that operates the county's toll
roads. "We should build only what is needed."</LD>
<TE>   Faced with information that tollway ridership projections are off
the mark throughout the county, board members are taking steps to get
an accurate sense of how the county's network of turnpikes is doing.</TE>
<TE>   Ridership in east Orange County, where proposed residential and
retail development has been greatly reduced, will now be reexamined.
And a consultant will be hired to complete an independent financial
analysis of the San Joaquin Hills toll road, a coastal turnpike that
has repeatedly failed to meet ridership expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The toll road network is operated by the Transportation Corridor
Agencies, a joint powers authority based in Irvine. The San Joaquin
Hills, the Foothill, the Eastern, and a short stretch of California
133 are in the system. Extending the Foothill South into San Diego
County will complete the network.</TE>
<TE>   But revised traffic estimates show that the number of paying
customers will be about half the number originally projected on the
road's most southern stretch and 20% to 30% behind projections in
other sections.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 projections and the revised forecasts were done by
consultant Terry Austin, the Orange County Transportation Authority,
Caltrans and the Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   Toll road officials said they had planned to build an eight-lane
highway--four lanes in each direction--before 2025. But the new
traffic figures indicate that only four lanes are necessary, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the proposed change, the board voted Thursday to
increase the Foothill South's budget for planning and environmental
analysis by $3.5 million. Design work for the eight-lane highway also
will proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are learning that our assumptions in planning can change,"
said Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who is a Foothill/Eastern
board member.</TE>
<TE>   Toll road officials cautioned that traffic projections might
change again given the recent decision to build more than 14,000
homes in Rancho Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed development was not considered in the traffic
forecasts. But Brown said he did not think growth from that
development or others would be enough to justify an eight-lane
turnpike by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, who oppose the Foothill South extension, said
the scaled back proposal and the inaccurate traffic figures show the
project is in serious trouble and should be halted.</TE>
<TE>   Groups such as the Sierra Club and the Surfrider Foundation hope
to block the tollway in an effort to save vast stretches of wildlife
habitat in south Orange County. They also oppose a proposed route
that would cut through San Onofre State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Evans, Surfrider's executive director, described the
Foothill South traffic projections and their revisions as something
short of "voodoo."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal "is a mess financially, environmentally, and from an
alignment standpoint," Evans said. "It's like watching sausage being
made. If the public saw this, they would be appalled."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's action is not the only time that inaccurate and
outdated traffic projections have affected county toll roads. Board
members for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor are now
concerned about declining bond ratings and the road's continuing
failure to meet its projected traffic and revenue, which were used to
justify the sale of $1.8 billion in bonds.</TE>
<TE>   If performance trends continue, the San Joaquin Hills toll road
might face technical default in 2007 on $1.8 billion in bonds sold to
build the 15-mile turnpike between Newport Beach and San Juan
Capistrano, meaning revenue would be less than promised investors.</TE>
<TE>   Toll officials said they are studying changes in proposed
developments in eastern Orange County and their potential effect on
the Foothill and Eastern toll roads, the county's most successful
turnpikes. Both roads are running about 8% ahead of projected traffic
volumes.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not happy" with some of the traffic forecasts, said
Foothill/Eastern board member Harold R. Kaufman, who sits on the Dana
Point City Council. "We need to get a feel on where we are going."</TE>

<HD>Third-Strike Plea Bargains on Rise in O.C.</HD>
<DH>Crime: Under D.A. Tony Rackauckas, fewer repeat offenders
are getting 25-to-life sentences, which mirrors a statewide trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas took office three
years ago, the number of three-strikes cases settled with plea
bargains has increased significantly, prompting debate over whether
his policies are furthering justice or obstructing it.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, according to an analysis of court and state
records, Orange County has had a sharp decline in the number of
repeat felons receiving life sentences, recording the biggest drop in
the state in the years since Rackauckas became district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas took office with the promise that he would lift his
predecessor's longtime ban on prosecutors participating in plea
bargains. The move has been hailed by many judges and prosecutors for
streamlining court operations and better ensuring that punishment
fits the crime. But critics said the new policy skirts the law's
intent and creates the potential of innocent defendants being coerced
into taking deals.</LD>
<TE>   A Times review of more than 1,000 Orange County three-strikes
cases--those in which some felons face life in prison for a third
conviction--found that under the Rackauckas administration:</TE>
<TE>   * Nearly 90% of the three-strikes cases were resolved without
trials--a significant increase over Rackauckas' predecessor, Michael
Capizzi.</TE>
<TE>   * Nine out of 10 three-strikes cases resolved during Rackauckas'
first three years in office ended without the defendant receiving the
maximum sentence, 25 years to life in prison. The vast
majority--90%--of those sentences were signed off by prosecutors as
part of plea agreements.</TE>
<TE>   * Orange County's record is part of a statewide trend of fewer
three-strikes defendants getting life sentences. From 1996 to 2000,
the number of repeat offenders in Orange County sentenced to life
declined from 78 to 29--a 63% decline. In Los Angeles, the number
dropped by 44% and statewide by 39%, according to the California
Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' pledge to lift his predecessor's plea bargaining ban
was a central part of his 1998 campaign for district attorney, and
his record is expected to come under scrutiny as he faces a tough
reelection challenge from veteran prosecutor Wallace Wade.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said his policies have made the system more judicious.
He said his prosecutors are tough on repeat offenders who commit
serious crimes but show a sense of proportion to offenders whose
third strike is for a minor offense, like drug possession. He
criticized Capizzi for often seeking maximum punishment regardless of
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's why I decided to run. They were dragging in people who
shouldn't get 25-to-life and committing an injustice," Rackauckas
said. "We're looking at the case and deciding what the proper
sentence is and saying that's what we want and that's what we're
going to demand."</TE>
<TE>   It's now common for Orange County prosecutors to propose dropping
the law's 25-to-life sentence if defendants plead guilty and accept
reduced prison terms. And while that's one way to avoid imposing the
stiff sentence on small-time criminals, some defense lawyers fear the
emphasis on plea bargaining might cause some innocent defendants to
take a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like putting a gun to the client's head," said Santa Ana
criminal defense attorney Richard Schwartzberg. "You could plead
guilty to something you say you didn't do and get three or four
years. Or you could go to trial and if you're convicted you'll go
away forever."</TE>
<TE>   The potential dangers of this, critics said, was highlighted
during the Los Angeles Police Department Rampart Division scandal
when several suspects who had been framed by officers pleaded guilty
to crimes they didn't commit out of fear of the three-strikes life
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Wade, Rackauckas' challenger, raises another criticism: that the
plea bargain policy violates the spirit--and the letter--of the
three-strikes law that voters overwhelmingly approved.</TE>
<TE>   California's three-strikes law has been highly controversial from
the moment it took effect nearly eight years ago. The law requires
the first two strikes to be certain serious or violent crimes, like
rape, murder or robbery. But the third strike can be for any felony,
including petty theft or possession of a single piece of rock
cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   The courts have lessened the impact of the law. In 1996, the
California Supreme Court ruled that judges do not have to impose the
25-to-life sentence in certain circumstances. And a federal appeals
court ruled this month that sending someone to prison for life for a
petty theft is "cruel and unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the three-strikes law have proposed a change that
would require a third strike to be a serious or violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the number of repeat offenders receiving life sentences
is decreasing statewide--with the biggest decrease in Orange County,
according to state Department of Corrections files.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis of Orange County's three-strikes cases found that the
number of repeat offenders receiving life sentences has been steadily
declining during Rackauckas' term.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the last year Capizzi was in office, 65 repeat felons
were sentenced to life, according state records. The number dropped
to 62 in 1999, 29 in 2000 and 20 during the first 10 months of 2001,
the most recent records available.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors signed off on 90% of the three-strikes sentences over
the last three years. The remaining 10% of cases went to trial, with
the judge ultimately deciding the defendants' sentences.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to handle it without regard to the statistical data,"
Rackauckas said. "What we have to do is look at each case and not be
concerned that, 'Oh my gosh, we haven't sent enough people away for
25-to-life.'"</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said his prosecutors continue to pursue the 25 years to
life sentence for offenders whose conduct shows they remain a danger
to society.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Jacob Pinney was sentenced to 36 years to life in
prison last year after his conviction for a street robbery in
Anaheim. Pinney had seven prior robbery convictions--all before the
three-strikes law took effect.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, prosecutors dropped a potential life sentence in a
plea bargain with Andrew Olivera, a 35-year-old man whose first two
strikes were for residential burglary and whose third strike was for
the attempted possession of a small amount of cocaine. Olivera
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 16 months in state prison,
records show.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's predecessor, Capizzi, prohibited
prosecutors from plea bargaining. For a case to be settled without a
trial, the judge and the defense attorney would have to hammer out a
deal on their own, with the prosecutor playing no role in the
negotiations. Judges loudly complained about the policy, which they
said backlogged the system and put too much of the burden of
resolving cases on them.</TE>
<TE>   Now, under Rackauckas, prosecutors can negotiate freely with
defense lawyers. In the first three years he has been in office,
about 90% of three-strikes cases were resolved without trials.</TE>
<TE>   In Capizzi's last three years in office, roughly 77% of
three-strikes cases were resolved without trial, mainly through
negotiation between judges and defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's approach to three-strikes cases contrasts in some
ways with the policy of Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley.
Cooley allows deputies to seek less than the maximum sentence against
repeat offenders--even if the defendants refuse to plead guilty.
Cooley's written policy on the three-strikes law cautions, "The
potential for coercive plea-bargaining must be avoided."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles prosecutors are instructed not to pursue life
sentences if the third strike is for a nonviolent offense, except in
unusual circumstances and then only with a supervisor's
authorization.</TE>
<TE>   Some Orange County defense attorneys said that Orange County
prosecutors rarely are willing to reduce charges against a repeat
offender until he agrees to plead guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way it works," said defense attorney Jim Brott. "It's
only stricken if you plead guilty. There's none of this, 'We'll
strike the strike and you can go on fighting.' That does not go on in
Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Wade, a veteran Orange County prosecutor, said requiring
three-strikes defendants to plead guilty in order to receive a lesser
sentence is against the law and Rackauckas should stop the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't think a case is worth 25-to-life, they should
dismiss a strike on their own without holding it over the defendant,"
Wade said.</TE>

<HD>Camera Provides New Focus for Former D.A.</HD>
<DH>Gil Garcetti, at loose ends a few months ago, is
photographing Disney Hall and its ironworkers. The result will be his
first book, due out in the fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The roof on which Gil Garcetti stood was sloping crazily, like some
asphalt-coated Tilt-a-Whirl. It veered up here, swirled down there. A
plumb line, hung from the edge, would have served mainly to
demonstrate the sheer, leering un-plumbness of Disney Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Garcetti, former district attorney of Los Angeles County, was near
the northeastern cornice of the soon-to-be concert hall, lots of sky
above and below him. If he had turned his head just 30 degrees or so,
he would have had a fine view, framed by iron girders, of his old
office in the downtown Criminal Courts Building. If he had slipped,
well....</LD>
<LD>   He kept his footing and looked straight ahead at two ironworkers
on "the float," a sheet of plywood that hung in space beneath a
girder they were welding. He raised a little Leica camera.</LD>
<TE>   The shutter was too quiet to make an audible click.</TE>
<TE>   For six months now, Disney Hall has been Garcetti's workplace. The
former prosecutor, defeated by current Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley in
November 2000, has turned to the unlawyerly pursuit of photography to
record the construction of a building that appears destined to become
a landmark.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti's focus has been the ironworkers who have nearly finished
their portion of the job, raising the steel-clad skeleton that will
give Disney Hall its eccentric, billowing shape.</TE>
<TE>   With the cooperation of their union, Ironworkers Local 433, he
plans to publish a book of his photographs sometime in the fall, a
year before the hall's opening. Proceeds will go to the union's
choice of charities.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem an unusual career move for an ex-prosecutor, someone
best known for his dapper television appearances in a losing cause,
the trial of O.J. Simpson. But Garcetti seems to be having the time
of his life, bounding about the rebar and chatting up tattooed
construction workers who have come to accept him as an ally, if not
quite one of their own.</TE>
<TE>   When ironworker Sue Egberts first saw him, she said, "I was kind
of surprised. I didn't know this was an interest of his." She
demanded that he remove his sunglasses so she could confirm that this
Gil, the one everybody was talking about, was indeed that Gil, the
former D.A.</TE>
<TE>   He was. In time, she said, she came to admire him.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, he's put a lot of energy into this," she said. "You see
him almost every day--at least once or twice a week--just taking the
time to document what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti, 60, has been a serious amateur photographer for 32
years, since the birth of his daughter, Dana, who is now a Los
Angeles County deputy district attorney. He shoots and develops in
black and white, as might be expected from someone who has spent his
life in the noir world of Los Angeles criminal justice.</TE>
<TE>   The book, his first, will be published by Balcony Press of
Glendale, which specializes in art and architecture. Its working
title is "Iron: Erecting Walt Disney Concert Hall." Frank Gehry, the
architect of Disney Hall, has agreed to contribute the forward,
Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is what Garcetti expected to be doing after he lost a
bitter race against Cooley, one of his top deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the loss, he said, he threw himself into another
campaign, that of his son, Eric, for Los Angeles City Council. Eric
Garcetti won in June, leaving his father at loose ends.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Garcetti decided to spend the next six months doing
whatever he wanted. There was just one hitch: "I didn't know what
that was," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had said no to law firms," he added. "That's not what I wanted
to do. I'd practiced law for 32 years. They wanted me in three
capacities: Either as a 'rainmaker,' someone who brings money and
clients in; two, their government relations person on a local, state
and national level; or three, be their trial lawyer.... And I said,
you know, I don't think that's really what I want to do with the rest
of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Then, one day in July, he was driving home from a meeting downtown
when he saw an ironworker crawling along an arched beam high atop the
rising superstructure of Disney Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti usually keeps a camera in his car, and he reached for it.
It wasn't there. He drove on, but the image of the ironworker stuck
with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I came back the next day with my cameras," he recalled. "I was
across the street.... And I started taking photographs of them, and
it was just neat. I had this one guy who crawled off the 'zoom boom,'
as they call it, which takes them up high, and he was a bolter-upper;
once the beam has been put in place and just connected, it's his job
to bolt it up together.</TE>
<TE>   "And so I saw him crawl off and balance himself on this arched
beam. His footings were on a small piece of steel on the outside, and
I mean, I was just amazed at his balancing act--the acrobatics of it
all."</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti was hooked. Not long after, he called the ironworkers
union to ask if he could get onto the construction site.</TE>
<TE>   "The business agent got on the phone and said, 'Gil, we'll send
you a thousand dollars.' And I laughed and said, 'I'm not running for
anything.' And he said, 'Oh, I thought that's why you were calling.'"</TE>
<TE>   After that was straightened out, Garcetti received the permission
he wanted in exchange for a promise to shoot a picture for an
ironworkers publication. Before long, he was making near-daily treks
from his Brentwood home to Disney Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Ironworkers are famously proud and notoriously prickly. Garcetti
has worked hard to fit in.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, it was like, being a district attorney, what's he doing
out here?" recalled Brent Allen May, the union steward on the
project. But the workers warmed to Garcetti after he began giving
them photos of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "No one appreciates what we do, usually," May said.</TE>
<TE>   There were jokes, of course. When Garcetti interviewed
photographic subjects, ironworkers would say he was "taking a
confession." His interviewees became sure targets for ribbing. "You
have no idea," lamented one worker, Mitch Shanholtzer.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 helped break the ice. The ironworkers see a close link
between themselves and their New York counterparts who have worked on
the cleanup of the World Trade Center, and early plans called for
proceeds from the book to go to Trade Center charities. Now that
those charities are sufficiently funded, most of the proceeds will
probably go to other needy organizations.</TE>
<TE>   With the project almost done, Garcetti has begun to think about
his future. He doesn't know what he'll do, although he said he
retains a "passion for public policy" and doesn't rule out another
run for office. Then again, he doesn't rule out another photo project
either.</TE>
<TE>   He got some career advice from an ironworker recently.</TE>
<TE>   "They gonna make an ironworker outta you?" the man yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sir!" Garcetti replied.</TE>
<TE>   "If they get you hanging out there," the man said, pointing to the
highest beams, "you'll wish they'd made you a pipe fitter instead."</TE>

<HD>Young Gets $28.5 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First baseman Dmitri Young, who has batted .300 or better in four
consecutive seasons, agreed Thursday to a $28.5-million, four-year
contract with the Detroit Tigers.</LD>
<LD>   The deal contains a club option for 2006 that could become
guaranteed if he plays regularly, and which would make the contract
worth $37 million over five years.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a major signing for us, just a fantastic deal for us," Tiger
General Manager Randy Smith said. "When we acquired Dmitri, we were
thrilled to get a guy in the prime of his career who hit .300 the
last four years. "</LD>
<TE>   Young, 28, came to the Tigers in December from the Cincinnati Reds
in a trade for outfielder Juan Encarnacion and reliever Luis Pineda.
The Reds shed Young as part of a cost-cutting effort.</TE>
<TE>   Young batted .302 with 21 home runs and 69 runs batted in last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Young had asked for a raise from $3.5 million to $6.15 million in
arbitration. He had been offered $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former major league outfielder and designated hitter Chili Davis
agreed to serve as a minor league hitting instructor in spring
training for the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Davis played 19 seasons in the majors for five teams and was a
teammate of Diamondback Manager Bob Brenly in the minors and with the
San Francisco Giants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Martinez arrived at the Boston Red Sox clubhouse at Fort
Myers, Fla., more muscular and, for a change, early for spring
training.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez threw smoothly and showed no sign of the worst injury of
his brilliant career, which limited him to career lows of 18 games
and seven victories last season, none in the last four months.</TE>
<TE>   An off-season program in his native Dominican Republic, in which
he lifted weights regularly for the first time, helped Martinez, who
is 5 feet 11, report at about 190 pounds, 12 pounds heavier than last
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Paul's plan for a new ballpark for the Minnesota Twins sailed
through its first legislative committee during a hearing.... The
Texas Rangers agreed to one-year contracts with pitchers Colby Lewis
and Andy Pratt and outfielders Ryan Ludwick and Kevin Mench.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yankees signed Ruben Rivera to a $1-million, one-year
contract. Rivera, 29, batted .255 with 10 homers and 34 RBIs for
Cincinnati last season.</TE>

<HD>Green Hits Another Game-Winner</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Green didn't let the ball out of his hands this time.</LD>
<LD>   Against Utah State last Saturday, the UC Irvine standout was
forced to give up the ball and Mike Hood's last-second three-point
attempt missed in a one-point loss.</LD>
<LD>   With the Anteaters again down one point with the game on the line
against Cal State Northridge, the senior guard kept matters in his
own hands.</LD>
<TE>   Green made a 15-foot jumper with 15.8 seconds left and added a
free throw to help Irvine earn a key 82-80 Big West Conference
victory Thursday night before 1,509 at the Matadome.</TE>
<TE>   As a number of NBA scouts looked on, Green saved his best for the
end. Starting from the right wing, he found some space to his left
when Northridge guard Gene Myvett fell down. Green got to the
free-throw line and drilled the jumper over Markus Carr.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of got some revenge," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   The Anteaters (18-7, 11-3) avenged a one-point overtime loss Jan.
19 at Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to take anything away from Mike, but I like to take the last
shot," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine remained in a first-place tie with Utah State.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a career-high 20 points from Curtis Slaughter and 16 from
Lionel Benjamin, the Matadors (8-14, 7-6) dropped their fourth in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   "He made a big-time shot," Slaughter said. "All you can do is tip
your hat to him."</TE>
<TE>   Green finished with a game-high 22 points, hitting seven of 11
shots. Hood and Adam Parada each had 17 for Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   They led the Anteaters back from a 76-71 deficit with 3:01 left.
Parada made two free throws and then stole a pass from Carr.</TE>
<TE>   Green came down and made a three-pointer from the corner. Hood
then drilled another three for a 79-76 lead after Jordan Harris drew
a charging foul on Carr.</TE>
<TE>   "Our kids hung tough," Irvine Coach Pat Douglass said. "We made
some turnovers, but we stayed positive and kept being aggressive.
Every game you win on the road is a big win."</TE>

<TE>   Utah State 60, Cal State Fullerton 45--Jeremy Vague scored 14
points and grabbed eight rebounds to lead Utah State to victory at
Logan, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Desmond Penigar added 11 points and five rebounds for the Aggies
(19-4, 11-3).</TE>
<TE>   Pape Sow finished with 17 points and nine rebounds for the Titans
(4-18, 1-12), who have lost 18 in a row at Utah State.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State 77, Pacific 63--Travis Reed scored 17 points and
took nine rebounds to lead Long Beach State to the victory at
Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Reed made seven of 10 shots from the field for the 49ers (14-8,
6-7). Michael Darrett scored 14 points and Ron Johnson added 12 for
Long Beach, playing its first game since Coach Wayne Morgan announced
his plans to retire at the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Demetrius Jackson led Pacific (9-16, 5-9) with 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside 67, Idaho 56--Lloyd Cook scored a season-high 16
points to lead UC Riverside over Idaho at Moscow, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   The Highlanders (8-13, 5-8) moved into seventh place in the
conference while the Vandals (8-15, 5-9) fell to eighth.</TE>

<HD>West Virginia Coach to Retire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gale Catlett, mired in the worst season of his 30-year career,
announced his retirement as West Virginia's coach Thursday at
Morgantown, W.Va., one day after blasting his team for its poor
performance and lack of pride.</LD>
<LD>   The 61-year-old Catlett said the retirement would be effective at
the end of the season. His assistant and nephew, Drew Catlett, was
promoted to bench coach.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously the pressure of an unsuccessful season weighed upon
him, but there was absolutely no pressure from the university,"
athletic department spokesman Mike Parsons said.</LD>
<TE>   Catlett will "still be involved 'til the end of the season,"
school spokeswoman Shelly Poe said. However, she could not provide
specifics, including whether Catlett would run practices.</TE>
<TE>   Catlett's retirement comes less than a week after he returned to
the team after missing two games because of an infection, and a day
after the Mountaineers (8-15, 1-10 Big East) lost to Virginia Tech,
78-63.</TE>
<TE>   This season's team has one of the worst records in West Virginia
history, and the worst in Catlett's 24-year tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Catlett is West Virginia's winningest coach, compiling a 439-276
record.</TE>
<TE>   In 30 years as a college coach, he is 565-320. He is one of 45
Division I coaches who have more than 500 wins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drew Gooden, the Big 12's leading scorer and rebounder, was held
out of practice Thursday and his status for No. 2 Kansas' game
Saturday against Baylor was uncertain.... Mount St. Mary's (Md.)
fired assistant basketball coach Don Anderson as it investigates
allegations he improperly placed phone calls to Cameroon on behalf of
a player. The school suspended sophomore forward Patrick Atangana,
Athletic Director Harold Menninger said.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>After 18, There's Still 52 to Go</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 18th at Riviera Country Club enjoys a reputation as one of the
greatest finishing holes in golf. It's an uphill, 451-yard par-four
with a blind tee shot and green so fast it should have a checkered
flagstick. You get done with that thing and you should be able to
relax, except you can't. The problem is that you're on the green and
the clubhouse is way up there on top of the hill behind you.</LD>
<LD>   And any golfer will tell you, it's hard to get to the top, whether
it's winning tournaments or climbing those steps to the clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   There are 52 steps, railroad ties with gravel between them. A
handrail runs up the hill beside the steps, which are just to the
right of the main scoreboard at the back of the green. After the
first 23 steps, you make a left turn for four steps, then turn back
uphill for the last 25 steps. Now you are safely on the putting green
and it is a good time to try to find your breath. Turn around, look
back out at the course and you can take stock of what you have done.
Not only have you played 18 at Riviera, you are also about 70 feet
higher than you were 52 steps ago.</LD>
<TE>   A bronze statue of Ben Hogan is just on the other side of the
putting green. The artist has depicted Hogan without the bottom part
of his club. This is understandable. The way Hogan played, he could
have swung air and still knocked the ball into the hole. But Hogan is
facing the clubhouse, not the 18th. He must have hated those darned
steps, too.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Pavin has climbed the steps a bunch of times, twice as a
winner on Sunday, in 1994 and 1995. You would think he would be so
familiar with the path, he would know how many steps there are, but
he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Pavin was told there are 52.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one too many," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He had just jogged up the steps and crossed in front of Joe
Durant, who was suitably impressed with Pavin's goat-like ability. "I
can't do that goin' down 'em," Durant said.</TE>
<TE>   After awhile, it was pretty clear that just about every player had
his own technique for making the climb. You know, it figures. After
all, some players have loopy backswings, some players walk up the
steps as if their courtesy car is strapped to their backs.</TE>
<TE>   It was a near miracle that John Daly made it up the steps, what
with all the logos he was carrying on his clothes. He had seven
endorsement logos, and once you get more than four or five they can
really get heavy. Daly needed to steady himself on the rail just once
on his way up.</TE>
<TE>   John Daly is tough.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Billy Andrade. Moments after he finished the 18th by
knocking a five-iron to 30 feet at the back of the green, then
rolling in the putt for a monster birdie, Andrade started up the
steps. His climbing style is pretty elementary. "You put your head
down and you count every one of those 38 steps and then you reach the
top and you take a deep breath," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Andrade can't count.</TE>
<TE>   However, he can be counted on to be superstitious. He shot a 66
Thursday to put himself one shot out of the lead at the Nissan Open.
He had also climbed the steps by not touching the gravel between the
railroad ties. "I went wood-to-wood," Andrade said. "I'll go
wood-to-wood tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gove's style of walking up the steps was unusual in that he
touched the wood only with the backs of his shoes. It was pretty
unique performance, although the judges in Salt Lake probably would
have hated it.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Quigley was another runner. He was already at the putting
green before his caddie made the turn near the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Donald simply trudged the whole way, his head down. When he
looked up, he seemed surprised to be at the top. Donald is from
Buckinghamshire, England, so he is also probably surprised when he
sees the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Briny Baird raced his caddie up the steps. Baird had just shot a
71, and that must have lightened his step, since he missed the cut
last week at Torrey Pines.</TE>
<TE>   Munching on an energy bar as he made his way up the steps, Glen
Hnatiuk showed how coordinated he was, able to walk and eat at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   After making his par putt at 18, Per-Ulrik Johansson made his way
up the steps.</TE>
<TE>   He wore a white glove, white shoes, white slacks, a white sweater
with red pinstripes and a red shirt. With his bleached-blond hair,
Johansson looked like one of those singers from Abba. It was a very
cool look. It's unclear what Johansson's work clothes used to look
like, but it doesn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   What's important is that with all those railroad ties in a row and
stretching to the sky in front of him, they were the right clothes.
They were clearly a step up.</TE>

<HD>He Knew Sabean Was Creating a Giant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News commenting on Tsuyoshi
Shinjo, the San Francisco Giants' new outfielder who was introduced
at a recent news conference: "He appears to understand just enough
English to perhaps wonder if General Manager Brian Sabean had the
right guy. Sabean seemed to be describing a cross between Seattle
sensation Ichiro Suzuki and former Japanese home run king Sadaharu
Oh.</LD>
<LD>   "It was as if Shinjo was taking his place alongside the Golden
Gate Bridge and Chinatown as San Francisco's newest tourist
attraction."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   More Shinjo: "No wonder [he] originally balked at being traded. He
had eased into a part-time role with the [New York] Mets. Now he has
to compete with Fisherman's Wharf.</TE>
<TE>   "'I will be a tourist attraction,' Shinjo said bravely."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the UCLA single-game record for rebounds?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, he did: The East Coast Hockey League suspended Toledo
defenseman Chris Slater for 36 games for lunging at a fan during a
game. A league investigation determined that the incident occurred
after the fan, Bruce Downey, yelled, "Slater, why don't you do
something?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Slater: "During the game, I think he said it a few times.
That's all it took."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Role reversal: New Viking Coach Mike Tice played for George
O'Leary in high school. Now Tice has hired O'Leary to his staff in
Minnesota. This could be an awkward situation.</TE>
<TE>   Tice recounted this conversation with O'Leary about the matter: "I
said, 'Coach, you know when you take the job, do me one favor. This
is not Central Islip High School in New York. Please don't yell at me
in front of the players or the other coaches.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dog discrimination: Lou Guerrerro has a show champion dog. But
there's a problem--it's an Afghan hound.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that 9-11 happened, I'm very careful where I go with my dog,"
Guerrero said. "When people ask what kind she is, I just say, 'She's
a hound dog.' The only reason I do this is for fear of possible
retaliation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Say please: ABC-TV's Dan Fouts said it during the Pro Bowl:
"[Tampa Bay's] Keyshawn [Johnson] has a new book coming out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called 'Just Give Me a Damn Coach.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another title: "If Michael Jordan saves his marriage," Jerry
Greene of the Orlando Sentinel asks, "will he be the comeback husband
of the year?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Willie Naulls, 28, against Arizona State in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe on the Red Sox,
who report to training camp today:</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when the Sox were the only team that mattered
around here. Never out of season, never out of style, the Red Sox
were a 24/7 entity. The Sox owned the market. They could be arrogant.
And they were.</TE>
<TE>   "No more. The Patriots have given us a taste of champagne. They
have shown Boston that the last game doesn't have to be a whopping
disappointment. They have shown us that sometimes team supercedes
individual achievement. It doesn't always have to be about headache
and heartache."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe no team in the country can exploit a weakness better than No. 1
Duke.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Boozer scored a career-high 32 points and the Blue Devils
warmed up for their Atlantic Coast Conference showdown this weekend
at Maryland by blasting No. 24 North Carolina State, 108-71, Thursday
night at Durham, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   "We saw in the first game they had a hard time guarding down low,"
point guard Jason Williams said. "And today when I was driving their
big guys kept coming to me. That left Carlos open for a lot of easy
baskets. When you have a guy in there that big you really can't miss
him."</LD>
<TE>   Boozer was 13 of 14 from the field as Duke (23-1, 11-1) moved
one-half game ahead of the third-ranked Terrapins in the ACC. Both
teams have one loss and no other team in the conference has fewer
than four.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have the best perimeter in the country right now,"
Boozer said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can penetrate and dish and they did a great job of passing
it to me. Our guards can break down teams with ease."</TE>
<TE>   All of Duke's victories since its Jan. 6 loss to Florida State
have been by double digits and the Blue Devils beat the Wolfpack
(18-7, 7-5) for the 17th time in 18 games, including 12 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight we witnessed an awesome basketball team on all
cylinders," Wolfpack Coach Herb Sendek said.</TE>
<TE>   N.C. State came in with the ACC's best scoring defense at 64.1
points a game, but gave up a season-high point total and the most
under Sendek in 185 games.</TE>
<TE>   Duke shot 69% from the field in the second half and 63% for the
game.</TE>
<TE>   OTHER GAMES</TE>
<TE>   Rutgers 65, Notre Dame 62--Ricky Shields scored 14 of his 16
points in the second half and made two free throws with 18.8 seconds
remaining for Rutgers in a Big East game at Piscataway, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's Chris Thomas, who scored 32 points against Rutgers in
a 17-point victory last week, was held without a field goal and
missed a three-point attempt as time ran out. He finished with six
points. Rutgers (16-8, 6-5) snapped a five-game winning streak by
Notre Dame (17-7, 7-4).</TE>
<TE>   Xavier 89, George Washington 75--Romain Sato scored a career-high
34 points, making six of 11 three-point attempts, for Xavier in an
Atlantic 10 game at Cincinnati. Xavier (18-4, 10-1) got its 13th
victory in 14 games and retained its lead in the conference over St.
Joseph's, which visits on Saturday. George Washington is 10-13, 3-9.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno State 72, Texas El Paso 64--Melvin Ely scored 28 points to
become Fresno State's all-time leading scorer and the short-handed
Bulldogs defeated the Miners in a Western Athletic Conference game at
Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Ely's career total of 1,764 points surpasses Wil Hooker, who
compiled 1,739 from 1989-92.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno State (16-10, 7-6) used six players after starting point
guard Chris Sandy was suspended indefinitely before the game for
receiving an improper benefit. Forward Nick Enzweiler scored a
career-high 17 points for Texas El Paso (9-17, 3-11).</TE>
<TE>   Butler 77, Wisconsin Green Bay 74--Rylan Hainje and Brandon Miller
scored 20 points each to lead Butler (22-3, 10-3) to a victory
against Wisconsin Green Bay (3-9, 6-17) in a Horizon League game at
Green Bay. Green Bay guard DeVante Blanks had his half-court shot at
the buzzer hit the back of the rim and miss.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay shot 62.5% from the field, including six of eight from
three-point range. The team also made 18 of 20 free throws and
outrebounded Butler, 23-19.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Center overcomes foul trouble to block
seven shots and spark the Spurs, 89-76.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Out of the All-Star break, into the frying pan.</LD>
<LD>   Having harvested their various honors over All-Star weekend, the
Clippers returned to the grim reality of the Western Conference
playoff race Thursday night at Staples Center, fading as the game
went on and David Robinson emerged, falling to the San Antonio Spurs,
89-76, for their third loss in a row.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson, 36, and off to the slowest start of his career, went to
the bench 2:36 into the game with two fouls, then returned in the
second quarter and went on to block seven shots to go along with 12
points and five rebounds in 24 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Duncan blocked another three shots, and there went the
Clippers' shooting percentage, all the way down to 35.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Said Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry: "David just decided to block
everything tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Said Spur Coach Gregg Popovich: "I thought David Robinson was a
monster tonight."</TE>
<TE>   For sure, he devoured the Clippers' post-up offense. With Robinson
playing badminton with their shots, Elton Brand made one of 10 shots
from the floor and Quentin Richardson missed all 11 of his shots.</TE>
<TE>   "They definitely played great help defense tonight," said
Richardson. "It was evident they weren't going to let me score down
there. They dropped a man back into the lane and their big men came
over as soon as I turned into the lane."</TE>
<TE>   Besides hurling themselves at Robinson and Duncan and getting
hurled back, the Clippers spent the night barking at the referees,
also without getting anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the game's waning moments, Darius Miles and Danny
Ferry bumped, exchanged shoves and were each assessed a technical
foul. Miles, taken out of the game at that point, stomped off to the
dressing room, tearing off his uniform top as he went.</TE>
<TE>   "That team right there, they're a very good defensive team,"
Gentry said of the Spurs. "If you're not making shots and you have to
drive it to the basket, you're in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi, who had 20 points and 12 rebounds in the
Clippers' recent upset win in San Antonio, played another strong
game, scoring 15 points with 12 rebounds and holding Duncan to 15
points and on five-of-13 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers led, 25-20, after one quarter but scored 15, 17 and
19 in the next three, shooting 30%, 33% and 40%, respectively. Put it
all together and it spells l-o-s-s.</TE>
<TE>   "With expectations comes pressure," said Gentry before the game.
"Obviously, there's a little extra pressure on us. We're not a
novelty act any more.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody takes us serious when they come into play or we go on
the road. We have to be prepared to play because nobody takes us
lightly any more. We can't use youth as an excuse any more....</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that I told our guys, usually at this stage when we
come back from the All-Star break, we're talking about playing for
pride. We've got something tangible to play for this year. I think
it's important we understand that."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs are famous for their big front line, with its twin
7-footers, but the Clippers jumped all over them early. Olowokandi
drew two quick fouls against Robinson, who quickly found himself back
on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers wound up out-rebounding the Spurs, 18-7, in the first
quarter, including one extended possession in which they took five
shots and rebounded four of them.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers led, 25-20, after one quarter and extended it to
27-20 early in the second, when Keyon Dooling, playing his first game
since Nov. 15, hit a 17-footer.</TE>
<TE>   Soon afterward, however, Robinson returned and began putting a
serious crimp in the Clipper offense by blocking shots, particularly
those of Brand and Richardson.</TE>

<HD>Odom Sprains Ankle After Dunk</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when you think Lamar Odom's season can't get any worse, it does.</LD>
<LD>   Having played only 29 games with the Clippers and scheduled to
wear a cast on his sore right wrist for two more weeks, Odom dunked a
basketball in Thursday's shoot-around, stepped on the ball, fell and
sprained his right ankle.</LD>
<LD>   X-rays were negative, but the ankle was put in a soft cast.</LD>
<TE>   This injury is expected to keep him out for two to four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sad," said Odom. "There's nothing I can do about it. It was a
freak accident. I just want to do everything I can to get back as
soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's Tracy McGrady got a major reaction for lobbing the ball
off the backboard to himself for a dunk in Sunday's All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   However, he may have gotten the idea from the Clippers' Darius
Miles, who did the same trick in the second half of Saturday's rookie
game.</TE>
<TE>   Miles didn't get the idea from anybody. In his case, it was an
accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Kenyon [Martin] and Q [Quentin Richardson] on the other
side of the floor and I had the ball in the middle," said Miles.</TE>
<TE>   "I jumped to throw the oop [lob] to Kenyon and I got caught in the
air. And I just threw it off the backboard and caught it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi came into Thursday's game having averaged 12.3
points over his last four games.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he might have been more consistent, going 20-27-2-0.</TE>
<TE>   He played the last two after getting five teeth loosened in a
collision against Boston. A dentist is still working on his teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi has never worn a mouthpiece and says he doesn't intend
to start.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time it's happened and I've been playing
basketball for seven years," he said. "So I figure I won't wear a
mouthpiece for another seven years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keyon Dooling, out since the second week of the season because of
a badly sprained left ankle, returned to action Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Twin Wins for Gordon, Waltrip</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Veterans lead way in Daytona 500 qualifiers.
Robinson will be first woman in 500 since '77.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>After the two Gatorade Twin 125 qualifying races Thursday at Daytona
International Raceway, the biggest question is not if the Fords need
more aerodynamic help to be competitive, or if Jeff Gordon is headed
for a fifth Winston Cup title, or if Michael Waltrip can win his
second consecutive Daytona 500.</LD>
<LD>   The bigger question is: Will Sunday's 500 be like the first Twin,
won easily by Gordon, or like the second Twin, won by Waltrip in a
struggle?</LD>
<LD>   If it's like the first, fans might be better off watching curling
from the Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   If it's like the second, it could be 500 miles of old-fashioned,
hard-nosed racing that could keep the anticipated 225,000 fans on
their feet for most of three hours.</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolets continued to dominate. Both winners were in Chevys, as
are Sunday's front-row pair of rookie Jimmie Johnson and Kevin
Harvick.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, in his fourth Winston Cup race, got a lesson from
NASCAR's rule-makers when he was given a stop-and-go penalty for
driving below the yellow line on the seventh lap of the first race.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the El Cajon off-road veteran was running fifth. With
no yellow caution flags during the 50-lap sprint, he never recovered
and finished last.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not trying to test NASCAR by any means," Johnson said. "I
was trying to protect our race car. Mike Wallace was blocking me and
running me below the yellow line on the backstretch and to avoid a
wreck I crossed the line and jumped on the brakes to try to keep from
passing him, but I had Ward Burton pushing me through and I guess I
completed the pass and they didn't like it."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon took the lead from Johnson on the first time around the 2
1/2-mile triangular oval and was never seriously challenged.</TE>
<TE>   A five-car breakaway of Gordon, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Ken Schrader,
Ricky Rudd and Wallace ran together for the final 35 laps and the
only change came when Wallace dropped back and Terry Labonte took
over fifth place.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have as strong a car as I had and you get out front that
early, the leader has a huge advantage," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon averaged 183.674 mph, close to Johnson's pole qualifying
185.831.</TE>
<TE>   A seven-car accident and two caution flags gave the second race
more the look of a Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   Waltrip, who won last year's 500 by holding off a charging
Earnhardt Jr., had Tony Stewart and a pack of 15 to 20 cars on his
bumper most of the 46 laps he led.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, that was wild out there," Waltrip said. "I was a busy man
those last 20 laps. Maybe the caution flags helped keep the pack
together in our race, I don't know.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came off the last turn and saw Tony coming at me, I tried
to block him, first right and then left so he couldn't pass me and it
worked. It was wild from where I was sitting."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who lost Sunday's Budweiser Shootout by holding off
Earnhardt Jr., agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a good car for Sunday, but I'll tell you what, though,
Michael Waltrip just did a great job today," Stewart said. "His car
got real wide. There are going to be a lot of good cars Sunday. I
think you get both of these two groups together and you're not going
to have what we had in the first race."</TE>
<TE>   The accident was triggered when the ignition cut off on Mike
Skinner's car. He slowed and was hit in the rear and turned sideways
by Buckshot Jones. Before cars stopped spinning and crashing, Shawna
Robinson, Bobby Gerhart, Dave Blaney, Jimmy Spencer and Jones were
knocked out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, hoping to be the first woman in the Daytona 500 since
Janet Guthrie in 1977, made the 43-car field with her qualifying
speed of 182.663--the slowest car to qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Blaney also got in the race through an owner's provisional, but
Spencer, who left Travis Carter's team to switch to Chip Ganassi's
Target car this season, will miss his first 500 in 11 seasons because
Ganassi has no provisionals.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys made some questionable moves, and they made the race,
and we didn't," Spencer said. "There's nothing you can do when you
get hit from behind."</TE>
<TE>   One driver who escaped the accident and made the 500 field by
finishing seventh was Dave Marcis, who will be 61 on March 1. He will
be starting his 33rd Daytona 500 and has announced it will be the
final race of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "The race car does not know how old the driver is," said the
popular Marcis, who still wears wing-tip shoes when driving. "I seen
the car [in the wreck] coming sideways so I stayed on the gas, found
a hole and got through it."</TE>
<TE>   The Ford drivers weren't nearly as happy, even with the
quarter-inch reduction in the height of their rear spoiler given them
last Sunday, a change that NASCAR President Mike Helton said should
save two-tenths of a second a lap.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I think the quarter-inch helped? No," snapped Dale Jarrett
after finishing 10th in the first race. "I wouldn't have ever known
that anything had changed if I hadn't seen them cut it off myself."</TE>
<TE>   The highest finishing Ford was Rudd, fourth in the first race. His
will be the only Ford in the first seven rows.</TE>
<TE>   In Busch series qualifying postponed from Wednesday, Joe Nemechek
won the pole for Saturday's Live Well 300 with a 186.254 mph lap in
his Pontiac.</TE>
<TE>   Former Winston Cup drivers Ted Musgrave and Ron Hornaday Jr. will
start on the front row today in the Florida Dodge Dealers 250, the
opening race of the Craftsman Truck series.</TE>
<TE>   Also today will be the first round of the 26th International Race
of Champions, a 40-lap dash for 12 drivers from different types of
racing. On the front row will be former Indy 500 winner Kenny Brack
of Sweden and World of Outlaws sprint car champion Danny Lasoski, who
earned their spots in a blind draw.</TE>

<HD>Tracy Has a Spring in His Step</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With Sheffield gone, Dodger manager can focus on
tangibles instead of daily drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>He lost one of the game's best right-handed batters, an All-Star
starting pitcher and an All-Star closer, two of his top pitchers must
rebound from serious elbow surgery, his woeful center-field and
leadoff spots were not upgraded, his shortstop will likely be an
untested 21-year-old rookie, and his roster is bloated with fat
contracts that are virtually impossible for his general manager to
trade.</LD>
<LD>   So why is Dodger Manager Jim Tracy so giddy?</LD>
<LD>   Well, wouldn't you be excited if you were about to embark on your
first real spring training as a major league manager?</LD>
<TE>   Tracy may have been the Dodger manager last spring, but in name
only, not spirit. He was more psychologist than field general, more
counselor than coach, because many days and sleepless nights were
spent worrying whether a time bomb named Gary Sheffield would explode
and send shrapnel through the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   But Sheffield and all his disruptions--his daily blasts at Dodger
Chairman Bob Daly, his claims of being underpaid and disrespected,
his threats he wouldn't play hard if he wasn't given a lifetime
contract--are gone, dealt to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Brian
Jordan and pitcher Odalis Perez in January.</TE>
<TE>   Without Sheffield, Dodgertown is likely to feel more like a
baseball camp and less like a hostage situation. Pitchers and
catchers will hold their first workouts today, and Tracy will face
all sorts of questions for six weeks: Who will be his closer? Who
will be his fifth starting pitcher? Who will start in center field
and at shortstop? Who will bat leadoff? Who will win bench spots?</TE>
<TE>   But no Sheffield crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be fun, it's going to be refreshing," Tracy
said. "I missed out last year on enjoying the whole sphere of your
first year as a major league manager. You respond to challenges when
they surface; unfortunately, mine came even before I put my uniform
on, and I had to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   This spring, the only question regarding Sheffield is how the
Dodgers will replace him. For all the grief he caused, Sheffield
averaged 37 home runs and 103 runs batted in the last three seasons,
power numbers that Jordan is not expected to match.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine with Tracy, who believes if Jordan can produce his
usual 25 homers and 100 RBIs, and right fielder Shawn Green and
catcher Paul Lo Duca have superb seasons, and first baseman Eric
Karros and third baseman Adrian Beltre return to form after
injury-plagued 2001 seasons, and the Dodgers are more aggressive on
the basepaths, they should have enough offense to compensate for
Sheffield's loss.</TE>
<TE>   Karros is sound after batting a career-low .235 with 15 homers and
63 RBIs in a season marred by lower back problems. Beltre is back at
full strength after his harrowing ordeal last winter and spring when
he underwent surgery to close a wound in his abdomen after a botched
appendectomy in the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   "We're healthier, we're more athletic and we're deeper this year,"
Tracy said. "My third baseman showed up a year ago with a hole in his
body. Green stretched ligaments in his thumb sliding in his first
spring training game. Kevin Brown had an Achilles' problem, Karros
had a back problem, we had that other [Sheffield] issue.</TE>
<TE>   "But things seem to be falling into place in a lot more peaceful
manner. That situation last spring is such a thing of the past for
me."</TE>
<TE>   If Brown and Andy Ashby recover from elbow surgery, the Dodger
rotation should be deep and competitive, with Japanese pitchers
Kazuhisa Ishii and Hideo Nomo joining Brown and Ashby, and Omar Daal,
Eric Gagne and Perez battling for the fifth spot.</TE>
<TE>   If Brown and Ashby suffer setbacks, the Dodgers could struggle,
because their rotation won't be as good, and they don't appear to
have an offense that can out slug teams. Even with Brown and Ashby,
the Dodgers need to be more creative on offense.</TE>
<TE>   With the speedy Cesar Izturis at shortstop, a sound Beltre able to
steal 20 or more bases and the athletic Jordan replacing Sheffield,
the Dodgers could have more weapons. But Jordan will have to hit
consistently to prevent opponents from pitching around Green.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 58 one-run games last year and went 29-29 in them," Tracy
said. "Was there a situation where we could have taken the extra
base, gone from first to third [on a single], stolen a base? When you
see a healthy Beltre, an athletic Jordan, a good baserunner in
[second baseman] Mark Grudzielanek, I think we can do a much better
job on the basepaths."</TE>
<TE>   An effective leadoff batter would help. Tom Goodwin, who batted
.231 with a .286 on-base percentage, and Marquis Grissom, who batted
.221 with a .250 on-base percentage, provided little in the way of
table-setting. McKay Christensen and Dave Roberts will push them for
the center-field job, and the winner will likely bat leadoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to have a guy step forward and become a catalyst for
this club?" Tracy said. "That's something we missed last year. We
don't really want to step out of house to look for an answer, but
someone has to make that statement."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy feels the same way about his closer situation. The Dodgers
let Jeff Shaw (43 saves in 2001) go and are confident Matt Herges can
matriculate from set-up man to closer, but Herges has only two career
saves. If Herges, Paul Quantrill or possibly Giovanni Carrara don't
step up this spring, the Dodgers will increase efforts to trade for a
closer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a big believer in opportunity," Tracy said in regards to
Herges. "Once you get the opportunity, if you don't take advantage of
it, then it's up to us to take the next step."</TE>
<TE>   What's the next step for the Dodgers? They went 86-76 despite a
barrage of injuries last season, finishing six games behind eventual
World Series-champion Arizona. Though their rotation looks stronger,
their offense and bullpen look weaker.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a trimmed payroll, the Dodgers will still spend more than
$100 million for a team many don't expect to challenge Arizona and
San Francisco in the National League West. Then again, if they stay
healthy, pitch well and find some offensive balance, they could
contend.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at spring training this year as being a continuation, and
I don't think the Dodgers have been able to say that for a few
years," Tracy said. "We're always picking up the pieces, starting
over. Have we made changes? Yes. Could we improve through some more
changes? Yes. But I'm excited about building on the foundation we
laid last year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown will not be in camp today when the team holds its first
spring training workout. He received permission from the Dodgers to
report late, and the right-hander likely will be in camp by Monday.</TE>

<HD>Wynalda Back in His Own Galaxy</HD>
<DH>Soccer: L.A. picks up the 32-year-old veteran striker off
waivers, bringing the Fullerton native home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The long and winding road that has been Eric Wynalda's Major League
Soccer career finally returned to his front door Thursday afternoon
when the veteran striker from Fullerton was acquired by the Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   The move not only brings Wynalda home,  it also reunites him with
Cobi Jones, his former Westlake High  and U.S. national  teammate.
The 32-year-old forward was picked up on waivers after being released
by the Chicago Fire.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy, which opens its seventh season March 23, will be
Wynalda's fifth MLS team. He scored the first goal in league history
in 1996 while playing for the San Jose Clash, and later played for
the Miami Fusion, the New England Revolution and the Fire.</LD>
<TE>   "He had expressed an interest in playing in L.A.," Galaxy Coach
Sigi Schmid said Thursday afternoon while the team was training at
Cal State Fullerton. "I don't know the terms of the contract, but
certainly the dollars here were more workable for him because this is
where his home is.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have good, young forwards in [Brian] Mullen and
[Carlos] Ruiz and [Chris] Albright, but a player like Eric, with his
experience, can help them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Eric is at a stage where he wants to still contribute to
a team, he wants to win a title and he also wants to share his
knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   Wynalda scored an all-time record 34 goals for the U.S. during a
106-game national team career that lasted from 1990 to 2000. In the
MLS, he has played 98 games and scored 34 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Another former U.S. teammate, Galaxy defender Alexi Lalas,
believes Wynalda has more than just experience to offer on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric is someone I've known as a player and a friend for years,"
Lalas said Thursday. "At this point in assessing players, I only look
at what's going to make the Galaxy better.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that Eric is a player who, whether it's for the full 90
[minutes] or coming off the bench or whatever, is someone who needs
to be marked and needs to be worried about. That's something that we
definitely need. We need to put an element of fear into [opposing]
teams that they have to be aware of these players."</TE>
<TE>   Wynalda is expected to join the team before its departure Saturday
for a 13-day, four-game tour of Chile.</TE>
<TE>   In order to make room for Wynalda on the 23-man roster, the Galaxy
waived  forward Brian Ching, who played in eight games for Los
Angeles as a rookie last season.</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS news,  defender Ivan McKinley was acquired on waivers
by D.C. United. He will rejoin Coach Ray Hudson, his former coach at
the now defunct Fusion.</TE>

<LD>Ventura Buena High, the state's winningest girls' basketball program,
won its 700th game on Thursday night, but it wasn't easy.</LD>
<LD>   The Bulldogs overcame a third-quarter deficit to defeat visiting
Huntington Beach, 59-48, in a Southern Section Division II-AA playoff
opener and advance to the second round for the 26th consecutive
season.</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach (12-15) went on a 13-0 run in the third quarter
to take its only lead, 41-39. The Oilers then missed their next 14
shots as Buena (18-8) went on a 20-4 run.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't want the season to end this early," said Buena center
Courtney LaVere, who had 24 points, 11 rebounds and six blocked
shots. "We have a lot of pressure on us here, but we all rose to the
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Glassman had 11 points, Sheana Triana scored 10 and Shannon
Antunez added eight for No. 4-seeded Buena, which will meet Moorpark,
a 55-45 winner over Cerritos, on Saturday at a site to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Shaw scored 23 points, including five three-pointers, and
Pepperdine-bound forward Kelsey Ball added 12 before fouling out for
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In 31 seasons, Buena is 700-85, an .892 winning percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for the program," Coach Joe Vaughan said. "But we'd
like to get a few more this year."</TE>

<HD>Hoping to McPeek at the Right Time</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Lesson that trainer learned in 1995 Derby
could help this year with his two prospects, Repent and Harlan's
Holiday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Ken McPeek is a quick study. Not long after he had run his
first horse in the Kentucky Derby, he knew what he had done wrong.</LD>
<LD>   This was in 1995, a year when there was no clear-cut favorite in
the Derby. The public finally sent off the Wayne Lukas-trained entry
of Serena's Song and Timber Country as the lukewarm 3-1 choice.
Serena's Song was trying to become only the fourth filly to win the
Derby, and Timber Country was winless as a 3-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   McPeek's Tejano Run, also winless as a 3-year-old, became the
fourth choice and ran a solid race, finishing second to Thunder
Gulch, the Florida Derby winner who at 24-1 was one of the biggest
overlays in Kentucky Derby history.</LD>
<TE>   Before the Derby, Tejano Run had run only three times as a
3-year-old, but two of those races--the Jim Beam at Turfway Park and
the Blue Grass at Keeneland--had been only two weeks apart. The Derby
was the colt's third tough race in five weeks, not an optimum spacing
of assignments for a young horse about to be subjected to 11/4 miles
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned from that experience," McPeek says now. "I ran
Tejano Run one too many times."</TE>
<TE>   This is the right year for McPeek to profit from the
trial-and-error process of trying to win a Derby. Like 1995, the
128th Derby also might not have a strong favorite at post time May 4,
and early on, at Gulfstream Park, McPeek has been looking at two
colts that could be factors. Their names are Repent and Harlan's
Holiday, and both will be running on different fronts this weekend.
Harlan's Holiday will stay home, joining an eight-horse field in
Saturday's $200,000 Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream, while Repent has
already been flown to New Orleans for Sunday's $125,000 Risen Star at
the Fair Grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Although McPeek feels that his two horses are close in ability,
most of the attention has been reserved for Repent, who ran second to
the undefeated Irish horse, Johannesburg, in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile in October and then closed out his 2-year-old season with a
win at Churchill Downs in the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes. From the
first crop of Louis Quatorze, the 1996 Preakness winner, Repent
starts his 3-year-old season with a record of three wins, one second
and one third in five starts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, in a next-to-last workout for his 2002 debut, Repent
reeled off a too-fast 58-second clocking at Gulfstream. McPeek was
concerned, but then this week, before he was put on the plane for
Louisiana, Repent worked a half-mile in a more relaxed 48 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been working super," McPeek said. "Now I have to keep my
fingers crossed that he stays healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Both of the weekend's races are preps, the Grade III Risen Star
for the Louisiana Derby on March 10 and the Grade I Fountain of Youth
on March 16. Thunder Gulch is the last Fountain of Youth winner to go
on and capture the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Fair Grounds track will suit Repent's
[come-from-behind] style better," McPeek said. "I'd rather start out
Repent with a Grade III instead of a Grade I, and this way I can keep
him and Harlan's Holiday apart."</TE>
<TE>   The Fountain of Youth will be a rematch between Booklet and
Harlan's Holiday, who ran 1-2, separated by three-quarters of a
length, in another 1 1/16-mile race, the Holy Bull, at Gulfstream on
Jan. 19.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had the best horse that day," McPeek said, "and I
think he'll prove it Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   McPeek, 39, graduated with a business degree from the University
of Kentucky, but because of his father's influence as a thoroughbred
breeder he went to work at the racetrack the next day, walking hots
(cooling out exercised horses) for trainer Shug McGaughey at
Keeneland. McGaughey, another trainer with multiple prospects in his
quest for a first Derby win, will run one of them, Maybry's Boy, in
the Fountain of Youth. Saarland, considered to be McGaughey's better
Triple Crown contender, hasn't run since November and is expected to
land a Gulfstream allowance race for his Florida Derby prep.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday, who has been ridden by Tony D'Amico in all seven
of his races, will run without blinkers and is the 5-2 favorite on
the Fountain of Youth's morning line. Booklet, owned by John Oxley
and trained by John Ward Jr., the same crew that won last year's
Kentucky Derby with Monarchos, is second choice at 3-1. Others in the
field are Stephentown, Grey Beard, Speed Hunter, Political Attack and
Blue Burner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russell Baze is the winner of the 53rd George Woolf Memorial
Jockey Award. Baze, 43, has ridden 7,697 winners, which places him
fourth on the career list....</TE>
<TE>   Ten horses will try Saturday to prevent Leaping Plum, an
11-year-old gelding, from winning Fonner Park's Jake Grasmick
Memorial Handicap for the eighth straight year. Leaping Plum, who
will carry 122 pounds, same as last year and six less than his impost
in 1999 and 2000, will be ridden by Newil Wall, who rode him to
Grasmick wins last year and in 1997 at the Grand Island, Neb., track.
Wall, 53, was named as the rider Thursday even though he suffered a
hairline ankle fracture in a gate accident Saturday....</TE>
<TE>   Redattore, winner of the San Antonio Handicap, has been confirmed
by trainer Richard Mandella to run in the $6-million Dubai World Cup
on March 23.</TE>

<LD>With the Santa Anita feature race a nine-furlong allowance race for
California bred fillies and mares who are a combined 17 for 131, the
main event at Gulfstream Park is far more interesting.</LD>
<LD>   Besides being the next-to-last race in a pick six which features
the usual Friday bonus of a $25,000 guaranteed pool, the $100,000
Shirley Jones Handicap is a Grade III contest that attracted some
quality sprinters at Gulfstream.</LD>
<LD>   Between them, the seven fillies and mares who were entered in the
Jones have won 47 of 123 races and earned $2,594,579.</LD>
<TE>   Raging Fever, the likely favorite, will be trying for her second
stakes win of the meet for trainer Mark Hennig and owner-breeder
Edward Evans, who won the La Canada Stakes at Santa Anita last
weekend with 6-1 shot Summer Colony.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-year-old daughter of Storm Cat, Raging Fever won the First
Lady Handicap, also a Grade III, on Jan. 18, winning by two lengths.
She will be looking for her eighth victory in 11 career starts this
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Cat Cay, who has won seven of 20 and was second in the First Lady,
is back for more this afternoon and she will be helped by the extra
furlong of today's race. She has won two of five at the distance for
owner Ogden Phipps and trainer Shug McGaughey. The field is completed
by Irish Fantasy, Tugger, Celtic Melody, Vague Memory and Superduper
Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth brings together 11 veteran sprinters
running for a $50,000 tag. Contenders include A Touch Of Grey, the
lukewarm 7-2 favorite, Rapidough, Misanello and Waki American.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Longden. Responsible for arguably the most
memorable moment in Santa Anita history, the former jockey turned 95
on Thursday. In what was his final mount, Longden , then 59, won the
1966 San Juan Capistrano for a second consecutive year with George
Royal. Longden and George Royal prevailed by the slimmest of noses
over Plaque.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's third race at Golden Gate Fields.
The seven fillies and mares are a combined 0 for 60.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick four using A Touch Of Grey, Waki
American and Rapidough in the fifth, Del Chiaro, Without Bounds and
Crane in the sixth, singling Broke The Slump in the seventh and Go
Girl Go, Beautiful Sunshine and Qui's Rush In in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 4/109. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $30.80/$676.20. Total money bet: $628.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Lakers come into town. Shaquille O'Neal doesn't.</LD>
<LD>   You would think most coaches will be thrilled at the news, excited
to know that the paint won't be occupied by the most devastating
force in the league.</LD>
<LD>   Not Nate McMillan.</LD>
<TE>   The coach of the Seattle SuperSonics takes no comfort from the
absence of the Laker center, who is on the injured list because of a
toe injury.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very good with Shaq in there," McMillan said, "but
without him, they are more aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "They use a smaller lineup that really gets after you. One of the
things we like to do is run on them, but with that smaller team, they
really get back well on transition."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who missed his third consecutive game Thursday, will be
eligible to return for Tuesday's game at Staples Center against the
Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is expected to be ready, just as long as he doesn't do
anything dangerous, like work out with a medicine ball.</TE>
<TE>   During Laker practice Wednesday at HealthSouth Training Center in
El Segundo, O'Neal was engaged in an exercise that consists of
wedging the ball between his back and the wall and applying pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the ball slipped out, O'Neal fell backward, cracked his
head against the ungiving wall and slumped to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   He lay there inert, but then flashed a wide grin.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' hopes of a three-peat could have ended right there, no
matter what McMillan thinks.</TE>

Hawks out, 127-93, at Atlanta. And it doesn't figure to be much

<HD>Lakers Become Big Shots</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: No player is bigger than Bryant, who
finishes off the SuperSonics in 92-87 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Ultimately, it came down to Kobe.</LD>
<LD>   Again.</LD>
<LD>   It was Kobe Bryant who grabbed a crucial rebound with 30 seconds
to play and his Lakers clinging to a three-point lead Thursday night
against the Seattle SuperSonics at KeyArena.</LD>
<TE>   It was Bryant who raced down the left side, squeezed through two
defenders and reached back for a fancy spin move that gave the Lakers
two points and some breathing room and took the breath away from the
crowd of 17,072.</TE>
<TE>   It was Bryant who came down with the final, game-clinching rebound
with 10 seconds to play, absorbed a foul and made the two free throws
that assured a 92-87 Laker victory.</TE>
<TE>   But anyone who thinks that, in the absence of injured center
Shaquille O'Neal, Bryant is single-handedly keeping the Lakers on
course for a shot at a third straight championship just hasn't been
paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Bryant was within three rebounds of his second consecutive
triple-double Thursday night with 23 points, 10 assists and seven
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, Bryant has 25 assists in his last two games. But he
wouldn't have them if his teammates weren't converting the baskets.</TE>
<TE>   And Thursday night, they again responded to the emotional
challenge thrown out by Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Contributors included:</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher. He came off the bench and made only three of nine
shots from the floor. But without two of those baskets, the outcome
might have been different. With the Lakers down by six midway through
the fourth quarter, Fisher sank a pair of three-pointers</TE>
<TE>   Devean George, who also made a pair of three-pointers in the
fourth quarter when the Lakers made five of six overall from beyond
the arc. George also pulled down eight rebounds to tie for team-high
honors.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, who also had eight rebounds along with 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry, who shook off the effects of a tough hit by Desmond
Mason that rattled his teeth and bloodied his lip to make two big
fourth-quarter jumpers, one a three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   But the star of Thursday night's highlight reel for the Lakers was
still Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the game, he took it upon himself," Laker Coach
Phil Jackson said. "In the fourth quarter, we opened up the floor to
get him some space."</TE>
<TE>   Along with everything else he was doing, Bryant also found time to
keep a hand in the face of Seattle offensive leader Gary Payton.
Payton was only eight of 19 from the floor, finishing with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics made a run in the third quarter, their speed
reducing the Lakers to bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just running it down our throats," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't last.</TE>
<TE>   "We slowed them down," said forward Samaki Walker, "got into our
offense and got things done."</TE>
<TE>   No one struggled more than Laker forward Mark Madsen. He bobbled a
pass from Bryant early in the first quarter and things went downhill
from there. Madsen missed several shots under the basket, finishing
two for seven from the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him," Jackson said, "that he had two points and he should
have had eight."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson asked Bryant if he wanted to come out in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   No way, Jackson was told.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Barry led Seattle with 21 points on a night when the
SuperSonics dropped to 25-25.</TE>
<TE>   But Seattle lost more than a game.</TE>
<TE>   With 7.8 seconds left in the first half, Seattle forward Vin
Baker, driving toward the basket, stepped on the foot of the Lakers'
Stanislav Medvedenko and went down in obvious pain, clutching the
toes on his left foot as he rolled out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Baker had to be helped off the court, adding even more uncertainty
about Baker's future in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Now in his ninth season, Baker, 30, has been at the center of
SuperSonic trade speculation with the trading deadline only one week
away. Baker earns makes an average of $13.5 million annually through
the 2005-06 season.</TE>
<TE>   It was later determined that he dislocated three toes.</TE>
<TE>   But the SuperSonics will get no sympathy from the Lakers, who are
learning how to thrive, however temporarily, without O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe knows that if he plays hard," Horry said, "he makes it
easier for us. He's being the Laker star, making the people around
him better."</TE>

<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Corporate sponsors involved in NASCAR Winston Cup racing received
nearly $4 billion worth of exposure on telecasts last year, according
to Joyce Julius and Associates' sponsors report.</LD>
<LD>   Those kinds of numbers should make stock car enthusiasts giddy
over the future of their sport, but there is financial trouble
brewing along pit row. An economic fallout from bankruptcies and
wholesale personnel cutbacks has affected a number of teams,
especially with the cost of running a Winston Cup car now in the
range of $12 million to $15 million.</LD>
<LD>   Hardest hit have been Carl Haas and Travis Carter, whose drivers,
Joe Nemechek and Todd Bodine, are in Kmart-sponsored Fords.</LD>
<TE>   "It came as a real shock when I heard Kmart was bankrupt," Carter
said. "For one thing, if you anticipate a problem arising, it's not
going to be at the beginning of the year. This thing caught us off
guard. To hit us right in the midst of preparation for Daytona and
the entire season, we've got to take a deep breath and really start
thinking things through."</TE>
<TE>   Current plans are for the Haas-Carter Motorsports team to run here
Sunday and next week at Rockingham, N.C., but after that, it's
problematical.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, this is part of the reality of our sport," Bodine
said. "When someone like Travis Carter and Carl Haas go through a
situation like this, maybe it will wake some people up and wake our
sport up. We've got some problems and we better start addressing
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really that there are too many hands out, it's just that
there aren't enough sponsors to go around. It's hard enough to go
through this halfway through a year and knowing you've got six months
to work on it, but we've only got three weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Junie Donlavey has been fielding Winston Cup cars for 52 years and
has Rick Mast in his Ford this year, but his sponsorship is good for
only half the season. Mast believes that franchising, guaranteeing
teams a place in each race, could be the answer for obtaining
sponsorship money. It is a system used in Formula One and CART.</TE>
<TE>   "If these teams and sponsors were protected by whatever means,
like franchising, I know in our case this team would have a 36-race
sponsor signed right now," Mast said. "As it is, we're good for only
18 races.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is if you've got a company that's based at a race
track and they buy 28,000 tickets for their customers and they have
30 hospitality tents going on with literally thousands of folks and
that car doesn't make the race and goes home, that's a pretty big hit
on them.</TE>
<TE>   "These people that run these companies, all these executives,
these people have pride and egos just like all of us do and they
don't like that."</TE>
<TE>   He could have been describing what happened to a lucrative
sponsorship deal that Bobby Hancher's team had from Tabasco a few
years ago. A buildup that started nearly a year earlier at
Indianapolis ended when Todd Bodine failed to qualify for the Daytona
500.</TE>
<TE>   It's still referred to as the "Tabasco Fiasco" in NASCAR circles.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had a franchise, I would be in the catbird seat because I
would know that I was gonna be in the shows," said Brett Bodine,
Todd's older brother and owner of his own team. "You could take that
to a sponsor and guarantee them something. Right now, you can't
guarantee anything. You can't guarantee performance, you can't
guarantee finishes, you can't guarantee you're going to make the
race, and that's what makes this a very difficult sell.'"</TE>
<TE>   Even four-time Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who would appear
to be bulletproof as far as sponsorship money is concerned, admits
finding backing is a difficult proposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe it or not, during the whole time we were trying to win
the championship last year, Rick Hendrick and I were in meetings
trying to get sponsorship for the 48 car [driven by 500 pole-sitter
Jimmie Johnson].</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a clue as to how we won that championship because
there were a lot of long, long days and headaches because
sponsorships are not easy to come by these days."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart's Collection</TE>
<TE>   If short-track favorite Tony Stewart from Rushville, Ind., wins
Sunday's Daytona 500, he may want to arm-wrestle Bill France Jr. and
Mike Helton, plus car owner Joe Gibbs for the yellow and white Home
Depot Pontiac.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has started a collection of cars from what he considers
his major wins, and the Daytona 500 would surely be one of them.
However, NASCAR rules mandate that the winning car Sunday will spend
a year on display at Daytona USA.</TE>
<TE>   His latest acquisition was Keith Kunz's midget, which he drove to
victory in the Chili Bowl at Tulsa, Okla., last month. Stewart
offered his race winnings as a down payment to Kunz, a car owner from
Columbus, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-year-old car was also driven by Jay Drake when he won the
1998 Turkey Night Grand Prix, the Hut Hundred and the Pepsi Nationals
in 2000 and the Chili Bowl in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been Jay's favorite car for a long time, and he was sure
disappointed when I agreed to let Tony have it," Kunz told the
Indianapolis Star. "But I know Tony is going to put it away for all
the good reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said he had to have it because winning the Chili Bowl was
an emotional win.</TE>
<TE>   "I had butterflies for two hours after I won," said the Winston
Cup runner-up and winner of 12 races in three years as Gibbs' driver.
"I haven't had butterflies for two years."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has also bought Laguna Beach entrepreneur Steve Lewis'
midget that won last year's Turkey Night race at Irwindale, and John
Menard's Indy Racing League car that he drove from the pole in the
1996 Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has even boxed up the clothes he wore while carrying the
Olympic torch Jan. 7 in Indianapolis to display when he has his own
museum.</TE>
<TE>   Southland Notes</TE>
<TE>   Perris Auto Speedway will open the stock car portion of its weekly
Saturday night racing series with four divisions, including the
unusual cruiser cars. In cruisers, there are two people, one to steer
and use the brakes, the other to accelerate. New to Perris will be
the super stock and street stock classes. ... When J.J. Yeley won the
season-opening Sprint Car Racing Assn. race last Saturday at Perris,
it was is the third time he had won the SCRA opener. His other wins,
in 1997 and 1998, came at Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix. He also won
the inaugural race at Perris....SCRA champion Cory Kruseman of
Ventura completed his Indy Racing League test with a 207.6-mph run at
Las Vegas Motor Speedway. He was driving a Dallara-Chevrolet for PDM
Racing.</TE>

<LD>Following the lead of the NBA and major league baseball, the owner of
NASCAR's Web site plans to start charging stock-car racing fans for
access to its online audio and video feeds--just in time for its
biggest race of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Turner Sports Interactive, the AOL Time Warner subsidiary that
owns NASCAR's Internet rights, teamed with RealNetworks Inc. for the
subscription-based service, which expands on the audio and video
currently offered on the NASCAR Web site. The new service launches
Saturday, the day before NASCAR is scheduled to run the Daytona 500.</LD>
<LD>   Financial terms of the multi-year deal were not disclosed.</LD>
<TE>   Race fans won't have to pay immediately--Saturday's coverage will
be available as a free trial. But come Sunday, NASCAR.com will be
charging $29.95 a year or $4.95 a month for access to the site's
audio and video features.</TE>
<TE>   Real also will make it available as a $2-a-month add-on to the
RealOne package of sports, news and entertainment, which starts at
$9.95 a month. Real offers a two-week free trial of its service. A
spokesman for NASCAR had no comment on deal.</TE>

<HD>Webber's Play Does the Talking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two days after his tirade against the local media, Chris Webber spoke
volumes with his play.</LD>
<LD>   Webber, who is boycotting the media because of an article
regarding his personal life, had 20 points, 14 rebounds and nine
assists to lead the Sacramento Kings to their 20th straight home
victory, a 109-93 win over the Washington Wizards on Thursday at
Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Peja Stojakovic scored 21 points and Mike Bibby had 20 as
Sacramento improved its league-best record to 39-12.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings made 14 of 27 from the field and scored 36 points in the
third quarter, matching a season high for the period. Sacramento led
by as many as 26 points in the quarter and held an 83-59 lead after
three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "They controlled the tempo," said Michael Jordan, who had 16
points and made only six of 18 from the field. "We made some crucial
turnovers in the second quarter that ignited their transition. When
it gets that kind of game, we just can't compete."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who won their second consecutive since a 108-101 loss
to Washington last week, have not lost to the same team twice this
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards lost their second straight after winning their
previous five. Richard Hamilton had 20 points and Christian Laettner
had 14 points and 11 rebounds in his second game back from a bruised
right thigh.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are within three wins of the franchise record for
consecutive home victories set by the Rochester Royals in 1949-50.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, 27-1 at home, missed nine of their first 10 shots and
trailed 13-4 early. Washington made six of its first nine shots
before the Kings rallied.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 85, New Jersey 80--Jerry Stackhouse scored 22 points,
including six points and a steal during a 10-2 run in the final 2:37
that sealed the win for the Pistons at East Rutherford, N.J. Keith
Van Horn had 26 points for New Jersey, but he missed two free throws
with 15.1 seconds remaining and the Nets down three. Net forward
Kenyon Martin missed the second half after re-injuring his right
forearm.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 98, Philadelphia 91--Karl Malone had 26 points, 13 rebounds
and seven assists for the Jazz, which opened an 18-point lead in the
third quarter and was not threatened at Philadelphia. Allen Iverson
scored 34 points on nine-of-27 shooting for the 76ers. He missed his
first six shots and 11 of his first 12. Utah's Greg Ostertag returned
after serving a one-game suspension imposed by Coach Jerry Sloan.</TE>
<TE>   Denver 100, Memphis 85--Raef LaFrentz had 23 points, nine rebounds
and five blocked shots and the Nuggets had a 19-2 run in the fourth
quarter to take control at Memphis, Tenn. Lorenzen Wright scored 20
points for the Grizzlies in his first game since Dec. 6.</TE>

<LD>Rodney Buford of the Memphis Grizzlies, suspended for five games by
the NBA on Monday for violating its anti-drug rules, began his
suspension Thursday. In a statement released by the Grizzlies, Buford
said he did not fail a drug test.</LD>
<LD>   "I want everyone to understand that this suspension was not due to
a failed drug test," Buford said. "I was suspended because I was not
available to be contacted by league officials."</LD>
<LD>   Buford went on to apologize for the suspension and said he'd work
"to handle this situation in the best way possible."</LD>
<TE>   "Right now, I am heartbroken," Buford said. "I feel that I have
let everyone down with this suspension. Hopefully, I can be
forgiven."</TE>
<TE>   Memphis General Manager Billy Knight said: "We want to offer our
support to help him handle this situation at present and for the long
term."</TE>
<TE>   Buford was averaging 9.2 points and 4.1 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis activated center Lorenzen Wright, sidelined 33 games by a
broken bone below his knee. The Grizzlies put center Isaac Austin on
the injured list. He has tendinitis in his right knee.</TE>

<HD>McKay Prepares to Leave, Interviews for Atlanta Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tampa Bay General Manager Rich McKay took a big step toward leaving
the Buccaneers on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The embattled Bucs executive interviewed for the Atlanta Falcons'
GM job, a sign that he not only wants out, but that the sons of Tampa
Bay owner Malcolm Glazer are willing to release him from the final
year of his contract.</LD>
<LD>   McKay has been contemplating a move since last Friday when the
Glazers vetoed his plan to hire former Baltimore Raven assistant
Marvin Lewis as Tampa Bay's new coach.</LD>
<TE>   The Bucs have been searching for a replacement for Tony Dungy for
more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   McKay's departure would leave the team without a coach and general
manager, fueling speculation that the Glazers are setting themselves
up to make another run at luring Bill Parcells out of retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Parcells turned down an offer to take over the team on Jan. 18,
McKay made an unsuccessful bid to pry Jon Gruden from the Oakland
Raiders and Lewis' candidacy was squashed a day after he had been
told the job was his.</TE>
<TE>   McKay, who returned from Atlanta on Thursday night, declined
comment at Tampa International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The Glazers resumed the coaching search this week without input
for McKay, who teamed with Dungy to turn around a franchise suffered
through 12 consecutive seasons with 10 or more losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucs made the playoffs four of the past five seasons under
Dungy, who was fired against McKay's wishes on Jan. 14.</TE>

saying state taxpayers pay for the football stadium, so they should
get to watch the games on TV if they want. Washington taxpayers
contributed $300 million for the team's new stadium in downtown
Seattle.</TE>

<TE>   San Francisco 49er guard Ray Brown, who made the Pro Bowl last

his physical. Keith has been slow to recover from a season-ending
knee injury.... Rod Rust, one-time head coach of the New England
Patriots and defensive coordinator for the New York Giants in 1992,
has been hired again by the Giants as a defensive quality control
coach. Dave Brazil, who held that position last season, will become

<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes intensified his criticism of Mike Tyson
calling him a "sexual predator" and asking the Georgia Boxing
Commission to rescind his license to fight in the state.</TE>
<TE>   House Republicans introduced a resolution urging the commission
not to allow Tyson to fight in the Georgia Dome.</TE>
<TE>   Since being denied a boxing license Jan. 29 by the Nevada Athletic
Commission, Tyson's promoters have been looking for other sites for
the title bout against heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. Atlanta is
a candidate, along with Los Angeles, Colorado and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Josef Mason, director of Colorado's Office of Boxing,
denied a request by promoter Marty Garafalo for a permit to stage a
June 8 fight at Invesco Field at Mile High.</TE>
<TE>   A federal jury in New York awarded roughly $8 million in damages

<LD>The true Riviera renovation--the one that mattered most Thursday--had
nothing to do with lengthened holes, re-routed fairways or freshly
dug bunkers.</LD>
<LD>   This overhaul took place in Jesper Parnevik's hotel room.</LD>
<LD>   Parnevik, mired in one of the worst starts of his career, surged

adjustment to his swing.</LD>
<TE>   "I looked in the mirror of my hotel room last night, and I thought
I needed to rotate my hips," said Parnevik, who underwent hip surgery
two years ago. "It just freed up my whole swing. It's unbelievable.
I'm hitting it much straighter and about 30 yards farther."</TE>
<TE>   Straighter, farther and suddenly relevant, Parnevik is looking to
overcome a painfully slow start in which he is "pretty much doing
everything badly." He had four birdies Thursday and--for the first
time in a decade--two eagles to finish with a six-under-par 65 and a
one-shot lead over David Peoples, Billy Andrade, Toru Taniguchi and
Jose Maria Olazabal.</TE>
<TE>   The most noticeable change Parnevik made was switching to
cross-handed putting, something he tried on a lark Wednesday in a
pro-am round. He made a 20-foot putt that way, then refined his
reverse grip later that evening on the practice green.</TE>
<TE>   He stuck with it Thursday morning, making a 20-foot putt for eagle
on No. 1 and a 25-footer for birdie on No. 8. He chipped in for eagle
from 25 feet on No. 10.</TE>
<TE>   He wavered when standing over a 60-foot putt on No. 17 and briefly
considered switching back to his regular grip. He reconsidered,
though, and narrowly missed a cross-handed beauty. He made a
three-footer coming back for birdie.</TE>
<TE>   "When I stood up there cross-handed, everything seemed like it
fell in place," he said. "I could see where I was aiming, and the
stroke felt good. That's pretty much the way it was today."</TE>
<TE>   Parnevik nearly had company atop the leaderboard, but Olazabal
missed an eight-foot putt on No. 18 that would have given him a share
of the lead. He won the Buick Invitational at La Jolla last weekend
and made his ascent Thursday with four birdies on the back nine.</TE>
<TE>   Taniguchi had a bogey-free round and dropped to five under with a
birdie on No. 10. He finished his round with eight consecutive pars.</TE>
<TE>   Two shots off the lead are Tommy Armour III, Esteban Toledo, Brad
Faxon and David Duval, who is playing for the first time in three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   John Daly shot a 70, and a frustrated Sergio Garcia retired to the
practice green after shooting a 73.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds were noticeably smaller in the absence of Tiger Woods,
who decided to skip the tournament to recover from flu.</TE>
<TE>   "If Tiger was here, that would be that extra spice in the soup,"
Garcia said. "But I think you still have great players and you have
players that have been playing great."</TE>
<TE>   Play was suspended because of darkness at 5:50 p.m. with six
golfers on the course, none of whom were among the top 10. They will
finish their rounds this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike last year, when the tournament was plagued by heavy rains,
it was clear, cool and slightly breezy. That made for some very long
drives and lots of action on the slick greens.</TE>
<TE>   "It was playing really fast, and I like it like that," Toledo
said. "The greens are very hard, so you have to be in the fairway. I
was playing 15 yards short and bouncing the ball up."</TE>
<TE>   Parnevik had no complaints, considering he is 57th on the money
list ($133,100), and he missed the cut at Palm Springs and Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   This from a guy who has won at least one event in each of the last
four seasons and has topped $1 million in earnings for five
consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the slump.</TE>
<TE>   "It was to the point where I was putting in so much effort and
time," he said. "I was putting in 10, 12 hours a day and just wasn't
getting any results. [Wednesday] it just kind of clicked a little
bit, and that makes it so much more fun to play."</TE>
<TE>   He has played in all seven PGA Tour events this season, making a
bet with his caddie that he can go without a break until he wins.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at the way I played earlier this year," he said, "it
looked like it was going to be a very long year."</TE>
<TE>   Now, who knows? He has played well at Riviera in the past, tying
for 13th last year and finishing second to Kirk Triplett in 2000. For
the moment, Parnevik intends to stick with his new techniques. He had
a simple explanation for that:</TE>
<TE>   "When you're desperate, you're desperate."</TE>

<HD>No Victories, but Toledo Is a Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PETER YOON and THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Esteban Toledo has spent most of his life overcoming long odds, so
there is no reason to think he can't do it again this week. Toledo,
who opened with a four-under 67 Thursday and is two shots behind
leader Jesper Parnevik, has no victories and only seven top-10
finishes in 167 career PGA Tour starts.</LD>
<LD>   But for someone who grew up in a poor Mexican town, success is not
measured in victories. For a guy who used to hide in golf course
trees until the course closed so he could sneak on and play, just
being at Riviera is living a dream.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know how I got on the tour," Toledo said. "If you guys
saw where I came from, you wouldn't believe it. I came from
minus-zero to now. A lot of people understand the word rich, but they
don't understand the minus-zero. That's where I came from."</LD>
<TE>   Toledo, a former boxer who was 12-1 as a professional, is now a
tour player who has earned $2,205,330 since 1994 and, after
attempting qualifying school for 12 consecutive years starting in
1986, has kept his card for the last five years. He and his wife and
two children live in Costa Mesa, but he has built a home for his
sister in Mexico and plans on building a church in his hometown of
Mexicali.</TE>
<TE>   "A few people don't believe I'm here," Toledo said. "But it's
courage. The more they told me I couldn't make it, the harder I
worked."</TE>
<TE>   The hard work hasn't stopped. Toledo is a tour fixture, having
played a tour-high 36 tournaments last year. He has played at least
30 every year since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It's because I love the game, and that's it," Toledo said. "It
took me 10 years to get to this tour ... and I'm going to play as
much as I can until my body gives out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, Billy Andrade had no club deal, no cap deal and no bag
deal. He didn't even have his name on his bag.</TE>
<TE>   "I was basically naked," Andrade said.</TE>
<TE>   He's covered now, after signing a deal with Mizuno. Andrade said
he was dropped by Titleist, with whom he had been associated since
his first year as a pro in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "Numbers are numbers," he said. "Some people have to get cut and I
got cut."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't easy going it alone, said Andrade, who admitted his
endorsement problems affected his play. He hasn't made a cut in three
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "My season starts here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Ramina, Riviera's course superintendent, begins work a little
early: 4 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "We're starting grooming the course about three hours before the
first tee time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The greens are single-cut after each round and again in the
morning. Ramina said the rough, which is only two inches high, would
have been higher, but the weather didn't cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the first group off Thursday, David Peoples, Tommy Armour III
and Miguel Angel Jiminez should have zipped through the first round
at Riviera, but that wasn't the case. The threesome was warned twice
about slow play. It didn't seem to affect Peoples and Armour, who
shot 66 and 67, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We all made birdies when we were on the clock, so it worked,"
said Peoples, who begins the second round in a tie for second place.
"I didn't feel like we were playing slow, but as the first group, we
are supposed to set the pace."</TE>
<TE>   Peoples suggested that Jiminez, who shot 73, might have been to
blame for the slow play.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a little slower than Tommy and I," Peoples said. "But no
offense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brett Massingham, the pro at Marbella Country Club in San Juan
Capistrano who has multiple sclerosis, shot a 10-over 81.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't get caught up in the outcome," Massingham said. "I
needed to get caught up in the emotion. What a thrill for me. Five
years ago, I didn't know if I could get out of bed. And now I get to
play in a PGA Tour event?"</TE>

<LD>If Wednesday's training runs are any indication, the United States
will be in the medal chase with both its luge doubles teams today.</LD>
<LD>   The teams of Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin and Chris Thorpe and
Clay Ives turned in some of the top times at Utah Olympic Park.
Grimmette and Martin, bronze medalists at the Nagano Games, were the
fastest on the first run at 43.217 seconds and second-fastest in the
second run at 43.313. Thorpe and Ives were fastest starters both
times, with the day's best 3.048 on the second run. Thorpe, who won a
silver in Nagano with now-retired teammate Gordy Sheer, and Ives had
runs of 43.357, third best on the first run, and 43.485, fourth best
on the second.</LD>
<LD>   The most consistent sliders were Germans Patric-Fritz Leitner and
Alexander Resch, whose 43.210 was the best time of the day, .007
better than the first run by Grimmette and Martin.</LD>
<TE>   The American luge breakthrough came at Nagano. Before the silver
and bronze won there, all 87 medals awarded in the event went to four
nations--Germany, Austria, Italy and the Soviet Union.</TE>

<LD>The Chris Klug story will be closely followed, as the 31-year-old
snowboarder from Aspen, Colo., attempts to win a medal in men's
parallel giant slalom at Park City.</LD>
<LD>   Needing a liver transplant to save his life, Klug received a new
liver on July 28, 2000, and returned to competition a year later. He
was sixth in the world giant slalom in 2001, the best U.S. finish.</LD>
<LD>   At Nagano in '98, he was second after his first run, but he fell
to sixth after catching his arm in a gate.</LD>
<TE>   In Thursday's qualifying, Klug led American competitors in 11th
place, 1.48 seconds out of first place. His teammates, Jeff Greenwood
and Peter Thorndike, were 20th and 27th, out of the qualifying for
the final.</TE>
<TE>   The leader was Gilles Jaquet of Switzerland, with a time of 35.69,

the late game tonight, facing off against Finland and Teemu Selanne,
the former Ducks' star now with the San Jose Sharks.</LD>

Jeremy Roenick of the Philadelphia Flyers, Mike Modano of the Dallas
Stars and Brett Hull of the Detroit Red Wings.</LD>

Hockey Is Wide Open</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>If the United States has one advantage in the ultra-competitive men's
Olympic hockey tournament, it's supposed to be home ice.</LD>
<LD>   That's a misnomer. Home crowd? Yes. A couple of players already
have heard from the U.S. women's team about how loud and supportive
the fans have been.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we're going to see a lot of patriotism out there when we
step on the ice Friday night," goaltender Mike Dunham said. "It's
going to be a great hockey atmosphere."</LD>
<TE>   But the ice is foreign. The International Ice Hockey
Federation--which governs plays outside of the NHL--uses a rink that
is 15 feet wider than the North American standard</TE>
<TE>   "It's a built-in advantage for the Europeans," U.S. Coach Herb
Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much more room for a forward to create offense that
we're going to have to be on top of our defensive game," said forward
Bill Guerin, who plays for the Boston Bruins. "In the NHL, the ice is
a lot smaller and you can go out of your way to make a big hit
without getting burned. If we do that too many times, there's just
too much open space. If we run around and try to make big hits all
the time, there's more area for us to get burned."</TE>
<TE>   The Europeans who play in the NHL will have to make the adjustment
as well. But they'll be joining teammates who are accustomed to the
larger surface.</TE>
<TE>   If there's a pattern midway through the second Olympics to use NHL
players, it might be the fewer pros, the better. The Czech Republic
won the gold medal in 1998 with fewer NHL players than any other team
in Nagano. The two teams to advance out of preliminary-round play in
Salt Lake, Germany and Belarus, have only three NHL players between
them.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Super Six teams that join the action today--the
United States, Canada, Finland, Czech Republic, Russia and
Sweden--will try to create an instant chemistry after only one day of
practice. The talent is so evenly distributed that, "Anyone can win
this baby," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to come down to who's playing better as a
team," said Dunham, of the Nashville Predators. "Every team can
skate, every team has skill."</TE>
<TE>   The United States begins its gold medal quest today against a
Finland team led by San Jose Shark Teemu Selanne, Dallas Star Jere
Lehtinen and Carolina Hurricane Sami Kapanen.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said he is considering line combinations of St. Louis Blue
Doug Weight, Philadelphia Flyer John LeClair and Detroit Red Wing
Brett Hull, another of Guerin, Dallas Star Mike Modano and Chicago
Blackhawk Tony Amonte. He also is thinking about reuniting St. Louis'
Keith Tkachuk and Philadelphia's Jeremy Roenick, who were teammates
with the Phoenix Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are these NHL players will happily do whatever Brooks
says. They were all at that young, impressionable age when Brooks
coached the 1980 team to the gold medal in Lake Placid, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would have thought when I was 7 years old that I would be
playing for Herb Brooks?" Dunham said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunham recalled visiting Lake Placid for a youth hockey league
game that summer and peering through the windows of the darkened
arena at the site of the "Miracle on Ice."</TE>
<TE>   Others reenacted Mike Eruzione's winning goal against the Russians
in their basements. It was a pivotal moment in U.S. hockey</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge inspiration for me at that time and still is,"
Guerin said. "It's one of the big reasons I love the game and why I
really decided to pursue a career in the game."</TE>
<TE>   You could say this team is a direct descendant of the 1980
squad--and one of the last. Future teams will feature players who
were too young to vividly remember the 1980 gold medal, or hadn't
even been born yet.</TE>

<HD>Falling Down Doesn't Trip Up Muehlegg's Pursuit of His
Second Gold Medal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Johann Muehlegg's right ski plowed through the snow, throwing him off
balance and into the snow. But not even a face-first fall could knock
him off course Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Muehlegg dominated the men's cross-country pursuit event to win
his second gold medal of the Winter Games. He also won the 30K
freestyle race Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Norwegians Thomas Alsgaard and Frode Estil tied for the silver
medal. Alsgaard lunged his left ski forward at the finish line to
create the tie before falling to the ground. They waited several
minutes before getting the official decision.</LD>
<TE>   The event had little drama otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg, a German-born skier who sought and attained Spanish
citizenship after a 1998 dispute with the German ski federation,
covered the entire 20K event in 49 minutes, 20.4 seconds--28.5
seconds faster than the Norwegians.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the fastest skier or the best sprinter. But I have a good
motor," Muehlegg said.</TE>
<TE>   He also won the 30K freestyle in commanding fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg was so far in front Thursday that he slowed down to grab
a Spanish flag, carried it in his right hand for the final 100 meters
and waved it as he crossed the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Now it's finished; they cannot catch me,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both legs of the event were held on the same day for the first
time in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg took charge in each one. He won the 10K classic-style
race and gave himself a 13-second lead to begin the second leg of the
event, the 10K freestyle pursuit.</TE>

<DH>It Has Been 50 Years Since Edmonton Mercurys Won Country's
Last Gold</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Billy Dawe will be looking at the mantel over his fireplace a lot
more during these Winter Olympics, gazing at the 50-year-old memento
displayed at his home in Edmonton and wondering about the irony of it
all.</LD>
<LD>   He will be glued to his television set, rooting every rush down
the ice by the Canadian hockey team, pulling with all his heart that
the millionaire players on the ice will be able to finally have what
he has.</LD>
<LD>   He laughs ruefully at the thought of the likes of Mario Lemieux,
Rob Blake, Paul Kariya, Eric Lindros and Joe Sakic, NHL superstars
and members of Team Canada at the Salt Lake Games, not having it.
Same goes for previous Canadian superstars such as Bobby Hull,
Maurice Richard, Jean Beliveau and Wayne Gretzky.</LD>
<TE>   "It is inconceivable to me," Dawe said recently, from Edmonton,
"that it has been 50 years since a Canadian stood on that gold medal
stand and sang 'O! Canada.'"</TE>
<TE>   It is inconceivable to just about anybody with the slightest
knowledge of hockey and its origins that Canada has been shut out of
the Olympic gold medal since the 1952 Games in Oslo. Especially
considering that Canada won six of the first seven golds, one in
Antwerp in 1920 when hockey was part of the Summer Games. In 41
Olympic games between 1920 and 1952, Canada won 37 and lost only one,
with three ties. The Canadians scored 403 goals and gave up only 34,
and in the first actual Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, France,
outscored five opponents, 110-3.</TE>
<TE>   But starting with the 1956 Games in Cortina, Italy, the Soviets
took over, winning eight of the 10 golds in hockey through the '92
Games in Albertville, France. The exceptions: the two miracles on ice
when the host Americans won at Squaw Valley in '60 and at Lake Placid
in '80. Angered and frustrated by the Soviet hockey teams and their
apparent professional status, Canada pulled out of two
Olympics--Sapporo, Japan, in '72 and Innsbruck, Austria, in
'76--before returning.</TE>
<TE>   By the '94 Games in Lillehammer, Norway, the Soviet Union had
split up, but little good it did the Canadians. Sweden won the gold.</TE>
<TE>   Then, starting in '98 at Nagano, pros were welcomed to the hockey
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Dawe is 77. He was captain of the Edmonton Mercurys, a team
of amateurs that represented Canada in the 1952 Games. He scored six
goals and had six assists in eight games, helped the Mercurys win
what was then a predictable gold for Canada and stood on the victory
stand while they played "O! Canada," his country's moving national
anthem.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been 50 years, and I still have trouble describing what that
was like," Dawe said. "You have to be there, I guess. There were lots
of my teammates who were crying, and I bet there were probably a few
tears in my eyes too."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 16 Edmonton Mercury players, 12 are still alive. Gone are
George Abel, David Miller, Thomas Pollock and Robert Watt. Still
around to share the memories with Dawe and root for each ensuing
Canadian Olympic team are John Davies, Robert Dickson, Donald Gauf,
Billy Gibson, Ralph Hansch, Robert Meyers, Eric Paterson, Allan
Purvis, Gordon Robertson, Louis Secco and Francis Sullivan. Most are
well into their 70s.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a couple of lads in their 60s," Dawe said.</TE>
<TE>   In the days before professionals were allowed in the Olympics, the
Edmonton Mercurys typified the ideal. They played in the Senior
Central Alberta League by night, and most of them worked for the car
dealership that sponsored their hockey team during the day. That car
dealership is still there, run by Allan Purvis' son, with a few of
the players from the 1952 team still holding small shares of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   According to Dawe, the real hero of the '52 Olympics was the owner
of the dealership, Jim Christensen.</TE>
<TE>   When the Mercurys were at home, they would work a full day, then
get on a bus bought by Christensen and travel 100 miles or more to
play a game at night. Then they'd drive back, go home to sleep for a
few hours, and be back at work the next day. As they became a
national powerhouse, they represented Canada in world competition in
London in 1949 and '50, spending seven months touring Europe.
Christensen paid all those expenses, as well as for the team's
equipment. He also sent checks to the wives back home to keep them
going.</TE>
<TE>   "I would bet that Mr. Christensen spent around $100,000 on all
this, including getting us to the Olympics," Dawe said. "And that was
a lot of money in those days."</TE>
<TE>   Dawe said that Christensen accompanied his team to Oslo, watched
all the games and returned home with the group. But he had come down
with a virus in Norway and died shortly after returning.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I have been to a lot of hockey hall of fames, and I
wish I'd see more pictures in some of them of Mr. Christensen," Dawe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dawe said that, in the early '50s, with six teams in the NHL and
joining them only a distant dream to even the top echelon of hockey
players in Canada, the Olympics were as good as it got. Also, if you
were playing for Canada, as big a pressure-cooker as you could find.</TE>
<TE>   "When we got there, we expected it to be like the world
championships," Dawe said. "We had been through that, and we thought
we were ready for everything. But when we arrived, we saw that
everything was bigger, fancier. Right away, I had the sweaty palms
and the nervous twits.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the clear favorites. We were the Canadians. But I'll tell
you, I was sure glad when that last whistle blew and our flag went up
and they played 'O! Canada.' You play these games and anything can
happen in 60 minutes. Hockey is a slippery game on a slippery
surface."</TE>
<TE>   Dawe was 28 when he returned from the Olympics. The team took one
celebratory trip years later to Ottawa, where it was honored by
then-Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.</TE>
<TE>   "We had kind of a receiving line," Dawe recalled, "and when the
prime minister got to me, he asked if I still played hockey. I told
him that I had retired, that I had set my sights on my goal, had
reached it, and it was time to retire. He stopped and laughed and
said, 'That's a great thought. Maybe I should talk to my cabinet
about that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Dawe said that the Mercurys were pretty much a forgotten story
until the Olympics came to Canada with the Calgary Games of 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, every four years, when the Winter Games come around, we get
all sorts of invitations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the invitations are many from junior high schools, where
Dawe invariably is asked to show the gold medal he won. So he takes
it off the mantel, does some show-and-tell for the youngsters, passes
the medal around for all to see and answers questions.</TE>
<TE>   The one he gets the most: "How much is the medal worth?"</TE>
<TE>   Dawe's answer is always the same, along the lines of the current
TV commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Priceless.</TE>

<HD>More Judges Are Under Fire</HD>
<DH>In an event where the credibility of the results have long
been questioned, a report from Canada says medal winners have been
predetermined.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>If you thought judging of the pairs figure skating competition was
unfathomable and unfair, wait until ice dancing.</LD>
<LD>   The most scorned of the four Olympic figure skating disciplines,
ice dancing has one edge over the pairs competition: It has been
embroiled in more judging scandals.</LD>
<LD>   While the International Skating Union continues an internal
investigation into allegations a French judge was pressured to vote
for the Russians over a Canadian couple Monday in the pairs long
program, a new controversy was already brewing in ice dancing, which
begins tonight with the compulsory dances at the Salt Lake Ice
Center.</LD>
<TE>   The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, cited unnamed sources
this week in reporting ice dance judges had predetermined the outcome
of their event by penciling in couples from Italy, Russia, France,
Lithuania and Canada--in that order--for the first five spots.</TE>
<TE>   ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta declined to address the report,
but cautioned that there was no evidence that the outcome of the
pairs judging will have a bearing on subsequent events at these
Games.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot jump from one situation to the other on the basis of
allegations without any proof so far," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about the sport's credibility led Dick Pound, an
influential IOC member from Canada, to recently suggest that ice
dancing could be dropped as an Olympic event if its embarrassing
judging scandals continued.</TE>
<TE>   "The competitions are won on the ice and not in clandestine
meetings before the event takes place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although allegations of improprieties in the voting that gave
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia the pairs gold
medal over Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada were of recent
vintage, ice dancing has long been muddied by accusations of
misconduct by judges.</TE>
<TE>   The standings rarely change from the compulsory dances, worth 20%
of the final score, to the original dance, worth 30%, to the final
phase, the free dance, worth 50% of the overall score.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult for spectators to see what's being evaluated, since
there are no lifts or throws, as there are in pair skating, and the
often outlandish costumes and melodramatic music overshadow the
skaters' performances, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   Among the accusations ice dancing has faced are that judges
determined the results before the competition, voted in blocks,
exchanged favors, or illegally communicated with each other during
competitions via hand signals.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1992 Albertville Games, irregularities in the judging were
said to have sealed a victory by Russia's Marina Klimova and Sergei
Ponomarenko over siblings Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay of France. A
judge who bemoaned his exclusion from the dance panel was quoted as
saying: "That's the easy one. Those judges mailed in their marks last
May."</TE>
<TE>   Judges have been suspended by the ISU for improper actions.
However, so was whistleblower Jean Senft, a Canadian who suspected
collusion among judges before the 1998 Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   Senft taped a phone call from Ukranian judge Yuri Balkov in which
Balkov listed the placements he planned to give each couple in the
free dance at Nagano. Senft played the tape as evidence at an ISU
hearing. Balkov was banned for one year as a result. But Senft
accuses skating officials of retaliating against her by suspending
him for six months for allegedly favoring a Canadian duo at the Grand
Prix and Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian ice dancers Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz, who
finished fourth at Nagano, claimed they were victims of a conspiracy
by judges from France and Russia to keep them out of the medals. The
bronze medalists, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, are from
France; Anissina, however, is a native of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Reforms were instituted after Nagano to stipulate requirements and
deductions for each portion of the competition. However, those
reforms appear to have accomplished little, critics said.</TE>
<TE>   Debate over the effects of politicking by coaches and judges was
rekindled at the world championships last March at Vancouver, Canada,
when Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy defeated
Anissina and Peizerat, who had skated a more animated and appealing
free dance.</TE>
<TE>   The ice dance judging here is sure to receive special scrutiny
while the pairs mess still simmers.</TE>
<TE>   The draw for the Olympic ice dance panel was held in early
November. The chosen country's skating federation then nominated a
total of nine judges and one alternate. The 10 countries were Russia,
Ukraine, Italy, Israel, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Germany, Poland,
Switzerland and Lithuania.</TE>
<TE>   The referee will be Alexander Gorshkov of Russia, a former ice
dancer who is chairman of the ISU's dance technical committee.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Tchernyshev, who teamed with Naomi Lang to win their fourth
consecutive U.S. pairs title last month, said he believes the panel
will be impartial.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the controversy will not compromise the ice dance
event," he said. "We believe the ice dance judges will remember the
oaths they have taken at the opening ceremony and we believe ice
dance will be judged fairly."The red-haired Anissina and lion-maned
Peizerat are slight favorites, based on their victories over
Fusar-Poli and Margaglio at the European championships. They lost to
Bourne and Kraatz at the Grand Prix Final after having defeated the
Canadians at the Trophee Lalique competition.</TE>

<DH>Russian gets four perfect scores and holds off bitter rival
Plushenko for the gold. Goebel wins bronze on a night when
competition overshadows controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>He kissed the ice with his tears and his lips, releasing the tension
and doubts that had percolated within him for years.</LD>
<LD>   Alexei Yagudin, a son of Russia who left his homeland to refine
his remarkable figure skating talents in the United States, straddled
the gap between two cultures Thursday with a majestic performance. He
earned an Olympic-record four perfect 6.0s for presentation and a
gold medal--not to mention the affection of the roaring crowd at the
Salt Lake Ice Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I was like in a fog," he said of his emotions when he saw his
scores and realized he had beaten his former rinkmate and
still-bitter rival, Evgeni Plushenko. "I don't remember what
happened.... It was like some dream up there."</LD>
<TE>   Yagudin's "Man in the Iron Mask" free skating program blended two
soaring quadruple jumps and six triples with nimble footwork and
showmanship of a born performer. Plushenko, who ended Yagudin's
three-year reign as world champion last March, moved up from fourth
after the short program to second with a rendition of "Carmen" that
incorporated two quads and six triples.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Goebel, who moved to El Segundo nearly two years ago to
train with coach Frank Carroll, made Olympic history by landing three
quads in his "American in Paris" program and finished third, held
back only by presentation scores that included two 5.4s and one 5.5.
His bronze medal was the first by a male U.S. figure skater since
Paul Wylie won a silver medal at the 1992 Albertville Games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," said Goebel, who skated fourth in the final
group of six. "The waiting is the worst part. It's easy to go out
there and skate.</TE>
<TE>   "People always talk about how they dream about the Olympics, but
to be there and be on the podium, I can't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Takeshi Honda of Japan, second after the short program, dropped to
fourth. Alexander Abt of Russia, who trains at Lake Arrowhead,
finished a creditable fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Six-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, ninth after the short
program, moved up to sixth in his third and final Olympic appearance.
Two-time U.S. champ Michael Weiss, eighth after the short program,
moved up a notch to seventh, powered by the first quadruple to
loop-triple toe loop-double loop combination jump of his career.</TE>
<TE>   In a welcome change, there was no controversy over the judges'
marks, as there was Monday in the pairs event. Carroll wasn't happy
with those 5.4s, but neither he nor Goebel could quibble with the
placements.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so excited to be sitting here with a medal around my
neck," Goebel said. "At the Grand Prix Final [where he finished third
behind Yagudin and Plushenko] I knew I had the potential to be up
here with these two gentlemen.</TE>
<TE>   "I prepared really hard, and it showed."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin was graceful in victory, but he was less than gracious
toward his old coach, Alexei Mishin.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin left Mishin four years ago to train in Connecticut with
Tatiana Tarasova, convinced Mishin lost faith in him and devoted more
attention to Plushenko than to him. They have never healed that rift,
and Yagudin seemed to deepen it when he gestured toward Mishin and
said, "I hear I'm not such a good skater from that side," in
discussing his old doubts and fears.</TE>
<TE>   Mishin later made peace overtures by saying he was "proud of my
two skaters, one current and one former," but Yagudin promptly
grabbed the microphone at the post-event news conference and stomped
on that olive branch.</TE>
<TE>   "Four years ago I started to work with Tatiana and nobody believed
I could be on the podium again," said Yagudin, the third Russian man
in a row to win Olympic gold and fourth in a row from the former
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "She helped me. The gold medal just belongs to me and Tatiana and
the people who are around us."</TE>
<TE>   The final skater, Yagudin, 21, showed no nervousness in landing a
quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop-double loop combination as his
first jump. He reeled off another quad and six triples, earning 5.9s
across the board for technical merit and five 5.9s to go with his
6.0s for presentation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really fortunate I had such a nice coach as Tatiana
Tarasova, who really changed me," he said. "I became not just a
jumper but an artist on the ice."</TE>
<TE>   Plushenko and Yagudin never looked at each other during the news
conference. Through a translator, Plushenko said he was "very
satisfied to get the silver medal. ... I did my personal best, but
Alexei gave a splendid performance."</TE>
<TE>   For once, no arguments there.</TE>

<LD>Three years ago, at the height of the Salt Lake bid scandal, the
president of John Hancock financial services was one of the
International Olympic Committee's most vocal critics.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, David D'Alessandro signed a contract re-upping
Hancock for another four years--from 2004 through 2008--as one of the
IOC's top sponsors. The deal reportedly is worth $60-$65 million.</LD>
<LD>   Hancock earlier had signed an extension for its sponsorship
through the Athens Summer Games in 2004. The new deal will run
through the Winter Olympics in 2006, in Turin, Italy, and the Summer
Games of 2008 in Beijing.</LD>

<TE>   The jumping half of the Nordic combined team event was postponed
Thursday, after officials decided that swirling winds on the small
hill at Olympic Park would have made for an unfair competition.</TE>
<TE>   The jumping was rescheduled for Saturday, with the second half of
the event--the 20-kilometer relay cross-country race on the Soldier
Hollow course--set for Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   More than 19,000 tickets were sold to the event.</TE>

<TE>   After watching a Venezuelan female luger crash once in competition
and four times in six training runs, International Luge Federation
President Josef Fendt has called for tighter qualification standards
for Olympic luge competitors.</TE>
<TE>   On her first run during Monday's women's luge finals, Iginia
Boccalandro fell off her sled between curves 13 and 14 and could have
been hit on the head by the 50-pound sled is not for prompt action by
trackside workers. One volunteer who helped stop the runaway sled
lost the tip of a finger in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "We must prevent excesses like these," Fendt said. "We still have
to figure out how to address this, but it's clear that we must do
something."</TE>

<HD>Outcome Leaves No Debate, Thank Quad</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A brief history of the quad:</LD>
<LD>   First Quad: Adam and Eve had a couple of sons named Cain and Abel.
Lasted until Cain developed the first recorded case of sibling
rivalry.</LD>
<LD>   Fab Quad: Lovable mop-tops from Liverpool who took the pop music
world by storm in 1964. Lasted until the lads really got to know
Yoko.</LD>
<TE>   Fearsome Quad: Famous defensive line for the Los Angeles Rams
during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Lasted until their quads and
their calves and their knees gave out.</TE>
<TE>   Final Quad: The biggest event in American college basketball.
Slightly misnamed. Because there's a Final Quad every year,
technically speaking, there will never really be a Final Quad. At
least not until the first sighting of the Quad Horsemen of the
Apocalypse.</TE>
<TE>   Quad Toe Loop: The first quadruple jump landed by a male figure
skater in competition. Pioneered by Canadian Kurt Browning in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Quad Salchow: Another quadruple jump, taken off from the back
inside edge of one foot and landed on the back outside edge of the
other foot. Pioneered by American Timothy Goebel in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Quad Sixes: The four perfect scores of 6.0 given Russia's Alexei
Yagudin for his gold-medal winning free skate Thursday night, which
were immediately subjected to the Quadruple Guess, also known as the
Second Guess Times Two, pioneered by the pairs judges and the
international media at the 2002 Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the Russian pair scored a controversial victory over
the Canadian pair, every move by every figure skating judge in Salt
Lake has been double-checked, triple-checked, quadruple-checked. And
look at these latest results:</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin and countryman Evgeni Plushenko finished 1-2, the first
time Russian men have won the figure skating gold and silver medals
at the Olympic Games, despite the fact American Timothy Goebel
out-quadded them both. Hmmm.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin became the first individual skater in the history of the
Winter Olympics to receive more than two scores of 6.0, even though
he skated more conservatively than Plushenko, taking care to avoid
serious error and protect the lead he held coming out of the short
program. Hmmm.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, eyes turned to the scoreboard and the nationalities
of the judges doling out the perfect scores. Another case of Eastern
bloc voting and bias?</TE>
<TE>   Let's see. The four 6.0 scores were handed out by the judge from
Romania ... and the judge from the Czech Republic ... and the judge
from Germany ...</TE>
<TE>   And the judge from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The same U.S. judge who also ranked Goebel, who hit three quads
but lacks the artistic polish of Yagudin and Plushenko, behind both
Russians.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Goebel wasn't whining, complaining or filing a
protest. Just glad to be on the podium, said the very happy
21-year-old. Just glad to have a medal of any color.</TE>
<TE>   Plushenko didn't look too pleased, but he never does when he steps
inside the same area code as Yagudin, his bitter rival. This one had
to be tough for the young Russian to take--watching Yagudin hop up
and down on the top step of the podium, punching the air in a fit of
delight. Watching the scene while he fingered his own silver medal,
Plushenko looked like Peter Tork the minute he heard the news the
Monkees' TV show had been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Also worth noting: There was no French judge on the panel Thursday
night. Maybe that's the way to curb these figure skating judging
scandals: Keep the French away from the ice.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, maybe we've all made too much of the pairs
judging controversy. The hometown paper here, the Salt Lake Tribune,
is publishing a daily special section on the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's was 16 pages. Swiss ski jumper Simon Ammann was on the
cover, followed on the inside pages by stories on giant slalom,
snowboarding, Alpine combined skiing, women's speedskating, men's
speedskating, women's biathlon, men's biathlon, cross-country skiing,
men's hockey and women's hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, on the bottom of Page 11, tucked beneath a story on
women's luge and alongside a story on curling was the first mention
of the pairs judging controversy. Hmmm. You can look at this one of
two ways: Either the Salt Lake Tribune editors have a better handle
on the big picture that the rest of us, or they have an edict to
emphasize the positive (i.e., the amazing feats of Olympic champions)
over the negative (i.e., unseemly judging scandals) during Games that
are so important to Salt Lake's self-image.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the Tribune would appear to have an ally in Ivan
Lebedev, a Washington correspondent for the Russian news agency Tass.
In Thursday's Washington Post, Lebedev wrote, "The [International
Skating Union] said in its statement that it decided to do [an
internal] assessment following the reaction of the public and media.
I'd like to ask the question, 'What public? What media?' As far as I
know, the Russian public and the Russian press are not complaining
about the results. The comments of the European newspapers were much
more balanced than those of the North American press."</TE>
<TE>   Lebedev also wrote that the pairs medals "have been correctly
awarded to the victors." Imagine that. Tass comes out in support of
the Russian pair! Film at 11!</TE>
<TE>   This just in: Tass also agrees with the scoring of the men's
figure skating competition.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>This was the skating you remember.</LD>
<LD>   This was the twirls on the pond, the leaps over the snow, the
daring, the joy.</LD>
<LD>   Four days after staggering into the Olympics unshaven and with
scandal on its breath, figure skating emerged Thursday in a clean
shirt and smile.</LD>
<TE>   As impossible as it once seemed, they held a men's long program
without controversy, without allegations, without shame.</TE>
<TE>   There was a winner who kissed the ice and wept during the scores.</TE>
<TE>   There was a runner-up who skipped and posed and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   There was a kid who became the first Olympic skater to complete
three quadruple jumps, yet still finished third, yet didn't complain
once.</TE>
<TE>   There were thousands who cheered every skater, for every move,
embracing the Russians as tightly as the Americans, as warmly as the
Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   And there was a handshake.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it could all be explained by this handshake.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you didn't see it. These days, people don't look for that
sort of thing in figure skating unless the hands are changing money
for votes that are being swapped.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't involve Russian winner Alexei Yagudin, or Russian
runner-up Evgeni Plushenko, or third-place finisher Timothy Goebel of
HealthSouth Training Center.</TE>
<TE>   The hands were older, more calloused.</TE>
<TE>   One belonged to American Todd Eldredge.</TE>
<TE>   The other belonged to Canadian Elvis Stojko.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge, 30, was leaving the ice after his third and final
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Stojko, 29, was entering the ice for his fourth and final
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Usually competitors in this situation quickly skate past each
other.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, Stojko stopped. Eldredge stopped. They clasped
hands. They shared a glance.</TE>
<TE>   The only two male skaters recognized by casual skating fans were
realizing the importance of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Said Eldredge later: "We've been together 12 years. There's a lot
there."</TE>
<TE>   Said Stojko: "We've been through the same ups and downs. We
understand.''</TE>
<TE>   What they both understood Thursday is what everyone has forgotten
during the few brutal days of the pairs judging controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a big cloud hanging over the games, but skating is not
about that, the Olympics are not about that," Stojko said. "Yeah, I
thought our Canadian pairs team outskated the Russian team, but I had
tears in my eyes during both performances.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's focus has become so much on results, everybody is
forgetting to appreciate the effort of someone just doing their
best."</TE>
<TE>   So the two "old" guys started Thursday's drama by doing just that.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin became the first male skater in Olympic history to receive
more than two perfect 6.0 scores, as he received four perfect scores
for presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Yet nobody grabbed the moment and the crowd like Eldredge.</TE>
<TE>   Plushenko, in a funky matador outfit with flowing blond hair,
revealed a toughness that pushed him from fourth place to second.</TE>
<TE>   Yet nobody showed more soul than Stojko.</TE>
<TE>   "Lot of these young skaters, they get on the wave, ride it to the
top, then find something else to do," Stojko. "There's something
special in hanging in there when the wave hits bottom, and riding it
until it ends."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ride began with Eldredge, America's annual big-event
disappointment who started the night in ninth place.</TE>
<TE>   He opened his program by attempting his elusive quad, just moments
after hitting it in warmups.</TE>
<TE>   It eluded him again.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't stop skating and finished with a rousing, spinning
performance that would have earned him a medal four years ago in
Nagano, and moved him up to sixth place here.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you say, give him credit for putting it all on the line
and going for it," said his coach, Richard Callaghan.</TE>
<TE>   The fans agreed, giving him a lingering, standing ovation under
which he stood with a dazed smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the most important thing is not to win a medal," said
Eldredge, who never won one. "Maybe the most important thing is to
enjoy myself, and tonight, I did that."</TE>
<TE>   Next up, Stojko, who has struggled physically as Eldredge has
struggled mentally. His various injuries have prevented him from
remaining the same skater that has won two Olympic silver medals.</TE>
<TE>   "But I still did those two quads right away," he said with a
laugh. "I'm proud that I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   The quads were sharp, but his trademark martial arts moves
weren't. He dropped from seventh to eighth place.</TE>
<TE>   But the crowd thanked him anyway, with an ovation that sounded
like a loud goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   After which, Stojko scored a 6.0 for insight.</TE>
<TE>   "People forget, this sport is bigger than all of us," he said.
"You will eventually drop out, somebody will take your place, and the
sport will continue.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is to do the most with the time you have
here. Make a difference with that time. That's what it's all about."</TE>
<TE>   Before Eldredge and Stojko skated Thursday, two fans in the stands
held up adjoining signs.</TE>
<TE>   Drug Test the Athletes. Polygraph the Judges.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they had finished, if only for this night, if only for
as long as that handshake, the signs had disappeared.</TE>

<HD>Historic Victory May Sweep Away 'Outlaw' Image</HD>
<DH>Snowboarding, already growing at a fast pace, is likely to
become even more popular after the U.S. domination of the halfpipe
competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WRIGHTWOOD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Their historic sweep occurred four days ago and about 700 miles away,
on a halfpipe cut into the slopes of Utah's Park City Mountain
Resort. But the electrifying performances of U.S. Olympic
snowboarders Ross Powers, Danny Kass and Jarret [J.J.] Thomas remain
fresh in the minds and hearts of riders across the land.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired in part by gold- , silver- and bronze-winning
performances Monday before an international audience of millions,
snowboarders young and old took to the slopes this week brimming with
national pride and ready to put on skillful and courageous displays
of their own.</LD>
<LD>   "This is my first time, and I'm really bad at it," said
11-year-old Wallis Anawalt of Pasadena, from the bottom of a Mountain
High run called Cruiser. "I crawled all the way down."</LD>
<TE>   But then she and her friend, 12-year-old Angela Pascal of Los
Feliz, boldly rode the chair back up for another try.</TE>
<TE>   Young and Old Riders Have New Enthusiasm</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Keith Hudgson, 50, from Lake Forest, was taking a
breather. A longtime skier, he said watching Olympic snowboarding
this week prompted him to finally trade two planks for one.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't be doing somersaults in the halfpipe like those guys or
anything, but it's a lot of fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And so it went on a brisk and sunny midweek day at the biggest
resort in this small town in the San Gabriel Mountains. Outnumbering
skiers by about 8 to 1, snowboarders of all ages and abilities were
getting a jump on what figures to be a very crowded three-day holiday
weekend, riding the mountain and enjoying a vicarious thrill or two
along the way.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be there one day," Erin Long, 25, of El Cajon, said of
the Olympics. "I would love to be able to jump like that."</TE>
<TE>   The sweep, a first in Olympic snowboarding, has fans of the sport
hopeful that stereotypes of snowboarders as rebellious,
anti-establishment types will be quashed.</TE>
<TE>   The stereotype was reinforced when snowboarding made its Olympic
debut in the 1998 Games at Nagano, Japan. Some of the world's top
riders shunned the Games, prompting the same attitude among many of
their followers. It didn't help that Canada's Ross Rebagliati, winner
of the giant slalom, was temporarily stripped of his gold medal after
testing positive for marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, with the sport four years older and its top
athletes seemingly a good deal more mature, there seems to be a fresh
attitude about Olympic snowboarding. That became especially apparent
by the men's sweep, which came a day after American Kelly Clark won
gold in the women's halfpipe.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the parents will be getting more excited about the sport,"
said Mike Griffith, a longtime rider from Newport Beach. "They're not
going to shove a board on and dive into the halfpipe, but they're
going to be more willing to spend money on the children and even try
it themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Several local snowboarders said it was about time an "outlaw"
sport hit the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's cool to see the sport take a front seat," said John
Wade, 27, of Monrovia. "To have the Americans take all the medals
like that makes a statement, although I did like that guy from
Finland [Heikki Sorsa] wearing a Mohawk."</TE>
<TE>   Equally impressed was John Leavitt, 34, a serviceman stationed
with Long at the U.S. Navy base in San Diego. "It blows me away," he
said. "I've surfed all of my life, and that sport never quite made it
into the mainstream. Then snowboarding came along, turned into an
Olympic sport and now we pull off a sweep? That's pretty amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Though only a beginner, Anawalt said she wouldn't be surprised to
see snowboarding someday become more popular than skateboarding,
another favorite among America's youth.</TE>
<TE>   From 1995 to 2000, skateboarding and snowboarding were the
fastest-growing sports for boys ages 7 to 17, according to the
National Sporting Goods Assn. Respectively, they experienced
increases of 129.5% and 119.3%. In the same span, golf participation
increased 31.6% and basketball, baseball and football experienced
declines.</TE>
<TE>   From 1990 to 2000, snowboarding increased from 1.5 million
participants to 4.3 million, a jump of about 187%.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding's rise in popularity helped revitalize a ski industry
that was stagnant in the mid-1990s. Nationally, snowboarders make up
43% of the people on the slopes on a given day. And in Southern
California, they are 55% to 60% of the client base, according to Bob
Roberts, executive director of the California Ski Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Before, X Games Helped Popularize the Sport</TE>
<TE>   At Mountain High this season, snowboarders at times make up as
much as 95% of the clientele, resort officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding's growth can in part be attributed to ESPN's Winter X
Games, which since 1997 have provided a stage for new-age athletic
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Olympics have come along to provide an even larger and
more illuminant spotlight, and making the most of their moments were
Powers, Kass and Thomas, whose celebrity status is already beginning
to expand well beyond the snowboarding community.</TE>
<TE>   There they were schmoozing with the rock band Foo Fighters before
Monday's medal ceremony. On Tuesday, their agents were busy lining up
appointments with hosts of morning and late-night talk shows. In the
coming weeks, they are likely to be asked to sell much more than
snowboards, boots and other apparel.</TE>
<TE>   Which is highly worrisome to many within snowboarding's close-knit
fraternity, who are afraid that the grass-roots sport they've long
been so passionate about might soon be swallowed up by corporate
America.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my biggest fear," said Todd Richards, 32, a veteran pro
from Encinitas. "With the sweep and all the hype I hope these guys
don't get roped into endorsing things they don't even believe in.</TE>
<TE>   "What concerns me is that I might see them in some crazy shampoo
commercial or something, using that random, crazy lingo they all
think we all use."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Loses Its Timing</HD>
<DH>Only one American man and woman advance out of the
preliminary rounds of the parallel giant slalom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>It figured that it would be all but impossible for the U.S. snowboard
slalom racers to meet or better the standard set by the American
halfpipe riders, who earlier this week won four Olympic medals, two
of them gold.</LD>
<LD>   And they didn't.</LD>
<LD>   In racing dominated by Europeans, only one American man, Chris
Klug, and a sole American woman, Lisa Kosglow, advanced out of
Thursday's preliminary rounds to today's parallel giant slalom
finals. Four Austrians and three Swedes qualified on the men's side;
on the women's, three from France, four from Italy.</LD>
<TE>   Klug, 29, of Aspen, Colo., who only 18 months ago underwent a
liver transplant, finished 11th Thursday; Kosglow, 28, of Boise,
Idaho, who has an extensive injury history but remains such an
aggressive rider she's known as "Kozilla," came in seventh. Both are
making their second Olympic appearances; Klug finished sixth at the
Nagano Games in 1998, Kosglow 27th.</TE>
<TE>   Racing Thursday was against the clock--top 16 in, everyone else
out. Today's races will be head to head--two competitors racing
against each other down the course, winner keeps going, loser is out,
men against the other men, women versus women.</TE>
<TE>   Gilles Jaquet of Switzerland, whose painted helmet features a
surfer on one side and a bikini-clad woman face-down in the sand on
the other, emerged as the favorite in the men's event. He finished
first Thursday, in 35.69 seconds. "I'm not one who can do a really
safe run," he said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Second, at 36.28, was Austria's Alexander Maier, younger brother
of Hermann--the Herminator, the fearsome skiing machine who dominated
the Alpine events at Nagano. Older brother Hermann, injured and
unable to compete at the Salt Lake Olympics, called younger brother
Alex on Wednesday night with some tips. What were they? "I tell you
after the race [today]," Alex said. "They are too strong."</TE>
<TE>   Third was Daniel Biveson of Sweden. In women's racing, favorite
Karine Ruby of France posted the second-best qualifying time, 41.45,
just .01 of a second behind Maria Kirchgasser of Austria. Lidia
Trettel of Italy came in third, at 41.94.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's racing served primarily to thin the field--30 women and
32 men started Thursday--and to establish seedings for the finals.
Just as in the early regional rounds of the NCAA basketball
tournament, No. 1 will square off against No. 16, No. 2 against No.
15, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Kosglow, seeded seventh, has been sidelined over the years by a
broken back, fractured pelvis, two broken elbows, smashed left foot
joint, broken right ankle, broken right wrist and a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in her knee.</TE>
<TE>   She said of today's racing, "My only plan is to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Klug, cheered on Thursday by 57 family members and a pack of
friends, arrived at the starting gate as one of the heartwarming
stories of the Games. Virtually every major media outlet in the
United States has done a story about how he was diagnosed with liver
disease and needed a transplant.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the race couldn't have been more appropriate.
Thursday was not just Valentine's Day, it was also National Donor
Day, designed to raise awareness of the benefits of organ donation.</TE>
<TE>   Klug took the opportunity to pay tribute to the family of the
13-year-old boy whose liver he received in a July 2000 operation; the
boy had been shot in the head and left brain-dead by a 14-year-old
neighbor in what was later described as an accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm lucky to be here today," Klug said after Thursday's race,
calling the donor family "the real heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Klug drew bib No. 1, meaning that he would be first down the
course, and after a tentative start, he picked up speed and finished
in 37.17. Then he had to wait to see if he would make the top 16,
"having a little bit of a heart attack," as he put it.</TE>
<TE>   The other members of the U.S. men's and women's teams saw their
Olympic dreams end in less than a minute. Jeff Greenwood and Peter
Thorndike finished 20th and 27th, respectively. On the women's side,
Sondra Van Ert finished 17th, Rosey Fletcher 26th and Lisa Odynski
27th.</TE>
<TE>   Van Ert, still racing at a world-class level at age 37, said
afterward, "I sure wish I still got to play [today]."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood, meantime, acknowledged that the halfpipe team "was a
tough act to follow." He also said, "It did cross my mind: How are
you going to follow that?"</TE>

<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Janica Kostelic is so famous back home in Croatia she has her own
postage stamp, so you wonder what they'll do now that she has won her
country's first Winter Olympic medal.</LD>
<LD>   Kostelic limped into these Olympics with more injuries than a
10-year NFL lineman, yet it didn't stop her from winning gold
Thursday in the women's combined event.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first real Croatian medal," she said, "so I'm real
proud of it."</LD>
<TE>   Because of poor weather, the two slalom runs were run first and a
shortened downhill followed in the afternoon, the opposite format of
Wednesday's men's combined.</TE>
<TE>   It forced Kostelic, known more as a gate racer, to lay down two
fast slalom runs and hope she could ski a fast enough downhill to
hold off the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic, 20, surprised herself by posting the third-fastest
downhill time and easily won the event with a three-race time of 2
minutes 43:28 seconds, a healthy 1.49 seconds faster than silver
medalist Renate Goetschl of Austria. Germany's Martina Ertl took the
bronze with a time of 2:45.16.</TE>
<TE>   "Janica was unbeatable today," said Goetschl, who won the bronze
in the women's downhill on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey C. Kildow, a 17-year-old from Vail, Colo., was the highest
American finisher at sixth, a somewhat shocking result for a high
school junior who came to Salt Lake to get experience.</TE>
<TE>   Kildow is so young she sticks reminder notes on her skis. She
scribbled the words "Be determined" on one ski and "Focus and Attack"
on the other.</TE>
<TE>   No, she didn't use a heart to dot the "i" in the word
"determined."</TE>
<TE>   Kildow did admit she had to give up quite a bit to reach this
Olympic dream.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to go to the prom and things like that but I can't, and
that's kind of tragic," Kildow said. "But that's my life and I like
it."</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic knows that drill. She was only 16 when she finished
eighth in combined at the 1998 Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic is no stranger to victory stands, winning the World Cup
overall title last year and eight consecutive slaloms in one stretch,
but three operations on her left knee since spring made many wonder
whether she'd be a factor at these Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic answered that question resoundingly, although she said
she is far from 100%.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not healthy," she said. "I just say my right arm is OK, and
my hair is good too."</TE>
<TE>   With her win in combined, Kostelic must now be considered a medal
contender in all three remaining disciplines: super-giant slalom,
giant slalom and slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Janica may not be the only Kostelic to win a medal here, either.</TE>
<TE>   Ivica, her older brother, will be Bode Miller's biggest threat in
slalom next week.</TE>
<TE>   Ivica came from the 64th spot to win a World Cup slalom at Aspen,
Colo., in November and he, not Miller, is the current World Cup
leader in slalom.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he is proud of me," Janica said of her brother, who has
not arrived in Salt Lake. "It's going to be nice if he wins a medal
in slalom. That's everything we need."</TE>
<TE>   It was another crushing day of competition for American Caroline
Lalive, who continues her string of failures in international
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive, who crashed in Tuesday's Olympic downhill, withdrew from
the combined after her first slalom run after ending up 17.85 seconds
behind the first-run leader Kostelic.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive was so slow because she missed a gate on the course and had
to sidestep up the hill to retrace her tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive, 22, left the corral without comment but left plenty of
ammunition for commentary.</TE>
<TE>   She was considered the next rising star on the U.S. team after
finishing seventh in the Olympic combined at the 1998 Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in big races, nothing has gone right since she finished a
super-giant slalom at the 1999 Alpine World Championships in Vail.</TE>
<TE>   Since, she has either crashed or not finished in seven consecutive
world championship or Olympic races.</TE>
<TE>   After she crashed in Tuesday's downhill, catching an edge near the
bottom of the course in a flub many experts called an unforced error,
Lalive said she hoped her failures in big events were not some sort
of a pattern.</TE>
<TE>   But she seems to have developed a pattern.</TE>
<TE>   At last year's 2001 Alpine championship at St. Anton, Lalive
appeared poised to win a medal in the combined. She was in second
place and trailing Goetschl by only .79 before the final slalom run.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of playing it smart, though, Lalive skied too aggressively
and failed to finish.</TE>
<TE>   It was the same old snow story Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a ski mistake," U.S. women's coach Marjan Cernigoj said of
Lalive.</TE>
<TE>   "We know she's a great skier and she will overcome these
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Cernigoj said Lalive will retain her spot in Sunday's super-G, but
that Kildow, based on her performance in combined, will ski in slalom
next week at Deer Valley.</TE>

<HD>Fishermen Spring Into Action for Yellowtail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You know spring is in the air when....</LD>
<LD>   ... Yellowtail start breezing around the Coronado Islands. The
fish have yet to fully cooperate, but this is largely because Mother
Nature keeps blowing the fishermen back to port.</LD>
<LD>   "We licensed two boats to go out there last weekend but they got
blown back in," said John Yamate, manager of Seaforth Sportfishing in
San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   On Feb. 6, Doug Kern of Fisherman's Landing Tackle was at the
islands on a smaller boat and saw at least 50 spots of yellowtail
corralling bait fish at the surface--he caught two and lost
three--and said it was only a matter of time before a full-scale bite
erupts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing to see that kind of stuff going on in February,"
Kern said.</TE>
<TE>   ... White seabass begin making a splash at Santa Catalina Island.
Allyn Watson took Pierpoint Landing's Dreamer to the island Tuesday
and his customers put 12 large croakers (the largest a 20-pounder) on
the deck. In an interview with www.976-tuna.com, Watson pointed to a
jump in water temperature from 55 to 59 degrees as the reason.</TE>
<TE>   This undoubtedly will draw more attention to the backside of the
island, which until this week has been all but deserted.</TE>
<TE>   ... The really big tuna start cooperating for long-range fishermen
at Mexico's Revillagigedo Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The Excel returned to Fisherman's Landing on Wednesday with its
second 300-pounder of the season. Roca Partida was the hot spot.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Gray of the "Let's Talk Hook-up!" radio show was there aboard
the Royal Star and reported catching not only five yellowfin topping
100 pounds, but a black marlin estimated at 500 pounds before it was
unhooked.</TE>
<TE>   ... People start talking about the Eastern Sierra trout season
opener. It's not until April 28, but it's already a hot topic,
especially at Crowley Lake, where a faulty electrical wire reportedly
caused a fire two weeks ago that consumed a large storage facility,
in which were four pick-up trucks and an antique automobile, four
boats, several motors and other equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The tackle and boat rental shop was not damaged and Crowley Lake
Fish Camp should be ship-shape come opening day.</TE>
<TE>   ... Southland fly fishing groups start offering free casting
courses in anticipation of the trout opener. Sierra Pacific
Flyfishers is conducting its four Saturday clinics--from 9 a.m.-1
p.m.-- beginning March 16 at Reseda High in the San Fernando Valley.
The course culminates with a field trip to Piru Creek. Details: (818)
888-1974 or via e-mail at coachg1@earthlink.net.</TE>
<TE>   ... The Southern California Boat Show comes to town. The "Super
Bowl" of boat shows, boasting more than 600 of the latest models, is
scheduled March 2-10 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Admission
is $9 for adults and free for children 12 and under. Hours are 10
a.m.-10 p.m. Saturdays, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sundays, and 2-9 p.m. Monday
through Friday.</TE>
<TE>   ... Preparations start being made for the spring hunting season.
Hunter safety courses are being offered sporadically through March
and recorded information, with dates and locations, is available by
calling (562) 590-5670 or visiting www.dfg.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Also a rite of pre-spring: the San Gabriel Valley chapter of Quail
Unlimited's annual Gun Dog Showdown, which is an "attempt to
determine whether the pointing breeds or flushing breeds are better
suited for the rigors of upland game hunting."</TE>
<TE>   This year's event, featuring planted chukar, is March 9 beginning
at 7:30 a.m. at Prado Dog-Training Area in Chino. Registration is
$50. Details: (909) 624-7411 or via e-mail at sgvqu@onebox.com.</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Cabo San Lucas: Julio Castro of the Pisces Fleet will be honored
Saturday by the Billfish Foundation for releasing more billfish than
any other Cabo skipper during 2001. Castro, captain of the Tracy Ann,
also will be honored for releasing the most marlin worldwide. His
release total was listed at 178, but was actually 20%-25% higher,
Pisces owner Tracy Ehernberg said, because "not everyone wants to
fill in a release card when they come back from fishing."</TE>
<TE>   * Guadalupe Island: This remote island off central Baja California
has become known as much recently as a haunt for great white sharks
as it is for large tuna.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say that the sharks have ruined our fishing trips [by
stealing fish from hooks], but they have at times made it so it's
very difficult to get a fish in past them," said Art Taylor, owner
and operator of the Searcher. "They have that much of a presence."</TE>
<TE>   Given this, the veteran San Diego captain, in conjunction with the
Bay Area's Absolute Adventures, is plunging into the shark-diving
business, offering a series of five-day trips to Guadalupe that will
allow passengers to view great whites from within the safety of steel
cages. The trips, from June through November, cost $2,250-$2,400 per
person. Details: www.sharkdiver.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Zihuatanejo: If it's light-tackle sailfish action you're after,
it's hard to beat the Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo region. For the past few
weeks anglers have been logging phenomenal release totals and little
has changed.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best days was logged by a group from England, fishing
aboard four Ixtapa Sportfishing super pangas and leadering 38
sailfish in two days. Another pair from England logged eight sailfish
releases on a day they also boated a 72-pound dorado and waged
unsuccessful battle with three blue marlin.</TE>
<TE>   "The sailfish action has been nothing short of the very best
season we have had in many years," fleet manager Stan Lushinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   * New Mexico: Mark Mariani, a bowhunter from Greenwich, Conn.,
recently purchased the right to bag a Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep
this year in New Mexico. Cost of the tag, sold at auction during the
annual meeting in Reno of the Foundation for North American Wild
Sheep: $157,500. The money will be used for sheep restoration
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   A fishing tackle "Super Swap Meet" will be held Feb. 24 from 4
a.m.-noon in the parking lot of Ballyhooed Lures in Santa Ana, to
raise money for the Mel Auiler memorial fund. Auiler, who founded the
highly popular Allcoast Sportfishing Web site, died recently of
cancer. Tackle and trips will be on sale. Details: (949) 363-8558.</TE>

<KH>PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Jacobsen Scores 31; Stanford Romps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Casey Jacobsen had another brilliant game, scoring 31 points as No.
12 Stanford beat Washington, 91-65, Thursday night in Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobsen, the Pac-10's leading scorer, has topped the 40-point
mark twice this month, getting 49 against Arizona State--one point
off the school record--and 41 against Oregon two games later.</LD>
<LD>   He outscored Washington sophomore Doug Wrenn, the No. 2 scorer in
the conference, who had 24 points on 9-of-23 shooting. Jacobsen came
in averaging 22 points, Wrenn 20.4.</LD>
<TE>   Jacobsen was four for eight from three-point range and nine for 10
from the free throw line. He also had three rebounds and two assists.</TE>
<TE>   Wrenn, who had scored 30 or more points in four of his last five
games, finished with 11 rebounds for his third double-double of the
season. He was the only player in double figures for Washington
(8-16, 2-12)--a loser of five in a row and eight of nine.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies began the second half with an 8-3 spurt to pull within
45-41 with 16:05 left before Stanford (16-6, 9-4) responded with an
11-2 run.</TE>
<TE>   Washington trailed by double digits the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Borchardt, a 7-foot, 240-pound center from nearby Redmond,
Wash., had 15 points and 16 rebounds for the Cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford is in a five-way tie for second place in the Pac-10 with
California, Oregon, UCLA and USC.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is in ninth place in the Pac-10 and must move up a spot
and pass Oregon State to qualify for the conference tournament. Coach
Bob Bender's job security is uncertain as the Huskies could lose 20
games for a third consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Borchardt and Jacobsen scored Stanford's first 15 points as the
the Huskies failed to get a rebound until Wrenn pulled one down at
13:17.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal outrebounded the Huskies 19-2 midway through the
first half and finished with a 48-31 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   California 77, Washington State 56--The Bears had their most
decisive road victory since a 73-43 win over USC on Feb. 12, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Cal (18-5, 9-4) outrebounded Washington State, 44-37, and had six
blocked shots, including four by Jamal Sampson.</TE>
<TE>   With Washington State's top post player, J Locklier, sidelined by
injury, California took advantage of its superior and taller front
court.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears played four players who were 6-foot-10 or taller. The
Cougars' 6-foot-11 Pawel Stasiak, making his first start of the
season, was Washington State's tallest player. The Cougars had no
other player taller than 6-7.</TE>
<TE>   Stasiak scored only three points, while the Bears quartet of post
players outscored the Cougars post players 36-10.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bush led Washington State (5-17, 1-13) with 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson and Ryan Forehan-Kelly scored 11 points each to lead Cal.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears never trailed. Washington State got as close as 27-26
with 4:32 remaining in the first half, but Cal responded with a 13-4
run to end the half ahead  40-32.</TE>
<TE>   Cal opened the second half with a 22-10 run.</TE>

<HD>No Denying That Gadzuric Was the Center of Attention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was Dan Gadzuric's game.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA ran a motion offense, four perimeter players and Gadzuric
down low with room to roam because Arizona defenders had to fight
through all the movement to get to Gadzuric. The offense was designed
for Gadzuric.</LD>
<LD>   Freedom is a wonderful thing and with Gadzuric on the move,
running to the ball, slamming on the fly, rebounding and frolicking
in the lane as if he was a kid who'd just been told school was
canceled because of snow, he took advantage. Gadzuric had 22 points
and 16 rebounds and was the big difference in UCLA's 77-76 victory
against Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   Steve Lavin seems to have realized that the Bruins don't win if
Gadzuric isn't brilliant and isn't taking advantage of his skills.
Lavin could be congratulated for discovering this or he could be
questioned about why it took him so long to discover this. Gadzuric
is, after all, a senior. All his talents and all his weaknesses
should be obvious by now.</TE>
<TE>   In this game, it was all his talents that were available for the
Bruins to use. The single most impressive moment came after Gadzuric
had the ball stolen from him by Jason Gardner. Gardner is 5-foot-10
and a guard. Gadzuric is 6-11 and a center. And still, when Gardner
was going up for what he thought was an uncontested layup, Gadzuric
had caught up and pinned the ball on the backboard. Goaltending was
called and no UCLA fan at Pauley agreed with that. Gadzuric did hit
the rim, but his speed and his leap made it seem obvious that
Gadzuric should be having a much better season than he has.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, even with Gadzuric amazing us all, it was time to take a deep
breath and hang on for another scrambling, loopy, chaotic and wild
ride to the end.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Bruins' best hope now that they cling to the opponent,
not get blown out early and then fling themselves willy-nilly at the
ball and at the basket. They flourish when they need the desperate
three-point basket by Jason Kapono with 18.9 seconds to go. They need
the frantic, arm-waving, crazy quilt defense at the end to stop
Arizona from getting one more chance to score.</TE>
<TE>   It is UCLA's best hope that brilliant, exhausting, singular
efforts such as Gadzuric's keep the game from getting out of hand.
And then the Bruins are at their best, when the game plans don't
matter and everybody on both teams is running around with no plan
except to throw the ball into the basket.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened for the second consecutive game at Pauley
Pavilion, with a mad dash to the finish line. Against USC last week,
Billy Knight made a nerveless game-winning shot from 22 feet away.
This week, UCLA defenders were waving their arms frantically as
Channing Frye's baseline jump shot lipped out and as Arizona Coach
Lute Olson was</TE>
<TE>   screaming and gesturing that a foul be</TE>
<TE>   called.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona had come to UCLA as the leader of the Pacific 10
Conference. This is interesting because the Wildcats, having lost
three starters from last year's Final Four team, were supposed to
struggle this season and not be in the class with the veteran Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   It was mesmerizing to watch Luke Walton and Jason Gardner,
Arizona's two juniors, and the way they have gained an understanding
of the game. Walton knows his young teammates and how to get them the
ball in places where they can score. Gardner knew exactly how to beat
his UCLA defender to a spot just outside the three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   What the Bruins are learning to rely on is their hard headedness.
They will not quit. If there is no lead they can call safe, there is
also no deficit they feel is unconquerable. UCLA was behind nearly
all game, by as much as 10, usually by seven or eight. The proof of
this desire is that UCLA outrebounded the Wildcats, 45-28.</TE>
<TE>   It is interesting watching the Bruin players figure out how to win
at the end of games. You must believe they are doing it on their own,
winning or losing, if you listen to their coach.</TE>
<TE>   Again Thursday night, Lavin said what a bad coaching job he has
been doing. He said that after the USC game and the Villanova game.
Lavin said he did a "terrible job" in the final seconds of the UCLA
loss Saturday at Villanova. He said he was doing "a bad job" of
coaching his players on not dribbling too much, a habit that leads to
turnovers. Almost every game now Lavin tells us "what a bad job I've
done."</TE>
<TE>   If Lavin really means this, if he really believes he is such a bad
coach, then he might want to think about resigning. If he is saying
this only for effect, only to get the critics off his back, then it
makes him look silly. And how is it instilling confidence in his
players if the coach is always telling the world he is a bad coach?</TE>
<TE>   How about zipping it up, Steve? How about working on keeping
Gadzuric going and getting Kapono into his shooting spots, kind of
like Olson gets Gardner to his. How about telling your team about
dribbling too much instead of blaming yourself for not telling them?
Then watch, with the rest of us, to see how it turns out.</TE>

<LD>One afternoon last year, a teenage girl showed up at the Garfield
High gym in East Los Angeles with her parents, escorted by the dean
of students.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like you to meet Brisa Silva," the dean told Bulldog girls'
basketball Coach Ed Kikuchi, who was busy conducting practice for 45
players. "She'd like a tryout."</LD>
<LD>   Silva returned to the gym the next day. Kikuchi handed her a
basketball and told her to dribble. Up and down the court she went,
dribbling right-handed, then left-handed.</LD>
<TE>   End of tryout.</TE>
<TE>   "You're on the team," Kikuchi told her. "I knew right away she was
a talent."</TE>
<TE>   Silva, who arrived from Mexico speaking no English and wanting to
become a professional basketball player, is turning into an
extraordinary player.</TE>
<TE>   She's averaging 24 points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.8 steals for
Garfield (21-3), which went 10-0 in the Eastern League and opens the
City Section playoffs tonight as the No. 5-seeded team, playing host
to Woodland Hills Taft.</TE>
<TE>   Kikuchi, who officiated for 25 years and has coached for 10 years,
said, "I've seen a lot of players. Out of the East L.A. area, she
could be the best."</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-7 Silva has made more than 60 three-pointers, and
possesses quickness and athleticism. She has even intimidated players
on the Garfield boys' team.</TE>
<TE>   "They're scared of her," teammate Cinthya Felix said. "They don't
want to play one-on-one because they might lose."</TE>
<TE>   Silva said she has been playing basketball since she was 5. She
lived in Rosario, a small city an hour from Mazatlan in the state of
Sinaloa. She'd play every day at a park near her home on baskets that
had no nets. She participated in the Junior Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Her uncle bought her fancy shoes, Air Jordans and Pippens. Her
favorite player is Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   She's a 17-year-old sophomore who has only one year of high school
eligibility left because she'll be too old to play as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   She said through an interpreter that one reason she wanted to come
to Los Angeles was for the basketball opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition is better here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, she began as a reserve after arriving in January and
ended up starting on a team that reached the City Invitational
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some players jealous at the beginning because she was
so good, but they respected her afterward," assistant Kleber Camacho
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kikuchi is grateful that Silva just happened to move two blocks
from Garfield.</TE>
<TE>   "If [other schools] knew ahead of time she was a superstar, she
could have played at any school she wanted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Silva is trying to improve her English. She watches cartoons and
is taking English as a second language.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, who arrived from Mexico more than two years ago and now
speaks fluent English, said Silva doesn't use her English much for
fear people might laugh if she says the wrong words. "She's going to
be able to do it," Felix said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Silva is having no trouble becoming an American
teenager. She loves Big Macs, Whoppers, Chinese food and hanging out
at the mall. Basketball, though, is her passion.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to demonstrate her shooting skills, she stood up from
the bleachers, dribbled to the three-point line and calmly made the
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson couldn't have done it better.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brigham Young-bound quarterback Ben Olson of Thousand Oaks is
serious about competing for the starting position as a freshman in
the fall. He plans to leave for Provo, Utah, in June, a week after
his graduation, and spend the summer learning the Cougars' offense.
It means he's unlikely to leave on a Mormon mission.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA-bound Matt Moore of Newhall Hart has been selected to play
quarterback for the South team in the Shrine All-Star Classic on July
13 at Mount San Antonio College.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Speedo jokes are going to come fast and furious for sophomore
Leandro Dottavio of Van Nuys Grant. He's the Lancers' starting
catcher and the defending City swim champion in the
freshman-sophomore 50-yard butterfly. He'll compete in both sports
this spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Interscholastic Surfing Federation championships are set for
Feb. 23-24 at Oceanside Harbor. Watch out for Brett Simpson of
Huntington Beach, Travis Mellem of San Clemente and the Gudauskas
twins, Patrick and Dane, of San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village Oaks Christian is 22-1 in its first season of
varsity basketball, and the Lions have a future college player in 6-2
sophomore guard Mike Hornbuckle, who can shoot, dribble and play
defense.</TE>

<LD>The voice on the phone was familiar.</LD>
<LD>   "The voice sounds pretty good, doesn't it?" Chick Hearn asked
Thursday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, Hearn was told, the voice sounds good.</LD>
<TE>   Now it was Hearn's turn to answer a question: When's he coming
back?</TE>
<TE>   Hearn said he will see his cardiologist Monday. "If he gives me
the go sign, I'll be back March 1," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn felt pretty good about getting the go sign and later
Thursday the Lakers put out a news release confirming that Hearn, who
had heart surgery Dec. 19, plans to return for the March 1 home game
against the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a happy day for the Lakers and our fans," General Manager
Mitch Kupchak said.</TE>
<TE>   Swan Song for CBS</TE>
<TE>   CBS says goodbye to the Nissan Open this weekend. The tournament
moves to ABC next year.</TE>
<TE>   CBS coordinating producer Lance Barrow said it will be a low-key
goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "The tournament isn't going away, just we are," Barrow said.</TE>
<TE>   Fans' Favorite</TE>
<TE>   Golf Digest recently conducted a survey about golf television
coverage. The magazine received more than 3,000 Internet responses
and phoned 400 readers at random.</TE>
<TE>   CBS was cited as the fans' favorite, edging the Golf Channel.
ESPN, ABC and NBC tied for third.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' Jim Nantz was picked as the best host, and NBC's Johnny
Miller and CBS' David Feherty and Gary McCord were named the top
three commentators.</TE>
<TE>   Some Comeback</TE>
<TE>   Before Thursday's round, Feherty had this to say about the
resurgence of John Daly, who shot a 70: "When you talk about the
great comebacks in sports, you've got to mention Ben Hogan's comeback
after his car wreck in 1949. But it was only Hogan's body that was
broken.</TE>
<TE>   "If John manages to come back and win, it's one of the great
stories in sports. His brain was completely disconnected and pickled.
I mean really."</TE>
<TE>   Recommended Viewing</TE>
<TE>   You never know what Feherty and McCord might come up with when
they do one of their late-night West Coast Swing highlight shows.</TE>
<TE>   The plan for Thursday night's show was to stage their own "Caddie
Olympics," with events such as the gallery jump rope and golf bag
relays.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Caddie Olympics, you'll know the judging is crooked,"
cracked Feherty.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's show at 12:50 will feature outtakes from the last four
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   On a more serious note, ESPN offers "Finding the Fairway" Sunday
at 11 a.m. as a part of Black History Month. This half-hour show,
produced by PGA Tour Productions, looks at the plight of African
Americans in golf.</TE>
<TE>   Among those featured will be Joe Louis Barrow Jr., the son of the
former boxing champion. Barrow is the national director of the First
Tee youth golf initiative.</TE>
<TE>   A Gift for Bel-Air</TE>
<TE>   Ken Venturi, the captain of the winning U.S. President's Cup team
two years ago, presented the trophy to Bel-Air Country Club Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   That's the second trophy Venturi has given to Bel-Air. The club
already had Venturi's trophy from his 1964 U.S. Open victory.</TE>
<TE>   Pardon the Interruption</TE>
<TE>   America's Olympic network, NBC, which supplemented its Winter
Olympic coverage last Sunday with the NBA All-Star game, will
interrupt Olympic coverage this Sunday for the Daytona 500. No, NBC
will not delay the race on the West Coast to get a bigger audience.
It will be shown live at 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   And at 1:30 p.m., NBC will televise the Lakers' game at Portland,
with Marv Albert, Steve Jones and Bill Walton announcing.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Channel 7's Bill Weir, who has a way of growing on people, says he
plans to leave the station to explore possibilities outside sports
when his contract expires in September. One possibility is a
late-night talk show on USA, which would be produced by Lorne
Michaels, a co-creator of NBC's "Saturday Night Live." ... That show
is not to be confused with the show NBC is now showing on the West
Coast, "Every Night Delayed."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' game against Michael Jordan and the Washington Wizards
Tuesday night on Fox Sports Net had a 7.3 rating, making it the cable
network's highest-rated Laker game of the season. The game also
generated a record 2.6 rating for that night's "Southern California
Sports Report." ... Nationally, the Lakers and Wizards on TNT got a
2.2 cable rating. That's impressive, but the Westminster Kennel Club
Dog Show on USA that night got a 3.2.... Attention Lisa Guerrero
fans: Beginning Monday, she'll have her own Web site on
FoxSports.com. The keyword is LisaG. UCLA's game against Arizona
State on Saturday at 12:30 p.m. will be televised on ABC, with Terry
Gannon and Len Elmore announcing. The versatile Gannon, former North
Carolina State basketball star, is also ABC's lead figure skating
announcer.... ESPN's three hours of "The Block" Sunday features the
second part of "The Season: Behind Bars" at 5 p.m., "SportsCentury:
1981" at 6:30 p.m., and "Sidelines: L.A. Hoops," featuring the
Clippers, at 7 p.m. Highlights of the look back at 1981 include
Fernandomania and the Oakland Raiders becoming the first wild-card
team to win the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   Within the next week or so, Jim Rome, as he has been saying on his
radio show, will decide whether to devote all his energy to radio or
television. The guess here is Rome will pick radio, a medium he has
dominated the past decade.... Furman Bisher, veteran sports columnist
for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was a guest on Rome's radio
show Thursday and had a unique way of describing the passing of an
old-time boxing character named "Chicken Man" Jones. "He died of an
overdose of bullets," Bisher said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Kelly was a guest of Scott Kaplan and Billy Ray Smith on XTRA
(690) this week and unloaded on ABC's Al Michaels and Dan Fouts for
not explaining that he had to leave last weekend's Pro Bowl
festivities because his son Hunter was hospitalized. But Fouts talked
with Kelly on Thursday and smoothed things over.</TE>
<TE>   While Fred Roggin is busy in Salt Lake City, Petros Papadakis has
been filling in on his KMPC (1540) show, offering a unique
perspective. Roggin still has a presence on the show, filing reports
from Utah.... KMPC's Chris Myers and Bob Golic will be broadcasting
from Riviera today.... While KNX (1070) is offering periodic Olympic
reports from the Westwood One network daily at 16 and 46 minutes
after the hour most hours until midnight, KMPC is offering Westwood
One's long form coverage every evening. Saturday and Sunday's
expanded coverage will run from 5-9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Where has Joe McDonnell been? The KSPN (1110) talk show host
seemed shocked that NBC was delaying its Winter Olympic coverage in
the West, even though it had been well publicized. McDonnell blamed
NBC's Dick Ebersol and of course called him an idiot, which is
McDonnell's favorite word. Dave Stone had to step in and point out
that Ebersol wanted the coverage to be shown at 5 p.m. in the West
but lost that battle. So who was the idiot there?</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   So who's watching the Olympics? The two leading demographic groups
are women 25-54 and women 18-49.</TE>

<HD>Bruins' Win a Nail-Biter</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Kapono's three-point shot gives UCLA
lead, then it survives scramble to beat Arizona, 77-76</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Gadzuric, the center from the Netherlands so often lost in Never
Never Land, kept UCLA from slipping into the Pacific 10 Conference
abyss with a dominant performance worthy of his 6-foot-11 frame and
astonishing athleticism.</LD>
<LD>   Gadzuric's power inside kept the Bruins close enough for Jason
Kapono's three-point basket with 19 seconds to decide the outcome, a
77-76 victory against No. 9 Arizona on Thursday night in front of
11,960 at Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of sliding alone into sixth place, No. 20 UCLA (17-7, 9-4
in the conference) is one of six teams with four losses, five of
which trail Arizona (17-7, 10-4) by a half-game.</LD>
<TE>   So UCLA remains in the running for the conference title and a
favorable seeding in the NCAA tournament--by rebounding from a
dispiriting road loss to Villanova to knock off a team that overcame
a 20-point second-half deficit to beat the Bruins a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The last two weeks have been really challenging for our program,"
Coach Steve Lavin said. "I'm proud how our team bounced back."</TE>
<TE>   It was reminiscent of last season's meeting here between these
teams, a 79-77 UCLA victory in overtime. Gadzuric had 22 points and
17 rebounds in that one, and he had 22 points and 16 rebounds in this
one.</TE>
<TE>   "I got off out there the same way," he said. "I thought about it
and had the same opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   He stayed out of foul trouble, yet did not compromise his
aggressiveness. Too often, striking that delicate balance has been
difficult for a player foreign to finesse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm learning the game," he said. "I just have to keep my poise."</TE>
<TE>   That trait he can pick up from Kapono, who gave UCLA its first
lead since 13-12 with a three-point basket with 1:06 to play. After
Arizona's Jason Gardner made a 24-foot three-pointer with 36.4
seconds left, Kapono drilled another for the winning points.</TE>
<TE>   "I just did what I do best," said Kapono, who had 20 points and
made six of 11 from long range.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona had a chance to win, but freshman center Channing Frye
missed an open jumper from five feet, got the rebound and missed
again. Wildcat forward Rick Anderson ended up with the loose ball,
but Gadzuric forced a jump ball as the buzzer sounded.</TE>
<TE>   Frye did not miss a shot and scored 19 points in Arizona's victory
over UCLA at Tucson, outplaying Gadzuric. This time the tables
turned--Frye scored only five points.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona found it difficult to double-team Gadzuric because UCLA
went to a motion offense early in the game for the first time all
year, spreading four players on the perimeter and giving the center
room inside.</TE>
<TE>   He was inspired from the outset, scoring 13 points and grabbing
nine rebounds in the first half. He had three dunks and four of his
six baskets came after he grabbed offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Barnes also had nine rebounds, but committed four of UCLA's
nine turnovers. Barnes finished with 15 rebounds, helping the Bruins
to a 45-28 advantage on the boards, one of their most decisive
margins of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We hit the boards hard," Barnes said. "We haven't done that much
of the year and we knew it would be a big key."</TE>
<TE>   Reserve point guard Ryan Walcott made a difference too. Starter
Cedric Bozeman struggled, missing his four shots and committing three
turnovers in 21 minutes, so Walcott played most of the second half,
contributing six points and three assists.</TE>
<TE>   He also slowed Gardner, who scored 25 but did not get open on
Arizona's last possession.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona stepped on the accelerator whenever possible and scored in
transition. The fast pace also enabled the Wildcats to get open looks
from three-point range, and they made 11 of 22. Gardner hit seven of
10.</TE>
<TE>   After a three-point basket by Kapono tied the score, 28-28, with
five minutes left in the first half, Arizona rattled off 12 of the
next 14 points for a 10-point lead. A dunk by Dijon Thompson off an
inside pass from Gadzuric and a post move by Barnes pulled the Bruins
within 40-34 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, Gadzuric's muscle kept UCLA within reach until
Kapono's touch tilted the scale.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono was reluctant to shoot early, passing up an open look on
UCLA's second possession and throwing the ball away, causing
assistant coach Jim Saia to pantomime a shooting motion to him.
Seconds later, the junior forward dribbled to get an open three-point
basket for the first Bruin points.</TE>
<TE>   In the final seconds, Kapono needed no such prompting.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given what USC has endured this season, you couldn't have blamed the
Trojans had they shipped in Anthony Robbins this week for some pep
talks or spent the last eight days watching Saturday Night Live tapes
of Stuart Smalley.</LD>
<LD>   You're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people
like you.</LD>
<LD>   Mired in a two-game losing funk and having dropped three games
this season on buzzer-beating three-point shots, the 25th-ranked
Trojans seemed to be in dire need of motivational speakers.</LD>
<TE>   Then again, winning seems to cure all.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night at the Sports Arena, 4,802 witnessed the Trojans'
epiphany as they dumped the negativity of the past few weeks to beat
Arizona State, 83-61, completing a regular-season sweep of the Sun
Devils.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans improved to 17-6 overall, 9-4 in the Pacific 10
Conference, jumping into a five-way tie for second place with Oregon,
California, UCLA and Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State dropped to 13-10, 6-8.</TE>
<TE>   Two of USC's most likely candidates for a self-help
seminar--senior David Bluthenthal and freshman Errick Craven--had
much-needed awakenings.</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal, who recently said his senior year has been the most
trying of his career, had an inkling that he wouldn't start against
the Sun Devils. He also said he'd be OK with that.</TE>
<TE>   He was correct on both counts.</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal, who was shooting 24% from the field over his previous
four games, came off the bench to finish with a game-high 21 points
on seven-of-12 shooting from the field, three of five from beyond the
three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   He also had 10 rebounds for his third double-double of the season
and blocked a shot in 27 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Craven, who hit the freshman wall and used the eight-day break
between games to ice his heavy legs and soothe his tired spirit, had
14 points on five-of-nine shooting, three of five on three-pointers,
and also had two steals in 26 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Senior power forward Sam Clancy had his ninth straight
double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   USC blocked a season-high 10 shots and shot 84%, 21 of 25 from the
free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans held Arizona State's leading scorer, center Chad
Prewitt, who entered the game averaging 18 points, to five points.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since Dec. 12, 16 games ago, USC trotted out a
different starting lineup. Senior guard Gennaro Busterna, fresh off
his career-high 12-point outing at UCLA last week, had his first
career start as a Trojan and sophomore small forward Jerry Dupree
started for the first time since USC's third game.</TE>
<TE>   Busterna was held scoreless in 10 minutes and Dupree had seven
points in 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State jumped out to a 6-4 lead four minutes into the game
with USC sluggish with its unfamiliar lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with the Trojans leading by one, 8-7, at the 13:30 mark,
Bluthenthal and Craven entered the game and USC never looked back.</TE>
<TE>   With its familiar components on the floor, USC began pressing and
the Trojans embarked on a 24-8 run over the next 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the spree was over, on an emphatic Craven dunk, USC
led by a first-half high 17 points, 32-15, with 3:40 remaining until
intermission.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils, though, closed out with a 6-2 run and, with USC
sending out the same five starters to begin the second half, Arizona
State scored the first six points of the half to climb within seven
points, 34-27, with 17:25 to play.</TE>
<TE>   USC, after inserting Bluthenthal and Craven, took off again.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans went on a 24-7 run over the next seven minutes to go
up by a game-high 24 points, 58-34, on a pair of Bluthenthal free
throws with 10:18 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the run, three Bluthenthal three-pointers in a
143-second span and a blocked shot by the small forward after making
a 23-footer from the top of the key.</TE>

<LD>Jimmy Miggins and Devin Montgomery scored 20 points each as
Pepperdine beat Portland, 83-77, on Thursday night at Portland,
keeping the Waves undefeated in West Coast Conference play.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine (18-6, 11-0 in conference) has a 13-game winning streak
that is the nation's longest. The Waves play eighth-ranked Gonzaga
(23-3, 10-1) Saturday in Spokane, Wash. Pepperdine dealt the Bulldogs
their last loss, on Jan. 18 at Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   Despite enjoying a decided height advantage, the Waves trailed
most of the first half and the early stages of the second. But
Pepperdine then turned a 45-42 Portland lead into a 54-45 advantage
with 13:38 left.</LD>
<TE>   A three-point basket by Montgomery at the 10-minute mark gave
Pepperdine its biggest lead at 64-51. Portland bounced back, though,
with a four-point play by Casey Frandsen and a dunk by Ghislain Sema
to make it 67-63 with 6:53 to play. But Pepperdine made eight of 10
free throws down the stretch to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Frandsen led Portland (5-20, 1-10) with 28 points, including seven
three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Portland Coach Michael Holton decided to shake things up by
starting the game with his two leading scorers, Frandsen and center
Coky Rochin, on the bench. Frandsen didn't score his first basket
until the 12 minute mark of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Gonzaga 72, Loyola Marymount 51--Dan Dickau scored 23 points
and Cory Violette had 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Bulldogs at
Spokane, Wash. Violette scored 11 points in the second half as
Gonzaga pulled away to win its eighth consecutive game overall and
25th in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount (9-16, 2-9) has lost eight consecutive games
overall and 14 in a row to Gonzaga. The Lions shot 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Dennis, who led Loyola Marymount with 12 points, made a
three-point basket to cut Gonzaga's lead to 47-42 midway in the
second half, but Dickau made a three-point basket to start an 11-0
run and the Lions never threatened again.</TE>

<TE>   Biggest Question Of Spring</TE>
<TE>   Will pitchers Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby return to peak form after
undergoing elbow surgery last year? If the two right-handers are
sound, the Dodgers will have rotation depth from which they can trade
for a proven closer, center fielder or leadoff hitter. If not,
General Manager Dan Evans will lose that depth, diminishing his
chances of a deal that would improve the club.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Job Seekers</TE>
<TE>   Eric Gagne, Daal and Perez will battle for the fifth rotation
spot. Four players--Tom Goodwin, Marquis Grissom, McKay Christensen
and Dave Roberts--will compete for the center-field job, though
Roberts is viewed more as a reserve. Cesar Izturis will push Alex
Cora for the shortstop job. Bichette, Mike Kinkade and Mark Whiten
will compete for a reserve outfield spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keep Your Eye On</TE>
<TE>   Izturis. The slick-fielding, speedy 22-year-old is expected to
beat out Cora, but it will be asking a lot of Izturis to handle the
rigors of baseball's most demanding defensive position next to
catching. "I can't remember too many championship-caliber clubs that
weren't pretty darn strong up the middle," Manager Jim Tracy said.
"We don't want to put undue pressure on him. First and foremost,
catch the ball at that position. If you can't, we can't win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reasons to Be Excited</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green, who batted .297 with 49 home runs and 125 runs batted
in last season, is developing into one of baseball's premier hitters,
and Paul Lo Duca emerged in 2001 as a superb all-around catcher. Eric
Karros and Adrian Beltre appear sound after injury-plagued 2001
seasons. Despite the loss of Chan Ho Park, the rotation should be
strong as long as Brown and Ashby are sound.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reasons to Be Worried</TE>
<TE>   Brown and Ashby underwent serious elbow procedures, and there is
no guarantee they'll be ready for the season or return to pre-surgery
form. There is no legitimate offensive threat in the leadoff spot,
and that could leave Green with few RBI opportunities. There is no
ninth-inning hammer, that powerful, reliable and proven closer, to
hold late-game leads.</TE>

<HD>State Debt May Be Refinanced</HD>
<DH>Budget: Davis backs move to save $1 billion, abandons his
plan to delay payments to pension funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is ditching his plan to whittle away at the state's
$12.5-billion budget shortfall by delaying pension payments to state
employees and teachers.</LD>
<LD>   The Davis administration has decided instead to embrace a strategy
by Treasurer Phil Angelides to free up $1 billion by taking advantage
of low interest rates to refinance the state's debt.</LD>
<LD>   The move allows Davis to pare the budget deficit, but without
requiring the approval of Republican lawmakers.</LD>
<TE>   GOP legislators vehemently opposed the governor's plan to skip
$1.9 billion in pension payments over three years to the California
Public Employees' Retirement System and California State Teachers
Retirement System. By one estimate, the plan could have cost
taxpayers $10 billion over 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' finance officials had signaled they would shelve the
proposal if they could come up with a cheaper plan, which, they said,
they found in Angelides' idea.</TE>
<TE>   "The criticism that some of the borrowing was expensive wasn't
unfair," said Tim Gage, director of the state Department of Finance.</TE>
<TE>   Under Angelides' proposal, the state's bond payments would be
minimized by deferring principal payments for four years and by
switching from fixed-rate to variable-rate bonds, which have proved
cheaper in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Gage estimated the plan would free up $1.1 billion during this
fiscal year and the next when California is expected to face at least
a $12.5-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Davis and lawmakers have reduced state expenses by $2.2
billion through current-year spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Gage said the refinancing plan, which will require approval from a
variety of state finance committees established to authorize bonds,
would provide about $200 million more than the pension proposal would
have over two fiscal years.</TE>
<TE>   GOP lawmakers welcomed word of Davis' decision to drop the pension
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is they're not going to borrow money for 30 years
at 81/2% interest," Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga
said. "The bad news is it sounds like they're going to refinance the
state bond package and then declare a holiday from making payments."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a step in the right direction," added Assemblyman
John Campbell, the Irvine Republican who handles budget matters for
his caucus.</TE>
<TE>   "The other plan had many bad attributes. I think now the big
question is how much is prudent to borrow?"</TE>

<HD>William L. Dwyer, 72; Judge Ruled on Logging, Baseball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. District Judge William L. Dwyer, a Seattle legal giant whose
landmark rulings include halting logging in national forests in the
Pacific Northwest and ordering the U.S. Forest Service to adopt a
plan for the survival of the spotted owl, has died. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Dwyer, who as a trial lawyer representing the state of Washington
and King County in the 1970s kept major league baseball in Seattle,
died Tuesday of complications of lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a few years ago, he cut back
his work schedule and went on "senior status" in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   But even after being diagnosed with cancer last spring, he
continued working until the end of January, the same month Thomas
Dunne Books published "In the Hands of the People," Dwyer's appraisal
of the jury system.</TE>
<TE>   "Among federal judges in the Northwest in modern times, he's
without peer," said Stewart Jay, professor of law at the University
of Washington. "Frankly, I think he's one of the great federal
judges, period. He stands very well among some of the great trial
judges of our history."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a towering figure before he was ever put on the bench,"
District Judge Robert Lasnik said.</TE>
<TE>   A liberal Democrat, Dwyer was appointed to the U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Washington in 1987 after 30 years of
practicing law in Seattle, where he earned the nickname "Destructo"
for his low-key yet relentless way with opponents on the witness
stand.</TE>
<TE>   Among Dwyer's better-known cases as a district judge were the
nation's first federal product-tampering homicide case in 1988. He
also overturned the death sentence of one of Washington's most
notorious killers in 1991, and in 1994 declared that the state's
term-limits law was unconstitutional as it applied to members of
Congress because it limited voters' freedom of choice.</TE>
<TE>   But Dwyer was best known for ordering the U.S. Forest Service to
adopt a conservation plan for the spotted owl and other species in
forest habitat areas.</TE>
<TE>   His 1991 injunction against logging in national forests in
Washington, Oregon and Northern California remained in place for
three years. In 1994, the Clinton administration drafted the
Northwest Forest Plan, which allowed some logging as long as there
were sufficient protections for species that depended on old trees.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer's ruling earned him the praise of environmentalists and the
ire of the logging industry. The decision was even denounced on the
Senate floor by Washington Sen. Slade Gorton, who blasted Dwyer's
ruling as being "irresponsible" and "anti-human."</TE>
<TE>   But Gorton, who reportedly later admitted that any judge would
have issued the same ruling, always had the highest respect for
Dwyer: It had been Gorton, along with then-Sen. Dan Evans--a fellow
Republican from Washington--who had recommended Dwyer for the vacant
U.S. District Court seat during the Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   "You're in it to do justice and to uphold the Constitution, and to
be fair to everybody," Dwyer said of his most famous ruling in a 1999
interview with the Seattle Times. "You're not in it to try to please
those who brought about your appointment, or to try to displease
those who were opposed to it. None of that has anything to do with
it."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Olympia in 1929, Dwyer grew up in Seattle. As a student at
the University of Washington in 1948, he wandered into a freshman law
torts class and listened to a colorfully engaging professor discuss
the basics of legal reasoning. Dwyer was hooked.</TE>
<TE>   He earned a bachelor of science degree in law from the University
of Washington and his law degree from New York University in 1953.
After serving three years in the Army in Germany, he returned to
Seattle, where he opened a law practice.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer first came to national attention as a lead trial attorney in
1963 when he represented John Goldmark, an Okanogan County rancher
and state Democratic lawmaker who had been falsely accused of being a
communist by the John Birch wing of the GOP during the 1962 election</TE>
<TE>   After losing his legislative seat, Goldmark sued his political
opponents for libel.</TE>
<TE>   The urbane Dwyer was said to have won over the conservative, rural
Okanogan County jury members, many in jeans and dirt-splattered
shoes, with his arguments that a decent man had been libeled.</TE>
<TE>   In a tragic twist 22 years later, Goldmark's son, Charles, a
prominent Seattle attorney, and his wife and two young sons were
beaten and stabbed to death by a jobless steelworker. David Rice, who
told a friend the night of the murders that he was going to kill "the
top communist," was sentenced to death in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, Dwyer was hired to represent the state and King County in
a lawsuit against the American League and baseball owners. Government
officials accused the American League of a breach of contract when it
allowed the Seattle Pilots to move to Milwaukee, where they became
the Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   A 1976 settlement, after four weeks of a jury trial, led to the
creation of the Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   A bibliophile who read several books at a time, Dwyer conversed
easily about history, politics, music and art, and could regale
public audiences and dinner-table companions with quotations form
Shakespeare and legal philosophers.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a remarkable sense of humor, a quiet wit that he never
lost," said District Judge Barbara Rothstein. "I think everyone here
feels a light has gone out in our lives in the courthouse because he
was just a wonderful person to have around."</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer is survived by his wife, Vasiliki; his children, Joanna
Dwyer Tiffany of Indianola, Wash., Tony Dwyer of Seattle, and Charles
Dwyer of Indianola; and five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Report Downplays Border Fence Impact</HD>
<DH>Environment: Activists and the state are unconvinced by the
INS study of the proposed 5-mile barrier and road crossing a state
park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposed second border fence and patrol road along five miles of
the U.S.-Mexico boundary in San Diego County would cause minimal
environmental damage, though it would slice through a state park next
to the Pacific Ocean, says a new analysis of the project's impacts by
U.S. immigration officials.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is for the most controversial segment of a
14-mile-long backup fence and accompanying 150-foot-wide patrol road
between the two fences along the western end of the international
boundary. The five miles that remain unfinished have stirred concern
among environmentalists over the fate of endangered birds and plants.
The plan also has drawn fire from state officials who fear
irreparable harm to Border Field State Park, which would be bisected
by the patrol road and the new fence.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been consistently opposed and we remain consistently
opposed," said Roy Stearns, spokesman for the Department of Parks and
Recreation. "As one of our people said, it will look more like a
Guantanamo Bay prison fence than a park fence."</LD>
<TE>   The draft environmental impact statement, issued by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service this month, is the first
formal description of U.S. construction plans, which have been
roughly outlined previously. It deals with two stretches--31/2 miles
next to the ocean and a 11/2-mile section near Otay Mountain, about
10 miles to the east.</TE>
<TE>   The report said that adding a second layer of fence parallel to
the existing border barrier will help U.S. Border Patrol agents
prevent unlawful entries without harming endangered bird species,
such as the least Bell's vireo and California gnatcatcher, or two
types of fairy shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   "Four endangered species may be affected, but not adversely
affected" by the construction, the draft report said. The INS
analysis said species may benefit from the proposed fence and patrol
road because fewer illegal entries would mean fewer people trampling
sensitive habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The all-weather patrol road and the second fence, which have been
partially built along the 14-mile stretch, would allow agents to
drive directly parallel to the border, rather than having to weave
through hills and canyons nearby. A third fence was included in the
draft, though officials said it may never be built.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 immigration reform law ordered that the extra border
fencing and patrol road be built along the 14 miles ending at the
Pacific. The area was once a hot spot for illegal crossings but has
quieted dramatically since the advent in 1994 of Operation
Gatekeeper, which doubled the number of agents and added fencing,
border lights and underground sensors to deter undocumented migrants.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have expressed dismay at the massive excavation
that would be required to build a level road across deep canyons.
They have argued that such digging would disturb native plants and
endangered birds.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the most controversial element involves the plan to
extend the additional fence through the 803-acre state park, which
occupies the southwestern corner of the continental United States and
sits amid a 2,500-acre, federally protected estuary.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol officials had earlier indicated that they might run
the planned fence across the park, but the environmental report
officially described it as the proposed course.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Imperial Beach has expressed concern that such a move
could impede plans to boost ecologically oriented tourism there.</TE>
<TE>   "In an era of binational cooperation on the environment, it really
is a travesty that it can't be worked out," said Mayda Winter, the
city's mayor pro tem.</TE>
<TE>   INS planners contemplated a separate design in which the fence
would skirt a mesa containing the park's picnic area.</TE>
<TE>   But talks with state parks officials, who favored strengthening
the existing fence instead of building a second one, fizzled without
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Under the draft, the fence would cut through the picnic area 150
feet north of the fence now marking the international border.</TE>
<TE>   But the report could prompt fresh negotiations. The border agency
said it is open to further talks before a final version is issued
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Park attendance has dropped from 230,000 in 1994 to 45,000 in
2000. Access has been hampered by persistent drainage problems that
at times render park roads impassable.</TE>
<TE>   A $6-million project by the California Coastal Conservancy is set
to begin later this year to stem flooding by building sediment basins
and fixing the road.</TE>

<HD>After-School Effort May Continue to Expand</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fulfilling a pledge he made early in his administration, Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn announced Thursday that city officials and
business leaders have expanded a nationally acclaimed after-school
program to 101 elementary schools in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Since August, 23 more schools have added classes run by LA's BEST,
a public-private partnership that offers tutoring and enrichment
programs between 3 and 6 p.m. school days.</LD>
<LD>   The schools selected are in low-income communities where a large
percentage of the students qualify for federal lunch programs and
have low test scores.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to do everything we can for you today so your tomorrows
can be bright," Hahn told about 50 third-graders Thursday morning at
Arminita Elementary School in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the expansion was paid for by philanthropist Eli Broad,
whose foundation donated $1.73 million over three years.</TE>
<TE>   Broad helped raise another $1.1 million in donations to pay for
the new programs.</TE>
<TE>   The city contributed money from federal Community Development
Block Grants.</TE>
<TE>   Broad announced Thursday that he is committed to help expand the
program to another 20 schools. He did not specify how much money he
would give.</TE>
<TE>   Broad called LA's BEST "a proven winner" that provides academic
enrichment and extracurricular activities while keeping children in a
safe environment.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said during last year's mayoral campaign that he wants to
expand the program to every elementary school. About one-third of the
city's 322 elementary schools participate in LA's BEST, which serves
17,000 children.</TE>

<HD>Mother Is Given Probation in Deaths of 2 Sons Left in Auto</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge orders probation for Simi Valley woman who
pleaded no contest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After tearful pleas for leniency by her husband, a 40-year-old Simi
Valley mother was sentenced to probation Thursday for leaving her two
young sons in a sweltering minivan where they died last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Marlene Heath had faced up to 12 years in prison after pleading no
contest last fall in the Aug. 4 deaths of her sons, 3-year-old Jake
and his 13-month-old brother Dylan.</LD>
<LD>   Heath told police that she drank a bottle of wine, fell asleep in
her bedroom and found the children strapped in their car seats four
hours later.</LD>
<TE>   During her sentencing hearing Thursday, Phillip Heath, the
defendant's husband, pleaded for mercy before Superior Court Judge
Bruce A. Clark. Heath struggled to maintain his composure as he
described his wife as a loving mother and spouse who had long fought
to overcome alcoholism.</TE>
<TE>   "No father could have loved his two children like I loved my two
boys," Heath said. "Marlene was there 24 hours a day, seven days a
week." But prosecutor Susan Aramesh demanded that the judge send a
strong message to other parents of young children, saying that
Heath's actions directly led to the deaths of her children.</TE>
<TE>   "The two victims are not here," Aramesh told Clark. "It's them who
died from the heat. They could not get help from anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the prosecutor's description of the "torturous death"
inflicted on the two young children by their mother, the judge
decided that a prison sentence was not in order.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said he was swayed by defense statements submitted to the
court describing Heath as a near-desperate alcoholic who had managed
to emerge from an abyss of binge-drinking and blackouts since her
sons' deaths to start leading a productive life.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the judge said, setting her free on probation "was one of
the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. What thinking person
would ever lock her children in her car?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tragic situation," Clark said as a packed courtroom waited
for his ruling. "But it would not be a furtherance of justice to send
her to prison."</TE>
<TE>   His announcement was met with a loud chorus of cheers and applause
from those in the gallery as well as many of the jailhouse defendants
awaiting their hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Heath was ordered back to court Feb. 21 to learn the specific
terms of her probation.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Phillip Heath said Clark's ruling was correct and his
two sons "are up in heaven right now jumping up and down."</TE>
<TE>   Living Full Time in Drug Treatment Facility</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a black business suit and white blouse, Marlene Heath
embraced her husband and several friends before leaving the
courtroom. She was surrounded by nearly a dozen supporters as she
left the courthouse with her head down.</TE>
<TE>   Heath, who is now a full-time resident at a Ventura drug and
alcohol treatment facility, declined to comment before being led away
to a waiting van.</TE>
<TE>   According to a search warrant affidavit, Heath told police that
she purchased four bottles of wine on Aug. 3 and later drank one or
two bottles. The next morning, she began drinking again, consuming
one bottle of wine.</TE>
<TE>   Heath, a Kinko's employee, left for a company picnic in Ventura
about 1 p.m., but turned back. She estimated she pulled into the
driveway of her Ralston Avenue home about 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavit, she left the boys strapped in their
child safety seats with the windows rolled up and went into the house
to use the bathroom. She told investigators she remembers unlocking
the door, but nothing after that. Heath found her children dead
inside the minivan four hours later. The two boys died of
hyperthermia. The temperature outside was nearly 90 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   A blood test taken six hours after Heath's last drink registered
0.17% blood-alcohol level, more than twice the legal limit for
driving.</TE>
<TE>   Following Thursday's hearing, Aramesh expressed disappointment at
the judge's ruling. "If she had been pulled over while she was
driving around drunk she would have received more jail time than she
did for killing her two children," Aramesh said. "I guarantee if a
baby-sitter killed [the Heath children], they would have been asking
for prison."</TE>

<HD>Closer Look at Complaints on HMOs Urged</HD>
<DH>Regulation: State wants to review arbitration cases
involving patients, while industry representatives say it would be an
undue invasion of privacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California HMO regulators are seeking to expand their review of
arbitration cases involving patients, citing concerns about the
fairness of the process.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of Managed Health Care is proposing regulations
requiring HMOs to submit additional data so it can investigate
patients' complaints and look for patterns of abuse. Agency Director
Daniel Zingale said the secrecy of the current arbitration process
keeps even the regulators in the dark.</LD>
<LD>   "There's very serious reason to believe that the current system
gives HMOs an advantage over patients, and we need a closer look at
that," he said. "We want to create a more equal playing field for
patients."</LD>
<TE>   The department is reviewing public comments to the proposed
regulations and will submit them for final approval to the state
Office of Administrative Law. As proposed, the rules would:</TE>
<TE>   * Require HMOs to submit complete copies of all arbitration
decisions within 30 days of receiving them. Under current guidelines,
health plans need only provide the state with altered copies of
arbitration decisions that do not include the HMO's name, the
patient's name, the doctor's name or any other identifying
information.</TE>
<TE>   * Force all HMO arbitration settlements to include a clause
allowing patients to discuss their cases with regulators. In the
past, Zingale said, some patients have declined to answer regulators'
questions about their cases because they were afraid of violating
confidentiality agreements.</TE>
<TE>   HMOs say the proposed regulations would violate the privacy of
patients and constitute an additional--and unnecessary--regulatory
burden. They also say the state is exceeding its regulatory
authority.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of HMOs in California require consumers to
submit their grievances to arbitration rather than filing lawsuits.
Health plans say the out-of-court process is speedier, less
contentious and not subject to the variability of juries.</TE>
<TE>   Zingale said the arbitration process may be stacked against
patients because health plans select the firms that administer it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned that there may be an incentive for the contracted
decision-makers to lean in favor of the HMOs because those are the
repeat customers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the state's largest HMO, Kaiser Permanente, says it repeatedly
uses arbitrators who have sided with patients.</TE>
<TE>   The HMO industry trade group said Zingale's proposal is
unnecessary because arbitration cases are few and far between. "If
the department is looking for information on how the arbitration
process is working, what they're going to find is that there's not a
lot of data," said Walter Zelman, president of the California Assn.
of Health Plans.</TE>
<TE>   Zelman said most complaints are settled well before they reach
arbitration, either through an internal grievance process within an
HMO or through an independent medical review overseen by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Data released by the state show that most health plans received
few if any arbitration requests from January to October 2000. Blue
Cross of California received 135 requests, of which 127 were
withdrawn by patients or their lawyers before a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser receives hundreds of arbitration requests each year because
it owns its hospitals and has an exclusive relationship with a
physician group. The HMO, which pays the legal costs for its doctors
and hospitals, is typically named as a defendant in medical
malpractice claims.</TE>
<TE>   HMOs say Zingale's proposed regulations are overly intrusive.
"This constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy, breach of
confidentiality and is burdensome and oppressive on the plans," Long
Beach-based SCAN Health Plan wrote in comments submitted to the
state.</TE>
<TE>   But some consumer advocates praised Zingale's decision to collect
more information on the arbitration process. Although the number of
arbitrations is small, they say, the cases represent real patients
with real problems.</TE>
<TE>   "What the department has finally realized is that arbitration is
an iron curtain that the public can't see through and it only has
limited ability to see beyond," said Jamie Court, executive director
of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.</TE>
<TE>   Court's group supports a bill, approved by the state Senate last
year, that would allow HMO members to bypass the arbitration system
in some cases and file lawsuits in court.</TE>
<TE>   Current state law allows HMOs to require that consumers handle
virtually all grievances in a private arbitration system as a
condition of membership.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier), is
pending in the Assembly. Zingale said his office has not taken a
position on the legislation.</TE>

<HD>Traudl Junge, 81; Secretary Took Down Hitler's Will</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traudl Junge, who was one of Adolf Hitler's secretaries and took his
last will and testament, has died, just hours after a documentary on
her life premiered at the Berlin Film Festival. She was 81.</LD>
<LD>   She died of cancer overnight Sunday at a Munich hospital, festival
spokeswoman Silke Lehmann said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Junge was born Gertraud Humps in Munich in 1920, the daughter of
Max Humps, an early Nazi devotee. She applied for a secretarial job
in the Reich Chancellery in 1942 and became one of the Nazi
dictator's personal secretaries that December--just as World War II
was turning against Germany.</LD>
<TE>   In 1943, she married Hitler aide Hans Junge, who was killed a year
later when a British plane strafed his company in Normandy, France.</TE>
<TE>   Junge was with Hitler and his staff when they moved into an
underground bunker in Berlin in January 1945. As the end neared in
April 1945, Junge remembered increasingly ghostly scenes in the
bunker.</TE>
<TE>   That period is a focus of "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary," a
90-minute documentary that its Austrian director, Andre Heller,
billed as the most in-depth interview on film with Junge.</TE>
<TE>   She recalled Hitler sitting for long periods staring into the
distance.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything took place so unceremoniously," Junge said. "It was a
terrible time. I can't really remember my feelings. We were all in a
state of shock, like machines. It was an eerie atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   More controversially, she insisted that Hitler and other Nazi
leaders "practically never mentioned the word Jew" in her
presence--even though it was during the time she served Hitler that
most of the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis in the Holocaust died.</TE>
<TE>   She said she found out about the Holocaust only after the war, and
then felt racked with guilt for having liked "the greatest criminal
who ever lived."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center
in Los Angeles, called Junge's recollections "sheer fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   "In the history of the Third Reich, the argument is always the
same among those in the close circle around Hitler. They never heard
the horrible things. That is all basically revisionism," Hier said.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he got into power and maintained power was the war
against the Jews. Everyone who came into contact with him heard him
rant and rave about the Jews," Hier said.</TE>
<TE>   On April 28, 1945, two days before Hitler and his longtime
mistress Eva Braun committed suicide, the Fuehrer summoned Junge and
dictated his will.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Junge was taken into custody by the Soviet army,
then the Americans. She was released after being interrogated. She
continued to work in Germany as a secretary, and later as an editor
and journalist.</TE>
<TE>   Heller, who culled the footage from 10 hours of interviews at
Junge's tidy one-room flat in Munich, said she agreed to speak with
him because she knew she did not have long to live.</TE>
<TE>   Heller said she told him: "I have finally let go of my story. Now
I feel the world is letting go of me."</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: TRAUDL JUNGE: She worked with Hitler as they were
holed up in a Berlin bunker and his end drew near. She claimed not to
have known of the Holocaust until after the war. "I have finally let
go of my story. Now I feel the world is letting go of me," she told
an interviewer recently.</CP>

<HD>Prosecutors Request Gag Order in Rape Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutors are seeking a gag order in the case
against rape suspect Andrew Luster, saying recent out-of-court
statements by defense attorneys could taint the jury pool.</LD>
<LD>   The request comes after Luster's lawyers accused police and
prosecutors of withholding evidence they contend will exonerate their
millionaire client.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Roger Jon Diamond told reporters after a Jan. 31 hearing
that something "bizarre" was occurring and that defense attorneys
intended to get to the bottom of it.</LD>
<TE>   Eight days later, Deputy Dist. Attys. Anthony Wold and Ernesto
Acosta filed a motion requesting a gag order to prohibit prosecutors,
defense lawyers, witnesses and investigators from commenting on the
case.</TE>
<TE>   In their motion, Wold and Acosta accused the defense of engaging
in improper pretrial publicity in violation of state rules governing
lawyers' conduct.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that unfounded statements on alleged police corruption
could taint the jury pool and force the case to be moved outside
Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   This week Diamond defended his earlier remarks and said he intends
to fight any attempt to prevent the defense from speaking publicly
about the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think that is improper," Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond said his comments did not violate state rules because, he
said, they were made in response to earlier statements by officials
with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's
office.</TE>

<HD>NAACP Forum Will Discuss Slaying by Police</HD>
<DH>Long Beach: Several groups have raised concerns about the
death of the knife-wielding mentally ill woman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concern over the Jan. 19 police shooting of an African American woman
carrying a knife will be the focus of an NAACP public forum Sunday in
Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Police Chief Jerome E. Lance will attend the 3:30 p.m.
meeting at the California Recreation Park community center, 1550
Martin Luther King Jr. Ave.</LD>
<LD>   Concern about the shooting has mounted among civil rights
organizations, community groups ranging from environmentalists to
peace and park activists, and even self-described anarchists. There
have also been newspaper letters to the editor supporting the police
and questioning why the family did not ensure that Marcella Byrd
received treatment for her mental illness. The case is under
investigation by the department and the district attorney's
office--routine procedure after officer-involved deaths.</LD>
<TE>   Officials have said the three officers who fired their guns felt
endangered when Byrd raised the knife as if to throw it.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, 57, was fatally shot after as many as seven officers
repeatedly ordered her to stop and drop the knife and she refused,
police say. She had been shot moments before with two pellet-filled
miniature bean bags that did not deter her.</TE>
<TE>   Police were called because she left a market without paying for
groceries and, when confronted by store workers, reportedly
brandished a knife. She left the market premises without groceries.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, police found out that Byrd had schizophrenia,
for which her family says she refused to take medication and which
she denied having. Police say it was not her failure to follow
orders, however, but her raising of the knife that made officers feel
they had to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd's death has prompted what the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People described as an unprecedented number of
calls to the Long Beach chapter, and a protest by what police
estimated were 100 to 125 people who marched peacefully through the
city's downtown on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The family has filed a $25-million wrongful death claim against
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Another civil rights group, the Compton-based National Assn. for
Equal Justice in America, also is examining the case and said it has
met with police and Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP Long Beach chapter president said Thursday that she
hopes for a good turnout by the public and that those attending
"hopefully recommend positive, proactive solutions."</TE>
<TE>   "What I do want persons who attend the meeting to understand,"
said Naomi Rainey, "is that we realize that cases that are in
litigation cannot be [fully] discussed. However, we can share our
concerns, make recommendations. And also learn how we can be more
vigilant, proactive and involved in the decisions regarding the
policing of our community."</TE>
<TE>   The police chief has met with numerous community groups since the
shooting. Department spokesman Dave Marander said Thursday that Lance
will respond to what he can but that the wrongful death claim filed
by Byrd's family limits him.</TE>

<HD>12 Inmates Accused of Racketeering</HD>
<DH>Crime: Suspected gang members face charges including
murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dozen suspected members of the Nazi Low Riders, a white racist
prison gang, have been indicted on federal racketeering charges that
include allegations of murder, robbery, witness intimidation,
extortion and drug dealing, authorities announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   All of those charged have been in custody, either awaiting trial
or serving time in the California penal system.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment, which was returned by a Los Angeles federal grand
jury Wednesday, capped a three-year investigation into the Low
Riders.</LD>
<TE>   According to the indictment, the Low Riders have now succeeded the
Aryan Brotherhood as the dominant white gang in California's state
prison yards.</TE>
<TE>   The change is an outgrowth of a systemwide "lockdown" of Aryan
Brotherhood members, cutting them off from access to the general
inmate population, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   In return for getting "the keys to the yard," the indictment said,
the Nazi Low Riders now serve as chief enforcers for the Aryan
Brotherhood.</TE>
<TE>   It said they have formed strategic alliances with other prison
gangs, including the Mexican Mafia. Those indicted are accused of
carrying out one murder and 19 attempted murders behind prison walls.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bridge, 34, identified as a high-level Nazi Low Rider, and
Robert Baltimore, 32, described as a soldier in the organization,
were charged with killing an inmate in 1996. Both are eligible for
the death penalty if convicted under the racketeering charge.</TE>
<TE>   Eight other defendants face maximum life terms and two could be
sentenced to up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was conducted by a task force headed by the FBI
and the Ontario Police Department with assistance from the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the California Department of
Corrections; the Orange County Sheriff's Department; and the Costa
Mesa Police Department.</TE>

<HD>But Did the Note-Writing Housekeeper Take the Homeowner to
the Cleaners?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Alamitos News-Enterprise gave "Call of the Week" honors in
its police log to this item: "A woman returned home to find her home
cleaned and a note stating the housekeeper had been there."</LD>
<LD>   The police log added: "But she doesn't have a housekeeper."</LD>
<LD>   Slamming into reverse: Rod Casper of L.A. found a sign in South
Pasadena that I think would characterize the driving in most parking
lots in these parts (see photo). (It actually refers to a company
called Alert Communications.)</LD>
<TE>   True comfort food: Barbara Fox of Altadena noticed a cereal name
that she figures is for "blue Mondays" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   More food for thought: S.B. Alper of Huntington Beach spotted a
meat dish that is cooked extremely rare (see accompanying). Heavy on
the brandy, please.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, Earl Scheib: The item here about the anti-Grey-Poupon
Rolls-Royce with the NO MSTRD license plate reminded Jack Conway "of
a [stainless steel] Delorean that we saw. Its plate read NOPAINT."</TE>
<TE>   The plate on my old Ford Fairlane could have said the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Hearsay: In the Laguna Niguel News, resident Deloris St. John came
upon this alarming crime log entry: "Someone reported that a man was
sitting in a parked vehicle listening to very loud Italian opera."</TE>
<TE>   Perfect job for a ham: "While walking on Ocean Front Walk at
Venice Beach," writes Ed Stalcup of Malibu, "we saw an actor-type
standing with a cell phone in one hand and, in the other, a sign
saying, 'Slice of Pizza 99 cents.' As we passed, we heard him say
into the phone, 'Well, I'm on this gig right now.'"</TE>
<TE>   If he gets good reviews, maybe he can win a part in a spaghetti
western.</TE>
<TE>   What do you expect from such a rowdy sport? The Laguna News-Post
reported:</TE>
<TE>   "Cliff Drive, 400 block, public intoxication. Residents said it
appeared that a man was passed out near the lawn bowling green at
Heisler Park."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like ... You may have seen that Sprint cell phone
commercial that warns of the danger of bad connections: A football
coach making a personnel move tells his assistant via phone that he
"needs a backup for O'Neill." The next day, the assistant brings to
practice the Captain and Tennille.</TE>
<TE>   David Chan of L.A. says that a takeoff making the rounds among
accountants has an Arthur Andersen exec saying on his cell phone,
"Ship the Enron documents to the feds." But his secretary hears, "Rip
the Enron documents to shreds."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I panicked when Diana Britt of Pasadena sent me an
e-mail that mentioned my name in conjunction with Jerry Lerman's
bonehead.oddballs.com Web site. I breathed easier when I discovered
that the bonehead was a stupid criminal mentioned in this column, not
me. At least not that day.</TE>

<HD>On This Stretch, Palm Trees Mean Something</HD>

<LD>Palm trees on Bristol Street, smack in the middle of Santa Ana? What
is this, Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills? What's next, a Gucci store to
replace the Bristol Swap Mall?</LD>
<LD>   All right, not to get too carried away with my own metaphor, but
there's the whiff of change in the air and right now it's coming from
the asphalting on Bristol, where the city of Santa Ana is widening
the street, putting in a permanent median and planting trees.</LD>
<LD>   That's done every day in America, but not that often in low-income
neighborhoods where many residents speak limited English and don't
have lots of money to spend. That's why you've got to like the look
on the street these days.</LD>
<TE>   It's as if the project itself is saying, "OK, you're hard-working
people. We're going to give you a better-looking street."</TE>
<TE>   That, at least, is the opinion I get from several merchants and
residents in the area. Art Lopez was standing outside his favorite
Bristol Street doughnut shop Thursday morning, watching the street
crew.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city decided to fix a street in the middle of town,
instead of where the money is," he says. "Obviously, it's going to
look nice. When you see it at night and it's lighted up, it looks
great."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez lives in Santa Ana and runs a custodial business. "This is
my 'hood," he says. I ask about the palm trees and the Beverly Hills
look. "The closest I've been to Beverly Hills is South Pasadena," he
says. "This looks similar to that."</TE>
<TE>   I ask if he feels neighborhood pride because of the
beautification. "I think I feel proud of what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   A strip mall on Bristol between Edinger and McFadden is being
heavily affected by the construction project. Several merchants I
talked to can't wait for the road work to end, but all think it will
be worth it.</TE>
<TE>   Sang Park runs the 45 Minute Foto Studio in the mall. Aside from
improving the aesthetics of the area, he thinks the Bristol Street
project will have a positive effect on the outlook of the residents
in this low- to middle-income neighborhood only 21/2 miles north of
South Coast Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here 41/2 years," he says. "I never knew about Mexican
society and community. I never thought there would be this kind of
community in the U.S. Some people here don't even know where South
Coast Plaza is. Instead of going to Costco or Wal-Mart, they go to
the swap meet."</TE>
<TE>   He thinks the beautification project will, in time, bring better
opportunities to the neighborhood and expand the horizons of area
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Flores agrees. A longtime neighborhood resident, he raises
his palm upward to describe what the street-widening has done to the
value of his home. Plus, he likes the look. "It was too ugly before,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Agreed, says Kyung Lee, who runs the swap meet in the mall. She
concedes that the aging storefronts don't exactly match the new look
of the street, but she likes the renovations. Her only problem, as
she stood on the sidewalk and watched traffic inch along in the
construction zone, was how long it's taking.</TE>
<TE>   "The residents say it is beautiful," she says. "Before, it was a
little dirty, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell if there's a connection between beautifying a
street and improving people's lives. But we know the city could have
simply widened Bristol and skipped the aesthetics. I tip my hat to
them for not skimping.</TE>
<TE>   Souri Amirani, the Bristol Street project manager, says the city
had planned for a long time to widen the thoroughfare and then
decided to throw in some other improvements, such as landscaping and
a linear park. She also hastens to tell me that palm trees grow in
other parts of Santa Ana too.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after having driven up Bristol Street so many times ...</TE>
<TE>   "You're not used to seeing palm trees in the middle of the street
in Santa Ana," Art Lopez says.</TE>
<TE>   That's true, I say. I count 28 of them between Edinger and
McFadden, and Amirani says more are coming.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think of them?" I ask Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I like them," he says.</TE>

<LD>Arnold Mostowicz, 87, who treated victims of Nazi brutality in one of
Poland's largest ghettos during World War II and chronicled his
experience in several books, died Feb. 3 in Warsaw after a long
illness.</LD>
<LD>   Born in the central Poland city of Lodz, which before World War II
was the home of the country's second-largest Jewish community,
Mostowicz treated fellow Jews who were forced into the Lodz ghetto.</LD>
<LD>   He also played an active role in the Resistance movement. After
the ghetto was eliminated, he was sent to Auschwitz.</LD>
<TE>   Mostowicz worked as a journalist and author after the war. He
gained international attention for writing and narrating a 1999
documentary about the Lodz ghetto called ''Fotoamator'' (''The
Photographer'').</TE>
<TE>   The film was based on 400 color slides taken by Walter Genewein,
who was the Austrian chief accountant of the Lodz ghetto for the
Nazis. The pictures were discovered in 1987.</TE>

<LD>Remo Palmier, 78, a jazz guitarist who performed with Coleman
Hawkins, Charlie Parker and Billie Holiday, died Saturday in New York
City of complications from leukemia and lymphoma.</LD>

Christian.</LD>
<LD>   But in later years he adopted the melodic and harmonic concepts of
saxophonists Hawkins and Parker.</LD>
<TE>   In 1945, he began a 27-year period as guitarist for the "Arthur
Godfrey Show." It was reported widely that he taught Godfrey how to
play the ukulele.</TE>

formed a group with pianist Hank Jones.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as an accompanist for singer Pearl Bailey, played a
series of concerts with Benny Goodman and later appeared at various
festivals in California.</TE>

<LD>Ong Teng Cheong, 66, the first elected president of Singapore, died
Feb. 8 at his home after a 10-year battle with lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Singapore, Ong was educated at the Chinese High School,

<HD>Parks Lashes Out After Censure</HD>
<DH>Politics: Thousand Oaks councilwoman alleges the vote by
colleagues Wednesday was timed to harm her campaign for county
supervisor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after she was censured by her colleagues, Thousand Oaks City
Councilwoman Linda Parks lashed out Thursday at the three councilmen
who targeted her, charging that their actions were intended to hurt
her bid next month for a seat on the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an absolutely groundless attack with no basis other than
the fact that they want to end my political career," Parks said.
"It's because I'm very effective at what I do, which is working to
keep urban sprawl out. I'm a slow-growther and they're
pro-development."</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Ed Masry agreed, saying that the council's action was done
to discredit her and that she should wear it "as a badge of honor."</LD>
<TE>   Despite vehement protests from dozens of Parks' supporters,
councilmen Dan Del Campo, Andy Fox and Dennis Gillette voted 3 to 2
Wednesday night to censure Parks and oust planning commissioners
Michael Farris and Nora Aidukas while alleging they conspired to
stall a controversial land-swap deal.</TE>
<TE>   The council majority had accused the three of improperly trying to
obstruct the deal with developers to keep Parks from having to take a
stand on the issue until after the March 5 election. The council also
voted Wednesday to ask the district attorney to investigate the
commission for possible violations of the state's open meetings law.</TE>
<TE>   But Parks and her supporters charge that the council majority is
trying to cover up the possibility that the complex land deal may not
be valid without voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, a 191-acre swath of an area known as the
Western Plateau would be preserved as open space. In exchange for the
land, developers could build more expensive housing in place of 225
senior and affordable units in the Dos Vientos area.</TE>
<TE>   Development at Heart of Dispute</TE>
<TE>   The deal put Parks in a difficult position, the reason it was
necessary that a council vote be delayed, according to her
detractors.</TE>
<TE>   If she voted for the deal, she might be accused of assisting
developers, and if she opposed the plan, it could hurt her reputation
as a protector of open space, they said.</TE>
<TE>   But Parks had argued for weeks that, according to the city's own
maps, part of the land involved in the Western Plateau proposal is
covered by a city ordinance that requires voter approval before it
can be developed.</TE>
<TE>   City lawyers and planning staff disagree, however, saying those
land-use maps contained a printing error and that the correct maps
would allow the city to strike a deal directly with developers.</TE>
<TE>   Parks acknowledges that she addressed her concerns with Farris and
Aidukas--which is permitted by law--and that she and Aidukas made
photocopies of the maps together. But she says she spoke with
commissioners individually and never pressured them to take any
specific action.</TE>
<TE>   Farris, Aidukas and Commissioner Claudia Bill-de la Pena each
raised questions about the accuracy of the city's maps during the
commission's meeting Monday night. They voted 3 to 2 to postpone
action by a week to gather more information.</TE>
<TE>   The action prompted City Council members to level accusations that
Parks and the commissioners conspired to stall the deal. Convinced
that the panel's action was predetermined, a majority of the council
called a special meeting Wednesday to censure Parks and to dismiss
the two planning commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said she will propose putting the plateau deal before city
voters. If the council rejects her, land-use attorney Richard
Francis, who drafted Ventura County's slow-growth laws, has
volunteered to take the matter to court.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is scheduled to vote on the deal Feb. 26, but
first the Planning Commission must issue a recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman May Use Censure in Campaign</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the council voted to fill one of the vacancies on
the planning panel with former Planning Commissioner Forrest Frields,
Del Campo's appointee. Parks suggested several replacements for
Aidukas, her appointee, but none was approved.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, millionaire businessman Randy Hoffman, Parks' opponent
in the March 5 supervisorial race, said he supported the council's
actions Wednesday night and might well attack Parks in the final
weeks of the campaign for being censured.</TE>
<TE>   "Linda Parks continually is caught doing things that are suspect,
that are in this case plain wrong, and her and her supporters attempt
to point the finger at other people," he said. "It's ludicrous."</TE>

<HD>Power Agency Leans Green</HD>
<DH>Plan: Instead of building gas-fired plants or taking over
wires, the authority decides it will broker renewable energy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Created in the midst of the electricity crisis by lawmakers who gave
it vague duties, the state power authority at 6 months of age says it
has found its calling as a champion of clean, green power.</LD>
<LD>   In an ''investment plan'' approved unanimously by its five-member
board Thursday, the authority charts a far more limited future than
originally envisioned.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as September, the agency had considered building small
gas-fired power plants. Under the new vision, it would not own plants
or take over transmission wires. Instead, it would serve as a banker
and broker to get more windmills, rooftop solar panels and
power-sipping appliances installed across California.</LD>
<TE>   ''We've injected a bit of humility into this draft,'' said S.
David Freeman, chairman of the California Consumer Power and
Conservation Financing Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The plan approved Thursday suggests that California should have a
buffer of 15% more electricity than projected demand, not 22%. The
authority also shrank the amount of additional power generation and
conservation capacity it proposed to help build by 2006, from 8,000
megawatts to 3,500 megawatts. (For comparison's sake, California's
peak electricity consumption last year was 48,500 megawatts). And the
agency dropped its proposal to ask the Legislature for stronger
authority to take over private power projects.</TE>
<TE>   The blueprint tries to reassure independent energy companies,
saying the authority ''has no interest or desire to displace any
private enterprise in California.''</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and consumer activists praised the plan. But the
state's private utilities, whose customers are expected to pay for
much of the agency's $5 billion worth of projects, expressed serious
reservations.</TE>
<TE>   In written comments, Southern California Edison officials said
they see little or no need over the next four years for more power
plants than those already under construction. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
argues that the burden of paying for more renewable energy production
in California should not fall on private utility customers alone.</TE>
<TE>   California's electricity situation has changed radically since the
Legislature voted to create a public power authority last winter.
Once threatened with blackouts and out-of-control prices, state
officials today have so much electricity under contract that they
often sell it at a loss.</TE>
<TE>   That reality helped convince the authority to check its ambition.</TE>
<TE>   The California Energy Commission predicts a need for 8,000
megawatts of new supply or additional conservation over the next
decade in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Private power plants supplying about 3,000 megawatts--enough to
serve 2.25 million homes--are likely to be finished in a year or two.
Many other projects are in the permitting process, although recent
upheaval in the industry has halted some of them.</TE>
<TE>   By choosing to finance 775 megawatts of power production that
doesn't burn natural gas or oil, the authority would help the state
achieve a goal of having 20% of its power come from clean sources
such as hydropower, solar and wind.</TE>
<TE>   The power authority would also finance programs that could, on
short notice, take 2,100 megawatts off the electrical grid. The
program would work through the installation of sensors at businesses
that get paid to allow grid operators to curtail air conditioners or
other equipment when electricity supplies get tight.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 625 megawatts in energy savings could come from the
''greening'' of public buildings, such as the installation of solar
panels on school roofs.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Doll, the authority's chief executive officer, said that by
this summer she hopes to go to Wall Street with a package of
projects. The agency is authorized to borrow $5 billion in revenue
bonds. To ensure that the bonds get paid back, each project the
agency finances must generate supporting revenue.</TE>

<LD>A Port Hueneme strip mall was evacuated Thursday and later closed
after portions of a restaurant's roof sagged and nearly collapsed,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   No one was injured in the incident, which began about 10:24 a.m.
inside the Roxbury Deli and Grill in the 400 block of Channel Islands
Boulevard, said Joe Luna, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire
Department.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 18 people were inside when several customers "heard
some creaking and moaning" and saw the ing sagging and tiles
shifting, Luna said.</LD>
<TE>   Four other businesses were evacuated as building inspectors and
members of the urban search and rescue team inspected the building
for damage, Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   The building has been red-tagged and deemed unsafe, he said.</TE>

<HD>DWP Blames Rebate Delays on Backlog</HD>
<DH>Energy: Buyers of heating, cooling systems have waited for
months for their money. Officials cite greater than expected demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rebates promised by Los Angeles for new energy-saving heating and
cooling systems have been delayed for months by an unexpected
backlog, frustrating residents and contractors.</LD>
<LD>   About 2,000 customers who applied for rebates under the Department
of Water and Power program are still waiting.</LD>
<LD>   In response, the DWP plans to deploy a task force next week to
process the applications.</LD>
<TE>   Fueled by California's energy crunch last year, more than 7,500
residential and commercial customers who installed the new systems
applied for the rebates--six times more than DWP officials expected.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been pretty much swamped," said Steve Matsuda, an assistant
director at the DWP. "When we started we anticipated a good level of
participation, with maybe a couple of thousand jobs for the year.
Then with the energy crisis, there was a lot greater interest. We got
unprecedented response."</TE>
<TE>   The delays have plagued contractors such as Brett Hoffer of
Conditioned Aire in Northridge, who said he gets calls from angry
customers demanding to know when their checks will arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to know where their money is, and I don't blame them.
Some of them have been waiting six or seven months," Hoffer said. "My
business is 95% referrals, so this could really hurt our reputation.
It's making us look bad."</TE>
<TE>   The rebate program offers financial incentives to heating and
air-conditioning contractors for installing systems with energy
efficiency levels that exceed current requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The rebates, which contractors pass on to customers, range from
$600 to $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They were large incentives--the largest we've ever paid," Matsuda
said.</TE>
<TE>   State funding helped boost rebate amounts, which are determined by
the size and energy efficiency of the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The program requires that installations be verified by telephone
or field inspection, which also slows things down, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation has frustrated customers such as Thomas Morton of
North Hills, whose new system was installed Aug. 15 and who is still
awaiting his check.</TE>
<TE>   Morton said the hefty rebate was the deciding factor that prompted
him to buy a more energy-efficient unit rather than service his old
one.</TE>
<TE>   "It was definitely an incentive, but I probably wouldn't have
bought the new unit if I knew it would take this long to get the
rebate," Morton said. "I mean, how long does it take to cut a check?"</TE>
<TE>   The current rebate program concludes at the end of March, when DWP
officials expect to consider new incentive plans.</TE>

device did not explode.</LD>
<LD>   Corey also is a suspect in an explosion at the Hall of Justice on
Feb. 6. In that incident, the explosive device was placed in a paper
dispenser in another restroom. The blast blew off a stall door, but

<HD>Secession Group's Estimates Disputed</HD>
<DH>Finances: Rival organization One Los Angeles calls Valley
VOTE's projections of law enforcement costs 'dangerous fabrications.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An anti-secession group disputed projected law enforcement costs for
a new San Fernando Valley city Thursday, accusing its rival group of
fabricating numbers to build voter support.</LD>
<LD>   One Los Angeles, a group formed last October, took the first swing
at pro-secession Valley VOTE by issuing a critical report on proposed
law enforcement for a new city.</LD>
<LD>   It is the first of at least three reports by the group evaluating
major issues, such as taxes and utilities, surrounding the cityhood
proposal.</LD>
<TE>   The three-page report countered statements by Valley VOTE
President Jeff Brain that contracting with the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department would cost $80 million less than the cost of
services currently provided by the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The savings would be reflected in diminished services for the
area, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department patrols with one deputy per car, not two
like the LAPD, said Larry Levine, a co-founder of One Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   There would be no senior lead officers, motorcycle patrols, SWAT
team or helicopter patrols in the new Valley city under Valley VOTE's
proposed law enforcement budget, Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get them from the sheriff, but it costs more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said that he and other volunteers based their analysis on
the same two-page letter from the sheriff's contract law enforcement
bureau to the county's Local Agency Formation Commission that Brain
has cited in his speeches in support of the secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   The report concludes that Valley VOTE's statements on a proposed
sheriff's contract are "outright and knowingly dangerous fabrications
with no basis in fact."</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Close of Valley VOTE said the figures were released by
LAFCO, not his group.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are not satisfied, they should go back to the Sheriff's
Department," Close said. He said the letter was not intended to be a
contract proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Close said the decision rests with newly elected city officials,
who could create their own police force or contract with the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   One Los Angeles found fault with those options too.</TE>
<TE>   The group concluded that sticking with the LAPD for services
defeats the purpose of secession.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are happy with LAPD law enforcement, then why secede?"
Levine asked.</TE>
<TE>   He said creating a new police force is "outlandishly expensive."</TE>
<TE>   But Close disputed those costs, saying the city of L.A. would have
to give the new city some of its facilities and patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   He also suggested that the new city could create its own police
commission to oversee LAPD officers assigned there.</TE>

<HD>Odor Tied to Capped Oil Well in South L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The source of a bad odor first noticed Wednesday from the South Bay
coast to Redlands was identified Thursday as a methane and hydrogen
sulfide buildup that breached a capped oil well in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   After evacuating residents of 114 apartments for the second day in
a row, county hazard specialists said they ordered Geo Petroleum,
which owns the well, to remove about 1,000 square feet of
contaminated earth and burn off any residue of gaseous liquids.</LD>
<LD>   By late afternoon Thursday, everyone was back in their homes.</LD>
<TE>   Harold Johnson, a worker at the Gateway City Lights Apartments
near El Segundo Boulevard and the Harbor Freeway, said that at the
height of the emissions, smoke detectors went off in the apartments,
and some residents took their children who felt ill to hospital
emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Nosa Omoruyi, a senior hazardous materials specialist with the Los
Angeles County Fire Department, said that although the well had been
capped and out of use for some time, pockets of gas had accumulated
gradually in what he called "the well cellar," until pressure
amounted to about 400 pounds per square inch.</TE>
<TE>   Recent rains, he said, may have raised the water table,
compressing the gas toward the surface, and on Wednesday it burst
through the capped well. Winds then carried the odor long distances.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrogen sulfide in large amounts can be dangerous, Omoruyi said.</TE>
<TE>   But in this case, it was mixed with other petroleum gases and
never achieved dangerous concentrations for breathing or perhaps
fire, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some soccer players in nearby Athens Park, however, reported
headaches, and apartment residents next to the Geo Petroleum property
felt ill.</TE>
<TE>   Because of fears of a terrorist attack, there was a full response
by police, fire, air-quality and other officials.</TE>
<TE>   Omoruyi said that in addition to discovering the underground gas
buildup, hazard specialists had found some mercury contamination, and
that too would be cleaned up.</TE>

<HD>Suit Aims at Rights of Speech</HD>
<DH>Education: Students of South O.C. Community College
District allege its policies on expression are unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three students have sued South Orange County Community College
District, challenging the constitutionality of its free-speech policy
outlining how, when and where students air their views.</LD>
<LD>   It marks the fourth time the district has been sued over the
policy in the last four years, said Wendy Phillips, attorney for the
students.</LD>
<LD>   In the three previous cases, Phillips said, federal judges have
struck down portions of the district's policies and ordered it to pay
the plaintiffs' legal fees.</LD>
<TE>   The current policy prohibits students from engaging in a variety
of free-speech activities without permission from the district
chancellor or presidents of the district's two colleges, the lawsuit
alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Activities requiring approval include distributing leaflets,
posting something on a bulletin board, putting up a banner and using
a loudspeaker at a rally.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles by
Irvine Valley College students Deb Burbridge, James Irvine and Pourya
Khademi. Khademi also takes classes at Saddleback, the other college
in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Also sued are the district's seven-member board of trustees, two
of whom are lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   District spokeswoman Pam Zanelli did not return calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The board approved its 31-page policy in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "The policy is replete with unconstitutional statements," Phillips
alleged. For example, she said, it says that if a conflict arises
between the 1st Amendment and California law, state law takes
precedence.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1st Amendment, permission should not be needed to speak
in a public place, Phillips said. "A college campus is a
well-established public forum," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, she said, the policy allows anyone who objects to a bulletin
board item to remove it.</TE>
<TE>   That, the lawsuit says, "is even more pernicious as it authorizes
anyone to act as a rogue censor. This provision is an unparalleled
hecklers' veto."</TE>
<TE>   The district has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars defending
itself in court in recent years, losing most cases.</TE>
<TE>   Besides challenging its free-speech policies, lawsuits have
attempted to punish a professor for negative comments in his faculty
newsletter about Raghu Mathur, who recently was promoted from Irvine
Valley president to district chancellor.</TE>

<HD>Plea Bargains in O.C. Increase in Third-Strike Cases</HD>
<DH>Crime: Under D.A. Tony Rackauckas, fewer repeat offenders
getting 25-to-life, which mirrors a statewide trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas took office three
years ago, the number of three-strikes cases settled with plea
bargains has increased significantly, prompting debate over whether
his policies are furthering justice or obstructing it.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, according to an analysis of court and state
records, Orange County has had a sharp decline in the number of
repeat felons receiving life sentences, recording the biggest drop in
the state in the years since Rackauckas became district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas took office with the promise that he would lift his
predecessor's longtime ban on prosecutors participating in plea
bargains. The move has been hailed by many judges and prosecutors for
streamlining court operations and better ensuring that punishment
fits the crime. But critics said the new policy skirts the law's
intent and creates the potential of innocent defendants being coerced
into taking deals.</LD>
<TE>   A Times review of more than 1,000 Orange County three-strikes
case--those in which some felons face life in prison for a third
conviction--found that under the Rackauckas administration:</TE>
<TE>   * Nearly 90% of the three-strikes cases were resolved without
trials--a significant increase over Rackauckas' predecessor, Michael
Capizzi.</TE>
<TE>   * Nine out of 10 three-strikes cases resolved during Rackauckas'
first three years in office ended without the defendant receiving the
maximum sentence, 25 years to life in prison. The vast
majority--90%--of those sentences were signed off by prosecutors as
part of plea agreements.</TE>
<TE>   * Orange County's record is part of a statewide trend of fewer
three-strikes defendants getting life sentences. From 1996 to 2000,
the number of repeat offenders in Orange County sentenced to life
declined from 78 to 29--a 63% decline. In Los Angeles, the number
dropped by 44% and statewide by 39%, according to the California
Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' pledge to lift his predecessor's plea bargaining ban
was a central part of his 1998 campaign for district attorney, and
his record is expected to come under scrutiny as he faces a tough
reelection challenge from veteran prosecutor Wallace Wade.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said his policies have made the system more judicious.
He said his prosecutors are tough on repeat offenders who commit
serious crimes but show a sense of proportion to offenders whose
third strike is for a minor offense, like drug possession. He
criticized Capizzi for often seeking maximum punishment regardless of
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's why I decided to run. They were dragging in people who
shouldn't get 25 to life and committing an injustice," Rackauckas
said. "We're looking at the case and deciding what the proper
sentence is and saying that's what we want and that's what we're
going to demand."</TE>
<TE>   It's now common for Orange County prosecutors to propose dropping
the law's 25-to-life sentence if defendants plead guilty and accept
reduced prison terms. And while that's one way to avoid imposing the
stiff sentence on small-time criminals, some defense lawyers fear the
emphasis on plea bargaining might cause some innocent defendants to
take a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like putting a gun to the client's head," said Santa Ana
criminal defense attorney Richard Schwartzberg. The potential dangers
of this, critics said, was highlighted during the Los Angeles Police
Department Rampart Division scandal when several suspects who had
been framed by officers pleaded guilty to crimes they didn't commit
out of fear of the three-strikes life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Wade, Rackauckas' challenger, raises another criticism: That the
plea bargain policy violates the spirit--and the letter--of the
three-strikes law that voters overwhelmingly approved.</TE>
<TE>   California's three-strikes law has been highly controversial from
the moment it took effect nearly eight years ago. The law requires
the first two strikes to be certain serious or violent crimes, like
rape, murder or robbery. But the third strike can be for any felony,
including petty theft or possession of a single piece of rock
cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   The courts have lessened the impact of the law. In 1996, the
California Supreme Court ruled that judges do not have to impose the
25-to-life sentence in certain circumstances. And a federal appeals
court ruled this month that sending someone to prison for life for a
petty theft is "cruel and unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the three-strikes law have proposed a change that
would require a third strike to be a serious or violent crime.
Meanwhile, the number of repeat offenders receiving life sentences is
decreasing statewide--with the biggest decrease in Orange County,
according to state Department of Corrections files.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis of Orange County's three-strikes cases found that the
number of repeat offenders receiving life sentences has been steadily
declining during Rackauckas' term. In 1998, the last year Capizzi was
in office, 65 repeat felons were sentenced to life, according state
records. The number dropped to 62 in 1999, 29 in 2000 and 20 during
the first 10 months of 2001, the most recent records. Prosecutors
signed off on 90% of the three-strikes sentences over the last three
years. The remaining 10% of cases went to trial, with the judge
ultimately deciding the defendants' sentences</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said his prosecutors continue to pursue the 25 years to
life sentence for offenders whose conduct shows they remain a danger
to society.</TE>
<TE>   The DA's predecessor, Capizzi, prohibited prosecutors from plea
bargaining. For a case to be settled without a trial, the judge and
the defense attorney would have to hammer out a deal on their own,
with the prosecutor playing no role in the negotiations. Judges
loudly complained about the policy, which they said backlogged the
system and put too much of the burden of resolving cases on them.</TE>
<TE>   Now, under Rackauckas, prosecutors can negotiate freely with
defense lawyers. In the first three years he has been in office,
about 90% of three-strikes cases were resolved without trials.</TE>
<TE>   In Capizzi's last three years in office, roughly 77% of
three-strikes cases were resolved without trial, mainly  through
negotiation between judges and defense attorneys.</TE>

<CX>   Three-strikes plea bargains--A Feb. 15 story in the California
section about the rising number of Orange County three-strikes cases
resolved with plea bargains misstated the percentage of plea bargains

<HD>Valley Is L.A.'s Melting Pot, Report Finds</HD>
<DH>Demographics: Backers of secession say the study shows that
the effort to split L.A. is about fixing government, not about 'white
flight.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's San Fernando Valley is a multiethnic "epicenter" where people
live and work in some of the most diverse and rapidly changing
neighborhoods in Los Angeles, a new study says.</LD>
<LD>   One-third of the Valley's population is foreign-born, nearly 40%
is Latino, and while the white population has slightly declined in
the last decade, both the Latino and Asian populations have boomed.</LD>
<LD>   The old Valley was solidly middle-class. Today, many Valley
residents are aspiring to reach the middle class, and they're as
likely to come from Central America, Mexico, Thailand or China as the
Midwest.</LD>
<TE>   At a Van Nuys news conference, the study's author connected the
findings to the debate over Valley secession, in which some secession
opponents have argued that separating from Los Angeles would be a
form of "white flight." About 45% of the Valley's population is
white.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope that this will dispel the idea that secession is a
racial issue. It is an issue of governing, of what works and what
doesn't," said Joel Kotkin, a senior research fellow at the Davenport
Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University.</TE>
<TE>   Kotkin, an urban affairs writer, said he has taken no stance on
secession. Neither has the nonprofit Economic Alliance of the San
Fernando Valley, which commissioned the report from Pepperdine. The
alliance's chairman, however, is Studio City lawyer David Fleming,
who has been a major financial supporter of the secessionist group
Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   According to the study, titled "The Changing Face of the San
Fernando Valley," the region of 1.7 million is a more ethnically
diverse place than the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The other side of the hill is becoming much more like Manhattan,
more bifurcated," with poor and rich neighborhoods sharply divided
and more single people and couples without children, Kotkin said.</TE>
<TE>   People move their families to the Valley because housing in many
of its neighborhoods remains more affordable than in other parts of
the city. In the Valley, middle-class people can still buy homes and
have backyards for their children, Kotkin said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Neighborhoods Often More Diverse</TE>
<TE>   And while the Valley has poor, largely segregated neighborhoods,
such as Pacoima, many neighborhoods are very mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than being made up of distinct ethnic pockets, much of the
Valley is cross-quilted, with middle-class and working-class pockets
often in close proximity, a nuance lost in statistical averages and
medians," the study states.</TE>
<TE>   Everto Ruiz, a Chicano Studies professor at Cal State Northridge
and a lifelong San Fernando city resident, said at the news
conference that he felt out of place when he arrived at CSUN as a
student in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "The place was rather new to me, and I felt that I was new to
them," he said. "But it's much different today.... We surely saw that
we were going to be living with each other, so it would do us well to
get to know each other."</TE>
<TE>   The study, which draws heavily on census data and the work of
previously published articles, was commissioned as part of Vision
2020, the alliance's effort to map out a vision for the area.</TE>
<TE>   Vision Statement Due Next Week</TE>
<TE>   For the past six months, 400 leaders and representatives of groups
and communities throughout the Valley have been working on the vision
statement, which will be released next Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Kotkin said he hoped the updated demographics will help the
Valley's population come together.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley is not America's suburb. It's not Valley girls....
It's a very diverse, cosmopolitan place, and it needs to find a
common purpose," Kotkin said.</TE>

<HD>Battering Ram Ends 8-Hour Standoff</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An eight-hour standoff with a man who allegedly fired shots near the
Harbor Freeway ended about 7 a.m. Thursday when a police SWAT team
used an armored battering ram to smash into the South Los Angeles
home in which he was hiding.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police spokesmen said that Clifford Jones, 40, was
taken into custody soon after screaming, "I want to surrender! I want
to surrender!"</LD>
<LD>   Before the battering ram was brought in, police used tear gas, but
Jones did not respond to it, Sgt. John Zamora said.</LD>
<TE>   The episode began about 10:45 p.m. Wednesday when someone fired at
officers and then went into hiding in a house in the 300 block of
West 98th Street.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing the shots could hit vehicles on the freeway, police closed
the northbound lanes from Century Boulevard to Manchester Avenue,
snarling traffic more than three miles. Some local residents took
shelter in two Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses during the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday evening, prosecutors had not decided what Jones
would be charged with.</TE>

<HD>Troubled Tollway to Get Financial Review</HD>
<DH>Transit: Frustrated by low ridership and revenue, San
Joaquin Hills board votes to hire a consultant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Operators of the San Joaquin Hills toll road Thursday agreed to hire
an independent consultant to study the highway's economic problems
and determine how to keep the coastal Orange County turnpike solvent.</LD>
<LD>   The tollway's board of directors unanimously approved a proposal
by chairwoman Linda Lindholm to hire an outside firm to complete a
financial analysis of the 15-mile highway that runs from Newport
Beach to San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   "I would like a second set of eyes for our board," Lindholm said.
"We need to take some positive steps to improve the economic future
for Highway 73. The financial news is not good right now."</LD>
<TE>   The measure grants board members the power to create a hiring
committee and seek proposals from national transportation consultants
with experience in toll road financing. The contract amount is not to
exceed $50,000, and whoever is hired will answer to the board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   Lindholm, a Laguna Niguel councilwoman, called for an independent
analysis after Fitch IBCA, a Wall Street ratings agency, downgraded
to junk status about $1 billion of the $1.8 billion in bonds sold to
finance the San Joaquin Hills tollway.</TE>
<TE>   Board members also are concerned about a chronic failure of the
highway to meet revenue and traffic projections since it opened in
1996. Tollway figures show the gap between projected and actual
performance is widening.</TE>
<TE>   Though they acknowledged that the road's financial problems are
serious, board members said the situation is not critical. They noted
that traffic continues to grow on the tollway and the corridor agency
has the resources to cover its interest payments until 2007.</TE>
<TE>   "This should not be construed to mean there's a crisis," said
board member William S. Craycraft, who is the mayor of Mission Viejo.
"I applaud and support the review. Maybe it should have been done
sooner."</TE>
<TE>   Toll road officials said the turnpike has $140 million in cash
reserves, the ability to raise tolls and a $12-million federal line
of credit that has not been tapped. They noted that two other Wall
Street ratings agencies have not lowered their assessments of the
tollway's bonds to junk status.</TE>

<HD>Pauline Trigere, 93; Fashion Designer Bridged Cultures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pauline Trigere, the French-born fashion design legend who
personified American style, died Wednesday of natural causes at her
Manhattan apartment. She was 93, but regularly defied her age.</LD>
<LD>   Just five months ago, Trigere (pronounced Tree-zhair) demonstrated
her awe-inspiring cutting technique to design students at the Fashion
Institute of Technology in New York, recalled Jimmy Newcomer, an
associate professor of fashion design.</LD>
<LD>   Before an auditorium full of students, she showed how easily she
could cut a coat pattern.</LD>
<TE>   "She would put a student on stage and drape her with a piece of
double-face wool that probably cost $150 a yard," Newcomer said.</TE>
<TE>   "She would start cutting into it while she was talking, and with a
couple of strokes and pins, she would create the shape of a coat," he
said. "The kids, who spent hours and hours fussing to try to make a
piece of muslin into a pattern, were amazed."</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration wasn't just for show: That's how Trigere worked
at her business, which for years was at New York fashion's status
address, 550 7th Ave., in the heart of the garment district.</TE>
<TE>   Word of Trigere's death swept through the audience at Ralph
Lauren's early morning fashion show in New York on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the guests was her good friend Stan Herman, president of the
Council of Fashion Designers of America.</TE>
<TE>   Moved to tears, he later described how in 1955 Trigere paid him
for sketches with a mannequin.</TE>
<TE>   Independent, outspoken, hands-on and often impossibly demanding as
a designer, Tri- gere resisted the lucrative lure of licensing, which
perhaps kept her a lesser-known star of American fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Though she introduced the jumpsuit to high fashion, and common
fabrics such as wool and cotton to evening wear, she didn't reach the
status of her contemporaries, Norman Norrell, Vera Maxwell and James
Galanos.</TE>
<TE>   Few, however, could duplicate her sophisticated bias cuts and
unique approach to tailoring.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time she became a star, which was the end of the '40s and
into the '70s, she brought a French couture method to fashion, but
she gave it an American twist," said Newcomer, who started his
fashion career as her assistant in the 1960s. "She translated that
French, hard-edge tailoring into a softer, American way of dressing.
She was doing couture methods in ready-to-wear.</TE>
<TE>   "Her customer was really her," he said. "She never tried to dress
a woman she didn't understand, and she didn't follow trends."</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, after she hired the first black model on 7th Avenue,
Beverly Valdes, Trigere held firm against racist threats.</TE>
<TE>   "There was one major [store] customer in Memphis who threatened
not to buy any Tri- gere clothes," said the designer's son, Jean
Pierre, 69, a Manhattan computer consultant who was the company's
president.</TE>
<TE>   But the store came back, realizing Trigere was good for business.</TE>
<TE>   The designer rarely followed convention. For 47 years, the
divorced Trigere maintained the interest of her Latin lover, Julio
Werthein, a UNESCO ambassador at large, though he lived in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   With her sensual, earthy and daring sense of humor and style, she
was able to part the waters of any room she entered, Newcomer
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   She never let her chronological age dictate her actions.</TE>
<TE>   For her 90th birthday party in 1998, New York fashion publicist
Jody Donohue recalled, Trigere wore a revealing gown and had nine men
seated at her table. "This old lady was sexy, even as an old lady,"
Donohue said. "She was remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   In her thick Gallic accent that Donohue said became "thicker and
sexier as she got older," Trigere could cast off witty and
heart-stopping comments over her hard-liquor cocktails or her morning
coffee. Donohue recalled that she once quipped at a fashion industry
breakfast, "I feel like the toast of the breakfast table."</TE>
<TE>   Her favorite saying, however, paid homage to her signature shade:
"When you're feeling blue, think red."</TE>
<TE>   She used the vibrant color extensively in every kind of creation,
including the elegant accessories for senior citizens she created in
2000 and sold though the mail-order catalog Gold Violin. "Just
because we are getting older," she said on the company's Web site,
"doesn't mean we have to look it."</TE>
<TE>   During their 60-year friendship, New York fashion publicist
Eleanor Lambert observed that Trigere "never gave into old age." The
two often squabbled over the relative merits of American and French
designers. "She would infuriate me," Lambert said. "But she had a
wonderful sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   A self-made success, Trigere was born into the tailoring business.
She learned the basics at the Paris tailoring shop founded by her
Russian emigre parents, Alexandre, a tailor, and Cecile, a
dressmaker. Though she dreamed of a career as a surgeon, Trigere
famously said her father forbade it: "He said he didn't want me
playing with cadavers."</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, with the looming Nazi threat in Germany, Trigere,
together with her mother, brother and two sons, moved to New York,
where she soon found work with designer Hattie Carnegie. Separated
from her husband, Russian tailor Lazar Radley, Trigere started her
own fashion business in 1942 to support her two young sons. Until it
closed in 1993, Trigere Inc. was one of the oldest and among the most
respected fashion companies on 7th Avenue. Fashion experts compare
her work to that of French legends Madeleine Vionnet and Cristobal
Balenciaga, but she often shared customers with Oscar de la Renta,
Bill Blass and Galanos.</TE>
<TE>   She dressed an international contingent of stylish women,
including the duchess of Windsor, Kitty Carlisle Hart, Lena Horne,
Angela Lansbury and Bette Davis. By 1973, she launched a fragrance,
Liquid Chic. In the mid-'80s, her company reached annual sales of $6
million.</TE>
<TE>   The recipient of numerous fashion awards, Trigere's unprecedented
50th anniversary in business was celebrated in 1992 at the Fashion
Institute of Technology. A year later, she was granted the Lifetime
Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
Last year, she received the French Legion of Honor and humorously
thanked a long list of doctors who kept her healthy.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her sons, Jean Pierre, and Philippe Radley, 66,
a Manhattan attorney; granddaughter Karen Radley; and niece Pauline
Jane Trigere. Services will be held today in New York at Riverside
Memorial Chapel.</TE>

<HD>Vernon Walters, 85; Ambassador to U.N., CIA Official</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vernon Walters, a retired Army lieutenant general, intelligence
officer and diplomat who was a deputy director of the CIA and
ambassador to the United Nations, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Walters died Sunday at Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm
Beach, Fla. The cause of death was not reported.</LD>
<LD>   Walters spent his career in the shadowy world of political and
strategic secrets. He was variously described as the quintessential
quiet American and as the U.S. version of James Bond, an idea he
dismissed as absurd. He believed the United States must be able to
project its military power in credible ways, but he also believed
that the purpose of diplomacy is making friends. He told an
interviewer that people who doubted that serious diplomatic business
was conducted at cocktail parties had never been to one.</LD>
<TE>   A linguist, he spoke French, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch,
Portuguese and Russian. He translated for President Dwight Eisenhower
and French President Charles de Gaulle as the two sat in their
bathrobes in front of a fire at Rambouillet Palace outside Paris and
for Vice President Richard Nixon when his limousine was attacked by a
mob in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Walters had successive assignments as U.S. military
attache to Italy, Brazil and France. He also served in Vietnam and
regarded the U.S. effort there a "battlefield of freedom" and "one of
our noblest fights."</TE>
<TE>   He was deputy director of the CIA from 1972 to 1976. For a period
in 1973, he was acting director of the agency. During that time, he
successfully resisted efforts by John Dean, the White House counsel,
to involve the CIA in efforts to cover up the Watergate scandal,
which led to Nixon's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   From 1981 to 1985, Walters was ambassador at large in the Reagan
administration, a job in which he visited more than 100 countries. He
was ambassador to the United Nations from 1985 to 1988 and then
ambassador to Germany until 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Walters was born in New York. His family moved to Europe when he
was 6, and he grew up in Paris. He attended Stonyhurst College, a
secondary school in England, but left at age 16 to work for his
father. He never attended college.</TE>
<TE>   His military career began when he was drafted into the Army in
1941. He was soon commissioned. During World War II, he served in
North Africa and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate postwar years, he was an aide to Gen. Mark Clark,
the U.S. commander in Austria. At Clark's recommendation, George
Marshall, the Army chief of staff, moved him onto his personal staff.
This led to his going to the White House under President Harry Truman
and, later, under Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   Walters had an uncanny ability to be present at large events. As
an aide to Truman, he was the note taker when the president fired
Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War. He was in Tehran in 1953
when the CIA staged a coup in support of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
and in Brazil when a group of generals staged a coup in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   He also was involved in secret negotiations between the United
States and North Vietnam. He once had the task of smuggling Henry
Kissinger, then Nixon's national security advisor, into Paris. He did
it by borrowing the plane of French President George Pompidou, an old
friend.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, when the Palestine Liberation Organization killed two
U.S. diplomats in Sudan, Walters was ordered to make it clear to the
PLO that the United States would not stand for such behavior. A
meeting with PLO representatives was arranged at the palace of King
Hassan of Morocco. Walters had known the king since World War II,
when he gave him a ride in a U.S. tank.</TE>
<TE>   Walters wrote two books, ''The Mighty and the Meek,'' a series of
profiles of famous people with whom he worked, and ''Silent
Missions,'' an autobiography. In private, he was known as a gifted
storyteller and mimic.</TE>
<TE>   Since retiring from the government he had lived in Palm Beach.</TE>
<TE>   He never married.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles man pleaded not guilty Thursday to fatally shooting a
video store customer who was gunned down late last year in the
aftermath of a robbery, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Dent, 28, of Los Angeles was charged in the death of
Joseph Ray Paul, a 31-year-old who was shot in the head as he walked
in front of a South Los Angeles video store.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Dent was arrested Feb. 8. Another suspect in the video
store robbery, Malcolm Rogers, was already in custody on other
charges, they said.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Dent and Rogers robbed a Blockbuster Video store
in the 5400 block of South Western Avenue about 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Paul was walking through the parking lot on his way to return a
movie when Dent ran out of the store and fired one round, striking
him in the back of the head. Police said there was no confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Paul was taken to King-Drew Medical Center and was listed in
critical condition before dying several days later.</TE>
<TE>   Paul's mother, Marie Bunzy, held back tears as she listened to the
details of her son's death during a news conference to announce
Dent's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "When I found out he was killed, it was like all the air escaped
from my body," Bunzy said. "I feel better now that [Dent's] arrested,
but I'll feel better when he's sentenced for life."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks talked about why Paul's death hit
particularly close to home. Paul was a brother of LAPD Chaplain
Ferroll Robins.</TE>
<TE>   "Her brother died in this parking lot," Parks said. "When I went
to the funeral, I promised that this case would get its proper
attention."</TE>
<TE>   For nine years, Robins, a minister at Greater Bethany Community
Church, has helped families in times of loss and grief.</TE>
<TE>   "You care about any person that's in trouble, but it's just
totally different when it's you on that side," Robins said. "I'm very
grateful that a lot of the families I've worked with have also been
our support network during this."</TE>
<TE>   Quietly, Parks and Robins held hands as other officers took
questions from the media.</TE>
<TE>   Paul, a resident of Gardena, had recently passed the writing
examination to be a Beverly Hills police officer, relatives said.
Paul was the father of two children, ages 3 and 5. His children,
especially the younger one, are having trouble understanding that
their father is gone forever, Bunzy said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just told her he was in heaven," Bunzy said. "She keeps asking
me when he's coming back and if we can go pick him up."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Dent also is a suspect in the slaying of Ricardo
Fraizer, 41, in a fight Jan. 10 in the 1500 block of West 50th
Street.</TE>

<HD>Identity Thief Receives 7 Years</HD>
<DH>Fraud: The Ventura resident admitted victimizing hundreds
of people across the country. He is denied probation.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura man who admitted stealing the identities of nearly 1,000
people across the nation was sentenced Thursday to seven years in
state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Bruce Clark rejected a plea to
grant 30-year-old Trever Ziese probation, citing the defendant's
earlier record of drug offenses and the broad scope of his current
crimes.</LD>
<LD>   According to prosecutors, Ziese and Donna Mendoza, a 35-year-old
Oxnard resident, ran a sophisticated identify fraud ring that stole
credit card and bank account numbers from hundreds of people,
including a federal judge.</LD>
<TE>   Working from a Camarillo motel room, the pair obtained information
using stolen mail and hotel registration cards, then produced fake
identification cards and checks using a computer, a scanner and a
credit card skimmer that reads a card's magnetic strip, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ziese and Mendoza were arrested in July after fleeing Ventura
County sheriff's deputies who attempted to make a traffic stop in
Camarillo. Ziese ran into an orchard and was caught by police dogs,
Deputy Dist. Atty Howard Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza, who also ran away, was arrested after she barricaded
herself in the motel room, where detectives found evidence of the
fraud operation, Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the forged checks were counterfeited using a background
emblazoned with a swastika and a Nazi slogan, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Ziese pleaded guilty to eight counts of felony
identity fraud and one count each of felony forgery, possession of a
counterfeit check, falsification of a drivers license and using a
fake check.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza was sentenced in October to a year in jail and placed on
three years' probation after pleading guilty to multiple fraud
counts. She was also barred from carrying blank checks or opening a
checking account during her probation, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The duo had previously operated out of Santa Barbara, said Wise,
one of two prosecutors assigned to the district attorney's Computer
Crimes Unit.</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's sentencing hearing, Wise asked the judge to send
a message with Ziese's case that identity theft will not be treated
lightly.</TE>
<TE>   "This case illustrates pretty vividly the problem of identity
fraud," Wise said. "I think the word needs to go forth that this is a
serious crime."</TE>
<TE>   The defense asked Clark for leniency, arguing that Ziese was an
addict who became involved in the scheme to support a $40-a-day drug
habit.</TE>
<TE>   But Clark denied probation, noting that Ziese had previously
served time in prison and had not performed well on parole.</TE>

<HD>County's Sewage Waiver Targeted</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Assemblyman Ken Maddox introduces bill to end
the sanitation district's ability to release partially treated waste
in the ocean.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County assemblyman introduced a bill Thursday that would
end a local agency's ability to dump dirtier sewage into the ocean
than is allowed almost anywhere else in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Sanitation District has a five-year waiver
allowing it to release the moderately treated sewage. The district
must decide by the end of the year whether it will apply to renew
that waiver, which expires next year. The bill seeks to stop that
renewal.</LD>
<LD>   "For too long, Orange County Sanitation District has had its head
in the sand, and they've been putting our head in the toilet," said
Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove). "Our water-quality standards
were set at about the same time men were wearing leisure suits."</LD>
<TE>   As currently worded, the bill also would put an end to similar
waivers in San Diego, Goleta and Morro Bay. However, Maddox said that
wording could change, depending on what legislators from those areas
want.</TE>
<TE>   The Clean Water Act requires two levels of treatment to kill most
bacteria and viruses before sewage is discharged into oceans, rivers
and lakes. Since 1977, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
been allowed to grant waivers to this requirement if doing so would
not harm the environment or public health. In California, state water
regulators must also sign off on the five-year waiver. Maddox's bill
would forbid the state from approving a waiver unless the sewage
undergoes a higher level of treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District is one of 36 agencies
nationwide that have waivers. In Orange County, only half the sewage
receives two levels of treatment. The district, which serves more
than 2 million people in central and northern Orange County, is the
largest waiver-holder in the nation, discharging 243 million gallons
of moderately treated sewage into the ocean daily--enough to fill the
Rose Bowl three times.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district has said treating the sewage to a higher
level would require a $400-million plant to be built, while creating
no benefit because the district releases the sewage 41/2 miles
offshore and 200 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Blake Anderson, general manager of the Orange County Sanitation
District, said he was distressed that Maddox had submitted the bill
after consulting with environmentalists who oppose the waiver, but
not with the district.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be a common behavior around all this--people are
quite willing to talk about us, but very few people are willing to
talk to us," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to thank Mr. Maddox for a $400-million Valentine's
Day present," he said. "If this is a state matter, then I suppose the
state will pay Orange County the cost to do the upgrade."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists who began a grass-roots effort to end the waiver
more than a year ago were thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if someone shined a light on this nasty little secret
that Orange County has had for so long," said Doug Korthof, a member
of the Ocean Outfall Group, whose city-by-city campaign has persuaded
city councils in Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and
Costa Mesa to oppose the waiver. Fullerton is expected to pass a
similar resolution next week.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox said he became interested in this issue last summer when he
took his then 11/2-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to
Huntington City Beach, and started thinking about ocean pollution.
After doing a little research, he learned of the district's waiver.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't let my dog drink out of the toilet. Why would I want
my kids playing out in the ocean?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm anticipating broad support on this [bill]. It's
unconscionable that this amount of sewage is being dumped into the
ocean. Most people are shocked to find out this shadow government
called Orange County Sanitation District is engaged in this kind of
practice."</TE>

<HD>IOC Just a Spectator in Skating Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>What does a Latvian bobsledder have to do with figure-skating
judging?</LD>
<LD>   The answer: At the Olympic Games, the sports are run by
international federations, not the International Olympic Committee,
though it's a common misperception that the IOC has direct
responsibility for everything having to do with anything "Olympic."</LD>
<LD>   Just days before the Salt Lake City Winter Games began, an
international arbitration panel, in the most dramatic way possible,
reminded the IOC of the key role of the sports federations. The panel
reinstated the eligibility of Latvian bobsledder Sandis Prusis for
the Games, backing the bobsled federation, though the IOC tried to
ban him following a positive test for the steroid nandrolone.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, in the controversy that has erupted over whether the
judging was fair in pairs figure skating Monday night, the IOC can do
little more than ratchet up the pressure on the International Skating
Union, perhaps the most powerful of the winter sports federations, by
urging it to conduct an expedient inquiry. IOC President Jacques
Rogge emphasized in a letter sent Wednesday to the ISU the "high
urgency" of the matter and the "need to take adequate action as
quickly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating the politics, as well as the intrigue, ISU
President Ottavio Cinquanta is also a member of the IOC's
policymaking Executive Board. Cinquanta has said the ISU is sticking
to its original schedule--to review the judging Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "When something like this happens, it's bad for the Olympics
because people think it's the Olympics that's not fair," said
Canadian Dick Pound, a former IOC vice president. "When in fact
that's not the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition is run and judged by the ISU, and it's the ISU
that has the problem."</TE>
<TE>   News reports quoting an unidentified IOC official said the IOC is
"leaning" toward awarding a duplicate gold medal to Canadian pairs
figure skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier. Russians Anton
Sikharulidze and Yelena Berezhnaya were awarded the gold. Five of
nine judges voted for the Russians, including French judge Marie
Reine Le Gougne, who sources say later told other judges she was
pressured to vote that way.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reports said the IOC is trying to take control of the
dispute from the ISU. It quoted Paul Henderson, another Canadian IOC
member, saying the matter might become one for the IOC if it is
proved a judge violated the Olympic oath to be impartial.</TE>
<TE>   R. Kevan Gosper of Australia, a senior IOC vice president, said
late Thursday that the IOC has "certainly not discussed options like"
awarding a second gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is fraught with uncertainty for the IOC, because a
second gold medal for the Canadian pair would set a precedent that
undoubtedly would invite others who have felt aggrieved by the
so-called "technical" decisions of federation judges, or federation
appeals panels, to renew their requests for redress directly to the
IOC.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the IOC's Executive Board has long shied away from a
review of the controversial 1972 gold-medal basketball game between
the United States and the Soviet Union. The Americans thought they
won until time was put back on the clock and the Soviets scored what
was ruled the game-winning points. An international basketball
federation panel ruled that the Soviets won, and the IOC--despite
repeated requests--has never interfered.</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of a dual gold for the Canadians, Gosper said, "That
has not been a deliberation of ours because it's not a matter for us.
The matter for us is that we find out the result of the ISU inquiry,"
and "the earlier the better."</TE>
<TE>   As for Henderson's remarks, Gosper said, "He can say what he
likes. But he doesn't have the authority to suggest we have been
deliberating about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee hasn't taken a position,
either. And it won't.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got my own troubles," said Mitt Romney, its president,
"enough for me not to worry about other people's."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The call came early one Saturday morning.</LD>
<LD>   It was a social worker, asking my wife and me if we were still
interested in adopting. A baby boy, she said, might be available.</LD>
<LD>   "When?" we asked.</LD>
<TE>   "Monday," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean next Monday?" we asked.</TE>
<TE>   We were more than willing. We had been waiting too long not to
leap at the opportunity. But, of course, there were many obstacles to
overcome within such a short time, one of which was that I was
supposed to travel Sunday to Japan for the 1998 Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   My wife and I discussed whether I should cancel, or at least
postpone, the trip. We decided that I should go as scheduled. The
Olympics are important to this newspaper, and it was probably too
late to acquire a replacement credential for another reporter. The
Olympics also have been an important part of my career since I
covered my first one in Montreal in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   I also have long believed that the Olympics are important to our
civilization, that they are not merely a sporting event but a
celebration of our young people and their ability to come together
every other year in peace. I never have been so naive as to think
they were uncorrupted--above politics and greed--but I was certain
that they were more good than bad and that the world was a better
place because of them.</TE>
<TE>   I spent the rest of the day Saturday filling out legal documents
and boarded the plane as planned Sunday, although because of delays I
didn't arrive in Tokyo until much later than planned. Upon arriving,
I immediately called my wife to learn that I was a father. She had
David in her arms, and when she put the phone to his mouth, I could
hear him gently breathing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I wondered then and many times since about my decision. The most
recent time was Wednesday, when it was reported that a French figure
skating judge might have succumbed to pressure when she gave higher
marks in the pairs freestyle program to the Russians than the
Canadians. If so, she violated the oath of fairness she took at the
opening ceremony and conspired in a scandal that tarnishes the
Russians' gold medal, the sport of figure skating and the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Do I sound disillusioned? I am. The only question I have for
myself is what took so long.</TE>
<TE>   There is evidence of corruption dating back to the ancient Games
in Greece that began in 776 BC. My first experience with it occurred
in the summer of 1976, when a Soviet modern pentathlete named Borys
Onyshchenko (later dubbed "Disonyshchenko" by the media) used a wired
epee that registered hits when there were none and East German
swimmers were, as we discovered after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
doped to the gills.</TE>
<TE>   Steroids were not strictly an Eastern Bloc vice. In 1984 in Los
Angeles, an Olympics boycotted by the Soviet Union and most of its
allies, a number of drug positives never came to light because, it
was revealed years later, a maid had inadvertently removed the
documentation from a room in the Biltmore Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who believed attaching the word "Olympian" to an athlete
implied virtue had to reconsider when Tonya Harding failed to confess
that she knew associates of hers, including her husband, had planned
an attack on Nancy Kerrigan in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   As proved by the corruption scandal leading to Salt Lake City's
selection as host for these Games, the International Olympic
Committee has been no better a caretaker of the movement's ideals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I guess it is the ideals that will keep me coming back to the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Often they are not reached. Too often they are not even reached
for.</TE>
<TE>   But when they are, it is truly a special thing.</TE>
<TE>   I remember in particular when Elana Mayer, a white South African,
and Derartu Tulu, a black Ethiopian, joined hands and circled the
track for a victory lap after the women's 10,000 meters in Barcelona
in 1992, the first year South Africa was allowed to rejoin the
Olympic movement after decades of banishment because of its apartheid
policies.</TE>
<TE>   I remember Kerri Strug vaulting with a badly sprained ankle in
1996 because her team needed her and Hermann Maier charging down the
hill to win the super-G three days after a horrific crash in the
downhill in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   I learned something about being a father in 1992. A British
quarter-miler, Derek Redmond, fell because of a torn hamstring on the
final curve and began walking toward the finish line, committed to
crossing it. His father, Jim, who was watching from the stands in
Montjuic Stadium, ignored security, leaped over the railing and,
lending a shoulder, helped his son get there. If David ever needs a
shoulder, I hope I am there for him.</TE>
<TE>   Among the lessons we can learn from the Olympics is about human
frailties. We haven't advanced all that far in pursuit of a more
perfect civilization through the Olympics. We probably never will.
But the important thing is that we have the vehicle that enables us
to keep trying.</TE>
<TE>   "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that
year by year recedes before us," F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote. "It
eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster,
stretch out our arms farther ... and one fine morning--</TE>
<TE>   "So we beat on, boats against the current...."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PROVO, Utah</DL>
<LD>It's getting difficult to keep up with the U.S. women's hockey team.
Sometimes they score before the public-address announcer has a chance
to finish giving the details of the previous goal.</LD>
<LD>   At times the crowd tried counting up the goal tally in the first
two games, sometimes running off more numbers than an episode of
"Sesame Street," but ditched that Thursday after No. 10.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. defeated China, 12-1, in a preliminary-round game at the
Peaks Ice Arena, giving the Americans 22 goals on 128 shots
(including 71 Thursday).</LD>
<TE>   "It's definitely a contagious feeling," said U.S. forward Katie
King, who scored two goals Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone loves to see the scoreboard light up. We just try to
rush the net and get the puck in the goal. One line scores, then the
next and the next. Every line on this team can score, and that's what
makes us a good team."</TE>
<TE>   Team captain Cammi Granato had a hat trick and Laurie Baker had
two goals as well.</TE>
<TE>   The most unlikely goal came 16 minutes into the second period.
That's when Yang Xiuqing took a couple of strides past center ice,
flipped the puck at the American net and saw it trickle between U.S.
goalie Sarah Tueting's skates.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a fluke thing," Tueting said. "I was looking down at
my pads and suddenly I heard her scream. It was like a bouncing ball,
not a puck."</TE>
<TE>   Even Yang had to admit: "It was kind of a lucky goal."</TE>
<TE>   It's the only goal scored against the U.S. so far in the
tournament. China has scored before against the U.S., so it didn't
exactly mark a major breakthrough for a country that has only 100
women's hockey players.</TE>
<TE>   But it did serve as a reminder to the Americans that they aren't
so invincible that they can afford lapses in concentration.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to keep telling yourself: 'Watch the puck'" Tueting
said. "Before the game I was looking for my parents in the stands. I
haven't looked for my parents since I was 7 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "That was exactly the problem. When you're focused, you don't even
see the crowds, the flags, anything. There could be purple people up
there and it wouldn't make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Ben Smith has said that Tueting and Sara DeCosta will
alternate starts in goal during the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The rotation plays out that DeCosta would get the start for the
U.S. in the gold medal game. Tueting's only chance to get that start
would be to put on an overwhelming goaltending display.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't get many opportunities to redeem herself Thursday, as
the Chinese managed only 10 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Teams have trouble getting the puck past the Americans and into
the offensive zone.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. had its own troubles in the first period, when players
tried to do everything themselves. After Smith encouraged them to
stay true to the team's nature and pass more, the offense opened up
with five goals in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Two goals came in a span of 35 seconds. In the third period, the
U.S. scored twice in 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   That was more offense than the Chinese showed all day. They went
an entire five-minute power play without recording a shot on goal.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty came when Tricia Dunn checked a Chinese player against
the glass from behind at the end of the first period. Dunn received a
game misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plays Finland next. Finland, which defeated Germany, 3-1,
Thursday, has finished third in six of the seven women's World
Championships, and this is expected to be the American's toughest
test in the preliminary round.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't play the Finns in their pre-Olympic tour because a
November trip for a tournament in Finland was scrapped in the wake of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of common opponents, Finland only beat China by four
goals. But at least it didn't allow China to score.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Katja Riipi scored Finland's first goal and assisted on the other
two to key a 3-1 victory over Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Tuula Puputti stopped 15 shots for Finland (2-0). Stephanie
Wartosch-Kurten made 36 saves and Julia Wierscher scored Germany's
first goal of the Olympics with 6:05 left.</TE>
<TE>   Finland, which has already beaten China, essentially clinched a
berth in the medal round. Germany (0-2) is all-but eliminated from
medal contention.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Gang of Nine received their top-secret instructions long ago.</LD>
<LD>   Assignment: Judge the ice dance competition at the 2002 Winter
Olympics, Salt Lake City, United States of America.</LD>
<LD>   Level of difficulty: Piece of cake.</LD>
<TE>   Required equipment: The ice dance results from the 1998 Winter
Olympics and the 2001 World Championships; you will need them to
determine the winners at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Paperback novel;
maybe three or four. Magazines and newspapers; you will need them
when the paperback novels run out. Coffee. Jolt! Cola. Caffeine
tablets. Pillow; you will need it when the coffee, cola and caffeine
run out.</TE>
<TE>   But that was before Monday and the ruckus caused by pairs judging
controversy. In other words, the jig  is up.</TE>
<TE>   Now, for the remainder of the figure skating competition, every
figure skating judgment will be scrutinized and second-guessed, along
with every figure skating judge. Even in the greatest foregone
conclusion in international sport, ice dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Ice dancing has been in danger of having its Olympic credential
pulled since the judging controversy of 1998, the event ending in a
1-2-3 finish that appeared to have been determined weeks in advance.
After the Canadian pair of Shae-Lynn Bourne and Viktor Kraatz seemed
to be outrageously underscored at fourth place, the judge from
Canada, Jean Senft, went public with accusations of vote trading
among the judging panel.</TE>
<TE>   After being reprimanded for national bias by the International
Skating Union, Senft took her case to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport, producing tape-recorded phone conversations with Ukrainian
judge Yuri Balkov that indicated collusion among at least three ice
dance judges. The CAS overturned the ISU's ruling, but the ISU
responded by suspending both Senft and Balkov.</TE>
<TE>   Even more damning was a famous photograph, taken by an Italian
photographer, showing an ice dance judge nodding off during the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   That figures to change today, as ice dance compulsories get
underway. It's a new world now, and that world is watching. No more
snoozing. No more doodling.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the ice dance judges will even have to figure out the
voting procedure--and wait until after the dancers actually step onto
the ice before pushing buttons.</TE>

<LD>There is precedent for awarding a second gold medal in an Olympic

now.</LD>

Barcelona, the International Olympic Committee awarded a gold medal
to Sylvie Frechette, a Canadian synchronized swimmer who they
determined was the victim of a judging error.</LD>

allowed to correct an 8.7 score--intended to be a 9.7--after she
entered it into her computer. The intended score would have given
Frechette the gold.</LD>

<DH>French Figure Skating Judge Caught in the Middle of an Ice
Storm</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY HARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Reacting to the controversy over the ice dancing judging during the
1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, one judge told L'Equipe, a
French sports publication, "In the last 10 years, there has been an
incredible evolution [in judging figure skating].</LD>
<LD>   "Of course, there are still mistakes. But there is no flagrant
injustice. Everyone on the [medals] podium deserves it."</LD>
<LD>   The judge was Marie Reine Le Gougne.</LD>
<TE>   Four years later, she is at the center of a controversy because of
her role in a decision during the Winter Olympic pairs competition
that many consider a flagrant injustice. It also is leading to
questions about whether judging has evolved enough. Or at all.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne, a veteran judge who is president of the Strasbourg
Sports Club in eastern France, allegedly told fellow judges
immediately after the pairs freestyle program that she had been
pressured by the French figure skating federation to side with
Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze. They won a
controversial 5-4 decision over Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier, creating a public furor.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne's alleged comments also prompted an investigation by the
International Skating Union, which governs figure skating and
speedskating. Although Le Gougne has been unavailable to the media, a
source close to the investigation said she has denied making the
comments. The source said she also denied receiving pressure from the
French federation.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne has been an outspoken defender of figure skating
judging.</TE>
<TE>   "I am fed up," she told L'Equipe in 1998 after a French television
network broadcast a documentary charging corruption by judges. "It's
easy to throw stones at us. Yes, I am very angry because some people
[criticize] us despite not knowing a thing. They are concentrating on
the bad apples when 99.9% of judges are trying to do their work
honestly."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, she said she can often predict the outcome of a competition
before it begins merely by looking at the composition of the judging
panel.</TE>
<TE>   She also has acknowledged favoring French skaters.</TE>
<TE>   "The system being what it is, yes, I am trying to give the French
skating a good image," she said in the L'Equipe interview.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, she said she would not give higher marks to a
French skater if a competitor from another country clearly skated
better. In 1998, she was on the judging panel for men's singles and
gave the highest marks to Russian Ilia Kulik, who won the gold medal.
She gave second-place marks to Frenchman Philippe Candeloro, who
finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Another veteran figure skating judge, who did not want to be
identified, said he has been on numerous panels with Le Gougne and
considers her a better-than-average judge.</TE>
<TE>   But he also said she is considered "high maintenance" because she
is "extremely emotional."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Associated Press, Didier Gailhaguet, president of
the French Ice Sports Federation, denied Wednesday that the
federation pressured Le Gougne but said she had been "somewhat
manipulated" by people close to her. He was quoted as calling her a
"fragile person."</TE>
<TE>   Gailhaguet released a statement Thursday saying that his comments
were "completely misinterpreted."</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne, believed to be in her late 30s or early 40s, has
complained in the past about sexism in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote an article last year for a Web periodical, L'Humanite,
describing her judging experience as "10 years of hell."</TE>
<TE>   "To succeed, you have to prove yourself 20 times more than a man.
I know a lot of young girls who stopped because they didn't have the
strength to continue to fight."</TE>

<HD>French Chief: No Collusion</HD>
<DH>Head of Ice Sports Federation says embattled judge Le
Gougne felt extreme pressure but did not trade votes with 'any other
country.'</DH>

<AU>PHILIP HERSH</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Denying collusion between French officials and "any other country" to
trade votes in pairs skating for votes in another figure skating
event, the head of the French Ice Sports Federation said Thursday
that the pressure felt by judge Marie Reine Le Gougne was nothing
unusual in the "figure skating game."</LD>
<LD>   Le Gougne has been the center of a firestorm since Monday, when
sources say she told other skating officials she felt "extreme
pressure" to vote a certain way while judging the Olympic pairs
event. She was among five judges who voted for Russians Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who were awarded the gold medal
over Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier in a controversial
decision.</LD>
<LD>   "In skating, everyone talks with everyone," Didier Gailhaguet,
president of the French Ice Sports Federation, said. "Judges,
officials, they go to practices and predict who is going to win. One
person will say, 'Doesn't that skater do a good jump?' and another
will say, 'Don't you think that skater looks good?' This isn't done
to influence the results but to persuade that something is the best.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course, all this is more difficult to handle in the special
atmosphere of the Olympics. More people are talking to the judges.
Marie Reine felt very strong emotional stress that had lasted for
several months. Perhaps she overreacted a little."</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne made her comments about pressure Monday night to fellow
judges, according to a highly placed Times source and several other
news reports. She made them again during the event review meeting
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Gailhaguet has several roles at this Olympics. He also is team
leader of the entire French team and a member of the International
Skating Union council that will discuss the pairs situation at a
meeting Monday. The Canadian Olympic Assn. is trying to have a second
gold medal awarded to Sale and Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge asked the
ISU on Wednesday "to take adequate action as quickly as possible."
That request was repeated Thursday by U.S. Figure Skating Assn.
President Phyllis Howard.</TE>
<TE>   ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta said Thursday the organization
would not advance the date of the planned hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Some fear results in the two remaining Olympic figure skating
events, dance and women's singles, could be compromised because
judges will feel pressured to come down hard on French or Russian
skaters and be lenient to Canadians because of the uproar the pairs
decision has caused in North America. It has been called the biggest
scandal in the history of figure skating, a sport long buffeted by
allegations of backroom deals.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel it is a scandal to call this a scandal," Gailhaguet said.
"I sincerely hope this exaggerated polemic doesn't affect the events
that will follow. The athletes should not have their achievements
diminished by all this."</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne, who was not scheduled to judge any other event, had
switched hotels because of media pressure, Gailhaguet said.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne admitted to being intimidated by the reaction of the
sellout crowd at the Salt Lake Ice Center, which booed lustily when
the scores were announced. The public and media outcry over the
decision further unnerved her, Gailhaguet said.</TE>
<TE>   "The atmosphere here is very particular," Gailhaguet said. "To
have 15,000 people around you, mainly people from North America, the
judges are not used to this, especially the European judges,"
Gailhaguet said.</TE>
<TE>   "Marie Reine told me she was leaving with her head up. A judge is
like a skater. They can make a mistake."</TE>

<HD>This Pair of Golds Is Not Pairs Gold</HD>
<DH>Canada's LeMay Doan repeats her 500-meter victory from
Nagano. Witty improves and finishes 14th.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>It was speedskating, not figure skating, so the gold medal Catriona
LeMay Doan won for Canada in the women's 500 meters Thursday at the
Utah Olympic oval was not up for debate.</LD>
<LD>   "Catriona is the boss of the 500," German runner-up Monique
Garbrecht-Enfeldt said.</LD>
<LD>   Champion too, for the second time in two Olympics. Pouncing from
the start, the woman known as "the Cat" around hometown Saskatoon
skated a slower time than she had in Wednesday's first heat and still
made the most of it, beating Garbrecht-Enfeldt by 0.15 of a second in
the final run of the day.</LD>
<TE>   "I wasn't really thinking about the time," LeMay Doan said. "I
knew with about 50 meters to go it was enough. It wasn't good, but it
was enough."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it wasn't all that bad, but LeMay Doan is the
world-record holder in the event, so she has high standards.</TE>
<TE>   In winning her third Olympic medal--besides gold in the 500 at
Nagano, she won a bronze in the 1,000--she skated her race in 37.45
seconds, which combined with her Olympic-record 37.30 Wednesday gave
her a total time of 74.75.</TE>
<TE>   Garbrecht-Enfeldt, who made a move on the Canadian about halfway
through the race, couldn't come up with a finishing kick and wound up
with times of 37.60 and 74.94. She now has a pair of widely separated
medals for her trophy case. She was third 10 years ago in the 1,000
at Albertville, France.</TE>
<TE>   Her German teammate, Sabine Voelker, was third.</TE>
<TE>   Happy as she was to win representing Canada, LeMay Doan said the
continuing controversy surrounding Canadian pairs figure skaters
Jamie Sale and David Pelletier had no bearing on her performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the pressure, but not about that," she said. "You imagine
[winning] sometimes too much and you get ahead of yourself. I knew I
had to go out and skate a normal, regular race.</TE>
<TE>   "Jamie and David have handled their situation with nothing but
class--we've always been a classy team--and I hope my medal serves as
a source of re-encouragement for Canadian people, but I don't think
one medal ever makes up for another one.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just happy to have won this one. Monique really pushed me."</TE>
<TE>   American skaters were out of the running before Thursday's race
began, the fastest, Chris Witty, starting at a deficit of more than a
second--huge in this race. Witty, in fact, considered taking the day
off to rest up for Sunday's 1,000, her strongest event.</TE>
<TE>   The silver medalist in the 1,000 at Nagano, she has mononucleosis
and has experienced stamina problems.</TE>
<TE>   She opted for more speed work, though, and rewarded herself with a
personal-record-tying time of 38.36, jumping up from 17th at the
halfway point to 14th in the final standings.</TE>
<TE>   "I was quite pleased," she said, "considering I didn't have a lot
of time to do speed work this week.... It's been tough because every
day is a different story. One day I feel tired, the next day I feel
great. I felt pretty good this morning so I thought I'd race today."</TE>
<TE>   Becky Sundstrom was the next-highest American, finishing 20th, and
Elli Ochowicz was 22nd. Amy Sannes fell 100 meters into the race and
did not finish.</TE>

<LD>Despite the presence of halfpipe snowboarders and freestyle skiers,
there aren't enough hot dogs in Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Six days into the Winter Games, spectators had already eaten more
than 400,000 hot dogs--the entire allotment planned for the 17 days
of competition. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has ordered
another shipment, but until they arrive, SLOC has given fans
permission to bring their own food into the following outdoor venues:
Deer Valley Resort, Park City Mountain Resort, Utah Olympic Park,
Soldier Hollow and Snowbasin.</LD>
<LD>   To alleviate delays through security checkpoints, SLOC is asking
spectators to bring food and beverages in clear plastic bags so
security can visually inspect the packages. Thermoses, cans and glass
containers are off-limits.</LD>
<TE>   He Didn't Make Cut</TE>
<TE>   There's a saying in baseball that sometimes the best trades are
the ones you don't make.</TE>
<TE>   Well, we might end up crediting Bode Miller's skiing success in
these Olympics to a surgery that wasn't performed.</TE>
<TE>   After Miller tore left knee ligaments in a downhill crash at last
year's world championships at St. Anton, Austria, he flew home to
consult with Dr. Richard Steadman, the famed Vail-based orthopedic
surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   Because Miller's anterior cruciate ligament was not completely
ruptured, Steadman opted not to do a reconstruction. Instead,
Steadman removed damaged cartilage and performed a less invasive
procedure that allowed the ACL to heal on its own.</TE>
<TE>   The decision shortened Miller' recovery time by months and
probably allowed him to ski in these Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the best surgery I've never done," Steadman joked after
Miller won the silver medal Wednesday in Alpine combined.</TE>
<TE>   Steadman had another season to smile.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, he repaired the knee of Norway's Kjetil Andre
Aamodt, who beat Miller by 0.28 of a second to win the Alpine gold.</TE>
<TE>   More Bode</TE>
<TE>   Miller's spectacular recovery from potential disaster in
Wednesday's downhill portion of the Alpine combined event has the ski
racing world buzzing.</TE>
<TE>   Austrian superstar Stephan Eberharter, the World Cup overall
leader and bronze medalist in Sunday's Olympic downhill, said
Thursday he would not have been able to rescue himself from that
predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "If it happened to me, I'd rip the ligaments in my knee,"
Eberharter said. "I think his knees must be made of rubber."</TE>
<TE>   Going for Three</TE>
<TE>   Could Miller's silver medal mark a new era in U.S. skiing?</TE>
<TE>   Miller has a good chance to become the first American Alpine skier
to win three medals in the same Olympics. He'll be a medal contender
next week in the giant slalom at Park City and the odds-on favorite
to take the gold in slalom at Deer Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Eight American Alpine skiers have won two Olympic medals: Andrea
Mead Lawrence, Diann Roffe, Tommy Moe, Picabo Street, Phil Mahre,
Penny Pitou, Jean Saubert and Gretchen Fraser.</TE>
<TE>   Fraser (gold and silver in 1948), Mead Lawrence (double gold in
1952), Pitou (two silvers in 1960), Saubert (silver and bronze in
1964) and Moe (gold and silver in 1994) are the only Americans to win
more than one medal in the same Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ski Team President Bill Marolt had predicted 10 Olympic
skiing medals for the U.S., but he was beginning to wonder if his
Alpine program was going to contribute to that total.</TE>
<TE>   Until Miller's silver, the ski program had scored six medals, four
in snowboarding and two in freestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "To hit our 10, we need Alpine," Marolt said.</TE>
<TE>   Just to Clarify</TE>
<TE>   Swiss hockey players Marcel Jenni and Reto Von Arx were suspended
hours before Switzerland was to play Belarus in a qualification-round
game Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss Coach Ralph Krueger said the players were suspended because
they missed curfew.</TE>
<TE>   They were not suspended, Krueger pointed out, for their poor play
in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland defeated Belarus, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Speak Slowly to Her,</TE>
<TE>   She Carries a Big Stick</TE>
<TE>   U.S. women's hockey forward Julie Chu's father was born in Hong
Kong and her grandparents were born in China. Although her Chinese
was good enough to help a teammate purchase some wooden spoons when
the team traveled to China in September, she wasn't quite able to
keep up with and translate the opponents' conversations when the U.S.
played China on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I can speak it with my grandmother," Chu said. "She usually
speaks a little more slowly."</TE>
<TE>   This Is Not Really Salt Lake City Anymore Dept.</TE>
<TE>   A SLOC bus carrying spectators to the ski-jumping venue early
Saturday arrived before security was ready, so passengers were shown
a movie while they waited.</TE>
<TE>   The film, "The Long Riders,'' featured a brothel and female
nudity.</TE>
<TE>   Bobsled Cookies Anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Jill Bakken, veteran U.S. women's bobsledder, was talking about
crude beginnings of the sport here in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were trying to raise money for sleds, they told us to go
to Times Square and sell bumper stickers," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in Translation</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Penna, a cross-country skier from Brazil, was asked
about Wednesday's beginning of Lent.</TE>
<TE>   "Lent? What? You want me to give you something?'' he said.</TE>

<HD>Fratianne Comes Full Circle</HD>
<DH>The silver medalist at the 1980 Winter Games in Lake Placid
has taught the children of the women with whom she once skated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eager to persuade Frank Carroll to take their daughter on as a
student but frustrated when he didn't respond to their pleas for an
audition, Linda Fratianne's parents resorted to desperate measures to
ensure the respected figure skating coach would notice her.</LD>
<LD>   They went to the rink in Van Nuys where Carroll taught and sent
9-year-old Linda onto the ice, where she skated circles around
Carroll, jumping and prancing all the while.</LD>
<LD>   The ploy worked.</LD>
<TE>   "She was cute as a button and had such spring in her legs,"
Carroll recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Fratianne, though, was intimidated. "I remember being terrified,"
the Northridge native said. "I was very shy as a young kid. He was
bigger than life to me."</TE>
<TE>   She recovered from her initial fright when Carroll agreed to coach
her, beginning a relationship in which she would win four U.S.
championships, two world titles and the silver medal at the 1980 Lake
Placid Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the perfect student. Totally cooperative and disciplined,
always," Carroll said. "She was the first one who changed skating for
girls. They all had to do triples after Linda."</TE>
<TE>   Fratianne was the favorite at Lake Placid after winning the 1979
world championship, but her deficit after the compulsory
figures--which were eliminated 10 years later--was too big to
overcome. She finished second to Anett Poetzsch of East Germany and
third at the 1980 world competition before turning professional.</TE>
<TE>   Now 41, Fratianne is a skating coach in Sun Valley, Idaho. She
recently was divorced and said she would like to return to the Los
Angeles area but is reluctant to uproot her 11-year-old daughter,
Ali, a ski racer.</TE>
<TE>   Fratianne has remained close to Carroll over the years, calling
him for advice and referring students to him for lessons. While he
was coaching Timothy Goebel at an out-of-town competition last fall,
Fratianne filled in for him at HealthSouth Training Center in El
Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   It brought back many pleasant memories. "I loved it," she said. "I
was teaching kids and I had skated with their mothers. And it's 75
degrees there, which I loved. I've been in cold places all my life
and I want to be warm. I come home and wear two pairs of long johns,
a headband and a scarf in the house."</TE>

<DH>Asia: Two U.S. men and their brother run afoul of authorities in
their business dealings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Until last week, Solaiman Faizi's biggest problems were making sure
that guests at his newly opened hotel didn't burn the place down with
their small propane stoves or overload the tenuous power supply.</LD>
<LD>   But after an unpleasant encounter with post-Taliban vengeance and
justice, Faizi isn't so sure that he should have left New Jersey to help
reopen his family's hotel in one of the world's most treacherous cities.</LD>
<LD>   One of his brothers is stewing in Kabul's central jail, recovering
from a beating by soldiers. Another brother just got out of the hospital,
where he says he was treated for a concussion and bruises to his face and
kidney inflicted by the same government forces. And their elderly father
is worried that there's worse to come.</LD>
<TE>   This, unfortunately, is what happens when a couple of Jersey car
dealers go mano a mano with a cabal of well-connected Afghan shopkeepers.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan Americans of the Faizi clan are locked in a battle of wills
with the Kabul merchants to determine who, in the timeless Afghan
tradition, can round up the toughest street muscle and summon the
heaviest political connections. It's the Tajik Americans versus the
Tajiks from the Panjshir Valley, a Northern Alliance-dominated area north
of Kabul, the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in America anymore," Faizi said from the family's
second-floor drawing room above the merchants' shuttered shops. "Here,
it's all about the clan who you know and how good your connections are."</TE>
<TE>   The trouble erupted one afternoon last week when Faizi's hot-tempered
older brother, Mustafa, sent an emissary to confront four merchants who
run shops on the ground floor of the family's Mustafa Hotel, which opened
Nov. 19 for the first time since 1979. Mustafa said the merchants owed
four years' back rent, which went uncollected during the Taliban era.</TE>
<TE>   The merchants begged to differ. According to the Faizis, the tenants
attacked the emissary. Enraged, Mustafa grabbed a hockey stick--his
brothers hail from New Jersey Devils country--and smashed the merchants'
windows on the theory that the glass technically belonged to his family.</TE>
<TE>   After Mustafa calmed down, his brothers said, he turned himself in to
the police. The merchants called the Afghan version of 911, according to
the Faizis, by summoning one of the shopkeepers' brothers, who works at
the Interior Ministry--which is dominated by Northern Alliance Tajiks
from the Panjshir Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Soon a squad of Northern Alliance soldiers was roaring up to the hotel
from the ministry two blocks away. The family says soldiers and merchants
forced their way into the hotel and tried to abduct the clan's
72-year-old patriarch, the stout, white-bearded M. T. Faizi. Protecting
him was his youngest son, Wais, 31, a former sales manager for a Nissan
dealership in Bergen County, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them they'd have to kill me first," Wais said later. He issued
his challenge in fluent Dari, followed by what he acknowledges was an
equally fluent torrent of Dari curses and insults. He may be an Afghan
American, but he's Jersey all the way.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'OK, tough guy, we're taking you instead,' " Wais said.</TE>
<TE>   Wais and the soldiers reached the street at the moment Mustafa was
returning from the police station. This being Afghanistan, a brawl
erupted. During the melee, Mustafa allegedly stabbed three people. The
Faizis are pleading self-defense. Anyway, they say, the cuts were mere
flesh wounds.</TE>
<TE>   According to the family, Mustafa was slapped, punched, kicked and
whacked with a rifle butt by the soldiers. Then he was hauled off to the
Interior Ministry, where, the family says, he was smacked around some
more.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next is not in dispute. The soldiers had the misfortune
of conducting their affairs in view of a hotel full of journalists. Among
them was Dan Alexe, a Radio Free Europe correspondent who was on a
balcony with a video camera.</TE>
<TE>   Alexe's videotape shows Wais, covering his head with his arms, being
hit on the crown with a gun barrel. Several soldiers then slap, punch and
kick Wais as they stuff him into a vehicle and drive away.</TE>
<TE>   As Wais is beaten, the video shows, a truckload of peacekeepers from
the International Security Assistance Force rolls slowly past a few feet
from the soldiers. The truck rumbles on with hardly a pause.</TE>
<TE>   At the Interior Ministry, Wais said, a commander slapped him. Then the
official snapped his fingers. Suddenly a dozen or more soldiers were
kicking and punching him. An hour after his release that night, his face
was scarlet and puffy, and two crimson welts had erupted on his swollen
forehead, he said. His kidneys ached.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I just went 10 rounds with Mike Tyson," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With the two brothers in custody, the family says, the soldiers again
confronted the elder Faizi. This time Solaiman, 34, came to his father's
defense. He said he was stabbed in the hand as he and the hotel staff
fended off soldiers and merchants. The soldiers left without the family
patriarch.</TE>
<TE>   Here matters became complicated. Wais and Solaiman grew up in the U.S.
and are naturalized American citizens. Mustafa, 39, grew up in
Afghanistan and is not. While Wais was freed, Mustafa remained a guest of
the Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Solaiman and Wais phoned U.S. relatives who they said have
connections at the State Department and the United Nations and with the
brother of Afghan interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Wais and Solaiman hustled down to the U.S. Embassy
in Kabul. There, security staffers in effect told the brothers: Hey, we
warned Americans not to come to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, an embassy spokesman cited a State Department
advisory that warns Americans to stay out of the country. "If American
citizens choose to do business in a high-risk environment, in what is
still a war zone, then the ability of the U.S. government to assist them
is very limited should they run into problems," said the spokesman, who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   If a similar incident occurred in, say, Paris, the spokesman said, the
embassy would tell an American citizen how to file a complaint with "the
relevant local authorities." Unfortunately for the Faizis, the relevant
local authorities turned out to be, alas, the Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately," the spokesman solemnly agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The Faizis were not deterred. Cashing in on years of connections built
by their father, who they said owns considerable local real estate, they
were granted an audience with the prime minister. Karzai is an ethnic
Pushtun who, at least in theory, would have no part in this fight among
ethnic Tajiks.</TE>
<TE>   According to the brothers, Karzai apologized and promised to fire the
Interior Ministry commander who had led the posse of soldiers. Keeping
his wits during his ordeal, Wais had scrawled the commander's name on his
palm.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers said Karzai sent them to speak with Interior Ministry
officials about securing Mustafa's release. The officials were
conciliatory at first, they said, but the brothers found themselves
escorted back into the very rooms where Wais says he was beaten.</TE>
<TE>   There, they said, commanders upbraided them for taking their
complaints to the embassy and the prime minister. That was precisely the
wrong way to handle these matters, they said they were told.</TE>
<TE>   "The right way," Solaiman said with contempt, "is to keep your mouth
shut and pay somebody off." Solaiman too is a Jersey guy, who says he was
a general manager for a Toyota dealership.</TE>
<TE>   The offending commander was not fired, the brothers said. Mustafa was
not released. Worse, he was transferred to the dank city jail, Solaiman
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This just shows that Karzai isn't in control of his own government,"
Solaiman said. "The Interior Ministry is run by the Panjshir Valley guys.
They don't answer to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   This is a fine way to treat American investors, the Faizi clan says.</TE>
<TE>   "We left good jobs in America and came back here to try to help
rebuild our country," Wais said. "If this can happen to us, American
citizens with a lot of connections, who's going to come here and invest?
Nobody."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be intimidated by these thugs," Wais said. "I'm
staying right here. This is my country. My father and mother were born
here. Anybody comes in this hotel trying to grab my father, he'll have
six bullet holes in him."</TE>
<TE>   A written request for comment on the family's allegations left with
Foreign Ministry officials in Kabul last week had not been answered as of
Wednesday. When a reporter attempted to interview Interior Ministry
officials, he was told that no one would speak to him because he was
staying at the Mustafa Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   It pains the American-raised brothers that some Afghans consider them
interlopers who returned only after the Taliban had been routed. They
point out that Mustafa and their father stayed in Kabul throughout the
years, watching over family interests.</TE>
<TE>   "As bad as the Taliban were, they never pulled anything like this,"
Solaiman said. "At least they respected the elders. They would never try
to intimidate my father."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Faizi family is keeping watch over the street from its
second-floor hotel redoubt. The merchants have not returned, and the
proprietor of a shop next door said they are plotting their next move.
The merchants' shops are locked and dark, and the icy Kabul winds whistle
through the broken glass. There is menace in the air.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent evening, Wais sat nursing his injuries, a handgun strapped
to his hip. He stared down at the gray streets smeared with dirty snow.
"It's not over," he said.</TE>

<HD>Heat's on Senate After Campaign Reform Victory</HD>
<DH>Congress: House passes historic measure to curb political spending,
and its foes are urged to concede. But last-ditch filibuster is
threatened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Fresh from their triumph in the House, sponsors of campaign finance
reform legislation raised the pressure on Senate opponents Thursday to
concede the fight and allow final passage of the measure.</LD>
<LD>   Hours after the House passed the landmark measure, Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters he would seek to call it up as
soon as it arrives in his chamber, probably the week after next. Daschle
asserted that he had at least the 60 votes needed to force action.</LD>
<LD>   "It's over," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the leading Senate
advocate of the bill. "We've got to get back together and work on other
issues."</LD>
<TE>   But the top Senate foe of campaign finance reform, Sen. Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.), held out the possibility of a last-ditch filibuster to
squelch a bill that he says would harm political parties and impose
unconstitutional restrictions on free speech.</TE>
<TE>   Before deciding what to do, McConnell said he would spend next week's
congressional recess studying the fine print of the House-passed bill,
which would ban the unlimited donations to national political parties
known as soft money.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we're now shooting real bullets, and we're talking about the
potential of a real law, we want to be absolutely certain what's in it,"
McConnell told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, the Senate voted, 59 to 41, for a campaign finance bill
nearly identical to the measure the House passed early Thursday by 240 to
189.</TE>
<TE>   If the Senate consents to the minor House-passed changes in its
bill--the strategy that advocates plan to pursue--that would send the
measure to the White House. President Bush's aides continued to say
nothing to encourage foes of the legislation that a veto was likely or
even possible.</TE>
<TE>   Reform advocates were boosted when Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.),
who voted against the bill last year, said Thursday he would support
breaking a filibuster and vote for final passage. That would give
advocates the 60 votes they need to break a filibuster--if they could
keep all 59 of their previous supporters in line.</TE>
<TE>   But McConnell said that if he could convince 41 of the Senate's 49
Republicans that the House-passed bill would work to the disadvantage of
the party, he could persuade them to maintain a filibuster. He said the
filibuster would end only when the bill's advocates agreed to appoint a
House-Senate conference committee to iron out the small differences
between the two versions of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Such a conference would be perilous for the legislation. House
Republican leaders could load the House delegation to the committee with
opponents of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Yet McConnell found provisions of the House-passed bill to praise,
suggesting that Republicans might let the bill become law and then attack
it in court.</TE>
<TE>   While he disparaged the soft money ban and proposed new regulations on
political advertising by interest groups, he endorsed a provision of the
House-passed bill that would raise the campaign contribution limits for
individual donors to $95,000 every two years, up from the current
$50,000.</TE>
<TE>   "As you can see, I'm somewhat conflicted," McConnell said. "There are
parts I like, parts I don't like." McConnell promised, however, to be the
lead plaintiff in a legal challenge to the bill should it become law.</TE>
<TE>   There was no sign that Bush would get in the way. Asked for Bush's
opinion of the House-passed bill, White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said: "The president has been very clear that he wants to sign
a bill that improves the current system. Parts of that legislation surely
do."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bush came out in favor of a ban on soft money contributions
by corporations and labor unions. But the president has not called for a
ban on such donations by wealthy individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The lengthy House debate, which began Tuesday night and concluded
shortly before 3 a.m. Thursday, highlighted the political dilemmas for
Bush. Some of his strongest supporters were vehemently opposed to the
legislation--including GOP leaders and an array of special interest
groups.</TE>
<TE>   The National Rifle Assn., for instance, joined with House GOP leaders
to sponsor an amendment to create an exception in the proposed
regulations for any political advertising that pertained to the 2nd
Amendment, which addresses the right to bear arms. The amendment failed
on a 219-209 vote in the closest call for the pro-reform coalition.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, 41 House Republicans joined with 198 Democrats and one
independent to vote for final passage. Among the dissident Republicans
were Reps. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento), Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs) and
Stephen Horn (R-Long Beach), the only three lawmakers in the state's
20-member GOP delegation to support the bill. Bono, however, voted for
the NRA amendment.</TE>
<TE>   California's 32-member House Democratic delegation voted as one
against the amendment and for the campaign finance reform bill.</TE>
<TE>   As they celebrated their victory, reform advocates said that some of
the toughest votes were cast by Republican freshmen in defiance of their
leaders. Rep. Todd Russell Platts (R-Pa.), for instance, supported the
bill on final passage and opposed the NRA amendment. "I voted my
conscience," Platts said. "It's something I believe in. To me, [politics]
is not about money, it's about people."</TE>
<TE>   Platts, who appeared at a news conference with House Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), McCain and other reform advocates, said he
had "very frank" talks with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) before the
vote. Last week, the speaker had exhorted his party's rank and file to
help defeat the bill, asserting that it could threaten GOP control of the
House. But Platts said he never felt threatened. Asked whether his future
standing in the party would suffer, Platts said: "Others will have to
speak to that."</TE>

<HD>War, on Advice of Counsel</HD>
<DH>Every U.S. strike and raid is vetted by the attorneys versed in
international combat rules. Did one ruling help Taliban leader avoid a
missile attack?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When Air Force targeters in Afghanistan spotted a Taliban convoy
rumbling along a road near Kandahar on a dark October night, they asked
permission to strike.</LD>
<LD>   A Pentagon lawyer advised against it, fearing civilians might be
killed. The convoy moved forward, allowing the Taliban to reinforce
troops faced off against the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance.</LD>
<LD>   A week earlier, it was a lawyer, operating at the right hand of
commanding Gen. Tommy R. Franks, who at first advised against firing a
missile at a line of Jeeps that intelligence officials believed was
carrying Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. The lawyer feared the
attack might violate a policy against assassinating a head of state.</LD>
<TE>   By the time missile operators got the go-ahead, the Jeeps had escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The two incidents, each related separately by senior Pentagon lawyers
and by military officials involved in the targeting process in
Afghanistan, highlight growing tensions in the war room as legal advisors
take on a more prominent role in military operations.</TE>
<TE>   In today's war, every bombing run, every missile firing, every raid by
U.S. soldiers is vetted by teams of lawyers who are experts on
international rules of war.</TE>
<TE>   There are lawyers in the top-secret operations center, called The
Tank, deep inside the Pentagon, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
signing off on the legality of raids and strikes. There are lawyers at
the Combined Air Operations Center at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi
Arabia, poring over lists of potential bombing targets. Teams of lawyers
based on aircraft carriers brief Navy pilots on what they can and can't
shoot before they jet off into Afghan skies. Military lawyers on the
ground in Kandahar and Bagram work hand in hand with U.S. commandos. When
special operations forces head out on top-secret missions, a lawyer is
often at their side.</TE>
<TE>   In the two convoy incidents, accounts differ on whether the lawyers'
advice was the critical factor in Franks' decision to hold fire. But the
disparate versions of what happened only serve to heighten the
controversy over the lawyers' role.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a decision by the people running this war to rely on the
advice of the lawyers to a greater degree than they have before," said
one senior Air Force commander privy to war room discussions who agreed
to speak on condition of anonymity. "It seems like there has been undue
influence given to the lawyers in not just one decision, but many."</TE>
<TE>   As recently as a dozen years ago, the idea of putting lawyers in the
war room with commanding officers was unthinkable. But with military
operations increasingly constrained by a complex web of international
laws, agreements, accords and treaties, lawyers have moved to the
forefront.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers parachuted in with special operations forces to Panama in
1989, flew with Army troops to Haiti in 1994 and were deployed by the
hundreds in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, sleeping in the
sand alongside troops in the field. The lawyers--judge advocate generals,
or JAGs in military parlance--reviewed airstrikes over Kosovo from an
operations center in Germany and the movements of special operations and
Army soldiers in Somalia and Rwanda. They rode into Macedonia with Army
brigades and flew in the airborne operations command post over Haiti.
They are permanently stationed in the Sinai, South Korea and Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   "You might say that, for better or worse, we're unleashing an army of
lawyers," said Alfred P. Rubin, a former Pentagon lawyer in the office of
the secretary of Defense and now a professor at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.</TE>
<TE>   As their visibility and their power have grown, so has the lawyers'
cachet.</TE>
<TE>   "There you are, sitting there with the commanders," said Air Force Lt.
Col. Nancy Richards, an operational lawyer deployed for the Iraq, Somalia
and Rwanda conflicts, "when he turns and says, 'Lawyer, what do you
think, do we have the legal authority?' . . . Just to be able to look at
a target the next day and think, I looked at that target and last night
they bombed it. It's a unique opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The unconventional and unprecedented war on terrorism has made the
legal thicket even more dense.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, America's adversaries wore no uniforms and fought
without traditional command structures under the leadership of people who
never formally declared war on the United States. Led by religious
zealots hiding in caves, the fighters waged war for a terrorist network
and a militia that bear no relation to governments in the traditional
sense.</TE>
<TE>   Warriors shifted sides from one day to the next and hid weapons,
ammunition and troops in mosques, houses, markets and cultural sites. It
became difficult for U.S. commanders to know whether their forces had hit
friend or foe.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has sought to minimize the chance of disastrous mistaken
air attacks by instituting stringent rules on targeting. Commanders,
pilots, intelligence analysts and spotters on the ground nominate lists
of targets they think are valid. Those nominations are then collected in
computerized folders and analyzed by intelligence officials.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers, often seated at the right hand of commanders, vet the list to
determine whether the target is being used for a military purpose and to
judge whether the potential for civilian deaths is clearly outweighed by
the military utility of the strike. The lawyers review the types of
munitions commanders plan to use to ensure that what is ultimately
dropped is least likely to harm civilians. They can recommend a bomb be
dropped at a different angle or at a different time to minimize civilian
deaths. The final decision is the commander's.</TE>
<TE>   As the fight moves beyond Afghanistan, the legal issues become
thornier yet. Military lawyers have been charged with determining the
legal constraints on conducting military operations in countries such as
Yemen, Sudan, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, whose legitimate governments to
varying degrees tolerate terrorists or their supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The old adage that "all's fair in love and war" hasn't been true for
at least a century, but the detailed involvement of lawyers in
battlefield decisions is relatively recent.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, both sides deliberately bombed civilian
populations to destroy factories and instill fear. After Vietnam, a
military still reeling from criticism of the 1968 My Lai massacre, in
which U.S. forces killed hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians,
required military lawyers for the first time to review combat plans for
compliance with international conventions and treaties.</TE>
<TE>   But their role was limited until the 1980s, when the Joint Chiefs of
Staff codified an expanded role for military lawyers, emphasizing for the
first time their importance in every phase of operations. The memorandum
required that all operational plans, contingency plans and rules of
engagement be reviewed by lawyers for compliance with the international
Law of War and with U.S. domestic law.</TE>
<TE>   The Law of War is a code of conduct agreed to by signatories of the
1949 Geneva Convention and the 1907 Law of the Hague and their subsequent
revisions. The two documents are designed to protect innocent civilians
and provide rights for combatants.</TE>
<TE>   The two conventions are not enforceable in the domestic legal sense.
There is no permanent international body that polices violations of
international law. Domestic courts can try individuals for violations of
the conventions but rarely do. International tribunals have in some
instances been set up to enforce the laws, most notably after World War
II and the 1994 civil war in Rwanda.</TE>
<TE>   But enforceable or not, the United States seeks to adhere to the
conventions in order to convince its citizens and other governments that
its actions are not just moral, but legal.</TE>
<TE>   "As one Marine once summarized, the military's job is to kill people
and break things, and yet they are being asked to engage in a delicate
form of international security policy," said Joseph Montville, director
of the preventive diplomacy program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. "I think the highest policy levels
want to make sure they have a legal case."</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. military has seeded its ranks with lawyers at all levels,
there is a concern that commanders have in some cases ceded their place
as the ultimate decision makers to legal advisors whose advice should
never be the final word.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk is [that] in a society or a situation where people are often
being second-guessed, it is awfully easy for the line commander to simply
rely on the advice of the lawyer, particularly if the advice is to not
shoot," said retired Rear Adm. John Hutson, judge advocate general for
the Navy until 2000. "That's safe. It is the path of least resistance."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Taliban military convoy reinforcing positions
against the Northern Alliance in October, Air Force targeters on the
ground privy to intelligence reports on the convoy told their commanders
it was a prime target, an Air Force general said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Central Command's top lawyer, Navy Capt. Shelly Young, advised
against the strike, worried that there were indications that women and
children might be in the convoy, the senior officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Young declined through a spokesman to be interviewed for this article.
But two senior operational lawyers at the Pentagon confirmed the account.</TE>
<TE>   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, spokesman for Central Command, wrote in an
e-mail reply to a request to speak to Young that her role "is typical of
other Judge Advocate Generals in advising their bosses on the legal
aspects of target selection.</TE>
<TE>   "She was never in a position to 'stop' any attack (nor is any JAG
anywhere). That is the prerogative of Franks and other operational
commanders alone."</TE>
<TE>   Under the Geneva Convention, warring nations are required to weigh the
military effect of their actions against the likelihood of civilian
deaths. And neither civilians nor civilian institutions such as churches
and cultural sites are to be intentionally targeted.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the same lawyer's advice not to strike at the convoy
believed to be transporting Omar, two things gave Young pause, according
to lawyers and Air Force generals familiar with the discussions. The
Geneva Convention prohibits government-sponsored assassinations, and Omar
could be considered a foreign leader. And the aircraft carrying the
missile, an experimental Predator unmanned spy plane armed with a
Hellfire missile, had not been vetted by legal staff for use as a weapon.
Under Pentagon protocols, weapons must not be deemed unnecessarily cruel
or capable of doing disproportionate damage to non-targets.</TE>
<TE>   There is an element of the absurd to such legal distinctions. A
bayonet with a hook on its end developed by the Pentagon in the 1960s,
for example, was rejected by lawyers, who judged that the hook mechanism
was unnecessarily cruel. But America's nuclear arsenal, with the
capability to kill many thousands of civilians, is considered legal.</TE>
<TE>   While fighters complain that the lawyers wield too much power to halt
military operations, human rights advocates complain that they wield too
little. Two recent U.S. attacks in Afghanistan, for example, are being
investigated on suspicion that they killed numerous innocent civilians.</TE>
<TE>   In October, American bombs twice hit a Kabul warehouse belonging to
the International Committee of the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Strikes against clearly marked Red Cross facilities are prohibited
under the Geneva Convention.</TE>
<TE>   "When they blew up that Red Cross warehouse twice in a row and said
they knew what they were doing, I have problems with that," said Francis
A. Boyle, a professor of international law and an expert on laws of war
at the University of Illinois College of Law. "I think decisions are
clearly made not to adhere to the rules of war at the highest levels."</TE>
<TE>   While Pentagon officials have acknowledged that the second attack on
the warehouse may have been a mistake, they defend the initial decision
to strike.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of evidence that the area with the Red Cross on the
warehouse, that warehouses in the immediate area were being used by the
Al Qaeda, and it is not immediately clear that the warehouse that the
ICRC used was not also being used by the Taliban," a senior military
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an incredible complexity here that does not exist in
force-on-force warfare in a World War II sense."</TE>
<TE>   So the well-meaning efforts to make war a little less brutal has not
made the targeting process--or the role of lawyers in it--any less
controversial, much less eliminated the risk of civilian casualties.</TE>
<TE>   While paid to uphold the law, ultimately the lawyers' loyalty is to
their commanders and to the military mission. It was the office of judge
advocate general for the Air Force, for example, that in 1977 approved
the use of cluster bombs. But the legality of the bombs, which disperse
hundreds or thousands of tiny explosives over an area, has been disputed
time and again in the years since, because they are more likely than
other precision munitions to inadvertently strike civilians near a
military target.</TE>
<TE>   "The lawyers have to be the ones who aren't afraid to tell the
commanders no," said Richards, the operational lawyer. "And there is a
problem, because the general tendency is, you want to be able to
accomplish the mission and help as much as possible. The burden is on
lawyers to not be an obstacle to the mission."</TE>

<HD>In Texas, Cloning Advance Comes on Little Cat Feat</HD>
<DH>Science: Birth brings technology 'into daily human life,' paves way
for commercial service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Researchers in Texas said Thursday that they had produced the first
cat through cloning, a button-cute, domestic short-haired kitten named CC
for "carbon copy."</LD>
<LD>   Where every other cat in history has had two parents, CC's genetic
material comes from a single adult cat, named Rainbow. She was born
through Caesarean section Dec. 22 in a laboratory at Texas A&amp;M
University.</LD>
<LD>   As a scientific matter, CC's birth confirms that cloning is a durable
technology that can be applied to many species, and perhaps one day to
humans. But the bigger effect may come from the fact that CC is the first
companion animal to be created through cloning, paving the way for pet
cloning to become a commercial service.</LD>
<TE>   "We've cloned agricultural animals--cattle and sheep and goats. But
this really brings it into daily human life," said Philip Damiani, a
cloning expert at the Audubon Nature Institute in New Orleans, which is
also trying to clone cats.</TE>
<TE>   A private company, Texas-based Genetic Savings &amp; Clone, has the right
to license the Texas A&amp;M cloning technique. The company said Thursday
that it would take at least a year to perfect the service. "We hope to
keep it at about $20,000 to begin with . . . but the cost could be double
that," said General Manager Charles Long.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of pet owners have already paid fees of $800 or more merely
to save cells from their pets for cloning, suggesting there is a strong
demand for the service.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is spiffy," said Phyllis Sherman Raschke, of San
Fernando, who has preserved cells from her late Cornish Rex, Sammy. "When
you think of all the terrible things in the world, it's kind of dingy to
think of reviving a cat. But this is wonderful news."</TE>
<TE>   It is not to everyone. CC's birth comes amid an emotional debate in
Congress over whether to outlaw human cloning. Some scientists say any
ban should be narrowly written so that cloning remains a legal tool in
medical research. But CC could add to the sense that scientists, if not
strictly regulated, will inevitably produce a human clone.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, several animal welfare groups say cat cloning is
ill-advised, given that millions of animals are euthanized each year at
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "We all understand the impulse to hold on to an animal you love, but
this is the wrong way to do it," said Wayne Pacelle, senior vice
president at the Humane Society of the United States. "The best response
is to allow for grieving to occur and then go to a shelter and find a new
companion and provide a home for an animal in need."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Mark Westhusin, leader of the Texas A&amp;M team, said the project
contributed to scientists' understanding of cloning and animal
science--"the changes that come up in physiology between doing the cow
and the goat versus the pig and the calf."</TE>
<TE>   Important differences among species have made it easier to clone some
than others. Sheep, pigs, cattle, goats and mice have successfully been
cloned. But Westhusin and his colleagues, in conjunction with Genetic
Savings &amp; Clone, have made a major effort to clone dogs and so far have
not announced any success. Among other problems, dog egg cells have
proved difficult to work with, Westhusin said.</TE>
<TE>   To produce CC, Westhusin and his colleagues took a cell from Rainbow
and fused it with an egg cell that had been stripped of its own DNA. The
result was an egg cell from one cat with genetic material entirely from
Rainbow.</TE>
<TE>   The egg was then induced to divide into an embryo, which was
transferred to a surrogate mother named Allie.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the Texas A&amp;M team produced 87 cloned embryos, most of which
failed to grow, before hitting success with CC, who appears to be healthy
in every way. The team ultimately succeeded using a type of cell from
Rainbow that is found only in females, suggesting that more work is
needed before males can be cloned.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas team reported its results in the journal Nature, which
subjected them to review by independent scientists. News of the birth was
first reported Thursday by the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   While Rainbow and CC look similar, their coats are not identical. This
is because conditions in the womb affect an animal's coloration.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many people confuse cloning with resurrection. It's just another
form of reproduction," Westhusin said.</TE>
<TE>   The cat and dog cloning efforts at Texas A&amp;M are funded by an
anonymous investor, who has put up $3.7 million so far. Multiple news
reports have identified the investor as John Sperling, the 81-year-old
chairman of the holding company Apollo Group Inc. and founder of the
University of Phoenix, a for-profit school known for its online course
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Westhusin said Texas A&amp;M had applied for patents on the cat cloning
process, but he said he did not know whether those patents, if granted,
would be so broad as to give the university exclusive control of the
market for cat cloning services.</TE>
<TE>   While many people lavish money on their pets, a large market for
cloning might not develop until the technology matures for several years
and becomes affordable.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to do it, but I would wait until the bugs are worked out
and for the price to be reasonable," said Lisa Johnson of Seattle, who
lost her cat, Cowcat, in a hit-and-run car accident two years ago.
Johnson said she might buy the service at $5,000 or $10,000, well below
the initial $20,000 price envisioned by Genetic Savings &amp; Clone.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said she knew Cowcat could never be revived, but she hoped to
get back some of the qualities she loved--his intelligence and ability to
communicate with her.</TE>
<TE>   Raschke, a retired probation officer, acknowledged that pet cloning
strikes some people as frivolous. "I think a fur coat is frivolous," she
said. "But people tend to acquire things because they like them. Some
people get huge diamond rings. I like cats."</TE>

<HD>Milosevic Says He's the Victim</HD>
<DH>Tribunal: In opening remarks, ex-Yugoslav leader denies charges,
calls trial the real crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>Slobodan Milosevic finally got his day in court Thursday, and he
made the most of it.</LD>
<LD>   Representing himself in his war crimes trial at the international
court here, the former Yugoslav president unloaded an opening salvo
portraying himself as the victim of a hypocritical Western conspiracy.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic denied the charges of genocide and crimes against humanity,
claiming that the thousands slain and hundreds of thousands driven out of
Serbia's Kosovo province three years ago were mostly victims of a civil
war between Serbs and ethnic Albanian terrorists--and, later, NATO
airstrikes.</LD>
<TE>   Milosevic's opening statement was an aggressive, essentially political
attempt to turn the proceedings into a trial of the Western nations that
he accuses of committing war crimes themselves during the 11-week bombing
campaign and then "crucifying" him.</TE>
<TE>   "Concealing one crime with another is something that criminals often
do," Milosevic declared. "This show, which is supposed to take place
under the guise of a trial, is actually a crime against a sovereign
state, against the Serb people, against me. You wish to try me for things
carried out in the capacity of the head of the state in defense of our
state and to defend our people from terrorism and from the greatest
military machinery the world ever had."</TE>
<TE>   For more than four hours, Milosevic engaged in courtroom theater. He
compared his enemies to Nazis and inquisitors. He displayed photos of
dismembered, decapitated and charred corpses of civilians who he said
were killed by North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombardments. He
growled and thundered and murmured, his voice and emotions rising and
falling in a controlled performance that, although conscious of a
worldwide audience, appeared directed primarily at his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic seems intent on salvaging his legacy at home. He made a
fervent appeal to Serbian sentiments of patriotism and victimization. The
former president wore a striped tie in the colors of the Serbian flag and
spoke almost exclusively in Serbian, in contrast to pretrial hearings,
during which he spoke in English. Serbia is the dominant Yugoslav
republic.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, he bristled with nationalist indignation at a
prosecutor's comment earlier this week about the location of
conflict-torn Kosovo, which Serbs consider their hallowed heartland.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you dare say Kosovo borders with Serbia?" Milosevic demanded.
"Kosovo is Serbia. The Hague does not 'border' the Netherlands. If you do
not know that, someone can tell you."</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic refuses to accept the legitimacy of the court. A lawyer by
training, he is representing himself. On Thursday, he painted himself as
a feisty underdog and made caustic references to unnamed "bosses" of the
prosecutors and their internationally funded budget.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a single element of a fair trial," he said. "There's an
enormous apparatus on one side. A vast media structure on that same side.
All kinds of services . . . everything's at your disposal. What's on my
side? I only have a public telephone booth in the prison. That's the only
thing I have available in order to face here the most terrible kind of
libel against my country, my people and me."</TE>
<TE>   Yet as the day wore on, Milosevic offered a rebuttal of sorts to the
prosecution's two-day opening statement. Countering the charge that his
aim of creating a "Greater Serbia" was the motive for crimes against
humanity, he said Serbs fought an international legion of Islamic holy
warriors in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. He also said Serbs had battled
Kosovo guerrillas bent on creating a "Greater Albania."</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans go to the other side of the globe to fight terrorism,
and that is considered logical and normal," he said, jabbing a finger in
the air. "Whereas our struggle against terrorism in the heart of our own
country is considered a crime."</TE>
<TE>   He claimed to have opposed the brutal shelling of Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, by his Bosnian Serb allies during that former Yugoslav
republic's 1992-95 war. He said he was unaware of the existence of
inhumane Bosnian Serb detention camps. He said ethnic Albanian terrorists
and the fear of airstrikes, not Serbian marauders, provoked the exodus of
850,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Prisoners of war and unarmed persons were held sacred," he said.
"Whoever violated human rights was held accountable. This was not done by
the army and police. They defended their country with honor and
chivalry."</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic may have scored a point when he said prosecutors unfairly
quoted a snippet of a 1989 speech to make him sound warlike. He read
other excerpts of the text that extolled ethnic harmony and called for a
nonviolent "battle" for prosperity and progress.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he tried to exploit the fact that the system of
international justice in which he has become entangled is nascent,
complicated and sometimes ambiguous. He questioned the legality of his
arrest and extradition from Yugoslavia and demanded a hearing on the
issue. He pointed out that NATO carried out the aerial campaign without
the approval of the U.N. Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   And in a reminder that world leaders negotiated with him for years, he
dropped names: U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, French President Jacques Chirac. With
considerable relish, Milosevic recounted a statement in which Chirac said
he had vetoed NATO plans to bomb a bridge in Belgrade, the Yugoslav and
Serbian capital. Milosevic said he plans to summon the French president
and others as witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe that Milosevic would love to see former President Clinton
and other nemeses squirming on the witness stand. The tribunal's limited
subpoena powers make that unlikely, but Milosevic will have the right to
cross-examine diplomats, military officers and others expected to take
the stand as prosecution witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic accused NATO of intentionally killing civilians, including
ethnic Albanians who he said were returning to their villages rather than
fleeing. But that statement undercut what he said was the pretext for
NATO's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   NATO officials have apologized for the deaths of civilians in 1999 and
said that those casualties were unintentional.</TE>
<TE>   During the last hour of his speech, which will continue today,
Milosevic tried to counter the litany of horrors presented by
prosecutors. He plowed through a long, detailed list of casualties and
damage left by the NATO bombardments, evidence that was disturbing but,
analysts said, tenuously connected to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   With terse instructions to a court clerk operating a projector,
Milosevic narrated grotesque images of corpses, identifying some victims
by name: "That's a little girl. Maritza. . . . These are corpses of
refugees--as you can see, most of them are females. . . . All these
people were traveling by train. That's the only crime they had
committed."</TE>
<TE>   And then the man who reigned during war and devastation added, "Or
perhaps [it's] because they were citizens of Serbia."</TE>

<HD>1.6 Million Cherokees Are Recalled</HD>
<DH>Safety: Chrysler issues order after complaints SUVs slipped into
gear. Five people have died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Chrysler announced the recall of 1.6 million Jeep Grand Cherokee
sport-utility vehicles Thursday in response to a series of accidents in
which the vehicles unexpectedly lurched into reverse, causing at least
five deaths and more than 150 injuries.</LD>
<LD>   A federal safety agency investigating the problem had received more
than 700 complaints from owners of the popular SUVs, who reported that
their Grand Cherokees could slip into reverse when the gearshift appeared
to be in the park position. In most cases, the engine was running at the
time.</LD>
<LD>   The broad recall covers Grand Cherokees produced from 1993 to 1998.
The Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler Corp., said its dealers
will install an additional part in the floor shifter mechanism to prevent
the problem at no cost to consumers.</LD>
<TE>   "Although there are several ways for Jeep Grand Cherokee owners to
assure their vehicle is in park, this improvement will provide one more
way to assist customers by making it more difficult for a driver to fail
to put the gear shifter fully in park," said Matt Reynolds, Chrysler's
safety director. The company said it still believes that the vehicles are
not defective.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an
investigation into the Grand Cherokee this summer, after The Times
contacted the agency about a number of complaints from consumers.</TE>
<TE>   One Jeep Cherokee owner, Jacquee Kahn of Los Angeles, told The Times
that her 1997 Grand Cherokee rolled backward while she was refueling at a
gas station near one of the city's busiest intersections--Santa Monica
and Westwood boulevards--just before Christmas 1999. The engine was off,
and the Jeep--with her sister in it--rolled into a gas pump. Neither
woman was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Later, The Times reported on previously undisclosed deaths blamed on
the problem and on several lawsuits in which Chrysler entered into
confidential settlements with consumers.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA spokesman Rae Tyson said the safety agency will continue to
investigate 1999-2001 Grand Cherokees. The government has received 174
complaints about these later-model Jeeps, including 61 reported crashes
and 32 injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to keep the investigation open on the newer vehicles
just to make sure there isn't a problem there as well," Tyson said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler spokesman Mike Rosenau contended that the complaint rate for
those vehicles is not significantly different than for similar SUVs built
by other manufacturers. He said the 1999-2001 models have a safeguard
similar to the one that will be installed in the earlier models.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenau said that it will be several months before Chrysler can
produce enough of the parts to begin repairs but that the company is
sending out an immediate notice to Grand Cherokee owners, with tips on
how to make sure their vehicles are securely parked. Turning the engine
off, removing the ignition key and setting the parking brake should
prevent the problem, according to safety experts.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA will monitor the recall to make sure the company follows
through.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure . . . hope that what they are doing will correct this defect,"
said Morton S. Bunis, a New Jersey lawyer whose daughter, Linda Haller,
was crushed to death by her Grand Cherokee in 1998. "I don't want to pick
up the newspaper again and read about anyone getting hurt because their
car went from park into reverse." Haller's family is suing
DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Tamny, an Ohio engineer who has testified for several plaintiffs
against the company, said the fix announced by Chrysler "is a step in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly an improvement, but it will take some testing to see
how good it is," Tamny said. He gave a rough estimate of $100 to $150 per
vehicle to make the repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The company would not release its cost estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Tamny said that a poorly designed internal component can allow the
Grand Cherokee's transmission to come to a rest in an unstable position
between park and reverse. To the driver, the vehicle will feel like it is
in park. But a door slamming or the motor revving up to power an air
conditioner can create vibrations that cause the vehicle to slip into
reverse, according to Tamny.</TE>
<TE>   The fix that Chrysler is proposing will not replace that internal
component, commonly called a "rooster comb."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Rosenau said, the company will install a new part in the
gearshift mechanism. This part is designed to eliminate chances that the
transmission could come to a rest between park and reverse. "It has a
very acute point between park and reverse, so there will be no ambiguity
for drivers," Rosenau said.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Chrysler had steadfastly resisted a recall, saying it
believed that drivers who inadvertently left Grand Cherokees in reverse
were to blame. Safety director Reynolds said Thursday that "the
investigation did not identify any defect in the vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you do this if there is no defect?" Tamny asked. "It's not
as if this is something that's cost-free." The company said it was acting
to resolve consumer concerns.</TE>
<TE>   But according to NHTSA documents, its investigators became quickly
convinced that something was indeed wrong. In July, when the probe was in
its early stages, agency engineer Peter Kivett, the lead investigator on
the case, test drove a Grand Cherokee that a consumer had complained
about.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigator was able to duplicate the complaint," an agency
report said. "The vehicle engaged reverse while it was in the park
position. . . . A total of three park-to-reverse failures occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Safety officials also found that the rate of consumer complaints
involving Grand Cherokees that slipped into reverse was more than five
times greater than for the nearest SUV built by a competitor. In
November, the agency intensified its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the recall of more than 1 million vehicles is unusual
but not unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Cherokee has been enormously popular with motorists since it
was launched in 1993. Lately, Chrysler has been advertising it as a
safety vehicle--"a 4,000-lb. guardian angel"--touting its advanced air
bags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes and other features.</TE>
<TE>   A Minneapolis print shop owner who suffered a severe knee injury when
he was pinned to a loading dock by his 1996 Grand Cherokee is a testament
to the popularity of the brand. Alan Goltzman now owns a 2001 model.</TE>
<TE>   "I always said that I put it in park, but nobody believed me,"
Goltzman said. "I'm kind of shocked [by the recall]. Chrysler was so
adamant that there was nothing wrong. I think they're doing it so the
government doesn't force them to."</TE>

<HD>This Silver Medal May Have a Golden Lining</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Judging controversy could put a new spin on skaters'
careers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Canadian figure skaters are finding that the strange alchemy
created by their Olympic-sized controversy could transform their silver
medal into more valuable riches in the lucrative sports marketing arena.</LD>
<LD>   A day after missing out on the gold medal in a controversial judging
decision that has overshadowed everything else at the Winter Olympics,
skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier were schmoozing via satellite with
"Tonight Show" host Jay Leno. During a long-distance interview Wednesday,
CNN talk show host Larry King weighed in: "You got robbed, but you're
more famous for it."</LD>
<LD>   Famous, indeed. The skaters' business manager, a newcomer to the
close-knit world of skating, suddenly is fielding urgent calls from
reporters, talk show hosts and assorted deal-makers. The skaters could be
looking at starring roles in ice-skating tours and made-for-television
specials, and potential product endorsements.</LD>
<TE>   They aren't alone in preparing for such riches that may await the
biggest stars from the Games. Several skaters, including the Russian pair
who defeated Sale and Pelletier, are represented by Cleveland-based IMG,
a powerful sports marketing firm that owns a leading ice-skating revue
and produces skating shows for television.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had told me a couple of days ago that Jamie and David would be
in this position having lost the gold medal, I would have laughed at
you," Craig E. Fenech, their business manager, said Wednesday night. "The
events of the past 36 hours are astounding and probably unprecedented in
figure skating."</TE>
<TE>   But long-term commercial success for Sale and Pelletier is still not
assured.</TE>
<TE>   The two still risk adding their names to the lengthy list of talented
skating couples whose images quickly became lost amid the brighter lights
generated by the more glamorous women's singles competition. The sports
marketing pie from the Winter Games, traditionally smaller than from the
Summer Games, also has been reduced by the recession and post-attack
advertising cutbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Olympians have been snake-bit," said Bob Williams, a Chicago-based
sports marketing executive. "The Olympics come back to U.S. soil for the
last time in more than a decade, and they're greeted by Sept. 11 and the
biggest cutbacks in advertising history."</TE>
<TE>Competition for Marketing Contracts</TE>
<TE>   History suggests that Michelle Kwan and other high-profile women's
singles skaters are the favorites in the sports marketing arena. This
year there also could be some competition from U.S. speedskater Apolo
Anton Ohno and the trio of U.S. half-pipe snowboarders who swept the
medals. And, the commercial appeal of skaters Sale and Pelletier could
fade if the judging controversy lingers indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Skaters and skiers have used golden performances in recent Winter
Games as springboards to deals with such major companies as Nike, General
Mills Inc., United Airlines and Walt Disney Co. But few athletes have
managed to find sustained commercial success.</TE>
<TE>   "The days of the Peggy Flemings and Dorothy Hamills ringing the cash
register seem to be over," said Keith Bruce, a sports marketing expert
with advertising agency Foote Cone &amp; Belding in San Francisco, referring
to two former U.S. figure skating gold medalists.</TE>
<TE>   What's clear is that had Sale and Pelletier walked away from Monday
night's finals with gold in hand, "they would have been yesterday's
news," said Michael Rosenberg, a Palm Desert-based agent who has
represented top-flight figure skaters since 1978. "With one stroke of a
judge's mark, their silver medal has truly turned into platinum."</TE>
<TE>   The media storm that erupted after a panel of judges awarded the gold
to Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze is being compared to
the hurricane six years ago when the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan rivalry
slipped from the ice to the police blotter.</TE>
<TE>   The judging controversy is giving pairs skating more media attention
than it's had since the 1980 Lake Placid Games, when Randy Gardner
injured a muscle and, along with partner Tai Babilonia, withdrew from
competition just minutes before it began. But instead of fading into
obscurity, the couple opened an unexpected chapter of their professional
lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Had Randy and Tai skated in 1980 and won, they would have been
relegated to the history books," said Rosenberg, who served as their
agent. "But they didn't. And they got endorsements, NBC made a movie of
their life and they were the stars of every skating tour there was. They
were the heartbreak kids, America's sweethearts."</TE>
<TE>   Networks broadcasting the Olympics clearly relish controversy. Ratings
rose dramatically six years ago as the Harding-Kerrigan affair played
out. And, as any radio talk show host will attest, sports fans also love
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "The two biggest sports stories out there right now are the Canadian
skaters in Salt Lake City and Mike Tyson in Georgia," Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Image and manners are as important as talent and athletic prowess in
the mercurial world of sports marketing. Experts agree that the Canadians
are continuing to hit their marks in the wake of their near-flawless
Monday night performance.</TE>
<TE>   One sports marketing executive called the Canadians "a dream couple."
Another described them as "the honest, pure representation of what the
Olympics and sports are all about, and they've both handled themselves in
a classy way, without taking swipes at anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Sale's perky, ear-to-ear smile is infectious, they say, and
Pelletier's free spirit was immediately evident Monday night when the
tall skater fell to his knees and kissed the ice. Whether it's good
sportsmanship or good coaching, the two clearly are playing the role of
gracious losers victimized by a flawed system.</TE>
<TE>   Though they're the reigning world champions--having beaten the same
Russian couple for the title--Sale and Pelletier are coming across as the
underdogs. That makes the couple even more appealing to Americans, even
if the skaters hail from the out-of-the-way towns of Red Deer, Alberta,
and Sayabec, Quebec.</TE>
<TE>   With their performance now on ice, the skaters will be meeting as much
with their business manager as with their coach. So will others.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian couple is represented by IMG, which represents Tiger Woods
and many other athletes and celebrities. IMG, not coincidentally, owns
the Stars on Ice skating show, and its television arm has produced such
recent shows as "Hallmark Skaters' Championship" and "Holiday Festival on
Ice."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier face significant decisions during the coming weeks,
including whether to turn professional.</TE>
<TE>   "If they choose to continue to skate, they can make a tremendous
amount of money," marketer Williams said. "The ice shows will want them
because they'll pack people into the seats. And they'll help these shows
to get better TV ratings."</TE>
<TE>   Fenech, their business manager, is a New Jersey businessman who has
represented athletes, coaches and sports writers during 20 years in the
business. But he's a newcomer to figure skating and Sale and Pelletier
are relatively new clients. So Fenech said he has immersed himself in
"the most intensive course in figure skating over the past year that you
could ever imagine."</TE>
<TE>   Off the ice, Fenech's goal is relatively simple: Use his clients'
new-found fame to jump-start business opportunities both on and off the
ice. Despite being the world pairs champions, Sale and Pelletier signed
just two endorsement deals in Canada--with Cheerios and
MasterCard--before the Winter Games. The couple wasn't included on lists
of most promising endorsement candidates that advertising and marketing
executives drew up before the Games.</TE>
<TE>No Guarantees, but Well-Positioned</TE>
<TE>   There are no guarantees that endorsement deals will fall into their
laps, but the skaters clearly are positioned to cash in on their unlikely
fame.</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier should benefit from their decision not to sign a
contract with any major ice-skating revues before the Games. The decision
wasn't without risk because the couple's show-business appeal normally
would have evaporated had they missed the gold. Also, individual skaters,
including Tara Lipinski, Kristi Yamaguchi and Kurt Browning,
traditionally are the headliners in made-for-television skating shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, the gamble is going to pay off because they're calling the
shots," agent Rosenberg said. "Suddenly, it's a seller's market."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier also have solidified their role as national heroes
in Canada, where their fame is expected to generate more endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   But the sports marketing arena can be as tricky to navigate as the
slick skating surface in the Salt Lake Ice Center. For starters, the
sports marketing industry is decidedly smaller in Canada than in the
U.S., and the value of endorsements is much lower.</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier turned down "a number of deals" while training for
the Olympics, Fenech said. "They didn't want to distract themselves from
their goal of winning a gold medal. Presumably, we'll be talking to those
people again, as well as some of those who are calling now."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is convinced that a silver medal and a judging
controversy represents the right stuff for a successful endorsement
career.</TE>
<TE>   "I might be the lone wolf, but I don't know if this will translate
into money for them," marketer Williams said. "Three months from now, I
doubt that Joe Average Consumer is going to remember why these skaters
didn't win."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians' run for sports-marketing gold arguably was advanced
when American skiing favorites Picabo Street and Jonny Moseley failed to
win gold medals. But the Canadians could find themselves overshadowed if
a relative unknown turns in a riveting performance. There's also the
undeniable star power of Kwan and the other high-powered women skaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the clean sweep in snowboarding, which already is ancient
news," said advertising agency executive Bruce. If any of the big three
American women singles skaters--Sasha Cohen, Sarah Hughes or Kwan--wins
gold, "that potentially becomes the story."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Militants Bomb Tank; 3 Israeli Soldiers Die</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Attack in Gaza Strip comes as politicians and military
analysts criticize army incursion that killed five.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>A powerful explosion ripped apart an Israeli tank in the Gaza Strip
on Thursday night, killing three soldiers and wounding another, an army
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack by militant Palestinians came as politicians and military
analysts criticized the army's incursion into several Gazan towns a day
earlier as a failure. In the broadest operation in Gaza since the
outbreak of fighting 16 1/2 months ago, dozens of tanks and hundreds of
troops had swept into northern Gazan towns with the stated mission of
thwarting Palestinian missile attacks on Israeli communities.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen hours later, the forces pulled out, and on Thursday the army
said it had released all but two of 18 Palestinians arrested during the
operation.</LD>
<TE>   "We can only pray that what we saw in the last 24 hours in Beit
Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and Deir al Balah is not really the IDF [Israel
Defense Forces]" of today, military analyst Alex Fishman wrote in the
newspaper Yediot Aharonot. "The real IDF is different: smarter, more
creative and less clumsy."</TE>
<TE>   Unnamed senior army officers were quoted in the Israeli press as
saying the government has exaggerated the importance of the Kassam-2
missiles developed by the Islamic militant group Hamas. The rockets, the
sources said, are highly inaccurate and probably cannot do much damage.
But by declaring that the missiles cross Israel's "red lines," the
government has raised the stakes for retaliation, the officers
complained.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians criticized the army for allegedly taking too long to
launch the Gaza incursion after Palestinians fired Kassam-2 rockets
Sunday that, for the first time, landed inside Israel. The rockets caused
no injuries. The lapse between the attack and the incursion allowed
leading militants to escape, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night's ambush on the Israeli tank is likely to intensify the
debate about army tactics and heighten tensions in the West Bank and
Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The violence began when Palestinians opened fire on a convoy guarded
by soldiers that was traveling to the isolated Jewish settlement of
Netzarim, in northwestern Gaza, army spokesman Jacob Dallal said.</TE>
<TE>   The army controls the main roads leading to settlements, which are
home to about 5,000 Israelis living in heavily guarded compounds
surrounded by more than 1 million Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   A roadside charge exploded next to an armored bus in the convoy but
caused no injuries. Reinforcements then rushed to the scene, including
the tank.</TE>
<TE>   Dallal said "a huge explosion" rocked the tank, destroying it and
killing three of its crew members. The attack was the first time "that
we've encountered something that could do this to a tank" in the West
Bank or Gaza, Dallal said. Authorities early today said an antitank mine
was used.</TE>
<TE>   He likened the attack to the sophisticated, deadly assaults carried
out against Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Muslim
militia, during Israel's 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement faxed to news agencies, the Popular Resistance
Committees claimed responsibility for the attack. The group is an
umbrella organization of militants from Palestinian factions linked by
their commitment to armed attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The statement said the group was retaliating for Israel's incursion
the day before and for the deaths of five Palestinian security officers
during the Israeli operation.</TE>
<TE>   "We exploded two big bombs when a Zionist convoy, including a settler
bus, was passing on the main road" between Netzarim and the Karni
crossing on the border between Gaza and pre-1967 Israel, the statement
said. It ended with a phrase borrowed from Israeli military statements
issued after operations: "All our fighters returned safely to base."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians in the Netzarim area reported Israeli helicopters
circling overhead and said soldiers were firing flares into the sky long
after the dead and wounded were evacuated in armored ambulances. Dallal
confirmed that troops were searching the area for the attackers.</TE>
<TE>   The ambush came as two European diplomats were shuttling between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, trying to generate interest in
implementing a cease-fire. British Foreign Minister Jack Straw and German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer were in Jerusalem for high-level talks,
but neither man was able to meet with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, whom
doctors confined to his Negev desert farm this week after he came down
with the flu.</TE>
<TE>   The two foreign ministers emphasized their concurrence with the Bush
administration that Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat must
rein in militants so that negotiations can resume.</TE>
<TE>   "The first steps that have to be taken are to make the life of the
people of Israel much more secure, and that means clamping down on
terrorism which comes from the occupied territories," Straw told
reporters after meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the army said this morning that its forces entered the
Palestinian-controlled village of Pzeita in the northern West Bank and
killed one Palestinian who had opened fire on them.</TE>

<HD>China Quells Sect Protests, Detains About 40 Westerners</HD>
<DH>Asia: Foreign members of the outlawed Falun Gong movement hold a
series of demonstrations in Tiananmen Square a week before Bush's visit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>About 40 Western followers of the outlawed Falun Gong meditation
group were taken away by police Thursday after they mounted a series of
protests in Tiananmen Square, the heart of the Chinese capital.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstrators breached tight security to hold up signs in support
of the banned movement, which the Chinese government has labeled an "evil
cult" intent on subverting the state. Police quickly subdued the
protesters and drove them away, according to a witness and a Falun Gong
spokeswoman in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The protests came exactly a week before President Bush is scheduled to
arrive in Beijing for a two-day visit. Falun Gong's supporters want him
to raise the issue of the ban on their movement and the Communist
regime's harsh repression of its members.</LD>
<TE>   The group, which preaches conservative social values mixed with an
eclectic blend of Buddhist and Taoist beliefs, claims millions of
followers in China, where religion has mounted a big comeback in the past
two decades. But since the government outlawed Falun Gong 2 1/2 years
ago, the number of open practitioners has dwindled amid an aggressive
campaign to root them out.</TE>
<TE>   The group alleges that at least 1,600 members have died from state
persecution, a number that cannot be independently verified. Thousands
more have been shipped to labor camps.</TE>
<TE>   Those detained Thursday were foreigners, including three who
reportedly live in the Los Angeles area, Falun Gong representatives said.
They probably will be expelled from China within a day or two, as has
been the case previously.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Sanchez of Pasadena said his daughter Gina, 29, also of
Pasadena, was in Beijing to join the demonstration and may have been
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Gina Sanchez, an herbalist and acupuncturist who practices in Santa
Monica, traveled to China with two other local followers of Falun Gong:
Mark Gardner, 22, a college student from Brea, and Albert Roman, 25, a
Palos Verdes Peninsula financial consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said his daughter called him several times a day until
Thursday, when her calls stopped. "I don't know for a fact she's been
arrested, but I'm assuming so because she should have called by now," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters slipped through a security cordon to get into Tiananmen
Square, a popular tourist spot jammed this week with people celebrating
the Chinese New Year. Police demanded to look at tourists' identity
papers and checked the bags of those entering the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign journalists were tailed throughout the day, in apparent
anticipation of the afternoon's events. In the past, Falun Gong
practitioners have used public holidays to stage larger demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   About 2 p.m., small clusters of adherents unfurled banners and shouted
slogans in different areas of the square, prompting police to rush in and
subdue them. Gail Rachlin, a Falun Gong spokeswoman in New York, said
some of the demonstrators were punched and kicked.</TE>
<TE>   State media accused the protesters of ruining the holiday spirit.
"This turmoil at the center of the Chinese capital was aimed to undermine
the happy atmosphere of the [new year]," the official New China News
Agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The protest was at least the fourth in the last six months involving
foreign members of Falun Gong. Earlier this week, two North American
practitioners were expelled after demonstrating in Tiananmen Square. In
November, a few dozen Westerners took part in a protest similar to
Thursday's demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   The latest show of defiance was timed to coincide with the lunar new
year but also to draw attention to the crackdown on Falun Gong before
Bush's planned visit.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Bush may well bring up the issue of religious freedom
with Chinese leaders. But any mention is likely to concentrate on
Christians in China, millions of whom worship in underground churches.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, headlines around the world focused on the arrest, conviction
and release of a Hong Kong man accused of smuggling Bibles into China for
distribution to an unregistered Christian sect.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Falun Gong has faded somewhat from world view after
exploding into prominence in April 1999, when thousands of adherents
surrounded the central government compound in Beijing to complain about
bad publicity the group had received. Falun Gong was banned three months
later.</TE>
<TE>   In part, its lowered profile over the past year reflects the
authorities' success in stamping out Falun Gong or driving its adherents
deep underground, especially after several suspected practitioners
immolated themselves in Beijing in January 2001--an event that helped
harden public attitudes toward the group.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Bahrain's Emir Decides It's Better to Be King</HD>
<DH>Mideast: In giving himself a promotion, Hamed also sets vote to
restore parliament. But handpicked legislators will help pass law.</DH>

<LD>When does an emir get to become a king? When he says so.</LD>
<LD>   That may sound like some obscure monarchy joke, but it was in fact a
historic moment Thursday in the tiny Persian Gulf emirate of Bahrain,
where, with a stroke of his pen, Sheik Hamed ibn Isa Khalifa anointed
himself king.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, a king can't be king without a kingdom, so map makers will
have to get busy and rename the sliver of oil-producing sand "the Kingdom
of Bahrain"--just like its big cousin next door, the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia.</LD>
<TE>   But unlike Saudi Arabia, where the royal family rules with a heavy
hand, this kingdom will incorporate elements of democracy, making it a
standout in a region where, generally, rulers rule as they like.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing his promotion, the fledgling king also approved plans to
create a constitutional monarchy. He called for the first parliamentary
elections in more than two decades to be held in October and municipal
elections in May.</TE>
<TE>   "We are keen to resume democratic life as soon as possible for the
glory of Bahrain, its prosperity and development," his royal highness
said in a nationally televised address Thursday. "Men and women will be
allowed to vote and run for office."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, this country of just 650,000 people was in the grip
of a violent uprising. Bombs rocked the capital, Manama, destroying
banks, offices and hotels, and the jails were filled with political
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, the new king's father, Sheik Isa ibn Salman Khalifa, had
imposed an emergency law under which anyone could be arrested and held
for up to three years without being charged. Over the years, thousands of
people were arrested, locked up or exiled. He also suspended the
constitution and dissolved parliament.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the emir died and his son took over.</TE>
<TE>   Hamed shook the nation to the core. He opened the jails and released
all political prisoners. He welcomed home all exiles. He suspended the
dreaded emergency law. His idea was to begin to combat extremism by
respecting human rights and allowing room for political opposition.</TE>
<TE>   His plans, which were overwhelmingly approved in a national referendum
more than a year ago, called for creating a bicameral legislature with an
elected lower house and an appointed upper house.</TE>
<TE>   Amid all of this pro-democracy hype, however, there was no mention of
the emir's pending kingship. In substance, it makes little difference,
because the monarchy is hereditary, and Hamed's son, the crown prince,
will succeed his father, whether as king or emir. Nonetheless, people
were a bit surprised by Thursday's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether he is a king or a prince, it is no big change," said Mundhir
Khoor, an officer in the Bahrain Human Rights Society. "It is just a big
fuss, a big bang, that is all. It is a big noise. It is not important."</TE>
<TE>   The king did make it clear that despite his nod toward modernity, he
isn't turning complete control over to an elected parliament. The
original plans called for only the lower elected house to have
legislative power, but the king announced Thursday that his handpicked
upper house will also be involved in passing legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a strange change in attitude," Khoor said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is a relatively poor relation among the oil-rich Persian
Gulf countries, Bahrain hosts the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, and so its
stability is of strategic importance to the United States. And, like its
neighbors, it still has serious economic problems to confront, including
high unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   And the government will still have to deal with tensions between the
majority Shiite Muslim community and the minority ruling Sunnis. So far,
however, leaders of both branches say the new, open approach has helped
keep the peace.</TE>

<HD>Colombian Guerrillas Sound Off</HD>
<DH>S. America: Sharing a televised meeting with several presidential
candidates as part of peace efforts, the rebels decry economic policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>In a bit of high political drama, a handful of Colombia's
presidential candidates faced off Thursday with the nation's largest
rebel group as part of an ongoing effort to rescue the country's peace
process.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting marked the first time that guerrillas from the leftist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, were given a nationally
televised platform to explain their goals and hopes for the process.</LD>
<LD>   They took full advantage of the opportunity, using double their
allotted 15 minutes and launching into a screed against "Yankee"
interference and neoliberal economic policies that showed the yawning
gulf that separates the rebels from the government.</LD>
<TE>   "We must change the neoliberal polices of this government," said FARC
negotiator Simon Trinidad, who met with the candidates and government
negotiators in a special demilitarized zone created three years ago for
peace talks. "They have resulted in the worst economy in the history of
this country."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the charged rhetoric, the meeting also represented a
high-stakes gamble by the candidates, who face a first round of voting in
May.</TE>
<TE>   The peace process has become increasingly unpopular in the last few
months as the guerrillas have gone on a rampage, downing electrical
towers and attacking police and army barracks and, in one case, the water
supply for Bogota, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a huge increase in support for one of the most
conservative candidates in the race, Alvaro Uribe Velez, a tough-talking
former governor who has promised to do away with the demilitarized zone
unless the government wins more concessions from the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   In recent polls, Uribe has advanced from third place to first, winning
53% support in a poll released Thursday--a percentage high enough to
allow him to win the presidency outright May 26. The margin of error was
2 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe skipped the meeting Thursday with the guerrillas, who have
allegedly tried to assassinate him three times, including once with a
bomb strapped to a mule. Several other candidates also avoided the
encounter.</TE>
<TE>   But Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa, who led in earlier polls
and is the candidate most closely identified with the peace process, did
show up.</TE>
<TE>   Serpa sharply confronted the guerrillas, scolding them for failing to
prove their desire for peace. He walked a fine line, talking tough but
continuing to portray himself as the candidate for peace.</TE>
<TE>   But as the rebels and the government negotiators presented their
demands to the nation, the difference between the two positions became
clear.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas laid down a series of conditions to arrive at a
cease-fire before April 7, the deadline imposed by President Andres
Pastrana to invade the zone.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the list includes an end to "Plan Colombia," the
U.S.-backed program to halve Colombia's cocaine production, and a halt to
the extradition of narco-traffickers to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   They also demanded the immediate creation of a massive unemployment
benefit to provide money to the millions of jobless Colombians, a program
they estimated would cost $4 billion a year--or about 5% of the country's
gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the government demanded an end to the rebels' kidnapping
and the release of all captives. It also insisted that the guerrillas
stop destroying infrastructure, laying mines and attacking civilians.</TE>

<LD>The government warned police chiefs that it would intervene if they
failed to halt growing lawlessness on British streets.</LD>
<LD>   Home Secretary David Blunkett said the government would use proposed
new powers to take over local police forces that are losing the
anti-crime battle. London, hit by a wave of muggings and robberies, could
be one of the first forces affected.</LD>
<LD>   Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said
Blunkett was trying to shift blame. The city has 700 fewer officers now
than when Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, and 2,000 fewer than
a decade ago, he said.</LD>

<HD>Democrats Challenge Bush on Weapons Reduction Plan</HD>
<DH>Military: White House's proposal to warehouse nuclear arms, rather
than destroy them, is dangerous and deceptive, senators charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Senate Democrats on Thursday challenged the Bush administration's
new approach to the U.S. nuclear arsenal, arguing that proposed
reductions represent far less change than claimed and could increase the
threat of arms proliferation.</LD>
<LD>   In their first concerted attack on the policy, Democratic lawmakers
charged that plans to warehouse rather than destroy some active warheads
are simply "rearranging the furniture" in the nuclear arsenal. They
disputed the administration's contention that it is moving the United
States away from a nuclear deterrence approach that created a "balance of
terror" during the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   "This is warehoused terror rather than immediate terror," Sen. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.) declared at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush has promoted his team's new vision of nuclear weapons
as one of the major policy innovations of his term. He has announced
plans to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which
barred most strategic anti-missile weapons, and he has declared his
intention to cut the U.S. offensive missile arsenal by two-thirds, to
between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement in November that the United States planned to
decommission thousands of warheads brought wide praise. But the reaction
shifted last month after a report disclosed that the Pentagon intended to
store some of these warheads for possible redeployment rather than
destroy them.</TE>
<TE>   Critics maintain that although warehousing would reduce the threat of
a nuclear conflict, it would not be enough to persuade Russia to continue
to shrink the size of its nuclear arsenal. And they said that if Russia
warehoused a large number of nuclear warheads in unsafe facilities, it
could raise the chance of an accident or the theft of a warhead.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials, who are engaged in intermittent arms talks with the
United States, have insisted that the cuts be irreversible.</TE>
<TE>   Bush officials, however, have maintained that a share of the warheads
must be available for redeployment because of the chance that an
unexpected security threat could suddenly arise. In a long-range report
on the nuclear arsenal released last month, the administration called for
the creation of a "responsive force" including warheads that could be
redeployed on missiles and bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Levin contended that because the administration planned to keep about
the same number of bombers and missiles, and to keep an undisclosed
number of the decommissioned warheads in storage, the nuclear plan wasn't
"exquisitely different," as claimed.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks to me exactly the same," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) said that moving the warheads to
storage was simply "rearranging the furniture."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a reduction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has contended that by ending the old ways of
negotiating arms treaties with the Russians and developing new defensive
and conventional arms, the United States was at last taking steps to end
the deterrent system called "mutually assured destruction," or MAD.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said that the administration still planned
to rely on the threat of retaliatory strikes with nuclear weapons as a
way of deterring adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that it might be dead, yet MAD is still reaching us from the
grave," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith, the Pentagon's top
arms-control official, held his ground, insisting that "we are
drastically reducing our dependence on nuclear arms."</TE>
<TE>   Some outside analysts said pressure from the lawmakers, along with
pressure from the Russians, could influence the outcome of the
U.S.-Russian talks aimed at reaching a new arms agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bush administration wants a deal that won't tie its
hands, it also wants to be able to sign some kind of agreement and has
already made some "modest concessions," said John Isaacs, president of
the Council for a Livable World, an arms-control advocacy group. The
Democrats "do have some ability to shape this agreement," he said.</TE>

<HD>Immunity Ruling Is a Setback to Belgium</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>The International Court of Justice ruled Thursday that government
ministers charged with war crimes can be protected from prosecution by
diplomatic immunity, dealing a major blow to Belgium's attempt to put
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on trial.</LD>
<LD>   An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in Jerusalem said the landmark
ruling supported the Jewish state's position that Belgium's war crimes
proceedings against Sharon should be halted.</LD>
<LD>   "For our part we will continue with our proceedings in the Belgian
court until we persuade it of the justice of our cause," spokeswoman
Yaffa Ben-Ari said.</LD>
<TE>   The Sharon case is based on complaints from survivors of the 1982
massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon was defense minister when hundreds of Palestinian civilians in
the two camps south of Beirut were slaughtered by a Lebanese Christian
militia allied with Israel. An Israeli inquiry into the massacres found
Sharon indirectly responsible, prompting his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal proceedings in Belgium have also been brought against
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, Presidents Fidel Castro of
Cuba, Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Laurent Gbagbo of Ivory Coast, and
former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani.</TE>
<TE>   "Jurisdiction does not imply absence of immunity," said Judge Gilbert
Guillaume, the world court's president.</TE>
<TE>   The International Court of Justice said a foreign minister cannot be
tried in a foreign court because "throughout the duration of his or her
office, [the minister], when abroad, enjoys full immunity from criminal
jurisdiction."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Devadder, a Belgian government lawyer at Thursday's hearing, said
it was up to the Belgian Parliament to amend or repeal the genocide law.</TE>
<TE>   The genocide trials are based on a 1993 law empowering Belgian judges
to hear war crimes and genocide cases regardless of where they occurred
or who committed them.</TE>

<LD>Here are quotes from former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
more than four-hour statement Thursday before the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague:</LD>
<LD>   "This show, which is supposed to take place under the guise of a
trial, is actually a crime against a sovereign state, against the Serb
people, against me. You wish to try me for things carried out in the
capacity of the head of the state in defense of our state and to defend
our people from terrorism and from the greatest military machinery the
world ever had."</LD>
<LD>   "There's not a single element of a fair trial. There's an enormous
apparatus on one side. A vast media structure on that same side. All
kinds of services . . . everything's at your disposal. What's on my side?
I only have a public telephone booth in the prison."</LD>
<TE>   "Your bosses broke up Yugoslavia. They pushed Bosnia into a civil war.
The Serbs did not start the war. It is nonsensical to accuse the wrong
side."</TE>
<TE>   "How do you dare say Kosovo borders with Serbia? Kosovo is Serbia. The
Hague does not 'border' the Netherlands. If you do not know that, someone
can tell you."</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans go to the other side of the globe to fight terrorism,
and that is considered logical and normal. Whereas our struggle against
terrorism in the heart of our own country is considered a crime."</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Suspect Lied, Says Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Authorities accuse detainee of trying to scuttle inquiry.
They're unable to verify claim of U.S. reporter's death.</DH>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Authorities accused the suspected mastermind in the kidnapping of
Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl of trying to derail the
investigation with lies after he stunned a courtroom Thursday by saying
he believed that the journalist was dead.</LD>
<LD>   But in the wake of Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh's bombshell, investigators
here acknowledged that they were still unable to answer key questions,
including whether Pearl is alive, and couldn't say whether they were any
closer to solving his disappearance, now entering its fourth week.</LD>
<LD>   "[Sheikh] is very intelligent, clever and, I would say, experienced in
his own field, and a hard nut to crack," said Syed Kamal Shah, the
inspector general of police in Sindh province, where Karachi is located.</LD>
<TE>   Sheikh's courtroom allegations earlier Thursday contradicted what
authorities say he had told them under questioning. On Tuesday,
investigators said Sheikh had assured them that Pearl was alive. On
Thursday, Shah added that Sheikh said during subsequent interrogation
that he had contacted Pearl's captors and asked them to release him.</TE>
<TE>   As for the new allegation that Pearl was probably dead, Shah said, "We
will believe that statement only if it is substantiated by evidence, and
so far, we have no evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, disappeared Jan. 23 in Karachi en route to a secretive
meeting that he thought would lead him to a reclusive Muslim cleric. Two
e-mails with photographs of Pearl demanded, among other things, the
release of Pakistani prisoners held by the U.S. at its Guantanamo Bay
naval base in Cuba and threatened to execute him within 24 hours. Since
then, there has been no contact with the captors.</TE>
<TE>   The case took a twist during Sheikh's Thursday morning appearance
before a special anti-terrorism court when the suspect tore off the hood
placed over his head and told a judge that "as far as I understand, he
[Pearl] is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh also alleged that he had been detained a full week before his
reported arrest Tuesday and interrupted an explanation of the charges
against him by saying he was guilty and didn't want to defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I kidnapped him," the bespectacled Sheikh said in a soft voice.
"Right or wrong, I had my reasons. I think that our country shouldn't be
catering to America's needs."</TE>
<TE>   In a suggestive answer to a question about whether he had been beaten
by local police, Sheikh said, "They are better than others," and
requested a medical examination by a neutral physician. Observers in the
courtroom said he appeared to be bruised.</TE>
<TE>   The judge ordered Sheikh held until a Feb. 25 court date.</TE>
<TE>   Government sources in Islamabad, the capital, acknowledged that Sheikh
had been in custody earlier than authorities reported but they wouldn't
clarify the duration or circumstances. In addition, the sources said,
Sheikh surrendered and wasn't nabbed in a stakeout, as Shah's agency had
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Confronted with the contradictions, Shah said, "As inspector general,
I am not interested in how he was picked up."</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights attorney Ansar Burney alleged that Sheikh's appearance
had been delayed so it would not embarrass Pakistani President Gen.
Pervez Musharraf during his meeting with President Bush on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Burney said he will file a protest that authorities violated a rule
requiring that suspects go before a judge within 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he repeatedly expressed satisfaction with the pace and
progress of the investigation, Shah acknowledged during his first public
briefing on the case that "it could take a little longer than we
anticipate or we expect" to solve the case.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say at this point is it will not be more than a couple of
days," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shah, nonetheless, was disappointed at what he termed a difficult
interrogation of Sheikh, a 27-year-old British citizen who had earlier
been imprisoned for his role in kidnapping foreign tourists in the
Indian-controlled part of the disputed Kashmir region.</TE>
<TE>   "He is cool but intelligent, and he is at times quite evasive," Shah
said. "He is the type of person who can evade questions in interrogation
for quite some time."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Sheikh had been beaten, Shah assured, "We have not
applied any physical force as yet."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Wall Street Journal said the paper remained
confident that Pearl was alive. His wife, Mariane, who is six months
pregnant, again pleaded for Pearl's release in a written statement: "Our
child is a living soul, nafs al-ru [the same soul as myself]. Since his
father's disappearance, he is now breathing into his being the worry and
apprehension I have about my husband's well-being.</TE>
<TE>   "I have faith you will trust the sincerity of my message to you as a
wife and expectant mother, and that you will let him go free to join me."</TE>

<HD>Russia Warns U.S. on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A preemptive strike against Baghdad could undermine the
global coalition against terrorism, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Russian officials from President Vladimir V. Putin down made clear
Thursday Russia's strong opposition to any U.S. military action against
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Putin said Iraq is not among the countries that supported the Taliban
in Afghanistan, so there is no cause for a U.S. military strike. And
Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov warned that an attack on Iraq
could undermine the global coalition against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Their comments came after President Bush indicated Wednesday that he
will not rule out a preemptive strike to oust Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   Russia has been cultivating relations with all three nations named by
Bush last month as an "axis of evil": Iran, Iraq and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   At a Kremlin news conference Thursday, Putin said Russia knows which
countries supported the Taliban in Afghanistan and "Iraq is not on this
list." But he acknowledged that the international community has problems
with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We are actively discussing these issues together with our partners in
the United Nations and U.N. Security Council, and searching for ways to
solve these problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq expelled U.N. weapons inspectors in 1998, raising suspicions that
it is trying to rebuild weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first victims in any strike against Iraq could be the
relationship between Moscow and Washington, which warmed in the wake of
Russia's wholehearted support for the U.S. war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov said Thursday that the anti-terror campaign must be founded on
sound legal principles and that branding countries an "axis of evil" is
inappropriate. He also said that any U.S. military strike must be
approved by the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri Rogozin, chairman of the State Duma's international affairs
committee, said in a phone interview with The Times that Russia has been
pressuring Iraq to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that Iraq is really overdoing it, refusing to substantially
change its inflexible policy toward the prospects of cooperation with the
U.N.," he said. But he added that there is no evidence of Iraq's
involvement in terrorism against the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that peaceful methods of pressure on Iraq are far from being
exhausted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogozin also said Iraqi opposition groups are not as organized as
Afghanistan's anti-Taliban Northern Alliance was, suggesting that any
U.S. military action would require a major ground operation.</TE>
<TE>   "In Iraq, the USA won't achieve much by just throwing darts around.
They will have to shed a lot of blood before they realize that Saddam
Hussein has escaped and is safely hidden somewhere where they can't reach
him," Rogozin said.</TE>
<TE>   The hail of Russian opposition Thursday to the prospect of U.S. action
against Iraq came even from members of Yabloko, a liberal party.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir P. Lukin, a former ambassador to the U.S. and leading Yabloko
member, said U.S. military action against Iraq would be opposed almost
unanimously around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States does not like the regime of Saddam Hussein and
wants to have it overthrown by force, that is a violation of
international norms because no evidence has been given of Hussein's
relationship with international terrorism and the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks," Lukin said.</TE>

<HD>Suspicion of Murder Adds to Terror Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials question the fiery death of a woman set to testify
in a fraud proceeding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Investigators probing possible terrorist connections in Memphis,
Tenn., have concluded that a woman charged with helping five Middle
Eastern men get fake licenses was probably murdered when her car burst
into flames along a rural highway, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Even as officials in Washington announced that six suspected Al Qaeda
associates were in custody overseas, the dramatic developments in
Tennessee fueled new questions about possible terrorist links within the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   Forensic tests in the Memphis case revealed gasoline on the clothing
of Katherine Smith, 49, and on the passenger side of her car, which ran
off the road early Sunday and hit a light pole, said Phil Thomas, special
agent in charge of the Memphis office of the FBI.</LD>
<TE>   Smith, who was burned beyond recognition, had been due to appear in
federal court the next day in a detention hearing for five co-defendants
in a fraud case. A driver's license examiner for the state of Tennessee,
she had allegedly helped the five obtain fake driver's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's suspicious death comes amid an investigation by the FBI into
whether her five co-defendants may have "connections" to terrorism.
Authorities say one of the five drove from New York City to Memphis on
Sept. 11, while a second man had in his wallet a temporary pass from the
World Trade Center dated Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to say what their tie-ins may or may not be," Thomas
said in an interview. "But we're checking their names and their
pedigrees" against databases on terrorism suspects to determine if there
are any matches.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys insist that the five are being linked to terrorism
only because they are Middle Eastern, and they point out that the
men--who remain in custody in Memphis--were locked up when Smith was
killed and could not have been involved.</TE>
<TE>   It is now clear, however, that Smith was not killed in an auto
accident, Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of suicide, Thomas
said, but he acknowledged that the manner in which Smith died would be an
unusual method to take one's life.</TE>
<TE>   The more likely scenario, he said, is murder.</TE>
<TE>   "It is suspicious, due to the physical evidence of the car," Thomas
said. "This is not your usual accident. We've had several fire marshals
come in and say the burn pattern looks more like an arson."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say that the fuel tank of the car did not explode, and
the 1992 Acura Legend suffered only minimal damage when it ran into a
ditch and hit the light pole about 12:45 a.m. Sunday on U.S. 72 in
Fayette County. Several eyewitnesses indicated that the car was already
in flames when it ran off the road.</TE>
<TE>   There are no immediate suspects, Thomas said, but "we're pursuing all
investigative leads."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, authorities in Washington narrowed the pool of suspects
wanted in connection with an urgent warning about possible attacks
against Americans, perhaps in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI late Monday issued an urgent alert to 18,000 law enforcement
agencies nationwide, warning them to be on the lookout for Yemeni
national Fawaz Yahya Al-Rabeei and 16 associates who may have been
planning terrorist attacks this week.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the agency said that six of the associates whose photos
were released "have been located overseas." Law enforcement officials who
asked not to be identified said that all six were taken into custody in
Yemen before Monday's warning.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said that putting out alerts about suspects who, it
turned out, were already in custody represented not an intelligence
failure but rather an "abundance of caution."</TE>
<TE>   "These guys use many aliases, and it was just a matter of tracking
them down and getting out all the information that we could as quickly as
we could," one official said.</TE>
<TE>   Because there was the possibility of an attack within 24 hours of
Monday night's warning, another official said, "we didn't want to wait to
confirm their identities."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Official Is Slain at Airport</HD>
<DH>Violence: Mecca-bound pilgrims angered by flight delays attacked
and killed Transportation Minister Abdul Rahman, government confirms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A mob of Muslim pilgrims, angered by two-day flight delays,
attacked and killed Afghanistan's interim transportation minister at the
airport here Thursday, an Interior Ministry spokesman said today.</LD>
<LD>   Air Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdul Rahman had gone to the
airport to catch a flight when he was attacked by a large number of
pilgrims who were waiting to fly to Mecca, the Saudi holy city, said the
spokesman, Faraidoon, who spoke to Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   The incident was first reported on Qatar-based Al Jazeera television.
It could not be confirmed Thursday night in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital,
because telephones to police and ministries do not function and a curfew
forbids civilians to be on the street after 10 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Faraidoon, who uses only one name, confirmed the report this morning.</TE>
<TE>   The incident deals yet another blow to the fledgling administration of
interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, which is attempting to restore law
and order to Afghanistan after more than two decades of war. Most recent
killings here have occurred during fighting between rival ethnic groups
or in clashes between soldiers loyal to competing warlords.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to Kabul's airport earlier Thursday to investigate why the
facility seemed unusually busy found hundreds of pilgrims, clad in thin
white robes and sandals, standing near the runway. One pilgrim, a senior
official in the Interior Ministry, said he had paid $1,400 to fly to
Mecca and had been waiting two days to get on the flight.</TE>
<TE>   The hajj to Mecca, the birthplace of the prophet Muhammad and Islam's
holiest city, is one of the pillars of the Muslim faith. Muslims who are
financially and physically able are obliged to make the pilgrimage at
least once.</TE>
<TE>   Although the pilgrims at the airport seemed perturbed, they did not
appear hostile. Nevertheless, a guard shooed a foreign reporter away from
the crowds, citing "security" reasons.</TE>
<TE>   At least one plane from Afghanistan's national airline, Ariana, sat on
the edge of the runway with many would-be passengers milling around it.
It wasn't clear why it was sidelined. There are only three scheduled
flights from Kabul a week, to two cities within Afghanistan, and they are
often canceled because of bad weather, lack of passengers or mechanical
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Ariana made its first international flight in three years,
to New Delhi, after the United Nations lifted a ban imposed as part of
sanctions against the Taliban regime. Al Jazeera said foreign aircraft
were being leased to ferry 5,000 pilgrims to Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   Although the airport wasn't flying out pilgrims, it was busy with
other matters. Numerous military helicopters and transport planes took
off and landed throughout the afternoon. At least one giant Antonov cargo
plane took off. Several nearby roads were blocked off. A woman who had
been scheduled to fly on a United Nations flight earlier Thursday said it
had been canceled because airspace couldn't be secured.</TE>
<TE>   A police officer said some of the planes were transporting equipment
for the international peacekeeping force. Soldiers from several nations
are arriving to bring the force up to its planned strength of 5,000. They
will help keep order in Kabul's streets.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. has declined to participate in the peacekeeping
force, it seems to be establishing more of a presence in Kabul. Special
Forces soldiers in plain clothes have been spotted more frequently around
the city in recent days. The Ariana Hotel in the city center has been
fortified with sandbags and concealed with draperies, and it is rumored
to be the new home of some U.S. troops. The soldiers would not discuss
their mission.</TE>

<HD>Attack on Afghan Base Injured 2 U.S. Soldiers, Army Reports</HD>
<DH>Military: The apparently well-organized gunmen came within 50 yards
of the airfield in Kandahar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Gunmen came within 50 yards of U.S. positions on the main American
base in southern Afghanistan in an apparently well-organized attack that
left two soldiers slightly injured, an Army spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The attack Wednesday night sparked a 15-to-20-minute firefight, with
U.S. troops shooting back with machine guns, dispatching helicopter
gunships and sending up flares. It was the most intense attack on the
heavily guarded airfield at Kandahar since Jan. 10, when gunmen opened
fire as a transport plane carrying 20 Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners took
off for the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. military had said Wednesday that no casualties occurred and
that the base was not penetrated.</LD>
<TE>   Flares were again fired from U.S. positions in Kandahar late Thursday
after troops spotted a vehicle with three passengers about a mile
southwest of the airfield, Army spokesman Maj. A.C. Roper said. Two other
people were seen near the vehicle. One flare started a large fire near
the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody was caught, and no shots were fired," Roper said. "I can't say
there is any connection between the vehicles seen tonight and the ones
observed yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   The two soldiers slightly injured Wednesday were back on duty
Thursday, said Maj. Ralph Mills, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command
in Tampa, Fla. One suffered a slight wound to a hand, and the other was
grazed in the neck by a bullet, Mills said.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Tony Rivers, quoting troops on forward positions, said the
attackers came within 50 yards of the U.S. defense lines "and appeared
well organized."</TE>
<TE>   The identity and number of attackers were unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The base houses more than 4,100 troops and a detention facility for Al
Qaeda and Taliban prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, the Defense Department identified a U.S. soldier who
was killed Wednesday at another airfield. Army Spc. Jason A. Disney, 21,
of Fallon, Nev., died shortly after a piece of heavy equipment fell on
him at the Bagram air base, north of Kabul. He was assigned to the 7th
Transportation Battalion at Ft. Bragg, N.C.</TE>

<HD>Congress Plans Investigation Into Sept. 11 Intelligence Failures</HD>
<DH>Attacks: House-Senate inquiry will also examine spy agencies'
anti-terror efforts dating to 1985.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees formally
announced plans Thursday to conduct a joint inquiry of the intelligence
failures surrounding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The lawmakers tapped L. Britt Snider, former inspector general at the
CIA and onetime aide to CIA Director George J. Tenet, to oversee a staff
of investigators who will spend much of the next year, if not longer,
investigating what went wrong and why.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said that the bicameral arrangement is unprecedented and that
the scope of the inquiry will be extensive, with plans to examine the
intelligence community's response to terrorist threats dating back to the
1980s.</LD>
<TE>   The joint committee will spend the next few months gathering documents
from agencies and testimony from intelligence officials, with public
hearings possible as early as April, Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of this inquiry is to ascertain why the intelligence
community did not learn of the Sept. 11 attacks in advance," Graham said.
"We owe this to the 3,000 who died, their families and the rest of
America."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement marks the official opening of an inquiry that
lawmakers began discussing almost immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks
but were reluctant to begin in the midst of the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Snider, who retired from the CIA last year, is a veteran of
intelligence investigations dating back to the landmark Church Committee
hearings in the 1970s that probed CIA spying on American citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Critics complained that Snider is too close to Tenet to be objective.
Snider previously served as special counsel to Tenet at the CIA and was
general counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee when Tenet was its
staff director in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Snider's selection "sets the stage for a whitewash," warned the Center
for Security Policy, a right-wing organization run by Frank J. Gaffney, a
Pentagon official during the Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the
intelligence committee, said he and others had raised questions about
Snider's selection but ultimately agreed with his appointment.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was announced by the ranking members of the
intelligence panels in both chambers, including Graham and Shelby in the
Senate and Reps. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.) and Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) in the House.</TE>
<TE>   Though Sept. 11 will be the focus of the investigation, lawmakers said
they plan to examine the intelligence community's anti-terrorism efforts
dating back to 1985, when the CIA created its counter-terrorism center.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the United States has been the target of a series of
deadly terrorist attacks carried out by Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
organization, including bombings of the World Trade Center in 1993, U.S.
embassies in East Africa in 1998 and the destroyer Cole in Yemen in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has voiced concern in recent weeks that the probe
could become a distraction for intelligence officials at a time when they
are managing a global effort to combat terrorism. But Graham and Goss
said that the Bush administration has pledged full cooperation with the
inquiry and that there are no constraints on its scope or direction.</TE>
<TE>   The basic components of the joint committee are only beginning to take
shape. Graham and Goss recently requested $2.6 million in funding, enough
to pay for roughly 24 staff members through the beginning of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from naming Snider, lawmakers said they have made no other
hires, let alone begun drafting requests for evidence or plotting out
schedules for hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said the committee will seek to hold its hearings in public
when possible but acknowledged that many will have to be conducted in
closed session and that the panel expects to issue classified and
unclassified versions of its final report.</TE>
<TE>   Some procedural details remain unresolved, including how Graham and
Goss--Florida lawmakers from opposing parties--will divide their duties
as co-chairmen.</TE>
<TE>   In Snider, the lawmakers have turned to an experienced hand. He has
played significant roles in high-profile intelligence inquiries,
including the Iran-Contra investigation of the 1980s and the Senate probe
of CIA turncoat Aldrich H. Ames in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But the stakes of the Sept. 11 inquiry could prove considerably
higher. Goss and other lawmakers say the outcome could influence the
shape of the intelligence community for a generation and compare its
significance to investigations of Pearl Harbor that led to the creation
of the CIA in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Snider, who did not respond to a request for an interview, could face
a delicate task managing the demands of committee members who have
conflicting ideas over how aggressively the investigation should be
conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Goss and Graham, for example, have stressed that they want to avoid
assigning blame for the Sept. 11 attacks. But Shelby, a frequent critic
of Tenet, has argued that the committee should be prepared to hold
officials accountable if evidence shows that they could or should have
done more.</TE>

<HD>New Security Rules for Nuclear Plants</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Plan calls for improved screening of workers, guard
training, stricter vehicle searches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government Thursday ordered the nation's 103 nuclear power
plants to adopt more rigorous employee screening and guard training as
part of an anti-terrorism campaign, but critics said the measures did not
go far enough to protect dangerous radioactive material.</LD>
<LD>   The stricter security also means that cars and trucks approaching
commercial nuclear plants will be stopped farther away from plant gates
for searches, the Nuclear Regulatory Agency said.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the stepped-up security, plant employees will be subject to
new restrictions as to where they can go within a facility. There also
will be more screening and identification checks for employees and
subcontractors visiting plants.</LD>
<TE>   Nuclear safety activists and some Democratic lawmakers have called for
National Guard troops or federalized guards to help prevent attacks
against the facilities.</TE>
<TE>   They say the plants, even with concrete walls more than 4 feet thick,
would be vulnerable to strikes like those on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon on Sept. 11 by fuel-laden hijacked jets.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns also have been raised about potential bomb-laden boats
because most plants are built near rivers, oceans and lakes for the vast
amounts of water needed to cool their reactors. The Coast Guard has
imposed nearly 100 off-limit zones near nuclear plants; boaters who enter
the areas face fines of $5,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration has banned flights within 12 miles
of most such plants.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear plants, which supply one-fifth of U.S. electricity, long have
been required to have armed guards, razor wire or fences and monitoring
devices. The plants also are required to hold drills every few years to
demonstrate that they can ward off heavily armed paramilitary forces
intent on sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush said last month that diagrams of nuclear power plants
were discovered in Al Qaeda hide-outs in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) called the new security measures "too
little, too late and too temporary."</TE>
<TE>   "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is still operating in a pre-Sept.
11 world," said Markey, a longtime critic of the nuclear industry. "We
know all too well that the terrorists of Al Qaeda have contemplated and
would carry out an attack on a nuclear facility."</TE>
<TE>   The nuclear industry, which opposes federalization of guards, said the
new security measures merely fine-tune already elaborate procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Plants in the U.S. employ about 5,000 guards, with an average of 80
per plant, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear plant guards must pass an FBI background check and
psychological tests, then train about 300 hours before beginning work.
Each guard receives 30 more hours of training annually.</TE>
<TE>   All 103 U.S. plants went on high alert after the Sept. 11 attacks in
New York and near Washington; more than 3,000 people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators declined to elaborate on the new security measures, saying
that details could not be made public. They also insisted that the
requirements were not in response to any specific threat against a plant.</TE>
<TE>   "We took steps immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks to raise the
security level of all the nuclear plants and have issued more than 20
advisories to the plants since then recommending ways they can further
strengthen security," said Victor Dricks, an agency spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Convicted of Lying About Knowing Hijacker</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>A Saudi man was convicted Thursday of lying to the FBI when he
denied knowing one of the Sept. 11 hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   Faisal Al Salmi repeatedly denied knowing Hani Hanjour, one of the
terrorists aboard the plane that hit the Pentagon, during a series of
interviews on Sept. 18 and Sept. 19, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Al Salmi, 34, was the first person convicted on charges connecting him
to the hijackers. He was not charged with terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Al Salmi, who came to the United States from Saudi Arabia on a student
visa in 1997, could receive up to six months behind bars when he is
sentenced April 29. Al Salmi has been in custody since Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Al Salmi and Hanjour were registered at the same time
to use a flight simulator that was open to the public at a Phoenix flight
school.</TE>
<TE>   Several FBI agents testified during Al Salmi's trial that he had
changed his story during the interviews, eventually acknowledging he had
met Hanjour on different occasions.</TE>
<TE>   During closing arguments Thursday, Sexton said Al Salmi was even
deceptive when he eventually acknowledged meeting Hanjour.</TE>
<TE>   Al Salmi told authorities he met Hanjour twice at a Phoenix area
mosque. But the two were also seen together at a store in suburban
Scottsdale last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Al Salmi's attorney, Gerald Williams, didn't deny his client and
Hanjour had met, but told jurors there was a difference between meeting
people and knowing them.</TE>

<HD>15 Airports Named in 1st Phase of Federal Security Takeover</HD>
<DH>Travel: By Nov. 19, all facilities will have government employees
screening passengers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The new federal office in charge of airline security announced
Thursday that 15 airports will be the first group to have government
employees conduct passenger and baggage screening.</LD>
<LD>   The 15 airports--including Atlanta, Baltimore-Washington, Boston,
O'Hare in Chicago and Kennedy in New York--are being studied by the new
Transportation Security Administration as it prepares to replace the
private companies now handling security.</LD>
<LD>   By Nov. 19, passengers at all 429 commercial airports in the U.S. are
to be screened by a higher-paid, better-trained federal work force.</LD>
<TE>   These steps were outlined as the new agency prepared to assume
responsibility Sunday for protecting airline passengers. Under the
airline security law enacted after Sept. 11, the agency will displace the
airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Airline officials said a federal takeover of security was long
overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "When was the last time you heard anyone clamoring for private
companies to perform customs or immigration functions?" asked Michael
Wascom, a spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., the trade group for the
major airlines. "Law enforcement and national security are federal
government responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   John Magaw, undersecretary for transportation security, said federal
security officials would be in place Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Those supervisors will remain on the job until the agency hires
federal security directors for each airport, Magaw said. The directors,
who must be U.S. citizens, will be paid between $104,800 and $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Magaw said he was hiring an ombudsman to handle complaints from
passengers and others. There have been several complaints about security
screeners patting down passengers of the opposite sex.</TE>
<TE>   "There are proper ways to search," Magaw said.</TE>
<TE>   The other 10 airports that will be the first to get federal security
screeners are Anchorage; Charlotte, N.C.; Dallas-Fort Worth; Grand
Rapids, Mich.; Louisville, Ky.; Minneapolis; Mobile, Ala.; Orlando, Fla.;
San Francisco; and Spokane, Wash.</TE>

<HD>Cartoonist 'Sorry' for Drawing Based on Trade Center Attacks</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CONCORD, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>Concord Monitor cartoonist Mike Marland apologized Thursday for
publishing a drawing of a plane labeled "Bush Budget" crashing into two
towers labeled "Social Security."</LD>
<LD>   "It was not my intention to desecrate the memory of those who died
that day, nor to add to the anguish and sorrow of their loved ones or the
city of New York," Marland wrote on the paper's opinion page Thursday.
"To these people, all I can say is how profoundly sorry I am."</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of readers and public officials criticized the Feb. 8
cartoon, saying it was insensitive to those still suffering from the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   "Equating the president's budget with terrorist attacks that took
3,000 lives is as wrong as wrong can be," White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said after the cartoon appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Marland said the drawing was meant to illustrate the potential
calamity of Bush's proposal to tap into the Social Security surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Marland wrote that he should have listened to his wife. "She was the
first to tell me that maybe that Bush-Social Security cartoon wasn't such
a good idea."</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terrorism Camera Plan Raising Eyebrows in Capital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The specter of Big Brother loomed over the U.S. capital as police
said Thursday that they plan to create a network of public surveillance
cameras to help fight terrorism as well as assist other law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   Washington Deputy Police Chief Terry Gainer said linking an estimated
200 existing cameras around schools, the subway, businesses and
government agencies would help the force beef up security in the wake of
the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   But local media reports about the plans sparked outrage among privacy
advocates who predicted a nightmare straight out of George Orwell's
classic novel "1984" about the evils of a totalitarian state.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to use all the technology we can within the law to maximize
our effectiveness, and that includes cameras," Gainer said, adding that
Washington police had started using cameras for traffic and crowd control
18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of scrutiny probably spooks people a little bit," he said,
adding that the force welcomes suggestions on anti-abuse controls and is
canvassing neighborhoods and businesses to gauge support for camera
monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   "To expose ordinary citizens, who have an expectation of some privacy
when they visit our monuments, to the peering of the police department is
not unlike those nations that we condemn for monitoring the movements of
their citizens," said Johnny Barnes, head of the local chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union.</TE>
<TE>   The surveillance would parallel on a smaller scale the intensive
closed-circuit television monitoring system used by British police. From
1 million to 2 million cameras are estimated to cover British public
areas. Despite privacy concerns, British police have credited the system
with reducing crime and helping them solve tough cases.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A jailed Muslim cleric sued the federal government Thursday,
challenging the way closed-door immigration hearings have been held since
the Sept. 11 attacks on America.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was filed on behalf of Rabih Haddad, a native of Lebanon who
was arrested at his Ann Arbor, Mich., home Dec. 14.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest came on the same day that federal agents, invoking a
recently enacted anti-terrorism law, raided the offices and froze the
assets of the Global Relief Foundation, a prominent Illinois-based
U.S.-Islamic relief group that Haddad co-founded. U.S. officials blame
Islamic militant Osama bin Laden for masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks
that killed about 3,000 people.</LD>
<TE>   Haddad is a board member of Global Relief Foundation, which sued
several news organizations in November, claiming it had been defamed by
reports alleging it had links to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   He has had three secret hearings in immigration court in Detroit since
he was detained.</TE>

<LD>A study by the Environmental Protection Agency has confirmed what
Columbia Basin Indians have long suspected: The fish they depend on for
food are still contaminated by pesticides and industrial pollutants.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioned by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the
study figured that Indians, who are likely to eat fish they catch in the
basin 48 times a month, would be 50 times more likely to get cancer after
70 years than members of the general public who eat those fish once a

Army plans to begin destroying nerve agents later this year.</LD>
<LD>   Siegelman said the government has reneged on an agreement to spend
$40.5 million for gas masks and other safety precautions for people who
live near the Anniston Army Depot, about 60 miles east of Birmingham.</LD>
<LD>   Siegelman asked a court to block any burning at the $1-billion
incinerator until the government provides the "maximum protection"

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trial of three prison guards accused of fatally beating a death
row inmate neared conclusion as closing arguments were presented.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys told the jury in Starke that inmates who testified
against the guards were offered special treatment or coerced, and
shouldn't be trusted.</LD>
<LD>   But prosecutors said the inmates' testimony and testimony from medical
experts and other witnesses should be enough to convict Timothy Thornton,
36; Charles Brown, 28; and Jason Griffis, 28.</LD>
<TE>   The guards face life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder in
the July 1999 beating death of Frank Valdes, who was on death row for
killing a guard while trying to free another inmate in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say guards attacked Valdes to stop him from contacting
reporters about inmate abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The guards told investigators Valdes fatally injured himself by diving
onto the concrete floor or that he may have been killed by five other
guards set to be tried later.</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks to Curb Power Plant Emissions, Sets Climate Goals</HD>
<DH>Environment: Program would offer incentives to firms to cut 3
pollutants. Critics say proposals fall short of current rules and
president's promises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush asked Congress on Thursday to set new limits on
three pollutants spewed by power plants and to create a trading system
that would give the utilities financial incentives to reduce emissions.</LD>
<LD>   The president also outlined a new policy to tackle global warming by
using voluntary incentives and tax breaks to slow the growth rate of
greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   Bush says his "cap-and-trade" power plant initiative would cut
acid-rain-producing sulfur dioxide by 73% and smog-producing nitrogen
oxide by 67% by 2018. It would also reduce emissions of mercury, which
can delay mental and physical development in children, by 69% over the
same period, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "This legislation will constitute the most significant step America
has ever taken . . . to cut power plant emissions that contribute to
urban smog, acid rain and numerous health problems for our citizens,"
Bush said in an address at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists took issue with the president's assessment of his
proposals, saying that the distant deadlines set by his power plant plan
would delay reductions in pollution levels already required by current
clean air law.</TE>
<TE>   They also complained that under his strategy America would continue to
increase emissions of carbon dioxide while the rest of the developed
world struggles to cut emissions below 1990 levels. Many scientists
believe that carbon dioxide is a leading contributor to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   The president's power plant bill is modeled on the successful acid
rain control program created by the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, which
rely on a cap-and-trade system to obtain deep cuts in emissions of sulfur
dioxide by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Under the programs, power plants are given pollution allowances, or
credits, which they can trade with each other for money. A portion of the
credits is retired over time, making it increasingly more expensive to
pollute and spurring companies to reduce emissions.</TE>
<TE>   The president's climate-change proposal placed the United States out
of sync with the rest of the developed world, which has adopted the Kyoto
Protocol, a 1997 agreement reached at a meeting in Kyoto, Japan, that
seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 by an average of 5.2%
below 1990 levels.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's announcement is expected to be received coolly abroad, where
leaders in Europe and Japan have expressed displeasure with the
president's decision last spring to walk away from the Kyoto accord.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush argued that cutting greenhouse gases would deeply damage the
American economy.</TE>
<TE>   "As president of the United States, charged with safeguarding the
welfare of the American people and American workers, I will not commit
our nation to an unsound international treaty that will throw millions of
our citizens out of work," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists countered that it is possible to cut emissions
without hurting the economy. They said Britain and Germany have reduced
greenhouse gases below 1990 levels by 10% and 8%, respectively, while
maintaining economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's speech, the president outlined ways he hopes to prod the
country and the developing world to voluntarily limit the increases in
the level of greenhouse gases. His plan seeks $555 million from Congress
next year, as part of $4.6 billion over five years, for tax credits to
spur investments in solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. One
proposal would provide tax credits of up to $4,000 to people who buy new
gasoline-electric hybrid cars and small trucks and up to $8,000 to people
who buy fuel-cell vehicles from 2002 to 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Carbon dioxide is produced by burning petroleum, coal and other fossil
fuels. If the nation relied more heavily on renewable energy sources,
which do not create carbon dioxide, it could limit its greenhouse gas
emissions.</TE>
<TE>   The president also asked Congress to increase funding for climate
science research and challenged businesses to make specific commitments
to restrain emissions of carbon dioxide.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and some members of Congress said the president
passed up opportunities for making significant dents in U.S. carbon
dioxide emissions by not calling for mandatory reductions of emissions,
tough fuel efficiency standards in cars or proposals to regulate carbon
dioxide emissions from power plants, as he had promised in his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate committee
drafting legislation to cut pollutants from power plants, said the
president's plan is like a "three-legged horse," because it does not
regulate carbon dioxide emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Market-driven strategies have gained great favor in recent years as an
alternative to regulation by government edict, although some programs
around the nation have run into problems. Pollution trading schemes in
Los Angeles, New Jersey and Michigan have failed to deliver reductions as
promised, and have drawn fire from environmentalists, auditors and
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   The president said that expanding the cap-and-trade program for sulfur
dioxide and creating similar programs for nitrogen oxide and mercury will
harness the power of the market to reduce pollution faster than through
regulations. It will also avoid the years of delay caused when companies
sue the government over regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "This will get substantially greater reductions than the current Clean
Air Act over 10 years," said Jeffrey Holmstead, head of the Environmental
Protection Agency's air office. "I understand there are people out there
saying this is a ruse to gut the Clean Air Act. That's just not true."</TE>
<TE>   Holmstead said he was optimistic that Congress would embrace this
approach to controlling pollutants from power plants either this year or
next year.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists warned that the caps envisioned by the
administration are not tough enough, nor are the deadlines soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Delaying cleanup of these plants will cause more asthma attacks and
more cardiopulmonary disease for thousands of Americans," said David
Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "And we will see many
more premature deaths."</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists argued that the cap-and-trade system may not go
far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "He is essentially asking us to buy a Ferrari but telling us not to
drive it faster than 50 mph," said Joseph Goffman, senior attorney for
Environmental Defense.</TE>
<TE>   Even some members of Bush's party in Congress agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned that the deadlines and caps in the president's
proposal may not go far enough beyond those in current law," said Rep.
Sherwood L. Boehlert (R-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Boehlert predicted that the president's power plant
proposal will break the deadlocked debate in Congress on clean air.</TE>

<HD>$10 for a Beer? Welcome to Salt Lake</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Businesses hoping to make many a quick buck greet
visitors with inflated prices. But some, citing ethics, refuse to take
advantage.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Barely audible above the lunch-rush din at Caputo's Market and
Deli, Sue Pace was adamant. "It's all about greed," she said, shaking her
head. "We didn't even think about it, not once."</LD>
<LD>   The source of Pace's consternation: rampant price gouging during the
Olympics at restaurants, hotels and parking lots. By some accounts, a
good number of Pace's competitors have raised prices by 20% since the
Winter Games began last week. Some have introduced "Olympic menus,"
featuring higher prices and fewer choices. Most have instituted an
automatic 18% gratuity.</LD>
<LD>   Price hikes are a predictable business response to the hundreds of
thousands of people here for the Games--10,000 journalists and more than
150,000 visitors daily--driven by the law of supply. Fans at the Olympic
venues are also a captive audience, evidently willing to pay $4 for a
small bottle of water.</LD>
<TE>   Elsewhere around here, business owners face a tantalizing proposition:
the possibility of making a year's worth of profit in two weeks by
raising prices to out-of-towners they may never see again.</TE>
<TE>   Many succumb to the lure of profits, but other business owners here
have taken a different view, refusing to hike prices or, in some cases,
offering a 15% discount to anyone showing a Utah driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the visitors to come, but we also want our regulars to feel
we haven't abandoned them," Pace said, gesturing around her teeming
store. "You will all leave town after the Games, and we will rely on our
regular customers for our business. I think it's simply wrong to raise
prices for two weeks, only to lower them later."</TE>
<TE>   At the Market Street Grill, manager Will Keesen said the restaurant is
adding an 18% tip to every check because tipping is not a universal
custom. Some menus have a round red sticker informing diners of the new
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Keesen said, prices are unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in business for 20 years," he said. "I think it would be
pretty shortsighted to do something like that, even though I know our
competitors are doing it."</TE>
<TE>   They are doing it with great gusto. Take the "Olympic menu," for
example. At least one posh restaurant has adopted a prix fixe menu, $95
for a three-course meal. The offerings are the same that the restaurant
had the week before, just fewer of them and at a higher price.</TE>
<TE>   Media members and others with readily identified laminated badges are
easy targets for scammers. Todd Panagopoulos, a Chicago Tribune
photographer, said he and a group went to dinner this week and
encountered a $10 bottle of beer and a $6.50 piece of sushi.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel rooms are at a premium, and even modest rooms are garnering
four-star rates. As the Games began, most of the 32,000 hotel, motel,
condominium and bed-and-breakfast rooms within a two-hour drive of Salt
Lake City were booked, according to the Utah Hotel and Lodging Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Market forces allow the dowdy $79-a-night hotel across from the main
press center here to quadruple its rates. And it's full of grateful
guests.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some fleabag hotels solicit people from out of state and
lead them to believe that paying $250 a night would be a good deal," said
Michael DeGroote of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce. "Unfortunately,
it's a hotel you wouldn't let your dog stay in."</TE>
<TE>   Even parking lots have jacked up prices. Rates range from $5 a day, a
bargain if you can get it, to $25. The Gateway Center is the most
convenient parking lot for those attending the skating events at the
Delta Center. Normally parking there is free for the first hour. Now the
rate is $5 a day, and patrons are issued a coupon that invites them to
return after the Games and park free.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake residents have been warned for two years to expect this kind
of inflation. But all the warnings in the world haven't prepared them for
Tokyo-type prices overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Stacie Hancock and her group of 20-something friends from Ogden were
put off by $7 beers. "I have to say, beer is way overpriced.
Cocktails--forget it," Hancock said. "It's ridiculous. The whole thing is
kind of bad for locals."</TE>
<TE>   The group decided this would be their first and last foray into
downtown restaurants during the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Price gouging and even ticket scalping are legal here. Although
Georgia enacted laws against price gouging before the 1996 Summer Games
in Atlanta, Utah has not followed suit, preferring to allow businesses to
set their own prices.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic fans seem to have adopted a kind of group shrug about it,
accepting the prices as an expensive lesson in free enterprise. Applying
a moral or ethical code to business practice offers no simple answers.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn McKay, a professor of business ethics at the University of Utah,
offers a seasoned perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Our private enterprise engine is fired by personal greed," he said.
"My thesis in studying human behavior is that all behavior is motivated
by self-interest. To live by the golden rule puts you at a disadvantage
in the business world. What's happening here is normal, unconscionable
and the way of the world. All we have is the 'everyone else is doing it'
defense."</TE>

<DL>GREENVILLE, S.C.
</DL>
<LD>Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian school that
banned interracial dating until two years ago, is recruiting minorities
in hopes of shaking its racist image.</LD>
<LD>   More than 40 minority students have applied for aid through two new
funds that are sponsored by private donations, and nine have won
scholarships so far, said Dan Hicks, a liaison between the university and
the scholarships' boards.</LD>
<LD>   The university first admitted black students after the Internal
Revenue Service moved to revoke its tax-exempt status in 1970, citing
discrimination. The school said it has few blacks but no precise figures
on its racial makeup.</LD>
<TE>   School spokesman Jonathan Pait said the scholarships reflect a growing
interest by blacks in the 4,200-student school.</TE>
<TE>   "Another reason is that we're so often pointed out as being so
racist," he said. "We wanted to take a stab, at least, to overcome that
stereotype," Pait said.</TE>
<TE>   The school was thrust into the national spotlight when then-Texas Gov.
George W. Bush stopped there during his presidential campaign two years
ago. Bush was criticized for not addressing the school's ban on
interracial dating and statements by Jones that were perceived as
anti-Catholic and anti-Mormon.</TE>

<HD>Indicted Spy Could Face Death on New Charges</HD>
<DH>Court: Brian P. Regan may get tougher sentence in alleged attempt
to sell secrets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury brought new and more serious espionage charges
Thursday against a former Air Force master sergeant who was allegedly
driven by money in his ill-fated quest to pass U.S. secrets to Iraq and
Libya.</LD>
<LD>   Brian P. Regan, who was facing a term of life in prison before
Thursday, could now be sentenced to death if he is convicted on attempted
espionage charges. The 39-year-old Maryland resident, arrested last
summer while trying to board a flight to Europe with secrets in tow,
pleaded not guilty last November and is due to be arraigned today on the
new charges.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities brought the more serious capital charges after uncovering
incriminating letters that the former reconnaissance specialist allegedly
drafted to Iraq and Libya, seeking millions in exchange for U.S. secrets.</LD>
<TE>   Regan was one of three former government employees caught last year in
alleged acts of espionage. Although not nearly as serious as the case
against former FBI agent Robert P. Hanssen--who was convicted of spying
for the Russians for more than two decades--Regan's case has reinforced
troubling concerns about the United States' ability to protect its
secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson said at a news conference that Regan,
a decorated Air Force veteran who went to work for a government
contractor after 20 years in the military, engaged in "a systematic and
calculated plan to damage our country's national security."</TE>
<TE>   The new indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury in Alexandria,
Va., includes page after page of what are described as excerpts from
Regan's secret letters.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment charges Regan only with "attempted espionage," and
Thompson and other federal officials refused to say whether he ever
actually sent the letters or successfully passed classified information
to foreign powers.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter laden with misspellings that Regan allegedly drafted to
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, the Air Force veteran complained that
athletes and movie stars in the United States receive "tens of millions
of dollars a year for their trivial" work.</TE>
<TE>   Married with four children, Regan went on: "If I am going to risk my
life and the future of my family I am going to get paid a fair price,"
according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said he wanted $13 million from the Iraqis in exchange for
a secret manual on U.S. reconnaissance and collection systems, along with
other intelligence. He promised in the letter that the Iraqis would be
getting vital information the United States has spent billions of dollars
to develop in acquiring intelligence on other nations.</TE>
<TE>   As a "bonus," Regan wanted to give Iraq information on their chief
adversaries in Iran, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Regan allegedly worked out an intricate system for delivering the
information to maintain his anonymity, including encrypted letters,
hidden messages in the Washington Post's classified section and secret
bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Regan also allegedly drafted a similar letter to Libyan President
Moammar Kadafi, offering to sell a secret study on Libyan air defense and
classified intelligence on satellites, early warning systems, defense
against large-scale attacks and other national security issues.</TE>
<TE>   As in the Iraqi letter, Regan warned the Libyans that they would be
losing a "great opportunity" if his safety and security should be
compromised in any way.</TE>
<TE>   While it is not clear if Regan actually passed on material to foreign
powers, he did invest considerable time collecting material that was
clearly outside his normal duties in the military, authorities alleged in
the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in early 1999 and continuing through his military retirement
the next year, Regan allegedly used his position in the signals
intelligence section of the National Reconnaissance Office to peruse the
military's secure Intelink system and gain access to information on the
military preparedness of Iran, Iraq, Libya and China.</TE>
<TE>   Regan was arrested last August as he attempted to board a flight for
Germany at Washington's Dulles International Airport. In his wallet,
authorities said, was found encrypted notes about classified material,
along with addresses, phone numbers and other information for Chinese and
Iraqi embassies in Switzerland, Austria and France. More addresses were
hidden in the sole of his shoe, according to the indictment.</TE>

<HD>Officers Tied to Beatings in Ala. Defended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>The city's police chief said Thursday that "idiotic judgment," not
racism, was behind the actions of eight white officers accused of
planting evidence and beating blacks.</LD>
<LD>   Federal and state authorities are reviewing at least three incidents
involving the officers, the most recent of which occurred Jan. 28, when
one officer allegedly beat a handcuffed black teenager, challenged him to
a fistfight, then sprayed him with Mace.</LD>
<LD>   The eight officers resigned after an internal investigation began last
week. A police review board recommended three other officers be dismissed
for witnessing but not reporting similar incidents.</LD>
<TE>   Chief John Wilson said some of the officers would likely face criminal
charges, but he denied any racism on their part.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what we're dealing with is an abundance of idiotic judgment
and outright criminal activity," said Wilson, who is white.</TE>
<TE>   "Some were leaders of the misconduct. Some knew it happened but didn't
report it, which makes them just as much involved," he said. "I'm
thoroughly convinced some will go to jail before this is over."</TE>
<TE>   The officers, all of whom worked on the overnight shift, face other
allegations of planting evidence, jailing a person on false charges, and
throwing rocks and bottles at a suspected crack house. City officials
said all the victims were black.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Serial N.Y. Hit-Run Held</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man allegedly returns to scene of first midtown incident, in
which 19 were struck, and crashes into 7 more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A bizarre Manhattan serial hit-and-run case took a turn Thursday,
with midtown pedestrians again paying the price.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after crashing his sedan into 19 people along a 20-block
stretch, authorities said, Ronald Popadich carjacked a vehicle at a New
Jersey mall, then returned to the scene of Tuesday's first hit-and-run
crime, crashing into seven people in a midtown crosswalk.</LD>
<LD>   Just as he had Tuesday, authorities said, Popadich left the mayhem
behind by fleeing into the subway.</LD>
<TE>   About 90 minutes after abandoning the carjacked Volkswagen Jetta in
Manhattan, Popadich was arrested at his mother's home in Garfield, N.J.,
not far from where a woman police believe he shot was found critically
wounded Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Popadich admitted that he deliberately crashed into his
victims on both days.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Popadich, 39, crashed into three people crossing Seventh
Avenue at 34th Street. He then made a U-turn and slammed into four more
pedestrians on the other side of Seventh before speeding away, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Popadich drove another block and then, bleeding from the nose, pushed
through a crowd before ducking into the subway, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Left in the car was a .32-caliber, six-shot Smith &amp; Wesson handgun
police believe Popadich used to shoot Lisa Gotkin, 40. She was shot
twice.</TE>
<TE>   While police in riot gear and bloodhounds searched the midtown area,
Popadich later told authorities, he jumped into a taxi and made the
15-mile trip to his mother's home.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said that Popadich's mother, Violet, then called Bergen
County police and told them her son had returned. The 77-year-old mother
then left the house.</TE>
<TE>   Police surrounded the house with guns drawn as Popadich hid in the
basement, authorities said. They spoke to him by phone and he came
outside at 12:40 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that one pedestrian hit Thursday was in serious
condition, one was treated and released and the other five were in stable
condition at hospitals, police said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the injuries from Tuesday's hit-and-run were life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Popadich, held in the Bergen County Jail in Hackensack, was to be
arraigned on attempted murder and weapons charges today.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that somebody came into our city and hurt our citizens
. . . and that he's caught," said New York Police Department Chief of
Detectives William Allee. "He's not going to do it again."</TE>

<HD>Giant Underwater Waves Churn Off Hawaii Shores</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>Waves the height of skyscrapers are churning the waters of the
Pacific just off Hawaii, scientists reported Wednesday, but there's no
chance of tsunami, and boaters won't even notice. The waves are
underwater.</LD>
<LD>   A three-year project has been charting waves and subsurface tides up
to 1,000 feet high that researchers say offer new information about the
often mysterious mixing of ocean waters that warms lower depths and
allows sea life to prosper.</LD>
<LD>   "Imagine such a wave on the surface. It would be quite a frightening
sight," said Daniel Rudnick of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at
UC San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists now have concrete evidence that the 1,600-mile mostly
underwater volcanic ridge that forms the Hawaiian and Northern Hawaiian
Islands also forms an underwater barrier to tides that spawn the giant
water movements, said researcher Robert Pinkel, who is also with the
Scripps Institution.</TE>
<TE>   Rudnick, Pinkel and other scientists reported the latest studies of
the Pacific at the annual Ocean Sciences Meeting here.</TE>
<TE>   Waves break in the hidden depths off Oahu and Kauai just as the surf
does on Hawaii's beaches, Pinkel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Their signature on the surface is very slight," he said, describing
the underwater turbulence as a life-sustaining phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists describe the mixing of the oceans as essential to
maintaining temperatures and dispersing nutrients for sea life. But less
than 10% of the mixing is completely understood, and extensive research
remains to be done, Pinkel said.</TE>
<TE>   Where the sea floor is roughest, the mixing rates are 1,000 times more
intense than places without such topography, according to Tom Sanford and
Eric Kunze of Washington's Applied Physics Laboratory.</TE>

the future site of Bill Clinton's presidential library in the expectation
that lots of black tourists will come to pay homage to the man once
called "our first black president."</LD>
<LD>   The library will not open until 2004, but the shops on President
Clinton Avenue already are enjoying some success, thanks to a temporary
exhibit of Clinton memorabilia and expansion of the city's River Market
district.</LD>
<LD>   "Moving down here is about being at the right place at the right
time," said Deun Shonowo, who sells West African clothing, ceramics and
art at her Afrikan de Boutique. "One of the main reasons I moved down
here was the library and the tourists."</LD>
<TE>   Clinton announced in 1997 that he would build his presidential library
complex on the south bank of the Arkansas River. The site is next to the
River Market section of upscale shops, pubs and trendy restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   In December, ground was broken for the complex, which will include a
museum and academic center. The next day, a preview exhibit opened
nearby, bringing an increase in downtown visitors--black and white.</TE>
<TE>   Lenora Taylor of North Little Rock, who volunteered during Clinton
campaigns, toured the exhibit recently with a senior citizens group and
said she expects the library to bring black tourists from around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "I have family from California to Michigan who want to know about the
library," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Little Rock teacher Joann Williams brought her racially mixed
fifth-grade class to the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the exhibit had an important message for her students:
"President Clinton had the decency and dignity to let people know that
African Americans are capable."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit features pictures of Clinton with musicians Stevie Wonder
and Lenny Kravitz, a signed guitar given to Clinton by B.B. King and
numerous gifts from African heads of state.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' students were drawn to a statue of Michael Jordan that the
basketball star gave to Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "This is tight," said Keagan Scribner, 11. "I didn't know President
Clinton liked Michael Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Toni Morrison once referred to Clinton as the nation's first
black president because of what many regard as his understanding of the
black condition and because of his upbringing. He grew up poor and was
raised for a time by a single mother.</TE>
<TE>   "We love him, we celebrate him, we just believe in him. He has always
given African Americans their just due," said the Rev. Arthur Hughes of
West Helena.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal Altenbaumer, director of the Clinton Birthplace Foundation in
Hope, said about 40% of those who tour the Clinton birthplace are black.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of black families that include the Clinton center in
their reunions. The last one was a reunion in Pine Bluff with people from
five states. They rented a bus to come here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Skip Rutherford, president of the Clinton Library Foundation, said
among the ideas for marketing the library to black tour groups is
promoting nearby attractions such as Little Rock's Central High School,
where in September 1957 the federal government sent in Army paratroopers
to protect nine black students admitted to the all-white school, and the
National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn.,
where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ingraham of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., president of the National
Assn. of Black Hotel Owners, Operators and Developers and director of a
marketing firm specializing in multicultural tourism, said the library is
a "big deal in terms of economic impact and an opportunity for African
American vendors to get a piece of the pie."</TE>

<HD>House Panel Debates Amtrak Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>House Democrats gave a cool reception Thursday to a proposal to
break up Amtrak, voicing concerns about routes in their states and the
impact of free-market competition in passenger train service.</LD>
<LD>   "Let's not 'Balkanize' Amtrak," Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.) said
at a hearing of the House Transportation subcommittee on railroads.</LD>
<LD>   Oberstar and other lawmakers questioned a 1997 law that has put Amtrak
on the brink of major change. The law required Amtrak to operate without
government subsidies by December 2003--something the Amtrak Reform
Council has said won't happen.</LD>
<TE>   Amtrak lost $1.1 billion last year, the most in its history.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect Amtrak to operate where the country needs it, yet any
profit-oriented business would refuse to serve money-losing routes," said
Rep. Jack Quinn (R-N.Y.), chairman of the railroads subcommittee. He said
the federal government has not spent enough on developing a national
train network.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing was held to discuss a report from the council, a
government oversight panel that recommended dividing Amtrak into three
pieces: one to make policy, one to oversee the tracks and stations Amtrak
owns in the Boston-Washington Northeast corridor, and the third to
conduct train operations.</TE>
<TE>   The reform council said that, after a transition period of two to five
years, private companies should be allowed to submit bids for franchises
to run various routes.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger rail is the exclusive domain of Amtrak, which Congress
created in 1971 because freight railways were losing money carrying
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats on the panel said they support maintaining an
Amtrak-controlled system and devoting more federal dollars to rail.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said the Federal Highway Administration
received $32 billion this year, compared with $521 million for Amtrak. "I
don't hear anyone arguing the highway system is bankrupting the country,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>6 or 7 Hours of Sleep Is Better, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Don't fret if you don't get eight hours of sleep a night: New
research suggests adults live longer if they get six or seven.</LD>
<LD>   Still, even the study's authors say it is not time to reset the alarm
clock.</LD>
<LD>   The research is based on a nationwide survey of 1.1 million adults. It
found that those who slept eight hours a night were 12% more likely to
die within six years than those who got 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 hours of sleep.
The increased risk was more than 15% for those who reported getting more
than 8 1/2 hours or fewer than about four hours nightly.</LD>
<TE>   The participants were ages 30 to 102. Few reported frequent insomnia.</TE>
<TE>   The study was published in February's Archives of General Psychiatry.</TE>
<TE>   Sleep experts said the research has several flaws. It was not designed
to look at sleep's effect on longevity but relied on patients'
recollections of their sleep habits and did not ask if they took naps.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of Northwestern Memorial Hospital's sleep
disorders center, said the results probably do not reflect the general
population because participants were not randomly selected but were
mainly friends and relatives of volunteers for the American Cancer
Society, which collected the data as part of a 1982 survey on cancer
risks.</TE>
<TE>   Zee said it is possible that participants who got little sleep or
slept eight hours or more had medical problems that would explain their
increased death rate.</TE>
<TE>   The research neglects strong evidence that there are natural sleep
variations, said psychologist Rosalind Cartwright of the sleep disorders
center at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "There are natural-born short sleepers who are perfectly healthy with
fewer than six or fewer hours," Cartwright said.</TE>

<HD>Visitors to Greenwich, Conn., Must Now Pay to Use Beaches</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREENWICH, Conn.
</DL>
<LD>This wealthy New York suburb adopted an ordinance Thursday forcing
out-of-towners who want to visit its beaches to pay $408 in permits.</LD>
<LD>   The Greenwich Board of Selectmen voted, 2 to 1, in favor of the
seasonal passes, with no option for visitors to buy a day pass. Greenwich
previously had a residents-only beach policy, which the state Supreme
Court ruled unconstitutional in July.</LD>
<LD>   Stamford attorney Brenden Leydon had brought the case to the court
after being turned away while attempting to jog on a beach in 1995.
Leydon said the seasonal pass was still elitist and promised to bring the
issue back to court.</LD>
<TE>   Leydon said the law "clearly violates the letter and the spirit" of
the court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the plan represents costs paid by residents' property
taxes to maintain the pristine beaches.</TE>
<TE>   It requires a nonresident to buy a seasonal pass for $308, and another
$100 to park a vehicle. Pass holders could bring guests for $6 each, but
would be limited to 30 guest passes.</TE>

<HD>Unlike His Boss, Powell Takes Pro-Condom Stand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on Thursday strongly advocated
condom use to prevent the spread of AIDS, setting himself apart from
President Bush's views on sex education and angering some of the
president's closest supporters on the political right.</LD>
<LD>   "It is important that the whole international community come together,
speak candidly about it, forget about taboos, forget about conservative
ideas with respect to what you should tell young people about," Powell
told an MTV music channel audience. "It's the lives of young people that
are put at risk by unsafe sex. And, therefore, protect yourself."</LD>
<LD>   Powell's remarks, aired Thursday night on MTV and scheduled for
rebroadcast around the globe, are consistent with U.S. support of
international AIDS prevention programs. But they appeared to diverge from
the message delivered by the president and other administration officials
that abstinence from unmarried sex is the principal weapon against the
spread of the deadly human immunodeficiency virus.</LD>
<TE>   The secretary of State's comments prompted a round of hisses and
cheers. Ken Connor, president of the conservative Family Research
Council, said Powell's remarks were "reckless and irresponsible" and a
"slap in the face" to the president's core constituency.</TE>
<TE>   Powell is "skilled in areas of diplomacy," said Gary Bauer, former
Republican presidential candidate and president of American Values, but
on "public health issues, he should follow the lead of the Bush
administration which he serves." Bauer said condoms give teenagers a
false sense of security, a view shared by Tom Coburn, the new chairman of
Bush's advisory commission on AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   But Marsha Martin, director of the liberal advocacy group AIDS Action,
said of Powell: "We want to salute him and say, 'Bravo!' He is a member
of the Bush administration, so I would say we are getting perhaps a new
message and a welcome message about HIV prevention."</TE>
<TE>   The president has remained somewhat elliptical in his public
statements about condom use, opting instead to tout abstinence as the
preferred mode of prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Surgeon General David Satcher caught the ire of White
House officials with a detailed report on sexuality that said there is no
evidence that teaching abstinence-only works.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer distanced the administration
from Satcher, noting that the doctor had been appointed by President
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   While conservatives cranked up their criticism, administration
spokesmen said Powell's message meshed with White House policy.</TE>

<HD>Energy Chief Urges Yucca Mountain for Nuclear Waste</HD>
<DH>Environment: Bush's support for the site is expected after Abraham
recommends the Nevada location.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham formally recommended Thursday
that Yucca Mountain, 90 miles from Los Vegas, be developed as the final
resting spot for 77,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to the White House, Abraham said that 20 years and $4
billion in scientific study give him "confidence" that Yucca Mountain is
the right place for the depository.</LD>
<LD>   He assured President Bush that the site "will be able to protect the
health and safety of the public."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn said the state is braced for
the president to throw his support behind Yucca Mountain, perhaps as
early as today.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has been prepared for quite some time" for Yucca
Mountain to be selected, said Greg Bortolin, a spokesman for Guinn. "He
has said all along that he will veto that decision when the time comes."</TE>
<TE>   Guinn, Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) met with
Bush on Feb. 7 in the Oval Office to press Nevada's case that Yucca
Mountain should not be chosen.</TE>
<TE>   All three Nevadans said after the meeting that they thought the
president was attentive in listening to their case.</TE>
<TE>   "And at that meeting," Bortolin said Thursday, "the governor told the
president to his face that he [Guinn] would veto any decision to develop
Yucca Mountain."</TE>
<TE>   Several procedural hurdles will remain once the president approves the
plan, but his verdict would make development of the site likely.</TE>
<TE>   After Guinn formally objects to the plan, Congress will have 90
legislative days to overrule his objection.</TE>
<TE>   A simple majority in both the House and the Senate is needed to
overrule a governor's rejection. Reid, who ardently opposes burying waste
at Yucca Mountain, believes he has only a 40% chance, at best, to
persuade enough members of Congress to join him in opposing the site,
according to his spokesman, Nathan Naylor.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional approval of the plan would not be the final word. The
proposal would then go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for
licensing, a process that could take several years. Even then, the
project still could be rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the president's announcement would serve as an important
landmark in a 40-year search for a safe storage place for the vast
quantities of highly radioactive material now at nuclear power plants and
other facilities in 39 states.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration argues that consolidating the waste in one
national nuclear dump would help protect the country from the threat of
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But Nevadans, along with environmentalists around the country, argue
that transporting the spent fuel on trucks and train cars would create an
even greater risk for terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The waste contains radioactive elements that remain active, and
potentially life-threatening, for hundreds of thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has signaled his strong support for consolidating nuclear waste
in one depository, and since 1987, Yucca Mountain has been the only site
under consideration.</TE>
<TE>   In his recommendation, Abraham stressed that the Yucca Mountain site
is "technically suitable" and "the science behind this project is sound."</TE>
<TE>   Abraham said the site would support nuclear nonproliferation aims by
providing a secure place to put nuclear waste from decommissioned
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   It also would play a key role in protecting the nation's energy supply
by ensuring a storage place for waste from nuclear power plants, which
account for 20% of the nation's energy, and help the environment by
providing a storage site for nuclear material from cleanups of defense
waste sites.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn and other state officials are expected to fight the proposal
vehemently. The state of Nevada already has sued to block the development
of Yucca Mountain on environmental grounds and has threatened more
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   But even Reid, who as Senate majority whip wields power in the
chamber, conceded that the struggle against turning Yucca into a nuclear
waste dump is an uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   Reid and the rest of Nevada's congressional delegation are trying to
win support by stressing to their colleagues that if the project is
approved, tons of nuclear waste will be transported through most states.
That prospect, he said, could prove unsettling to many senators'
constituents.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in San Bernardino County, which borders Nevada and through
which nuclear waste would travel, have expressed concern that the
Department of Energy has not adequately addressed the risk posed to
communities along the nuclear waste route.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the administration's decision pointed to a Government
Accounting Office report released late last month that said it was
"premature" by several years to recommend the site because of the many
unresolved technical and scientific issues on the project.</TE>
<TE>   The report by the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress said
hundreds of scientific tests and experiments must still be conducted to
determine if nuclear waste can be safely stored for more than 10,000
years in containers below Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO said it didn't believe that the site would be operational
before 2015.</TE>
<TE>   But the nuclear industry is impatient for a site to be designated and
stressed that the federal government has been legally obligated to start
receiving spent nuclear fuel from power plants since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department has said it would like to open the facility in
2010.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate confirmed the son of Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) for a
federal judgeship Thursday, setting aside a finding by the American Bar
Assn. that he is unqualified.</LD>
<LD>   The confirmation of David Bunning, 35, as a U.S. district judge in the
Eastern District of Kentucky along with James Gritzner of Iowa for a
district court judgeship in his home state and Richard Leon of Maryland
for a seat in Washington, D.C., came by voice vote.</LD>
<LD>   The nominations were approved without debate.</LD>
<TE>   After investigating Bunning's qualifications, the American Bar Assn.
told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Bunning was not fit for the
lifetime post.</TE>
<TE>   Bunning, an assistant U.S. attorney in eastern Kentucky, is two years
short of the 12 years of experience the ABA recommends for federal
judges.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush selected the younger Bunning to be a judge for the
Eastern District of Kentucky in August.</TE>
<TE>   Bunning said his work as a Kentucky prosecutor prepared him for a
federal judgeship.</TE>

<HD>Suit Against Ex-Los Alamos Scientist Dismissed</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit against former
Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee after government attorneys warned that
national security could be compromised if the case went to trial.</LD>
<LD>   Notra Trulock, the Energy Department's former security chief, sued Lee
and two government investigators. Trulock claimed they damaged his
reputation by claiming that he singled out Lee because of his ethnicity
as the prime suspect behind a series of security breaches at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   Lee, a Taiwanese-born naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested in
December 1999 on suspicion of spying for China and indicted on 59 felony
counts alleging he transferred nuclear weapon information to portable
computer tapes.</LD>
<TE>   Although Lee denied giving information to China and never was charged
with spying, he was held in solitary confinement for nine months. As the
government's case crumbled, Lee pleaded guilty to a felony count of
downloading sensitive material and was set free. President Clinton
apologized for Lee's treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Trulock's lawsuit was scheduled for trial next week. U.S. District
Judge Claude Hilton dismissed the lawsuit Tuesday after government
attorneys said state secrets could be compromised.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas J. Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch,
which represents Trulock, said the case could have gone forward without
jeopardizing classified information. He said Trulock would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is payback to Notra Trulock for being critical of the
intelligence establishment in this town," Fitton said. "The government
has done nothing but try to throw a monkey wrench into this case, and
they've done it to avoid embarrassment."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller would not comment on
Fitton's claims.</TE>
<TE>   Lee's attorney, Frank Volpe, said it is unfair to accuse the
government of meddling. He said Lee's defense hinged on information in
Trulock's initial report that identified Lee as the most likely source of
security breaches at Los Alamos.</TE>
<TE>   But the government said the report could not be released without
compromising state secrets, making it impossible for Lee to defend
himself.</TE>
<TE>   A recently declassified Justice Department review of Lee's case was
harshly critical of Trulock's initial inquiry but said Lee was not
singled out because of his race.</TE>
<TE>   That contradicted statements made by former Los Alamos
counterintelligence chief Robert Vrooman and Trulock's predecessor,
Charles Washington. Both said racial profiling led investigators to focus
on Lee.</TE>
