<HD>Fox to Produce a Hindi Film</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOMBAY, India</DL>
<LD>Twentieth Century Fox will produce a Bollywood movie, the first time
a foreign production house will produce a Hindi-language film, a Fox
official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Bollywood is the name often used for India's Bombay-based film
industry.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a perfect match for both of us. The movie will have our
strengths and we will also make sure the movie is successfully
marketed and presented," said Aditya Shastri, head of Fox's India
unit.</LD>
<TE>   Fox has teamed with Bollywood director Ram Gopal Varma for a
thriller called "Ek Hasina Thi" (There Was a Beautiful Girl), to
start filming in August, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It will star Indian actors Urmila Matondkar and Saif Ali Khan and
will cost about $1.2 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy to tie up with Varma because of the quality of his
films," said Shastri.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, is in talks with Varma
for two other projects.</TE>
<TE>   Varma is well-known in India for directing films such as
"Company," released in April, about the Bombay mafia.</TE>
<TE>   The film industry in India produces nearly 800 movies a year that
are watched all over Asia, the Middle East and by Indian migrants
worldwide.</TE>

<LD>Great fiddle playing seems to be a staple at the Hollywood Bowl this
summer, with the debut of Elisabeth Batiashvili there last week and
the return Tuesday night of charismatic, accomplished 24-year-old
Leila Josefowicz, who first played in this setting before she was a
teenager.</LD>
<LD>   It is no secret that we are in a golden age of violinists, and one
of the reasons is superior teaching. Josefowicz, for example, while
at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, studied with Jaime Laredo,
the guest conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic on Tuesday.
Student and mentor shared the spotlight twice on this evening, first
in Bach's D-minor Concerto for Two Violins, then, as finale, in
Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364, for Violin and Viola.</LD>
<LD>   The playing of the two proved exceptional, stylish and highly
satisfying. With easy virtuosity and exquisite matching of tone,
Josefowicz and Laredo--the conductor-violinist-violist is a major
chamber music figure we sometimes take for granted and
shouldn't--performed this familiar music effortlessly and in genuine
rapport with orchestra and audience.</LD>
<TE>   The slow movements in particular, directional, single-minded and
beautifully poignant, pleased the most.</TE>
<TE>   To play this softly, but with deep projection, in an outdoor
amphitheater the size of the Bowl takes not just great technique but
also great courage. And musicianship this subtle and articulate must
be cherished.</TE>
<TE>   Separating the two solo vehicles, Laredo conducted a smooth and
warmhearted account of Mendelssohn's "Italian" Symphony. The
orchestra played with an easy panache.</TE>

<HD>Triumph of a Common Touch</HD>
<DH>Pop Beat* El Gran Combo, the venerable Puerto Rican salsa
band, has thrived for 40 years by authentically reflecting, with
affection and humor, everyday Latino life. *</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like marriages, salsa bands love to celebrate anniversaries.</LD>
<LD>   In this genre, hitting silver doesn't signify that a band sold so
many units. It means they've been together for 25 years. That's not
an uncommon milestone for groups from Cuba and Puerto Rico, where
bands become institutions that even outlive their founders, batons
passed from father to son.</LD>
<LD>   But few groups have aged with as much grace and vitality as El
Gran Combo, the beloved dance band founded 40 years ago by Rafael
Ithier, its pianist, arranger and benevolent director. The group,
which performs tonight at the Hollywood Park Casino, is salsa's
Rolling Stones, but with a current hit.</LD>
<TE>   That's the thing about this band: People don't get tired of it.
Its style hasn't changed much, but somehow it never sounds stale. You
can call it a formula: Strong vocals, flashy showmanship, infectious
rhythms and layered, interlacing horn lines. El Gran Combo has that
common touch, with songs that often reflect everyday Latino life with
authenticity, affection and a sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   How can people get tired of having fun?</TE>
<TE>   "I try to make music that is digestible, something people can
easily assimilate," said the gravel-voiced Ithier this week during a
phone interview in Spanish from Puerto Rico. "If you make things too
complicated, well, the public won't understand it. That's why we've
remained a favorite of the masses."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it's not as simple as that. El Gran Combo has remained a
favorite of critics too. That's quite an accomplishment in an art
form that prizes innovation as well as tradition. The band has
managed to remain relevant while remaining true to its roots.</TE>
<TE>   As a pianist, the 75-year-old Ithier is not experimental like
Eddie Palmieri or jazzy like Papo Lucca of the Sonora Poncena,
another veteran outfit from Puerto Rico. He has a light, tinkling
touch, more adornment than showpiece. He rarely takes solos, but
without his jaunty keyboard as a cornerstone, there would be no Gran
Combo.</TE>
<TE>   The subtle intricacy of his playing shines clearly on the band's
latest album, "Aniversario 40 en Vivo," a live recording of its
40th-anniversary concert on April 27 in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. The
band sounds tighter and punchier than ever on the record, which
faithfully captures the spontaneity of its performances. The singers
offer new, improvised verses and Ithier's fanciful piano laces the
breaks with cascades of notes.</TE>
<TE>   But hurry if you want the double CD, which is being recalled from
stores by BMG US Latin amid a legal dispute over publishing rights
with Cartagena Publishing, whose owners have worked with the group
for decades.</TE>
<TE>   El Gran Combo has weathered challenges from the start.</TE>
<TE>   The term "salsa" didn't even exist in 1962 when the group started.
President Kennedy was still in the White House and the world was
headed toward a potential nuclear confrontation over Cuba, the
musical powerhouse of the Caribbean. The Cold War would eventually
shift the musical balance of power toward Cuba's tiny Antillean
cousin, Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Ithier had been a member of the seminal Puerto Rican group led by
Rafael Cortijo, which also yielded the acclaimed bands of
percussionist Roberto Roena and singer Ismael Rivera. The nucleus of
El Gran Combo included Ithier and half a dozen fellow Cortijo
defectors. Today, only Ithier and sax player Eddie "La Bala" Perez
remain from the founding group.</TE>
<TE>   In its early years, the young band faced animosity from Cortijo
loyalists who considered them musical traitors, Ithier recalls. They
struggled to gain a foothold during the '60s, dabbling in the
boogaloo craze.</TE>
<TE>   The band's identity and popularity didn't jell until the 1971
release of the landmark "De Punta a Punta" (From One End to the
Other). It was the group's first album on its own label, EGC, and it
remains a classic of the Puerto Rican school of salsa.</TE>
<TE>   It featured the vocals of Andy Montanez and Pellin Rodriguez,
whose distinctive timbres would help forge the band's style. For
years, most fans remembered the band by its charismatic frontmen.
When they eventually left for solo careers, it was like a traumatic
divorce.</TE>
<TE>   The departure of Montanez was particularly painful. The two were
compadres, Ithier having been godfather to his singer's oldest
daughter. Not to mention that El Gran Combo owed its distinctive
sound largely to Montanez's incredibly powerful and sonorous vocals.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it was Montanez's career that floundered. El Gran Combo kept
right on going.</TE>
<TE>   Montanez--who makes a guest appearance on the live album with a
medley of his old hits--was replaced by Jerry Rivas, one of salsa's
most underrated soneros, or improvisational singers.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, Rivas has shared vocal duties with Charlie Aponte, who
replaced Pellin Rodriguez in 1973 and went on to sing lead on some of
the group's biggest hits, such as "Brujeria" (Witchcraft) and
"Telefono."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the '90s have not been the band's best decade. But while
its recent albums have been uneven, lacking in focus and spirit at
times, the hits have kept coming.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's studio album, "Nuevo Milenio--El Mismo Sabor" (New
Millennium, Same Taste), yielded the infectious "Me Libere" (I Freed
Myself), a satirical skewering of macho womanizers who feel like
victims of all their jealous and demanding lovers.</TE>
<TE>   Ithier says he didn't think much of the song, having to be
convinced by his band to include it. He now happily admits he was
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Resembling a dapper Duke Ellington, the avuncular Ithier has run
his outfit with discipline and democracy. No drugs or flakiness
allowed, but everybody has a voice.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all friends here," says Ithier, whose marriage predates the
formation of his band by three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody has to have the last word, but nobody feels superior to
anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   In Spanish, he speaks the words melodically: "Nadie se cree mejor
que nadie."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most pop music acts today are thought of in terms of what we see on
MTV. When RockFour played at the Roxy on Thursday, it was hard not to
think in terms of what we see on CNN.</LD>
<LD>   The Tel Aviv quartet, popular in Israel since the mid-'90s and
recently recording in English and reaching for an international
presence, had just enough elements in its set to justify evaluating
the music in light of current events.</LD>
<LD>   An Israeli flag was draped over an amplifier, and such key lyrics
as "We can't decide who's on our side" (in the opening "Astronauts")
fit easily into the context of Middle East headlines. But there's
much more to the band than that.</LD>
<TE>   Drawing on the '60s folk-psychedelia of the Byrds (prominently in
guitarist Baruch Ben- Izhak's Rickenbacker 12-string licks), the
Beatles (a powerful closing version of the Fab Four's "Rain") and the
Beach Boys (several echoes of the wistful "Pet Sounds"), RockFour
could easily fit alongside Sweden's Hives and the Soundtrack of Our
Lives or Detroit's the White Stripes in the current garage-rock
revival--though some sappy prog-rock touches were reminiscent of
numerous Eastern European bands.</TE>
<TE>   And the influences showed too transparently in places, though they
often benefited from some imaginative twists. Whatever messages are
in the music were not belabored. Singer-guitarist Eli Lulai showed no
signs of any overt political mission, preferring wry understatement.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the explosive bursts that punctuated several songs,
powered by Ben-Izhak's confident playing and Issar Tennenbaum's fiery
drumming, represented the real explosions and conflicts in the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps this is simply a strong, world-class band flexing its
musical muscles.</TE>

<LD>Growing Old: "Hollywood is marking the 40th anniversary of the first
James Bond movie, released in 1962. It's interesting to watch how as
Agent 007 gets older, his interests begin to change. The next James
Bond movie will be called 'License to Fish.' " (Argus Hamilton)</LD>
<LD>   Sound Effects: "A San Diego company is testing a new weapon that
shoots sonic bullets at targets. When fired, the gun sends out an
audio signal, which is rated at 140 decibels and totally disables its
victims; 140 decibels is the equivalent of a jet airplane taking off
or Yoko Ono singing." (Ira Lawson)</LD>
<LD>   Tales to Tell: "There are reports that Hillary Clinton has
finished her book while Bill hasn't even started his. Her book is
finished, which makes sense. With hers done first, it makes it easier
for him to get the story straight." (Jay Leno)</LD>

<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>This is Thomas Kinkade country. The land is flat and dry, the
thermometer climbs past the century mark. But Marie Antoinette-style
fantasies of a bucolic life adorn candy-colored billboards on the
highway leading into town, in pictures mass-produced in the workshops
of Kinkade, the self-proclaimed "Painter of Light." Stop by the
franchise gallery in a local mall and see.</LD>
<LD>   At the moment, though, Fresno can claim a different, more
compelling artistic distinction. It is the best place in the United
States right now to see European Old Master drawings and prints. A
touring exhibition of sheets by Michelangelo, Durer, Raphael, Rubens,
Rembrandt, Poussin and 66 other artists is at the Fresno Metropolitan
Museum of Art, History and Science, through Aug. 3. Among them are
unsurpassed works of graphic art offering deep satisfactions.</LD>
<LD>   Take the three ink drawings by German Renaissance whiz Albrecht
Durer. One is a sheet of three studies of a hand, gesticulating in
various ways, dated around 1494 or 1495. With the palm facing
forward, one hand points its index finger upward. Another pinches a
flower's delicate stem between thumb and forefinger. A third inserts
a thumb between fingers curled into a fist, making a famously rude
gesture.</LD>
<TE>   A heavenly benediction, a courtship gesture and a curse. Like
semaphore signals, the hands perform a sign language, based on
prototypes widely used in the Middle Ages.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the drawings are not the least bit medieval in feeling.
Redolent of probing curiosity, they're too specific, too
idiosyncratic, too flat-out personal for that.</TE>
<TE>   Each sketch shows a left hand intensely observed. The contours are
meticulous. The careful hatching of lines creates subtle light and
shade to suggest veins beneath skin or a cuff turned back at the
wrist, the better to expose the gesture.</TE>
<TE>   The quickness and surety of the ink line demonstrate the
astounding aesthetic possibilities contained within the human hand.
As much as the gestures performed in the pictures, Durer's drawn
marks are "hand signals" themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the sheet, you're suddenly struck by an otherwise
obvious fact: Durer was drawing with his right hand while
scrutinizing his own left hand. He is observing himself as an
artistic subject, as surely as if he were painting one of the
full-scale oil self-portraits that distinguish his remarkable career.
This small but riveting sheet of paper records an intimate fragment
of an epochal transition in Western art and society. A medieval
prototype segues into a personal utterance of humanist self-regard.</TE>
<TE>   And there are 79 more drawings and 22 more prints in this terrific
exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a later Durer drawing (1506) is less spontaneous, more
finished but no less astounding than the artist's captivating
hand-jive. Made in preparation for an altarpiece commissioned by a
group of Germans residing in Venice, who were eager to give their
countryman a chance to show his stuff amid the manifold splendors of
the Italian port city, it shows the head of an angel.</TE>
<TE>   Durer used pen and black ink with white highlighting on blue
paper, in the traditional Venetian manner. Seen from below in
three-quarter view, the lovely head framed by cascading curls of hair
turns atop a long, swan-like neck. Its contours are drawn with the
black ink, while the white records the play of light.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of the way up from the bottom of the sheet, and
equidistant from the sides, Durer placed the dark pupil of the
angel's right eye, which forms the compositional center of the
drawing. It's the pivot around which everything else turns. The eye
establishes a mystical core that corresponds with the human
instrument of visual perception.</TE>
<TE>   Two more Durer drawings are on view--one a study of heads and
feet, drawn on the reverse of the sheet with the three hands; the
other a dense preliminary design for a woodcut showing the Holy
Family. This abundance of Durers might give a clue as to the source
of the exhibition. "Masterworks From the Albertina" comes to Fresno
from Vienna's Graphische Sammlung Albertina. That museum, with nearly
65,000 drawings and about 1 million prints, is arguably Europe's
greatest collection of works on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Durer, represented in the holdings by 130 prints and drawings, is
a centerpiece. His watercolor study of a fat rabbit is perhaps the
most famous drawing in the immense collection, while I would be happy
to nominate his monumental study of a plant-strewn clump of dirt for
consideration as the Greatest European Drawing Ever Made. (Entire
galaxies seem to thrive within this teeming bit of earth.) The bunny
and the clump are not in Fresno--who'd let them leave Vienna?--but
much else of great note certainly is.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1985, the Albertina has circulated half a dozen exhibitions
from its collection to the United States. The first was a survey of
Old Master drawing seen at Washington's National Gallery of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent shows looked at particular subjects (landscapes during
Rembrandt's time), periods (the Italian Renaissance and Baroque eras)
or artists (Oskar Kokoschka). Typically they were seen at major
institutions, such as New York's Pierpont Morgan Library, Fort
Worth's Kimbell Art Museum or, in 1993, the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.</TE>
<TE>   The present survey, organized by the touring service ArtReach
International, is the first to travel to small museums outside large
metropolitan centers. Fresno is the final stop on a short tour that
began in Pittsburgh in January and proceeded to Louisville, Ky., in
the spring. In 1999 the Albertina began an extensive renovation of
its building, a former Hapsburg palace on the old ramparts of the
city, which provided the occasion for the touring show. The museum
will reopen in March.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition means to evoke the original guiding principle of
the Albertina's collection, which was formally launched in 1776 (on
the Fourth of July, no less). Enlightenment principles of edification
and moral purpose, rather than idle amusement, would guide the
assembly of works. Duke Albert von Sachsen-Teschen, who had married
the favorite daughter of the immensely wealthy Austrian empress Maria
Theresia, enlisted the aid of an Italian connoisseur to launch the
project. Three years later Count Durazzo turned over 1,000 drawings
and a statement of principle to the happy duke and duchess.</TE>
<TE>   So the exhibition looks at European art in the 300 years before
the collection's birth, and it's arranged in the traditional
Enlightenment manner of "national schools"--Italian, German, French,
Flemish and Dutch. History meets politics in the drawing room of
connoisseurship.</TE>
<TE>   The drapery studies by Michelangelo show him making drawing
central to the education of a Renaissance artist, where the fluid
graphic medium could record the unfolding process of artistic
thought--and thus signify art as something more than skillful craft.
A late red-chalk study of the dead Christ, whose attribution to
Michelangelo is uncertain, shows thought transformed into atmospheric
mysticism.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Paul Rubens' rambunctious drawing of his young son,
Nicholas, was surely done for the artist's personal pleasure--a
snapshot before the camera. Andrea Del Sarto's tender head of a bald
old man has empty eye sockets and a purposefully unfinished chin,
yielding a spare intimation of a death's-head skull.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Poussin's structured woodland landscape looks like a
Post-Impressionist Cezanne--albeit circa 1629. Veiled eroticism
drives Francois Boucher's sweet chalk study of a young woman who
clasps her hands above a swollen vessel.</TE>
<TE>   Chief among the show's prints is Rembrandt's justly famous
etching, the "Hundred Guilder Print," so called for the astounding
price it fetched upon completion in 1649. Rembrandt marshals three
dozen characters, not to mention a camel and a dog, to simultaneously
tell multiple tales from the gospel of Matthew in one big, lush,
theatrical pageant.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a dark hair-raising wood engraving of the witches'
Sabbath by Hans Baldung Grien and spooky, hand-colored landscape
etchings by Albrecht Altdorfer. Trees, mountains and fields here
assume an evocative character previously reserved for people.</TE>
<TE>   There are also terrific examples by less well-known (and even
unknown) artists. Giulio Romano's hunting scene uses the lateral
force of the jampacked composition to elicit the violent fury of
animal flesh being torn apart. An exquisite chalk and colored pencil
portrait of a young German man in a red cap is so refined it's
surprising its author remains unidentified.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, there are some pedestrian drawings too. No matter. The
wintry ice skaters by Abraham Rutgers and the biblical bombast of
Franz Anton Maulbertsch are pleasant enough, but they also provide
context. They demonstrate how commonplace drawing once was as a
medium for artists.</TE>

<LD>How can our schools teach children respect for the past if they have
none themselves?</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Unified's decision to raze the KEHE radio building is another
harmful, destructive act by an ignorant bureaucracy--and adds another
significant landmark to L.A.'s long obituary of demolished
architecture ("Failing a Landmark," July 15, by Nicolai Ouroussoff.)</LD>
<LD>   There are many successful Moderne schools in Los Angeles still in
use, so why not build a school that complements the existing
structure?</LD>
<TE>   A creative architect would be able to incorporate KEHE into the
new school, while giving this landmark a much-needed renovation.</TE>
<TE>   I almost never vote for policy that raises taxes, unless it
benefits education. This latest outrage by L.A. Unified may change my

<LD>Regarding Robert Hilburn's commentary on Michael Jackson ("It's Time
for Jackson to Face the Music," July 17): It might behoove Mr.
Jackson to take to heart the words of the great UCLA basketball coach
John Wooden: "You aren't a failure until you start blaming others for
your mistakes."</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I've been a fan of Michael Jackson going all the way to the
Jackson 5, and watching him blame everybody but himself for the poor
reception of "Invincible" is indeed a very sad and pathetic thing to
watch.</TE>
<TE>   It is obvious that Jackson has slipped into Never Never Land and
has refused to grow up. So does it really surprise anybody he acts
like a child when his album only sells 5 million units?</TE>
<TE>   Get those yes-men away from Michael, and maybe then it's back to
innovative ground-breaking music like he did before.</TE>
<TE>   CHUCK MORAN</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read a very biased article on Michael Jackson. The media claims
nobody cares about him anymore, yet his words about Thomas D. Mottola
[Sony Music Entertainment chairman] have been all over the news.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because he sells papers! The sad thing is that Michael is
right when he said the hate started when he began breaking Elvis
Presley's and the Beatles' records.</TE>
<TE>   The media fail to see the flaws that Elvis and the Beatles had,
but they are quick to point out Bobby Brown's flaws, or Whitney
Houston's or any black artist in trouble.</TE>

<LD>Lewis Segal does seem to have a nasty streak ("Stars Salvage ABT's

<LD>Regarding Don Shirley's review of the Shakespeare Festival's
production of "Romeo and Juliet," in particular his lament that the
Pershing Square venue "dissipates much of the energy generated on
stage" (" 'Romeo' Has Pop; No Snap or Crackle," July 13):</LD>
<LD>   On a recent summer evening I leaned relaxed against a low wall at
Pershing Square and watched this production amid local inhabitants,
Shakespeare zealots, business suits, neighborhood families and those
extravagantly tall edifices that ascend like monoliths outbound
toward the moon and whose magnificent presence fell softly like a
shroud of sublime ambience upon a fine performance.</LD>
<LD>   Behind a section of reserved seating in close proximity to the
stage, playgoers were comfortably reclined on picnic blankets, in
beach and camping chairs and creatively perched on walls.</LD>
<TE>   Across Olive Street I noticed a few guests of the elegant Biltmore
as they peered curiously from their hotel room windows.</TE>
<TE>   By performing "Romeo and Juliet" in Pershing Square free, the
Shakespeare Festival provides what is otherwise unobtainable to a
large portion of the audience in attendance in a public and unique
setting.</TE>
<TE>   To attempt to make Pershing Square more intimate would detract
from the ambience inherent in an urban park setting and only succeed
in making the venue less inviting to the exact people the Shakespeare
Festival hopes to reach with its performances.</TE>

<LD>Michael Mallory, shame on you! How can you write an entire article
about animators who give voice to their own characters and not
mention the multitalented Seth MacFarlane? ("Voicing Their
Creations," July 16.)</LD>
<LD>   MacFarlane adeptly voiced his "Family Guy" misfits Peter, Brian
the dog and Stewie the maniacal baby (among others) for two
gloriously underappreciated seasons on Fox.</LD>
<LD>   It has to be the crowning achievement of animators turned voice
artists. He didn't just lend "noises" to his creations, as did Chris
Sanders and Chris Wedge. He created funny, distinctly different
characters on a weekly basis.</LD>
<TE>   If Mike Judge received two Annie Awards for a single character
(Hank Hill), then MacFarlane deserves an armload of Emmys.</TE>
<TE>   Shame on Fox as well for cutting this bit of hysteria loose. My
hope is that the twisted MacFarlane has more quirky characters and
voices to unleash on the unsuspecting public soon!</TE>

<LD>I guess I should be used to this kind of thing by now, but I'm not.
It was just so depressing to read in Calendar (Morning Report, July
16) that Paul McCartney--one of the wealthiest human beings on the
entire planet--sees fit to charge his fans an "average" of $130 per
ticket. What happened to all you need is love?</LD>

<LD>   'Not the Best News,' Says Sharon Osbourne</LD>
<LD>   After having a foot of her colon surgically removed earlier this
month, Sharon Osbourne--wife of heavy-metal rocker Ozzy Osbourne and
matriarch of the MTV "reality" series "The Osbournes"--has revealed
that her cancer has spread.</LD>
<TE>   "It was not the best news," she told People magazine for its
current issue. "You think nothing will ever happen to you. You're
invincible. Then after you get over the shock and panic, you realize
how lucky you are to be alive."</TE>
<TE>   Network cameras will follow Osbourne through three months of
chemotherapy, beginning July 29. New episodes start airing in the
fall.</TE>
<TE>   The 49-year-old was diagnosed with colorectal cancer on July 1 and
underwent surgery two days later. On July 8, one of two lymph nodes
removed tested positive for cancerous cells--a sign that the cancer
had spread.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the couple's 16-year-old son Jack was treated for an
arm injury Wednesday after jumping off the Malibu pier along with
several other teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Submarine Portrayal Ruffles Russian Feathers</TE>
<TE>   Though the new Harrison Ford submarine thriller "K-19: The
Widowmaker" won't hit Russian movie theaters until October, it's
already generating friction in Moscow from experts who consulted on
the film.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-starring Liam Neeson, the story
is based on a 1961 accident aboard a Russian nuclear submarine that
came close to a meltdown in the North Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   "This film isn't about Russians but about how Americans want to
see Russians," Igor Kurdin, head of a St. Petersburg-based group of
retired submariners, told the Russian newspaper Izvestia on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans groups have threatened to the sue the filmmakers over
alleged inaccuracies such as the heavy drinking habits aboard the
subs and what they say is an incorrect portrayal of the conflict in
leadership between the ship's two top officers, the newspaper
reports.</TE>
<TE>   The incident remains a sensitive topic in the country. Russian
distributors of the movie have pledged 1% of the proceeds for
families of its 118 victims.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Rubens' Owner Springs for New Frame</TE>
<TE>   David Thomson, the billionaire chairman of the Thomson newspaper
group, has been identified as the telephone bidder said to have edged
out the J. Paul Getty Museum in an auction for Rubens' recently
discovered masterpiece "The Massacre of the Innocents." It sold at a
price of $76.2 million--the third-highest price ever paid for a
painting and the highest for an Old Master.</TE>
<TE>   The group's flagship, the Toronto Globe and Mail, revealed that
Thomson bought the piece for his father, Lord Thomson of Fleet, who
had hankered after the painting.</TE>
<TE>   And, according to the London newspaper the Guardian, he's spending
an additional $31,000 because he's unhappy with the frame.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Mitchell, an art historian and picture framer for Thomson,
called the painting--a brutal depiction of Roman soldiers
slaughtering newborn babies at the order of King Herod--the painterly
equivalent of "a colossal Twentieth Century Fox film." The present
frame, made in the 18th or 19th century, was "too static," he said.
And "an improperly framed work is like an automobile running on three
cylinders."</TE>
<TE>   The British art community hopes that the family, former owners of
the London Times, might lend the painting to the National Gallery,
where it could hang next to Rubens' "Samson and Delilah."</TE>
<TE>   But Lord Thomson is negotiating to give some or all of his
prolific art collection to the Art Gallery of Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Michael Embarking on an Olympian Task?</TE>
<TE>   British pop singer George Michael is mulling over a request from
the Athens Olympic Committee to write a theme song for the 2004
Games, a spokesman for the artist said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old Michael's Greek roots are apparent in his original
name--Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou--though he was born in north
London.</TE>
<TE>   Michael has made headlines in the past few weeks as a result of
his upcoming single "Shoot the Dog," which targets British policies
toward the Middle East. According to MTV.com, the video depicts
President George W. Bush as an "idiot" and Prime Minister Tony Blair
as his "lapdog." It also shows Michael in bed with Blair's wife,
Cherie ("Cherie, baby ... stay with me tonight / Let's have some fun
while Tony's stateside").</TE>
<TE>   Michael insists that the song has been taken out of context. It's
not an attack on America, he says, but a swipe at Blair's refusal to
discuss the issue of Iraq with the British populace.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   James L. Brooks, executive producer of "The Simpsons," will make a
cameo appearance on the show next season, along with stars such as

<HD>Another Bold Offer From Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recalling their experience at the Sundance Film Institute's
screenwriter workshop in Oaxaca, Mexico, the two collaborators
flinch.</LD>
<LD>   Director Gerardo Tort was a wide-eyed newcomer; screenwriter
Marina Stavenhagen had several scripts under her belt but was eager
to swap notes with respected colleagues. But instead of a warm
welcome, they were greeted with a cold reality: No one liked their
screenplay.</LD>
<LD>   Argentine screenwriter Martin Salinas ("Un Embrujo") said at the
time it was "a catastrophe" and for them to "start all over."</LD>
<TE>   Another experienced screenwriter gave them this bit of advice: "If
someone calls you a horse, call them an .... If 10 people call you a
horse, put on a saddle and give them a ride." "I was so depressed,"
recalled Stavenhagen, who has written several feature films in
Mexico. "I left there thinking, why am I doing this? I am going to
put up a taco stand in the corner instead."</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, they proved their critics wrong. Their film,
"De La Calle" ("Streeters"), a gripping drama about the life of
street children in Mexico City, swept the Mexican version of the
Academy Awards. They even had modest commercial success--grossing $5
million in two months at the Mexican box office last year--a
difficult feat considering the subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   "De La Calle" will have its United States debut at the Los Angeles
Latino Film Festival today.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a lesson in their experience at Sundance, it is to
stay true to a vision, said Tort.</TE>
<TE>   "We came home devastated," said Tort. "But we recovered and we
continued forward. We had to do what we thought was right and put our
soul into the project. What they did at Sundance was challenge us and
force us to show them what we could do."</TE>
<TE>   "De La Calle" is another in a string of uncompromising independent
films from Mexico. Hard-edged films like Alejandro Gonzalez
Inarritu's "Amores Perros" and Alfonso Cuaron's "Y Tu Mama Tambien"
have shown that making artistic yet difficult films can be successful
at the box office. These films have also demonstrated universal
appeal, having been picked up for distribution throughout the world
and, in the case of "Amores Perros," being nominated for an Academy
Award.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody thought it would be a commercial film," said "De La Calle"
producer Lillian Haugen. "But after 'Amores Perros' we knew that
people wanted to see more realistic cinema."</TE>
<TE>   But Haugen had a difficult time raising the $1.5 million she
needed to complete the film. They started their project at least two
years before "Amores Perros" was released. Like most independent
filmmakers, she began production without having all the financing in
place. Little by little, the money trickled in. In the end, the
film's financing came from at least half a dozen producers,
government agencies and even nonprofit organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Haugen, however, has not seen a return on her investment,
considering they spent almost $1 million on advertising and
publicity. It is difficult for films to generate a profit margin if
they are released only in Mexico. The international market is
crucial. In addition, Mexico's film industry does not have the same
financial resources as Hollywood and is only now beginning to see an
increase in private investing.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make alliances with distributors so they can sell
abroad," said Haugen. "We still don't recuperate from [releasing] in
our own territory. To spark investor interest we need to find
international distribution."</TE>
<TE>   Their biggest obstacle at home was convincing financiers that a
crew of inexperienced filmmakers could pull off a feature film.
Haugen and Tort were in advertising before going into feature
filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   It is perhaps indicative of Mexico's evolution as a democratic
society that they were able to make their film at all.</TE>
<TE>   When Luis Bunuel's 1951 classic, surreal drama about street
children, "Los Olvidados," was released, it was panned by critics,
and audiences shunned it. Mexico's intellectual and governing class
pounced on it as being unrealistic and painting an unflattering
picture of the country--which at the time was enjoying an
unparalleled boom.</TE>
<TE>   Bunuel flipped the romanticized notion of the noble pauper on its
head. He maintained that poverty does not induce kindness, rather
that it necessitates brutality and merciless survival skills. It was
not until the film was recognized at the Cannes Film Festival for its
vision and novelist Octavio Paz defended "Los Olvidados" publicly
that some in Mexico began to see merit in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years later, "De La Calle" was rewarded by the nation's
filmmaking elite, not only winning 11 Arieles at the Mexican film
awards but also best film at the Guadalajara Film Festival. However,
Tort said they did face problems with the country's ratings board.
Like Cuaron's "Y Tu Mama Tambien," the film was given a C rating,
meaning no one under 18 was allowed to see it. Tort believes that
rating shut out the audience he targeted. Unlike Cuaron, however, who
sued the ratings board, Tort kept quiet.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to make a big stink about it," he said. "I told the
[ratings board] my opinion."</TE>
<TE>   While Tort and Stavenhagen had "Los Olvidados" as a frame of
reference, they did not want to make comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   "I never intended this film to be a homage to him or to rip ["Los
Olvidados"] off," said Stavenhagen. "I wanted to tell yet another
story and give it another interpretation for today. There is nothing
original today--we all live with references to what already exists."</TE>
<TE>   To maintain authenticity, Tort and Stavenhagen dived into the
world of street children. For one year, they met almost daily with
groups of kids and social workers throughout Mexico City. They
established acting workshops for some of the street children so they
could play supporting roles.</TE>
<TE>   They heard horrifying stories of abuse and neglect. Most of the
children, said Tort, are on the street by choice.</TE>
<TE>   "The street gives them freedom and certain things they do not have
at home," he said. "It is a lifestyle option. If the street is awful,
imagine how horrible it must be where they came from. The movie is
very light compared to what they go through in real life."</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International estimates approximately 100 million children
worldwide live and work in the streets. These children are targets of
organ trafficking schemes, prostitution, abuse and "social cleansing"
sweeps that sometimes even have the support of local businesses. The
most infamous "cleansing" incident occurred in 1993, when a gang of
hooded off-duty policemen in Rio de Janeiro opened fire on more than
50 sleeping street children, according to Amnesty International.
Seven children and one adult died.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Tort did not want to make a documentary. The movie, based
on a play by Jesus Gonzalez Davila, chronicles the life of two street
kids, Rufino and Xochitl. Rufino has to contend with his violent
stepfather, a corrupt cop who is dealing drugs on the side. At the
same time, Rufino is searching for his real father.</TE>
<TE>   Xochitl is a single mother and former drug addict, who has no
visible means of supporting her baby. Together, they hope to flee to
Veracruz, a city by the sea, to escape their misery. Unhappily,
things do not work out as they planned.</TE>
<TE>   And that is where Stavenhagen and Tort faced the fiercest
criticism at the Sundance workshop. The ending was too sad--the kids'
stories were too morbid, they were told. Why not let the journey end
on a more uplifting note? Stavenhagen said she tried to change the
ending but that it turned the movie into a sappy melodrama.</TE>
<TE>   "What I loved about this story was the tragedy and not seeing a
way out," said Stavenhagen, who is working on a film with David Riker
("The City"). "Working with these street children was what did it for
me--there is no way out for these kids. Why am I going to lie?"</TE>
<TE>   Tort and Stavenhagen understand that the movie may be too harsh
for American audiences. But they reckon they made a film that was
honest, and if it doesn't sell abroad, so be it.</TE>
<TE>   "This criteria of what is commercial and what is not is very
relative," said Stavenhagen. "What works are good stories--whether or
not they have happy endings."</TE>

<HD>Ideas for Ground Zero: Where's the Imagination?</HD>
<DH>Six new designs for the World Trade Center site, unveiled
this week, lack any sense of the area's monumental importance; the
plans are called a starting point for discussion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For those who have been following the development process at ground
zero, the six master plans for the 16-acre site in Lower Manhattan
will offer no bold surprises. Bland and conventional, the proposals
represent the kind of no-nonsense, ho-hum design we have come to
expect from the average real estate development.</LD>
<LD>   The plans, produced by Beyer Blinder Belle Architects &amp; Planners,
were unveiled Tuesday by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., the
agency charged with developing the site. They will be presented today
at a town hall meeting at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in
Manhattan. The agency's intent is to use the plans as a starting
point for a more detailed public discussion over the site's future.</LD>
<LD>   The designs vary widely in detail, in particular in how they deal
with the memorial park--proposed sizes range from five to 10 acres.
Three proposals would build over the footprint of one of the former
Twin Towers, a move strenuously objected to by the families of the
victims and New York Gov. George E. Pataki.</LD>
<TE>   But ultimately, the designs reveal how fixed many of the initial
planning decisions seem to be. In each, significant portions of the
street grid that was removed in the 1970s would be rebuilt, dividing
the 16-acre site into smaller parcels. Part of West Street would be
replaced by an underground tunnel to connect the site to nearby
Battery Park City. About 11 million square feet of commercial office
space and 600,000 square feet of retail space would be replaced. And
all of the plans include a museum and one or two cultural venues.
Most of these ideas were formulated within months of the September
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   What the proposals lack is any sense of the site's importance as a
monumental expression of one of the most tragic events in the
nation's history. Instead, in applying conventional development
formulas to a site so loaded with symbolic meaning, the plans are the
equivalent of an act of psychological repression. They seek to forget
the past rather than come to terms with it. As such, they fail to
rise to the level of thoughtfulness that the public has a right to
expect.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal should be dismissed out of hand. In it, a new street
grid would cut through the site of the South Tower, which would be
partially covered with commercial buildings.</TE>
<TE>   In two other designs, a museum or pavilion would be built on the
site of one of the towers.</TE>
<TE>   These proposals are apt to encounter intense resistance from
victim's families, who have stated that they consider the footprints
of the Twin Towers sacred territory. Building on top of them--without
even acknowledging their presence through the design--is a startling
offense to memory.</TE>
<TE>   The three other proposals concentrate the bulk of commercial
development in a series of towers clustered along the site's northern
and western edges, with memorial parks located where the towers once
stood. All three set the museum along West Street, an obvious effort
to provide a cultural bridge between the site and Battery Park City
to the west.</TE>
<TE>   The most unusual plan calls for an oblong Beaux Arts-inspired park
that connects to a grand boulevard extending all the way down to the
tip of Battery Park City. The park's formal layouts suggest the kind
of imperial grandeur associated with Washington rather than New York,
and it seems particularly inappropriate for a site that is more about
mourning than civic power.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, all six designs mirror the kind of New Urbanist
thinking that has dominated conventional development design for a
decade. Wholly unimaginative, they seek to replicate the fine-grained
fabric of traditional cities, but on a massive scale. The result is
theme park architecture.</TE>
<TE>   When the plans diverge from that model, they usually tend toward
the bizarre. In one proposal, a multilevel public walkway would flank
the memorial park on four sides. The arcade has no discernable
relationship to the various buildings, and it serves to isolate the
park from its surrounding context.</TE>
<TE>   In another, an elevated pedestrian deck would span West Street,
linking the site to the upper level of the World Financial Center's
winter garden, effectively draining pedestrian life from the street.</TE>
<TE>   What all of these proposals share is an inability to resolve the
colliding interests of developers and the public. The LMDC has been
under intense pressure to come up with a final master plan for the
site by December. Yet it has yet to determine which parts of the site
should be given over to commercial development and which should
remain an inviolate part of the public realm.</TE>
<TE>   Developers and businessmen have been lobbying the agency to
rebuild as much commercial and retail space as possible to buttress
downtown's flagging real estate market. The Port Authority, which
owns the land, also has a vested interest in the plan's commercial
component, which is expected to generate more than $120 million a
year in revenue for the agency. It is in its interest to begin
reconstruction as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The public, meanwhile, expects a plan that will reflect the pain
it now associates with the site. It's becoming increasingly apparent
that the public requires more time to absorb and understand the scope
of the catastrophe. Without that time, it may be impossible to find a
meaningful expression of how best to rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than try to come to terms with such complex issues, the
LMDC has chosen to adopt the kind of public-private development
process that has become the primary vehicle for large-scale
development in most American cities. They have sought the advice of
mainstream developers and the type of architects that typically serve
their interests instead of opening up the process to a variety of
urban thinkers.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the September attacks, for example, Larry Silverstein,
the developer who holds the lease to the World Trade Center site,
retained Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill to develop its own master plan
for the site. Similarly, Brookfield Properties Corp., which owns the
nearby World Financial Center, commissioned Cooper, Robertson &amp;
Partners to develop its own scheme. Both plans have had a significant
impact in shaping the current designs.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a series of proposals that neatly parcels off the
site's competing interests into separate zones, commercial on one
side, memorial on the other. The inclusion of housing as a major
component of the plan, an idea that has been suggested by a number of
outside urban planners, has been dropped because it would require a
compromise, mainly on the part of the development community.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to meet its December deadline, the LMDC may end up
simply acceding part of the site to commercial developers. The agency
will then have more time to turn its attention to the project's
public components--the memorial park, the museum and the cultural
buildings. In a best-case scenario, it will organize a competition
and invite the world's most celebrated architects to take part.</TE>
<TE>   This would be a compromise solution. It would effectively
guarantee the creation of a cluster of unimaginative towers at one
end of the site.</TE>
<TE>   But it may avoid a worse tragedy: allowing a substandard design
team to rush to complete a rigid master plan, and then asking
architects and artists to plug in their designs for the memorial and
one or two cultural venues.</TE>
<TE>   It would certainly preclude the kind of complex, imaginative urban
project that could have risen to the high standards that the site
demands. At best, it will produce a development similar to the nearby
Battery Park City, with one or two exceptional architectural
landmarks lost in a sea of conventional buildings.</TE>
<TE>   That would be acceptable anywhere else. But a decade from now when
the reconstruction of ground zero is finally complete, it will exist
as a symbol of the best this country can produce, of its most lasting
values as a culture with immense power and influence on the world.
Those responsible for its development would do well to remember that
simple fact.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time there were three little girls who went to the
federal penitentiary. But a covert government program took them away
from all that, and now they work for you and me.</LD>
<LD>   Having flashbacks to "Charlie's Angels," that '70s show
responsible for the Farrah haircut, the golden age of David Doyle and
the ascendance of jiggle-vision? It's no coincidence, because the
campy comedy-action series "She Spies," premiering tonight at 10 on
NBC, seeks to evoke its predecessor and simultaneously poke fun at
it.</LD>
<LD>   Natasha Henstridge, Kristen Miller and Natashia Williams play a
trio of career criminals whose ticket out of prison is to work as
undercover agents.</LD>
<TE>   Cassie (Henstridge) is a con artist extraordinaire; D.D. (Miller)
is a naif but also a brilliant computer hacker; and Shane (Williams)
is a thief and martial arts expert.</TE>
<TE>   Their "Bosley" is Jack (Carlos Jacott; with all the Natashas on
the show, it's a shame his name isn't Boris), a government operative
who hands out the assignments.</TE>
<TE>   First up: protecting a former presidential candidate ("Spin
City's" Barry Bostwick) from assassination while he launches a career
hosting a goofy talk show.</TE>
<TE>   It's no simple task, considering that this guy's sleazoid behavior
can give anyone immediate grounds for justifiable homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, "She Spies" offers plenty of fight sequences, plot
twists and the like, but that's not really the point. Rather, the
show is laden with jokes riffing on "Charlie's Angels," "Ally
McBeal," "V.I.P.," the entertainment industry and even "She Spies"
itself.</TE>
<TE>   It breaks the fourth wall, directly addressing viewers, as often
as its tightly outfitted heroines deliver swift kicks to the bad
guys' groins.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, "She Spies" proves more entertaining than one might
expect, given the unusual deal struck to get it on network television
in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   NBC signed up for only the first four episodes as a "sneak
preview," and the plan is to continue the show in first-run
syndication come September.</TE>
<TE>   As a lead-in to tonight's premiere, NBC is airing "Species," the
1995 science-fiction film that made model-turned-actress Henstridge
famous.</TE>
<TE>   In short, it would appear the network doesn't have the greatest
confidence in the show, and it's easy to see why.</TE>
<TE>   The makers of it could have focused a bit more on the quality of
the humor than the quantity; for every joke that works, it seems as
if there is one that tries too hard.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, this trio's looks can kill, but sometimes the lines simply
wipe out.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "She Spies" is one of those guilty pleasures like FX's "Son
of the Beach," light summer fare that doesn't take itself seriously,
a fluff of jiggle TV with a niggling self-conscience.</TE>
<TE>   "She Spies" premieres tonight at 10 on NBC. The network has rated
it TV-PG (may not be suitable for young children). The show will
premiere in syndication the week of Sept. 16.</TE>

<LD>Explorations of identity under a clothesline, dance parodies that
illuminate the performers' attitudes toward their work and one
another: Choreographer Arianne MacBean is on her favorite turf with
"This Happened," a new hourlong example of what she calls "smart
dance," performed by her Big Show Company at Highways Performance
Space in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   At the premiere on Thursday, the nine-part piece began with five
women mixing mundane tasks under that clothesline with poetic
longings but soon reached its epicenter--a poem by C.K. Williams
about a young woman who threw away her life because of the lack of
true feeling or authenticity in it.</LD>
<LD>   Images of that woman teetering on the brink of suicide kept
recurring in somber modern dance solos, punctuated by depictions of
authenticity lost and found. These depictions included outrageous
lampoons of professional corps dancing--everything from ballet to
commercial jazz--that highlighted the individuality that dancers
sacrifice for cookie-cutter uniformity.</LD>
<TE>   However, a look at backstage relationships helped reinforce the
sense of camaraderie that MacBean portrayed as the saving grace in
women's lives--a reason to keep going no matter how meaningless or
degrading the task.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most complex choreographic vision came in a somber
duet for Rande Dorn and Miriam Kramer, each of them feeling the same
feelings and dancing the same steps but unaware of each other:
separated by one of Ernie Avila's geometric set units that served as
walls and platforms during the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Isolated, restless yet deeply connected in ways the audience could
understand even if they could not, these women represented all those
who desperately need the lifeline of friendship or sisterhood so
feelingly celebrated in this thoughtful, humane feminist panorama.</TE>
<TE>   Other dancers in the performance included Robin Conrad, Elizabeth
Hoefner and MacBean herself. Percussionist Mike Robbins composed and
performed the music for three sections.</TE>

<DH>Conductors Seiji Ozawa and Kurt Masur leave the podium--and
uncertainty lingers for their successors</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Amid a sea of musicians all in white, Seiji Ozawa said goodbye to the
Boston Symphony at the Tanglewood Festival in the Berkshires on a
warm afternoon last Sunday. Thursday night, it was Kurt Masur's turn
to part with his New York Philharmonic audience, at a 75th birthday
gala sponsored by the Lincoln Center Festival and given in a
colorfully decorated Avery Fisher Hall. With these two prominent
conductors stepping down from the helms of America's oldest
orchestras the same week (Masur's last concerts as music director of
the New York Philharmonic are tonight and Sunday at Tanglewood), an
era ends.</LD>
<LD>   For Ozawa's sentimental final performance, he asked the audience
to sing along with the Tanglewood Festival Chorus in Randall
Thompson's "Alleluia," which students who attend the Tanglewood Music
Center training program traditionally sing at its opening exercises
(as a young Ozawa did when he first arrived to study there in 1960).
Masur's moving final encore was Bach's Air on the G String. During
it, he dramatically walked off stage as the New York strings
continued to play with exquisite beauty.</LD>
<TE>   Surrounded by the sympathetic, cheering music lovers who showed up
in large numbers for these events, even a cynic could momentarily
forget that the long tenures of both music directors have been
controversial. The New York Philharmonic forced Masur out sooner than
he would have liked, as he has complained to the media. For years,
the Boston Symphony fended off calls from critics (and, I'm told,
from orchestra players as well) to remove Ozawa.</TE>
<TE>   The situations in Boston and New York seem to have little in
common, the conductors and their circumstances hardly comparable. The
facile, poetic Ozawa, who remained in Boston an epic 29 years, has
the reputation for being a lightweight, if likable, musician who did
not do enough to maintain the orchestra's high standards.</TE>
<TE>   But he's always been popular with the public. The attendance
figures for "Celebrating Seiji"--the Tanglewood weekend, which
included Ozawa conducting the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra (a
student ensemble), a Saturday night celebrity gala (with John
Williams, Mstislav Rostropovich, Gil Shaham, Jessye Norman, Marcus
Roberts and Steven Spielberg) and the Sunday BSO program--had
attendance figures of more than 41,000, and it raised about $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   The serious, earnest Masur served in New York an impressive 12
seasons (only Zubin Mehta lasted longer as music director of a
famously difficult orchestra). Unlike Ozawa, Masur brought a stern
military discipline to players known for their pugnacity. A devoted
classicist, Masur gradually won begrudging admiration in this
ruthless city. And his image was burnished after Sept. 11, especially
when he performed what was by all accounts a profoundly intent
performance of Brahms' "German Requiem" in the wake of the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ozawa nor Masur lacks vitality or vision. Both have
dutifully promoted new music, and American music, up to a point. Both
are highly energetic. Yet neither brought the imagination or
inspiration of a contemporary sensibility to their orchestras, which
are increasingly perceived as culturally irrelevant. When people talk
about the dispirited state of classical music these days, they need
only point to these two famed, distinguished East Coast orchestras as
a prime examples. (Typically, the blinkered Eastern music
establishment and media still show only a begrudging awareness that
orchestral leadership has moved to the West Coast.)</TE>
<TE>   Sad to say, the Ozawa and Masur farewell concerts weren't very
exciting or very interesting. In Tanglewood, Ozawa led an
indifferently played performance of "Symphonie Fantastique" that
lacked the attention to detail, textural transparency or careful
instrumental balances necessary to reveal the visionary quality of
Berlioz's orchestral writing. Its high point was a mildly climactic
bacchanalian frenzy at the end. For the second half of the program
Ozawa conducted a satisfyingly straightforward account of Beethoven's
20-minute Choral Fantasy; its finest moments were Peter Serkin's
transfixingly eloquent piano solos.</TE>
<TE>   Masur's birthday bash, which was televised and good-naturedly
hosted by Beverly Sills, was a glorified pops program consisting
mainly of single movements from full works. This was highly unusual
for so high-minded a music director. But Masur, who was known to
court favor with the musicians in battles against management, used
Thursday's concert as an opportunity to pay tribute to the undeniable
brilliance of the individual players in his orchestra, by featuring
them in movements from such works as Brahms' Double Concerto, Bach's
Concerto for Two Violins and Mendelssohn's "Midsummer Night's Dream."</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble playing from his musical muscle car was equally
spectacular but mercilessly hard driven. The one recent work, a
Fandango that featured solo trumpet and trombone by New Jersey
composer Joseph Turrin was trivial. Ravel's "Bolero," which closed
the formal part of the program, sounded altogether militaristic
(hearing the machine-gun-precise drumming, my instinct was to duck).</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, Ozawa and Masur each programmed Leonard Bernstein's
"Candide" Overture as openers, but neither conducted it. Ozawa turned
it over to his assistant conductor, Federico Cortese, to begin his
Friday program. The New York Philharmonic performed it without a
conductor, which has become a tradition since Bernstein's death a
dozen years ago.</TE>
<TE>   And nothing could better indicate just how strongly Bernstein's
legacy haunts the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony, the
two orchestras with which he had the closest relationship. Both bands
now look to Americans to attract new audiences and make their
institutions matter more in culturally changing times.</TE>
<TE>   Lorin Maazel, who takes over the New York Philharmonic in
September, was hastily hired. He is a brilliant technician, an
eccentric interpreter and a conductor with a history of making
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   James Levine, on the other hand, didn't exactly leap at the Boston
Symphony offer--his hiring was a long, drawn-out affair. He is a
magnificent and versatile musician, but there remain unanswered
questions about his health (he has looked as if he conducts in pain
lately) and about how deep his commitment will be to Boston and
Tanglewood. He doesn't begin for two long years.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder, then, that the farewells to Ozawa and Masur were so
fondly nostalgic. The future is anything but certain.</TE>

<HD>'Arli$$' Opens Door to Gay Athlete</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His ambition soars higher than a Sammy Sosa homer, and his ego is
bigger than Shaq's basketball shoes. But sports agent Arliss Michaels
is a dependable advisor and friend to the athletes he represents.</LD>
<LD>   Arliss shows what he's made of on Sunday's episode of "Arli$$"
(9:30 p.m., HBO), when a major-league pitcher client confides that
he's gay and wants to live openly.</LD>
<LD>   The episode was completed before a comment by New York Mets
manager Bobby Valentine and an item in a New York Post gossip column
spurred speculation in late May that a ballplayer was about to go
public regarding his sexuality. The repercussions of such an event
are thoughtfully addressed here by writer Chrisanne Eastwood,
director Jonathan Fink and series creator Robert Wuhl.</LD>
<TE>   As so often happens, Arliss (Wuhl) doesn't at first notice what's
going on because he's let his head get so big that his eyes have
swollen shut. Dreaming of gold-record glory, he envisions a "We Are
the World"-type project to raise money for high school athletic
programs. Meanwhile, the pitcher (played by former "Melrose Place"
hunk Grant Show) meets and falls for an openly gay rock star (Robin
Atkin Downes), whom Arliss pursues for the recording.</TE>
<TE>   Guest appearances are a regular feature of "Arli$$," and the
lineup for this episode is particularly inspired. Arliss turns for
advice to former Dodgers and Padres player Billy Bean, who came out
after he left the majors. His comments, said to be his personal
views, infuse life experience into this culturally complex issue.</TE>
<TE>   On a lighter note, musician Bruce Hornsby and Olympic figure
skater Tara Lipinski are among those who show up for the recording
session.</TE>

<HD>The Rap Sheet Grows With Mystikal's Arrest</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* The top-selling rapper joins a growing list of
musicians accused of crimes, including his Jive Records labelmate R.
Kelly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The arrest of Mystikal this week in Louisiana on sexual assault and
extortion charges adds yet another entry to a list that has reached a
dizzying length: rappers whose gritty street rhymes seem to echo in
their personal lives and in the nation's courthouses. The arrest also
endangers the career of one of the genre's most potent stars.</LD>
<LD>   The funk-minded rap of the raspy-voiced Mystikal has sold 6.1
million albums in the U.S. with hits such as the raunchy "Shake Ya
Ass" and "Danger (Been So Long)," which made the New Orleans rhymer a
staple star of urban radio and MTV. His persona has been as a
handsome, often humorous stage performer whose work also has flashes
of social commentary and gravitas, such as the song "Murderer," about
the slaying of his sister by her boyfriend.</LD>
<LD>   Mystikal, whose real name is Michael Tyler, surrendered to police
on Thursday for his alleged attack on a woman in his home. The woman
has told police that the rapper demanded sex from her and threatened
to turn her into police for check fraud against his bank account if
she did not submit. The rapper was arrested with two other men who
allegedly came to his home and took turns raping the 40-year-old
woman.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted of aggravated rape, Mystikal could face a life
sentence. A conviction on the extortion charge, meanwhile, has a
potential prison term of one to 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Those are numbing numbers for a man more accustomed to counting
his hit songs and money. They present a grim situation for Jive
Records, one of the great success stories in the music industry in
recent years that now has two of its biggest stars, R. Kelly and
Mystikal, facing sex-related felony charges that may injure their
career viability even if the cases end in acquittals. R&amp;B star Kelly
is charged with child pornography in his hometown of Chicago. A Jive
spokeswoman referred inquiries on Friday to Michael Guy, the rapper's
attorney, who did not return calls by press time.</TE>
<TE>   Mystikal's music and success have put him among the ranks of top
rappers, and now his criminal quandary lumps him in with the genre's
all-stars who have seen their names on court dockets and accused of
violent acts: Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur,
DMX, Eminem, Juvenile and dozens of others.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't hurt most of them, really, there's something in hip-hop
for some reason that fans take the music, not the person," says
Emmanuel "eMan" Coquia, music director for KPWR-FM (105.9), which
counts Mystikal among the higher tiers of its playlist stars.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rappers have walked away from their brushes with the
law with little or no damage to their fan base and, to some cynical
appraisals, may have even enhanced their street credibility. Is it
easier for rappers to rehabilitate their image after criminal cases
than it is for other celebrities?</TE>
<TE>   "That question presumes a rehabilitation is required," says Fred
Davis, a New York entertainment attorney whose clients include Busta
Rhymes, Missy Elliott and Linkin Park. "If you are in 'N Sync or you
are a G- or PG-orientated artist, yes, absolutely, a parent might
think twice before allowing their 13-year-old to buy a particular CD
[by an artist facing criminal charges]. But the demographics for a
rock or rap consumer are older and are less affected by it."</TE>
<TE>   There is a downside that rappers are not immune to, however. "We
do live in a day and age that when people read a headline they
presume guilt, which is terrible," Davis said. "And if you are a
celebrity you get that headline."</TE>
<TE>   While many of the rappers who veer in lyrics to violence and
gangsta imagery are often the ones who find their lives imitating
their art, Mystikal is known more for party music. He came up as an
underground sensation as part of Master P's No Limit legion of
Southern rappers, but the thug life imagery of that collective did
not define the protege as he went on to Jive.</TE>
<TE>   Last month he told reporters he was recording "the Prince of the
South," a new album he expected to have in stores by year's end.</TE>

<HD>Tangled Web Awaits New CEO of AOL</HD>
<DH>Internet: Analysts say the division's chief will have to
move quickly and quietly to address pressing problems such as sagging
ad sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Just one day after a shake-up at AOL Time Warner Inc. handed power
back to the old guard, analysts offered this piece of advice for the
as-yet-unnamed executive who will take over the flagging Internet
division: Keep your mouth shut.</LD>
<LD>   Any new executive hired to lead the faltering America Online unit
must move quickly to address pressing problems such as slowing
subscriber growth, a sluggish conversion to high-speed data
connections and sagging Internet ad sales.</LD>
<LD>   But over-promising gains to shareholders was as much the problem
behind AOL as any of the other challenges that still face it, several
analysts said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   And Robert W. Pittman, who resigned under pressure Thursday as the
parent company's chief operating officer and head of AOL, was blamed
for doing just that. Instead of results, investors got "quarter after
quarter after quarter of having to lower expectations," A.G. Edwards
analyst Michael A. Kupinski said.</TE>
<TE>   Although AOL Time Warner's stock took another throttling
Friday--as did the overall market--some analysts are predicting that
the company will ride out its current woes.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch's Jessica Reif Cohen hailed the promotion of Time
Inc. Chief Executive Don Logan to the new post of chairman of the
Media and Communications Group, overseeing America Online, Time Inc.,
Time Warner Cable, HBO, Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive
Video unit.</TE>
<TE>   Under Logan, Cohen noted, Time Inc.'s magazine group has grown to
25% of the U.S. magazine market share and 41 consecutive quarters of
growth in EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization--a common earnings yardstick for media firms.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the subscription- and advertising-based operating model,
the AOL segment resembles the magazine business model," Cohen said in
a note to investors Friday, adding: "We believe Mr. Logan will be
instrumental in leveraging traditional advertisers to the AOL
platform."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, AOL Time Warner's shares fell to a 52-week low of
$11.58, down 87 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. At that level,
analysts said, the market is recognizing only the Time Warner
entertainment assets and according zero value to the world's biggest
Internet service, with 34 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   "People are throwing AOL out with the bath water," Kupinski said.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean that the Internet unit's problems are trivial,
however. "Pittman's departure before a replacement was found
underlines the tensions within the company and the complexity of
turning around the online unit," said First Albany analyst Youssef
Squali.</TE>
<TE>   He said it's important for the company to line up cable TV
partners offering additional high-speed connections for America
Online's customers by the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Squali rates AOL Time Warner stock a "strong buy," arguing
that the shares are "significantly undervalued." Time Warner's assets
alone should yield a per-share price in the mid-teens, Squali said.
And if investors valued America Online the same way they value
no-frills Internet service provider EarthLink Inc.--at about eight
times this year's estimated EBITDA--AOL itself ought to be worth
$3.60 a share, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street research departments like AOL Time Warner a lot better
than most investors do. Of 27 media analysts surveyed by earnings
tracker Thomson First Call, 18 rated AOL Time Warner a "strong buy,"
research director Charles Hill said. Put another way, the company
scored a 1.5 on First Call's 1-to-5 scale of analyst recommendations,
while the average Standard &amp; Poor's 500 company rated a weaker 2.2,
Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Kupinski and his AG Edwards colleagues won praise two years ago
for spotting early signs of an advertising recession and warning
investors away from ad-dependent firms such as AOL.</TE>
<TE>   But today, he thinks advertising may be on the brink of a
turnaround, although the rebound won't show up soon in the online
sector. Advertising and commerce revenues fell 31% at America Online
in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, and Kupinski
expects about a 40% drop for the second quarter, to be reported
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The best time to own advertising companies is a little ahead of an
economic upswing, and now may be the time for AOL, said Kupinski, who
does not personally own AOL Time Warner shares.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Investigating Alleged Mercedes-Benz Price-Fixing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler said the Justice Department is conducting a criminal
investigation into allegations that the company's Mercedes-Benz
subsidiaries participated in a price-fixing scheme among New
York-area dealers.</LD>
<LD>   The world's fifth-largest car maker said in a filing Friday with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that the case is connected to
a 1999 proposed class-action lawsuit against two Mercedes-Benz units,
Mercedes-Benz USA and Mercedes-Benz Manhattan Inc. They were served
with grand jury subpoenas in May, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old lawsuit was filed in federal court in Newark, N.J.,
on behalf of motorists who bought new Mercedes-Benzes. It accuses 27
dealers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and Mercedes-Benz USA
of conspiring since 1992 "to artificially maintain prices," said
Jeffrey W. Herrmann, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of DaimlerChrysler fell $3.90, or 8%, to $43.65 on the New
York Stock Exchange as part of a broad Wall Street sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a massive overreaction," said analyst David Healy of Burnham
Securities Inc. "It's just a symptom of the psychotic nature of the
market right now." He doesn't own DaimlerChrysler shares or have a
formal rating for the stock.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is based on allegations by a dealer whose franchise
the company tried to revoke for poor performance, DaimlerChrysler
spokeswoman Donna Boland said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is without merit," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes-Benz USA said, "Once the facts are brought out, it will
be clear that there was no wrongdoing." The Justice Department would
not comment.</TE>
<TE>   In October, DaimlerChrysler was fined $73 million by the European
Commission for refusing to sell cars to Germans who shopped abroad in
search of lower prices. A European Commission spokesman, Michael
Tscherny, said in Brussels that he was unaware of any price-fixing
investigation similar to the U.S. probe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Honda Motor Co. paid more than $400 million to settle
suits by its U.S. dealers that it sought kickbacks in return for
shipping them hot-selling Accords and Preludes. A Cleveland Honda
dealership filed a new suit this week, resurrecting the 20-year-old
bribery claims that led to mail fraud convictions of almost a dozen
executives of Honda's U.S. unit.</TE>

<HD>Disney May Add 2nd China Park</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Sources say the media giant, which has been
increasing its international interests, is planning a Disneyland
development in Shanghai.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co., eager to expand its reach in the world's largest
untapped market, has taken the first step toward building a theme
park in mainland China.</LD>
<LD>   Disney has signed a nonbinding letter of intent with Shanghai's
city government to develop a Disneyland theme park in Shanghai, the
emerging commercial hub of China, according to sources familiar with
the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed park is part of an overall strategy by Disney to
expand its theme park business internationally as its domestic
markets mature.</LD>
<TE>   The park would be Disney's second in China. The company is
building a park in Hong Kong, which is set to open in 2006. Disney
also has two parks in Tokyo. The latest one, DisneySea, opened last
summer and is doing brisk business.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, Disney added a second theme park outside Paris this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials hope the proposed Shanghai park will be open in
time for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, although it's unclear
whether Disney would be able to do so in such a short time frame.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the date, Disney probably would reap broad benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "It [the park] will serve as a platform to promote all things
Disney in China--whether it's movies, DVDs or TV shows in
syndication," said David Miller, a media analyst with Sanders Morris
Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Disney representatives declined to comment on the preliminary park
agreement, saying only that the company was having ongoing dialogues
with China about its various businesses there.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made no definitive decisions or commitments at this
time," said Walt Disney Parks and Resorts spokeswoman Leslie Goodman.
"We have always stated that two parks in China could be a possibility
in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Goodman said the company is focused for now on opening Hong Kong
Disneyland, which beat Shanghai in lobbying for the first Chinese
Disneyland in 1999. Some Hong Kong officials worry that a rival park
could cut into their much-needed tourism business.</TE>
<TE>   Financial terms of the proposed Shanghai venture remain unclear.
Sources said the city probably would pay for much of the construction
costs, as was the case in Hong Kong. In that project, Disney is
contributing $315 million for a 43% equity stake, while taxpayers are
paying $2.9 billion for the park and accompanying infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is not alone in seeing gold in China.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola Inc., IBM Corp., AT&amp;T Corp., Ford Motor Co. and General
Motors Corp. have made significant investments in China. On the
entertainment side, rival Universal Studios also has been studying
various sites in China for a new theme park. Viacom Inc.'s MTV cable
channel has had a presence in China for several years.</TE>
<TE>   The allure is clear: China has a population of 1.3 billion people
with a growing middle class. Rising incomes and a reduction in the
average workweek also have created more demand for the apolitical
family entertainment that is Disney's trademark.</TE>
<TE>   With as many as 16 million people in Shanghai, the park will not
be short on customers, experts say. "Disney will get a lot of
business out of this, that's for darn sure," said James McNeill
Stancill, a professor of finance at USC's Marshall School of Business
who has special expertise on China. "It's great for Disney and for
China."</TE>
<TE>   For China, which recently joined the World Trade Organization, a
second Disneyland park would be an important symbol of the nation's
eagerness to open its economy to Western investment.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has built a significant presence in China since its foray
into the country in 1986 with a roll-out of merchandise and the
launching of "The Mickey and Donald Show," a half-hour program on
Chinese television. "The Dragon Club," a children's television
program featuring mostly Disney cartoons, is viewed by more than 60
million households in China.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond television, Disney has published nearly 200 titles in China
and has a biweekly magazine, Mickey Mouse, with a circulation of
250,000. In the last five years, Disney has released to theaters "The
Lion King," "Toy Story," "Mulan," "Tarzan," "Dinosaur" and "Pearl
Harbor," plus more than 100 Chinese-language titles on DVD. Disney
also has opened about 200 Mickey's Corners and other retail areas
within stores.</TE>
<TE>   Disney plans to open more stores and has commitments to launch
additional television programs. In Hong Kong, Disney has been pushing
to start a full-time Disney Channel.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion follows the classic business development pattern
that Walt Disney used to convert his fledgling film studio into an
entertainment juggernaut: Establish a loyal following for characters
through television programs and movies, roll out merchandise based on
the characters, then create theme parks that are 3-D versions of the
characters.</TE>
<TE>   Doing business in China, however, carries some risks for Disney
and others. Hollywood studios, for example, have struggled to market
and distribute movies and television programs. Among the obstacles:
piracy, red tape and a government whose ideology often has been at
odds with Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Disney and Sony Pictures Entertainment were temporarily banned
from China's film market after releasing movies about the Dalai Lama.
Disney also stumbled with its adaptation of the Chinese folk tale
"Mulan."</TE>
<TE>   The movie was hurt by criticism that its characters were too
Western and by rules that restricted its release in China.</TE>

<HD>Illegal DVDs of New Movies Sold on EBay</HD>
<DH>Copyrights: Studios worry about bootlegs of 'Men in Black
II,' 'Reign of Fire' and other films moving to legitimate mass
marketplaces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sign of digital piracy reaching the masses, illegal DVD copies
of recently released movies are showing up in legitimate marketplaces
such as online auction house EBay Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Bootlegged versions of "Men in Black II," "Reign of Fire" and
"Lilo &amp; Stitch" have been sold on the auction site in recent days.
Unlike digital movie copies downloaded from the Internet, the DVDs
require no special equipment or expertise to obtain or watch. All
that is needed is a free EBay account and a DVD player.</LD>
<LD>   "EBay creates a much larger arena for pirates to sell their goods
than historically they have had," said Mark Litvack, director of
legal affairs and anti-piracy for the Motion Picture Assn. "The fact
that it's worldwide is especially troublesome."</LD>
<TE>   The MPA notifies EBay and other online auction houses when it
spots illegal copies being sold. If the auctions are deemed
illegitimate, EBay officials said, they are taken down and the
sellers can be expelled.</TE>
<TE>   But numerous auction postings slip through the cracks. At least 42
copies of "Men in Black II" and 43 of "Lilo and Stitch" have been
sold on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are minuscule, but they warn of possibly much larger
problems for film copyright holders in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "This will only grow," said analyst P.J. McNealy of research firm
GartnerG2. "As people learn that for $20 they can get a copy of a
film that is still in the theaters, a number of them will certainly
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Sellers of the bootlegs have little chance of being brought before
the law. Litvack said that in Asia, actions by the MPA have resulted
in jail terms for some offenders, but he could not recall a similar
fate befalling any offender in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the EBay sellers of just-released films make a point of
describing themselves as "U.S. seller."</TE>
<TE>   The packaging of the bootlegs has gotten sophisticated, judging by
the pictures of the items posted on EBay. Some include lavish
graphics not only on the package fronts but even stamped onto the
disc.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them are looking quite realistic," McNealy said. "The
obvious aim is to convince the buyer that they are the real thing."</TE>
<TE>   Some bootleggers made modifications to increase sales. One copy of
"Men in Black II" was billed as a "special edition" for younger
viewers that "has been modified for small children to view it, so any
PG-13 word is taken out."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the DVDs are billed as imports, and they might be, said
Litvack, but not legitimate ones. He said nowhere in the world have
legitimate DVDs been released for such recent films as "Men in Black
II" and "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   That's not always the case, however. "When 'Crouching Tiger' was
released in this country, there were already legal DVDs of it in
China," said lawyer Jay Monahan, who heads EBay's Verified Rights
Owners program, which investigates auction items that could pose
copyright problems.</TE>
<TE>   Monahan said EBay does initiate some investigations of movie
copies, but it normally acts only after being notified of a possible
violation by the MPA or an individual studio.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't attempt to become experts on what might or might not be
an infringement," Monahan said. "But if we are notified and see that
an illegal copy is being sold, we do take it down."</TE>
<TE>   Sellers found to be selling illegal copies usually get a warning
for the first offense and then can be suspended for the second,
Monahan said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the sellers--who posted an auction for "Spiderman, Road To
Perdition ETC DVDs!"--was not interested in selling anything on the
site. Clicking on the auction brought up a message, "There is no item
actually for sale," and an advertisement for his online store, at
which numerous bootlegs were available.</TE>
<TE>   That auction was brought down by EBay after only an hour, but
other versions of it popped up later.</TE>
<TE>   Bootlegs, in addition to being illegal, pose other possible
problems for buyers. "You are not sure what you are buying. The
quality could be terrible," Litvack said.</TE>
<TE>   The discs often are not direct digital copies but instead are
struck from a video made by a camera aimed at the screen during a
regular showing of the movie. Sometimes heads bob up into the
picture.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the so-called DVDs are actually VCDs, which are highly
compressed digital copies of poor quality.</TE>
<TE>   That's what an Alabama man got when he paid $29.99 for a copy of
"Star Wars Episode II," even though the seller billed it as a full
DVD. The man, who asked that his name not be used, had to make
several adjustments to his player to get the disc to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally got it to work, but not in color," he said. "But the
sound was good."</TE>
<TE>   The item was well-packaged, with detailed graphics, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it looked like a commercial thing. Nothing indicated it
was a copy."</TE>
<TE>   He said he thought, at the time he made the bid, that the disc had
been imported from somewhere in the world where it was legitimately
for sale.</TE>
<TE>   He was not surprised, however, to learn that it was a fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "If you work at it and search hard enough on EBay, you can find
just about anything you want," he said.</TE>

<HD>Carriers Slash Fares as UAL Posts Big Loss</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Although it is good news for travelers, the move
baffles analysts. United's parent reports a net loss of $341million
in quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A nationwide fare sale broke out Friday even as United Airlines
parent UAL Corp. posted a huge second-quarter loss, capping a
$1.4-billion total quarterly loss for the major carriers that they
largely blame on falling ticket prices. UAL and other airline stocks
plunged as a result.</LD>
<LD>   Near-bankrupt US Airways Group Inc. launched the sale Thursday,
and industry leader American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., then
expanded the promotion to almost its entire domestic system, analysts
said.</LD>
<LD>   American's move then was matched by United, Northwest Airlines
Corp., Continental Airlines Inc. and others, with prices cut 35% or
more depending on the route.</LD>
<TE>   The sale, although good news for consumers, indicates that
American and others aren't pleased with advance bookings going into
the fall. But it left some analysts baffled about why airlines are
slashing fares--even for a brief period--when they're suffering
enormous losses. The current sale requires tickets to be bought by
Thursday for travel before Oct. 1 on domestic routes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is bizarre," said Bob Jones, an analyst with the online
travel site OneTravel.com. "For consumers, it means a temporary gain,
but eventually some of these carriers are going to go belly up if
this nonsense doesn't stop." American declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   United's round-trip fare between Los Angeles and New York dropped
to $316 from $509, and its Los Angeles-to-San Francisco fare fell to
$136 round-trip from $154, said spokesman Chris Brathwaite. The sale
fares require a seven- or 14-day advance purchase and a Saturday
night stay and exclude various fees and taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The big airlines routinely match low fares posted by discount
carriers on select routes, but they've infrequently joined in a
systemwide price cut in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The sale is ironic for an industry loudly complaining that its
leisure ticket prices are too cheap because of sluggish travel demand
in the face of the weak economy and the aftermath of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, for example, AMR Chairman Donald Carty cited a
15-year low in average leisure fares as a key reason his company had
a $495-million loss in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   American also has helped lead several recent efforts to boost
leisure fares by $20 per round-trip ticket, only to rescind the
increase after other airlines--usually Northwest--failed to follow
suit.</TE>
<TE>   But Northwest and the others say they have no choice but to match
rivals' price cuts. With travel still down from a year ago, they
can't afford to lose passengers to other airlines. That's especially
true for airlines such as American and United, which heavily depend
on business traffic, which now is so depressed.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's chief executive, Jack Creighton, likewise cited "the weak
revenue environment" at United as a key reason UAL lost $392 million,
or $6.99 per diluted share, before a one-time gain in the three
months ended June 30. Including the gain, UAL had a net loss of $341
million, and its revenue tumbled 19% to $3.8 billion from $4.7
billion.</TE>
<TE>   UAL also is staring at a "significant deficit for the year"
because business and leisure travel, which started to pick up in the
first quarter of this year, now "have stalled," Creighton said in a
statement from UAL's headquarters in Elk Grove Village, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The grim outlook added to the stock market's sell-off Friday. UAL
shares plummeted $1.48, or 20%, to $6.05, and AMR skidded 86 cents,
or 7%, to $12.01, both on the New York Stock Exchange. The American
Stock Exchange's index of airline shares lost 3.51 points, or 6%, to
52.92.</TE>
<TE>   UAL and US Airways are both seeking bailouts in the form of
federal loan guarantees. U.S. officials already have given
conditional approval to US Airways' petition for a $900-million
guarantee, and UAL is requesting a $1.8-billion guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   The only major airline to receive a guarantee so far is America
West, whose Phoenix-based parent, America West Holdings Corp., on
Friday said its second-quarter loss narrowed to $8.5 million, or 25
cents a share, from $42.5 million, or $1.26 a share, a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Pacific Crossing Files for Bankruptcy Protection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asia Global Crossing Ltd.'s majority-owned Pacific Crossing, an
undersea cable operator, filed for bankruptcy protection after sales
on its fiber-optic networks slowed.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Crossing, which operates cable between Japan and the U.S.,
listed assets and debt of more than $100 million each in its Chapter
11 petition filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   Asia Global Crossing is 59% owned by Global Crossing Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   A slowdown in sales and uncertainty about improvement led to the
filing, Asia Global Crossing spokeswoman Madelyn Smith said. Instead
of buying large contracts for capacity on the lines, companies are
opting for less expensive short-term leases, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Crossing, with headquarters in Los Angeles, also owes more
than $700 million in senior secured debt, which it used to expand its
network system.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is distressed given the telecommunications slump,"
Smith said. "The bankruptcy filing ensures that customer service is
not cut off."</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Asia Global Crossing owns 85% of Pacific Crossing.
Marubeni Corp.'s Vectant owns the rest, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing sought Chapter 11 protection in January after
amassing $12.4 billion in debt building a 100,000-mile fiber-optic
network in 27 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Crossing has hired investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein to help evaluate its options, the company said.</TE>

<HD>HPL Fires CEO, Issues Warning on Accounting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The wave of accounting scandals sweeping corporate America claimed a
Silicon Valley victim Friday when a small maker of specialty software
fired its chief executive and warned investors not to rely on its
past financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of HPL Technologies Inc. of San Jose plummeted as much as
71% to $4 on Nasdaq before the market halted trading and demanded
more information from the company.</LD>
<LD>   HPL said that it removed Chairman and CEO David Lepejian from his
posts and that the board's audit committee was investigating
"financial and accounting irregularities" with the aid of a law firm.</LD>
<TE>   "Based on its preliminary investigation, the company believes that
a material amount of revenue was improperly recognized during one or
more earlier periods," HPL said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The company had about 300 employees in March and isn't widely
known, but HPL had been reporting increasing profit and sales.</TE>
<TE>   News of the inquiry resonated with Silicon Valley investors and
executives, who have wondered privately when the prevalent stock
options and creative accounting of the high-tech boom originating
here would come back to haunt more local firms, as they have at
companies elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In May, federal prosecutors charged former CEOs of two publicly
traded technology firms, Unify Corp. and Quintus Corp., with criminal
securities fraud for allegedly inflating sales figures. Though no
charges have been filed against HPL, it is the first Silicon Valley
warning of a misstatement since WorldCom Inc. announced it had
misclassified a record $3.9 billion in expenses.</TE>
<TE>   A former top official of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
speaking on condition of anonymity, recently estimated that as many
as 20% of Silicon Valley companies used fraudulent accounting
methods, while 50% to 70% used "aggressive accounting
practices--whether legal or not is another question."</TE>
<TE>   One person who has been following HPL closely speculated that the
board examined the sales figures only because of the increased
pressure being brought on executives and directors to stand by their
books. CEOs soon will have to sign oaths that their numbers are
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing else has changed" at the company, the person said.</TE>
<TE>   HPL said the problem involved sales to an international
distributor, which people close to the company said was a Canon Inc.
unit in Japan responsible for three-fourths of HPL's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Elie Antoun, a company director and the CEO of MediaQ Inc., was
named acting CEO of HPL. The company said the crisis probably would
scuttle HPL's planned acquisition of closely held IDS Software
Systems Inc. for stock and $23 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   HPL makes software used by major semiconductor chip manufacturers
to improve their processes.</TE>
<TE>   "The distressing thing is that customers report they really like
the technology," said analyst Jennifer Jordan of Wells Fargo
Securities, who had been recommending the company's stock. Jordan
doesn't own the shares personally and Wells Fargo has no investment
banking business with HPL.</TE>
<TE>   Three other analysts who had been recommending the shares work for
firms that underwrote HPL's initial public offering, UBS Warburg,
SoundView Technology Group and Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill Inc. Those
analysts didn't return calls seeking comment. The company scheduled a
conference call for investors Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Lepejian, 41, couldn't be reached. He owned more than 10 million
HPL shares in February, though he sold 30,000 shares that month for
more than $450,000.</TE>
<TE>   The company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, said it couldn't
comment on client matters. PricewaterhouseCoopers also performed
other services for HPL, according to that firm's securities filings.</TE>
<TE>   In its fiscal year ended in March, HPL said it earned $6.7 million
on sales of $37 million, nearly triple the year-earlier figure. It
had said it would have at least $77 million in sales this fiscal
year.</TE>

<HD>J&amp;J Anemia Drug Linked to Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: A U.S. probe centers on a plant where
Eprex is made. The stock falls sharply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal criminal investigation of record keeping at a Johnson &amp;
Johnson manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico has been indirectly
linked to one of the pharmaceutical giant's most profitable but
controversial anemia drugs. The drug, Eprex, has been linked to 141
foreign cases of a rare but sometimes fatal blood disorder.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration had little to say about the case
involving its Office of Criminal Investigations and the Justice
Department. But Johnson &amp; Johnson said the investigation originated
with a civil lawsuit brought in 2000 by a former employee who had
been fired from J&amp;J's Ortho Biologics plant.</LD>
<LD>   The former employee has alleged that he was ordered to falsify
records at various times between 1996 and 1998 to hide manufacturing
lapses, according to J&amp;J.</LD>
<TE>   Eprex, which accounts for $1.3 billion in annual sales, is
manufactured at the J&amp;J Puerto Rico plant and sold in Europe and
Canada, where cases of the disorder, known as pure red blood cell
aplasia, have surfaced. Eprex is similar to Procrit, which is sold in
the U.S. under a manufacturing agreement with Thousand Oaks-based
Amgen Inc.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J denied there was any link between the probe and suspected drug
side effects.</TE>
<TE>   On June 27, J&amp;J said it was investigating possible triggers of the
rare blood disorder in which bone marrow fails to produce vital red
blood cells. Eprex is designed to stimulate production of those
cells. J&amp;J has said that it was not certain why some Eprex patients
developed red blood cell aplasia but that a number of factors may be
involved.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation comes despite the fact that the FDA had
performed an inspection of the plant in October 2001, which according
to an FDA official included a check of the facility's record keeping.
The plant "got a fairly clean bill of health" in that inspection,
said the official, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2002, the facility also ws inspected by the French
government equivalent of the FDA. An FDA source said that inspection
also failed to turn up major problems.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J spokesman Marc Monseau said in an interview Friday that the
company stood by the integrity of Eprex. Monseau referred to the
lawsuit as a case of a disgruntled former employee fired for cause
who also had no connection to the manufacturing of Eprex.</TE>
<TE>   News of the case rocked investors in the New Brunswick, N.J.-based
drug maker. J&amp;J shares fell $7.88, or 16%, to $41.85 on the New York
Stock Exchange, hitting a 12-month low.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J is the latest drug company to come under the FDA's microscope
for possible quality-control problems. The agency is investigating
Schering-Plough Corp., Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Abbott Laboratories for
alleged lapses related to record keeping and manufacturing. Earlier
this year, Schering-Plough paid the FDA an unprecedented $500-million
fine related to problems at plants in Puerto Rico and New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "The tripwire sensibility of investors was already on alert among
investors after the Enron and Global Crossing scandals and with Merck
and Bristol-Myers Squibb under scrutiny and now Johnson &amp; Johnson,"
said Standard &amp; Poor's analyst Arthur Wong. "There are just so many
uncertainties that, to investors, this is like the financial version
of 'The Perfect Storm.' "</TE>

<HD>Kinko's Sues Founder Over Access to Files</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kinko's Inc., the closely held operator of 1,100 photocopying and
printing stores across the U.S., has sued the chain's founder and
other minority shareholders over their demands to see company
documents.</LD>
<LD>   Kinko's claims that Paul Orfalea, who founded the company in 1970,
and other minority shareholders are engaged in a "fishing expedition"
with their request for corporate files in an attempt to second-guess
decisions made by the company's board and management, the complaint
said. The shareholders have requested documents from January 1997
through 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Orfalea resigned from his position as chairman in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The company's suit, filed Thursday, asks the Los Angeles Superior
Court to rule that the shareholders can access only "non-privileged"
accounting books and minutes from shareholder and board meetings that
occurred in California. Any further "unlawful and/or unfair
inspection demands" should be barred, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   Kinko's, which is majority owned by New York-based Clayton,
Dubilier &amp; Rice, moved to Dallas earlier this year from Ventura.
Orfalea founded the company at UC Santa Barbara to provide copy
services to college students. He couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.</TE>

<HD>President of Ford's Lincoln Unit Quits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. said Brian Kelley resigned after nine months as
president of the Lincoln Mercury division, the latest departure of an
executive hired by ousted Chief Executive Jacques Nasser.</LD>
<LD>   Kelley, 41, took over the Irvine-based luxury-car unit in October
after joining the world's second-largest auto maker in June 1999. He
held jobs developing Ford's Internet sales as part of Nasser's
strategy to focus Ford as a consumer company.</LD>
<LD>   Darryl Hazel, 54, takes over Lincoln Mercury on Aug. 1, said
spokesman Jim Trainor.</LD>
<TE>   Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. replaced Nasser as CEO in October
and changed the Nasser strategy to focus the company on making cars
and trucks and improving quality. The auto maker replaced Firestone
tires linked to an estimated 271 U.S. highway deaths in accidents
involving the tires, mostly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles,
and had a $5.45-billion loss in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Executives hired by Nasser "were all brought in to transform the
Ford culture into some global conglomerate that happened to build
cars," said Maryann Keller, an independent auto analyst and
consultant. "In the new Ford, these people carry the baggage of being
handpicked by Jacques Nasser to carry out a revolution."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley, who is leaving to become chief executive of relocation and
logistic services provider SIRVA, said he didn't feel pressured to
depart Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good chance to be a CEO of a good growth opportunity," he
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   His power diminished in April when Ford division President Jim
O'Connor was appointed group vice president in charge of North
American marketing, sales and service, which includes
responsibilities for Lincoln Mercury.</TE>
<TE>   The division also was separated from the group of Ford's European
brands called Premier Auto Group and returned under the Ford
umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its overall restructuring plan announced in January,
the auto maker has been trying to revitalize the flagging division.
Through June, Lincoln sales are down 16.6%, and Mercury sales are
down 18.3% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   The Lincoln Continental, Mercury Cougar and Mercury Villager were
dropped and new products added, such as the restyled Lincoln
Navigator and upcoming Lincoln Aviator sport utility vehicle.</TE>

<KH>MARKETS IN CRISIS</KH>
<HD>Aversion to Stocks Hits Nearly Every Sector</HD>
<DH>Trading: Blue chips fall much more sharply than tech shares
in the stampede away from equities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nowhere (almost) to hide.</LD>
<LD>   That has become the dominant theme on Wall Street as the selling
has mushroomed over the last eight weeks.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, stocks tumbled across the board on record trading
volume, but the biggest losers weren't technology shares--the sector
that has borne the brunt of the bear market's wrath since March 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Although the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index fell 37.80
points, or 2.8%, to 1,319.15 Friday, its losses were far exceeded by
the blue-chip Dow Jones industrials, which sank 390.23 points, or
4.6%, to 8,019.26, and the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which slid
33.81 points, or 3.8%, to 847.75.</TE>
<TE>   As the fear factor soared on Wall Street, many investors rushed
into Treasury securities and into gold.</TE>
<TE>   "The mood is just horrible," said Mike Driscoll, a trader at
brokerage Bear Stearns. "Anything people can point to as a negative
they are jumping all over it."</TE>
<TE>   Investors also bailed out in Europe, driving key share indexes
down 5% or more there.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, U.S. investors' dislike of stocks has broadened
to include nearly every major industry sector. This week, all but
three of 123 S&amp;P 500 industry groups declined.</TE>
<TE>   "Money managers are getting calls saying, 'Just liquidate my
holdings. Raise cash,' " said Will Muggia, manager of the Touchstone
Emerging Growth Fund. "Part of the fear is that there's no place to
hide."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the drug sector was rocked by news that federal
regulators are probing allegations of fraudulent record-keeping at
Johnson &amp; Johnson's Puerto Rico plant, which makes an anemia drug
that is one of the firm's bestsellers.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J, a Dow stock, dived $7.88 to $41.85.</TE>
<TE>   Other industry groups leading Friday's decline included
engineering companies, soft-drink makers and gas utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow has fallen every session but one in the last two weeks,
losing 14% in all, as more investors question the outlook for company
profits amid widening corporate financial scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Fourth of July, about $1.5 trillion in investor wealth
has evaporated from the stock market, based on the Wilshire 5,000
index.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some upbeat second-quarter corporate earnings reports this
week, many investors are focusing on iffy prospects for earnings
growth in the second half of the year. Ninety-three companies in the
S&amp;P 500 have said third-quarter earnings would be lower than
forecast, according to Thomson First Call. That's more than twice the
40 that have said they would surpass estimates.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the wave of alleged corporate improprieties shows no
sign of cresting.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, DaimlerChrysler tumbled $3.90 to $43.65 after saying
the Justice Department is conducting a criminal probe into
allegations of price-fixing by Mercedes-Benz dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Also, gas utility Nicor plunged $15.26, or 40%, to $22.75. The
firm said it found differences between estimates of natural gas sales
and actual revenue at a joint venture with Dynegy, an energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, losers swamped winners Friday by 25 to 8 on the New York
Stock Exchange, and total trading volume topped 3 billion shares, the
highest ever.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq losers topped winners by 25 to 10. Volume exceeded 2.4
billion shares.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow was down 7.7%, Nasdaq slumped 4%, and the
S&amp;P 500 slid 8%.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what I think the market goes down," said Alan Hoffman,
who manages $1 billion at Value Line Asset Management. "It's
god-awful psychological black death out there. I don't have any
projections or investment advice."</TE>
<TE>   PepsiCo fell $4.10 to $36.20. The second-largest soft-drink
producer said second-quarter profit and sales at its Frito-Lay unit
rose less than forecast. Declining Tropicana juice sales also hurt
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In the tech sector, Sun Microsystems sank $1.55 to $4.25. The
maker of computer servers said that fiscal 2003 earnings would be
less than analysts predicted and that it would have a slight loss
this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Markets also plunged in Europe on fears that Wall Street could
drag the U.S. economy down with it, halting the global recovery.
Also, the dollar's steep decline in recent weeks is raising pricing
problems for European exporters.</TE>
<TE>   The main German stock index fell 5.1% on Friday, while the British
index lost 4.6%.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take years for people to feel confident again," said Andy
Nigg, money manager at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. "Anyone
who isn't concerned is living in La-La Land."</TE>
<TE>   But the dollar stabilized Friday, which surprised some traders who
expected it to slide anew with U.S. stocks' decline.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors rushed into Treasury securities, seeking safe
haven. The yield on the 10-year T-note fell to 4.52% from 4.61% on
Thursday. Shorter-term yields also slid.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities markets, near-term gold futures jumped $6.90 to
$323.90 an ounce. But gold remains below its recent high of $327.80.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters and Bloomberg News were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Time Inc.'s Woman of the Fiscal Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ann Moore made her mark at the world's largest magazine company by
knowing the truth about consumer spending: Women do the shopping.</LD>
<LD>   With that insight, Moore transformed People from a black and white
grocery store magazine into a powerhouse brand with moneymaking
spinoffs InStyle and Teen People and made herself the maven of what
she calls women's newsmagazines.</LD>
<LD>   And now, with her elevation Thursday to chairwoman and chief
executive of Time Inc., AOL Time Warner Inc.'s powerful publishing
empire, Moore becomes the maven of the entire magazine industry.</LD>
<TE>   The highest-ranking woman in AOL Time Warner, Moore will command
the world's largest publishing company--140 magazines with 298
million readers worldwide--with market-leading titles such as Time,
Sports Illustrated and Entertainment Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Time Inc. has posted 10 consecutive years of earnings growth and
is critical to the corporation's success. In fiscal 2001, Time Inc.
contributed $4.8 billion of the $38 billion in total corporate
revenue, with the division accounting for nearly 10% of the corporate
profit, according to company figures.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, 52, is all too aware of the challenge of maintaining this
record amid the continuing slump in magazine advertising that saw
sales fall 15% last year, according to analysts, and sales are
expected to slide an additional 5% this year.</TE>
<TE>   But if Moore is worried, she isn't letting on.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have been fulfilled without it, but thrilled to have it,"
Moore said of her promotion. "My goal is to continue to grow Time
Inc. My only hard problem is finding and maintaining the best people
in the magazine business."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the key to continued success is to maintain the
status quo, she said, ticking off goals that include keeping costs
down without short-changing readers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're better than the competition, we do a better job ... we are
completely consumer-focused," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore replaces former Time Inc. Chairman Don Logan, who with HBO
Chairman Jeff Bewkes has been promoted to AOL Time Warner group
chairman as part of a management shake-up at the troubled media
conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   She takes issue with those who describe her management style as
"brash." In fact, Moore said, she works hard at being collegial and
prefers to find solutions by hashing out difficulties at staff
meetings instead of behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lot of things, but I'm not brash," she said. She allowed
only that she is more outgoing than her predecessor, Logan. "He plays
it more close to the vest. I like brainstorming with my direct
reports."</TE>
<TE>   Moore started in the finance department at Time Inc. in 1978,
straight out of Harvard Business School. She quickly moved to Sports
Illustrated, where she worked for 10 years before moving to People in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody else wanted the People job," said Moore, adding that
critics thought the magazine had no growth potential. The
breakthrough concept that turned that around, Moore said, was
positioning People as a women's newsmagazine.</TE>
<TE>   "That led us to all sorts of crazy decisions," she said, noting
that she quickly went to color pictures and shifted from a Monday
delivery to Friday, when more women would see the fresh issue in the
grocery store checkout line as they do the weekly shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Moore said there would be some concessions to the sluggish
economy.</TE>
<TE>   After launching seven titles in recent years, including Real
Simple, Moore said the company recognized that the economy cannot
support more magazine titles.</TE>
<TE>   Moore plans to hold down costs as best she can at Time Inc. and
wait for the tide to turn.</TE>
<TE>   "In the teeth of this recession, we'll delay investment spending
on new products," she said. Then, "we'll be well-positioned when [the
economy] comes back."</TE>

<HD>Pitt: Cheney's Status Won't Affect Probe</HD>
<DH>Accounting: SEC chief did not take Bush's comment as a hint
to clear the vice president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt said
Friday that his agency's probe of accounting at Halliburton Co. under
Dick Cheney won't be influenced by President Bush's statement that
the vice president will be cleared.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt, speaking at the National Press Club, was asked whether Bush
was sending investigators a "hint" this week with the expression of
confidence in Cheney's innocence as head of the No. 2
oilfield-services company. The SEC is investigating the Dallas-based
company's accounting of cost overruns on construction jobs.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, if there was a hint, it went over my head," said Pitt, a
Republican who was appointed by Bush last year. "No one in this
country gets a pass. I don't care what their status is. I don't care
what their prestige is."</LD>
<TE>   Pitt focused on SEC efforts to restore investor confidence in the
U.S. markets after accounting scandals surfaced at Enron Corp.,
Arthur Andersen and WorldCom Inc. Pitt said U.S. markets won't rise
until culpable chief executives, chief financial officers and
accountants are found guilty of fraud and are imprisoned.</TE>
<TE>   "We need real CEOs and real CFOs, real accountants going to jail
when they have been guilty of perpetrating a fraud," Pitt said. The
SEC can bring only civil charges against companies and executives for
violations of securities law. It can refer cases to federal
prosecutors, who can bring criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt blamed corporations for lying and accounting firms for
helping them to cover up. The SEC has filed 122 actions for financial
reporting and issuer disclosure violations in the first 10 months of
this fiscal year, "20% higher than we filed in all of 2000," Pitt
said.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a question on whether he will resign, Pitt said he
wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Losers walk away from their responsibilities," he said. "Winners
try to make sure that they fulfill their promises and their oath of
office."</TE>

<KH>MARKETS IN CRISIS</KH>
<HD>Investors Agonize Over Riding Out the Slide</HD>
<DH>Personal finance: Advisors say most of their clients aren't
abandoning stocks despite the pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What to do now?</LD>
<LD>   As stocks continue to plummet, many individual investors say
they're paralyzed--unwilling to stomach stepping out of the stock
market for fear it will turn soon, but also unwilling to put new
money to work.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't buy because I feel that there is nothing I can trust at
the moment," said Charlene Hyde, a Pacific Palisades speech
pathologist. "But I can't sell because I've been told over and over
that when things go down is when it's time to buy. I just pray for
better times and hope I can maintain my sanity."</LD>
<TE>   It may be that paralysis--even if panic-induced--is the best thing
for many investors now, financial advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   "For the moment, being paralyzed is probably a good thing," said
Tim Kochis, planner with Kochis Fitz in San Francisco. "At this
point, it's way too late to get out as a defensive move. And it's
wise to be exposed to future opportunities by having some money in
the market."</TE>
<TE>   William Howell, portfolio manager at Bedel Financial Consulting in
Indianapolis, agreed. "This would be the absolute wrong time to be
making any major moves out of the market."</TE>
<TE>   True, financial advisors have used the same line throughout the
long bear market, now 28 months old. But they believe their job is to
keep their clients focused on the long term.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, this bear market will end. And even if it isn't
immediately followed by a rousing bull market, investors who have a
time horizon that stretches beyond 10 years can expect to make money
in stocks again, if history is a guide, advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who have built a diversified portfolio should be
comfortable sticking with their program, said Brian Pon, financial
advisor at Financial Connections in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The investors who face a crisis now are those who only recently
have come to realize that their investments don't match their risk
tolerance, planners say.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their general advice against selling, financial advisors
say investors shouldn't have money in stocks if those funds will be
needed in the next few years. The market may well be nearing a
bottom, but if it isn't, those with short time horizons may find
themselves financially crippled if they stay put.</TE>
<TE>   "One lesson investors should take away from this is that there's
never a bad time to start having a diversified portfolio," Pon said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that two clients capitulated to fear last week--cashing
out of stocks completely once they received their June investment
statements--struck San Diego financial planner Ginita Wall as a sign
that the market is nearing bottom, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Long-held market wisdom is that bear markets end only after the
weakest links--small investors without the fortitude to ride through
market storms--are shaken out. That may be happening in earnest now.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now starting to see people say that they can't take it
anymore, that they need to get out, even though they know it's the
wrong thing to do," said Edward O'Hara, owner of Capital Asset
Management Services in Silver Spring, Md. "We have to be in some
waters right now where there are some tremendous buying
opportunities, but we are just afraid to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, advisors say the bulk of their investors aren't abandoning
the market.</TE>
<TE>   But for many people, the pain is becoming intense.</TE>
<TE>   Liesel Friedrich, a Santa Monica homemaker who has confidently
held on to her stocks through the long rout since 2000, said she
finally has lost her calm.</TE>
<TE>   "I am like a deer with headlights blaring in my face," she said.
"There are so many negative things. But I have grown up with the idea
of never selling. I don't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, I hope that the market has hit bottom, and it seems to
keep going down," said Marilyn Barrett, a Los Angeles tax attorney.
"We are all just paralyzed, not knowing what to do and just hoping
that things will get better on Monday."</TE>
<TE>   Some advisors say they're trying to get investors with cash on
hand to think about putting more money to work in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm telling clients with cash to really start thinking about
putting some money in the market," said Marc Pressman with Pressman
Financial Consulting in Oak Park, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   But advisors also say they will be forced to give unpopular advice
to many people in the next few years: Those who have lost so much in
stocks that they feel they can't meet their goals can't expect to
invest their way back to economic health.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to hear it, but what people need to do is spend less
and save more," said Wall, a director of the Women's Institute for
Financial Education. "But it's like saying, 'Eat less,' when people
want to lose weight. They want a pill. They want the answer that the
stock market provided before, which was invest a dollar and you'll be
a millionaire by the end of the week."</TE>
<TE>   Those days are gone--if not forever, certainly for the near
future, planners contend.</TE>
<TE>   Investors should be lowering their expectations for market returns
over the next decade, even if stocks are nearing the end of their
decline, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, at this point many individual investors may be happy
with any return--as long as it isn't negative.</TE>

<LD>Shares of Nicor Inc. plummeted after the Illinois utility owner
disclosed losses and accounting irregularities at an energy-marketing
venture with Dynegy Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Nicor, the holding company for Northern Illinois Gas, fell $15.26,
or 40%, to $22.75 in trading on the NYSE. Shares of Houston-based
Dynegy tumbled nearly 12% to $3.97, also on the NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   Irregularities at Nicor Energy stemmed mostly from differences
between estimates of natural gas sales and actual revenue, a

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Department of Housing and Urban Development will unveil a system
next week to monitor home appraisers in an effort to reduce a rising
level of delinquencies of government-backed loans to low-income
households.</LD>
<LD>   The system will seek to remove individuals whose appraisals lead
to excessive rates of delinquencies and foreclosures on Federal
Housing Administration, or FHA, loans.</LD>
<LD>   HUD and the FHA, which insures lenders against loss on mortgages,
have come under fire from critics who claim their lack of oversight
of appraisers has led to abuses in lending to low-income households.
FHA loan delinquencies exceeded 11% in the first quarter, compared
with 3% for conventional mortgage loans.</LD>

<LD>Merck Profit Falls Amid Competition</LD>
<LD>   Merck &amp; Co.'s second-quarter profit fell 3.6% as the
second-largest U.S. drug maker's costs rose faster than sales, which
were hurt by competition from generic versions of its hypertension
and heartburn drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $1.75 billion, or 77 cents a share. Revenue
rose 7.7% to $12.8 billion, helped by better-than-expected sales of
its painkiller Vioxx, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Merck's materials and production costs rose 15%, while generic
competition eroded sales of older products such as the heartburn drug
Pepcid and hypertension treatment Vasotec. Higher sales of Vioxx and
Merck's top-selling cholesterol drug, Zocor, helped limit the profit
decline.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck fell 50 cents to
$41.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>* Avon Products Inc. said second-quarter profit rose 12% to $154.9
million, or 64 cents a share, because of higher sales in Europe and
the U.S. and gains from currency trades. Sales rose 3.9% to $1.51
billion.</LD>
<LD>   * USFreightways Corp.'s second-quarter net income fell 48% to
$5.94 million, or 22 cents a share, as the regional trucker reduced
the value of assets at the freight management unit it is considering
selling. Operating earnings matched analysts' average estimate of 38
cents.</LD>
<LD>   * Level 3 Communications Inc.'s chief executive denied he sought
shares in initial public offerings as a "sweetheart deal" for giving
more business to Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit. James
Crowe's statement came in response to claims in a lawsuit filed by
former Salomon broker David Chacon, who said the brokerage rewarded
top executives of telecommunications clients with thousands of shares
from stock offerings underwritten by the firm.</LD>
<TE>   * Tyco International Ltd., whose stock has plunged 79% this year

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Express Co. was accused in a lawsuit of deceiving
shareholders about junk bond investments that lowered the company's
pretax profit by more than $1 billion in the first half of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The class-action suit was filed on behalf of investors who
acquired the stock between July 18, 1999, and July 17, 2001,
according to a statement from the plaintiffs' law firm, Lovell &amp;
Stewart in New York.</LD>
<LD>   An American Express spokesman said the firm had not seen the suit
and could not comment.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of American Express, which rose to $63 in October 2000,
fell as low as $37.17 on July 18, 2001, the day the firm announced it
lost $826 million, before taxes, as junk bond default rates soared.
Earlier in the year, the travel and credit card company said it had
written off $182 million on the investments.</TE>

<LD>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. reported a slight rise in
second-quarter profit but said third-quarter results would miss Wall
Street expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company said operating profit edged
up 2% to $211 million, or $2.29 a share, beating analysts' average
estimate of $2.27, with help from its acquisition of Santa Fe Natural
Tobacco Co.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue was flat at $1.7 billion as steep increases in cigarette
prices offset lower volume and higher promotional costs.</LD>
<TE>   RJR said it expects third-quarter earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 a
share, compared with analysts' forecast of $2.32, because it
anticipates continued declines in U.S. shipments.</TE>

<HD>EU Delays Trade War Over U.S. Steel Duties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Union on Friday put off a trade war with the United
States by a month, delaying a decision to impose sanctions worth more
than $300 million in a row over heavy U.S. steel duties.</LD>
<LD>   The EU's 15 ambassadors unanimously agreed to the delay after
Washington offered 11th-hour concessions. The bloc's foreign
ministers now are expected to endorse the recommendation at a meeting
in Brussels on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But the European Commission, which had proposed holding off on the
sanctions, said Washington needed to do more.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a strong positive signal from the Americans, and we
have responded to that," Peter Carl, trade director in the EU's
executive arm, said. "We have decided not to pull the trigger."</TE>
<TE>   He was speaking after the commission told EU ambassadors it did
not now recommend applying sanctions in August as a result of
President Bush's decision in March to slap heavy duties on steel
imports. Bush, whose tariff move provoked fury among his country's
trading partners, has said he will make final decisions by Aug. 31 on
how much steel to exempt from duties.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the U.S. trade representative's office said the new
exemptions--offered hours before the European Commission made its
recommendation--covered an additional 14 foreign steel products, for
a total of 261 since the start of June.</TE>

<TE>   Gateway $3.6 Million</TE>
<TE>   Computer giant Gateway Inc. has been hit with a $3.6-million jury
verdict for a wrong number that flooded another company's toll-free
telephone line with calls from thousands of angry Gateway customers.</TE>
<TE>   The number belongs to Mo' Money, a Pensacola, Fla., business that
manufactures and distributes promotional items with company logos,
including T-shirts, caps, gym bags and jackets. A federal jury
awarded the damages to Mo' Money on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a nightmare," Mo' Money President Cliff Mowe said. "We had
as many as 8,000 extra calls a month, and these were all angry
people."</TE>
<TE>   In January 1999, someone at Gateway erred by using the 800 prefix
instead of 888 for the computer company's toll-free customer
complaint line.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Gateway sent Mo' Money's number to more than 275
Gateway retail stores. The phone number also was posted on Gateway's
Web site and listed on Internet billings.</TE>

30, compared with a loss of $1.9 billion in the same period a year
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Net sales were $4.2 billion, down 51% from $8.5 billion in the
same period last year.</LD>
<TE>   Ericsson also said it will issue about 8 billion new shares at a
lower-than-expected price of 41 cents to raise $3.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company said cost-cutting measures were having an effect, but
it warned that demand this year for mobile systems equipment will be
worse than it had anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "The total message here is that we cannot control the market
environment and we don't see really the turnaround," Chief Executive
Kurt Hellstroem said. "But we are in control of our costs and our
plans for the future."</TE>
<TE>   He said he expects Ericsson's work force to be less than 60,000 by
the end of 2003. The company had about 76,000 employees at the end of
June, down from 107,000 at the beginning of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * Mentor Graphics Corp., a maker of software that engineers use to
design computer chips, reported a loss before charges of $28.1
million, or 6 cents a share, on a 9% decline in revenue to $135.4
million. Analysts on average were expecting a 4-cent loss. Including
one-time items, the loss was $36.6 million, or 56 cents a share,
compared with $13.5 million, or 20 cents, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Infineon Technologies announced a sharply reduced loss for its
third quarter due to a recovery in chip prices and cost cutting, and
forecast rising demand from computer and handset makers. Europe's No.
2 chip maker reported a net loss of $76.9 million, compared with a
loss of $374 million a year ago. Sales at the Munich, Germany-based
company rose 10% to $1.42 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * A big jump in revenue helped Chartered Semiconductor
Manufacturing Ltd. trim its losses in the second quarter, the world's
third- largest chip maker said.</TE>
<TE>   The Singapore-based company also predicted modest
quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in the current quarter. Chartered
posted its sixth consecutive net loss of $90.7 million for the second
quarter, compared with a loss of $107.6 million a year ago. Revenue
was $127.5 million, up 27% from a year ago and a 51% jump from the
first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Samsung Electronics Co.'s second-quarter profit more than
doubled as sales of key products such as computer memory chips,
mobile phone handsets and flat-panel displays increased as the
economy recovered. The world's biggest maker of computer memory chips
said it earned $1.67 billion, up from $744 million a year ago. Sales
grew 24% to $8.49 billion.</TE>

<HD>Weaker Greenback No Boon for Exporters</HD>
<DH>Commerce: The overall state of the economy outweighs the
dollar's effects here and abroad. The U.S. reports a record trade
deficit in May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI and MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slumping dollar has made American goods more affordable overseas,
but Friday's report that the trade deficit had widened to a record
$37.6 billion in May shows that a weaker currency isn't going to
spark an export boom any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   That's because currency fluctuations are just one piece in a
complex mix governing trade flows, with the most important factor the
overall strength of the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   Even weighed down by corporate scandals and a swooning stock
market, the U.S. remains the driving force of a global economy
heavily dependent on consumption by American businesses and
consumers. Downward spikes in the U.S. markets ripple around the
world, sapping strength from trading partners, most of which were
just starting to show signs of a recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has lost about 11% of
its value against the yen and 15% against the euro. On Friday, the
dollar held its ground against the euro, at $1.01, but fell against
the Japanese currency, buying 115.77 yen, down 0.91 from a day
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Although prices of U.S. airplanes, machine tools and vegetables
have declined overseas and imports have become more costly, Americans
continue to consume foreign goods at a voracious rate.</TE>
<TE>   Even as exports rose 0.7% to $80.6 billion in May, imports climbed
1.8% to $118.3 billion, the Commerce Department said in its monthly
report. The resulting trade gap was 4% higher than the $36.1 billion
registered in April.</TE>
<TE>   "Exporters face a lot of lackluster markets," said Gary Hufbauer,
a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a
Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   It also takes months for a weaker currency to be reflected on the
export side because the goods must work their way through the trading
system. In the meantime, the value of imported products entering U.S.
ports gets an immediate boost when converted into dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high for California, the nation's largest
international trader, which last year saw its exports dive 11% to
$106.8 billion. Although a weak dollar alone won't revive the state's
exporting fortunes, companies such as Salinas, Calif.-based
International Produce Group, one of the nation's leading exporters of
fruits and vegetables, say it already is giving them a lift.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely making the product more affordable," said sales
executive Dottie Massey.</TE>
<TE>   But for sectors such as computers and electronics, which accounted
for nearly half of California's exports last year, the benefits of a
weaker dollar are less clear- cut. For example, computer chips
designed by a U.S. firm are typically manufactured and tested in
facilities around the world, rendering a currency swing in one
country something of a wash, said George M. Scalise, president of the
Semiconductor Industry Assn. in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   American companies that do business abroad get a boost from a
weaker currency because their overseas earnings are worth more when
converted back into dollars. But a weaker dollar raises the price of
imports, unless they are priced in dollars. Because U.S.
manufacturers consume about 20% of all imports, they face higher
costs on that side of the ledger.</TE>
<TE>   The flip side is true for European companies such as Swiss-based
Nestle, which conducts more than 40% of its business in U.S. dollars
or currencies tied to the dollar. Those earnings will be worth less
when they are converted to a stronger Swiss franc.</TE>
<TE>   But on the plus side, the company's dollar-priced imports of
commodities such as coffee, sugar and cocoa are cheaper, as is its
dollar-denominated debt. It is too soon to tell whether the latest
currency shift will be a plus or minus, said Nestle spokesman Hans
Renk.</TE>
<TE>   The sliding dollar is clearly a plus for Pasadena-based label
maker Avery Dennison, which depends on overseas markets for 44% of
its sales, said Chief Financial Officer Daniel O'Bryant. Not only has
the weaker currency boosted the dollar value of its overseas
earnings, it has discouraged foreign competitors that have flooded
the U.S. market in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "A strong dollar is like bait to foreign competitors," O'Bryant
said. "Weak currency costs and strong currency revenues attracts them
to the U.S. market." To protect itself against financial turmoil,
Avery Dennison has created a "natural hedge" by building
manufacturing facilities near its customers so its costs and revenue
are in the same currencies.</TE>
<TE>   This globalization of the supply chain has diminished the effects
of currency changes for many firms. Nearly half of U.S. imports and
one-third of exports are intra-company, meaning they are transactions
between a U.S. parent and a foreign subsidiary or a foreign parent
and a U.S. offshoot.</TE>
<TE>   A large share of U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada consists of
components for autos and electronic goods that are assembled and
shipped back to the States. A U.S. auto maker is unlikely to increase
the shipment of parts to a Mexican assembler simply because a weak
dollar brings the price down. And that same auto maker would have to
pay more for imported crankshafts or leather seats.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've seen in the aftermath of the free-trade agreement is a
lot of intra-company trade and within-industry trade," said John
Johnston, chief economist for RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. "They
build parts of cars and ship them back and forth across the border in
different forms. This is less sensitive to the exchange rate."</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's strength was one of the factors that drove many U.S.
manufacturers to Canada and other offshore locations. But those firms
also were seeking benefits beyond a more favorable currency
situation, such as lower labor costs, more hospitable tax regimes or
the inside track to promising markets.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have to see a pronounced movement in the Canadian
dollar before you see those kinds of investments unwind," Johnston
said.</TE>
<TE>   American manufacturers have been particularly critical of a lofty
dollar. The National Assn. of Manufacturers estimates that a strong
dollar has cost U.S. manufacturers $140 billion in decreased export
sales and more than half a million lost manufacturing jobs in the
last year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Prices of U.S.-made machine tools sold in Europe by Oxnard-based
Haas Automation Inc. have not been adjusted downward to reflect the
dollar's recent slide, said President Gene Haas.</TE>
<TE>   That's because when the dollar was flying high, the company
refrained from increasing its prices in euros to reflect the exchange
rate differential, opting to absorb the hit out of its profit. Now
that the tables are turned, Haas said, the company is looking to get
some of that back.</TE>
<TE>   "We have eaten currency losses for years. Now we're just breaking
even," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers
Alliance, an Arlington, Va.-based trade group, is counting on the
weaker dollar to keep manufacturers close to home, where they are
less likely to run afoul of political unrest or transportation
glitches. That risk became all too real after the Sept. 11 attacks
shut U.S. airports and shipping lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Meckstroth is betting that the stock market turbulence and
corporate credibility problems will keep the dollar from rebounding,
as skittish investors continue to pull money out of the U.S. He hopes
that foreigners will use those repatriated funds to strengthen their
economies, weaning them from their reliance on export-led growth and
making them better customers for U.S. goods.</TE>
<TE>   But Japan, already a leading buyer of U.S. agriculture products
and high-tech goods, is resisting. Since May, the government has been
dumping yen to try to slow the currency's rise, fearful that it will
hurt exports and quash the country's hopes for a recovery from its
long slump. South Korea's government also has said it would intervene
if its currency, the won, continues to strengthen.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of countries around the world that have a stake
in a strong, growing U.S. economy so they can export to us,"
Meckstroth said. "But there's going to be an adjustment."</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Is on the Brink of Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>Telecom: A bankruptcy filing could be made as early as
Sunday, which would make the phone company the largest corporate
failure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executives at WorldCom Inc. worked late into the night Friday to put
together some final pieces for a bankruptcy case that could be filed
as early as Sunday, making the scandal-scarred phone company the
biggest corporate failure.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, they rushed to reassure critical business
customers and to attract new ones with stronger guarantees that
WorldCom's telecommunications services won't be interrupted as the
nation's second-largest long-distance carrier reorganizes under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton, Miss., company has raced through close to $4 billion
in cash and loans in the last four months, sources said, mainly
because vendors have been demanding full payment upfront in
anticipation of a possible bankruptcy filing. WorldCom will file its
petition "within five days" and possibly Sunday, a source familiar
with the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Service for about 20 million commercial and residential customers
of WorldCom and its MCI unit is not expected to be interrupted.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people who read the business pages are not going to be
shocked by a bankruptcy announcement, but certainly the size of this
bankruptcy would be overwhelming and unprecedented," said analyst
Patrick Comack of Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami. "This will be the big one,
the mother of all bankruptcies."</TE>
<TE>   The once-fast-growing voice and data carrier had nearly $104
billion in assets at the end of March, dwarfing Houston energy trader
Enron Corp.'s roughly $50 billion for the dubious distinction of
being the biggest business bust ever.</TE>
<TE>   Predictions of WorldCom's fall have been gaining since the company
announced June 25 that it had uncovered accounting irregularities. A
simple conversion of expenses into capital expenditures overstated
revenue by nearly $3.9 billion last year and the first three months
of this year, giving the company profits when it should have recorded
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and other industry experts already have sized up
WorldCom's business and where it might go in a bankruptcy sale of
assets. One of the most valuable pieces is the UUNet business that
moves a little more than half of the nation's Internet traffic. AT&amp;T
Corp., which handles most of the rest, and Sprint Corp. should be
interested in picking up those operations, said David Willis, an
analyst at META Group Inc. in Stamford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire business world is moving to [Internet] technology.
UUNet really leads in that area, and it's impossible to duplicate
that network," Willis said. Corporations are devoting, on average,
20% of their information technology budgets to telecommunications, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   With an eye on WorldCom's vital defense and government contracts,
the Federal Communications Commission has said that if the company
were forced to pull the plug on its operations, the FCC could delay
shuttering crucial businesses such as UUNet until customers find new
providers.</TE>
<TE>   Another key asset, especially for WorldCom's survival, is the
company's ability to hold on to lucrative business customers, who buy
a range of services and account for two-thirds of WorldCom's revenue.
Few have bolted so far, but many reportedly have signed up with other
carriers for back-up service.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority are signed to contracts lasting a year or more,
and the larger the contract, the longer it typically runs. The
contracts include "service level agreements" that require WorldCom to
cut its customers' bills if it fails to perform as well as promised.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, WorldCom doubled the credits provided by the
service level agreements. The point, spokeswoman Debbie Lewis said,
is "to add more financial teeth" to those agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The company also began offering a six-month unconditional service
guarantee to any business that signs up or renews its service by Aug.
31. Customers not satisfied after six months can break their
contracts without penalty, Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   And to calm anxieties further, WorldCom has been smothering its
bigger customers with attention, holding weekly conference calls with
senior vice presidents and sending many updates by e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been assuring us almost on a daily basis that service
levels will not change," said Robb Deignan, spokesman for the
California Department of General Services, which uses WorldCom for
much of its Calnet telecommunications network.</TE>
<TE>   The company isn't going to the same lengths to reassure its MCI
consumer and small-business customers. Instead, it's counting on
MCI's loyalty programs, including frequent-flier deals, to help keep
those customers on the line.</TE>
<TE>   MCI has been the most aggressive of the phone companies when it
comes to financial incentives. Heavy callers rack up 500 or more
frequent-flier miles per month.</TE>
<TE>   The company's latest residential service, launched in April,
includes unlimited local and long-distance calling for $50 to $60 per
month, along with frequent-flier miles or movie-rental credits. That
service has attracted more than 600,000 customers in 34 states,
including California, said spokeswoman Audrey Waters.</TE>
<TE>   Because consumers and small businesses regularly change
long-distance companies, WorldCom has to sign up new customers at a
brisk pace just to maintain its revenue stream. Waters and Lewis said
the firm is continuing to vie for new customers in all its product
lines.</TE>
<TE>   The company has announced only one service that it is
discontinuing: mobile phones. And aside from the disclosures it has
made on its Web site and in news releases, WorldCom is not giving the
residential or small-business customers it recruits any warnings
about its financial condition, Waters said.</TE>
<TE>   The well-known MCI brand is a valuable commodity, analysts say. To
create the kind of nationwide recognition it has is both costly and
time-consuming, they said, and something that the regional Bell
operating systems such as BellSouth Corp. and SBC Pacific Bell parent
SBC Communications Inc. would rather buy than build.</TE>

<HD>No Special Contingency Plan in Wings for Monday</HD>
<DH>Stocks: The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq officials
say they already have 'circuit breakers' in place to handle a huge
decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market said Friday that
they were making no special contingency plans for Monday, despite
concerns that the market could suffer another deep dive.</LD>
<LD>   The NYSE and Nasdaq systems can handle far more trading volume
than has occurred recently, spokesmen for the markets said.</LD>
<LD>   After market dives in 1987 and 1989, the exchanges implemented
"circuit breakers" to temporarily halt trading if stocks plunge. The
first trading halt would kick in if the Dow Jones industrials fell
950 points. If the drop occurred before 2 p.m. EDT, trading would be
suspended for an hour. The markets would halt for 30 minutes if the
950-point threshold was reached between 2 and 2:30 p.m., but there
would be no halt if it occurred after 2:30 p.m. Regular closing time
is 4 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   A Federal Reserve spokesman declined to comment on whether the
central bank was taking any precautionary steps. A spokeswoman for
the Securities and Exchange Commission said the agency closely
monitors the readiness of the markets to handle volume spikes, but
refused to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett Says Market May Remain Out of Sync</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said Friday that he believed
the stock market could remain "out of sync" with the U.S. economy for
a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "It would not surprise me if there was a long period of stagnation
... in the market, even though business may be making some progress,"
he said on NBC's evening news show.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had this history where the market gets out of sync with the
business world for long periods of time; usually it's because it
overshoots in one direction and then over-corrects in the other,"
Buffett said.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market bubble in the late-1990s was, in many respects,
the greatest in U.S. history, driving stock price-to-earnings ratios
to levels never seen before. Now, the question is whether investors
will drive stock valuations far below what might otherwise be
considered fair, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett advised small investors to sit out the market for a while
or invest in a low-cost stock index fund for the long term.</TE>

<TE>   Bear on Magazine Cover</TE>
<TE>   Seen as 'Buy' Indicator</TE>
<TE>   There's a Big Bad Bear on the cover of the latest BusinessWeek
magazine. Some on Wall Street say that's a sure sign that it's time
to buy stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The "magazine cover indicator" is a favorite of contrarian
investors. They say that when popular magazines have a bear as a
cover boy, the gloom has reached its peak, and there are few
investors left to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The cover of BusinessWeek's July 29 issue features a ferocious
grizzly.</TE>
<TE>   "From a contrarian perspective, this is a positive sign," Banc of
America Securities' strategist Tom McManus told clients in a note.</TE>

<LD>It's heartwarming to hear that this year's Dodger squad loves and
respects one another so much, but it's also mighty hard to picture
them making the postseason without some serious upgrades to the bench
and the bullpen. Jeff Reboulet, Chad Kreuter, Dave Hansen and Hiram
Bocachica are not exactly names that strike fear in opposing
pitchers, and opposing batters practically high-five one another with
glee whenever Jim Tracy calls Terry Mulholland, Paul Quantrill or
Guillermo Mota to the mound.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, it's too early to count them out entirely, but if the
Dodgers can win it all without Dan Evans making another major trade,
I'll eat my cleats.</LD>

<TE>   One big difference between the quality baseball organizations and
the also-rans is that the good teams never think they have enough
talent, while the also-rans always think they have a surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the Yankees add Jeff Weaver and the A's add Ted Lilly to
their starting staffs, which many thought didn't need any help. The
Angels, on the other hand, are three arms short in the bullpen and
respond by declaring the solution right under their noses--Scott
Schoeneweis.</TE>
<TE>   Giving the ball to Schoeneweis in a crunch hardly qualifies as the
type of decisive move that can turn a pennant race in your favor. The
guy's credentials are anything but breathtaking: recently dropped
from the rotation for cause; ERA around 5.50, right where it has been
every year; and, most recently, the surrender of five runs--and a
ballgame--in a two-inning stint at Minnesota on a night when he says,
"I threw the ball as well as I can throw."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, just maybe, the Angels need pitching help as much as the
good teams.</TE>

<TE>   Our local baseball team at Chavez Ravine is following a popular

justification, and now plummeting toward a full collapse.</TE>

<LD>So Allen Iverson, waiting to be charged on four felony counts, is
allowed to party in his mansion until his lawyer returns from
vacation. He is then arraigned and released on $10,000 bail (roughly
the equivalent of being released on bail of $27.95 to you and me)
while he awaits the inevitable legal slap on the wrist that is sure
to come his way. I'm telling you, these celebrity/athletes get away
with murder in this country, don't they?</LD>

<LD>I wish someone would do a survey of major league fans and see how we
feel. I have had season tickets to Dodger games for 25 years. I go
for hot dogs, peanuts, Vin Scully on the radio and Nancy Bea Hefley

who's out there.</LD>
<LD>   The reason I would like a survey is that the way I feel is the way
everyone I know feels. And that is, fire them! All of them. Jerks
like Barry Bonds along with class acts like Shawn Green. All of them.
Bring up triple-A players, not as "replacement players" but as
permanent major leaguers.</LD>
<LD>   Cut parking to $2. Cut food and ticket prices in half. Pay the
players $100,000 a year. How many of you reading this would love to
make a hundred grand playing a game six months out of 12?</LD>
<TE>   Bring back competitive balance to our great game. Do the survey.
I'm not alone.</TE>

<TE>   I don't understand it. Seven million people in the country are
unemployed and Bud Selig still has a job. This guy is overbearing and
arrogant, is a big dud in front of a microphone, and seems to be
pushing the players to strike.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball has to be the worst-run business in America. Thirty
owners each have their own agenda, and all Selig can do is declare a
tie in the All-Star game.</TE>

<TE>   When people ask why team owners voted to oust Fay Vincent--as
honorable and wise a man to ever serve as baseball commissioner--and
hired the hapless, unprincipled Bud Selig to replace him, all they
have to do is look at today's ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the traditional family-run teams, dedicated to long-term
stability and community service. Replacing them is a new breed of
"sultans of commerce," who purchase teams as ego trips or investments
and then, after accruing a little equity, strip them, move them or
dump them on the market (anyone recall the Florida Marlins?).</TE>
<TE>   Today's owners don't want a commissioner like Vincent, whose
foremost concern was maintaining the integrity of baseball; they want
a sycophant like Selig, a fellow capitalist (auto dealerships) and
fellow owner (Milwaukee Brewers) who can be relied upon not to rock
the boat. Such a pity.</TE>

<TE>   If Bud Selig and Don Fehr lead baseball into another
strike/lockout/work stoppage, David Stern should consider moving the
NBA to an April-October season.</TE>
<TE>   Just think, David, no battling the NFL, NHL or college basketball
for fans, advertising dollars or broadcast time; kids will be out of
school during the summer months, thus making them and their families
even more potential customers; and the air-conditioned arenas will be
places people will want to go to during the hot summer.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA players should like it, since they'd now get New Year's,
Thanksgiving and Christmas off with their families. Let Major League
Baseball go by the wayside.</TE>
<TE>   There's a new national pastime and it's called the NBA.</TE>

<TE>   In the negotiations for a better, wealthier life for the baseball

protection, groundskeepers, etc.?</TE>
<TE>   What about each player and each owner ponying up a small piece of
their last week's salary so these people can exist while the chosen
ones enjoy their unearned vacations at their estates and summer
places? Maybe it would be a small incentive to rethink our pleasures
for those of us who are simply disgusted with the unfairness of the

<LD>While I've been locked into the NL West race and my beloved Dodgers,
I was distracted when I read that fellow King fans are complaining
about not getting the big-name free agents. Go figure. I have a
couple of questions for the skeptical King fan:</LD>
<LD>   * Who did the Kings lose?</LD>
<LD>   Philippe Boucher is a loss, but would you pay him more than
Norstrom or Miller? Probably not. Cliff Ronning did nothing while in
L.A. and Kelly Buchberger is a grinder who can be replaced easily.</LD>
<TE>   * When was the last time the Kings had success in the free-agent
market? Can you say Steve Duchesne? So if spending $45 million on a
second-line center is not on Dave Taylor's to-do list,
understandable. Last time I saw, Taylor has had his success through
trading players, or do the names Ziggy Palffy, Jason Allison or Adam
Deadmarsh not ring a bell?</TE>
<TE>   * Do you know anything about the Kings' farm system? The Kings
have two talented prospects in Alex Frolov and Jared Aulin who are
ready to join the roster.</TE>
<TE>   * Why inflate the salaries? With the labor contract to run out
after this season and the impending salary cap and luxury taxes,
teams like Detroit, Colorado and Dallas will be in a financial mess.</TE>
<TE>   Be patient, this team is built for the long haul. Then again, it's
35 years and counting.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Check's in the Mail" [July 17], why is Lance Pugmire
giving press to a man as stupid as Tom Schatz?</LD>
<LD>   Mr. Schatz is upset that the U.S. Postal Service is spending .04%
of its annual budget to sponsor the No. 1 cyclist in the world, Lance
Armstrong, and his team. Yes, that's .04% not 4%. Nevertheless, Mr.
Schatz complains that even this minuscule devotion of resources is
wasteful government spending.</LD>
<LD>   However, as the article itself clearly states, the U.S. Postal
Service is not government subsidized nor has it been since 1971. So
what in the world is Tom Schatz complaining about and why is the L.A.
Times giving him a forum?</LD>

billion in added revenue, costs every American family 45 cents a
month, tell me where to send a check for 0.23 cents to government
watchdog Tom Schatz so he can get over the $6.25 million "wasted" by
the U.S Postal Service to keep Lance Armstrong &amp; Co. kicking butt in
the Tour de France.</TE>

It's another black eye for baseball, baseball fans and the lovers of

<LD>J.A. Adande's July 18 column was way off base in terms of his request
that Tiger Woods get involved in the cause for women's rights.
Tiger's business is playing golf, not crusading for causes.</LD>

members of the club, rather than Tiger? Let Tiger play golf and win

<TE>   These exclusionary rules were not formulated by people of African

European descent. So, wouldn't it be more fitting for the protests to
come from others of the same ilk? How about Nicklaus, Palmer, Watson,
Montgomerie, Mickelson, Duval, Couples? They are the Caucasian
counterparts of the myopic members who make and enforce those stupid
restrictions. Let's hear from them!</TE>

something, anything to pressure certain "private" golf clubs to allow
women. Let me say that again--private golf clubs. Is nothing sacred
anymore?</TE>

the National Council of Women's Organizations include men on its
board? If they don't they should, but who has the power to tell them

<HD>Cycle Crash Kills Busch Driver Kirby</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WHITE HOUSE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Busch Series driver Andy Kirby was killed when the motorcycle he was
driving ran off a road and hit a tree, police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Kirby, 40, lost control of his motorcycle on a curve at about
11:30 p.m. Thursday, according to a report filed by Trooper Joseph
Agee of the Tennessee Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   Kirby was wearing a helmet but driving at a high speed, Department
of Safety spokesman Beth Tucker Womack said Friday. The cycle slid
about 174 feet before leaving the road, then another 42 feet into the
tree.</LD>
<TE>   No drug or alcohol involvement was suspected, and weather didn't
seem to be a factor, she said. There were no witnesses to the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Kirby, ranked 36th in the standings, started 12 Busch races this
year. He occasionally drove for Jay Robinson Racing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically in shock," said Curtis Aldridge, a spokesman for
Jay Robinson Racing. "He was an excellent driver, a huge talent who
just needed the right break--just needed a car to drive every week to
show people what he could do."</TE>

<HD>Angels Are All Business</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They show Seattle they deserve to be taken
seriously, getting 20 hits in 15-3 victory that ends 12-game home
losing streak against Mariners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels were not swaggering after their 15-3 victory over the
Seattle Mariners Friday night at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   One victory in their last 13 home games against the defending
American League West champions is nothing to boast about.</LD>
<LD>   Still, there was no discounting the boost in confidence the Angels
provided themselves and a sellout crowd of 43,407 with their sharp
performance against the Mariners in the opener of a three-game
series.</LD>
<TE>   Right-hander Ramon Ortiz outpitched Seattle ace Freddy Garcia and
was backed by a 20-hit attack that helped the Angels move to within
three games of the first-place Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing we were able to do was put pressure every inning on
a very good pitcher," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon went five for five with a three-run homer against
reliever Mark Watson during an eight-run sixth inning. Salmon also
had a sacrifice fly and finished with five runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson had two doubles, a single and drove in two runs
and David Eckstein had three hits and three RBIs. Darin Erstad
returned to the lineup after missing three games and had two hits and
scored three runs. Designated hitter Brad Fullmer had two hits and
two RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   That was more than enough for Ortiz (9-7), who rebounded from a
horrible start last Sunday at Kansas City, giving up two runs and
seven hits in seven innings against the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed this game," said Ortiz, who won for the first time since
June 21.</TE>
<TE>   It was a pivotal victory for a team that overcame the worst start
in franchise history to climb back into the race for the AL West
title.</TE>
<TE>   That road to recovery was forged, for the most part, against teams
outside the division. So the Angels were eager to test themselves
against a team that beat them 15 times in 19 games last season, swept
them in four games at Edison Field April 8-11 this year and won two
of three at Seattle April 22-24.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn did not
downplay the series' significance.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if they really see us as a threat and I think it's
important for us to go out there and show them that we are," said
Washburn, who will start the series finale on Sunday. "We're here and
we're for real.... Taking two out of three or sweeping this series
would be huge for us and maybe open their open their eyes a little
and maybe make them start worrying a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had reason to be concerned with Garcia on the mound for
the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Star right-hander entered the game 6-1 in nine career
starts against the Angels and 4-0 at Edison Field. His 1.84
earned-run average against the Angels was his lowest against any
American League team other than the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels scored twice in the first inning, three times in
the fourth and once in the fifth before Garcia was replaced by
Watson, who have up the eight runs in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia (11-6) gave up 11 hits in 4 2/3 innings, his third-shortest
outing this season.</TE>
<TE>   "He was throwing hard," said Salmon, who had five hits for the
first time since May 13, 1994, when he did it against the Mariners at
Seattle. "Any time you can chip away and keep building and get a run
here and there and have Ramon shut them down, that was the
difference."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz came into the game winless in his last four starts,
including Sunday's disastrous outing at Kansas City, where he was
bombed for nine runs and seven hits in two innings.</TE>
<TE>   But Ortiz gave up only run-scoring singles to Dan Wilson in the
second inning and Mark McLemore in the seventh. He struck out eight.</TE>
<TE>   "He had to work for it against a good team--it wasn't as easy as
it might have looked," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "He got a lot of support, but early in the game it could have been
a lot different. They had some opportunities and he pitched out of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon drove in a run with a broken-bat single in the first,
singled in the second and drove in a run with a sacrifice fly in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Then he capped the eight-run sixth with his 15th homer, a
three-run shot to center field, and added a single in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, Scioscia and other Angel players were happy to get the
victory, but recognized that the rest of the series is likely to be
closer.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be more like it usually is--a battle," second baseman
Adam Kennedy said. "We have to jump out early again. That was key."</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>Woods Not Taking This One by Storm</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>

<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>For Friday's second round of the British Open, Tiger Woods chose an
all-black ensemble, possibly in sympathy for the weather, because the
color of the clouds that hung heavily over Muirfield was nearly a
perfect match.</LD>
<LD>   The weather would not have been judged especially bad, if it were,
say, January, but because it is the middle of July and it is
supposedly summer and Woods is out here doing his best to win the
third part of the Grand Slam, you would be forgiven to have wished
for something cheerier than cold and damp.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Tiger probably wished he could have wrung a couple more
birdies out of his round of 68. Three shots out of the lead when the
day began, Woods moved up a notch and was only two shots out of the
lead when it ended. At this rate, he'll be in a playoff Sunday
afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Chances are that would suit Woods just fine, although he knows
there is a lot more work to do to get that far. By 7 p.m., he was
back at the driving range, checking out his swing. Here's a better
idea. Tiger probably should send somebody out to check on a few of
the greens, such as the par-five ninth, where he putted for an eagle
from just off the green and wound up only with par.</TE>
<TE>   There were two other tricky ones, the par-four 15th and par-three
16th, where both times he stood over birdie putts only to watch the
ball find part of the hole and spin back.</TE>
<TE>   If things had been just a little different, Tiger would be in the
lead and he knows it. But when he assessed his first two days at
Muirfield, Woods was not upset or angry or unfulfilled. In fact, he
admitted to feeling a certain comfort level that almost seemed to
surprise him.</TE>
<TE>   And yet what should really have surprised Woods was that no one
really ran away with the tournament to force him to make up too much
ground too quickly. Muirfield is not a course you can slam dunk, but
as Colin Montgomerie proved with his 64, it can occasionally give up
a low score if you don't try to force it.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Woods doesn't have to do that. He hasn't played his
best yet and he's still only an arm's length from the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Warm and enthusiastic applause greeted Woods when he walked up the
18th fairway with Shigeki Maruyama and Justin Rose alongside him.
Woods acknowledged the crowd by taking off his cap, then waving.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Woods draws the largest galleries at Muirfield and
interest in him is high, judging by the crowds and the amount of
newsprint that is devoted to him every day. Even in rural Scotland,
images of Woods seem to be everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   A series of Woods advertising billboards, made of inflatable
rubber, stand along either side of the two-lane A198, just past the
road to Dirleton and before the road leading to Fenton Barns.</TE>
<TE>   How far can Tiger drive?</TE>
<TE>   That's what is printed on the first one on the left side of the
road from the coastal town of North Berwick, with a photo of Tiger
swinging a club wearing his familiar red shirt. The next one is on
the right side and it has this message: Tiger can go further.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the rubber billboards continue to alternate sides of
the road.</TE>
<TE>   A little further.</TE>
<TE>   Further.</TE>
<TE>   Further.</TE>
<TE>   Damn, we ran out of boards.</TE>
<TE>   You know, you really have to hand it to them. As an ad campaign,
the billboards are probably working out well here in the East Lothian
countryside. You really can't miss them. One morning this week, a
whole herd of cattle had gathered in front of the first billboard and
they seemed genuinely interested.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger is the main topic of interest of all creatures as he tries
to capture the third leg of the Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   He said Friday that he's not even thinking about it, which is
probably true when he's on the course. But Woods knows history when
he's making it, so you can be sure he is aware of what is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is generally accorded an edge competitively and
psychologically, and that's by the players trying to beat him. You
can see their point.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, he has already won the first two majors this year,
so Tiger is confident. Tiger's mental edge over his closest
contenders hasn't shown any weakness in the majors, at least not yet.
And who else has inflatable billboards that attract even cattle? Not
Ernie Els.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says his contentment could be traced to the fact that he has
avoided real trouble. He could have double bogeyed the first hole
Thursday, but he made par. He drove into the rough on the par-five
fifth hole Friday, but he caught a break with a trampled-down lie and
made birdie. And after his three-putt par, Woods hit his drive into
the rough at the 10th but saved par by making an uphill 18-footer
with a one-foot break from right to left.</TE>
<TE>   To hear him tell it, it sounded so simple, as if it was all part
of some great plan. It's almost as if he is just biding his time,
waiting for the breaks to come, the putts to fall and the lead to
come to him. There are still two days to find out if Tiger is right,
again.</TE>

<LD>While Tiger Woods tees off on the links at the British Open, golfers
in the Middle East are playing a desert version of the sport notable
for triple-digit temperatures, roaming animals and pungent
sand-and-oil courses.</LD>
<LD>   "No greens here," Laxman Singade, the longtime "brownskeeper" at
the Dubai Country Club, told the Bloomberg News Service.</LD>
<LD>   This version of the sport, created shortly before World War II by
British Oil executives in Iran, is the only officially sanctioned
game played amid wild dogs and lizards chasing golf balls across a
gooey mix of sand and 13,000 gallons of crude oil.</LD>
<TE>   "The perfect brown is built from sand and lightweight crude
generously watered with used engine oil," Singade said. "Some courses
in Saudi Arabia also oil the fairways, but that gets messy."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the last winner of the British Open to lead
from start to finish?</TE>
<TE>   Come fly: Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry, to reporters after
Falcon kickers missed five field-goal attempts in the spring football
game: "Can any of you guys out there kick field goals? ... We'll give
you a free education, we'll give you an F-16 or even an F-22."</TE>
<TE>   His lot in life: Andre Agassi made his only appearance of the
season with the Sacramento Capitals of World TeamTennis on Thursday
night, playing in the parking lot of a suburban mall during a match
against the Springfield Lasers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what it's about for me," Agassi said. "It's bringing
tennis straight to the parking lot. I've never played in a parking
lot before--at least not tennis."</TE>
<TE>   Coaching material: From Jeff Gordon of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch: "After watching video of Allen Iverson's mom dressing
down a pushy reporter, don't you wonder why she never got into
coaching? I mean, wouldn't she spur the [Golden State] Warriors to
get the lead out?"</TE>
<TE>   Blame game: After a portion of Wrigley Field's famed ivy was
destroyed this week, the Chicago Tribune conducted a poll asking fans
who they felt was the most likely culprit. Among those on the ballot
was Bud Selig, with the notation: "Isn't everything his fault?"</TE>
<TE>   Rumor mill: Frank Robinson, denying a report that he had quit as
manager of the Montreal Expos and had to be persuaded to return by
General Manager Omar Minaya: "Rumors--I'm not going to sit here and
answer rumors. Where did it come from? Newark Star-Ledger? Do they
have my office wired?"</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1976, Hank Aaron hit his 755th and
final home run to lead the Milwaukee Brewers to a 6-2 victory over
the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Also on this day, in 1970, Bill Singer of the Dodgers pitched a
no-hitter in a 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies at Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tom Weiskopf, in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Last year, Oregon boosters spent $250,000 to put the
image of quarterback Joey Harrington on a building in New York's
Times Square.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State has poked fun at that publicity stunt by putting
an image of its quarterback, Jason Gesser, on the side of a grain
elevator in the middle of the state's farm region. The 25-by-15-foot
vinyl banner cost the school about $2,500.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>After two rounds of the 131st British Open, the non-discriminatory
list of contenders includes short hitters, long hitters, youngsters
with dreams and veterans who might be closer to AARP membership than
their next PGA Tour victory.</LD>
<LD>   This is the open Open, the only major golf championship where you
don't have to be able to drive the ball from Augusta to oblivion to
contend. At Muirfield, it's not how far you hit the ball; it's how
well you place it.</LD>
<LD>   After Friday's second round, five golfers--Duffy Waldorf, Bob
Tway, Ernie Els of South Africa, Padraig Harrington of Ireland and
Shigeki Maruyama of Japan--are tied for the lead at six-under-par
136. They did what they had to do on this damp, 7,034-yard layout:
carefully keep the ball in play and make some putts.</LD>
<TE>   There are 35 players within four shots of the leaders: Among them
are Des Smyth, a 49-year-old Irishman who is only 121st in driving
distance on the PGA European Tour; 45-year-old Nick Price, who could
barely reach some of the fairways at the U.S. Open in June; Swede
Carl Pettersson, a 24-year-old living in North Carolina hoping to
someday play on the PGA Tour; and Mark O'Meara, another 45-year-old
who doesn't even hit it as far as Price.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Tiger Woods is two off the lead too.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what the Open Championship is all about," Els said about
the varied collection of players near the top.</TE>
<TE>   "This course is set up for a lot of different players. Guys like
Nick Price are going to have a hell of a chance this weekend."</TE>
<TE>   On a mostly calm day with intermittent light rain, Scotland's
Colin Montgomerie turned in the best score with a bogey-free 64, his
12-foot birdie putt on 18 drawing the first loud, sustained cheer out
of the reserved Scots surrounding the 18th green.</TE>
<TE>   He hit his first 11 greens in regulation, eagled the par-five
fifth hole and managed to get around this demanding course with 148
bunkers without dropping a shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to keep this momentum going," said Montgomerie, hoping to
win his first major tournament. "I know I can win. I've never been
frightened of winning, ever. I've never been frightened of winning
here."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie had a dismal 74 on Thursday and thought he might have
shot his way out of the tournament. Then he did what any weekend
hacker would like to do: He changed clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "I went into the car and I found another set and I thought, oh,
bugger, I'll put them in," he said. "They worked."</TE>
<TE>   The 64 was Montgomerie's lowest score in his 13 British Opens.</TE>
<TE>   Els began the tournament not feeling very good about his chances,
but he shot a 66 Friday after a Muirfield-record 29 on the front
nine. He began the day at one under, then birdied Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6,
8 and 9.</TE>
<TE>   Swing coach David Leadbetter has helped him get his mechanics down
in the last few days. The mental side of his game has been left to
Jos Vanstiphout.</TE>
<TE>   "He keeps on grinding stuff into my head," the two-time U.S. Open
winner said of Vanstiphout. "He keeps me positive. He's got a pretty
decent job to do the next couple of days."</TE>
<TE>   Three players trail the leaders by one shot: Pettersson, Smyth and
Soren Hansen of Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   Two behind at 138 are Montgomerie, Woods, Price, O'Meara, Stephen
Ames of Trinidad, Thomas Levet of France, Thomas Bjorn of Denmark and
Ian Poulter of England.</TE>
<TE>   For the second day in a row, Woods had little trouble from tee to
green but plenty of trouble getting putts to drop. He shot a 68.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit some good putts out there that just didn't go in," he said,
echoing his sentiments from Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The group of nine players at three-under 139 includes Retief
Goosen of South Africa, who finished second to Woods at the Masters;
Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland, two-time U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen, Jeff Maggert and Corey Pavin.</TE>
<TE>   Janzen is 138th in driving distance on the tour; Pavin is 194th.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia of Spain is among 10 players at 140, four behind the
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Waldorf, the only one of Thursday's three leaders who held on to
his top spot Friday, played late in the day as crowds began to head
home.</TE>
<TE>   "The 50, 60 people who were watching would have gone crazy," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He eagled the ninth hole on the way to a 69.</TE>
<TE>   Maruyama, playing in the same group with Woods and Justin Rose,
who followed Thursday's 68 with a 75, bogeyed the first hole but
finished at 68 for his share of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   His disposition on the course was as happy-go-lucky as Woods' was
stern, a contagious smile breaking out on bad shots and good.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I do show my anger," Maruyama said through an
interpreter, "like when I go into the woods and kick some trees or
something, but I do it in a way that nobody will notice.</TE>
<TE>   "And I do feel really mad when I miss the putt. However, if I get
angry, that really consumes my energy, and that's the last thing I
want to do."</TE>
<TE>   The secret to his constant smile?</TE>
<TE>   "Nice family," he said, without the interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Tway, the 1986 PGA winner, has missed the cut in his last seven
British Opens but is thrilled about this year's course and how he is
playing.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought I should play well over here, and I never do,"
said Tway, who shot 66. "I always wonder when we come over what we
did wrong in America about designing golf courses....</TE>
<TE>   "At home, all we do is fly [the ball] to a position and fly it to
another position. Here you have a lot of options.... They're more
pleasing to play than sometimes what we play."</TE>
<TE>   There were 39 scores in the 60s Friday, 17 more than Thursday, as
greens became a little softer with the drizzle. The cut came at
two-over 144, which meant Phil Mickelson barely made it after a 76,
but Brad Faxon, Tom Lehman, Vijay Singh, Jim Furyk, Hal Sutton, John
Daly and Tom Watson are among those who now have their weekend free.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast calls for increasing wind, a links-golf element that
has been missing so far. Most expect the course to stand up just
fine, regardless of the weather.</TE>
<TE>   "If we ever get a day where it blows here," Woods said, "it will
be interesting."</TE>

<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>All Phil Mickelson needs to win his first major championship is to
shoot a couple of 64s and get an extra-large bucket of help from the
rest of the field and the erratic Scottish weather.</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson, who has spent more than a year refining his game to fit
the links courses where the British Open is staged, double-bogeyed
Muirfield's first hole Friday, stumbled to a six-over-par 76 and
barely made the cut at 144.</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson is eight shots behind the five leaders, trails 67
players and doesn't feel particularly comfortable swinging the club,
all of which means the Claret Jug is just one more Grand Slam trophy
that probably won't be sitting on his mantel this summer.</LD>
<TE>   "It's disappointing, but it's only two rounds," he said, sounding
an optimistic tone. "I'm not out of it."</TE>
<TE>   He knows he'll need almost divine assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to make a big charge, hope I have perfect weather in the
morning and the wind picks up in the afternoon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson hit his first drive in the rough, tried to hit a
seven-iron out of the knee-high, thick grass and barely moved the
ball. He appeared to injure his left arm, but then hit a wedge out to
the fairway.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a stinger up my arm," he said. "Not just then, but every
time I hit it out of the rough."</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't put himself into birdie position for most of the rest
of the round.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt like I was hitting it poorly, but I never got to the
point where I could just stand up and rip it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson has eight top-10 finishes in majors since the start of
the 1999 season and had hoped this tournament would be his
breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   Radio commentators here on the BBC broadcast of the tournament
referred to Mickelson as the Colin Montgomerie of America. On Friday,
with Montgomerie shooting a seven-under 64 in his chase for his first
major championship, Mickelson can only wish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Muirfield club members announced that Montgomerie's 64 was a
course record, even though Isao Aoki shot a 63 in the 1980 Open here.</TE>
<TE>   The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers determined that
because the fourth and 13th holes were lengthened for this
championship, Montgomerie's score would be considered the new
standard on the revised layout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The course played differently Friday than it did Thursday, with
the wind changing direction. How big a difference?</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of hitting a three-iron and seven-iron," Montgomerie said
of the first hole, "it was a three-wood and a three-iron."</TE>
<TE>   And that's the difference on two days without substantial wind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After shooting a disappointing 72 in the opening round, Darren
Clarke of Northern Ireland knew he needed some help getting the ball
in the hole.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked onto the putting green at 10 past 6 and walked off at 10
past 9 and was on the putting green at 6 o'clock this morning for
another hour and a half," Clarke said. Teacher Peter Cowen worked
with him as Clarke hit putts one-handed with each hand.</TE>
<TE>   "He missed dinner as well," Clarke said of Cowen.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke shot a four-under 67 Friday and is at three-under 139.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some of the interesting pairings in today's third round: Greg
Norman and David Duval; Justin Rose and Justin Leonard; Tiger Woods
and Scotland roommate Mark O'Meara, Nick Price and Montgomerie; and
the final pairing, at 3:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. Pacific time), Shigeki
Maruyama and Ernie Els.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last eight winners of the British Open were first-time winners
of the event, dating to Norman's win at Sandwich in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another reminder why you can't believe anything you read in the
British tabloids, this headline from the Sun: "Rose will win it, says
Tiger."</TE>
<TE>   Actually he didn't. What Woods did say about Rose was that he had
the talent to win the British Open someday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Think there isn't anything new to say about Woods? ESPN.com is
running an on-line poll to choose a favorite Tiger, other than Woods.
The list includes Tony the Tiger, Dave "Tiger" Williams, Tiger Lilly
from "Peter Pan," Tiger, the dog from "Brady Bunch," Exxon's Tiger,
Siegfried and Roy's white tigers and Al Kaline.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Open Championship is expected to bring in as much as $52.5
million to the local economy, according to a travel estimate, but the
Royal and Ancient has set a higher figure of more than double that.
In a normal year, one without an Open staged in Scotland, golf adds
an estimated $155 million to the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The weather forecasters, who accurately predicated rain Friday,
are going out on a limb and saying that it will also rain today, but
with a chance of clearing later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He played an eight-hole stretch in five under on his way to a 69,
but Andrew Coltart played in the second group of the day and his 7:11
a.m. tee time (11:11 p.m. PDT Thursday night) was during the worst
weather--cold, wet, breezy.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coltart: "It was pretty miserable."</TE>

<HD>They Try to Get the Point Across</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Clippers finally have European point guard
standout Jaric, but it's not certain he will be eventual starter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers couldn't say with any certainty Friday whether Marko
Jaric would be their starting point guard next season. They wouldn't
say whether they have seen the last of Jeff McInnis, their starter
the last two seasons. And they refused to say whether they are still
seeking a trade for a standout such as Andre Miller of the Cleveland
Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   Here's what is known:</LD>
<LD>   Jaric is signed, sealed, delivered and looking forward to his
first NBA training camp, which opens for the Clippers on Oct. 1 at
Palm Desert. Meanwhile, Jaric has started workouts with the Yugoslav
national team in Germany in preparation of the World Championships,
which begin Aug. 29 in Indianapolis.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, it's so hard to say," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said when
asked if Jaric would replace McInnis, a free agent. "I've watched a
lot of tape of him. He's the type of player we're looking for. He
pushes the ball up the court. He's a better defender than people
might think. We think he can contribute to our team."</TE>
<TE>   Asked the same question, General Manager Elgin Baylor said: "His
size gives him an advantage. He's got the ability to shoot over
smaller point guards. He can help rebound. We like his toughness.
He's an aggressive player, a good shooter. I think he can be an even
better shooter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an unselfish player."</TE>
<TE>   Jaric, 23, also is a more worldly player than many of his new
teammates. He was born in Belgrade. His father, Srecko, played for
the Yugoslav national team in the 1960s. Jaric was selected in the
second round (30th overall) in the 2000 draft, but has been playing
in Italy. He recently was featured in the Italian edition of GQ
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Jaric averaged 15.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.6
assists in 33 games for Italian League champion Kinder Bologna.</TE>
<TE>   A five-minute videotape supplied by the Clippers showcased Jaric's
ability to pass to open teammates while on the run and a willingness
to pass before shooting. Jaric also appears to have a textbook jump
shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a point guard who is not a scorer," Jaric said via a
conference call with reporters Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Of his relatively low assist totals throughout his career, Jaric
said, "Assists [are credited] completely differently in Europe. In
Europe nobody gets more than five assists [per game]. It's like
having 10 or 15 in the NBA. I'll be very interested to see how
assists are [credited] in the NBA because I think it's going to be
very different."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis averaged 14.6 points, 6.2 assists and 2.6 rebounds in 81
games last season, but clashed occasionally with his teammates and
Gentry. He is an unrestricted free agent, free to sign with any team,
including the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers tried to trade for Miller, who averaged a
league-leading 10.9 assists last season for the Cavaliers, but the
deal collapsed June 26, the night of the NBA draft. An attempt to
acquire Baron Davis from the New Orleans Hornets also was
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, the Clippers have only Jaric at the point.</TE>
<TE>   Keyon Dooling, sidelined for 68 games last season because of a
badly sprained left ankle, underwent an arthroscopic procedure Friday
in Oakland. Dooling is expected to sit out for at least the next six
weeks, but he should be fit in time for the opening of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It solidifies us, gives us more size, more depth," Baylor said of
adding Jaric. "Marko doesn't have NBA experience, but he has a lot of
basketball experience. This does help us. It makes us stronger in
that position, but I'm not saying what else we might do."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Miss Big Chance</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Bonds is injured and L.A. wastes a golden
opportunity in the 11th inning, then Giants win it in the 12th, 3-2,
on a single by Goodwin.</DH>

<LD>The Dodgers, with a payroll in excess of $100 million, might not be
able to buy their way into the playoffs this season, but if the San
Francisco Giants beat them out for a postseason berth, the Dodgers
can stake a financial claim to their success.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Goodwin, who was released by the Dodgers coming out of spring
training and is being paid about $3.5 million by the Dodgers not to
play for them, beat his former team with an RBI single in the top of
the 12th inning Friday night, lifting the Giants to a 3-2 victory
before a Dodger Stadium sellout crowd of 53,033.</LD>
<LD>   After the Dodgers failed to score after Eric Karros' leadoff
triple in the bottom of the 11th, J.T. Snow led off the top of the
12th with a single off Dodger reliever Guillermo Mota. David Bell's
sacrifice bunt moved Snow to second, and Snow took third on Rich
Aurilia's grounder to second.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers walked Jeff Kent intentionally to pitch to Goodwin,
who replaced injured slugger Barry Bonds in the 11th, and Goodwin,
who rarely showed much discipline at the plate as a Dodger, slapped
an RBI single to left to break a 2-2 tie.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco closer Robb Nen then retired the side in order in
the bottom of the 12th, sending the Dodgers to their ninth loss in 10
games and 11th loss in 14.</TE>
<TE>   Nen worked out of what seemed like an impossible jam in the 11th.
Karros led off with a long drive to the gap in left-center, a ball
that center fielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo appeared to have a bead on but
failed to catch on the warning track.</TE>
<TE>   The ball caromed high off the wall, giving the lead-footed Karros
the 10th triple of his career and first since May 26, 1998. Bonds,
the Giants' left fielder, pulled up on the play and strained his
right hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds walked off the field under his own power and was replaced by
Goodwin, and Karros was replaced by pinch-runner Dave Roberts. Nen
got Brian Jordan to bounce to third, with Roberts holding, and
Marquis Grissom and Adrian Beltre were walked intentionally to load
the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Nen then struck out pinch-hitter Chad Kreuter for the second out
and got Alex Cora to ground to first to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, in their deepest hitting funk of the season, needed
some superb pitching by starter Kazuhisa Ishii and relievers Giovanni
Carrara and Eric Gagne to get the game into extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii ended a Dodger four-game losing streak in his last start,
throwing 7 2/3 innings of shutout ball in a 2-1 victory over Arizona
on Sunday night, and the sellout crowd hoped for a repeat performance
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii didn't disappoint, limiting the Giants to two runs and three
hits in a sometimes-shaky six-inning performance, in which he walked
six and struck out four, but he could do no better than a no-decision
against San Francisco left-hander Kirk Rueter, who countered with his
own six-inning, two-run, seven-hit performance.</TE>
<TE>   Carrara and Giant reliever Jay Witasick also offset each other
with two scoreless innings apiece, though the Dodgers did mount a
minor threat in the eighth when Shawn Green led off with a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Karros worked the count full and took what he thought was ball
four, a pitch that looked low and away to Karros but was close enough
for umpire Terry Craft to call for strike three.</TE>
<TE>   Green, running with the pitch, was thrown out by catcher Benito
Santiago at second for a double play, and Karros gave Craft an earful
on the way back to the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, who hadn't pitched in five days, relieved Carrara to start
the ninth and struck out the side, including Shawon Dunston with a
new-look, 73-mph curve. But Giant reliever Tim Worrell blanked the
Dodgers in the bottom of the ninth, sending the game into extra
innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers broke a 1-1 tie in the fourth inning when Jordan
doubled to the gap in right-center--the Dodgers' first extra-base hit
in three games--and scored on Grissom's single to right, giving the
Dodgers their first lead in 26 innings, dating back to the fourth
inning of Tuesday's 9-2 loss to St. Louis.</TE>

<HD>Flap Over Judges Precedes Fight</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Commission replaces judge for tonight's
Mosley-Forrest bout after protest from World Boxing Council.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Twenty-four hours before the first punch is thrown in tonight's
welterweight title fight at Conseco Fieldhouse between Shane Mosley
and Vernon Forrest, another battle was being waged over the men who
might decide the outcome.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. John McCain, the World Boxing Council, the International
Boxing Federation and the Indiana Boxing Commission were all involved
in a dispute over the judges.</LD>
<LD>   The WBC, which is sanctioning the bout, threatened to pull out,
according to a letter released by McCain Friday, unless two of the
judges, who have worked a series of IBF fights, were replaced.
Forrest was stripped of the IBF welterweight crown in January before
his fight against Mosley.</LD>
<TE>   Judges are not selected by sanctioning organizations, but certain
judges are identified with those organizations because they work
their fights so often.</TE>
<TE>   Although there was no hint of wrongdoing in this case, the Indiana
Boxing Commission met again and voted to replace judge Fred Jones,
whom it had already selected, with Tony Castellano, according to
McCain.</TE>
<TE>   "The WBC's influence on the Indiana Boxing Commission's selection
of officials is not only inappropriate," wrote the Arizona Republican
Senator in a letter released Friday, "but it is exactly the type of
conduct that is destroying the credibility of the sport of
professional boxing in the eyes of the public."</TE>
<TE>   WBC President Jose Sulaiman was unavailable for comment Friday,
but he had already responded to the controversy in a commission
newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   "The WBC does not impose its choice of officials upon a commission
or affiliated member," wrote Sulaiman. "In the case of our good
friends in Indiana, we nominated over a dozen officials, of which the
Indiana commission--and only the Indiana commission--appointed those
to judge the fight with our full cooperation, support and approval."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana Boxing Commission President William Kelsey was not
reachable for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last Jan. 26, Mosley stepped into the ring at The Theater in
Madison Square Garden and the boxing world sat back to watch the
seemingly inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   At 30, Mosley was regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter in
the world. He was unbeaten at 38-0 with 35 knockouts. And he was
seemingly unchallenged, with no discernable threat on the horizon. He
had dominated the lightweight division, then made a Herculean leap up
two weight classes to beat Oscar De La Hoya at 147 pounds. And only
four months earlier, the only other fighter who might have beaten
Mosley, Felix Trinidad, had been soundly beaten by Bernard Hopkins at
160 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   In front of Mosley that night was Forrest, also undefeated at 33-0
with 26 knockouts. Forrest had beaten Mosley 10 years earlier, but
that was in their amateur days.</TE>
<TE>   This was the big leagues. Surely, Mosley's unsurpassed speed and
surprising power would overwhelm Forrest as it had so many others.</TE>
<TE>   And indeed, that's what happened in the first round. Mosley danced
and poked and peppered Forrest, delivering as promised.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the start of the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the head butt.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the end for Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   After he butted heads with Forrest, Mosley, dazed and bloodied,
was knocked down twice in that round and never fully recovered, going
on to lose a unanimous decision. The only solace Mosley could take
from that fight was the fact he hadn't been knocked out.</TE>
<TE>   That, however, did little to ease the harsh reality of his first
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Mosley will get the chance to avenge that loss.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley will try to prove the difference in the first fight was the
head butt. Forrest will try to prove that--head butt or no head
butt--he is the superior fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley raised a lot of eyebrows when he signed for an immediate
rematch. Fighters who take the type of beating Mosley absorbed are
advised to step back, take a few tune-up fights, rebuild their
confidence and readjust their fight plan.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley wouldn't hear of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see myself knocking out another poor fool," Mosley said,
"because I'm mad at Vernon Forrest. I can't see myself taking out the
fire and the heat, whatever I have inside of me, on another person. I
can't do that. That's not right for the other person."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neither fighter made the required weight of 147 pounds the first
time around at Friday's weigh-in at the Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping on a digital scale, Forrest weighed 147.3 pounds, Mosley
147.1, a tenth representing 1.6 ounces. Forrest stripped off his
shorts, getting down to 147.1. Mosley did the same and qualified at
146.9.</TE>
<TE>   Given two hours to make weight, Forrest returned 30 minutes later
and weighed in at 147.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of the undercard, which consists of nine bouts, will
be the semi-main event between light heavyweights Antonio Tarver
(19-1, 16) and Eric Harding (21-1-1, 7).</TE>
<TE>   Although Tarver is the mandatory challenger for undisputed
champion Roy Jones, Jr., Tarver agreed to risk that position by
facing Harding, the only man to beat him.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 12,000 seats having already been sold in the
18,500-seat arena, officials are holding out hope for a sellout.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Feeling Jones' Influence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the Galaxy players are beginning to get their legs under them,
they are also building some momentum two games before Major League
Soccer's All-Star break.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Sigi Schmid knows why his team has won three of its last
four matches, including Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup game, after losing
five of its previous seven.</LD>
<LD>   The return of team captain Cobi Jones from U.S. national team duty
at the World Cup and other players healing from earlier injuries have
helped the Galaxy develop a sense of continuity as it prepares to
play the Kansas City Wizards tonight at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   "It's important that we establish a rhythm and it's important that
you play your best soccer as you approach the end of the season, as
you approach the playoffs," Schmid said. "But more important than
anything is having everybody back together. I think Cobi's been a
real positive influence for our team ... not only on the field but
his leadership off the field has been very good for the younger
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, 32, the U.S.'s all-time appearance leader with 158 and a
veteran of three World Cups, said leading comes naturally.</TE>
<TE>   "Being one of the veteran players on this team and with the
experience that I have," he said, "there's not going to be that many
players my age, especially within MLS or even around the world, that
are going to have the type of experience that I have, with all the
World Cups and all the tournaments that we've played in. So that
definitely is something that comes naturally. But also, with that
experience comes responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   In the Galaxy's 3-1 win at Colorado last week, Jones teamed with
another veteran, playmaking midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, to
jump-start the previously stagnant Galaxy offense.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had three assists, tying for most in his career, against the
Rapids. Cienfuegos, making his first start since June 15, had two
assists.</TE>
<TE>   "That was [a credit to our] experience and we've played with each
other so long," Jones said. "But I think over all the years that was
the first time we've played in those two offensive midfield positions
together. That was a great experience for both of us, and we worked
well together. I'd like to see it again in the future some time."</TE>
<TE>   How about tonight?</TE>
<TE>   "That's up to the big man," Jones said as he gestured toward
Schmid.</TE>
<TE>   But Schmid said he had not decided on a lineup, a challenge that
became greater with Cienfuegos' solid play and Simon Elliott's return
from the Oceania Nations Cup, where he helped lead his native New
Zealand to the title.</TE>
<TE>   Still, fellow midfielder Sasha Victorine is slowed by a strained
right hamstring and that may open the door for a midfield of Jones,
who took a knock on his left Achilles' tendon Wednesday, Cienfuegos
and Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we play in the same manner that we played
last week," Schmid said, "that we keep possession of the ball and we
look for opportunities down the flanks."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jones: "I think we're still at the beginning stages of
[building momentum] right now so I can't quite feel it all. I think
we need to win a few more games, though, and roll into the All-Star
game with two more victories, and that would be perfect."</TE>

<HD>Judge Awards Jockeys Millions</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Pincay, McCarron get almost $9 million from
lawsuit filed more than 10 years ago against their former business
managers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Los Angeles has awarded jockey Laffit Pincay and
recently retired rider Chris McCarron almost $9 million in
compensatory and punitive damages stemming from a lawsuit they
brought against their former business managers more than 10 years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. ordered the Vincent Andrews
Management Corp., which has an office in New York, to pay Pincay
$5,758,253 and McCarron $3,074,809. In 1992, a jury in Los Angeles
found Vincent Andrews and his brother Robert, who had represented
Pincay for 19 years and McCarron for nine, guilty of breach of
contract, intentional and negligent misrepresentation and concealment
and breach of fiduciary duty. At that time, the Andrews appealed a
combined jury award of $4.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a big victory," Neil Papiano, an attorney for the
jockeys, said Friday. "The larger amounts are the result of interest
on the original award, and an increase in the punitive damages. I
would assume that there will be an appeal."</LD>
<TE>   Attempts to reach an attorney for the Andrewses were unsuccessful.
After the 1992 trial, Vincent Andrews said that Pincay and McCarron
had netted almost $2 million in tax savings from their investments,
adding that those investments were then valued at $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Papiano said Pincay had invested $1.3 million and paid the Andrews
firm $449,844 in management fees. McCarron's outlay included $759,000
in investments and $369,906 in fees. Both riders are in the Racing
Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay, 55, was enshrined in 1975. Currently riding at Hollywood
Park, he had won a record 9,388 races before Friday night's racing.
McCarron, 47, was elected into the Hall of Fame in 1989. When he
retired June 23, McCarron had ridden 7,141 winners and his horses had
earned a record $264.3 million in purses.</TE>
<TE>   The jockeys' investments included a hotel in Hawaii, a shopping
center in Florida, townhouses in Ohio, oil and gas drilling in West
Virginia and a proposed movie with the working title of "Hunchback of
the Morgue." In management fees, Pincay and McCarron paid the Andrews
firm 5% of their gross income.</TE>
<TE>   "That sounded kind of high," McCarron testified at the trial. "But
it seemed like standard, so I went for it. Vinnie [Andrews] came
across as a very trusting person."</TE>
<TE>   Pincay testified that before the breakup he had considered
including Vincent Andrews in his will.</TE>
<TE>   "The case boiled down to a scheme of concealment to misrepresent
and exploit a couple of athletes who were not financial experts,"
Papiano said.</TE>
<TE>   The Panamanian-born Pincay's connection with Vincent Andrews
Management began in 1969, his fourth year of riding in the U.S., when
he signed on with the brothers' father. Pincay dropped the Andrews
firm in 1987. McCarron hooked up with the firm about a year after he
moved his base from Maryland to Southern California in 1978. He left
the Andrews brothers in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The Andrews brothers represented other Hall of Fame jockeys,
including Bill Shoemaker, Angel Cordero and Jorge Velasquez. In his
1988 autobiography, Shoemaker said:</TE>
<TE>   "Vinnie [Andrews] was easy to talk to, and he wasn't a smart....
Maybe he was even a little too conservative, but he read the riot act
to [Shoemaker and his then-wife Cindy]. He said from now on he was
running our money drawer.... Now when I have a business decision to
make, I call Vinnie. He gives me straight answers."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview several years ago, Cordero discussed his
relationship with the Andrews brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "They were charging me 4% of gross earnings," he said. "But it
turned out to be more like 8%. They didn't do right by me...."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Park's 65-day meet ends this weekend with cards that
include today's $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile and Sunday's $250,000
Sunset Handicap. Southern California's virtual year-round major-track
schedule continues Wednesday, when Del Mar launches a 43-day season.</TE>

<HD>It's No Act</HD>
<DH>Priestley isn't giving up Hollywood, but he's testing his
skills in IRL developmental series</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Celebrities are nothing new to auto racing. Paul Newman and Gene
Hackman are among the biggest stars to get behind the wheel, and
Motley Crue lead singer Vince Neil took a run in the old Indy Lights
Series, a breeding ground for some of today's top drivers. But Jason
Priestley is accelerating into uncharted territory for a Hollywood
figure. The star of "Beverly Hills 90210" is racing against the next
generation of Indianapolis 500 drivers.</LD>
<LD>   Competing in Kansas earlier this month at speeds nearly three
times the legal limit of the San Diego Freeway, Priestley finished
second to one of racing's most famous names--A.J. Foyt IV, grandson
of the four-time Indy winner--in the Infiniti Pro Series, a newly
formed developmental series for the Indy Racing League.</LD>
<LD>   A crash took out three of the top five cars just 20 laps from the
finish, but Priestley was running in the group within a second of the
leader. Priestley, 32, "hanging back in fifth to see what would
happen," avoided the crash by slipping under it. Just as telling was
his performance before the race--he qualified third in the field of
12.</LD>
<TE>   It was his first oval race. His second comes today at Nashville
Superspeedway. He qualified fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thrilled," team owner Tom Kelley said. "I was hoping [he'd]
go there and come home with the car in once piece--that would have
been a victory. He was very competitive, he made some good passes, he
learned a lot, and I think every race he'll improve."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Al Unser Jr. or Scott Sharp--Kelley's IRL drivers--should
be looking over their shoulders. Unlike many he is racing against,
Priestley is not being groomed for open wheel oval racing's highest
level, Kelley said. But that doesn't mean the actor isn't taking his
new role seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "To say I do this as a hobby is disrespectful to the other
drivers, to other teams," Priestley said. "This is professional
racing. We race for money. I've got another job I do as well, but for
a lot of people, this is how they make their living."</TE>
<TE>   Race engineer Ray Gosselin is one of them. He has worked with such
talented drivers as Sharp, Mark Dismore, Tony Kanaan, two-time Indy
500 winner Helio Castroneves and the late Greg Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "We want him to lead races and win races," Gosselin said. "No
one's going to be happy if he comes home 10th. No one's going to be
happy if he comes home second. We want him to win races."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley's commitment to racing has impressed those in the
paddock. He worked on two movies the last two months--"Die Mommy
Die!" a black comedy that he assures won't be straight-to-video
despite its title, and "The True Meaning of Christmas." On days off
from shooting, he participated in three tests in the car. He admits
he will go as far as the asphalt will take him, even if it leads to
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd definitely be open to the opportunity," Priestley said. "I
wouldn't be so arrogant to say I could get in one of those cars
tomorrow; that's just not the case. But if that opportunity came,
it's an opportunity I would relish."</TE>
<TE>   Spoken like a true racer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll give that to him, he's very focused on what's going on at
the track," said Gosselin, who along with driver coach Tony Renna
will have the greatest impact on Priestley's development. "His
excitement and enthusiasm level is right where it needs to be; he's
putting forth the effort and commitment to do the best he can.</TE>
<TE>   "He's shown he wants to get better. He's willing to listen and
learn. When he's not running, he's watching the other cars, seeing
what lines they're running, what their brake points are ....I don't
think there are a lot of people who are expecting too much, but I
think he's expecting a lot of himself."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kelley: "Jason's got a chance to win the series, and I'm not
sure I thought that 90 days ago."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley Racing's new sponsor, HomeMed Pharmacy, wanted a driver who
could bring it immediate attention. In a developmental series,
finding that kind of driver can be a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to find a person we thought could be competitive and bring
our sponsor instant recognition, and we thought [Priestley] would be
a good fit," Kelley said. "This is a serious deal, with cars that go
180 mph. This is not a road course where you run off on gravel.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a lot of soul searching on this. We told Jason, 'We know
you want to do this, but this is not just a thrill, this is a job.' "</TE>
<TE>   There are risks.</TE>
<TE>   The walls don't take kindly to these Indy-style cars, which don't
have coverings over their wheels and have open cockpits. Priestley
qualified in the season-opening event at Kansas Speedway at 177.988
mph; by comparison, Jason Leffler qualified first for last year's
NASCAR Winston Cup stock car race at Kansas at 176.449 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't Gene Hackman or Paul Newman racing sports cars," said
Roger Bailey, director of the Infiniti Pro Series. "This is very
serious stuff. My first impressions are that he may not be a world
champion, but he won't be a hazard."</TE>
<TE>   The studios have an obvious interest in Priestley's continued good
health, especially in the middle of a project. And conflicts?</TE>
<TE>   "Racing has been a part of my life for 11 years so when I work on
a new entertainment project, they know all the aspects of my life and
my activities," Priestley said. "If there is a conflict, we deal with
them as they occur.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the statistics, I have a better chance of being
injured in my rental car getting to the track than I do in the race
car."</TE>
<TE>   Newman is among the most committed celebrities to racing. He
continues to drive occasionally, and with Carl Haas co-owns cars
driven by Cristiano da Matta and Christian Fittipaldi in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series, a rival to the IRL.</TE>
<TE>   Other celebrities have also raced, usually sports cars, including
Steve McQueen, Robert Carradine, James Brolin, Craig T. Nelson, Tim
Allen, Kent McCord, Robert Hays, Perry King, Lorenzo Lamas, Jason
Bateman, Sean Patrick Flanery, Alfonso Ribeiro and Mark-Paul
Gosselaar.</TE>
<TE>   Neil's experience in Indy Lights is perhaps closest to what
Priestley is experiencing, but he competed in only a handful of races
in the 1992 season and also drove road courses.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these people, they find they're not going to make money
racing cars, they're going to spend a lot, and they realize they
better stick to acting," said Danny McKeever, who has taught
celebrities to drive for the Pro-Celebrity race at the Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Priestley, too, was in the Pro-Celebrity race. He finished fifth
among the celebrities, and sixth overall, in the 1995 race. "If Jason
is doing this and stepping up to the plate in this type of series, he
has to have a lot of passion and desire--it's obviously not a money
thing," McKeever said. "You have to have a lot of confidence in your
ability and know what your limits are.... That's an awfully big step,
and I give him a lot of credit for doing as well as he did in his
first race."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley's previous experience was in rally cars, which he began
driving in 1992 in Southern California, and sports cars in 1997. He
drove twice in the 24 Hours of Daytona, and twice in the 12 Hours of
Sebring.</TE>
<TE>   His defining moment--as a racer--came in 1998, driving a GT1
Mustang with teammate Scott Maxwell for Multimatic Motorsports at
Laguna Seca.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in a car that wasn't that great, that was two years old,
and we finished third in that race," Priestley said. "That was a
moment I'll always think was a turning point in my career, where I
realized I could do this and could do this at a really high level. On
the podium was the Mercedes factory team, the Lotus factory team, and
us--this little team from Toronto."</TE>
<TE>   If that was his defining moment, one of his lowest came in 1999
after allegedly swerving his Porsche to miss a deer and hitting some
trash cans, a power pole and a parked car.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of drunken driving,
something that's rarely mentioned in the same breath as "professional
race car driver."</TE>
<TE>   "I made a big error in judgment," said Priestley, who was
sentenced to five nights in a work-release facility, had his driver's
license suspended for a year, paid a $700 fine, was ordered to
participate in a three-month alcohol treatment program and serve
three years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot from that whole experience. If you truly learn
from that mistake and change your behavior, it doesn't have to be a
negative thing. If you keep making the mistake, that's indicative of
a problem. Drinking and driving is never a smart thing. I wish it
never would have happened."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley's focus now is on the road in front of him, where his
racing pedigree will be tested by the young lions of the sport who
are, literally, on the fast track to the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   He fits in with the boys but is more susceptible than any of them
to target practice from the "mean-spirited" nature of the Hollywood
tabloids that will probably highlight his every mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of pressure on me--as my notoriety helps me in some
respects, if I start making mistakes, it becomes a bigger thing,"
Priestley said. "The rest of the [entertainment] media wants to get
in the fray and talk about what a moron I am because that's what
helps sell papers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the gig. There will always be critics or detractors.
There's nothing I can do about that but work hard, do the right
thing, and conduct myself as a professional."</TE>

<HD>New Laker in No Rush to Take Seat on Bench</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Rookie hoping his shooting and defense will
earn him meaningful playing time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARRILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kareem Rush and Mark Madsen couldn't be more different, but their
role with the Lakers might be similar.</LD>
<LD>   Rush, though, is hoping his rookie season will work out
differently than Madsen's first two seasons did.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting at the end of the bench, waving a towel and grabbing a
drink for Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant aren't at the top of his
agenda.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't talked to Mad Dog about how the bench feels," Rush said
of Madsen, who has averaged 10 minutes in 129 NBA games. "I haven't
done any bench warming. So if it does happen it's going to be a
little uncomfortable at first."</TE>
<TE>   Rush starred as a guard at Missouri and Madsen as a forward at
Stanford. But it didn't take Madsen much time to forget his college
days and embrace a new role in 2000-01 with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Getting bulldozed trying to defend O'Neal in training camp helped
prepare him. So did getting frequent elbows to the face from the
7-foot-1, 330-pound center.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't teach those kinds of things in the classroom at
Stanford," Madsen said. "My first year was an adjustment period
because I was on the bench and it was the first time playing with
bigger bodies and more talented players."</TE>
<TE>   Rush, a wiry 6 feet 6, will face similar challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant is one of the few superstars in the NBA who treats
practices like games. And Rush, who would have been a college senior
this upcoming NBA season, says he's ready to learn, especially on the
defensive side.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to go at Kobe every day [because] I'm trying to get
better," Rush said. "I'm going to show them that I'm not a liability.
That's been a rap of mine, that I don't play defense and that I'm
just a scorer. I'm just looking for ways to earn some playing time."</TE>
<TE>   Rush was a threat in college behind the three-point line, a form
of scoring the Lakers couldn't always count on last season. Rush made
44.8% of his three-pointers as a sophomore and 40.5% as a junior.</TE>
<TE>   "People say that this team lacks that other scorer," said Rush,
who averaged 18.9 points in 84 college games. "I know we have Kobe
and Shaq, but it's kind of inconsistent who scores from there. With
Shaq and Kobe getting double-teamed a lot someone is going to be open
and I think I can knock down the open shot."</TE>
<TE>   Still, with the Lakers having re-signed Devean George on Wednesday
and added veteran shooter Tracy Murray in a June 26 trade with the
Toronto Raptors, Rush will have to be patient.</TE>
<TE>   Rush, the Raptors' 20th pick, also was part of the trade that sent
Lindsey Hunter and the 27th overall pick, Chris Jefferies, from Los
Angeles to Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "[Rush] not only has to learn the triangle offense, but he has to
learn the triangle's toughest position," Laker assistant coach Kurt
Rambis said, referring to guard. "But every time I see him shoot, it
looks as though it's going to go in the basket."</TE>
<TE>   Rush impressed Rambis and Laker management at the Summer Pro
League in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   After averaging 13.5 points and making five of nine three-point
shots in four games, Rush sprained his left (shooting) wrist by
falling awkwardly on it during a game.</TE>
<TE>   Rush sat out the Lakers' final two games, getting a glimpse of
what may be coming in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope not," said Rush, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt while
watching the Lakers warm up for their last game Wednesday. "My wrist
is fine and if I go out there and show that I'm capable of grasping
this offense at a high level and playing defense, then I'll deserve
to play."</TE>

<HD>It's Mosley's Fight to Lose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vernon Forrest is a 6-5 favorite to beat Shane Mosley tonight, but
the betting public is wrong. They were right the first time when they
made Mosley a favorite in January.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing has changed. Mosley still has the tools to be considered
the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. And Forrest is still a
solid but unspectacular fighter who has amassed his impressive record
by beating a bunch of less than spectacular fighters. His biggest
victories were over Vince Phillips and Raul Frank, two fighters more
likely to be found on the list of Who's He? than Who's Who?</LD>
<LD>   Much has been made over whether or not the head butt in the first
Mosley-Forrest fight was a deliberate tactic by Forrest. The better
question in terms of tonight's fight is how much it affected Mosley.</LD>
<TE>   If it seriously dazed and confused him, leading to the two
knockdowns, then tonight's fight must be judged on what would have
happened if there had not been a head butt.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley dominated the first round, showing he was not bothered by
Forrest's style, before the head butt in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming there is no similar head butt tonight, why will anything
be different? Mosley has the speed, the mobility and the mastery of
the ring. He has also devastating power, the result being 35
knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest certainly has the power, best demonstrated by a fearful
right hand. But that power will be useless if he can't zero in on his
target.</TE>
<TE>   Have all those who are predicting a Forrest victory forgotten the
praise heaped on Mosley until January, forgotten all the frustrated
opponents he left swinging at thin air after he turned on the speed,
or gasping for air after he turned on the power?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, if there is another head butt that leaves Mosley in the
twilight zone, he is in trouble. But if not, it is Forrest who will
be in distress.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Mosley to again be Mosley and win by knockout in the 11th
round.</TE>

<HD>Hewitt Pulls Out of the L.A. Field</HD>
<DH>Tennis: The Wimbledon champion, suffering from stomach
virus, withdraws from event at UCLA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to the UCLA tennis jinx, 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Every year, it seems, an injury, illness or fill-in-the-excuse
malady hits the Mercedes-Benz Cup tournament, spiriting away a top
player on the Friday before the event at UCLA's L.A Tennis Center.</LD>
<LD>   Two Grand Slam tournament winners of 2002 were announced as
withdrawals by tournament officials Friday: Wimbledon champion
Lleyton Hewitt of Australia and Australian Open champion Thomas
Johansson of Sweden. Johansson's representatives said Thursday he was
sidelined because of a knee injury.</LD>
<TE>   Hewitt, the world's top-ranked player who is also the defending
U.S. Open champion, is said by his representatives to have a stomach
virus.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, it will just be a matter of days before Lleyton is
ready to resume training and be back on tour," said Tom Ross,
Hewitt's agent. "Lleyton is as disappointed to have had to withdraw
from the Mercedes-Benz Cup as are tournament officials and fans in
Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Ross said Hewitt was not able to practice this week when he was in
Belgium at the home of his girlfriend Kim Clijsters, and added that
Hewitt had little strength and was unable to eat much.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt pulled out of the quarterfinals of a Wimbledon tuneup event
in the Netherlands in June with a similar ailment but was able to
resume practicing the day after the withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   The highest-ranked player remaining in the tournament, which
starts Monday, is Tommy Haas of Germany. Defending champion Andre
Agassi, who defeated Pete Sampras in last year's final, is the No.
2-seeded player. The following seeded players, in order, are
Sebastien Grosjean of France, Andy Roddick, Gustavo Kuerten of
Brazil, Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands, Xavier Malisse of Belgium,
and Max Mirnyi of Belarus.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras considered taking a wild-card spot but eventually
declined. He parted ways with coach Jose Higueras after Wimbledon,
and there is speculation he may work with his former coach Paul
Annacone through the U.S. Open. Annacone could not be reached for
comment nor could Sampras, who was playing in a charity event in
Dallas Friday night.</TE>

<HD>Now It's a Tough Climb for All but Armstrong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PLATEAU DE BEILLE, France</DL>
<LD>Lance Armstrong was so far ahead and so relaxed after a grueling
final climb Friday that he even had time to zip up the bright yellow
jersey worn by the leader of the Tour de France.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth consecutive title now seems almost as easy to secure.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing the amazing run of mountain-stage victories he began
when he returned from cancer to take his first title in 1999,
Armstrong sprinted ahead of his rivals in the 12th stage and more
than doubled his overall race lead.</LD>
<TE>   But the Texan wasn't claiming victory yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't celebrate a victory before the final lap on the
Champs-Elysees," he said. "One bad day, and you can lose everything."</TE>
<TE>   Four more mountain stages, two of them exceptionally difficult,
still await riders.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was hard to see how anything, barring illness or injury,
could prevent Armstrong from keeping the yellow jersey all the way to
the July 28 finish in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   His rivals are far behind. Spain's Joseba Beloki, Armstrong's
biggest challenger, trailed by 2 minutes 28 seconds in the overall
standings after Friday's stage in the Pyrenees.</TE>
<TE>   As Armstrong pedaled through the last climb to the Plateau de
Beille, the U.S. Postal Service rider reached down to zip up his
yellow jersey, which had been open to below the chest for much of the
hot, sunny stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this climb very well. It's the nearest mountain pass to my
home," said Armstrong, who spends much of the year in Gerona, Spain.
He clocked 6 hours 29 seconds in the 123.69-mile stretch that began
in Lannemezan.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong has held the yellow jersey since Thursday, when he won
the Tour's opening mountain leg.</TE>
<TE>   That victory ended speculation, raised by his second-place showing
in Monday's time trial, that Armstrong was weaker this year. Friday's
victory confirmed that he's likely to take a fourth title.</TE>
<TE>   The record is five. Four riders--Jacques Anquetil and Bernard
Hinault of France, Eddy Merckx of Belgium, and Spain's Miguel
Indurain--have taken the title five times, and only Indurain won all
five consecutively.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong won his first title less than three years after being
diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his
lungs and brain. He was given a 40% chance of survival, and underwent
brain surgery and chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Already a world-class cyclist before he fell ill in 1996,
Armstrong blew his competitors away when he returned to the Tour in
1999 after making a full recovery, and repeated a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, four stage victories were enough to seal the title for
Armstrong, who established a whopping lead of 6:44 over his
archrival, Jan Ullrich. The German, who is absent from this year's
Tour because of injury, was so thoroughly dominated that he
acknowledged defeat with a week of racing to go.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Armstrong said he felt at his best level. There were
no weak moments, such as the one he experienced in the 2000 Tour when
he lost power in the last major mountain stage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet before the start of this year's race, the 30-year-old
Armstrong said he felt stronger than in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He will have another chance to prove it when the race heads to
Mont Ventoux in the southern Vaucluse region Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I regard it as the hardest climb this year," Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he could have won at Mont Ventoux, but pulled back
in the finishing stretch to let Marco Pantani win, calling the
decision a "gift" to the charismatic Italian. Pantani said he felt
insulted.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm in front, I won't make the same mistake again," Armstrong
said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The toughest stage of the Tour will probably be Wednesday's 16th
leg from Les Deux Alpes to La Plagne.</TE>

<TE>   Highlights from the 12th stage:</TE>
<TE>   Stage: A 123.69-mile stretch from Lannemezan to the Plateau de
Beille mountaintop in the Pyrenees.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Three-time defending champion Lance Armstrong, in 6 hours
29 seconds. He kept the overall leader's yellow jersey for a second
day.</TE>
<TE>   How others fared: Roberto Heras, Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service
teammate, finished second, 1:04 behind. Joseba Beloki was third, in
the same time as Heras, and was second overall, 2:28 behind
Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the day: "I don't celebrate any victory before the final
lap on the Champs-Elysees."-- Armstrong after moving closer to a
fourth consecutive title.</TE>
<TE>   Next stage: Today's 13th stage is a 106-mile mostly flat stretch
from Lavelanet at the foot of the Pyrenees to Beziers near the
Mediterranean coast.</TE>

<HD>Victory Over Comets Is a First for the Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All the Houston Comets needed was a victory over the Portland Fire--a
franchise that had never defeated the Comets--to move into a tie for
first place in the WNBA's Western Conference standings.</LD>
<LD>   Portland's Tamicha Jackson, with a career-high 21 points, and
Alisa Burras, with a season-high 19 points and 10 rebounds, made sure
it didn't happen Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Fire beat the Comets, 70-60, before 9,235 at the Rose Garden
in Portland, Ore., for its ninth victory in its last 10 games.</LD>
<TE>   Portland shot 52.8% from the field and built on 12 consecutive
points from Jackson in the second half to take a 54-50 lead.
Houston's Tina Thompson countered with a three-point shot to pull the
Comets (16-6) within one point, but Burras then made consecutive
field goals, and Portland (13-9) never relinquished the lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire is 1-7 all-time against the Comets, who fell to 1-3 on
their trip and slipped one game behind the Sparks in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson and Sheryl Swoopes each had 22 points for Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 89, Phoenix 48--The Storm's victory before 6,759 at
Seattle set a team record for winning margin and tagged the Mercury
(8-13) with a WNBA-record 17th consecutive road loss. Phoenix, which
has not won a road game since July 27, 2001, at Seattle, broke the
mark of 16 consecutive road losses set by Washington over the 1998
and 1999 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Jackson scored 18 of her 22 points in the first half for
the Storm (10-11). The Storm's 41-point victory margin bettered its
26-point margin over Sacramento last month.</TE>
<TE>   New York 70, Indiana 62--Becky Hammon scored 15 points on five
three-point shots as the Liberty (13-9) beat the Fever (8-13) before
6,771 at Indianapolis to close within two games of first-place
Washington in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Tamika Whitmore added 13 points and Vickie Johnson had 12 to help
New York extend its winning streak to three games. Tamika Catchings
led Indiana with 21 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 61, Minnesota 58--Sheri Sam had seven of her 11 points in
the second half as the Sol (10-11) tagged the Lynx (6-15) with their
seventh consecutive loss before 5,370 at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Smith led Minnesota with 12 points, but her chance to tie
the score with a three-point shot with two seconds left was an
airball.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 70, Sacramento 51--Kelly Miller scored 16 points and the
Sting (13-8) limited the Monarchs (4-16) to 29% field-goal shooting
in the victory before 7,246 at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was seven for eight from the field in 16 minutes for the
Sting, which extended its winning streak to four games. Yolanda
Griffith, in her fourth game back from an injury, had a season-high
16 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 84, Utah 73--Shannon Johnson had 21 points and matched her
career high with 12 assists as the Miracle (10-10) beat Starzz (14-7)
before 8,427 at Orlando, Fla., to end a four-game losing streak.
Margo Dydek had 18 points and eight rebounds for Utah.</TE>

<HD>Judge Bars Aides' Raise From Ballot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge ruled Friday that an initiative to raise the
salaries of home health aides is unconstitutional and should not
appear on the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling handed a huge victory to county supervisors, who
opposed the measure.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Dzintra Janavs said state law gives the supervisors, not the
voters, authority to set the workers' salaries.</LD>
<TE>   The aides receive $6.75 an hour to care for the elderly and infirm
at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's clearly invalid, on every basis," Janavs told
proponents of the initiative at the hearing. "I'm sympathetic to your
cause because I am myself at that age where I'm thinking about these
things, but...."</TE>
<TE>   Tyrone Freeman, head of the Service International Employees Union
Local 434B, said it will not appeal the decision but will lobby the
Legislature for a raise.</TE>
<TE>   The case was the county's second attempt to kill the initiative.
The first was in December, when the supervisors voted 4 to 1 in a
closed-door meeting to order their lawyer not to take the necessary
steps to put the measure on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Janavs ruled that vote illegal for a number of reasons. The county
then reversed its decision and proponents were allowed to gather
signatures for a ballot initiative.</TE>

<HD>State Is Set for Record Bond Issue</HD>
<DH>Financing: At $11.1 billion, sale is largest in U.S.
history. Cash could start coming in within weeks to fill budget hole
left by power purchases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>To fill the financial hole gouged by the electricity crisis of 2000
and 2001, California is at long last putting the final touches on an
$11.1-billion bond sale--the biggest one-time borrowing by a
government agency in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   If the bonds are sold as planned, the first infusion of cash could
reach California this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Within weeks, Wall Street rating agencies expect to grade the
riskiness of buying the bonds. Then, in the sort of road show the
state hasn't performed since 1997, the treasurer will visit cities
across the country to drum up investor interest.</LD>
<TE>   The money is intended to replace $6.5 billion that the state spent
buying electricity in the winter and spring of 2001 and to retire a
$4.3-billion loan also used to purchase power. Lawmakers wrestling
with the current $23.6-billion shortfall in the overdue 2002-03
budget have been counting on the bond sale. Without it, the state
would have to take out short-term loans to keep cash flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very unique situation," said Dan Aschenbach, senior
vice president for Moody's Investors Service, one of three major Wall
Street rating agencies. "I don't think there's any other type of bond
issue that's had to be put in place to resolve an issue as
significant as a $6-billion deficit to the state."</TE>
<TE>   The cost of retiring the new bonds is built into utility rates, so
the debt will be paid off dollar by dollar, month by month as
customers of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric get their bills over the next 20 years.
State officials say they do not expect to have to raise rates to
cover the cost of the bonds. But bond payments make those rates, now
among the highest in the country, less likely to be reduced anytime
soon.</TE>
<TE>   The bond sale is designed to spread the financial pain of an
extraordinary year of threatened blackouts and astronomical power
prices. State Treasurer Phil Angelides had sought to sell the bonds
14 months ago, but a deal was delayed by concerns over possible
lawsuits and a dispute between the California Public Utilities
Commission and Gov. Gray Davis' administration. The slowdown could
bring unintentional savings because interest rates have dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street rating agency analysts say they have grown more
confident in recent months that California officials have taken steps
to protect investors, such as reaching an agreement with utilities on
how to divvy the money they collect from ratepayers.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the things that have been a concern have been addressed
in various ways," said Claire Cohen, a vice chairman at Fitch, a Wall
Street rating agency.</TE>
<TE>   But the power bond sale is unusual not just for its size. It is
also exceptionally complex.</TE>
<TE>   The agency backing it--the California Department of Water
Resources--was thrust into the business of serving 27 million
electricity consumers practically overnight. To keep electricity
flowing to the customers of nearly bankrupt utilities, DWR spent
billions of general tax dollars in 2001, when the state enjoyed a
substantial budget surplus.</TE>
<TE>   DWR is expected to bow out of that business by the end of this
year and turn operations back to the utilities, long before the bonds
are repaid.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being a temporary utility, DWR is a hybrid utility. It is
governed by rules rushed through the Legislature in January 2001 as
the state veered toward collapse of its electrical system.</TE>
<TE>   DWR depends upon the California Public Utilities Commission to
adjust rates to cover its expenses. The two agencies are naturally at
odds. DWR, to guarantee bond buyers that they'll get their money
back, wants the PUC to adjust rates quickly, with no fuss, as DWR
sees necessary. But the PUC, charged with protecting ratepayers,
would prefer to first make certain DWR's costs are legitimate and
reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   Power Market Murky</TE>
<TE>   An uncertain electricity landscape lies in the backdrop. Prices of
wholesale power in California plummeted a year ago. But supplies got
dangerously low in a heat wave earlier this month. Many companies
have shelved their plans to build power plants, and federal
regulators have lifted price caps to a level that California
officials say could allow gouging. Another spike in prices could
crimp DWR's ability to cover its costs and force the agency to
request higher utility rates from the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   Rating agency analysts note, however, that today's power market is
vastly changed from a year and a half ago. At times 90% of the power
DWR needs to supply utility customers comes from contracts arranged
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not buying everything off the spot market any longer,"
said Aschenbach. "There's been a fair amount of new generation built,
which has helped the supply-demand balance and helped keep prices
moderate."</TE>
<TE>   "It takes the pressure off having to ask for additional revenue,"
he said. "Those types of factors argue for a more stable rating."</TE>
<TE>   DWR officials say they seek an "A" credit rating on the bonds,
which is not the highest and therefore an implicit acknowledgment of
some risk.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings given by Fitch, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's will
have a huge effect on how much California ratepayers will be charged
in interest on the bonds. Experts estimate, for example, that the
difference between an "A" and a "B" rating can amount to $1 billion
in interest paid over the life of the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   One risk factor the rating agencies analyze is whether utilities
or other outside parties can go to court to slow down or prevent the
PUC from adjusting rates as DWR dictates.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law that pushed DWR into the power-buying business, the
department must at least once a year submit its revenue requirement
to the PUC. The PUC is supposed to then adjust the amount of money
flowing from ratepayer bills to DWR to cover its costs.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E, driven into bankruptcy by exorbitant energy costs, sued last
year to force DWR to publicly explain and justify its costs. To
comply with a court ruling, DWR this summer established a 21-day
public hearing process under emergency regulations.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E and Edison argue that such a compressed window for public
comment violates state law, although they have not challenged it in
court. The possibility of a lawsuit lingers, though, and that could
discourage investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Fundamentally, a bond is only a promise to pay," said Joseph S.
Fichera, chief executive officer of Saber Partners, an investment
banking firm that helped the Davis administration handle energy
issues in 2001. "Investors will judge the credibility of the PUC and
DWR's promise, and if they demand huge amounts of cash to be
collected from ratepayers and set aside as collateral, it means
they're skeptical at the very least."</TE>
<TE>   Big Reserves Built In</TE>
<TE>   The treasurer's office and DWR have built fat reserves into the
bond deal. Billions of dollars will be sitting idle in DWR accounts
to help guarantee that the state can promptly repay investors.</TE>
<TE>   DWR proposes to have at least $1 billion in operating reserves and
$1.1 billion in bond-related reserves. The utilities claim that an
additional $1.5 billion in excess collections from ratepayers also
will be set aside to support the bond issue.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of keeping such reserves will be worth it, DWR officials
say, if it helps the state get a high investment grade rating and
thus a lower interest rate.</TE>
<TE>   Even with an "A" rating and interest rates between 5% and 6%, over
the next two decades, utility ratepayers will have to pay nearly as
much in interest on the bonds as the $11.1-billion in principal
borrowed.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said she expects a keen appetite for the power bonds on Wall
Street as investors look for a safer place than stocks to put their
money.</TE>
<TE>   "California is a big name," said Cohen.</TE>

<HD>Dozens to Compete for LAPD Leadership</HD>
<DH>Chief: Forty-seven meet deadline to apply. A committee is
named to advise on hiring process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the filing deadline closed Friday for LAPD chief applicants, city
officials said 47 people had declared their interest in the job, and
the Los Angeles Police Commission appointed a panel of local
residents to help develop the criteria for selecting the department's
next leader.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-member committee, a culturally and ethnically diverse group
of community members, will sift through the thousands of suggestions
from the public regarding how the next chief should be chosen,
according to police commissioners who will oversee the process.</LD>
<LD>   The commission would not release the names of those who have
applied for the post, but some of the leading contenders have made
their candidacies public. They include a number of candidates from
within the LAPD, as well as some outsiders and some who used to work
for the department and are seeking to return as chief.</LD>
<TE>   Among the most prominent candidates from outside the LAPD who are
applying for the position are: Portland Police Chief Mark Kroeker, a
former LAPD assistant chief; Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, who also
served with the LAPD; and former New York Police Commissioner William
Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Assistant Chief David J. Gascon, who served as chief of staff
to former Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, submitted his application
Friday. LAPD Deputy Chiefs David Kalish and Margaret York also have
applied for the post. Other LAPD applicants include commanders George
Gascon, Betty Kelepecz and Jim McDonnell.</TE>
<TE>   Sifting through those applications begins next week as the Police
Commission will convene the community panel to begin what officials
say they hope will be a quick review, resulting in a new chief as
early as September.</TE>
<TE>   "These community members will give us an additional perspective,
and the more information in a process like this, the better," said
Police Commission President Rick Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will begin interviewing finalists in the third week
of August, after which it will send a list of the top three
candidates to Mayor James K. Hahn, who will make the final decision.
Hahn, who has said he wants the next chief to cooperate with the
department's civilian overseers, has the option of choosing one of
those three candidates or of asking the commission to supply him with
more names.</TE>
<TE>   The panel began looking for a new police chief after voting 4-1 in
April to deny Parks' request for a second five-year term. Parks
stepped down shortly after the commission vote, prompting the city to
appoint retired Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy as head of the department
until a permanent replacement could be found.</TE>
<TE>   The job announcement describes the ideal candidate as someone with
"considerable experience working with diverse communities" and in
"inspiring and motivating" officers.</TE>
<TE>   The committee members are:</TE>
<TE>   William Allen, founder of the Economic Alliance of the San
Fernando Valley; Albert DeBlanc, a former LAPD sergeant and currently
a member of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission; Miguel
Contreras, head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor; Rabbi
Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Simon Wiesenthal Center; and
Jeff Donfeld, an attorney and founding member of Chabad of Pacific
Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Patricia Glaser, an attorney and community activist; Antonio
Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Registration and Education
Project; Howard Halm, an attorney and former president of the Asian
Pacific American Bar Assn.; Lorri Jean, executive director of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force; and Ann Reiss Lane, a former
member of the Police Commission and currently chair of Women Against
Gun Violence.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Ann I. Park, an attorney and president of the Korean
American Bar Assn.; Page Miller, a community activist; Connie Rice, a
civil rights attorney and head of the Advancement Project; Luis
Rodriguez, a public defender and former president of the Mexican
American Bar Assn.; and Bishop Kenneth Ulmer, senior pastor at
Faithful Central Bible Church.</TE>

<HD>Old Technology Offers New Way to Fight Crop Pest</HD>
<DH>Citrus: A packinghouse assembly line that used to wash
fruit now helps wash glassy-winged sharpshooters from shipments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rattling and rumbling the way it does, the conveyor-belt contraption
hardly seems a model of innovation.</LD>
<LD>   But the old packinghouse assembly line, once used to wash fruit
but set up in Fillmore to purge produce of the dreaded glassy-winged
sharpshooter, is among the newest weapons in the war against the
crop-ravaging insect.</LD>
<LD>   A year and a half into a statewide campaign to ensure that citrus
shipments are sharpshooter-free, agricultural officials are looking
for new ways to rid loads of the voracious pest, which has wreaked
havoc on California's wine industry and could be damaging other crops
as well.</LD>
<TE>   Current methods, such as spraying water on the fruit prior to
shipment, do not always get the bugs out, growers and packers say.</TE>
<TE>   A subcommittee of the state's glassy-winged sharpshooter task
force met this week in Bakersfield to discuss more effective tactics,
reviewing everything from high-pressure washes to pesticide
treatments prior to harvest.</TE>
<TE>   The assembly line system, which has been used for about a year by
a handful of Ventura County citrus growers, is expected to be high on
the list of recommended remedies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not much to look at, but it sure works," said Mike Mobley,
who owns a Santa Paula-based ranch management company that operates
the machinery on behalf of the Bee Sweet packinghouse near Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Nine Ventura County citrus growers who ship to that packinghouse
first run their produce through the scrub line, which uses rollers
and brushes to wipe the fruit clean.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to come up with a better way to eliminate the sharpshooter
from our shipments," Mobley said. "We were able to take this
equipment, which had been sitting around collecting rust, and turn it
into an effective tool."</TE>
<TE>   With sharpshooter infestations reported from San Diego to the San
Joaquin Valley, state and federal officials are devoting $20 million
a year to curbing the spread of the needle-nosed insect.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 research projects are underway across California to
battle the bug, an exotic pest discovered in the state in the late
1980s after being accidentally brought in from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other pests that feed on fruit, the sharpshooter does its
damage by delivering a bacterium that causes Pierce's disease, which
clogs water-carrying vessels in plants and starves them of nutrients
until they wither and die. Vineyards are particularly susceptible,
although the disease also strikes almond trees, oleanders and other
plants.</TE>
<TE>   Though the disease has plagued agricultural areas for more than a
century, the arrival of the aggressive, fast-moving sharpshooter has
fueled its spread.</TE>
<TE>   The worst damage has occurred in Temecula, where 1,000 acres of
wine grapes have been destroyed in recent years, costing growers $40
million.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the ongoing effort to prevent the pest from moving into
other winemaking regions, state regulators have invoked a range of
restrictions on shipments of nursery stock and other agricultural
products.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, for example, local inspectors must examine
every leaf of every nursery plant--except cut flowers--for
sharpshooter eggs before they leave the county. Citrus products also
must meet certain conditions to prevent sharpshooters from being
carried to areas free of infestation.</TE>
<TE>   But Jay Van Rein, spokesman for the California Department of Food
and Agriculture, said some packinghouses have continued to receive
shipments with sharpshooters on board, prompting the search for
better ways of keeping the bugs at bay.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural officials are scheduled to report their findings at
an Aug. 14 subcommittee meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the methods we have in place haven't proven as effective
as we would like," Van Rein said. "Our goal is to make sure that
[growers] are not artificially transporting this thing around the
state."</TE>
<TE>   That effort is especially significant in Ventura County, where
citrus groves swarm with sharpshooters at certain times of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The yellow-eyed insect does not have the same deadly effect on
citrus trees that it has on vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   Still, agricultural researchers recently launched a study to
determine whether there are links between the thick sharpshooter
populations in Ventura County and a host of emerging problems
affecting fruit and trees.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Agricultural Commissioner Alan Laird said the high pest
populations also have made it hard for growers to rid shipments of
sharpshooters. He said packinghouse managers simply reject loads when
the bug is discovered, sending them back to Ventura County and
costing growers time and money.</TE>
<TE>   That is how the Bee Sweet packinghouse came to set up the old wash
line in a Fillmore equipment yard.</TE>
<TE>   The packer, which pulls fruit from about 400 acres in Ventura
County, continued to receive shipments peppered with sharpshooters,
despite the fact that growers were following rules for removing the
bugs.</TE>
<TE>   The assembly line has eliminated the problem, with Mobley and a
crew of workers able to clean as many as seven truckloads a day.</TE>
<TE>   "They will reject a load if they find just one [sharpshooter], so
if you can't eliminate all of the sharpshooters, it's a total waste

the entire operation.</TE>

<HD>Sugar, Then Add Magic</HD>
<DH>Confections: Big Sky Concessions brings cotton candy, the
quintessential fair food, to Costa Mesa. It's made on-site and served
on a paper cone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the scent of melting caramel and butter mingling in the air,
Brit Barnes stood over a vat, wrapping web upon web of a bubblegum
flavored confection onto a cone.</LD>
<LD>   Within five minutes, the veteran confectioner had twirled and hung
six bags of pink, blue and purple cotton candy from the ceiling of
the family's narrow trailer, tucked into the food court of the Orange
County Fairgrounds.</LD>
<LD>   "Timing is important and it can be a mess," Barnes, 20, said as he
wiped sticky threads of spun sweetness from his hands and apron. "I'm
covered in sugar all day long."</LD>
<TE>   Barnes, who has been making the quintessential fair food each
summer since he was 5, is part of a 30-year family tradition of
selling treats such as candy apples, popcorn and snow cones at county
fairs. The Barnes' Big Sky Concessions has three colorfully designed
20-foot trailers parked at this year's fair in Costa Mesa, which runs
through July 28. They'll travel to at least three more county fairs
before summer's end.</TE>
<TE>   These days, most cotton candy purveyors sell pre-made products
sealed in plastic bags. The Barnes family prefers to whip it up
on-site and serve it on a white paper cone--which fascinates
fairgoers young and old.</TE>
<TE>   "Little kids come up to us with their parents and say, 'Mom, how
does that happen?' " said Barnes' mother, Judy. "We just tell them
it's magic."</TE>
<TE>   Magic or not, the art of cotton candy making still requires a
little help from science.</TE>
<TE>   A mixture of sugar and powdered food coloring called flossine is
poured into a centrifuge. As an electric current melts the sugar, the
center chamber slings it into tiny holes in the machine's circular
vat, where it eventually turns into the thread-like froth.</TE>
<TE>   The candy concoction, first called Fairy Floss, was introduced to
the public at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, where it sold for
pennies.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Satariano of Long Beach asked for cotton candy on a stick
for her 4-year-old son, Jack. "I just think it's more fun on a
stick," Satariano said as she handed a puffy pink cloud of sugar to
her son.</TE>
<TE>   "I like cotton candy the best," said Jack, his smile wide as he
swiped sugar from his face. "It tastes good."</TE>
<TE>   Others prefer the bagged version of the treat, saving some for
later as they stroll through the rides and games at the fair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good," said 10-year-old Leah Heit as she popped a handful of
blueberry-flavored cotton candy into her mouth. "I like the way it
dissolves in your mouth. It's great fair food."</TE>
<TE>   For the Barnes family, cotton candy and the other fair treats
represent more than just good summer business. Over the years, they
have built relationships with Orange County Fair vendors and their
families who travel the same summer circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched our kids work and grow up together," said Judy Barnes,
49, a high school English teacher in Billings, Mont. "It has taught
our kids responsibility and how to maintain a strong work ethic."</TE>

<HD>June Home Prices Set Record as Sales Dip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's blistering housing market finally cooled a bit in
June as sales dipped, but the price of a typical house rose sharply
to another record--$335,000.</LD>
<LD>   "The sales pace is still incredibly strong and stable," said
analyst John Karevoll of DataQuick Information Systems. "Supply is
the issue. There just aren't enough houses on the market right now."</LD>
<LD>   Sales of houses and condos totaled 1,558 last month, down 103 from
the month before and 172 from the previous June--but they still
represented the third-strongest performance for June in 13 years.</LD>
<TE>   Sales were also off year-to-year in the rest of Southern
California, because last June was such a spectacular month, Karevoll
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after last month's $13,000 increase from May, Ventura
County's median home price--at which half of sales cost more and half
less--was up $58,000 from June 2001 and $142,000 higher than in 1995,
at the bottom of the real estate market.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no indication of weakening," Karevoll said. "As shaky as
the rest of the economy is, especially the stock market, real estate
is looking very good to a lot of people. Buyers want in."</TE>
<TE>   But for the first time in months, buyers began to balk at
ever-escalating prices, real estate agents said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm seeing houses stay on the market a little longer," said Karen
Campbell, president of the Ventura County Coastal Assn. of Realtors,
which represents agents in six west county cities.</TE>
<TE>   "People are pricing their homes a little high," she said. "They're
taking the latest [comparable sale] and pricing their homes $20,000
or $30,000 higher. Sometimes they do sell, but more are staying on
the market longer."</TE>
<TE>   For example, buyer hesitation pushed the number of homes available
in the west county from 490 two months ago to 586 today, Campbell
said. As the inventory builds, true competition will return and
prices will stabilize, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But there are still a lot of buyers out there," she said. "And we
still have a very short supply."</TE>
<TE>   The market remains strong in both the east county and the west.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers in Newbury Park and west Thousand Oaks saw the sales price
of a typical house increase $114,000 to $434,000 in 12 months. Simi
Valley and Oak Park registered sales increases, although closed
escrows were off 9.9% countywide.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by buyers from Santa Barbara, the prices of homes in
midtown Ventura continued their run-up--increasing from $239,000 to
$318,500 in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore, once the county's most affordable city, saw a 48% sales
increase that helped boost the median price of a house $64,000 to
$278,000. In central and coastal Oxnard, prices were up 31%, to
$345,000.</TE>
<TE>   So far, this year has been the best for home sales in recent
history, surpassing even 1988, the premier year of the 1980s boom.</TE>
<TE>   For the first six months of 2002, sales were up nearly 13.1% from
2001, which was also a very good year. And prices were up $46,000 on
a typical house, according to DataQuick, which counts sales when
escrows close.</TE>
<TE>   Agents say they see more of the same for at least a few months,
since the continued decline of interest rates for mortgages will only
fuel the boom. Fixed home loan rates reached a 30-year low last week.
Rates for a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage were about 6 1/2% a few
months ago, but are now only 6%.</TE>
<TE>   "When the rates went down last week, we saw an influx of buyers,"
Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   But Karevoll said that Ventura County's 21% price hikes from last
June to this June are not sustainable gains.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think prices are going to go down," he said. "But these
increases will play themselves out. The high prices will bring more
properties onto the market, and that's when the prices will start to
ease off."</TE>

<HD>Both Sides in Beating Case Tout 2nd Tape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A grainy surveillance tape depicting a scuffle in the moments before
Inglewood police struck a handcuffed 16-year-old was described Friday
night by attorneys on both sides as supporting their version of
events.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for two Inglewood police officers who were indicted this
week in connection with the July 6 incident, also partially captured
on a bystander's videotape, say the second tape broadcast Friday on
television helps exonerate their clients by showing they were trying
mightily to restrain a violent Donovan Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   "What it shows is that Donovan was involved in a violent struggle
with two or three police officers before he was handcuffed," said
John Barnett, attorney for Inglewood Police Officer Jeremy J. Morse,
who is charged with assault under color of authority.</LD>
<TE>   Milton Grimes, attorney for Donovan's father, Coby Chavis,
disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be glad to have a jury interpret this," he said. "That video
does not exonerate these officers. That video incriminates them 100%
.... The kid is being beaten on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Morse was videotaped on July 6 slamming Jackson onto the trunk of
a patrol car and punching him in the face. The incident occurred at
an Inglewood gas station where sheriff's deputies were citing Chavis
for driving with a suspended license and expired registration tags.</TE>
<TE>   That tape has been played repeatedly on national television. The
second tape was taken by a surveillance camera trained on the gas
pumps at the service station and shows figures that are difficult to
identify moving in and out of view before Jackson was handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Morse and Officer Bijan Darvish were indicted  by a grand jury
Wednesday and pleaded not guilty Thursday. Darvish is charged with
filing a false police report. They are each free on $25,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish has been placed on paid administrative leave following his
indictment, authorities said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Morse was placed on paid administrative leave after the videotape
was aired on television and caused controversy nationwide. Both of
the officers will remain on leave "pending the final outcome of the
investigation," said Inglewood Police Chief Ronald C. Banks.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish's attorney, Ronald G. Brower, said he thinks the second
tape "is helpful to the police officers.... It sets in perspective
what you see on the citizen's video."</TE>
<TE>   The tape, he said, "confirms material that Officer Darvish put in
his report, suggesting he wrote a truthful report."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons
said, "We're not going to comment on the evidence in this case
outside the courtroom."</TE>
<TE>   Both officers are scheduled to appear at an Inglewood courthouse
Aug. 13 for pretrial motions and to set a trial date.</TE>

<LD>Six grim-faced deputies marched into Los Angeles County Fire
Department headquarters on the morning of Feb. 14. Busy working the
phone in his cubicle, a public information officer named Roland
Sprewell hardly noticed them pass.</LD>
<LD>   A few minutes later, Sprewell's boss approached, ashen-faced, and
summoned him to a conference room. The deputies were waiting. One
held a felony arrest warrant bearing the names of Sprewell and his
wife:</LD>
<LD>   On or about July 26, 2001 ... Roland Lee Sprewell and Heidi
Pauline Sprewell ... did willfully, unlawfully and maliciously set
fire to and burn a structure ... at 1541 N. Raymond Ave. in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   Sprewell, a firefighter for 18 of his 37 years, was intimate with
fire's capacity to destroy. He was about to learn even more. The way
authorities were telling it, the same man who had fielded media
inquiries as a county Fire Department spokesman had torched a house
after his attempt to purchase it had fallen through.</TE>
<TE>   A judge dismissed the prosecution's circumstantial case last month
before it ever got to trial. But the dismissal is small consolation
to Sprewell. The district attorney has threatened to refile the case,
leaving Sprewell's reputation, career and freedom in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   "He's no longer Roland Sprewell, public information officer. Now
he's Roland Sprewell, the alleged arsonist," lamented a friend, Brent
Burton, a county Fire Department captain.</TE>
<TE>   The story began at 11:45 a.m. last July 26 with a phoned-in report
to the Pasadena Fire Department of a fire at Raymond Avenue and
Howard Street.</TE>
<TE>   Responding fire crews quickly extinguished a second-floor blaze in
a rambling Victorian house. There was no gas or power service in the
vacant, unfurnished house, and the fire appeared to have started in
the middle of a staircase.</TE>
<TE>   It looked suspicious, but Ray Gordon, the Pasadena Fire Department
battalion chief in charge at the scene, had a 1:30 p.m. meeting to
attend in East L.A., so he handed control of the scene to Capt. Harry
Crusberg and left.</TE>
<TE>   An hour into his meeting, Gordon said, he got a call from Crusberg
asking him to return to the scene. Roland Sprewell had shown up, not
as a fireman, but as a citizen offering information about his
eight-month-long attempt to buy the house.</TE>
<TE>   The house, built in 1916, was owned by a nonprofit housing and
neighborhood rehabilitation program, Pasadena Neighborhood Housing
Services. The agency had bought the property in 1991, but had put it
on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The Sprewells had sold their home in the Inland Empire community
of Alta Loma in 1999 and decided to buy in Pasadena, where Heidi had
been raised and where Roland had worked for the Fire Department for
seven years. He and Heidi, both African Americans, wanted their three
children to live somewhere where their race was less likely to invite
taunts at school.</TE>
<TE>   The family moved in with relatives in Altadena, and Sprewell
looked around Pasadena and Altadena for distressed properties,
fixer-uppers; he'd been raised in an Irvine housing tract and wanted
"something with character."</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000, he found the five-bedroom, five-bathroom charmer in
northwest Pasadena, the same district he'd worked as a Pasadena
firefighter. The area had seen better days but looked to be making a
comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell took Heidi to show her the wood floors, the sweeping
porch. They fell in love with the home and settled with the housing
agency on a $340,000 sale price with $9,900 down.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sprewells had trouble getting a loan big enough to cover
the balance, according to court records. The escrow was extended, but
the deal hit another snag--an undisclosed IRS tax lien against the
property that blocked completion of the sale.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2001, a frustrated Sprewell asked for a termination of the
escrow and a return of his deposit. The housing agency agreed to
cancel the escrow but refused to refund the deposit.</TE>
<TE>   The house had stood vacant for nearly six months when the parties
met in mid-July last year to try to resolve the problems. At that
meeting, Sprewell proposed renting or leasing the property until the
sale could be completed. Then he said something that prosecutors
would later seize on as evidence of his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them that, based on my experience as a firefighter in that
area, vacant homes were a fire risk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The housing service's executive director declined Sprewell's offer
to rent the property, and the parties agreed to meet again July 26.
In the hours before that meeting, much of 1541 N. Raymond would be
gutted by fire.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, Sprewell showed up at the scene sometime after
Gordon had left and started talking, disclosing facts that
prosecutors would characterize as suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   "He advised us that he was in escrow ... he was having some
problems with the escrow and he was about to lose some [deposit]
money," Crusberg testified at the preliminary hearing. His financial
interest in the transaction meant "early on that Sprewell needed to
be ruled out" as a suspect, Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Sprewell had previously worked for the Pasadena
department, the investigation was put under the control of Bob
Reinhardt, an arson investigator in the Burbank Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt made an initial determination that the fire had been
started intentionally, then turned the investigation over to the San
Gabriel Valley Arson and Explosives Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   The task force's last interview with Sprewell was Aug. 27.
According to court records, he recounted his activities on the day of
the fire: returning from a trip to Yosemite, seeing a column of smoke
in the area of the house while driving his truck to show a
prospective buyer, showing up at the housing agency and learning
about the fire, driving to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   But the task force wanted more--it asked to interview Heidi and
asked the couple to submit to polygraph tests.</TE>
<TE>   Only then, Sprewell said, did he realize that investigators
weren't just gathering information from him. He was a suspect. He
told his boss and said he was advised to retain a lawyer, who advised
Sprewell against making any further statements.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, the task force called to ask for another
interview, and again the attorney advised against it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's when they got upset," Sprewell said.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 14, one day before he was to take the final portion of the
examination for promotion to captain, Sprewell was arrested on a
single charge of arson.</TE>
<TE>   Stray details are all he remembers of the day: Being led out of
his office in handcuffs, past colleagues too embarrassed to look him
in the eye. The unnerving advice he got before being locked in a
holding cell with other prisoners--ditch the Fire Department shirt.
The jailhouse professional courtesies slipped to him by a sympathetic
guard--extra bologna sandwiches and cartons of juice.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day he was transferred to the Twin Towers jail in
downtown Los Angeles, issued jail scrubs and waist chains, and placed
in a high-security ward.</TE>
<TE>   "I was locked on a bench between two guys discussing the murders
they had committed," he said. "I thought I would never see my family
again."</TE>
<TE>   His wife got a call at work: Roland had been picked up and police
were looking for her too. She spent the rest of the day making phone
calls, asking an aunt to pick the children up from school, arranging
Roland's bail.</TE>
<TE>   She turned herself in the next morning and bailed out almost
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband's arrest made national news and led most local
broadcasts. Some commentators compared Sprewell with John Leonard
Orr, a former Glendale arson investigator now serving a life sentence
for setting fires that killed four people and damaged or destroyed 67
homes.</TE>
<TE>   When Heidi Sprewell returned home with the children, she had one
request for visitors who wanted to know if the family needed
anything: Bring videos "so the kids wouldn't have to see what was on
TV."</TE>
<TE>   Within a few weeks of the arrests, the housing service changed its
mind and returned Sprewell's deposit. In April, prosecutors would
dismiss the arson charge against Heidi Sprewell, in what a
spokesperson called "the interest of justice."</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, at the preliminary hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Robert Foltz laid out the prosecution's case against Roland Sprewell.
His inability to close the sale of 1541 N. Raymond, Foltz said, had
put Sprewell "between a rock and a hard place." He had "no way of
getting out of this deal without losing his money," Foltz said.</TE>
<TE>   "So he has a strong motive to do it." Foltz did not explain how
Sprewell might have expected burning down the house would lead to a
refund of his deposit.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz said Sprewell's warning statements about the house being a
fire risk had been self-serving. And the prosecutor said it could
hardly be a coincidence that, on the day of the fire, Sprewell "just
happens to be in Pasadena and he just happens to show up at the
fire."</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell's attorney, Vicki Podberesky, attacked Foltz's version of
events. The house had a history of vandalism, Podberesky said. About
a week before the fire, the housing agency had sent someone to board
up a crawl space and a second-floor balcony door.</TE>
<TE>   Podberesky noted that firefighters had found the back door to the
burning house open. There had been no sign of forced entry, she said,
and Sprewell had no key to the property. Podberesky also said during
the preliminary hearing that the defense had interviewed two
witnesses who had seen suspicious characters near the house on the
day of the fire.</TE>
<TE>   One of those witnesses, who spoke to The Times on the condition of
anonymity, said that, shortly before the fire, she had seen a group
of teenagers approaching from the direction of the house. Two of them
were passing what looked like a burning piece of rolled up newspaper
back and forth, the woman said. "Ten to 15 minutes later, the house
was on fire," the woman said.</TE>
<TE>   After evaluating the evidence, Superior Court Judge Teri Schwartz
said it was insufficient to warrant a trial. "The statements
[Sprewell] made are consistent with innocence, and so is everything
else that the prosecution has presented in this case," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors rarely lose at this stage of a criminal case, experts
say. To move a case from preliminary hearing to trial, they must
convince a judge only that there is probable cause to believe the
defendant guilty. That is a much lower threshold than the standard of
"beyond a reasonable doubt," which is necessary to convict a
defendant at trial.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't meet probable cause, which is really a minimal
showing, it may have been an abuse of discretion to file in the first
place," said Gerald Uelmen, a former federal prosecutor who now
teaches criminal procedure and evidence courses at Santa Clara
University School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz initially said that he intended to refile the case; now the
district attorney's office will not talk about it, except to say that
the case will be reviewed before a decision is made on whether to
refile charges.</TE>
<TE>   After four months of paid administrative leave, Sprewell has
returned to work, but in a less public role: Although he is still a
public information officer, he does not do television interviews as a
department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   He still has a job he loves and says he still respects law
enforcement, but Roland Sprewell is a changed man.</TE>
<TE>   His personal possessions now include a thick stack of receipts,
collected almost compulsively from his visits to gas stations,
restaurants, the corner store. He says the flimsy slips of paper are
his insurance in case he needs to prove his whereabouts on a given
day at a given hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a better understanding of how people get caught up in the
criminal justice system," he said recently. "You're not innocent
until proven guilty. You're there, and God help you."</TE>

<HD>Budget Problems and Complex Rules Reduce Lunches for Poor
Children</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last summer, Covina Park bustled with the energy of children eating
free lunches, courtesy of a federal program designed to provide
low-income youngsters with nutritious meals during vacation.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the park is quiet, the food program dropped by the city
of Covina because of a budget crunch and doubt that federal
reimbursements would cover the costs.</LD>
<LD>   In Compton, where children received free summer lunches last year,
alternatives are being sought after several community groups chose
not to sponsor the lunches anymore because of complex rules and
onerous paperwork.</LD>
<TE>   The Covina and Compton cases are not isolated. Nationally and in
California, the summer nutrition program is struggling, plagued by a
loss of sponsors and inability to meet the needs of millions of
eligible children. The program is the largest federal effort to feed
low-income children during the summer--the same children who depend
on free breakfasts and lunches at school to promote their health,
development and school readiness.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the number of sponsors for the summer programs in
California declined 6%, according to recent studies. That was part of
a national trend in which 47,000 fewer children--a decline of 2.3%
from the year before--received the summer meals.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates said the trend appears to be continuing this year. In
addition to the loss of sponsors they blame the public's spotty
awareness of the meals.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Sharpe, regional director of California Food Policy
Advocates, a group that works to ease hunger, recalled his efforts to
enlist six Los Angeles-area churches to sponsor new feeding sites
this year. All declined.</TE>
<TE>   "Some said it was too much government hassle, too much paperwork,"
he said. "Some said they hadn't realized how many children they would
have to feed to break even."</TE>
<TE>   Some counties in California lost more ground last year than
others, according to a recent survey by Food Policy Advocates. In
Ventura County, the number of sites serving free lunches dropped to
three in 2001 from 20 in 2000. The number of sites in Los Angeles
serving food declined to 616 from 656. Orange County managed to
maintain most of its centers, even though some sponsors dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   "For kids on summer recess in these areas, not having access to
the summer lunch program puts their families in a difficult
position," said Michael Flood, executive director of the Los Angeles
Regional Food Bank, which helps on outreach for the program. "For
many, the only other option is charitable food from a pantry."</TE>
<TE>   Beginnings in 1968</TE>
<TE>   Congress initiated the summer lunches as a pilot program in 1968
and extended it nationwide in 1975. School districts, nonprofits,
universities, and city, county and Indian tribal governments can be
sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Many sites also provide recreational and educational activities.
The sponsors can prepare their own meals or contract food preparation
out and be reimbursed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates say the department's guidelines--some of them meant
to prevent fraud--pose barriers for sponsors. In addition, Congress,
in overhauling welfare laws, cut reimbursement rates and eliminated
some start-up funds.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Covina dropped its one summer meal site this year
after anticipating that it would not be able to pay $4,000 for
staffing, said the recreation services supervisor, Carren Chaney. For
example, sponsors have to make sure that parents don't eat the food.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was a very positive experience," said Chaney of the
5,200 lunches served in 10 weeks. "We hope to reinstate the program
for next fiscal year. Unfortunately, this year, with budget cuts
looming, we just couldn't include it in our planning."</TE>
<TE>   Keith Rodgers, who helps to direct a city-run day camp at
Compton's Gonzales Park, said the summer lunch program attracted many
families. But after it was dropped by its church sponsor a year ago,
some families now go to charitable food giveaways once or twice a
month.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good program for the community, but they need to smooth
out the regulations," Rodgers added.</TE>
<TE>   At East Los Angeles' Casa Maravilla recently, about 120 children
gobbled box lunches of pizza, burritos, fruit, milk and cookies. Rudy
Rodriguez, manager at the site--one of 14 sponsored by East Los
Angeles College--said the numbers of kids getting free lunches
increase toward the end of the month as family food budgets dwindle.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said he understands the needs of such families. He
participated in the summer lunch program as a youngster 20 years ago
in the same neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "It got tough for my mom with six kids to feed," said Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Leonarda Garcia, who was at Casa Maravilla with five of her
children, ranging in age from 4 to 13, said most of her friends
depend on the free summer lunches to save money and provide their
children with something other than junk food.</TE>
<TE>   "I buy two gallons of milk a day and can barely keep up," said
Garcia, whose husband drives a truck. "Many parents are working, yet
they still cannot feed their children. We need this program."</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles' Parks and Recreation Department operates
100 summer lunch sites. According to manager Vicki Israel, about 25%
of the $1.6 million spent on the program last year--mostly for
staffing--was picked up by city taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is if the mayor and City Council did not support the
program, we'd have to reduce or cancel it," said Israel. "Maybe the
USDA needs to provide more money per meal. The funding we get has
remained constant, but the cost of caterers, transportation, gasoline
all keeps going up."</TE>
<TE>   Israel noted that one caterer had run out of 100% fruit juice
drinks and had to deliver 80% juice instead. Because of strict rules,
the city was not reimbursed for the juice, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The growth of year-round schools in Los Angeles and other cities
has complicated matters. While more youngsters are in school during
summer and get free lunches there, most of those school-based
programs will not serve neighborhood children on vacation. Los
Angeles officials have set up 34 sites to serve lunches year-round,
but Israel said twice as many are needed to meet the needs of
eligible youngsters off the school track.</TE>
<TE>   State Compares Well</TE>
<TE>   In California last year, 37% of the 1.8 million children who
received free school lunches participated in the summer program,
according to the state Department of Education. California's rate is
better than most states', ranking among the top three, according to a
national survey by the Food Research and Action Center. But advocates
say there is still a great unmet need.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and advocates are looking at ways to keep the program
going and increase participation. In California this year, the USDA
made it easier for school districts serving school-time lunches to
provide summer lunches as well. U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana)
last month also introduced legislation to expand a pilot project that
eases paperwork and provides the maximum reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make it easier for groups to sponsor this program and
we need to do a better job of outreach so people know it's
available," said Rep. Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte), who as a member of
the House Workforce and Education Committee will consider whether to
reauthorize the summer lunch program and other child nutrition
programs next year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Groundwater Replenishment System, which will turn sewage into
drinking water, received a $30-million grant from the state
Department of Water Resources earlier this week.</LD>
<LD>   The project, a joint effort by the Orange County Water District
and the Orange County Sanitation District, will take highly treated
sewage and purify it. The result, similar in quality to bottled
water, will be pumped to spreading basins in Anaheim, where it will
percolate into deep aquifers and blend with the ground water.</LD>
<LD>   The grant, funded from a water bond passed two years ago, will be
used to build advanced water treatment facilities, pumping stations
and the 13-mile pipeline from the treatment facilities to existing
spreading basins. This funding brings the total grant money for the
project to $92.5 million.</LD>

<LD>   Investigators were not immediately able to determine how much
money was stolen in the noontime robbery, Sgt. Gary Meza said. Meza

<HD>Not Everyone Gets Into Deep Creek's Pools</HD>
<DH>High desert hideaway isn't easy to get to, and some popular
pastimes aren't even legal, but the soaking and sunbathing make it a
real hot spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMMETT BERG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You pay your money or you take your chances.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Castro takes your money for the privilege of crossing his
property outside his weathered cabin in the furrowed high desert
several miles southeast of Hesperia. Castro's property, an old ranch,
lies athwart a trail to the popular Deep Creek hot springs at the
bottom of a narrow canyon along the northern boundary of the San
Bernardino National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   You can also walk a long five miles to the hot springs on the
Pacific Crest Trail, but Castro's property offers the easiest access,
along with a secure place to park--for a fee.</LD>
<TE>   If you try to cross his land without paying the $4-per-person
toll, chances are Castro will catch up with you somewhere out on the
crinkled outback he prowls on his dirt bike, armed with a pistol, on
the lookout for scofflaws.</TE>
<TE>   The toll paid, you head on foot down a steep ravine to Deep Creek
and its cluster of hot pools. You follow a trail blazed by Serrano
Indians and later widened by homesteaders, fishermen, squatters,
naturalists, biologists and, more recently, by urban escapists.</TE>
<TE>   The short hike ends at a bluff above a U-turn on Deep Creek, a
ribbon of water that feeds the Mojave River. The pools are just a
short slide down the bluff and a hop across wet rocks. Below unfolds
a scene of mostly unadorned sunbathers sprawled lizard-like next to
the water.</TE>
<TE>   This is government land, but rarely is there a uniform or badge in
sight. Officials of the U.S. Forest Service and the federal Bureau of
Land Management, who share jurisdiction over the region, say they
lack the resources to station a ranger at Deep Creek, let alone
maintain the springs or build and operate a campground.</TE>
<TE>   The only full-time enforcement is carried out by Castro. He has no
authority beyond his property. But he maintains a semblance of order,
picking up trash, tracking down lost hikers and notifying authorities
when creek-side conduct threatens to get out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   Benign Anarchy</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, an air of benign anarchy prevails. Flouting a
government rule against camping, people put up tents, which sprout
colorfully from the stream bank's rocky recesses. Naked bodies come
and go languidly from the hot pools. Drug use is rumored, but doesn't
appear flagrant.</TE>
<TE>   On one recent afternoon, soakers jeered, and one displayed his
backside, as a county sheriff's helicopter circled several times
overhead. The sheriff is empowered to enforce state laws on federal
land.</TE>
<TE>   People have been coming here to take the waters for at least 30
years, ever since some amateur landscape engineers, using sandbags
and a bit of masonry, created the pools. Castro estimates that at
least 1,000 people a year come to relax in the pools, which blend
diverted creek water with 108-degree seepage from the hot springs.
There are several pools of varying temperatures. Small waterfalls
connect three of them.</TE>
<TE>   The full treatment involves a soak in each, topped off by a dip in
the cold creek water or in the ultra-hot "crab cooker" pool. With the
pools deeper than a tall person in some places, the challenge is to
perch yourself comfortably on a submerged rock and let your cares
melt away.</TE>
<TE>   Most who visit come and go during daylight hours. Many wear
swimsuits. Modesty is not the only reason. Who knows what kind of
person might be drawn here by the prospect of lax oversight and
nudity. Deep Creek was once a wild place, and the aura of an outlaw
oasis still clings to it.</TE>
<TE>   '60s Fugitives</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s the creek's side canyons sheltered AWOL servicemen
and homeless squatters. Charles Manson was reputed to be among them.
In 1970, the Forest Service and the FBI led a sweep of the area and
found scores of ramshackle camps and several fugitives. That same
year the service banned overnight camping, a dictum more easily
proclaimed than enforced.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Manson's time, there were no patrols at all. There wasn't
much need," said Ranger Brad Burns. He joined the Forest Service in
1976 and later became responsible for law enforcement along the
22-mile Deep Creek and its environs. Two unarmed rangers patrolling
together were assaulted in 1977. At least a year passed before the
first charges were filed. Over time a crew of nine dwindled to one.
Now management rules allow rangers to carry firearms and require two
armed officers to mount a patrol. If Burns can't find a partner, the
sheriff is asked to supply a deputy.</TE>
<TE>   "No one else around even wants to take on the job," Burns said.
"People just don't want to get into it."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the lawbreaking today is limited to littering,
spray-painting rocks or motoring down one of the pedestrian-only
trails on a dirt bike or all-terrain vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest danger most soakers face is dehydration or, after a
lengthy immersion, a treatable skin rash caused by bacteria that
infects hair follicles.</TE>
<TE>   A Shady Past</TE>
<TE>   Deep Creek has drawn visitors from many parts of the world. Yet it
has not quite shed its checkered history of fatal accidents, strange
disappearances and occasional assaults, mostly growing out of drunken
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, a local man named Ronnie Bates disappeared. More than a
year later, a human jawbone was found near a trail, the few teeth
still on it eventually proving that it belonged to Bates. His death
remains a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   This past spring, authorities foiled plans for an outdoor dance
party near Deep Creek and confiscated 1,000 maps directing revelers
to the creek bottom "rave."</TE>
<TE>   Burns recently tore up nonnative vegetation illegally planted and
a "bootleg trail." The ranger times his patrols to advise visitors of
rule violations during daylight hours. Then he returns before dawn
and cites those who have ignored his warnings against overnight
stays.</TE>
<TE>   "I've survived down there because I use a great deal of
diplomacy," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   Land management officers also credit Castro.</TE>
<TE>   "We hear that Castro has taken a very hard line in enforcing
Forest Service and BLM rules," said Barry Nelson, the Bureau of Land
Management's chief ranger for the Barstow district. "There's no
question it helps our management efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Castro agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes Deep Creek unique is the private intervention," said
the leathery, long-haired 48-year-old. "This is a very spiritual
place. If it's not handled right, the place goes to hell."</TE>

<HD>Police Are Told to Curb Their Illegal Parking</HD>
<DH>Traffic: City officials say a space crunch near criminal
courthouse has been resolved and tell officers to stop leaving cars
in the red zone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The motorists who have been parking illegally next to the Criminal
Courts Building in downtown Los Angeles can't plead ignorance of the
law.</LD>
<LD>   After all, they are cops.</LD>
<LD>   Because of persistent overcrowding near the downtown Civic Center,
some law enforcement officers attending trials in the courthouse have
been parking in a no-stopping zone along Broadway between 1st and
Temple streets for several months.</LD>
<TE>   At the request of City Hall and LAPD officials, parking
enforcement officers have given cops a break, issuing only warnings
to badge-wearing violators. But city officials say the parking
problem has been resolved, and the grace period is over: Parking
enforcement officers vow to begin Tuesday to cite and tow all
illegally parked police cars.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not see officers parked there anymore," said Adena
Tessler, an aide to Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who helped
resolve the parking crunch.</TE>
<TE>   The illegally parked cars force northbound traffic on Broadway to
merge from three lanes to two.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday morning, a row of about 20 police cars lined the red
curb next to the courthouse. Two signs attached to street lights next
to the courthouse offer this added warning: "Law enforcement 'E'
plates and all others will be impounded."</TE>
<TE>   The windshields on several of the police vehicles were adorned
with yellow notices from the parking enforcement bureau, warning that
"future violations will result in citations."</TE>
<TE>   Still, police officers who parked at the red curb said they were
surprised to learn of the city's plans to target them. Some officers
argued that the no-parking zone does not apply to them because they
were on official police business.</TE>
<TE>   One officer insisted that the sign expressly exempts enforcement
vehicles. When a reporter pointed to the sign, noting that it clearly
warns that law enforcement cars will be impounded, the officer
responded: "That's all a matter of interpretation." He then drove
away.</TE>
<TE>   None of the officers spotted parking illegally identified
themselves to a reporter. "Call us Starsky and Hutch," joked a Los
Angeles Police detective as he and his partner got out of their
patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Sgt. John Pasquariello said the department issued a notice in
June, instructing all police officers attending court hearings to
park in a designated lot across the street from the courthouse. The
lot, owned by Los Angeles County, has 100 spaces set aside for law
enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   Pasquariello said law enforcement officers can also park at
metered spaces without paying, but they cannot ignore other parking
laws unless they are responding to an emergency call.</TE>
<TE>   Attending a court hearing does not qualify as an emergency, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Why are officers still parking illegally next to the courthouse?</TE>
<TE>   "The message doesn't always get down to the people who need it,"
Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers who are cited in the future will be responsible for
paying the tickets out of their own pockets, said Jimmy Price, the
city's chief of parking enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Parking has always been tight in downtown Los Angeles,
particularly around the Civic Center. Parking spaces became even more
elusive after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks prompted city officials
to eliminate dozens of spaces deemed dangerously close to government
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, police have complained that the 100 spaces set aside
for law enforcement often fill up quickly and that officers who left
to eat lunch or pick up a witness were not guaranteed a spot when
they returned.</TE>
<TE>   But that problem was resolved last month, when Miscikowski's
office and county officials designed a parking validation system that
allows police who park in the lot to return after leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, president of the Police Protection League, the union
that represents the LAPD rank and file, said the parking shortage
around the courthouse has been an ongoing problem. But she said that
does not exempt police officers from the city's parking restrictions.
Grasso said she plans to issue a warning in an upcoming union
newsletter, telling police not to park illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Still, several officers who parked illegally next to the
courthouse said the lack of available spaces leaves them no option
but to park in the no-parking zone.</TE>
<TE>   "Where can we park?" asked one LAPD detective who declined to give
his name.</TE>
<TE>   When a reporter noted that parking enforcement officials promised
to cite and tow all illegally parked vehicles next week, another
detective angrily responded: "They should impound all the police cars
so that when there is an emergency we can all walk there."</TE>

<HD>Quake Hazard Found at Seismic Office</HD>
<DH>Safety: Building leased by the state could be badly damaged
in a temblor, despite reinforcement, an engineer's report shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 89-year-old Washington building in downtown Los Angeles, leased
by the state to house hundreds of workers, including 30 seismic
safety engineers, does not meet building codes and would suffer
"potential severe damage" in a nearby moderate earthquake, an
engineer's report said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The report by Brandow and Johnston Associates, a structural
engineering firm, is part of a study required under the settlement of
a lawsuit by the seismic safety engineers against the state.</LD>
<LD>   The February settlement also required that, if such a finding were
made, the state must repair the building to bring it into compliance
with building codes or move the engineers elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state attorney general's office, which
prepared the settlement, said that after the report is reviewed, "a
determination will have to be made on whether to fix the problem or
move to a different building."</TE>
<TE>   The two seismic safety engineers who led the fight against moving
into the 13-story building at 311 S. Spring St., Bing-Nan Feng and
Schani Abeyesundere, now work in it, pursuant to the settlement.
Their unit occupies the 10th and 11th floors.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we have been vindicated by the engineer's report," Feng
said. "The report agrees with everything we have been saying. Now the
state should repair the building."</TE>
<TE>   The state pays more than $2 million a year to lease the Washington
building.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the approximately 300 state workers who occupy it were
moved from the Junipero Serra State Office Building at 1st Street and
Broadway years after it was declared seismically deficient following
the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   That building is empty and awaiting demolition.</TE>
<TE>   The seismic safety engineers, who are charged with ensuring the
earthquake safety of hospitals, resisted joining the move for months
because they insisted that, despite a $4.7-million seismic
retrofitting of the Washington building, it remained out of
compliance with the pertinent earthquake codes.</TE>
<TE>   The Brandow and Johnston report found that the building does not
meet the standards of the Uniform Building Code, or the standards set
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Applied Technology
Council.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the engineers' lawsuit, Mike Courtney, the deputy
director of the General Services Department, said: "We believe
strongly that we are moving these people to a much safer building"
than the Junipero Serra.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney has left the department, and spokesman Rob Deignan said
Friday that he could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The area of downtown Los Angeles in which the Junipero Serra and
Washington building are located is in a zone of apparent seismic
weakness.</TE>
<TE>   After the Northridge quake, one parking structure had to be
demolished and a $300-million retrofitting was undertaken nearby at
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The Caltrans regional headquarters is being replaced by a new,
stronger building.</TE>

<HD>CenterLine Rail Project Is Shortened Again</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The once-ambitious plan to connect north
and south commuter destinations now ends at Irvine City Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it the incredible shrinking rail line.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County's controversial CenterLine project is being trimmed
again. The proposed light rail line--initially pitched as a 35-mile
mass-transportation link from Fullerton to Irvine, then cut in
half--is now down to less than 12 miles and won't reach the Irvine
Spectrum, leading some to call it the "train to nowhere."</LD>
<LD>   That's not a sentiment many Irvine officials share. On Friday,
they called the latest revamped route a perfect starting place for a
high-tech rail system and said doubters will be begging to link their
neighborhoods to the line when service begins about 2011. The
alignment is being scaled back to eliminate a controversial link that
would have gone through three residential communities on its way to
the Irvine Spectrum.</LD>
<TE>   The Irvine City Council will vote Aug. 13 on whether to present
the scaled-back plan to the Orange County Transportation Authority,
the lead agency for the project. Authority officials say they are
prepared to shorten the route if asked.</TE>
<TE>   But in doing so, the final stop of the train is no longer a
transportation hub, business park and entertainment complex. It's
Irvine's remote civic center--a destination for few people.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to take this train system not just where it is needed,
but where it is wanted," said Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, explaining
the shortened route.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that opposition in neighborhoods the train would have
cut through will wither after the line starts running, and the city
can then work to expand it.</TE>
<TE>   "Once people see it, feel it and experience it, they tend to be
enthusiastic about linking their communities," Agran said. "This
system would be noise-free, pollution-free, and we think
aesthetically and functionally attractive."</TE>
<TE>   Officials displayed digitized images of what the futuristic train
cars would look like as they speed through the Irvine Business
Complex. They resemble the high-speed transportation system that
zipped city dwellers around in the film "Minority Report."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Leahy, chief executive officer of the OCTA, supported the
city's decision not to push the train system through resistant
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   But he warned that Irvine will have a difficult time expanding the
system to the Spectrum because it will have to compete for funds with
North County cities like Brea and Cypress, which are eager to link
onto the CenterLine at the Santa Ana side.</TE>
<TE>   "Other cities are already looking at expanding this line," said
Leahy. The shortened route unveiled Friday did little to comfort
opponents of the light-rail system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incremental approach to the same bad project," said
Irvine Councilman Greg Smith. "Citizens will still be faced with the
question of whether they want a 40-foot-high rail line running
through their backyards."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of CenterLine have launched a referendum drive to stop
Irvine from participating in the project, which would essentially
kill it. They will begin collecting signatures in an effort to get
the issue on the Irvine ballot in February.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, more than ever, we need to protect the city from this
boondoggle project," said Bill Mavity, treasurer of the group Fund
Alternatives Instead of Rail Transit. "You don't know where it will
go when they come back to expand it. And they will come back."</TE>

<HD>Pressure Mounts on Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP leaders and some of his advisors suggest he
release his tax returns. He reportedly rejects the advice and ignores
the issue at a national party meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Republican Bill Simon Jr. faced increased pressure Friday from GOP
leaders and some of his own campaign advisors to release his tax
returns in hopes of defusing what has become a major distraction in
his bid for California governor.</LD>
<LD>   But the candidate's chief strategist said Simon was still inclined
to keep his tax records private, and the candidate ignored the issue
altogether in an appearance before a San Francisco gathering of
national party leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The internal wrangling came as several of Simon's fellow
Republicans weighed in on the tax matter, urging full disclosure.
Most prominent among them was state Sen. Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga, the top Republican in the Legislature, who urged
businessman Simon in a private e-mail this week to divulge his tax
history in light of the current public focus on corporate ethics.</LD>
<TE>   "Unless there is something in your tax returns that would clearly
disqualify you from serving as governor or destroy your marriage, you
should rethink your position on not releasing them," Brulte wrote in
the e-mail, a copy of which was provided to The Times by a source who
had read the communication.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate's new campaign manager, Rob Lapsley, has also spoken
privately in favor of releasing the tax returns, according to
campaign insiders, as have other Simon advisors.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon himself, who was the featured luncheon speaker at
Friday's Republican meeting on Nob Hill, continued to resist the
calls for disclosure, campaign officials said.</TE>
<TE>   For three months, Gov. Gray Davis has demanded that his wealthy
GOP challenger release his returns to prove he "paid his fair share"
of California income taxes. The Democratic governor has pounded him
especially hard since the Internal Revenue Service named Simon last
week as a beneficiary of a tax shelter that it says might have been
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Friday to about 350 GOP loyalists, Simon avoided the
topic of his tax returns but told them he expected to face "one of
the most negative campaigns in political history."</TE>
<TE>   "I can promise you that just as mightily as Gray Davis tries to
distract the people of California from his own failures in so many
areas, I will not be deterred," Simon said. "We're going to stay on
message."</TE>
<TE>   But signs of the continuing tax distraction were evident
nevertheless. Before his speech, Simon aides told reporters that he
would take questions afterward, but the candidate instead ducked
through a kitchen door to avoid a fifth straight day of grilling on
the tax issue.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the hotel, television news cameras captured the scene of a
dozen Democratic Party protesters carrying signs saying, "No More Tax
Shelters" and "Secretive Simon: What Are You Hiding?"</TE>
<TE>   "Pay your taxes, Simon," a man shouted through a bullhorn.</TE>
<TE>   While the orchestrated Democratic criticism was predictable, it is
the unsolicited advice of fellow Republicans that suggested the issue
is beginning to unsettle Simon's backers.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Republicans urging Simon to release his tax returns was
former Rep. Tom Campbell, the party's U.S. Senate nominee from
California in 2000. "When you run for office, you've chosen to become
a public official, whether you win or not," Campbell said in an
interview this week with KTVU-TV in Oakland. Calling himself a friend
and supporter of Simon, he added: "I always disclosed. My advice:
Disclose. Show the public, because the risk politically is far
greater if you don't."</TE>
<TE>   With no consensus inside the campaign, Simon advisors are weighing
their options, sources familiar with the discussions said. They range
from sticking to Simon's refusal to disclose any returns to releasing
his complete federal and state returns since 1990, when he moved to
California.</TE>
<TE>   Simon told reporters earlier this week that he was not
"rethinking" his decision. On Friday, Sal Russo, Simon's chief
strategist, said that in a political campaign, "everything is on the
table," but added: "Our decision is not to release them. We could
choose to, but we don't intend to."</TE>
<TE>   Russo said he spoke to Simon's accountants during the Republican
primary about what was in the returns but did not review them
personally until this week.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing in them, and I've always known there's nothing in
them," Russo said. "It's merely respecting privacy for him, his
brother and his sisters, because they invest as a family. It
discloses information about them."</TE>
<TE>   But given the current political climate, with headlines dominated
by accounts of corporate chicanery and fast-and-loose accounting
practices, several of Simon's fellow Republicans said resisting the
calls for disclosure was untenable.</TE>
<TE>   "The days when you could say, 'It's none of your business' and 'My
finances are my own private matter' are gone," said Mike Hellon, a
Republican National Committee member from Arizona. "It clearly
deflects attention from Gray Davis' tenure in office, which it seems
to me is what the Simon people would want to be talking about."</TE>

<HD>State OKs Bleach Use for Ocean Sewage Line</HD>
<DH>Oceans: Process will disinfect effluent and should settle
Huntington Beach plume question.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water officials gave the Orange County Sanitation District
approval Friday to use up to 25,000 gallons of bleach a day to
disinfect the moderately treated sewage it pipes four miles offshore.</LD>
<LD>   The chlorination plan may do more than protect beachgoers'
health--it should finally prove whether any of the 243 million
gallons of waste water pumped off the coast daily is returning to
pollute Huntington Beach's coastline.</LD>
<LD>   "The district believes that the disinfection of its waste-water
discharge is in the best interest of the community," Bob Ghirelli,
director of technical services for the sanitation district, told the
Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board. "Your action will
help assure beachgoers that the coastal waters of Orange County are
safe."</LD>
<TE>   In addition to killing disease-causing microorganisms, the
disinfectant "will remove the question of our impact on Huntington
Beach's bacterial problem once and for all," said Blake Anderson,
district general manager.</TE>
<TE>   The chlorine kills the three types of bacteria coastal water is
tested for, so if high bacteria counts persist at area beaches,
Anderson said that would prove the waste water plume isn't to blame.
Millions of dollars have been spent on studies, yet there has been no
conclusion about whether the plume is responsible for beach-closings
and warnings that have plagued Surf City.</TE>
<TE>   Approval of the chlorination plan comes two days after the
sanitation district's board of directors voted narrowly to step up
waste-water treatment. In doing so, the board agreed not to seek
renewal of a federal waiver that has allowed the agency to dump
sewage treated to a lesser standard than nearly all of the nation's
16,000 sewer agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The waiver vote late Wednesday was a major victory for
environmentalists. The bleaching plan, however, divided activists.</TE>
<TE>   Some supported it, but with reservations. Others thought the
district was rushing through the approval process without considering
the potential harm to human health and the marine environment. Their
concerns grew when they heard that the plan--which will cost $10
million the first year and $7 million in subsequent years--was not
designed purely to focus on public safety, but rather was part a
costly experiment.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it designed for health protection, or is it designed to prove
a point, that [the pollution] is not coming from the outfall," asked
retired Newport Beach physician Jack Skinner, a longtime proponent of
cleaning up polluted waters.The district proposed the disinfectant
plan after tests showed that the offshore plume was returning to
within a half-mile of Newport Beach's coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 25,000 gallons of bleach will be used daily at the agency's
Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley plants. Another chemical,
similar to one used in aquariums, will then be added to neutralize
the chlorinated waste water.</TE>
<TE>   The regional board approved the plan 5-0 after two hours of
testimony and discussion. Members required more stringent offshore
testing in state waters, which extend three miles offshore. Board
officials noted that the sanitation district went beyond what was
required and agreed to make sure that the federal waters, where their
the sewage is discharged, meets state standards within 185 feet of
the outfall.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also must approve the
plan, said Terry Oda, an EPA hearing officer from San Francisco who
attended the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Bleaching is expected to begin in mid-August. Anderson said the
chlorine regimen, though used in 95% of the nation's sewer plants,
will be a temporary measure in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The agency will have a long-term, nontoxic disinfection method,
such as ultraviolet light, in place in three to five years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The promise that chlorination is a short-term solution pleased
environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Hoecherl, a staff attorney with the Natural Resources
Defense Council's Los Angeles office, said the chlorine would kill
the bacteria that the state uses as an indicator to judge the water
quality at local beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "Chlorine is much more effective at killing off indicator bacteria
... than it is at actually killing [disease-causing] viruses and
protozoa," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Skinner added, "It's tough to kill viruses with the level of
chlorine being looked at" and with the length of time it would be in
contact with the sewage.Hoecherl and others also expressed concern
about byproducts that would be formed when the chlorine reacts with
the sewage.</TE>

<HD>'Secret Valley' Area Called Vital Link to Fragile Trail
System</HD>
<DH>Nature: Land recently purchased by trust connects
recreational paths in Santa Monica Mountains that are also crucial to
local wildlife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By day, hikers raise clouds of dust as their boots dig into the
trail. Equestrians clop past towering rock formations. Sweaty
mountain bikers bounce over ruts and boulders for a thrill ride.</LD>
<LD>   By night, the Calabasas / Cold Creek Trail in the Santa Monica
Mountains is a different world as wildlife emerges. Mountain lions
tread stealthily in search of dinner. Grey foxes and coyotes skitter
through brush, while owls wheel silently overhead. Deer wander in
search of places to bed down.</LD>
<LD>   "This isn't only for humans," Jo Kitz of the Mountains Restoration
Trust said Friday during a four-wheel-drive tour of the trail for a
dozen state and local officials. "This functions as a wildlife
corridor and habitat."</LD>
<TE>   The nonprofit trust, which purchases land to preserve as open
space, arranged the tour in an effort to drive home the importance of
nature trails.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Harris, executive director of the trust, called the trail
system a fragile thread holding together a patchwork quilt of
publicly owned parklands in the Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Trails used by humans are crucial for wildlife migration, and
without paths between widely scattered open spaces, the animals would
disappear, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people like to see the deer, but it's much more than
that," he said. "A single mountain lion, for example, needs a lot of
territory to hunt. If you lose these open spaces and trails, you lose
the mountain lion, and what you have is a large influx of rodents in
populated areas."</TE>
<TE>   The trust used the occasion to dedicate Secret Valley, which the
Calabasas / Cold Creek Trail leads into. The recently purchased
property is described as a vital link in the trail system. The
40-acre parcel is south of Calabasas and just east of Mulholland
Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Trust officials said Secret Valley is a strategic part of the
200-mile trail system planned for the Santa Monica Mountains because
it connects to 10 existing trails, including the 65-mile Backbone
Trail, and eight parks.</TE>
<TE>   Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors, said places such as Secret Valley and the Calabasas /
Cold Creek Trail "are worth protecting with everything we've got."</TE>
<TE>   "This is our cathedral," he said during a stop on a trail
overlook. "We didn't take donations to make it. We didn't use slave
labor to make it. It was made for us. These mountains are as
beautiful as just about anything in California."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) agreed. The trail system
in the Santa Monicas makes it possible for millions of Los
Angeles-area residents to "visit nature without having to go, as Joni
Mitchell put it, to a tree museum," she said, referring to a line
from the 1970 protest song "Big Yellow Taxi."</TE>
<TE>   The 17-mile Calabasas / Cold Creek Trail and Secret Valley are in
the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many parks, about half of the 150,000-acre recreation
area--which stretches from Point Mugu in Ventura County to the
Hollywood Freeway--consists of housing developments and other
privately owned land. Groups such as the mountains trust and the
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy are attempting to buy undeveloped
parcels and convert them to parkland.</TE>
<TE>   The Calabasas / Cold Creek Trail has a marked access point just
south of Mountain Park Drive on Mulholland Highway, and an unmarked
entry gate on the north side of Stunt Road at mile-post marker 1.00.</TE>
<TE>   Kitz, who has been leading nature walks for 30 years, said trails
and open space are often underappreciated by most Americans. "I
really believe that the health of our country depends on the health
of our wild lands."</TE>

<HD>Jury's Insanity Verdict Saves Virk From Prison Sentence</HD>
<DH>Court: The woman who tried to drown her kids could not tell
right from wrong, panel decides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Port Hueneme mother was insane when she tried to drown her children
in Channel Islands Harbor 2 1/2 years ago, a Ventura County jury
decided Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated for nearly two days before concluding that
42-year-old Narinder Virk was suffering from severe depression and
could not tell right from wrong when she walked her son and daughter,
then 9 and 6, to the harbor the night of Jan. 12, 2000, and pushed
them off a dock.</LD>
<LD>   Virk, an illiterate Indian immigrant who maintained she was
isolated and battered by an abusive spouse, wept as the verdict was
announced in Ventura County Superior Court. Supporters seated in the
courtroom also broke into tears, relieved that she had been spared a
possible prison sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Virk's mental state will be evaluated to determine if she
needs treatment or can be released.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so happy. She does not belong in prison," said Kripa
Upadhyay, program coordinator of the South Asian Network in Artesia,
who attended much of the trial at the Ventura courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of this phase, it was the right verdict," Upadhyay said.
"But we never thought it would get this far."</TE>
<TE>   After Virk and her children were rescued by a harbor resident, the
mother was charged with attempted murder and pleaded not guilty by
reason of insanity. Defense lawyers tried to negotiate a plea on
lesser charges of child endangerment, but prosecutors refused to
settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   Following a three-week trial, jurors decided a week ago that Virk
was guilty on two counts of attempted murder. The trial advanced to a
second phase this week in which three mental health experts testified
that Virk was delusional, psychotic and legally insane at the time of
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Juror Mireya Carlson, a Thousand Oaks resident, said the testimony
of those experts was persuasive. "All of them said the same thing,"
she said, and "all of them could not possibly be biased."</TE>
<TE>   Another juror, who did not want to be identified, said cultural
evidence also swayed the panel's decision.</TE>
<TE>   During the sanity phase, UC Berkeley professor Robert Goldman, an
expert on South and Southeast Asian studies, testified that water
holds a spiritual connection in Indian culture. He testified that
drowning is one way in which some Indians choose to die.</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside the courthouse Friday, the anonymous juror said
there were many subtleties to the case and no one factor was key in
leading jurors to conclude that Virk was insane.</TE>
<TE>   "We all had a different approach, but we all came to the same
conclusion," he said. "She was not thinking clearly and was not using
rational thought.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't an easy decision," he added. "I've always been a
black-and-white type of person, but this one just tore that up."</TE>
<TE>   After the jury was excused Friday, Virk, draped in a pale green
Punjabi scarf, was taken into custody to undergo a six-week
psychiatric evaluation at Ventura County Jail to determine whether
she is still suffering from a mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   As she was walked to a holding cell, she reached out and embraced
one of her chief supporters, 68-year-old Nina Sloan of La Puente, who
put up $250,000 in cash and property toward Virk's $500,000 bail and
has attended nearly every day of trial.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan said that Virk, speaking in her native Punjabi, told her: "I
don't want to go." But Sloan said she tried to reassure the weeping
defendant, telling her that "God would be with her."</TE>
<TE>   Before the verdict was announced, Sloan and defense attorney
Cynthia Ellington had tried to prepare Virk, knowing she would be
taken into custody either way the jury ruled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very grateful for the decision," Ellington said. "They
listened to our evidence.... That woman was incredibly mentally ill.
And she still is."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County mental health experts will evaluate Virk's
condition in the coming weeks and prepare reports before a Sept. 9
court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   If the experts conclude that she is still insane, Virk would
likely be sent to Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino County for
treatment, lawyers said. But if her sanity is deemed restored, Virk
could be released from custody.</TE>
<TE>   "The interesting question now is whether her sanity is the same as
it was before," said prosecutor Richard Simon. He said the Ventura
County district attorney's office would likely oppose any request for
Virk's release.</TE>
<TE>   As for the verdict, Simon said he was disappointed but respected
the jury's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question she has a mental illness; the question was
whether that [illness] caused her actions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Simon argued that Virk deliberately tried to
kill her two children to punish her estranged husband, who had
boarded a plane for India that night with plans to divorce her. Simon
agued that Virk knew what she was doing and left a trail of evidence
that showed planning and premeditation.</TE>
<TE>   But Ellington told jurors that Virk was suffering from severe
depression brought on by years of spousal abuse and isolation.
Ellington argued that her client snapped when the husband walked out
and acted in the midst of an insane delusion.</TE>
<TE>   For the past 1 1/2 years, Virk has been free on bail and working
as a housekeeper and caregiver for a woman with Parkinson's disease.
Sympathizers hope she will be released from custody and eventually
allowed contact with her son and daughter, now 11 and 8, who are
living with their father in Port Hueneme.</TE>

<HD>Judge's Ruling Will Net School District Millions</HD>
<DH>Court: Yorba Linda Redevelopment Agency must pay more than
$240 million over 30 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County Superior Court judge ruled this week that Yorba
Linda's Redevelopment Agency has illegally kept tax funds from local
schools and now must pay more than $240 million to the district,
school officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a $240-million victory for the students," said Dennis
Smith, superintendent of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School
District. "The money will really allow us to fulfill our dreams so
important to our kids."</LD>
<LD>   Part of the dream is building a high school, Smith said, the first
one in Yorba Linda.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling, reached Wednesday but made public Friday, caps a
three-year legal battle between the two agencies over tax funds
generated by city's redevelopment plan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, the city formed the redevelopment agency to help spur
growth in the community. Because of the foreseeable impact on
schools, the redevelopment agency agreed to compensate the school
district with a portion of the growth in tax revenue. The two parties
could never agree on the amount, however, and the school district
sued.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Robert Gallivan ruled that the district is
owed about $7 million in past revenue, and that the redevelopment
agency must pay an additional $240 million over the next 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   It is a tentative ruling because accountants must double-check the
calculations.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have maintained that the amounts sought by the
district were excessive. City Manager Terrence Belanger said Friday
that council members will review the ruling at a meeting perhaps as
early as next week, and decide whether to accept or appeal the
judge's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day," Belanger said, "[we] are all serving the
same constituency and we must find ways to work cooperatively."</TE>
<TE>   The Placentia-Yorba Linda district serves 27,000 students in both
cities and parts of Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The district this year passed a $102-million construction bond
measure that included only planning phases for a new high school. The
redevelopment funds, Smith said, will allow the district to build the
high school.</TE>

<HD>Summer Lunch Plan Lags in Some Counties</HD>
<DH>Nutrition: Unaffected by a downturn in other Southland
areas, Ventura County is keeping pace with need and retaining
sponsors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last summer, Covina Park bustled with the energy of children eating
free lunches courtesy of a federal program designed to provide
low-income youngsters with a nutritious meal during vacation.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the park is quiet, the food program dropped because of
a budget crunch and doubt that federal reimbursements would cover the
costs.</LD>
<LD>   In Compton, where children received free summer lunches last year,
alternatives are being sought, after several community groups opted
not to sponsor the lunches because of complex rules and onerous
paperwork.</LD>
<TE>   The Covina and Compton cases are not isolated. Nationally and in
California, the summer nutrition program is struggling, plagued by
the loss of sponsors and inability to meet the needs of millions of
eligible children. The program is the largest federal effort to feed
low-income children during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   The nutrition programs in Ventura County have, so far, avoided
this downturn. Billie Hayes, who co-coordinates the summer free lunch
program sponsored by the Ventura Unified School District, said there
had been no cutbacks this year in this county, where about 2,000
meals are served each weekday.</TE>
<TE>   "I know some of the kids would not be eating lunch if it wasn't
for this program," said Patti Birmingham, director of operations for
the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Ventura, one of 26 lunch sites in Ventura
County. Summer lunch programs at local school sites ended Friday, but
10 others will continue through Aug. 16.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the number of sponsors for summer nutrition programs in
California declined by 6%, according to recent studies. That
reflected a national trend in which 47,000 fewer children--a decline
of 2.3% from the year before--received the summer meals.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates said the decrease appears to be continuing this year. In
addition to the loss of sponsors they blame the public's spotty
awareness of the meals.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Sharpe, regional director of the California Food Policy
Advocates, a group that works to ease hunger, recalled his efforts to
enlist six Los Angeles-area churches to sponsor new feeding sites
this year. All chose not to.</TE>
<TE>   "Some said it was too much government hassle, too much paperwork,"
he said. "Some said they hadn't realized how many children they would
have to feed to break even."</TE>
<TE>   Some counties in California lost more ground last year than
others, according to a recent survey by the Food Policy Advocates. In
Ventura County the number of sites serving free lunches dropped to
three in 2001 from 20 the year before. The number of sites in Los
Angeles serving food declined to 616 from 656. Orange County
maintained most of its centers, replacing sponsors that dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   "For kids on summer recess in these areas, not having access to
the summer lunch program puts their families in a difficult
position," said Michael Flood, executive director of the Los Angeles
Regional Food Bank. "For many, the only other option is charitable
food from a pantry."</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, Congress initiated summer lunches as a pilot program,
which was extended nationwide in 1975. School districts, nonprofit
agencies, universities, and city, county and Native American tribal
governments can be sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Many sites also provide recreational and educational activities.
The sponsors can prepare their own meals or pay for food preparation
and be reimbursed by the U.S Department of Agriculture according to a
complex set of guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates say those guidelines--some designed to prevent
fraud--pose barriers for potential sponsors. In addition, Congress,
in overhauling welfare laws, cut reimbursement rates and eliminated
some start-up funds.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Covina dropped its one summer meal site this year
after anticipating that it would not be able to pay $4,000 for
staffing, said recreation services supervisor Carren Chaney. For
example, sponsors have to make sure that parents don't eat food meant
for kids.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Rodgers, who helps to direct a city-run day camp at a
Compton park, said the summer lunch program attracted many families.
But after it was dropped by its church sponsor a year ago, some
families now go to charitable food giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles' Parks and Recreation Department operates
100 summer lunch sites. About 25% of the $1.6 million spent on the
program last year--mostly for staffing-- was picked up by taxpayers,
said manager Vicki Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is if the mayor and City Council did not support the
program we'd have to reduce or cancel it," she said. "Maybe the USDA
needs to provide more money per meal. The funding we get has remained
constant but cost of caterers, transportation, gasoline all keeps
going up."</TE>
<TE>   Israel cited the example of one caterer who ran out of 100% fruit
juice drinks and had to deliver 80% juice instead. Because of strict
rules, the city was not reimbursed for the juice, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The growth of year-round schools in Los Angeles and other cities
has further complicated matters. While more youngsters are in school
during summer and get free lunches there, most of those school-based
programs will not serve neighborhood children on vacation. Los
Angeles officials have set up 34 sites to serve lunches year round,
but Israel said twice as many are needed.</TE>
<TE>   In California last year, 37% of the 1.8 million children who
received a free school lunch participated in the summer program,
according to the state Department of Education. California's rate
ranks among the top three, according to a national survey by the Food
Research and Action Center. But advocates say there is still much
unmet need.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and advocates are looking at ways to keep the program
going and increase participation. In California this year, the USDA
made it easier for school districts serving school lunches to provide
summer lunches. Sen. Dick Luger (R-Indiana) last month introduced
legislation to help ease paperwork and increase reimbursements.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pedro Martinez outpitched Mike Mussina in a marquee matchup that
lived up to its billing, sending the Boston Red Sox over the New York
Yankees, 4-2, Friday night in the opener of a three-game series at
New York.</LD>
<LD>   Shea Hillenbrand had two runs batted in, and Nomar Garciaparra
drove in the first run with a sacrifice fly foul out to first baseman
Nick Johnson--undercut by second baseman Alfonso Soriano near the
tarp. Boston beat the Yankees for the eighth time in 12 meetings and
cut its deficit in the AL East to two games.</LD>
<LD>   Yankee catcher Jorge Posada made a key throwing error and struck
out four times, stranding the potential tying run on third in the
eighth.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Sox have won four in a row after a four-game skid. New
York lost for only the fifth time in 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   Throwing as hard as he has all season, Martinez (12-2) struck out
nine to increase his AL-leading total to 158. He gave up two runs and
five hits over 7 1/3 innings. Martinez walked three, hit Robin
Ventura with a pitch twice and was lifted after throwing 114 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 10, Texas 0--Cory Lidle picked a spectacular way to prove
he still belongs in the Athletics' rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Lidle pitched a one-hitter, giving up only Juan Gonzalez's leadoff
double in the eighth inning in a victory at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   After winning only once in his previous 12 starts, Lidle (3-8) was
nothing short of masterful. He got within six outs of the 11th
no-hitter in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Detroit 1--Corey Koskie and David Ortiz homered on
the first two pitches of the fourth inning at Detroit to back Kyle
Lohse's solid pitching in the Twins' victory.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Mientkiewicz had a home run as the Twins handed the Tigers
their fourth consecutive loss and took a 12-game lead over Chicago in
the AL Central.</TE>
<TE>   Lohse (9-5) gave up one run and six hits in six innings. Johan
Santana pitched three innings for his first major league save.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 10, Chicago 4--Rodrigo Lopez pitched seven strong
innings to earn his 10th victory, and the Orioles used a six-run
fourth to pull away at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez (10-3) gave up three runs and six hits to become the first
rookie to win 10 games for Baltimore since Rocky Coppinger in 1996.
The right-hander had a career-high eight strikeouts and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 11, Tampa Bay 8--Tom Wilson hit a three-run homer at
Toronto as the Blue Jays sent the Devil Rays to their team-record
12th consecutive road loss.</TE>

<HD>Early Return for Erstad</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Darin Erstad missed three games and was expected to miss at least a
few more because of an infected blood blister atop his left foot.</LD>
<LD>   But the gritty center fielder returned to the lineup Friday night
against the Seattle Mariners and helped the Angels in their 15-3
victory at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   "I never thought [Thursday] that I would be able to play today,
but it's amazing what medicine can do," Erstad said.</LD>
<TE>   Erstad hit a double to the right-field gap and scored a run in the
first inning, singled in the second inning, walked and scored in the
fourth, hit a fly ball to left in the fifth and walked and scored in
the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   He ran without noticeable discomfort, but appeared to be in pain
while trotting to the dugout after scoring runs.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia was surprised Erstad was ready from a
physical standpoint, but knew Erstad was ready mentally.</TE>
<TE>   "He came be-bopping in like he was a kid that just sat through
three days of rain and couldn't go out and play," Scioscia said. "He
usually comes to the park ready to play. This was even more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Al Levine will be activated from the disabled list today.
Reliever Matt Wise will be sent to triple-A Salt Lake for the third
time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Wise was recalled from Salt Lake on Monday when Troy Percival was
placed on the disabled list retroactive to July 12, but had not
pitched until working the ninth inning Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Wise is out of options, meaning the Angels must keep him on the
major league roster next season or put him on waivers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Percival said he will not need a rehabilitation assignment before
rejoining the team July 27.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be back the day I'm available," said Percival, who ranks
fourth in the American League with 22 saves. "I'll be ready to throw
[in the bullpen] two or three days from now. I'll be ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Jose Molina, making his second start in place of his
injured brother Bengie, faced a Mariner team that entered the game
leading the American League with 91 stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   Jose was recalled from Salt Lake on Wednesday after Bengie was put
on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained left hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners did not waste time challenging Jose. Ichiro Suzuki
tried to steal second base in the first inning and made it
unchallenged when Molina committed a passed ball on a pitchout.</TE>
<TE>   Bret Boone stole second base in the second inning and advanced to
third on Molina's throwing error.</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Get Finley in Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Cardinals, desperate for another starter since Darryl
Kile's death, acquired left-hander Chuck Finley from the Cleveland
Indians on Friday night for minor league first baseman Luis Garcia
and a player to be named.</LD>
<LD>   The deal was completed before the Cardinals lost to Pittsburgh,
12-9, but was held up pending the approval of Major League Baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Because the Indians are picking up a share of the $4 million-plus
still owed Finley in the last year of his $27 million, three-year
contract, baseball's approval would be required.</LD>
<TE>   Finley is a proven winner in the majors, with seven seasons of 15
victories or more and a 193-169 career record. But he is only 4-11
with a 4.44 earned-run average this season in 18 starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Graeme Lloyd, appalled by the prospect of pitching again
for Florida owner Jeffrey Loria, has asked an arbitrator to reverse
the eight-player trade that sent him to the Marlins from the Montreal
Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd says the deal July 11 violated a no-trade clause in his
contract. It listed the Marlins as one of 12 teams he couldn't be
traded to, but his agents apparently missed by one day a deadline to
renew the clause last Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   If Lloyd's appeal is upheld, he could be returned to the Expos.
The appeal is unlikely to affect Montreal's acquisition of outfielder
Cliff Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee right fielder Raul Mondesi was hospitalized
overnight because of shortness of breath and released Friday. The
Yankees said Mondesi underwent tests at Montefiore Hospital, which
were negative, but he was not with the team for Friday's game against
Boston.... Texas Ranger closer Hideki Irabu was released from a
Kansas City hospital, five days after being diagnosed with a series
of small blood clots in his lungs. Irabu was hospitalized at St.
Luke's Hospital after complaining of chest pains and shortness of
breath Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Twin outfielder Torii Hunter was suspended for three
games and fined for throwing a ball at Cleveland's Danys Baez. Hunter
decided not to challenge the penalty and will start serving the
suspension, imposed by baseball vice president Bob Watson, today....
Yankee pitcher Orlando Hernandez was suspended for five games and
fined $1,000 by the commissioner's office for hitting Toronto's
Carlos Delgado with a pitch earlier this week. Because he appealed,
Hernandez can pitch today against the Boston Red Sox and fellow Cuban
right-hander Rolando Arrojo.... Colorado Rockies' reliever Todd Jones
received a $1,000 fine for throwing at Seattle Mariner second baseman
Bret Boone two weeks ago. Jones received a letter from baseball vice
president Bob Watson on Thursday, which said he was being fined for
intentionally throwing at Boone's head on June 28.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Diamondback right-hander Rick Helling, who had been
scheduled to start this weekend, was put on the 15-day disabled list
because of a sprained right ankle. The move was retroactive to
Tuesday.... The Minnesota Twins activated right-hander Joe Mays and
he will start today against the Tigers for the first time since
facing Detroit April 14. He had had muscle and tendon inflammation in
his right elbow.... The Houston Astros recalled Kirk Saarloos, a
former Cal State Fullerton standout, from triple-A New Orleans, and
the right-hander will start today's game against the Chicago Cubs.
Saarloos made three starts for the Astros in June, going 0-2 with a
17.65 ERA.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As baseball players and management finally got around to talking
about revenue sharing Friday, baseball Commissioner Bud Selig
reversed course and told owners to stop making public statements
about labor matters.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators, joined by eight players from the Boston Red Sox, had
what both sides called a productive session, and agreed that they
were not that far apart on the amount of money they want to divide
unequally among clubs from baseball's national broadcasting and
licensing contracts.</LD>
<LD>   They did not discuss locally generated revenue or management's
desire for a luxury tax on high-payroll teams, two bigger points of
contention in the talks for a labor deal to replace the contract that
expired Nov. 7.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, team owners received a new memorandum from Selig, who
earlier this summer had lifted his so-called "gag order." In the last
few weeks, many owners have spoken out in support of Selig's attempt
to gain economic concessions from players.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate all the helpful and supportive comments that have
been made by owners and club officials in recent weeks," Selig said
in the memo, which was read to the Associated Press. "The comments
were indicative of the complete unity of the clubs on the labor
front.</TE>
<TE>   "Notwithstanding this fact, I have decided to reinstitute the ban
on public comments on labor and economic issues in its original
format.</TE>
<TE>   "We are entering a critical period of the labor negotiations and I
feel that further comment at this point would not be productive."</TE>

<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortstop Cesar Izturis ranged behind the second base bag for David
Bell's game-opening grounder, scooped it up and fired to first to
retire the Giants' leadoff batter Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   That, in a nutshell, is why Izturis remains a Dodger starter
despite his .231 batting average and National League-low .256 on-base
percentage entering Friday night's game.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not going to pick on Cesar Izturis, not when we have six
guys swinging the bat like that," Manager Jim Tracy said in response
to a question about Izturis' job status. "He wasn't brought here to
hit .300 this year. He's 22, he's a switch hitter ... he's a sound,
sound defensive player. I won't even start talking about that."</LD>
<TE>   Izturis was batting .303 from the right side but .200 from the
left side before Friday. Only one player in the major league's,
Kansas City's Neifi Perez (.254), had a lower on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   But Izturis has been the Dodgers' best defensive player, so he
remains in the big leagues while Felipe Lopez, the .226-hitting
shortstop the Blue Jays kept instead of Izturis, was demoted to
triple-A Syracuse on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Offense is offense, and I forget about it while I'm playing
defense," Izturis said. "That part of it hasn't been hard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darren Dreifort, continuing his comeback from elbow surgery, threw
a two-inning, 41-pitch simulated game Friday, his second this week.
The right-hander will throw one or two more simulated games in the
next week to 10 days before embarking on a minor league
rehabilitation assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Though Dreifort didn't feel he pitched as consistently Friday as
he did Monday, "I felt like I could keep going--I didn't feel tired
or weak or anything else," he said. "I have no problem airing it out.
I cleared that hurdle long ago."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown, who underwent surgery for a herniated disk in his
lower back on June 11 and has been sidelined since May 27 because of
back and elbow problems, will begin throwing off a mound Monday. "As
soon as my body tells me I'm ready to go," Brown said, "I will go."</TE>

<HD>Can't Use Staff to Lean On</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Much of recent slide can be blamed on starting
pitchers Ashby, Daal and Perez, who have struggled since All-Star
break.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The struggling Dodger offense has deservedly received much of the
blame for the club's latest slide with a National League playoff
berth at stake.</LD>
<LD>   The pitching staff has gotten off easier, though maybe it
shouldn't.</LD>
<LD>   Starters Andy Ashby, Omar Daal and Odalis Perez have not
maintained the impressive form that helped make the Dodgers one of
the major leagues' biggest first-half surprises, requiring Hideo Nomo
and Kazuhisa Ishii to shoulder more responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   Nomo experienced the pressure of playoff races in his first stint
in Los Angeles and Ishii brought a big-game reputation from Japan, so
the Dodgers have reason for optimism on that front.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown and Darren Dreifort are making progress recovering
from surgeries, encouraging some in the organization to believe they
might be activated in August.</TE>
<TE>   And Manager Jim Tracy, with the club having two more days off in
July, can shuffle the rotation to give the most tired pitchers extra
rest.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii had another effective outing Friday night, giving up two
runs in six innings, but he did not get the decision as the Dodgers
struggled again, losing to the San Francisco Giants, 3-2, in 12
innings at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "The pitching staff, collectively, has carried us all year, and
that's something you have to keep in mind," catcher Paul Lo Duca
said. "Ash and Odalis are just in little ruts right now, but they're
healthy, and I think Omar will be fine too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just that now we're going the second time around the league,
and it's about making adjustments. But you've also got to look at the
fact that we're on the verge of getting Dreif and Brownie back soon,
and that's going to be a key."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Dodgers don't know what to expect from Dreifort,
coming off reconstructive elbow surgery for the second time in six
years, or Brown, sidelined most of the last two seasons because of
injuries and rehabilitating from surgery for a herniated disk.
General Manager Dan Evans is trying to add a power setup man to help
closer Eric Gagne, baseball officials on other teams said, but the
Dodgers are not expected to acquire another starter.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers said the group has gotten them this far, and they're
going to stick with what has worked for most of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Our pitching has been pretty good, and we're built on pitching,
so we're not looking at this [nine]-game string and discounting what
happened the previous 85 or 90 games. It's just not the way things
work," Evans said. "This is exactly why we didn't build the club
around offense, because offense is unpredictable and cyclical.
Offense goes into slumps."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, pitchers do too.</TE>
<TE>   The staff was riding high, going 54-34 with a 3.56 earned-run
average before the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   The group's ERA rose to 5.22 during the recent rough stretch, with
the starters causing most of the problems at 6.04.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, Daal and Perez have been especially ineffective in July.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who missed most of last season after having elbow surgery,
is 0-2 with a 6.48 ERA in three starts. Perez is 1-2 with an 8.27
ERA, and Daal 1-2 with a 7.36 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are confident that Ashby, Daal and Perez, who has
established a personal best with a team-high 139 1/3 innings, will
catch their second wind.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of that is mental," said Dave Wallace, a team vice
president and former pitching coach. "At some point, after you've
been in the big leagues for a while, you have to [just deal with it].</TE>
<TE>   "That's not to say if you have a chance you don't, where days off
permit, maybe skip one of 'em, which we've done before. But you're
getting to the tough time of year, and this is when you find out."</TE>

<HD>Trnka Signs Two-Year Deal</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck defenseman Pavel Trnka signed a two-year contract
believed to be worth about $1.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   Trnka, who made $625,000 last season, had filed for arbitration.
He will make $900,000 this season and $1 million in 2003-04.</LD>
<LD>   Trnka, who will turn 26 next week, had a solid season after
battling injuries the previous two seasons. He played a career-high
71 games, with two goals and 13 points.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration dates have been set for Duck center Matt Cullen and
defenseman Ruslan Salei.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen is more likely to go through with his arbitration date,
which is scheduled for Aug. 4. He made $484,000 last season, $1
million under the NHL average, and finished with career highs in
goals (18) and points (48). He led the Ducks with 30 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Salei, one of the Ducks' top defensemen, made $950,000 last
season, which is less than the Ducks will be paying defensemen
Fredrik Olausson ($1.1 million plus incentives) and Vitaly Vishnevski
($1.075 million). Salei has an Aug. 7 arbitration date.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck left wing Paul Kariya and center Steve Rucchin, who were
eligible for arbitration, did not file and are seeking multiyear
deals.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya, the Ducks' all-time leader in goals and points, is coming
off career lows in goals (32) and points (57) for a full season. He
may accept his qualifying offer, which would be a one-year,
$10-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin, who has missed 110 of the Ducks' 164 games because of
injuries the last two seasons, is coming off a four-year,
$9.2-million contract that paid him $2.55 million last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks hired Brad Shaw to coach Cincinnati, their minor league
affiliate. Shaw, 38, spent the last three seasons in the Tampa Bay
organization and was a Lightning assistant coach in 1999-2000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Australia's Paul Gow shot a six-under-par 66 to take the clubhouse
lead in the second round of the B.C. Open at Endicott, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Gow had a two-round total of 11-under 139 on the En-Joie Golf Club
course, where lightning and rain around midday forced a delay of
nearly 4 hours 15 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   When play resumed, Shaun Micheel went out in a blazing five-under
32 for the front nine and was 11 under through 15 holes when darkness
stopped play for the day.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Robbins had two eagles in an eight-under 64 for a share of
the lead with Beth Bader in the rain-delayed first round of the Giant
Eagle LPGA Classic at Vienna, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins holed a bunker shot on the par-five No. 5, then hit driver
and three-wood to four feet for another eagle at the par-five No. 8.
Bader had 10 birdies and two bogeys for the best score of her career.
The 64s were the lowest competitive rounds ever shot at Squaw Creek
Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ted Goin, winless in two seasons on the Senior PGA Tour, shot a
bogey-free six-under 66 to take a one-stroke lead after the first
round of the SBC Senior Open at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time champion Hale Irwin, Roy Vucinich, Bob Eastwood and Tom
Wargo opened with 67s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lee Williamson and Ryan Moore each won two matches to advance to
the final of the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship at Washington
Township, Mich. The winner will receive a spot in the 2003 Masters,

<HD>Hofmans Has Busy Day</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Dave Hofmans is hoping for a formful result in the $250,000
Delaware Oaks at Delaware Park and an upset in the $350,000 Coaching
Club American Oaks at Belmont Park.</LD>
<LD>   Hofmans, who is winning at about 20% for the year, will send out
likely favorite Adoration in Delaware and longshot Linda Eder in New
York.</LD>
<LD>   A daughter of Honor Grades owned by Amerman Racing, Adoration was
a two-time stakes winner this spring at Hollywood Park. She followed
her win in the Senorita on turf with a main track score in the
Hollywood Oaks. Garrett Gomez will ride Adoration, who will have
seven opponents in the Grade III, which is run at 1 1/16 miles on
dirt.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Jerry Frankel and named for his friend, a singer who
performed at Belmont Park on Belmont Stakes day, Linda Eder is likely
to be the longest price in the CCA Oaks, a 1 1/2-mile Grade I and the
final leg of New York's Triple Tiara for 3-year-old fillies.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Eder, the thoroughbred, has won two of her last three, but
those races were on the grass and today's race will be only her
second start on dirt. In her only other outing on the main track, she
was second against maidens over a sloppy surface on March 9 at the
Fair Grounds in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The likely favorite is Chamrousse, who has won three of seven for
trainer Niall O'Callaghan.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, she was second as the 6-5 choice in the Mother
Goose, which was won by Nonsuch Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth is a wide-open turf route (1 1/16
miles) for older claimers racing for a $40,000 tag. It is also the
third leg of the Churchill Downs simulcast network pick four. The
other races in the wager are the 12th from Calder, the ninth from
Arlington Park and the ninth from Ellis Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Velasquez. The jockey has been consistent
throughout Belmont Park's meet, which ends Sunday, and he is going to
win the title.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: La Chaiym. The 5-year-old gelding, who has lost his
last four starts by a combined 116 1/2 lengths, is in for more
punishment in today's seventh at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three with The Denver Dream, Saucy Cat
and Dinnerathepalms in the third, singling Retro Fever in the fourth
and Lammas, Worthy Deed and Come Back Ronnie in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 1/163. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $6.60/$923.40. Total money bet: $1,066.</TE>

<LD>Looking for his sixth victory in 12 starts, Check Him Out will debut
for a new trainer in tonight's $27,400 Vandys Flash Handicap at 400
yards.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old Hennessy colt, who won the 2001 Ed Burke Futurity,
is now trained by Blane Schvaneveldt, who also owns Check Him Out in
partnership with John Andreini and breeder Zory Kuzyk. Previously,
the California-bred, who has earned nearly $259,000, had raced for
Kuzyk and Wayne Lukas and had been trained by Laura Lukas.</LD>
<LD>   The co-highweight with Babe Watcher at 125 pounds in the Vandys
Flash, Check Him Out will be making his first start since April 26,
when he finished third as the 3-5 favorite in the El Primero Del Ano
Derby.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. What A Swetie T T 2. Indigodash. 3. Absolutely
Yours. 4. Shania Fame. 5. Juan Gordito. 6. Easter Chief. 7. Watch
This Injun. 8. Star Savona. 9. Rio Cheng. 10. Check Him Out. 11. Heza
Quick Dash.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use What A Swetie T T and Chillee in the first, Indigodash
and Buzzin On By in the second, Virama and Absolutely Yours in the
third and Shania Fame, IB In Touch and Catch You Later in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Induction Day finished well clear of the field
when second at 22-1 in his latest and could be ready to break through
for trainer Harry Nelson in the sixth. Caperucita Roja is a big
threat in the eighth if ready for trainer Zvi Kriple.</TE>

<HD>Prior Has a Handle on Astros</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No way Mark Prior was going to let the Houston Astros get to him
again.</LD>
<LD>   Prior allowed two hits and struck out eight, and Moises Alou
homered against his old team as the Chicago Cubs defeated the Astros,
5-0, Friday at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "He threw great," said Craig Biggio, who got Houston's only
extra-base hit against Prior. "He never made any mistakes out over
the plate and really pitched a great game. He's good."</LD>
<TE>   Alex Gonzalez drove in two runs and slumping Corey Patterson added
an RBI for the Cubs, 6-2 since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson Cruz (1-5) struck out a career-high eight and gave up only
two hits in 5 1/3 innings. But one of those hits was Alou's solo
homer, and that was all the Cubs needed to back Prior (4-2).</TE>
<TE>   "I came in today and wanted to do some things," Prior said.
"Obviously I wanted to get back at them from the other outing I had."</TE>
<TE>   Prior, the second pick in last summer's amateur draft, had his
worst start in the majors when he faced the Astros for the first time
June 1. He gave up a whopping seven runs in 3 2/3 innings that day,
and needed 95 pitches to get there.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Prior didn't give up a walk, and has given up two
earned runs or fewer in eight of his 11 starts.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Cincinnati 2--Mike Piazza, Edgardo Alfonzo and Roberto
Alomar hit solo home runs, and the Mets took advantage of a missed
call at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets led 3-1 in the fifth when the Reds loaded the bases with
one out.</TE>
<TE>   Austin Kearns then hit a high fly and left fielder Timo Perez
jumped as he approached the fence. The ball hit about three feet
above Perez, caromed off the wall and bounced right into his glove.</TE>
<TE>   But the play was ruled a catch, with Perez holding his glove
aloft, and he threw back to second base to double off Todd Walker
before Brady Clark could tag up and score.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 6, Arizona 1--Ryan Klesko had a triple and double among
his four hits and scored three times at San Diego as the Padres
earned their fifth consecutive victory over the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Klesko went four for four and was a home run short of becoming the
first player to hit for the cycle in the Padres' 34-year history.
Bubba Trammell was three for three with three RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Philadelphia 1--Damian Moss pitched six strong innings
and Andruw Jones homered as the Braves won at Philadelphia. Atlanta
has won 21 of its last 27 games.</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones had two hits and two runs scored, and Gary Sheffield
doubled to reach base for his 45th consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 12, St. Louis 9--Rob Mackowiak hit a two-run pinch
homer in the seventh inning at Pittsburgh after the Pirates
squandered a five-run lead built on Adam Hyzdu's grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 9, Milwaukee 5--Todd Hollandsworth and Gary Bennett drove
in three runs each, and Shawn Chacon won at home for the first time
in nearly three months as the Rockies beat the Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Montreal 2--The Marlins ended an eight-game losing
streak, winning for the first time since the All-Star break as
Michael Tejera (6-2) won at Miami.</TE>

for the 200-meter backstroke final in the Janet Evans Invitational
swim meet Friday at USC.</LD>
<LD>   There they stood: two old rivals, stone-faced, looking toward the
pool deck, shaking their arms. Then, almost by instinct, each slowly
turned his head toward the other. Their eyes met and, since it was a
once-familiar sight neither had seen in a while, each cracked a grin.</LD>
<LD>   "Just like old times," Peirsol said.</LD>
<TE>   Well, not exactly.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Peirsol won. He swam the race in 1:59.09 and edged
Krayzelburg by 0.24 seconds. The last time the world's premier 200
backstrokers met was at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and Krayzelburg
edged Peirsol to win the gold medal. Krayzelburg took time away from
competition, then had surgery on his left shoulder last August. The
rivalry went on hiatus until Friday's highly anticipated renewal.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, Peirsol broke Krayzelburg's world record in the
event, winning in 1:55.15 at the U.S. Spring Nationals in March to
better the 1:55.87 Krayzelburg swam in 1999. Neither expected the
times to be quite as fast as they were Friday, but both acknowledged
the competitive juices took over.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell we both wanted to win real bad," Peirsol said.
"This race was a big deal, but not in the sense that we were going
for a world record. Just the return of Lenny was big."</TE>
<TE>   Krayzelburg said he didn't think much about facing Peirsol before
the race. He was more concerned that he hadn't clocked better than
2:03 in the 200 since his surgery. Friday was supposed to be a test
for his shoulder, a race to determine if he should stick with the 200
or leave it to focus on the 100. One glance at Peirsol changed that.</TE>
<TE>   "He brings out the best in me," said Krayzelburg. "I think it's
going to be quite an exciting rivalry in the next few years. I guess
I proved to myself that I'm not ready to go away yet. Today changed
my views about the 200."</TE>
<TE>   Peirsol, who led start to finish, applauded Krayzelburg's
decision. He said he needed his old rival back to keep himself
motivated.</TE>
<TE>   "The race has been a little different without him," said Peirsol,
who last beat Krayzelburg in 2000, also at this meet. "I really
flourished in his absence, but it's going to be that much more of a
challenge with him back. I missed him and I think the sport missed
him."</TE>
<TE>   Next up for the two will be the Summer Nationals next month in
Florida. Peirsol, asked for a prediction about that race, would say
only, "There's going to be some fast swimming going on there."</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Jason Lezak of Irvine swam a meet-record 49.84 in
winning the men's 100 freestyle. World-record holder Michael Phelps,
17, won the 200 butterfly in 1:56.51. Lindsay Benko won the women's
100 freestyle in 55.59 and the 400 freestyle in 4:10.60</TE>

<LD>Videotaped violence against 16-year-old Donovan Jackson on July 6
produced a wave of community protest and now the indictments of two
officers of the Inglewood Police Department. Local political leaders
and national figures--Dick Gregory, Martin Luther King III and Al
Sharpton, among other--have marched in protest. Two people who work
or live in Inglewood spoke with MARY REESE BOYKIN about the incident
and the indictments.</LD>

<TE>   I feel pleased that, finally, somebody caught them on videotape.
It is good that two of the officers were indicted; they got what they
deserved. Now, at least in Inglewood, cops won't act as crazy as they
did before.</TE>
<TE>   For 2 1/2 months, my friends and I have been upset with our
treatment by officers of the Inglewood Police Department. In our
encounter, I got off work, wearing a white shirt and tie. I went to
my friend's house in an area of Inglewood known for gang activity.
Four of us were standing in front of the house as I checked out my
friend's automobile, which was not running well.</TE>
<TE>   The police drove up, four officers at first and then another two.
They told us to put our hands up. They searched us. At their command,
we spread our legs. But they told us to spread wider and wider. They
acted as if we were putting up a fight; they tried to aggravate us to
start something.</TE>
<TE>   They pushed us against the car. Then an officer asked, "Are you
gang-related?" We all said no. They took pictures of us for their
gang file anyway.</TE>
<TE>   We asked, "Why are you putting us in the gang file if we are not
gang members?" An officer answered, "Don't worry about it."</TE>
<TE>   I felt violated. I don't think that people should be treated that
way. I am 22. I have a wife and three daughters. I just work and take
care of my own.</TE>
<TE>   A community response needs to happen.</TE>

<TE>   Enterprise Society</TE>
<TE>   Once the teenager was handcuffed, the force was supposed to stop.
But there is a big difference between this beating and that of Rodney
King. Inglewood's police, investigators and the district attorney's
office have moved quickly. Even the L.A. County Grand Jury has
indicted two officers. We must have some patience. We need to show
respect for our local political leaders, many of whom always are
fighting for the community. Young activists need to show respect for
these leaders instead of name-calling or pointing fingers.</TE>
<TE>   We had outsiders coming here, saying what we need to do. Let them
take care of their own homes. At the rallies, many of them are
getting into Inglewood's business. They don't know how to get to the
Inglewood City Hall without directions.</TE>
<TE>   I work with ex-gang members in Los Angeles County, including
Inglewood. A sentiment many of them express is that outsiders don't
come here unless there are television cameras.</TE>
<TE>   In all of this, we must deal with the problems that constantly
plague our community. We must address the drive-by shootings, the
lack of jobs, the need for educating our children. And there is
something we can learn from gang members: unite and communicate.
Simply talking to the television cameras won't get the job done.</TE>

<DH>Corrupt firms have coasted as employees sank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN ZIEGLER-DAVENPORT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a former Dilbertina in corporate America, it seems to me that
something important is missing in the current efforts to diagnose and
treat a very bad case of corruption. The malady is not limited to "a
few bad apples," nor will it yield to new regulations, important as
they are.</LD>
<LD>   The infection is systemic, reflecting a 20-year change in
corporate culture that converted full-time employees to temporary
workers, all but eliminated corporate investment in communities and
gutted strong companies to "maximize shareholder value." The
resulting, and temporary, increases in stock prices and reductions in
operating costs (at the expense of employees) fueled an obscene rise
in executive salaries.</LD>
<LD>   Employees and communities were the immediate losers in the new
corporations. Now we see that shareholders can also lose.</LD>
<TE>   Employees once were valued members of a corporate family. They
worked an eight-hour day and were paid a fair salary that included a
company-paid pension plan and decent medical-dental insurance. They
may also have had a 401(k), or one of its predecessors, but this was
not a replacement for a traditional pension. In return, most
employees willingly gave their best efforts and loyalty. Shareholders
received a regular return on investment in the form of dividends.
They didn't have to sell their stock for immediate return and could
endure the normal ups and downs of the business cycle, knowing that
good companies invested for the future. Both employees and investors
were usually in for the long term.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in the mid-1980s, "paternalism" gave way to
"entrepreneurship." Of course, corporate managers bear no
relationship to true entrepreneurs. But the illusion led many to
believe they deserved to live like robber barons and kings. Companies
that once referred to employees as "part of the family" became "lean
and mean" places of temporary employment, with employees hired and
fired as needed. This was sold to employees as "taking charge of
one's career." Divisions were sold off, producing instant revenue and
juicing up executive compensation.</TE>
<TE>   It is no wonder that today's corporations do not value "older"
workers. They know too much. Attention, young people: In the 1930s,
people died to establish the eight-hour workday, and until recent
years it was the norm. There is something wrong when today's children
are fed packaged dinners by a nanny and parents eat remnants while
standing over the sink at 10 p.m. Employers know this.</TE>
<TE>   It was possible to overlook the loss of personal time and such
hard-won benefits as company-paid pensions and medical care when it
seemed we were all going to be rich. Now that that's over, perhaps we
can rebuild our work environment into something fair.</TE>
<TE>   Dethroning the CEO is a beginning. Prior to the 1990s,
extraordinary wealth was the realm of the true entrepreneur--Edison,
Ford, Gates, Disney and others who, warts and all, created something
of value. Many of today's CEOs created nothing; at best they managed
well what they inherited.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses should start again to reinvest in employees and the
community. This was once touted as being good for business and for
shareholders. It still is.</TE>
<TE>   Accountants and economists can start speaking in plain language.
Congress can establish independent governing boards and enact
effective regulations. But without a change of values, greed and
fraud will simply take a different form.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Ziegler-Davenport, who now works at Southwestern
University School of Law, was a corporate employee for 17 years.</TE>

<HD>Provocative Essays Reflect Diversity of Images and
Assessments of Islam</HD>
<DH>INSIDE ISLAM: The Faith, The People, and the Conflicts of
the World's Fastest-Growing Religion  Edited by John Miller  and
Aaron Kenedi  Marlowe &amp; Co.: paperback  264 pages, $15.95</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a few months after Sept. 11, Americans were eager for information
about the non-Western world, much as they had been spurred to greater
international awareness by the Cold War. Books, newspaper stories,
magazine articles and television shows reflected this surge in
interest.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, almost as quickly as it crested, public curiosity seems to
have receded--supplanted by the furor over the economy and the
misdeeds of corporate America and the anticipation of midterm
congressional elections.</LD>
<LD>   "Inside Islam," edited by John Miller and Aaron Kenedi, is a
compilation of essays on Islam, some of which were written just after
Sept. 11, and reminds us how vital it is for Americans to have a
greater understanding of the international environment.</LD>
<TE>   The collection is a good introduction not just to the variety of
religious experience in the Muslim world, but also to the political
dynamics that help fuel fundamentalist hatred of the West in general
and of the United States above all.</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans believe that Islam is, at base, a violent faith.
After all, there are only a few million Muslims in the United States;
most people don't know any Muslims; and the only images they see are
of bearded criminals accused of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Dispelling that myth, Thomas Cleary, in an essay about the Koran,
writes that "Islam does not demand unreasoned belief.... [The]
connection between faith and reason enabled Islamic civilization to
absorb and vivify useful knowledge ... whereby it eventually nursed
Europe out of the Dark Ages."</TE>
<TE>   The same culture that nursed Osama bin Laden also embraced science
and learning while Europe was mired in superstition, and had it not
been for Muslim translations of the works of the ancient Greeks, the
Renaissance as we know it may never have happened.</TE>
<TE>   Other essays show the variety of religious and cultural experience
in the Muslim world, which stretches from Morocco to Indonesia and
includes more than 1 billion believers.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Wolfe, an American convert to Islam, writes beautifully of
his pilgrimage to Mecca as "an act of love," while Huston Smith (in
an essay written in the 1950s) says simply that "Islam unrolls before
us one of the most remarkable panoramas in all history." Geneive Abdo
describes the Islamic revival in contemporary Egypt as a moderate,
quietist crusade for social justice, more like the progressive
Christian reformers of early 20th century America than the thuggish,
ignorant Taliban so deliciously skewered in William T. Vollmann's
travelogue of his time in Afghanistan in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And in a related vein, Geraldine Brooks writes of her mixed
emotions about the place of women in Muslim societies, as she
celebrates the unique privacy and intimacy of women's lives and
mourns the inequities and the indignities of life behind the veil.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, as Fareed Zakaria reminds us, as a result of the utter
political failure of Arab regimes, in many places "the rich,
colorful, pluralistic, and easygoing Islam ... has turned into a
dour, puritanical faith, policed by petty theocrats and religious
commissars." The most provocative essays analyze what Bernard Lewis
controversially called "the roots of Muslim rage."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is one of the most eminent scholars of Islam, and in a 1990
essay, he argued that there is a bona fide "clash of civilizations"
between Islam and the West, at least insofar as radical
fundamentalists see the West as a cultural and religious threat.</TE>
<TE>   That argument was also put forward by Harvard political scientist
Samuel Huntington, and in spite of the claims of the Bush
administration that the adversary is terrorism and not Islam, there
is a widespread feeling that the enemy is, in fact, Islam.</TE>
<TE>   That is a dangerous, and potentially self-fulfilling, analysis,
and it gives terrorist groups exactly the legitimacy they crave.</TE>
<TE>   Groups such as Al Qaeda can justify themselves only on the premise
of a war between religions and between civilizations; take that away,
and they are nothing but murderous conspirators with a hollow
ideology.</TE>
<TE>   If we treat them as criminals and rogues, and recognize that they
no more speak for Islam than white supremacists or Timothy McVeigh
speak for Christianity, we deny them a potent weapon.</TE>
<TE>   But if we mistakenly treat them as representative of a billion
Muslims, we shouldn't be surprised if a considerable portion of those
billion lean toward them and turn against us in righteous
indignation.</TE>

<LD>The National Park Service is restoring half a mile of steep and very
popular trail on the shoulder of Half Dome, the brooding icon of
Yosemite National Park, a project detailed in a story and photos in
The Times this week. Now here's a story behind the story: The
$121,000 for the work comes not from National Park Service taxpayer
funds but from private contributions collected by the Yosemite Fund,
a volunteer organization.</LD>
<LD>   The Yosemite Fund also is paying for a substantial part of a
$12.5-million rehabilitation of the Lower Yosemite Falls trail. As
much as everyone should be grateful to the Yosemite Fund, the very
fact that the Park Service needs to turn to such groups for such
basic financial help is a national shame. Presidents and
congressional leaders point to the parks as the crown jewels of the
nation's natural, cultural and historical heritage. But the jewels
are tarnished.</LD>
<TE>   The nation's leaders have been quick to establish new units in the
park system, such as the Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front
National Historic Park in Richmond, Calif. It's a noble sort of
pork-barrel politics. But the growth deprives the National Park
Service of operations and maintenance funds. As the backlog of needed
work has piled up, a coalition of 200 groups under the leadership of
the National Parks and Conservation Assn. has formed its own lobbying
group, Americans for National Parks, to demand more logical funding
for the park system.</TE>
<TE>   The group contends in a letter to President Bush that the Park
Service budget has not kept pace with increased visitation. The parks
suffer from air and water pollution, degradation of historic
buildings and the decline of wildlife. Though Congress proposes to
boost park spending by $91 million over last year, the coalition says
the parks still will be $600 million short of what is needed. Getting
half that would be a big help in tough times.</TE>
<TE>   Presidents pledge to spend billions on parks, but mostly this
money goes for roads, water and sewer plants and other
bricks-and-mortar projects. Programs to preserve and restore the
environment, to educate park visitors and conduct scientific studies
remain starved.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of neglect is everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Death Valley National Park has a single hydrologist to monitor and
safeguard the park's water rights. Grand Canyon National Park, one of
the world's geologic marvels, does not have a single geologist on its
staff. Only 5% of Lassen Volcanic National Park has been surveyed for
archeological resources. There is a two-year waiting list for local
schools to participate in educational programs at Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   The list goes on. The national heritage is being loved to death,
neglected to death, because there is no publicity to be had from
shoring up the maintenance budget.</TE>

<LD>There you are, just about to ease back in your La-Z-Boy and enjoy
your Saturday reading. The phone rings. It's a mortgage officer who
purchased your financial records and home phone number from a bank,
deemed you a good credit risk and decided to try to sell you his new
refinancing plan. Grrr.</LD>
<LD>   A consumer privacy bill awaiting action in the state Assembly
would make it much tougher for companies to intrude on precious
weekends.</LD>
<LD>   That legislation, Senate Bill 773, by Sen. Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough), had been considered dead for the year largely
because Gov. Gray Davis had not committed to supporting it.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, however, the bill gained momentum July 5 when Chris
Larsen, chief executive of the online lender E-Loan and a competitor
of traditional banks, donated $1 million to help get a financial
privacy protection initiative on the California ballot next year.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen--who believes that consumer confidence in privacy
protection is essential to the vitality of online financial
services--vows to put the measure on the ballot as early as next year
unless Sacramento legislators, who have dawdled over passing privacy
protections in the last three years, open their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law allows banks and other financial companies to sell
personal information without getting an individual's permission. It
does give customers the right to "opt out": to e-mail, phone or fax a
company and ask it not to share your personal information with or
sell it to third parties.</TE>
<TE>   What SB 773 would do is mandate an "opt in" system that requires
companies to obtain your permission before they share or sell it. To
address corporate concerns, the bill was recently amended to allow
banks to share some information with businesses in their corporate
family.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, SB 773 died on the Assembly floor because legislators
waffled in their support for it. This year, SB 773, having recently
passed the full Senate, is again awaiting a vote on the full Assembly
floor.</TE>
<TE>   To make that happen, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City)
would need to schedule the bill for reconsideration, legislators
would have to get behind it and Davis, who has been backing a
squishy, industry-friendly "alternative" measure, would need to
commit to signing it.</TE>
<TE>   By supporting Speier's moderate but strong privacy protections
now, state leaders can sensibly balance corporate concerns with
something they have ignored far too long: the simmering frustration
of Californians who see their privacy steadily chipped away.</TE>
<TE>   To Take Action: Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson, phone, (916)
319-2047;  fax, (916) 319-2147;  e-mail, speaker@assembly.ca.gov.
Gov. Gray Davis, phone, (916) 445-2841; fax, (916) 445-4633; e-mail,
governor@ governor.ca.gov.</TE>

<HD>Finally Cleaning Up Its Act</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District finally has decided to live up
to its name. After years of arguing "not needed" and "can't afford
it," it voted Wednesday to clean up millions of gallons of human
waste pumped into ocean waters off Huntington Beach. The county can
at last rid itself of an unattractive distinction: Its release into
the Pacific was dirtier than the outflows from nearly all of the
nation's 16,000 other sewer agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The unexpected move, driven by pressure from environmentalists and
frustrated beachfront cities, means the agency will abandon plans to
renew a federal waiver that allows the dumping of 120 million gallons
a day of partially treated sewage four miles offshore.</LD>
<LD>   Constructing facilities to cleanse the sewage more thoroughly will
take more than a decade and cost up to $270 million, or an average of
$16 a year per household. It will be time and money well spent.</LD>
<TE>   No one knows whether the plume of sewage released into the ocean
was the cause of the mysterious pollution that led to a series of
beach closures at Huntington Beach. Studies were inconclusive. But
the sanitation district, after years of saying that the sewage
remained miles offshore, finally admitted this year that the waste
could move to within a half-mile of county beaches.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, the waiver drew little public attention because
people found sewage about as boring a topic as you could name,
associated with such bureaucratic jargon as "aging infrastructure"
and "deferred maintenance." Not until it was linked to more
understandable phrases--"bacteria and viruses in the ocean" and
"beach closure"--did the move to end the waiver gain popularity.</TE>
<TE>   It's an important message for public leaders as the work of
producing a cleaner ocean begins. A member of the sanitation agency's
board correctly noted that sewage treatment alone won't stop beach
closures and pollution postings. The main causes are sewer line
spills, caused by grease plugs and crumbling pipes, and urban
runoff--that hideous mix of car oil, pesticides and other toxins that
washes off lawns and streets and through storm drains to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Now that water quality agencies are imposing strict rules on urban
runoff, city officials in most of Southern California already are
talking of "not needed" and "too expensive."</TE>
<TE>   The ocean is not an infinite resource, able to take everything we
flush into it and remain a source of food, beauty, wildlife and
recreation. Southern California's leaders should lead, taking
aggressive and sometimes costly steps to stop polluting the ocean and
beach instead of waiting for public outcry to force a cleanup.</TE>

<LD>Re "Defense Seeking Greater Latitude," July 15: The Bush
administration's efforts to eliminate or bypass congressional
oversight of many of the Department of Defense's activities should be
seen for what it is: a shocking power grab that if accomplished by
force would be considered a coup d'etat. It is no less dangerous
because it is being attempted quietly by gray bureaucrats wearing
gray business suits. In fact, these nonelected officials (including
the president) are on the verge of imposing a form of government
radically different from the one the framers of the Constitution
envisioned.</LD>
<LD>   According to your article, they even admit engaging in "a larger
administrationwide effort to fundamentally alter the relationship
between executive branch agencies and Congress"; in other words, to
single-handedly rewrite (or trash) the Constitution. Unfortunately
for them, doing so constitutes subversion, possibly even treason. All
of the patriotic rhetoric in the world, and all of the
rationalizations based on the boogeyman of "terrorism," can't mask
that simple fact.</LD>
<TE>   Constitutional checks and balances, such as congressional
oversight of the executive branch, exist for a reason. In fact, they
exist precisely to prevent rogue politicians, such as Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his cronies in the Bush administration
(including the president), from becoming laws unto themselves. Rather
than acceding to Rumsfeld's demands, Congress must exert its
constitutional prerogatives and retain full oversight of Defense and
other federal agencies. Indeed, in light of the fact that Congress is
the only branch of the government that is constitutionally authorized
to declare war, Congress should increase its scrutiny of Defense
during this so-called "war on terrorism" rather than abdicating its
responsibilities and allowing the Pentagon free rein.</TE>

<TE>   Last week, our military establishment demanded and got, for its
soldiers and generals, immunity from criminal prosecution in the
International Criminal Court ("U.S. Granted Immunity for
Peacekeepers," July 13). This week officials are asking for immunity
from many congressional oversights. I see these moves as leading to
an absolute power that is certain to corrupt. Worse, the civilian
authority residing in the president is rewarding every step.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for your July 15 article and pictures on the present state
of affairs regarding the Half Dome climb in Yosemite National Park. I
have never seen a better view of the back of Half Dome and the cable
ladder. I was very surprised to read of the high volume of hikers
these days.</LD>
<LD>   My first visit to the park was in the early summer of 1932, when
park visits were limited to two or three weeks to prevent campers
from staying all summer. There were no specific campsites; you set up
your tent, or whatever, where it was convenient. The only rule given
by the park ranger was "No nails in the trees."</LD>
<LD>   The following year my dad, brother and I set out to climb Half
Dome, first hiking to the top of the Upper Yosemite Falls as a warmup
two days prior. We left Happy Isles about 7:30 a.m., went up the mist
trail and from there on encountered no one on the trail all the way
to the top of the Dome. Outside of scaling the Dome, the toughest
part of the hike was going up the shale trail on the left approach to
the top of Vernal Falls. Once on top we did see three or four other
people, but they were to our left on the slightly lower elevation. As
I recall, the scariest part of the trip was starting down the cable
near the top. It appeared that we would walk right off the face of
the Earth. I was 10 years old at the time and will never forget the
thrill of that climb.</LD>

<LD>I am one of many small-business owners who take umbrage at big
business (and its mouthpiece, the Chambers of Commerce) for
disparaging state Sen. Sheila Kuehl's (D-Santa Monica) paid family
leave bill as another burden on the back of California business
(Voices, July 13). Senate Bill 1661 would actually save businesses
money and taxes by reducing dependence on government-supported home
health care, transportation and emergency services; structured leaves
would reduce tardiness and absenteeism; productivity would increase
because workers would not be affected by worrying about a loved one.</LD>
<LD>   A secondary effect would be that an ill loved one would recover
faster and return to work. All of these reasons will also strengthen
employee loyalty. As a small-business owner, I have no problem paying
extra disability taxes. I count these toward the dues I pay to
operate in the fifth-largest economy in the world. California's
educated and highly trained work force, its staggering variety of
products and services and its voracious but knowledgeable consumers
are strong reasons for enacting Kuehl's SB 1661.</LD>

<LD>As a direct result of Sept. 11, former New York City Mayor Rudolph

a year. The average per capita income in Afghanistan is about $200.

<LD>My comment about "giving up" is the beginning, not the end, of what's
happening at Fremont High School ("A School Flails in a Sea of
Chaos," July 14). Teachers have not given up on our students or the
school, only on the possibility of real reform coming out of the
LAUSD or the state auditing process. Although our students often lack
the skills to fully express their ideas in standard academic English,
we know they are intelligent, sensitive and capable of higher-level
thinking. We are often moved by their thoughtfulness, creativity and
insight, in spite of the terrible toll taken in day-to-day ways by
violence, poverty and racism.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, their standardized test scores are very low, and it is vital
they improve them, not as an end in itself but as a means to their
own empowerment, so they become responsible, active members of
society. Remember, we are the ones who applauded when promised
"broad, systemic change." Our mistake was naively believing that the
district and the state were truly committed to that process. Instead,
our students are in a very real sense the prisoners of an inequitable
educational system and the society that has allowed it to thrive.
They attend a school at which most of the problems are directly
related to the conflict between meeting the very real needs of
teachers, counselors and students and the overcrowding and
underfunding that have distorted education on this campus.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who arrive passionate about their subjects are worn down
by bad management and made to feel powerless by a bureaucracy that
rewards compliance over creativity. We hoped that the auditing team
would have the power--and the courage--to make real changes, not
merely the appearance of change.</TE>
<TE>   I will never give up on my students, on their ability to create
and to learn or on their right to an equitable education. They
inspire me, they amaze me, they have kept me coming back for 20
years.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seventy percent of Fremont's 4,600 students don't understand what
they read? That's not the failure of Fremont itself; that is the
failure of a school system that refuses to do anything about social
promotion. The LAUSD gave lip service to ending social promotion for
a year, then dropped it completely.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as in past years, a student can fail every class from first
through eighth grades yet still be admitted as a freshman in high
school. And since the district does not allow any remedial classes in
high schools, you have students woefully unprepared for the classes
they must take to graduate. No wonder two-thirds of Fremont's
students drop out.</TE>
<TE>   Had the LAUSD chosen to fix lower grades first and require
proficiency of students before advancement, Fremont and all other
high schools would fix themselves. Instead, the top administrators,
led by an ex-governor with no knowledge of educational problems, try
to fix everything backward: start at the high school and move down.</TE>

<TE>   What a disgrace. L.A. Unified is one of the biggest school
districts in the richest state in the richest country in the world,
and it can't educate its students? Surely there is an optimum size
for a school district--and over 700,000 students can't be it. Break
it up! And then hold those administrators' feet to the fire until
they make it work.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Why Investigation of Bush's Stock Sale 'Just Didn't Pan Out,' "
July 14: If this analysis is true, then insider trading laws are a
big scam. True insiders, like President Bush, need only have their
high-priced corporate attorneys structure the "insider" deal so that
it is legal. The real purpose of insider trading laws is, therefore,
to keep us, the great unwashed, from participating in the rich man's
game.</LD>
<LD>   If confidence in the market is to be restored, we need new,
tougher laws and regulations on the stock market. I'm certainly not
going to put any more of my hard-earned money in a market rigged to
funnel my retirement funds into the pockets of already-wealthy
insiders, even if one of them is my president.</LD>

<TE>   Ronald Brownstein has ostensibly joined the cacophonous chorus of
those political opportunists who are singing what they believe will
be Bush's swan song ("Bush's Troublesome Week May Be Just the
Beginning," news analysis, July 13). But the state of our nation and
the state of Bush's presidency are strong. Does anybody have the
temerity to suggest that the vox populi will be shocked over a few
alleged business compromises that desperate Democrats have dug up on
Bush--even after President Clinton forever lowered the bar on the
public's expectations for presidential moral fortitude while raising
the public's threshold for all that smacks of a scandal?</TE>
<TE>   Are recent disclosures about Bush's past the beginning of the end
for Bush? Is this the lurking nemesis that Democrats have been pining
for? Are we hearing Bush's swan song? It ain't over until the intern
sings.</TE>

<TE>   Charlotte Allen (Opinion, July 14) does her best to lay the blame
for the nose dive in public confidence suffered by the corporate
community on the Clinton administration, saying, in effect, that no
one complained when times were good. Her solution is "a stringent
network of criminal sanctions and enforcement mechanisms and a
culture in U.S. business that rewards the honorable."</TE>
<TE>   Who will perform those admirable tasks? The Bush administration?
The same ones who have attempted to dismantle any and all controls
over the right of businesses to get whatever they want in any way
they can? The ones who defended, in the name of a free market,
Enron's right to hold the citizens of California hostage? Will the
people who have done everything possible to turn over public lands
for private profit suddenly create a culture of rewarding the
honorable?</TE>
<TE>   It's true, profits drive our economy and, if the market isn't
skewed, some leftovers trickle down to fuel our enviable lifestyle.
But when the locks are taken off the henhouse and the door is opened
wide, who can blame the foxes for cleaning up? Foxes know no honor,
only dinner.</TE>

<TE>   George H.W. Bush was blamed for the recession because he allowed
deficits to grow, which increased interest rates and killed the
economy. George W. Bush is linked to our current corporate meltdown
because he received the sort of loans that he now speaks out against,
he failed to report a stock sale as required by law and then changed
his story about why he failed to report it, and he took money from
Enron and then allowed it to make energy policy for his
administration. In addition, George W.'s tax cuts for the wealthy
have caused a deficit that will lead to higher interest rates and
once again cripple the economy. When it comes to the economy, Bush
Sr. just didn't get it, and Bush Jr. is showing no signs of
understanding it any better.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I think Allen is right to say that Bush is not to blame for what
the CEOs of Enron, WorldCom, etc., did. At the same time, she is also
wrong to blame Clinton. The big supporters of deregulation were the
members of both parties who were anxious to please their corporate
contributors for the sake of big money for getting reelected. Ms.
Allen, it was the CEOs who cooked the books and walked away with
hundreds of millions of dollars. Don't blame the investors for trying
to make 10% on their money, as if that was greedy.</TE>

<TE>   My thanks to John Balzar (Commentary, July 14) for cutting through
the obfuscation of those omnipresent, well-compensated spin doctors.
The raison d'etre for an endless, multimillion-dollar rage against
the sexual excesses (and perjury) of Clinton was the belief that our
national executives should be held to a higher moral standard. That
argument has now conveniently been cast aside by Dubya and his
handlers, and we are being asked to wink at Bush, Cheney, Army
Secretary Thomas White and others for multimillions of dollars in
blatant greed, improper corporate influence, fiduciary malfeasance
and stock market manipulation. Where is a special prosecutor when we
truly need one?</TE>

<HD>City Council Blocks Measure on Boroughs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Borough Measure for Ballot Rejected," July 17: I have felt for
years that there needs to be much more local control of zoning and
other budgetary issues in the city of Los Angeles. This is why I have
long been a strong supporter of Valley secession. Only recently have
I reconsidered the idea of secession, as some of the wiser City
Council members have started discussing a borough plan.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhood councils are powerless to make change. If modeled
after New York's borough system, the council members could have found
jobs as mayors of their respective boroughs. Now they will be lucky
if Valley residents support them in their likely bids to be council
members or mayor of a new Valley city.</LD>
<LD>   It is a shame, but as it now stands after the City Council vote,
residents who seek more local control are left with no alternatives
to secession. Only the City Council itself can be blamed for allowing
the San Fernando Valley to secede from Los Angeles.</LD>

<TE>   Valley secessionist David Fleming assures us that the San Fernando
Valley's poor, overwhelmingly residing in the northeast section, can
only benefit from a brave new city spun off from old, stodgy,
unresponsive Los Angeles (Opinion, July 14). He assures us that "a
lot of people who live in the hills are more concerned about the
poor"--presumably meaning more concerned about them than are the
present city government and Los Angeles' general population.</TE>
<TE>   Snake oil is snake oil, whether the salesman believes in it or
not. If the Valley splits from Los Angeles, poor residents of the new
city will certainly enjoy higher taxes, but they will suffer the same
neglect. Better to force more responsiveness to the Valley's poor
from our current, unimaginative city government than to weaken their
voice even more by giving Valley fat cats power to run the whole
show.</TE>

<TE>   Some Valley secessionists would have us believe that an
independent Valley would be like Burbank. I've lived in Burbank and
remarked at the time that the streets were in a much better state of
repair than adjacent streets in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But the Valley is far too large and has much too much poverty to
ever be like Burbank, whether independent or not. And the money we
would hope to devote to fixing up our streets would be swallowed up
by lawyers in the years of litigation that would follow secession.</TE>

<HD>L.A.'s Sewer System and Closure of Beaches</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Sharing the Beach With Pollution," Commentary, July 4: The
primary cause of beach closures in L.A. County is not from sewer
spills from the city of Los Angeles but rather from sewer spills from
other cities or from storm water runoff. The majority of the spills
reported in the column were minimal and did not reach the beaches or
rivers. The sewer overflows are mainly the result of grease blockages
or root intrusion in the sewer system, and we regularly service the
system to minimize these problems.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles' sewer system is one of the largest in the nation and
has a considerably lower number of spills compared with other systems
nationwide, or even statewide. The city has adopted an aggressive
sewer maintenance and condition assessment stance and already has
implemented a number of programs to reduce the overflows to comply
with new proposed federal regulations.</LD>
<LD>   In its commitment to protecting the environment, the city has
spent $2 billion in upgrades to the Hyperion Treatment Plant and an
additional $1 billion in sewer improvements over the last 10 years
and plans to spend $2 billion over the next 10 years.</LD>

<LD>Kenneth Green is worried about commandeering consumer choice
(Commentary, July 5). Assemblywoman Fran Pavley's (D-Agoura Hills)
bill, AB 1058, is concerned about regulating tailpipe emissions of
greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Green says that
climate change is "largely theoretical." Does that mean we shouldn't
be concerned?</LD>
<LD>   The United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change predicted that the Earth's average temperature could rise by
as much as 10.4 degrees in this century. The last decade was the
warmest on record for the last 140 years. Burning fossil fuels
contributes to the problem. When some consumers insist on driving
behemoth vehicles that burn two to three times as much gas as other
cars, regulation is in order. These shortsighted people aren't just
hurting themselves by exercising consumer choice. I hope Gov. Gray
Davis signs this bill.</LD>

<HD>Yemeni Admits Lying to a U.S. Immigration Officer</HD>
<DH>Courts: Guilty plea leaves unresolved allegations of ties
to 9/11, which lawyer says were never proved.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A Yemeni man who authorities say may have helped some of the Sept. 11
hijackers pleaded guilty Friday to lying to a federal immigration
officer.</LD>
<LD>   Mohdar Abdullah, a former student at San Diego State, has been in
federal custody since shortly after the attacks. He will be given
credit for time served at sentencing Oct. 8, and will probably be
deported to Yemen, said his lawyer, Kerry Steigerwalt.</LD>
<LD>   Abdullah, 24, was charged with filing an asylum application in May
2000 in which he allegedly made the false claim that he was from
Somalia and was a member of a minority group facing persecution
there.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, he acknowledged that he had lied to an immigration
officer. Abdullah, whose given name is Al-Mohdar Mohamed Al-Mohdar
Zeid, told the officer he had entered the United States on Dec. 7,
1998, in New York on an Italian passport.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, he entered three days later from Canada on a Yemeni
passport.</TE>
<TE>   The plea did not address allegations that have been made in court
documents. Investigators said they suspected that Abdullah knowingly
helped three Sept. 11 hijackers who lived in San Diego in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah allegedly told the hijackers how to get Social Security
cards and California driver's licenses. He also telephoned a flight
school in Florida to arrange for flight lessons and "regularly dined,
worked and prayed with the hijackers," prosecutors asserted.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah remained illegally in the United States "in order to help
the ... hijackers and/or any future hijackers in the furtherance of
terrorist activities against people in the United States," FBI Agent
Daniel Gonzalez said in a seven-page statement filed in May.</TE>
<TE>   Steigerwalt, however, said the allegations against his client were
never substantiated. "I guess I can just say that if it were true, I
would have seen some criminal charges along those lines," he said.</TE>

<HD>Arsonist Who Torched Man Sentenced to Life</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 23-year-old man with a fascination for fire was sentenced Friday to
life in prison for pouring paint thinner on a man while he slept
outside a San Fernando convenience store and igniting it.</LD>
<LD>   In late January, a jury ruled that Jose Manuel Carranza of Sylmar,
a high school dropout who had no prior criminal record and may have
been responsible for as many as 50 fires through the years, was sane
when he attacked and torched Luciano Olmeda, 45, of Lincoln Heights.
Carranza was convicted of murder and arson on Feb. 20, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Carranza's attorney, Dale Rubin, who filed an appeal just after
the sentencing, said his client should be in a mental institution for
the rest of his life, not in prison.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very emotional case," Rubin said. "Here we have a young
boy who never had a criminal record and needed additional help with
his mental condition. He's not going to get that help in prison."</TE>
<TE>   About 20 relatives and friends of Carranza sat in the courtroom,
many sobbing when Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor spoke about
Carranza and the May 18, 1997, crime.</TE>
<TE>   Olmeda was drunk and unconscious outside a 7-Eleven store when
Carranza, 18 at the time, attacked him.</TE>
<TE>   Carranza kicked him in the face, breaking his jaw and causing
bleeding of the brain, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Taklender said.</TE>
<TE>   Carranza then poured paint thinner in Olmeda's lap and set him on
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Olmeda suffered third-degree burns over half his body and died
later that day.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the attack, Carranza started two trash-can fires and
burned the front doors of churches in San Fernando and Pacoima,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin argued that Carranza was insane at the time of the crime and
has had "a fascination for fire" ever since a childhood head injury.</TE>
<TE>   "He should have been treated for his condition when he was young,"
Rubin said. "If he would have, we may not be here now."</TE>

<HD>Lots of Sugar, Plus Magic</HD>
<DH>Confections: Big Sky Concessions brings cotton candy, the
quintessential fair food, to Costa Mesa. It's made on-site and served
on a paper cone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the scent of melting caramel and butter mingling in the air,
Brit Barnes stood over a vat, wrapping web upon web of a bubblegum
flavored confection onto a cone.</LD>
<LD>   Within five minutes, the veteran confectioner had twirled and hung
six bags of pink, blue and purple cotton candy from the ceiling of
the family's narrow trailer, tucked into the food court of the Orange
County Fairgrounds.</LD>
<LD>   "Timing is important and it can be a mess," Barnes, 20, said as he
wiped sticky threads of spun sweetness from his hands and apron. "I'm
covered in sugar all day long."</LD>
<TE>   Barnes, who has been making the quintessential fair food each
summer since he was 5, is part of a 30-year family tradition of
selling treats such as candy apples, popcorn and snow cones at county
fairs. The Barnes' Big Sky Concessions has three colorfully designed
20-foot trailers parked at this year's fair in Costa Mesa, which runs
through July 28. They'll travel to at least three more county fairs
before summer's end.</TE>
<TE>   These days, most cotton candy purveyors sell pre-made products
sealed in plastic bags. The Barnes family prefers to whip it up
on-site and serve it on a white paper cone--which fascinates
fairgoers young and old.</TE>
<TE>   "Little kids come up to us with their parents and say, 'Mom, how
does that happen?' " said Barnes' mother, Judy. "We just tell them
it's magic."</TE>
<TE>   Magic or not, the art of cotton candy making still requires a
little help from science.</TE>
<TE>   A mixture of sugar and powdered food coloring called flossine is
poured into a centrifuge. As an electric current melts the sugar, the
center chamber slings it into tiny holes in the machine's circular
vat, where it eventually turns into the thread-like froth.</TE>
<TE>   The candy concoction, first called Fairy Floss, was introduced to
the public at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, where it sold for
pennies.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Satariano of Long Beach asked for cotton candy on a stick
for her 4-year-old son, Jack.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it's more fun on a stick," Satariano said as she
handed a puffy pink cloud of sugar to her son.</TE>
<TE>   "I like cotton candy the best," said Jack, his smile wide as he
swiped sugar from his face. "It tastes good."</TE>
<TE>   Others prefer the bagged version of the treat, saving some for
later as they stroll through the rides and games at the fair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good," said 10-year-old Leah Heit as she popped a handful of
blueberry-flavored cotton candy into her mouth. "I like the way it
dissolves in your mouth. It's great fair food."</TE>
<TE>   For the Barnes family, cotton candy and the other fair treats
represent more than just good summer business. Over the years, they
have built relationships with Orange County fair vendors and their
families who also travel the same summer circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched our kids work and grow up together," said Judy Barnes,
49, a high school English teacher during the school year in Billings,
Mont. "It has taught our kids responsibility and how to maintain a
strong work ethic."</TE>

hate it ... I guess I've been around cotton candy too long."</CP>

<HD>Charges Dismissed for Robert Downey Jr.</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>A Riverside County judge dismissed drug charges against actor Robert
Downey Jr. on Friday and ended his probation for drug possession at a
Palm Springs resort.</LD>
<LD>   Over the prosecutor's objections, Superior Court Judge Randall
White in Indio found that Downey had stayed sober for more than a
year and should have his probation lifted.</LD>
<LD>   Downey's lawyer, Jim Epstein, said the Academy Award-nominated
actor was "ecstatic" and plans to get back to work as soon as
possible.</LD>
<TE>   Downey, 37, pleaded no contest last year to drug charges after his
arrest at Merv Griffin's Resort Hotel and Givenchy Spa. Under
Proposition 36, a ballot initiative that mandates treatment rather
than jail for many drug offenders, Downey was sentenced to a year at
a live-in drug rehabilitation facility.</TE>
<TE>   Any probation violation could have put him back behind bars for
four years.</TE>
<TE>   Downey also was arrested in 1996, after authorities found cocaine,
heroin and a pistol in his car. He pleaded no contest and was placed
on probation. Three years later, he was sent to Corcoran State Prison
for violating the terms of his probation by failing to submit to drug
tests.</TE>
<TE>   Downey remains on parole in connection with that case. Because of
the parole and the probation, he was unable to get insurance to work
on movies, Epstein said. With the probation now lifted, he should be
insurable, the lawyer added.</TE>
<TE>   Downey also plans to continue speaking to youths about the dangers
of drugs and addiction, the attorney said.</TE>

<HD>Catholics Seek a Voice in Church's Response to Scandals</HD>
<DH>Meeting: Lay members gather to demand greater openness from
leaders and more decision-making power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL EISENBERG</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carol Bongiorno and her husband, Joseph, had planned a Vermont
vacation this month. But the retired couple from Williston Park,
N.Y., recently postponed those plans to join thousands of Roman
Catholics who are gathering in Boston today to take back their
church.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very disappointed in how the hierarchy has handled this
pedophilia scandal," said Carol Bongiorno, 65, a devout Catholic who
sent her four children to Catholic grade schools and who has helped
lead a parish prayer group for 25 years. "I don't want to leave the
church. But now that I know what I know, I have to take
responsibility and do something about it."</LD>
<LD>   Though some Catholics have looked to Rome and to the recent
bishops meeting in Dallas for a panacea to the scandals bedeviling
the church, more than 4,000 of the faithful are headed to a daylong
meeting in the Hynes Convention Center in Boston to chart their own
path by claiming a voice in the church they love.</LD>
<TE>   They are mainstream Catholics for the most part, many of whom like
the Bongiornos are pillars of their parishes. And now, as part of a
fledgling but fast-growing group, Voice of the Faithful, they are
coming together to demand greater openness and accountability from
church leaders, as well as a greater decision-making role for the
laity.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very significant because this is a moderate group at this
point, trying to work with the institutional church, but also
demanding accountability and collaboration," said R. Scott Appleby,
director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism
at the University of Notre Dame. "The people who are participating
are very respectable, very mainstream. These are not extremists or
radicals or people pushing a special cause. They're concerned about
the general lack of accountability of the leadership, and they're
calling their church to higher standards."</TE>
<TE>   Established just five months ago in a church basement in a suburb
of Boston, Voice of the Faithful has caught on across the country in
a climate of disenchantment and distrust among the laity. The group,
whose motto is "Keep the faith, change the church," now claims 19,000
members in 40 states and 21 countries. With mostly word-of-mouth
promotion, organizers say that they expect a sold-out crowd for all
5,000 spots in the Hynes Convention Center, at $20 per ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Today's meeting will be a critical moment for the group. Though
Pope John Paul II spoke about sex abuse in his meeting with the
American cardinals in Rome, and the bishops had their say in Dallas,
"this is the laity's turn," said Jim Post, newly elected president of
Voice of the Faithful and a professor of management at Boston
University. "This is the first opportunity for us to speak in a
national forum since this great scandal broke six months ago."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, too, Catholics of divergent backgrounds --
many of whom signed onto Voice of the Faithful via its Internet site
(www.votf.org)--will come together to discuss how to build a national
framework for the group, as well as developing strategies for change.
At the top of that list is expected to be an alternative fund-raising
mechanism that would enable Catholics to support Catholic charities
while bypassing bishops' appeals.</TE>
<TE>   But the group's challenges are formidable, from maintaining
momentum as the media drumbeat diminishes, to unifying a diverse
membership, to translating the rhetoric of change into reality in a
hierarchical and cleric-driven church.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to say, 'I love the faith, and I'm angry at the
church,' "said David O'Brien, director of the Center for Religion,
Ethics and Culture at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester,
Mass., who will speak today. "It's another thing to make a sustained
effort over a long period of time to bring about change."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those going to Boston say they are ready to roll up their
sleeves and do just that.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a feeling among many cradle Catholics that we're sort of
childlike in our faith," said Melissa Gradel of New York City, 36, a
mother of two who has served on her parish council at St. Boniface
Church and who is one of 10 people from the parish going to the
meeting in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "We let the priests take care of us, and we listen to what they
tell us.... I think that part of the message of the mess we're in now
is that we have to grow up in our faith and act like adults."</TE>

<HD>Woman to Lead Ministry of Lesbian and Gay Catholics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frances M. Ruth, an administrative assistant who has served in the
Ministry of Lesbian and Gay Catholics for the Roman Catholic Church's
Los Angeles archdiocese, has been named to lead the group following
the resignation of Father Peter Liuzzi.</LD>
<LD>   "As a Catholic who happens to be lesbian, this ministry is very
dear to me, and it is my goal to keep it running full throttle," Ruth
wrote in an e-mail announcing her new job. She said Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony continues to fully support the ministry, which has drawn fire
from conservative Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   Ruth, 54, said this week that the ministry--whose budget, like
other departments in the archdiocese, has been cut--is especially
important in view of the sexual abuse scandal that has swept through
the American church.</LD>
<TE>   "In light of the scandal, I see this ministry as one of education,
education, education," Ruth said. "People need to separate words like
pedophilia and ephebophilia [sexual attraction to post-pubescent
youth] from homosexuality. They do not have anything to do with each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Liuzzi, who led the ministry for 10 years and disclosed last year
that he is a celibate gay priest, stepped down several months ago to
take a sabbatical. He said he will not return to the ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Liuzzi wrote a book dealing with his ministry to gay
men and lesbians. That book, "With Listening Hearts," is now under
investigation by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. The book sought to adhere
to Catholic teaching about homosexuality while being pastorally
sensitive to the needs of lesbians and gays. The church teaches that
a homosexual orientation is not itself sinful but that homosexual sex
is.</TE>

<HD>A. Ginzburg, 65; Poet, Soviet Self-Publisher Rallied
Dissidents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexander Ginzburg--persecu- ted and jailed by Soviet authorities for
helping to start the self-publishing movement that inspired
dissidents for decades--died Friday in Paris, according to Russian
news reports. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   A cause of death was not given, but Ginzburg had recently suffered
a bout with lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   He will be buried Monday in the Russian Memorial Cemetery south of
Paris, where many prominent Russians who fled the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution are interred, Russian media reported.</LD>
<TE>   Ginzburg, a poet, launched the literary journal Syntaxis in 1959,
one of the first samizdat, or self-published, journals. The samizdat
papers flourished and moved from hand to hand among members of the
dissident movement as they sought to spread opposition to the
repressive Communist regime.</TE>
<TE>   Only three issues of Syntaxis were released, however. In 1960,
while the 24-year-old Ginzburg was preparing the fourth, the KGB
arrested him and sent him to an Arctic labor camp.</TE>
<TE>   After being released in 1962, he started compiling documents
related to the arrest of prominent dissident Yuli Daniel and fellow
writer Andrei Sinyavsky and published the work underground and abroad
as "The White Book" in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   He was re-arrested a year later and spent five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, he helped author Alexander Solzhenitsyn distribute
royalties from Solzhenitsyn's massive novel about his years in the
Soviet labor camps, "The Gulag Archipelago," to the families of more
than 700 jailed dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Ginzburg was a founding member of the so-called Helsinki
Group, which monitored Soviet compliance with the human-rights
provisions of the Helsinki agreement of 1975.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested again in 1977 and subsequently sentenced to eight
years in a "special regimen" labor camp. But he won his freedom in
1979 in a deal with the U.S. that also freed three other dissidents
in exchange for two convicted Soviet spies.</TE>
<TE>   Although released from prison, Ginzburg was not happy.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not consider myself a liberated man," he told an interviewer
less than a week after leaving his country. "I have not been freed. I
have been banished from my homeland. This is considered punishment in
my country, and it is very painful for me--worse, perhaps, than
prison."</TE>
<TE>   When he testified before a commission of House and Senate members
in Washington a few weeks later, he described the poor conditions
that prisoners endured within the Soviet gulag.</TE>
<TE>   Stomach ulcers, hypertension, and kidney and liver disease were
widespread. Ginzburg himself suffered from ulcers and high blood
pressure, and his tuberculosis was aggravated by his prison work as a
glass polisher forced to breathe air filled with glass powder.</TE>
<TE>   He ultimately chose France as his home in exile. In Paris, he
worked on the emigre newspaper Russian Thought.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Ginzburg, who had appealed repeatedly to the KGB for the
return of the materials that had prompted his first incarceration,
was allowed to view papers related to his 1960 arrest and was given
selected documents from his KGB files by the Federal Security
Service, successor to the KGB.</TE>
<TE>   The papers included manuscripts and copies of Syntaxis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was, for me, a shocking moment," he said. "They had saved
almost everything."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Daniel, a historian and son of Yuli Daniel, called
Ginzburg "the first real independent publisher and free journalist in
Russia."</TE>
<TE>   Natalya Solzhenitsyn, wife of the renowned writer, said Ginzburg
"returned to people the understanding that they could be merciful,
even though all around was this evil and horrible pressure."</TE>

<HD>'Home-Churching' Grows as Option</HD>
<DH>Learning: Leery of relying on organized religion alone,
some parents instill beliefs mostly in the house.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTEN CAMPBELL</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Cooper believes his kids' faith cannot grow by church alone. So
he "home-churches" them.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper, author of "God at the Kitchen Table" (Three Rivers Press,
2002), says parents must take the initiative when it comes to
instilling faith and values in their children.</LD>
<LD>   If you rely strictly on organized religion, he said, "Kids start
to see religion as separate from everyday living."</LD>
<TE>   Every other week or so, Cooper's family worships with a
congregation that's affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, the religious community of Cooper's childhood in
Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the time, the Coopers travel no farther than their
family room to read stories, offer prayers and otherwise worship God.</TE>
<TE>   It started about 10 years ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You realize you need to teach your children some things about
religion and morality," said Cooper, whose children are ages 16, 13
and 10. "If you're not 100% comfortable with organized religion ...
you still need to find a way to pass on your beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said he and his wife started their "home church" by
gathering for prayer and reading from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   Today, such meetings still include prayer and reading--with texts
running the gamut from the Bible to Sports Illustrated. Cooper said
his family typically tries to keep the Sabbath holy by abstaining
from commercial activities such as shopping and going to movies.</TE>
<TE>   "It does take some discipline," he said. "I think it's like most
anything with your children: You need to make a commitment to their
training."</TE>
<TE>   In "God at the Kitchen Table: Teaching Your Religious and Moral
Beliefs to Your Children," Cooper offers dozens of suggestions for
parents interested in creating their own home churches. Though he
thinks it's important to set aside time to discuss religious topics,
Cooper acknowledges that some of the most spiritual conversations may
occur anywhere, any time.</TE>
<TE>   "The most effective things we seem to do are much less formal:
having conversations with our kids around the kitchen table about
God, life and happiness; maintaining mundane family rules that
reinforce basic concepts of right and wrong; asking our kids to
complete chores and other tasks that help them develop internal
[spiritual] discipline; having them help neighbors or friends in
need; and trying to maintain a home environment where they can feel a
sense of emotional support and refuge," Cooper writes.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, as we all end up figuring out while we travel through
this mysterious experience called parenthood, simply loving our
children and providing them with good examples and occasional
firmness are much more critical to their positive development than
any formal religious or moral training."</TE>
<TE>   For Janice Morrow, opportunity came in the form of a passing
ambulance. One day while driving around Mobile, Ala., with her
children, ages 8 and 5, Morrow said she felt moved to pray for a
victim and the people helping him or her in an ambulance as it sped
by. So she and her children said a simple prayer, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, almost every time she and her children see an ambulance, she
said, 5-year-old Mary Catherine pipes up: "Mama, we need to pray."</TE>
<TE>   Some of their petitions are more planned.</TE>
<TE>   Before they leave the house in the morning, Morrow said, she and
her children join together to pray. The kids take turns, she said,
often thanking God for family members--including their dog. During
recent months, Morrow said, her daughter has been praying for the
victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Despina Koulianos, a member of Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church
in Mobile, said she uses prayers to incorporate spirituality into the
daily lives of her two young children.</TE>
<TE>   Such supplications, as well as keeping such Orthodox traditions as
fasting and eating particular foods, help "make God [come] alive in
the routine of our daily lives," Koulianos said.</TE>
<TE>   Meals--particularly those at the beginning of the Sabbath--can
provide instruction and inspiration for Jewish children, said Rabbi
Donald Kunstadt of Mobile's Springhill Avenue Temple.</TE>
<TE>   "Judaism is organized around the Shabbat, and the Shabbat has some
essential home ceremonies which have a great deal of importance,
especially for the children," Kunstadt said.</TE>
<TE>   "Blessing the Sabbath candles, blessing the wine and bread during
the Sabbath meal, grace after the meal--all those traditions, when
they're celebrated by the family, have a lasting impression upon the
children."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Kunstadt said he believes the religious observances that
take place in homes are more important to children than those that
occur in a synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   "They see the deep commitment of the parents to their faith,"
Kunstadt said. "What's done as a community doesn't necessarily show
the same commitment from the parents. It's what you do that matters,
and not what you say. The kids see, through the doing, what the real
commitment is."</TE>
<TE>   Denise Melendez of nearby Daphne said she tries to incorporate
biblical lessons into her three children's activities.</TE>
<TE>   For example, after her 7-year-old daughter learned about the
goodness of God's creation in her Sunday school class at Daphne
United Methodist Church, Melendez planted flowers with her.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody's going to teach your kids something," she said. "It
might as well be us."</TE>

<HD>Caution to Jury Is Ruled Invalid</HD>
<DH>Trials: Judge's warning has called for jurors to report one
another if they refuse to do their duties. Past convictions are not
affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court this week threw out a jury instruction
that permitted judges in criminal trials to admonish jurors to report
other panelists who refused to deliberate or intended to disregard
the law.</LD>
<LD>   In a 4-3 ruling, the court said its disapproval of the 1998 jury
instruction would not affect defendants who already had been
convicted in trials where it had been given.</LD>
<LD>   "It does not infringe upon defendant's federal or state
constitutional right to trial by jury," Chief Justice Ronald M.
George wrote for the court.</LD>
<TE>   But the majority said courts should stop instructing jurors to
police each other because the instruction was vague and could curtail
or harm deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a risk that the instruction will be misunderstood or
that it will be used by one juror as a tool for browbeating other
jurors," George wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike instructions that warn jurors not to visit the scene of a
crime or to read press accounts, the instruction to report other
jurors for refusing to deliberate "focuses on the process of
deliberation itself" and could imperil the secrecy of jury
deliberations, George said.</TE>
<TE>   He said jurors might mistakenly believe that individuals who
disagreed with them were refusing to deliberate or intentionally
disregarding the law.</TE>
<TE>   Justices Marvin Baxter, Ming W. Chin and Janice Rogers Brown
dissented.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter, who wrote the dissent, complained that the court was using
its supervisory power to condemn an instruction because of "a remote
and shadowy risk of harm." He called the instruction "useful and
constitutionally permissible."</TE>
<TE>   The case had been brought by Tye John Engelman, who objected to
the reading of the instruction at his robbery trial in San Diego
County, even though no juror had reported to the judge about a
deliberation problem. Thursday's ruling upheld Engelman's conviction
for robbery and assault.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Peter Quon Jr., who represented the prosecution
in the case, said he thought the instruction was useful, but was
relieved that the ruling would not jeopardize convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The instruction was written by a committee of lawyers and judges
and was not mandatory. Lawyers had the option of requesting it and
judges the authority to give it.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Marie Wesendorf, the defense lawyer in People v. Engelman,
S086462, could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Alan Lomax, 87; Preserved World's Musical Heritage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Lomax, the celebrated folklorist and musicologist whose
collections of thousands of recordings of folk, jazz and blues
musicians since the 1930s helped preserve America's and the world's
heritage, died Friday at a hospital in Safety Harbor, Fla. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was not reported but Lomax suffered two strokes
in 1995. He moved to the Tampa area in 1996 from his longtime home in
New York.</LD>
<LD>   He was the son of folklorist John A. Lomax, whose 1910 book
"Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads" was a pioneering work in
the field of music preservation. Among the famous songs it saved for
posterity was "Home on the Range."</LD>
<TE>   Among the famous musicians the Lomaxes were the first to record
were iconic figures such as Woody Guthrie, Huddie Ledbetter, later
known as Leadbelly, and Muddy Waters.</TE>
<TE>   They discovered Ledbetter on a prison farm in Louisiana and when
his recording of "Goodnight, Irene" was released, it started the
nation's folk music revival.</TE>
<TE>   His influence extends to contemporary artists such as the
electronica star Moby, whose tracks have incorporated excerpts from
Lomax's field recordings of folk and blues music. Two songs from his
collection were featured on the 2002 Grammy-winning soundtrack of "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?"</TE>
<TE>   Alan Lomax was still in his teens when he began assisting his
father in efforts to interview and record musicians of almost every
stripe.</TE>
<TE>   Long before tape recording became feasible, the work entailed
lugging around recording equipment that weighed hundreds of pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Lomax said making it possible to record and play back music in
remote areas "gave a voice to the voiceless" and "put neglected
cultures and silenced people into the communications chain."</TE>
<TE>   Much of their work was done for the Library of Congress, where the
Archive of American Folk Song had been established in 1928.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the music that seemed exotic in the 1930s had a profound
influence on the development of rock 'n' roll. In "The Rolling Stone
Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll," critic Robert Palmer wrote about
a black religious "ring shout" song, "Run Old Jeremiah," recorded by
the Lomaxes in a tiny rural church in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   "The rhythmic singing, the hard-driving beat, the bluesy melody
and the improvised, stream-of-consciousness words of this particular
shout ... all anticipate key aspects of rock &amp; roll as it would
emerge some 20 years later," Palmer wrote.</TE>
<TE>   As interest in folklore and minority groups' culture has grown in
recent decades, experts and fans alike have been able to draw upon
the recordings made so long ago.</TE>
<TE>   When interest in Cajun music and its cousin, zydeco, exploded in
the 1980s, for example, a two-album set of the Lomaxes' recordings
from the 1930s was issued.</TE>
<TE>   The Lomaxes "were recording people who were old then, and taking
machines to houses and recording home music," Louisiana folklore
expert Barry Ancelet, who edited the album, said in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Lomax recalled the Louisiana recording sessions vividly.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, it was wonderful, but simply bewildering. All these
new kinds of songs were simply mysteries," Lomax said. Citing one
song with a particularly complex rhythm, he said, "When I recorded
it, there had been nothing like it in America before."</TE>
<TE>   His book "The Land Where the Blues Began" won the 1993 National
Book Critics Circle award for nonfiction. It documented the stories,
musicians and listeners behind blues music. He not only recounted
meetings with Waters before he became famous but with musicians who
never made it big, such as a prison singer named Bama and a
railway-track rhythm caller named Houston Bacon. "It's impossible not
to be fascinated by these oral histories of roustabouts, work gangs,
evil 'Mister Charlies' and levee mule teams," a reviewer for the Los
Angeles Times wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Lomax's five-part documentary series "American Patchwork"
was shown on PBS, exploring such topics as the blues, Cajun culture
and the British roots of Appalachian music.</TE>
<TE>   The final episode, "Dreams and Songs of the Noble Old," featured
elderly balladeers and musicians who pass their music to the young.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not preservation, it's process," Lomax said. "It's keeping
things going."</TE>
<TE>   In his research, Lomax photographed the musicians and recorded
their thoughts as well as their tunes, asking them where they had
learned the songs and what the songs meant to them.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 off-Broadway show "Jelly Roll!" as well as the book
"Mister Jelly Roll" were based in part on Lomax's 1938 interviews
with Morton.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Lomax inspired folklorists across the country to
document reactions to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and
Virginia. His body of work includes interviews with average Americans
after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, a collection maintained by
the Library of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Lomax didn't limit his efforts to the United States, doing
extensive work in Spain, Italy, Britain and the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   He worked to compile a world survey of folk songs, which deepened
the understanding of the links between peoples.</TE>
<TE>   Lomax believed our centralized electronic communications system is
imposing "standardized, mass-produced and cheapened cultures
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   "If those absolutely important things are ignored, of ... how we
adapted to the planet, then we're going to lose something precious,"
he told Associated Press in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be anywhere to go and no place to come home to."</TE>
<TE>   Lomax is survived by a daughter and a sister.</TE>

<LD>Donna O'Neill, a conservationist and philanthropist who helped create
one of Orange County's most pristine land preserves and was a leader
of the Hereditary Disease Foundation, has died. She was 73.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill, who had been diagnosed with cancer six months ago, died
Thursday at the Ranch House on Rancho Mission Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   She spent much of her life at the 23,850-acre ranch, which her
husband's family has owned since 1882.</LD>
<TE>   It is the largest working cattle ranch in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill was a driving force behind the family's decision to set
aside 1,250 acres of the ranch as a preserve for endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   While serving as a board member of what became the Rancho Mission
Viejo Land Conservancy, she promoted research on mountain lions,
raptors and other indigenous creatures.</TE>
<TE>   As a trustee of the Hereditary Disease Foundation, she and her
husband, Richard, supported a unique approach to medical research.
The foundation held workshops for scientists to brainstorm without
worrying about the usual medical industry decorum or presenting
formal papers.</TE>
<TE>   Those familiar with the foundation say the workshops led to
breakthroughs in genetic research.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill surrounded herself with writers and artists, and had been
a benefactor to many of them.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew and befriended them," said Susan Spivak, a longtime
friend.</TE>
<TE>   "She hired Frank Gehry when he was not yet the Frank Gehry we know
today. He designed the hay barn at the ranch and their swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the most extraordinary, unusual, elegant person I ever
knew," Spivak said. "She was someone I wished I could be more like."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill is survived by her husband, Richard.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Hereditary
Disease Foundation, the Rancho Mission Viejo Land Conservancy and the
National Audubon Society.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Plan Found to Violate 1st Amendment</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Judge voids voter-OKd Pasadena initiative barring
certain donations to city officials. Backers of the measure voice
dismay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge declared a controversial campaign
finance reform initiative in Pasadena unconstitutional only weeks
after ordering the city to put the law on its books.</LD>
<LD>   Judge J. Michael Byrne issued his ruling from the bench Thursday,
stating that the Taxpayer Protection Amendment overly restricts
freedom of speech.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative's goal is to prevent quid pro quo votes and
donations by preventing city officials from accepting gifts, jobs or
campaign contributions from anyone to whom they awarded a "public
benefit" within the last five years or for a year after leaving
office. Approved by 60% of Pasadena voters in 2001, the measure
defines public benefits in various ways, such as a contract worth
more than $25,000.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Monica-based Oaks Project, the voter-organizing arm of
the Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights, wrote the initiative
and sponsored the drive to get comparable measures on the ballot in
Santa Monica, San Francisco and Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only San Francisco has developed regulations based on the
measure. Officials in the other cities believe that the initiative is
overly restrictive and would require tremendous resources to enforce.
Oaks Project officials deny those claims.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica tried to get a ruling on the measure's validity by
suing its own city clerk for not enforcing it. Anticipating a prompt
decision in that case, Pasadena City Atty. Michele Beal Bagneris
directed Pasadena's city clerk in June 2001 not to file the amendment
to the city's charter with the secretary of state to make Measure B
law.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court judge dismissed the Santa Monica case this April
on procedural grounds, however. After more than a year passed without
Pasadena processing the necessary paperwork, city resident Rene Amy
sued to get a judge to compel the city to put its measure on the
books.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Pasadena filed a motion June 18, requesting that
Byrne rule on Measure B's merits and strike down what the city states
is an unconstitutional law.</TE>
<TE>   Byrne agreed with the city Thursday. Oaks Projects lawyers had
filed a motion just two days earlier arguing that Byrne did not have
jurisdiction to make such a ruling, and his decision Thursday took
them by surprise. They had yet to offer any arguments on the
constitutionality of the measure because they were focused on another
lawsuit related to the case.</TE>
<TE>   "There has never been a single sentence on the merits filed by the
Oaks," said Fredric Woocher, the Oaks Project's primary attorney on
the case. "The judge made his decision based on one side alone."</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Balber, Oaks Project director, said, "We were astonished.
We don't expect this to be a lasting decision."</TE>
<TE>   The Oaks Project plans to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaard, Pasadena said he is pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "In my view [Measure B] simply goes too far in the balance between
seeking integrity among elected office and the ability to serve in
public office," he said. "It places a significant block on people's
willingness to serve in public office."</TE>
<TE>   Balber disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "For each of these cities it's a smack in the face for the voters,
to challenge what the voters have spoken and clearly said they want."</TE>

<LD>Bobby Worth, 89, a composer and lyricist whose songs were recorded by
Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and many other artists in
the 1940s, '50s and '60s, died of natural causes Wednesday at a
private care facility in Mission Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Among the best known of his several hundred songs are "Do I
Worry?" "Tonight We Love," "Don't You Know?" and "Lazy Countryside."</LD>
<LD>   Born in Cleveland in 1912, Worth began playing piano as a child,
and by age 8 was performing classical music in concert. As a
teenager, he joined Gus Edwards' vaudeville act.</LD>
<TE>   Worth later formed and led his own dance band, and played piano
and sang on his own radio shows in New York. He also wrote scores for
Shipstad and Johnson's Ice Follies and wrote songs for Disney and
several other studios.</TE>

<HD>Praying, Day and Night, for Hollywood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Bruckheimer don't know me, but I've been
praying for them and their staff.</LD>
<LD>   I belong to a group called Hollywood Prayer Watch. For five years,
we've been bombarding Hollywood with intercessory prayers. We pray
for its children and families. We pray for its drug addicts and
dealers and prostitutes and homeless. We pray for people in the
entertainment industry. We pray for law enforcement officers who
patrol Hollywood and politicians who represent it.</LD>
<LD>   We do this in the belief that prayer can transform Hollywood's
worldwide influence.</LD>
<TE>   On the first and second Saturday of each month, 150 of us from the
First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood arrange our schedules so that
someone is praying every minute of those days, in half-hour segments.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds from other churches and ministries, such as the Monroe
Street Christian Church and Hollywood Christian Life Center, also
participate. We also are connected to a global prayer outreach
numbering tens of thousands through an interdenominational network of
prayer leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The global network, International Prayer Council, is headed by a
Pasadena man named John Robb. Robb, who has worked in 100 countries
since 1976, says he's asked often, "Why do you [America] ship over
your movies that are so full of violence and immorality?" Last year,
after he was confronted with the question, he thought to himself,
"Why not let the nations pray for Hollywood?" That's how he linked up
his legion of prayer networks overseas with those of us who pray
here.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a potential for God's transforming power to come in
and to make Hollywood a more wholesome place," says Robb. "We have a
lot of hope."</TE>
<TE>   The woman who launched the Hollywood prayer initiative is the Rev.
Jeri Penley of Sylmar. She's a mother of two teenagers who spends her
days working at an Encino brokerage firm as a sales assistant. She
and her partner, the Rev. David Andrade, also operate the Strategic
Prayer Strike Center in Pasadena, which trains people in intercessory
worship.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1997, Penley approached churches, ministries and people
she knew in Hollywood and got them to commit.</TE>
<TE>   "The needs are huge, but God is so much greater," says Helen
Griffith, who has been serving as a volunteer coordinator for the
Hollywood prayer effort since its inception. Griffith, whose parents
served as medical missionaries to Korea in the 1920s, chooses the
subjects for monthly Hollywood prayers, offering appropriate Bible
verses and specific suggestions for intercessors. Her monthly prayer
letter packet arrives at our homes about a week before the prayer
slots are scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I get it, I read it and begin to prepare myself," says
one intercessor, retired electrical engineer Dick Hamilton, 77. His
slot is 6 a.m. on the second Saturday of the month. He prays in his
bedroom, seated on his bed.</TE>
<TE>   He has no difficulty praying for schools, churches, police
officers and firefighters and folks in the entertainment industry. He
grew up here, attending Fairfax High School. But Hamilton says he
found praying last Saturday for gangs, at Griffith's suggestion,
"tough" because he had no personal association with gang-bangers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as he prayed, he said, he felt the Holy Spirit interceding in
his behalf. "By faith, we have to trust that God knows what's best."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith's suggestions to the intercessors had included praying
for understanding and courage for the kids who are invited to join
the gangs in Hollywood. Pray for them to resist, she said, and pray
that those who want to leave gangs will be given courage to leave and
will be protected by God.</TE>
<TE>   My prayer slot is 9 to 9:30 p.m. on the second Saturday of the
month. Over the years, this has presented some interesting
challenges. I've slipped out of dinner parties to pray. I've put on
dark glasses so I could close my eyes for prayer in airport lounges.
Last Saturday night, I excused myself in the middle of an
after-dinner stroll to linger on a park bench in Santa Monica to pray
for such gangs as 18th Street, Mara Salvatrucha and White Fence. I
tried to see them as God might see them, creatures made in his image
and loved by him.</TE>
<TE>   Like Dick Hamilton, many of us from mainstream Protestant
denominations tend to pray in silence--sitting or kneeling quietly as
we present our petitions to God and thank him for what he is going to
do.</TE>
<TE>   But other intercessors, such as those who gather on Friday
evenings at the International House of Prayer in Hollywood, approach
praise, worship and prayer with spontaneity--even exuberance. The
house of prayer, which borrows the Monroe Street Christian Church for
its biweekly meetings, tries to re-create the spirit of the
Tabernacle of David where praise and worship were said to have
continued 24 hours a day for 33 years. With musicians and
intercessors working together as a team, they sing, accompanied by a
guitar, bongo drums and a rain stick. They read verses from the
Bible, especially from the Psalms. They raise their hands heavenward.
Sometimes they dance.</TE>
<TE>   The house of prayer is another of Penley's initiatives. It's
patterned after the International House of Prayer in Kansas City,
Mo., believed to be the only place in the country where intercessor
missionaries and musicians pray and worship 24 hours a day.
Hollywood's house of prayer draws intercessors from as far as Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Wood, an escrow officer and member of the Monroe Street
Christian Church, was there in a shirt emblazoned "Addicted to
Jesus." Sometimes, she sat still with her eyes closed in prayer, and
at other times, she sang along exuberantly with the praise and
worship team.</TE>
<TE>   Some who pray for Hollywood say they have seen results: more PG
movies, they suggest; greater receptivity to the Bible among
Hollywood's homeless and prostitutes, say others. The International
Prayer Council's Robb says that in January, 175 people in the
entertainment world rededicated their lives to Christ after hearing
the Rev. Bruce Wilkinson, the author of the "The Prayer of Jabez,"
speak in Hollywood. Robb says a powerful industry figure gave up a
$6-million deal involving distribution technology for pornography
after his conversion to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes against what the world usually thinks ... because we have
a very materialistic culture and value system," Robb says. "But I'm
convinced that the Lord wants to bring healing to nations and this is
already happening."</TE>

<HD>Police Presence in City Parks Grows</HD>
<DH>Safety: Hahn touts the opening of 62 LAPD stop-in centers,
through which officers aim to curb crime and improve community
relations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The message coming out of a Friday gathering of Los Angeles
officials, community leaders and residents was unmistakably clear:
Take back city parks from gangs and drug dealers and return them to
neighborhood children and their families.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn, backed by about 50 supporters at the Delano
Park Recreation Center in Van Nuys, announced the opening of LAPD
stop-in centers at 62 city parks, where criminal activity has risen
in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   "Too many of our parks are being used by gang members and drug
dealers, and not the families and children for whom they were built,"
Hahn said. "L.A.'s ability to provide safe parks--free from gangs,
crime and drugs--is an important measure of the health of our
neighborhoods, and the overall well-being of our city."</LD>
<TE>   At Hahn's request, a joint committee of the Los Angeles Police
Department, the Los Angeles Police Commission and the Los Angeles
Recreation and Parks Commission came up with the concept of stop-in
centers to establish a police presence at 62 of 300 city parks,
including Delano Park, where brazen criminals and mothers pushing
baby strollers battle for turf.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers on routine patrol will use the stop-in centers to
write reports, make phone calls and chat with residents about their
concerns, Interim L.A. Police Chief Martin Pomeroy said. The program
will not require hiring new officers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders such as Candido Marez of Van Nuys, who helped
launch a youth soccer program involving about 2,000 children in
Delano Park, welcomed the stop-in center.</TE>
<TE>   "A few months ago, this park was infested with gangs," he said.
"Now, with the help of the LAPD, we are able to have programs here."</TE>
<TE>   Delano Park Recreation Director Ramon Cerrillos said occasional
and unexpected visits by police will help curb crime and improve
community relations.</TE>
<TE>   "The police presence alone, with the squad car out front and the
officer inside, deters people from wrongdoing or just loitering," he
said. "The stop-in center pulls the police officer off the street and
into the [recreation center], where he is more approachable and can
answer questions from the community."</TE>
<TE>   Andria Mickens of Van Nuys, who learned about the police stop-in
center Friday while registering her daughters for summer camp, said
the move was reassuring. "It makes me feel comfortable knowing that
there will be someone else watching out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The stop-in centers are one of several park-safety initiatives
implemented this year by the Los Angeles Police Commission. Others
include improvements in the oversight of patrols, mounted patrols,
bicycle officers, crime-suppression units and "safe-house" placards
at designated park buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Information about which parks will have stop-in centers may be
obtained by calling the Department of Recreation and Parks at (888)
527-2757.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Forest Service has told a tenant that his 20-foot flagpole
is unauthorized and has to go.</LD>
<LD>   David Knickerbocker has flown a U.S. flag on the pole near his
summer cabin for almost two decades. The former Stockton police
officer and Army veteran, who leases a lot in El Dorado National
Forest, called the order "unbelievable."</LD>
<LD>   The agency discovered the pole when it began inspecting lots for
lease renewal. "If you're putting holes in the ground where Native
Americans once resided, that needs an archeological review," said
Forest Service spokesman Frank Mosbacher.</LD>

<LD>A Sonoma County Superior Court judge decided against a motion Friday
to remove prosecutors in the case of inactive priest Don Kimball, who
is charged with assaulting a news photographer.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Public Defender Michael Perry filed the motion in June to
have the Sonoma County prosecutors replaced with attorneys from
another county because two people who work in prosecutor's office
testified at the preliminary hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Kimball, 58, faces a felony assault charge for allegedly shoving a
camera in a San Francisco Chronicle photographer's face in April at
Kimball's sexual assault trial. He was sentenced to seven years in
prison for molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1981.</LD>

<HD>Denial of L.A.'s Request on Hollywood Split Is Urged</HD>
<DH>Secession: LAFCO official says city failed to show decision
calling for a ballot vote was flawed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The executive officer of the commission that put Hollywood secession
on the Nov. 5 ballot recommended Friday that the panel reject a city
of Los Angeles request that the decision be reconsidered.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Calemine, in a report to the Local Agency Formation
Commission, said the city failed to show the decision calling for the
secession election was based on faulty fiscal analysis.</LD>
<LD>   Calemine also said the commission should stand by a second
decision to hold at-large elections for five Hollywood city council
seats. Civil rights groups have said the elections should be held by
district to avoid diluting Latino voter strength.</LD>
<TE>   But Calemine cited a study by redistricting expert Stephen P.
Klein that concluded: "Hispanic-preferred candidates would win as
many, if not more, council seats under the system adopted by LAFCO as
they would under a district system."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Clayton of the Latino Redistricting Coalition said he would
review Calemine's report before deciding whether to file a complaint
with the U.S. Justice Department about the at-large plan.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine said the city did not support its position that an
independent Hollywood should pay the remainder of Los Angeles $73.1
million annually if secession wins. LAFCO has set the figure at $21.4
million for the first year, with gradually decreasing payments for
the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly what we expected," said Leigh Bailey, a
spokeswoman for the Hollywood secession group.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials said LAFCO underestimated the tax revenue
the city would lose if Hollywood seceded. They said LAFCO also failed
to consider centralized costs the remaining city would still have to
cover.</TE>
<TE>   Also, city officials said increasing the separation payment to
$73.1 million would leave Hollywood unable to survive on its own, so
the secession measure should come off the ballot. LAFCO will consider
the city's claims and Calemine's report on July 26.</TE>
<TE>   The panel earlier this month rejected similar claims by the city
regarding the Valley secession measure, which is on the same ballot.</TE>

<HD>Pete Seibert, 77; Founded Popular Ski Resort That Draws
Millions to Vail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Seibert, who founded the nation's largest and most popular ski
hill, Vail Mountain, died Monday of cancer in Vail, Colo. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Although a relative newcomer to the ski scene, the Vail resort
exploded in size and popularity after opening in 1962. The ski area
today covers 5,200 acres, has 33 chairlifts and drew 1.5 million
skiers last season, despite less than ideal snow conditions across
the West.</LD>
<LD>   "He's the father of Vail," said Ludwig Kurz, the town's mayor and
a longtime friend of Seibert. "He had a tremendous impact on Vail and
the Vail Valley and, really, the U.S. ski industry. He set standards
that were higher than had ever been thought of before."</LD>
<TE>   Born in 1924 in New Hampshire, Seibert recognized early on that
skiing was his future. As he told the story, at age 12 he opened a
ski book and saw a photo of a quaint Austrian resort. From that
moment forward, Seibert said, "there was nothing I wanted more in my
life than to start a ski area."</TE>
<TE>   But first came World War II. Because he was talented on skis,
Seibert was recruited to join the Army's 10th Mountain Division.</TE>
<TE>   The unit had been formed in 1941 when the head of the National Ski
Patrol convinced the Army that the military was thoroughly unprepared
to go to battle in the mountains of Europe--and that it was easier to
make soldiers out of skiers than vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Some veterans would later joke that the training was worse than
the war. Based at Camp Hale in the Colorado Rockies, Seibert and
hundreds of others endured "d-series training," during which the unit
spent weeks above 10,000 feet in winter, skiing many miles each day
carrying 90-pound packs.</TE>
<TE>   The actual war featured its own set of horrors. The 10th Mountain
Division was charged with driving the Germans from the Alps. Seibert
was hit by mortar fire in the Appenine Mountains of northern Italy,
and his right kneecap was badly damaged. When he was evacuated from
the front lines--after three days--doctors said he would never again
walk.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Seibert was a ski instructor in Aspen.</TE>
<TE>   The decade after the war was a heady time for the nation's
fledgling ski industry. Businessmen, dreamers and ski bums were
scouring the West for places to build resorts, convinced that the
sport would soon boom in popularity. Veterans of the 10th Mountain
Division were often involved, because they were among the most
talented skiers in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   After a stint learning the hotel business in Switzerland in the
early 1950s, courtesy of the G.I. Bill, Seibert returned to Colorado.
While managing the Loveland ski area near Denver, he and his friend
Earl Eaton began looking for their own ski hill.</TE>
<TE>   Eaton had grown up in Colorado and knew about a "no name" mountain
near Vail Pass. After a seven-hour slog to the summit in the late
1950s, the two peered down into the mountain's enormous, wide-open
back bowls and knew they were looking at a skier's paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were quickly rounded up, and a sheep farm at the
mountain's base was purchased. To mask their intentions from other
ski developers, Seibert and Eaton called the place a rod-and-gun
club. There was no real town, and only one phone in the area, which
was connected to distant Denver by a two-lane highway.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the resort opened, it gained a reputation for its
friendly terrain. Much to the chagrin of other Western resort owners,
Vail's marketers proved brilliant at using the burgeoning airline
industry to lure people from across the globe to town. Soon,
Interstate 70 was built, bringing even more skiers with it.</TE>
<TE>   Then disaster struck. In March 1976, a frayed cable caused two
gondolas carrying skiers up the mountain to plunge 125 feet to the
ground. Four were killed and eight injured.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing the inevitable lawsuits, Seibert sold his stake in the
resort, and Vail changed hands several times. Vail Resorts is now a
publicly traded company and owns several other resorts, including
Breckenridge, Keystone and Beaver Creek in Colorado, Grand Teton
Lodging Co. in Wyoming and Heavenly in California.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since Seibert left, Vail has increasingly been
portrayed by the national media as a sort of two-headed monster. The
skiing is almost universally praised as great. But the resort has
been roundly criticized for encouraging a sprawl of million-dollar
homes in the surrounding area. In 1998, arsonists--apparently upset
at yet another expansion of ski terrain--torched several of the
resort's buildings and chairlifts. No one was ever arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Seibert went on to help start several other resorts in the West,
including Snowbasin in Utah's Wasatch Mountains. He also eventually
returned to work for Vail as a consultant and vigorously pursued his
passions--golf and skiing.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a skier at heart, and he thought that everything that
happened here was maybe a little more than what he envisioned," said
Kurz. "But he never commented to me whether it was good or bad;
that's just the way it was."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by three sons and five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are pending.</TE>

<HD>State OKs Bleach Use for Offshore Sewage Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water officials gave the Orange County Sanitation District the
green light Friday to use up to 25,000 gallons of bleach a day to
disinfect the moderately treated sewage it pipes four miles offshore.</LD>
<LD>   The chlorination plan may do more than protect beachgoers'
health--it should finally prove whether any of the 243 million
gallons of waste water pumped off the coast daily is returning to
pollute Huntington Beach's coastline.</LD>
<LD>   "The district believes that the disinfection of its waste-water
discharge is in the best interest of the community," Bob Ghirelli,
director of technical services for the sanitation district, told the
Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board. "Your action will
help assure beachgoers that the coastal waters of Orange County are
safe."</LD>
<TE>   In addition to killing disease-causing microorganisms, the
disinfectant "will remove the question of our impact on Huntington
Beach's bacterial problem once and for all," said Blake Anderson,
district general manager.</TE>
<TE>   The chlorine kills the three types of bacteria coastal water is
tested for, so if high bacteria counts persist at area beaches,
Anderson said that would prove the waste water plume isn't to blame.
Millions of dollars have been spent on studies, yet there has been no
conclusion about whether the plume is responsible for beach-closings
and warnings that have plagued Surf City.</TE>
<TE>   Approval of the chlorination plan comes two days after the
sanitation district's board of directors voted narrowly to step up
waste-water treatment. In doing so, the board agreed not to seek
renewal of a federal waiver that has allowed the agency to dump
sewage treated to a lesser standard than nearly all of the nation's
16,000 sewer agencies.</TE>

<HD>Engineering Might, Leg Power Put to Test</HD>
<DH>Education: Nine universities compete to build the fastest
human-powered subs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SILVER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ESCONDIDO</DL>
<LD>Picture a drag race with a whole lot of drag and very little race.</LD>
<LD>   Take away the cheering crowd, roaring engines, adoring girls and
teenage angst.</LD>
<LD>   Replace it with dozens of engineers in the making and a few of
their parents, the smell of chlorine instead of exhaust, watercraft
instead of motor craft, and human power instead of horsepower.</LD>
<TE>   Then submerge the scene in a 1.5-million-gallon pool of murky
greenish-gray water.</TE>
<TE>   And they're off. Maybe.</TE>
<TE>   Nine teams of students from universities across the country and
Canada started the first of a three-day competition here Friday to
determine which of their handmade submarines--big enough to hold one
or two people--could propel across a 300-foot tank the fastest.</TE>
<TE>   One at a time, they'll keep running the length of the pool in
hopes of beating the world record of 7.19 knots, if they can move at
all. The University of Washington's vessel, for example, hadn't made
a single run by midafternoon Friday. A problem with buoyancy got in
the way. Race-ending crashes into the sides or bottom of the pool are
common too.</TE>
<TE>   This year's main rivalry at the Human Powered Submarine Contest
matches UC San Diego against the University of Quebec. In 2000, UC
San Diego set the world record in the non-propeller division--using a
wing that flapped like a whale's tail--at 3.47 knots. Quebec holds
the record set last year in the propelled division.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians are racing Omer4, a purple, metallic torpedo-shaped
sub with shark-like fins. They've been modifying the capsule, which
holds three computers, a bike crank for pedaling and joystick for
steering, for two years, said Domonic Goulet, 23, a mechanical
engineering major.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diegans have pinned their hopes on the Inviscid, a term
that means "no friction under water."</TE>
<TE>   The lime-green machine, elliptically shaped to cut down on drag,
is made of fiberglass and aluminum and weighs about 80 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you do enough research you get the same thing [as the other
competitors], as small and sleek as you can make it," said Daniel
Smith, 21, a mechanical engineering major at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The speed trials take place in a tank at Offshore Model Basin in
Escondido. The pool simulates waves, wind and currents on model
ships, barges and oil-drilling platforms to analyze how the life-size
versions, usually 50 times bigger, would fare in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The human-powered subs are about the length of a compact car and
travel about as fast as one in rush hour traffic. Top speed in
Friday's races hit 4.3 knots or about 5 miles per hour. A
nuclear-powered sub can travel about five times faster.</TE>
<TE>   The teams work on their projects with the determination of
Internet entrepreneurs, spending long hours after class in what can
turn into a two- or three-year project.</TE>
<TE>   Some subs cost as much as $60,000 to build and transport to the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Bedore, an engineer from La Mesa and the event's chairman,
said the work the students put into their subs, analyzing the
mechanics of hundreds of parts, working with software, giving
presentations and raising money, is the kind of experience they can't
get in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really care about submarine technology. We care about
making engineers," Bedore said.</TE>
<TE>   The students are all certified scuba divers. One or two of them
per team can be submerged with their scuba gear in the submarines.
The divers propel the subs, which fill up with water, like a bicycle.
They pedal their way across the pool. In one case, a team in this
year's contest used mechanics similar to a stair-stepper to power its
sub.</TE>
<TE>   Yellow caution tape and strings of lights on the floor of the
15-foot-deep pool guide the subs. Underwater speakers call out the
race starts.</TE>
<TE>   Underwater cameras catch the races, as the subs are barely visible
from the surface. Students watching have to get word from divers to
keep up with the action, or attempt to make out the hazy images on a
video monitor split into four screens.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Washington, Quebec and UC San Diego, Millersville
University of Pennsylvania, San Diego State University, Texas A&amp;M,
the University of British Columbia, Virginia Tech and the University
of Montreal are participating.</TE>
<TE>   The speed trials, which run from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. today and from 9
a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday, are open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   It's the second time Escondido has hosted the races. The
competition alternates between the West and East coasts.</TE>

<HD>Jury Rules Woman Who Tried to Drown Her Children Was Insane</HD>
<DH>Port Hueneme: Mother could not tell right from wrong, panel
decides. She will be evaluated by mental experts and then placed in a
state institution or released.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Port Hueneme mother was insane when she tried to drown her children
in Channel Islands Harbor 2 1/2 years ago, a Ventura County jury
decided Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated for nearly two days before concluding that
42-year-old Narinder Virk was suffering from severe depression and
could not tell right from wrong when she walked her son and daughter,
then 9 and 6, to the harbor the night of Jan. 12, 2000, and pushed
them off a dock.</LD>
<LD>   Virk, an illiterate Indian immigrant who maintained she was
isolated and battered by an abusive spouse, wept as the verdict was
announced in Ventura County Superior Court. Supporters seated in the
courtroom also broke into tears, relieved that she had been spared a
possible prison sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Virk's mental state will be evaluated to determine if she
needs treatment or can be released.</TE>
<TE>   After Virk and her children were rescued by a harbor resident, the
mother was charged with attempted murder and pleaded not guilty by
reason of insanity. Defense lawyers tried to negotiate a plea on
lesser charges of child endangerment, but prosecutors refused to
settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   Following a three-week trial, jurors decided a week ago that Virk
was guilty on two counts of attempted murder. The trial advanced to a
second phase this week in which three mental health experts testified
that Virk was delusional, psychotic and legally insane at the time of
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Juror Mireya Carlson, a Thousand Oaks resident, said the testimony
of those experts was persuasive. "All of them said the same thing,"
she said, and "all of them could not possibly be biased."</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside the courthouse Friday, another juror, who did not
want to be identified, said there were many subtleties to the case
and no one factor was key in leading jurors to conclude that Virk was
insane.</TE>
<TE>   "We all had a different approach, but we all came to the same
conclusion," he said. "She was not thinking clearly and was not using
rational thought."</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't an easy decision," he added. "I've always been a
black-and-white type of person, but this one just tore that up."</TE>
<TE>   After the jury was excused Friday, Virk, draped in a pale green
Punjabi scarf, was taken into custody to undergo a six-week
psychiatric evaluation at Ventura County Jail to determine whether
she is still suffering from a mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   Before the verdict was announced, defense attorney Cynthia
Ellington had tried to prepare Virk, knowing she would be taken into
custody either way the jury ruled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very grateful for the decision," Ellington said. "They
listened to our evidence.... That woman was incredibly mentally ill.
And she still is."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County mental health experts will evaluate Virk's
condition in the coming weeks and prepare reports before a Sept. 9
court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   If the experts conclude that she is still insane, Virk would
likely be sent to Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino County for
treatment, lawyers said. But if her sanity is deemed restored, Virk
could be released from custody.</TE>
<TE>   "The interesting question now is whether her sanity is the same as
it was before," said prosecutor Richard Simon. He said the Ventura
County district attorney's office would likely oppose any request for
Virk's release.</TE>
<TE>   As for the verdict, Simon said he was disappointed but respected
the jurors' decision.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Anica Butler and Jessica Blanchard contributed
to this report.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Philanthropist's Body Is Recovered After Tulare
County Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities in Tulare County said Friday that they have identified a
body recovered there as that of Elizabeth Whiting, 66, of Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Whiting had been reported missing July 1 after failing to arrive
at a family vacation home at Shaver Lake in Fresno County. Her car
was found partially submerged in the Tule River.</LD>
<LD>   Whiting, who was known to have had mini-strokes, may have lost
control of her car on California 99, and veered into the river, which
is used as an irrigation canal, said Janet Pope, a spokeswoman for
the Pasadena Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   The car floated about 600 feet downstream from where investigators
believe it entered the river, Pope said. After the river level
dropped, the vehicle's roof became visible and was spotted by a field
worker.</TE>
<TE>   Police said there is no evidence of foul play.</TE>
<TE>   Whiting was known in Pasadena for her philanthropic work with
organizations such as the Pasadena Symphony, Huntington Library,
Pacific Asia Museum, Junior League of Pasadena and the Achievement
Rewards for College Scientists Foundation, a nonprofit organization
that offers scholarships to college students majoring in science and
engineering.</TE>
<TE>   She had six children and 14 grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>A monument honoring dead Irish Republican Army members will be moved
from a border crossroads where the outlawed group once killed two
Protestants, IRA supporters said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is about easing the pain and the grief of victims. I'm
delighted at the decision," said Chris McGimpsey, a Protestant
politician who campaigned against the monument's location.</LD>

<HD>All Sides in Iran Seize on Bush's Condemnations</HD>
<DH>Politics: Hard-liners and reformers, both facing waning
support, seek to use U.S. criticisms to rally the public to their
side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Battered by growing public frustration with the slow pace of economic
and social reforms, Iran's hard-line religious leaders are trying to
use recent statements by President Bush to rally their nation to
their side.</LD>
<LD>   But so are their opponents.</LD>
<LD>   From radicals calling for a separation of church and state to
religious nationalists who want to preserve the Islamic character of
the republic, virtually every political faction has tried to co-opt
Bush's sentiments to serve its own agenda.</LD>
<TE>   Friday was the hard-liners' turn.</TE>
<TE>   While continuing to rely on the police and the courts to silence
their opponents, the Islamic leadership assembled thousands of
demonstrators here in the capital to condemn Bush's most recent
criticism of the regime--which cut to the core of the hard-liners'
greatest vulnerability: their lack of broad public support.</TE>
<TE>   "We are facing a cruel and powerful [U.S.] government, and we have
to be cautious and awake," former President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
during Friday prayers at Tehran University, according to Associated
Press. "The most important thing is the presence of people."</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Islamic leaders have dominated Iran since shortly
after the revolution in 1979, and continue to do so despite the 1997
election of moderate reformer Mohammad Khatami as president.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush opened his own rhetorical front with Tehran in his State
of the Union address in January, labeling Iran part of an "axis of
evil," members of the reform movement led by Khatami said the U.S.
leader was undermining their efforts. The reformers argued--and still
insist--that Bush had only managed to unify Iranians around the
hard-liners by lumping this nation together with Iraq and North Korea
as alleged supporters of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In contemporary Iran, everyone in power is vulnerable. Both the
reformers and hard-liners find their public support slipping because
the economy is weak, corruption rampant and the pace of social change
slow. But in that environment, reformers say they are concerned that
Bush has given hard-liners ammunition to solidify the conservative
base of support and made it impossible for the reform movement to
advocate improved relations with the West. Khatami attended the rally
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "When Bush named Iran as the axis of evil, the hard-liners became
happy," said Hamid Reza Jalaiepour, an influential reformer. "They
can then mobilize the part of the country that supports them.... This
sort of action is good for their control over the religious people."</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, reformers have tried to use the fear of
conservatives to rally their own diminished support.</TE>
<TE>   Heshmatola Tabarzadi was in prison, held in solitary confinement
because of his fight for separation of church and state, when Bush
gave the State of the Union address. Tabarzadi thinks he was released
because the regime wanted to counter the accusation that it is
authoritarian.</TE>
<TE>   "After Bush's speech, the Islamic Republic felt very frustrated
and the government wanted to win back public opinion," he said. "If
Mr. Bush did not make those comments, me and my friends would still
be in prison."</TE>
<TE>   His friends agree.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it was Bush's idea, or if a consultant told him
what to say, but when he said that a minority is governing the
majority, that was very true," said Parviz Safari, a colleague of
Tabarzadi and another activist who was released from prison shortly
after the speech.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Yazdi is leader of the Freedom Movement of Iran, a
national religious party that wants democracy within the context of
Islamic values. Still, the government views him as an enemy and has
locked up many of his colleagues. He went to the United States for
cancer treatment in November 2000 and was beyond the reach of the
hard-liners. Many here say he has not been arrested since his return
in April because of the pressure exerted by Bush's statements.</TE>
<TE>   Yazdi does not go that far, because to commend Bush or the United
States in the present environment would bring political rebuke. Since
the revolution, anti-American sentiment has been one of the
psychological devices employed by the regime to rally support. But
Yazdi is openly using Bush's words to promote his agenda: democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I am emphasizing the foreign threat," he said in an
interview. "We are saying it is serious; we don't know how serious,
but serious."</TE>
<TE>   His prescription for addressing that threat: internal
reconciliation between all political factions. "We must reduce
political tension internally, release political prisoners, cancel
verdicts against newspapers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the threat posed by Bush requires Iran to better
adapt to the post-Sept. 11 world. "We have better relations with
Europe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Bush expressed U.S. support for Iranians rallying
behind a popular cleric who resigned to protest the paralyzing
control the conservative clergy held over civil and elected
institutions. In blunt language, Bush said the ruling Islamic clerics
have produced "uncompromising and destructive" policies.</TE>
<TE>   "Iranian students, journalists and parliamentarians are still
arrested, intimidated and abused for advocating reform or criticizing
the ruling regime," he said. "Independent publications are
suppressed. And talented students and professionals, faced with the
dual specter of too few jobs and too many restrictions on their
freedom, continue to seek opportunities abroad rather than help build
Iran's future at home."</TE>
<TE>   The comments promoted angry calls for the U.S. to stop interfering
in the nation's internal affairs--and for Iranians to rally around
the leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "America cannot do a damn thing against Iran," read one banner at
Friday's demonstration. "The great Satan is not able to harm
Iranians," read another.</TE>

<HD>'Martyrdom' Dreams Take Root Early in the West Bank</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A winsome 11-year-old girl smiles shyly at a talk-show moderator and
answers questions about her ambitions.</LD>
<LD>   "Martyrdom is a beautiful thing. Everyone longs for martyrdom,"
the girl says. "What could be better than going to paradise?"</LD>
<LD>   The show aired early last month on the official television station
of the Palestinian Authority and is just one example of how
thoroughly the concept of the martyr has infused Palestinian culture
and the official media.</LD>
<TE>   Suicide bombers are celebrated in television programming, popular
music, religious sermons and textbooks. A poem in a seventh-grade
reading book says, "I see my death, but I hasten my steps toward it."
The unlined faces of the latest "martyrs" smile with childish
innocence from posters plastered on the walls of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   A furor erupted last month when the Israeli army released a
photograph, seized during a West Bank raid, of a Palestinian infant
dressed in the outfit of a suicide bomber, with a red scarf around
his head and a belt of fake explosives around his waist. Although a
relative dismissed it as a gag photograph snapped at a family party,
the "baby bomber," as he was dubbed by the Israeli media, struck
Israelis as proof positive of a deadly craze.</TE>
<TE>   "This madness has become an epidemic in Palestinian society. In
other places they want to become football players. Here they want to
blow themselves up," said Eran Lehrman, a former Israeli army
intelligence officer who works for the American Jewish Committee in
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Many Israelis charge that the Palestinian leadership under
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has deliberately
cultivated the culture of the martyr in an attempt to recruit
children as terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Two polls published last month show that more than 60% of
Palestinians support suicide bombings within Israel. But many are
also concerned about the phenomenon and its impact on their children.</TE>
<TE>   "I am afraid to let my son watch television," said a Palestinian
translator, who asked not to be quoted by name. "My son is only 4
years old. All the time, he used to say that he wants to be a
journalist when he grows up. His grandfather--he is a
cardiologist--keeps saying, no, he should be a doctor. We were joking
with him a few days ago, asking which will it be? And he says, 'I
want to be a shahid  [a martyr].' ... I really went nuts. I couldn't
believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Media Watch, an Israeli group that scans the Arab
media for examples of incitement, released a report last week
accusing the Palestinian Authority of using ancient religious
concepts of human sacrifice for political purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Among the examples was the talk show "Letters From Our People,"
which aired last month on the authority's Palestinian Broadcasting
Corp. The show featured Palestinian youths, ranging in age from 11 to
19, who were discussing suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   According to a transcript released by the group, 11-year-old Wala
is asked by a moderator, "What is better, peace and full rights for
the Palestinian people or martyrdom?"</TE>
<TE>   "Martyrdom," the girl replies.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course martyrdom is better," Yussra, 11, adds. "We don't want
this world, we want the afterlife.... Every Palestinian child ...
says, 'O Lord, I would like to become a shahid.' "</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian television also aired a provocative Islamic sermon in
March, shortly before a deadly wave of bombings. "We must yearn for
martyrdom and request it from God," declared cleric Ahmed Abdul
Razek. "God planted within our youth the love of jihad [holy
struggle], the love of martyrdom. Our youth have turned into bombs.
They blow themselves up day and night."</TE>
<TE>   Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, said the
broadcasts go a long way toward explaining how it is that so many
youths have volunteered to become suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that the people who carry out suicide bombings
believe they are doing what is expected of them by their society and
their God. It is what they are taught by Palestinian television. They
are brainwashed. They need deprogramming of the most urgent nature,"
Marcus said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian broadcasting executives counter that their programming
simply mirrors the sentiments of society at large.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to reflect what is going on and what the people believe
in," said Saadu Sabawi, chief news editor and director of foreign
news coverage for the Palestinian Broadcasting Corp. "We are not
inventing the crisis. The children who become martyrs don't do it
because of television. They do it because of what the Israelis are
doing to them ... because of the violence and the humiliation."</TE>
<TE>   Sabawi said he was not familiar with the particular programs the
Israelis criticized but said they did not sound unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis have frequently complained about the Palestinian media.
In October 2000, a few weeks into the wave of violence that has
engulfed the region for nearly 22 months, one of the first targets of
Israeli bombing was the main broadcasting tower for the West Bank.
The Palestinian Broadcasting Corp., which was briefly off the air,
has since moved its operations to the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   At the Dahaisha refugee camp near the West Bank city of Bethlehem
recently, several boys recited song lyrics about the heroics of
self-sacrifice that they said they heard on a private Christian-owned
station in Bethlehem called Nativity Television. "Atef challenged the
enemy fire by himself, and the enemy was defeated," one song goes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the boys said that although they admired those held up as
martyrs, they wouldn't necessarily want to be one. But there were
exceptions. Mutasem abu Ajamiyya, 9, spoke with a seriousness that
made it seem entirely plausible that he would carry out his ambition.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to become a suicide bomber. I want to kill as many of them
as possible. I will go to the bus station and explode myself in front
of them," Mutasem said, adding that he has not told his parents of
his plans. "This is my wish. I will keep it to myself until I grow
up."</TE>
<TE>   Among Palestinian adults, the debate over suicide bombings focuses
not on ethics but on the effectiveness of this type of "military
operation." They rarely use the term "suicide bombing."</TE>
<TE>   "These operations do not help our national plan for freedom and
independence. On the contrary, they strengthen the enemies of peace
and give pretexts to the aggressive government of [Israeli Prime
Minister] Ariel Sharon to pursue his furious war against our people,"
read an open letter that was published last month in the Jerusalem
newspaper Al Quds with the signatures of 55 prominent Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   But even some of those who signed the petition refuse to condemn
the bombers themselves and believe that there is some merit to the
attacks. "It is frustrating to see them [Israelis] having a relaxed
life, going to the beach, going to the cafes when their sons in the
army are doing these atrocities," said Isla Jad, a professor at
Ramallah's Birzeit University.</TE>
<TE>   And many Palestinians who had been considered prominent in the
peace movement in the past refused to sign.</TE>
<TE>   "People were laughing at those 55 who signed the petition. It was
an embarrassment," said Mahdi Abdul Hadi, the director of Passia, a
respected Palestinian think tank in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, Israel has counted 91 Palestinian suicide
bombers and says it has captured 42 would-be bombers. The youngest
one taken was 14. Israeli military intelligence believes that there
is a virtually unlimited pool of Palestinians ready to sacrifice
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the Israeli army seized a videotape in Nablus that
contains a nearly three-hour lesson on making a suicide bomb. In the
highly technical tape, a masked instructor demonstrates how to
construct a belt of explosives and lectures on the best place to
stand on a bus to cause the maximum casualties. The cassette, which
also includes Islamic prayers, is believed to have been made by the
military wing of Hamas, an Islamic militant movement.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli military intelligence officer who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the logistics of carrying out a suicide bombing are
still so difficult that a rash of attacks carried out by freelance
operatives is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "They have more potential bombers than they have explosives," said
the officer. "They think of it [suicide bombing] as their only
weapons. A great weapon, a cheap weapon ... but it still requires an
infrastructure, money, materials."</TE>

<HD>Israel Threatens to Deport Suspects' Kin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces arrested 21 male relatives of suspected Palestinian
killers Friday and threatened to deport them, an unusual measure that
was quickly condemned by human rights organizations.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli army said it had rounded up the fathers, brothers and
sons of several militants it suspects in deadly attacks on Israelis,
including assaults this week that claimed the lives of 12 victims.
Army bulldozers demolished houses belonging to two militants--and
damaged those of their neighbors--near the West Bank city of Nablus.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli state radio said the government is considering whether to
expel the relatives to the Gaza Strip from their West Bank homes.</LD>
<TE>   Between 1967, when Israel captured and occupied the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, and 1992, the Israeli government deported to other
nations 1,522 Palestinians who were accused of terrorism or
affiliation with certain political groups. But human rights and legal
experts say Israel never deported relatives not implicated in
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, it is obvious that we are being pushed to do things that we
would willingly prefer not to do," Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres told Israel Radio on Friday morning. "But what happened this
week [a double suicide bombing in Tel Aviv and an attack on a bus
near the West Bank settlement of Emmanuel] ... it almost leaves us no
choice."</TE>
<TE>   Even Peres, generally regarded as a dove who still believes in
pursuing peace with the Palestinians, said he supports deportation if
legal foundation can be established.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Atty. Gen. Elyakim Rubinstein met Friday with security
officials to discuss the legality of such a measure. He reiterated
his position that massive deportation cannot be supported legally;
some evidence, he said, must be found to indicate that the relative
had assisted or supported the accused. Other officials said Israel is
seeking ways to deny suicide bombers the environment that hides and
encourages them.</TE>
<TE>   The demolition of houses is a tactic that has been used by Israeli
security forces through the years. Deportations, however, have been
more unusual in recent times.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of banishing relatives of Palestinian suspects to the
Gaza Strip reflects the growing frustration among Israeli authorities
unable to stop attacks on civilians. The killings this week defied
the tight control Israeli forces have over the West Bank; tanks and
troops have occupied most major Palestinian cities and many towns for
nearly a month, placing about 800,000 Palestinians under virtual
house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Gaza, unlike the West Bank, is physically separated from Israel by
a heavily fortified fence. Few attackers have infiltrated from the
strip into Israel.</TE>
<TE>   When violence erupted this week, the government of Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon came under heated criticism from both the right and
left--either for not cracking down hard enough on Palestinians or for
failing to pursue a political and diplomatic solution to the region's
worst bloodshed in years. Deportation would be likely to win support
among the Israeli public.</TE>
<TE>   In Tel, a village south of Nablus, soldiers early Friday destroyed
the house of Nasser Assida, 26, an operative in the military wing of
the radical Islamic Hamas movement who Israel suspects organized
Tuesday's bus ambush outside Emmanuel. Nine people, most of them
settlers, were killed in the attack. Assida is suspected of
organizing another ambush at the same spot in December, in which 11
people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers arrested Assida's father and four brothers, plus the
relatives of other Hamas leaders, according to reports from the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   In the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, the army destroyed the
three-story family home of a commander of the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, a militia affiliated with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement. Ali Ajouri, 23, is suspected by
Israel of organizing Wednesday's double suicide bombing, which killed
three other people in a working-class neighborhood of Tel Aviv.
Soldiers arrested his father and two brothers. Neither Assida nor
Ajouri was captured.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the operations were designed to "make terrorists
aware of the price of their actions."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said Friday that sending
relatives of suspects into exile represents collective punishment
illegal under both Israeli and international law.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most fundamental principles of law is that one person
cannot be punished for the acts of another, even in response to
murderous acts against civilians," B'Tselem spokesman Lior Yavne
said. "It is true that [Palestinian militants] are targeting innocent
civilians, but the Israeli government cannot respond by taking other
innocent civilians and deporting them.... It loses moral
justification."</TE>
<TE>   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said, "We
expect that Israel's actions ... will be based on information that's
related to an individual's culpability, not to personal or family
relationships." And a spokeswoman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said self-defense could not justify measures that amount to
collective punishments.</TE>
<TE>   A security source confirmed that 21 relatives were arrested. Later
Friday, an additional 16 Palestinians were detained in separate
operations, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel Gross, a professor of international law at Haifa
University and a former military court judge, warned Friday that
deportation should be limited to those who pose a security risk.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strength is to adhere to law and morality, and under no
circumstance should we lose that," he told Israel Radio. "The army
and the judiciary have always been guided by the ancient code put
forth in the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah, when it was decided that
no longer would sons be punished for the sins of their fathers, that
each would perish for his own sin alone."</TE>

<HD>Russian in Lake Subject of Probe</HD>
<DH>Crime: Slain Southland businessman was being sought by
authorities in his homeland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>At the time of his death, a Russian businessman whose body was pulled
from a Northern California reservoir in the spring was being sought
for questioning by Russian investigators in connection with an
$8-million embezzlement case.</LD>
<LD>   FBI investigators describe George Safiev as a victim of a
kidnapping scheme run by former Soviet citizens. The plot allegedly
involved snatching five Los Angeles-area residents, extorting money
from their relatives and associates, then killing the kidnap victims
and dumping their bodies in the reservoir.</LD>
<LD>   Five suspects, all in custody in Los Angeles, are charged with
kidnapping and could face the death penalty if convicted. A sixth
suspect remains at large.</LD>
<TE>   Other than Safiev's considerable wealth, the FBI has suggested no
other motive for his abduction. But a Russian law enforcement source
who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Times that Safiev's
business dealings, including his possible involvement in the
embezzlement case, also may have been a factor in his disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   According to Russian documents obtained by The Times, Safiev was
deposed by Russian investigators in February 2000 in his hometown,
the Arctic mining city of Norilsk, in connection with the
disappearance of about $8 million from city accounts.</TE>
<TE>   A former deputy mayor of the city, Viktor Akatov, was charged with
misappropriating the funds. They had been earmarked to buy food and
medicine for schools for the winter of 1998 in the frigid city, which
is 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle.</TE>
<TE>   But after Akatov deposited the funds in Rossiysky Kapital, a
Moscow bank headed at the time by Safiev, the money disappeared.
Investigators believe that the funds were transferred to banks
outside Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev was chairman of the board of Rossiysky Kapital from June
until September 1998. The bank listed about $50 million in assets
that July. In August, Russia suffered a financial collapse that
bankrupted most of the country's banks, and in September, Safiev was
replaced as board chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Russian investigators say Safiev left the country shortly
thereafter. He eventually set up a film production company in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Akatov is believed to have fled Russia about the same time. In
January 2000, while Akatov was still at large, Russian investigators
subpoenaed Safiev. The investigators in Moscow and Norilsk then
received death threats by telephone, warning them to stay away from
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev appeared for his deposition in February 2000. In unofficial
remarks to investigators, he acknowledged that he had ordered the
threats and apologized for the harassment, the Russian law
enforcement source said.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't hide anything," the source said. "He made it clear that
with his connections, he could fix anything."</TE>
<TE>   At the time he was deposed, Safiev was officially considered a
witness in the embezzlement case, not a suspect. According to the
record of the deposition, investigators asked him about his
relationship with Akatov, Akatov's credit record and property
holdings, and how Safiev managed his money.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev said he had no property of his own outside Russia but
otherwise did not discuss his financial affairs.</TE>
<TE>   More than a year later, Akatov was arrested in Slovenia on an
Interpol warrant. He was extradited to Russia in February of this
year, according to the documents. When he was subsequently questioned
by Russian investigators, Akatov said he had deposited the funds in
good faith in Rossiysky Kapital and that they had been stolen by
Safiev.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators then began searching for Safiev, hoping to question
him again. That's when they learned that he had disappeared in
January and turned up dead in the New Melones Reservoir near Sonora
in March.</TE>
<TE>   With no evidence to disprove Akatov's version of events,
investigators freed him in June and closed their investigation.</TE>

<HD>Report Puts Number on Doctor's Toll</HD>
<DH>Britain: Inquiry finds 215 victims of Harold Shipman's
needle, but no explanation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>A church bell in the British town of Hyde tolled 215 times Friday,
once for each victim of the nation's worst serial killer, Dr. Harold
Shipman.</LD>
<LD>   The solemn chimes came on a new day of trauma for the town near
Manchester: A report for the first time put an official number on
Shipman's murders, providing certainty for the families of victims,
many of whom had suspected foul play.</LD>
<LD>   The report released Friday provides an intriguing and, at times,
repellent portrait of the doctor, who was adored by patients but had
few friends.</LD>
<TE>   The killing spree was a betrayal of trust "unparalleled in
history," said High Court Judge Janet Smith, chairwoman of the
inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   The man dubbed "Doctor Death" by British media killed 215 people
over 23 years, with another 45 suspicious deaths, the inquiry found.
But despite exhaustive investigation, one question went unanswered:
Why did this persuasive and trusted family doctor murder his patients
time and again?</TE>
<TE>   Smith said only Shipman can solve the mystery. She sent a copy of
the report to him in prison, where he is serving 15 life sentences,
in hopes of triggering a response from the man who has consistently
denied his guilt and refused to cooperate with police.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the way Shipman was able to kill, face the victims'
relatives and walk away so lightly would have been dismissed as
fanciful if described in a work of fiction.</TE>
<TE>   After killing, Shipman sometimes asked the family for an item
belonging to the victim: a sewing machine, which was given to him, or
a budgerigar--an Australian parakeet--which was not.</TE>
<TE>   "Deeply shocking though it is, the bare statement that Shipman has
killed over 200 patients does not fully reflect the enormity of his
crimes. As a general practitioner, Shipman was trusted implicitly by
his patients and their families," Smith told a news conference
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Shipman was convicted in 2000 of killing 15 people through lethal
injections of heroin. Friday's report investigated 888 cases and
found he killed 171 women and 44 men between 1975 and 1998. The
youngest victim was a 41-year-old man, the oldest a 93-year-old
woman.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the dose of heroin he administered would have been
enough to kill 360 people, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Shipman will not face further murder charges. The British
government recently confirmed that he would never be released from
prison, where he spends his time translating books into Braille.
British law does not allow the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The findings mean Shipman ranks alongside Colombian serial killer
Pedro Lopez, who is suspected of killing 300 girls.</TE>
<TE>   The closest Smith got to uncovering a motive was her suggestion
that Shipman, who was addicted to the painkiller pethidine in the
1970s, also might have become addicted to killing.</TE>
<TE>   The report rules out money as a motive in most of the cases.</TE>
<TE>   "There does not appear to have been any overtly sadistic or erotic
motivation for these crimes. In short, if one defines motive as a
rational or conscious explanation for the decision to commit a crime,
I think Shipman's crimes were without motive," Smith's report says.</TE>
<TE>   The Shipman murders rocked Britain. Relatives of the victims
angrily condemned the government's initial plans for a closed
investigation, forcing the public inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor enjoyed "almost celebrity status" among his patients,
the report says. One victim, Florence Lewis, was so delighted to be
accepted as his patient it was as if she had won the national
lottery, her son once said.</TE>
<TE>   But the report notes: "Many of the families of Shipman's victims
report that his usually kind and sympathetic attitude disappeared
when their relative had died. He would be curt and dismissive and
sometimes say the most inappropriate and hurtful things."</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after killing one woman in 1997, he told family
members: "Well, I don't believe in keeping them going."</TE>
<TE>   "Other well-marked traits of Shipman's personality were
aggression, conceit, arrogance and contempt for those whom he
considered to be his intellectual inferiors," the report says.
"Sometimes when he had killed a patient, Shipman was caught almost
red-handed. Yet he was able to invent an explanation for the death
without showing any noticeable discomfiture."</TE>
<TE>   Shipman's downfall came when he forged the will of his last known
victim, 81-year-old Kathleen Grundy. The forgery was obvious, and
police finally began to unravel the thread linking his murders.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's report speculates that perhaps Shipman was so out of touch
with reality that he thought himself untouchable, or perhaps he
subconsciously wished to draw attention to his crimes in order to
stop the killing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it likely that the conflict between whatever drove him to
kill and his fear of detection must have driven him to the edge of
breakdown," Smith concluded.</TE>

<HD>Test of Fire for Aging Aircraft</HD>
<DH>A Depression-era law keeps modern planes from being
deployed first to combat blazes. Two old tankers have crashed this
summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a wildfire raged below in the Cajon Pass, Tanker 152 swooped low
and dropped a load of orange fire retardant, wrapping up another
mission for the aircraft that first flew during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   The plane, a piston-powered DC-4, is part of the nation's motley
armada of air tankers, built during the Roosevelt, Truman and
Eisenhower administrations. This fleet of ragtag planes and their
bushwhacking pilots form the final line of defense against what may
be the worst onslaught of wildfires to scorch the Western states in
recent memory.</LD>
<LD>   The planes are unlike anything else used for public safety, a
quirk of a Depression-era law that has fueled a growing controversy
over their safety and effectiveness. As a result of the law, even
when newer air tankers are available, the older planes have to be
deployed first.</LD>
<TE>   Tanker 152 rolled out of the Douglas Aircraft Co. plant in Long
Beach in 1945 and later saw service during the Berlin airlift in
1948. It was in an Air Force museum by 1978 but was auctioned off and
ended up being used by a marijuana smuggler. After the Justice
Department seized the plane, it was acquired by an air tanker
operator in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like stepping back in time," said Ken Bavaro, a 31-year
veteran of the U.S. Forest Service, who as a ramp manager was
directing the aircraft to a refueling area at a San Bernardino
airport last month.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 100 such aircraft, mostly flown by private
operators, under government contract fighting wildfires across the
West. For about four months each year, these planes go from fire to
fire, landing at makeshift airfields to reload with retardant during
the course of performing a dozen or more drops a day.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the day after the crash of an air tanker that killed
its two-man crew, the Forest Service grounded for one day all 42 of
the heavy air tankers it manages.</TE>
<TE>   The ill-fated plane, a PB4Y-2 Privateer, was made by the former
Consolidated Aircraft Corp. in San Diego and used as a patrol bomber
by the Navy in World War II. It apparently broke apart in midair
while making a retardant drop in Colorado. It was one of six
Privateers still operating.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a 45-year-old C-130A went down when its wings tore off
during a retardant drop in the Eastern Sierra. The accident, which
killed three crew members, remains under investigation. About one
tanker crashes every year, making the missions among the more
dangerous in aviation. Since 1958, 152 crew members aboard airplanes
or helicopters have been killed while fighting fires.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots and industry officials say these aircraft are safe and
represent the most cost-effective way to fight forest and brush
fires. Cost savings are crucial, they say, particularly this year
when spending on firefighting is expected to top $1 billion, or about
double the usual outlay. Spending on aircraft operations typically
represents about a quarter of the budget for fighting wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   "The crews are responsive and cost effective and their aircraft
are well maintained and safe," said William R. Broadwell, director of
the Aerial Firefighting Industry Assn., which represents about 40
operators. "Nothing can compete with the existing commercial air
tanker fleet in either effectiveness or cost."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the age of the aircraft and how they are used have become
contentious issues among firefighters, pilots and politicians, some
of whom are calling for shuttering what they say is an outdated
system. The U.S. is unique in its dependence on commercial operators
for aerial firefighting, a legacy of Depression-era efforts to
support private business.</TE>
<TE>   For now, with so many wildfires raging this year, some airfields
are drawing classic-aircraft buffs, who come to see firsthand
aviation history coming back to life.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the aircraft still have gun turrets; others have cockpits
with cracked wooden flooring. The cabins in most are not pressurized,
and gauges are still analog. It's no wonder, then, that air tanker
pilots like to call them fire bombers instead.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft are used to drop retardant--a slushy chemical the
consistency of mud--in advance of a fire, whereas helicopters usually
drop water directly on the flames.</TE>
<TE>   For a few days last month, San Bernardino International Airport
resembled a World War II military operation as half a dozen air
tankers--piston engines rumbling and coughing black smoke--lined up
on a tarmac while waiting to take off. Another squadron of planes
descended toward the airport to reload fire retardants. They were
fighting a blaze that was sweeping through the Cajon Pass at the east
end of the nearby San Gabriel Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways it's a flying museum. You get to see some classics,"
Bavaro said as he directed a P-2 Neptune to a "mud pit" where it
would be reloaded with retardant. In its past life, the Korean
War-era aircraft was used by the Navy to patrol and drop torpedoes on
submarines.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how many such aircraft are being used today to fight
forest fires is unclear because each state may contract for a few.
Others are operated by local fire agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But the bulk--71 air tankers--are operated by private companies
under federal government contracts. The California Department of
Forestry, the state agency with the nation's largest nonfederal
fleet, operates 23 small air tankers, all of them former Navy
anti-submarine aircraft built in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The C-130A air tanker that crashed last month was one of the newer
air tankers in operation despite being manufactured in 1957. The
plane was initially used as an Air Force cargo plane before being
converted into a gunship during the Vietnam War. It eventually was
converted into a fire bomber by a private operator in Wyo- ming.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, new technologies are under development, including
equipment to spray retardants more efficiently. But for the
foreseeable future, the bulk of the aerial firefighting missions will
be carried out by aircraft older than their pilots, federal and state
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Change in Policy Pushed</TE>
<TE>   With forest fires promising to ravage and threaten national
landmarks, private homes and businesses at an unprecedented rate this
year, critics of the program have begun calling for the federal
government to rethink how it uses aircraft to fight fires. As of
Thursday, the National Interagency Fire Center had registered 49,363
fires this year. They destroyed 3.5 million acres, an area twice the
size of Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the debate is an arcane 1932 law that restricts
activating federal personnel and resources until all commercially
available firefighting aircraft have been used up.</TE>
<TE>   To keep costs down, private operators pick up aircraft that are
often discarded by the military services.</TE>
<TE>   "The current system is broken, and the nation can no longer afford
what has become an expensive, outdated sop to commercialism,"
Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, an influential industry magazine,
said in an unusually critical editorial last week. "The time has come
to throw away the ... statutes."</TE>
<TE>   Some veteran firefighting pilots say they have heard the debate
before and that it often ebbs and grows depending on the fire season
or when an air tanker crashes.</TE>
<TE>   The operators and their pilots insist that the aircraft are safe
and efficient. They note, for instance, that the planes have less
flight time on them than most passenger jets and do not undergo the
same grueling schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Age is not an issue," said Pat Norbury, a Forest Service pilot
who manages the program that trains pilots for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like an airliner that's got to fly six legs a day, day
after day, year after year. They are well maintained by the
operators. As dramatic as it looks, most of the time, you are not
flying the aircraft on the edge of its performance."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Rader, a Nevada pilot who flies Tanker 07, a P-2 Neptune that
first flew in 1953, said most of the air tankers have 5,000 to 20,000
hours of flight time. By comparison, Boeing 727 jetliners built in
the 1960s have flown more than 60,000 hours, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People always say, 'Wow, it was built in 1953,' but it doesn't
have that many hours on it," said Rader, who has been an air tanker
pilot for 17 years. "The Navy took really good care of them."</TE>
<TE>   Still, calls for modernizing the fleet have been growing, and some
members of Congress have pushed local initiatives to help bolster
federal programs.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the California Air National Guard's 146th Airlift Wing
in Ventura County, which is one of only four federal government units
designated to help fight wildfires, received the first newly
manufactured aircraft in its 80-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) secured $148.4 million in
federal funding last year to acquire the two new C-130J Hercules
cargo planes that would be equipped to drop retardants on wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   But the 146th, which uses the most powerful firefighting equipment
available, can be deployed only as a last resort because of the 1932
law. Irked lawmakers introduced legislation in Congress this week to
permit the Forest Service to tap military aircraft without first
exhausting the supply of commercial aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The Channel Islands Air National Guard Station near Point Mugu
also will be the home to the next generation of firefighting
equipment, which can dispense 4,000 gallons of retardant within five
seconds and with more accuracy. It's one of the few efforts to
upgrade aerial firefighting capabilities in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike current systems, which basically dump retardant from a tank
and rely on the vagaries of wind conditions for their accuracy, the
new system propels the retardant through a high-pressure valve,
releasing it much like a giant can of aerosol spray. Its designers,
Aero Union in Chico, said the system could double the effectiveness
of dropping retardants.</TE>
<TE>   The new system will not change the basics of carefully
choreographed fire bombing, as it is called.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas television broadcasts often show a single airplane making
a drop, the aerial operation may involve a dozen or more aircraft and
resemble the precision of a military operation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to air tankers, which range from C-130A cargo planes
that drop 3,000 gallons of retardant to smaller S-2A Trackers
carrying 800 gallons, the operation includes two other aircraft that
help guide the air tankers.</TE>
<TE>   Coordinating Operations</TE>
<TE>   A supervisor in a so-called air attack plane circles high above
the fire, coordinating operations and overseeing the dropping of
retardant.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a lead plane guides the air tankers through their runs
over the fire, typically about 150 feet above the ground. It then
circles back to guide the drop of the next tanker.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of states, including California, have their own small
fleets that are supplanted by aircraft owned by private operators
under contract with the federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Forestry operates 23 Grumman S-2T and
S-2A air tankers, nine UH-1H Super Huey helicopters and 13 OV-10A
Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   They can be deployed to virtually any forest fire in the state. In
1998, the agency converted a portion of San Bernardino Airport,
formerly Norton Air Force Base, into an air tanker facility.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the usually empty base began to bustle as a dozen air
tankers--two DC-4s, a C-130A, a P-2 Neptune and eight S-2
Trackers--flew in from their home bases to join in the fight against
the Cajon Pass fire.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the firefighting effort, each plane landed, took
on a new load of retardant and then took off, at least a dozen times.
Each flight lasted about 40 minutes, with the crews getting only
10-minute breaks on the ground between missions.</TE>
<TE>   "We operate the most expensive public safety equipment in the
world in one of the more hazardous environments," said Michael
Venable, an air tanker pilot who had made about 15 drops that day.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Dive as Investor Fear Sparks Widespread Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The Dow tumbles 390 points, while the S&amp;P and
Nasdaq hit five-year lows, defying hopes that prices had hit bottom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks plummeted Friday in record trading as more investors shifted
to panic mode after two years of losses.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street suffered one of its biggest one-day declines, driving
the Dow Jones industrials down 390.23 points, or 4.6%, to 8,019.26,
the lowest level since 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said more investors reached their threshold of pain after
nine weeks of almost unrelenting price declines that have driven many
well-known stocks to five-year lows.</LD>
<TE>   Shaken by the wave of corporate financial scandals this year, the
threat of more terrorist attacks and uncertainty over the strength of
the economic recovery, institutional and individual investors alike
have been abandoning stocks for the safety of Treasury bonds, bank
savings accounts and gold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just indiscriminate selling," said Liz Ann Sonders,
portfolio manager at New York-based money manager Campbell
Cowperthwait.</TE>
<TE>   The severity of Friday's decline raised concerns that Monday could
bring a fresh torrent of selling, after investors have had the
weekend to ponder their losses.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush made no mention of the market's
plunge Friday during a visit with U.S. soldiers at Ft. Drum, N.Y.,
but White House officials said he would address concerns about the
economy in his radio address to the nation this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to Friday's sell-off, the White House said Bush still
believes the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working with Congress to enact policies to strengthen the
economy, but the fundamentals are strong," White House spokeswoman
Claire Buchan said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, House and Senate negotiators signaled that they would
send a major accounting and finance reform bill to Bush by the end of
next week, moving with urgency to stiffen penalties for corporate
crimes and increase oversight of accountants.</TE>
<TE>   But none of that appeared to cheer investors Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street pros have argued repeatedly in recent weeks that the
market was reaching a "capitulation" phase as stocks plunged, and
that a bottom was likely soon, as investor gloom deepened.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can find a glimmer of hope, it's that this is usually how
bear markets finally end," Sonders said.</TE>
<TE>   But many more investors stepped up to sell Friday, raising new
fears that a bottom could be far off.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the market is being hit from all sides: Foreigners
are selling as the weak dollar devastates their U.S. holdings; hedge
funds and other active traders increasingly are "shorting" the
market, betting on lower prices; individual investors are selling out
of mutual funds; and fund managers are selling, trying to raise cash
in case redemptions accelerate.</TE>
<TE>   Losses have been most pronounced in the biggest blue-chip stocks
this week--a sign that many investors, professional and individual
alike, are getting rid of the last of their favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Though some say the pattern of dumping the strongest names may
indicate that selling is close to exhausting itself, investors have
grown weary of hearing analysts say in recent weeks that the decline
is almost over, only to see share prices fall further.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's slide was triggered in part by reports that drug giant
Johnson &amp; Johnson is facing a federal investigation of record-keeping
at a manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico. The news added to the cloud
over many big-name U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   As trading swelled, more than 3 billion shares changed hands on
the New York Stock Exchange and regional exchanges Friday, eclipsing
the previous peaks set in the aftermath of the September terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For the Dow, Friday's decline was the seventh-biggest in terms of
points, though it did not rank among the top 10 declines by
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 sank 3.8% to 847.75 and the
tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 2.8% to 1,319.15, both reaching new
five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P index now is down 44% from its peak in March 2000. The
Nasdaq index is down 74%.</TE>
<TE>   The focus now shifts to Monday, and whether more investors will
decide over the weekend that they can't bear any more pain.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dow breaking through its September lows is going to cause a
lot of people to say, 'That's frightening. I'm out of here,' " said
Chip Hanlon, editor of investing newsletter Unfundamentals.com in
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A huge wave of selling Monday could trigger trading halts on the
New York Stock Exchange for the first time, if the Dow falls as much
as 950 points.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what happens Monday, Hanlon said, several "classic
contrarian signals" suggest the market is reaching at least a
near-term bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Professional investors' sentiment has gotten extremely bearish, he
said. For instance, the latest Investors Intelligence survey of
market newsletter editors, issued this week, showed 39.6% were bears
and 35.4% were bulls, an unusual occurrence. The last time bears
outnumbered bulls was in September, preceding the powerful
fourth-quarter rally. The last time before that was in late 1998,
also around a market low.</TE>
<TE>   The current mood among average investors is bleak as well. Stock
mutual funds were hit with an $11.4-billion net outflow in the week
ended Wednesday, the heaviest this year, according to AMG Data
Services of Arcata, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "Our call volumes are high and the reaction is one of losing
patience with this market," Steve Norwitz, spokesman for mutual fund
company T. Rowe Price Group in Baltimore, said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "People are expressing shock, dismay and distrust, especially over
the larger companies."</TE>
<TE>   Norwitz said redemptions at the firm this month have been only
"moderately negative" because investors are reluctant to take losses
in what might turn out to be a bottoming phase. "But if the market
continues to slide, I expect some acceleration of the redemptions,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at brokerage RBC Dain
Rauscher in Minneapolis, said he is reminded of the 1973-74 downturn,
the worst postwar bear market, when "a lot of people gave up and
never came back. This is similar the way it's scaring the heck out of
everybody." The S&amp;P 500 fell 48% in that bear market.</TE>
<TE>   As prices continue to fall, part of the blame is put on
professional "short sellers"--traders who borrow stock and sell it,
hoping to buy it back on the cheap if the price goes down. A record
7.55 billion NYSE shares were sold short as of mid-July, up 5% from a
month earlier, the NYSE said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the biggest short sellers are hedge funds, freewheeling
investment vehicles that often chase high returns by placing momentum
bets on the direction of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists who focus on fundamentals and long-term investing say
the momentum approach exaggerates market swings in either direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Hedge funds helped drive the market to an irrationally exuberant
extreme" in the late 1990s, said Paul McCulley, chief economist for
Pacific Investment Management Co., a Newport Beach bond specialist
with $274 billion in assets under management. "And now, because of
their shorting abilities, they are driving it to an irrationally
pessimist extreme."</TE>
<TE>   McCulley is hardly alone in believing the market has been driven
to extremes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm bullish short-term. But I have been for two weeks, and of
course we're down even further," said James W. Paulsen, chief
investment officer of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
Paulsen said he thinks individual investors have been behind the
latest slide, either directly by selling in their brokerage accounts,
or indirectly by rebalancing their retirement accounts so that stock
mutual funds have been forced to sell large holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Despite signs of a "washout," Sonders warned that it can be
hazardous tp try to pinpoint the market's bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Dow agreed, saying, "The challenge is that this kind of a
psychological trend can be slow to change. Remember that on the
upside a few years ago, when all these young people were making
millions of dollars, it went on two years longer than expected."</TE>
<TE>   Psychology isn't the only hurdle facing the market, investment
pros say. Dow noted that dozens of companies have been lowering
revenue and profit guidance for the year's second half. And many
stocks remain highly valued, relative to earnings, even though share
prices have plummeted, experts warn.</TE>

<HD>Lake Elsinore Man Arrested in Girl's Kidnap, Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police say his DNA matches samples from the
5-year-old's body. Sheriff says he's '100% certain.'</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lake Elsinore man acquitted last year on child molestation charges
was arrested Friday in the kidnapping and slaying of 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion, with police officials saying they found his DNA in
samples taken from the girl's body.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro Avila, 27, emerged as the prime suspect over the last
two days after police received several tips suggesting that he might
be the killer. The tips were among more than 2,000 calls received
since Samantha was kidnapped Monday evening outside her condominium
in the northern Orange County city of Stanton.</LD>
<LD>   In a telephone interview early Friday before his arrest, Avila
denied any involvement in the girl's kidnapping and slaying. Avila
said he was at a shopping mall when the kidnapping occurred.</LD>
<TE>   The arrest came after detectives questioned Avila for 12 hours in
a Santa Ana hotel while crime-scene analysts searched his Lake
Elsinore apartment, just miles from where Samantha's body was found
in the Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "I am 100% certain that Mr. Avila is the man who kidnapped and
murdered Samantha Runnion," said Orange County Sheriff Michael
Carona. "Scientific evidence is embedded in that, but it is not the
only issue."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources said they were also drawn to Avila because
of his child-abuse case and his familiarity with Samantha's
condominium complex.</TE>
<TE>   Avila visited the Stanton complex because his ex-girlfriend's
9-year-old daughter lived there, according to the mother's relatives.
Avila was charged with molesting the 9-year-old and a second girl,
but a Riverside County jury last year found him not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Avila also resembles a sketch of the killer that was based on a
description provided by one of Samantha's playmates, a 6-year-old
girl who witnessed the kidnapping. She told police the assailant was
driving a green car, possibly a Honda or Acura. Avila owns a green
Ford Thunderbird.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's neighbors told police they noticed him meticulously
cleaning out his car Tuesday, police sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities released few details about their case, but police
sources said a preliminary DNA match is the prime piece of physical
evidence. More detailed DNA tests are expected to be completed in the
coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Avila said in the interview that detectives told him they found
fibers on Samantha's body that linked him to the slaying. Authorities
would not confirm this. During the questioning, officers also took a
sample of Avila's blood and photographed a scratch on his leg, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe Samantha scratched her abductor in a struggle to
escape. They said the assailant held Samantha for several hours after
the kidnapping, sexually assaulting and eventually asphyxiating her
sometime Tuesday. Her nude body was found in the open off a mountain
road, posed in such a way that the FBI said it amounted to a "calling
card" and a warning that the killer would strike again.</TE>
<TE>   Avila said he tried to cooperate with officers during questioning
Thursday but demanded an attorney when their tone turned hostile.</TE>
<TE>   "They were raising their voices," he said. "If I didn't know the
answer to a question, they wanted to know anyway."</TE>
<TE>   His family blamed a vindictive ex-girlfriend for pointing police
in Avila's direction.</TE>
<TE>   "She said she was going to get even with him," said Elvira Avila,
22, the suspect's sister. "Now I think she's trying to put this death
on him."</TE>
<TE>   Avila's sister said she could not say whether her brother could
have killed Samantha. She said she did not know where he was Monday
when Samantha was abducted. She said he returned home at 3 a.m.
Tuesday morning, when she buzzed him into the complex.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had proof he was with someone [when the crime was
committed], maybe he would not be where he is right now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's mother, Adelina Avila, said her son was at his apartment
most of Monday before leaving in the afternoon. She said she called
him on his cell phone at 8 or 9 p.m. Hearing planes in the
background, she said she asked him where he was and that he told her
he was going to the Ontario Mills shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   Officers spent much of Friday collecting evidence at Avila's
apartment, the nearby apartment of his mother and his workplace.
Investigators confiscated a computer, bedding, clothing, shoes,
telephone bills, garbage bags and other items. They impounded three
cars belonging to the family.</TE>
<TE>   The molestation accusations against Avila surfaced in late 1999.
The alleged victims were the daughter and niece of Avila's girlfriend
at the time, Elizabeth Ann Coker.</TE>
<TE>   Coker's foster brother, Lewis Davis, said his niece lives two
doors down from Samantha and is devastated by her death.</TE>
<TE>   "The little girl blames herself because they [she and Samantha]
were friends," he said. "The little girl thinks Avila was going to
her home to carry out a threat that he once made to her mother that
he would either kill her or her mother if she ever told about the
molestation."</TE>
<TE>   Officials Friday released an audiotape in which a distraught man
described discovering Samantha's body off Ortega Highway.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI profile of Samantha's killer suggested that he has molested
children before and could strike again soon. Carona said Friday that
they have not yet determined whether Avila had molested children in
the past or if he committed any more crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "As part of the ongoing investigation into his background, [we
will look at] what his motivations were, if he's done this before,"
Carona said.</TE>

<HD>Some Murdered Kids Get More Attention</HD>
<DH>News analysis: Race and class may play role, but some
insist Samantha's story merits coverage as parent's 'worst
nightmare.'</DH>

<LD>More than anything, some journalism and missing-child experts say, it
was the brutal and haunting details of Samantha Runnion's abduction
and killing that made her case an overnight media sensation.</LD>
<LD>   There was the brazen nature of the kidnapping, in broad daylight
on a quiet Orange County street. Then the discovery of the 5-year-old
girl's body by a hiker in the Cleveland National Forest, his anguish
captured on a 911 tape and played over and over on television. The
sheriff issued an unusual warning that a child killer was on the
loose and could strike again soon. And finally, Samantha's killer,
police said, had sexually assaulted and asphyxiated the girl, then
tauntingly left her displayed in the open as a "calling card." Even
her kicking and screaming hadn't been enough to deter her assailant.
Parents across the country wondered helplessly: What more can we do
to protect our children?</LD>
<LD>   "I hate this expression on television," said Jerry Nachman, an
MSNBC host, but "you have every parent's worst nightmare. This is not
a kid who didn't understand the rules, [but] one who is sitting on
the wall outside her house with a playmate and gets snatched by a
guy, dragged away from her home kicking and screaming, is sexually
abused and suffocated to death. How much of a reach is it to call
that a story?"</LD>
<TE>   But the prominent coverage given Samantha's case contrasts sharply
with all but a handful of other recent incidents of missing and
murdered children across the country. On Friday, as detectives
announced the arrest of 27-year-old Alejandro Avila in connection
with the case, some media professionals and other observers said that
factors such as ethnicity and economic class also may explain why
Samantha's story led national newscasts and captured front-page
headlines across the country, while many other recent cases of
missing and/or murdered children have not.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to, in the media, on the national level, place more
weight with children who are white, children who come from economic
circumstances that are middle or upper level, and we tend to dismiss
... children from personal situations that are too complicated or
messy," said Kelly McBride, a member of the ethics faculty at the
Poynter Institute, a journalistic think tank in St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   (Samantha Runnion fits the profile only partially. The child of a
single mother, Erin Runnion, she was from a working-class
neighborhood in Stanton.)</TE>
<TE>   Since the start of this year, at least five abducted children have
garnered varying degrees of national media attention. Besides
Samantha, they include Danielle van Dam, snatched from her bedroom in
her parents' San Diego home in February (David Westerfield, a
neighbor, is on trial for her murder); Alexis Patterson, 7, who
disappeared in May after leaving for school in central-city
Milwaukee; Elizabeth Smart, 14, who is feared to have been kidnapped
at gunpoint from her family's Salt Lake City home June 5; and Jahi
Turner, 2, who disappeared in San Diego in April.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five, Danielle, Elizabeth and Samantha were front-page news
across the country, and their cases have been given prominent play in
national TV newscasts. It's a mark of the impact of media saturation
that even many media executives rattle off the names of Danielle,
Samantha and Elizabeth, all of whom were white, and then tack on,
"and the girl from Milwaukee"--meaning Patterson, who is African
American, as is Turner. Neither case got immediate widespread
national attention, which led some to conclude that race and class
were at work when news executives were making their coverage
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Nachman disputes that, saying a number of factors in the Patterson
case, including confusion about custody, made it a murkier story.
"It's different circumstances," he said. But other executives say
race and class issues are involved in deciding which cases the media
will latch onto out of the several hundred nonfamily-member child
kidnappings per year.</TE>
<TE>   "It pains me, as a black man, a black journalist and as a
journalist," said Will Sutton, deputy managing editor of the News &amp;
Observer in Raleigh, N.C., and former president of the National Assn.
of Black Journalists. "Because for me it's a matter of accuracy,
balance and fairness as well as completeness."</TE>
<TE>   Sutton said that the News &amp; Observer ran its coverage of the
Runnion story inside its A section, as it has done with stories about
other recent child victims. "We tend not to put crime stories on the
front page and play them up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides journalists, some missing-child experts expressed concern
about disproportionate national reporting on stories like Samantha's.
"We wish that all the cases had equal coverage," said Nancy McBride,
executive director of the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited
Children/Florida in South Palm Beach.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she said that Samantha's case was unusually
potent psychologically, in part because of the audacity of her
attacker. "I think we need more resources devoted to prevention,
because even though the numbers are staying somewhat stable, the
attempts are more brazen," she said. "And that's very frightening."</TE>
<TE>   According to a number of sources, there are between 200 and 300
child murder-abductions annually by other than family members in the
United States, a number that has remained fairly steady for at least
the last decade. More than a million children go missing each year,
but the majority, perhaps as many as 90%, are estimated to be teenage
runaways.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around for 20 years and I can't remember the time when
we've had so many at once," Nancy McBride said. "But I've also
learned that, for whatever reason, these cases sometimes come in
clusters."</TE>
<TE>   David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research
Center at the University of New Hampshire, said that while the
dramatic content of Samantha's story accounts for the attention it
has received, sociological factors may also have played a role. "The
young age of the child is particularly dramatic," he said. But he
believes that "kids from minority, low-income, inner-city
environments, they just don't get the same amount of publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Others attribute the attention paid to the Runnion, Smart and Van
Dam cases to factors such as the willingness and ability of the
girls' parents to connect with the country through the mass media.
The Smart case had lots of compelling video and pictures of a child
from "what's considered a typical American family, middle-class or
upper middle-class," said Jim Murphy, executive producer of the "CBS
Evening News."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy had criticized his NBC News rivals recently for what he
considered excessive dwelling on the Smart kidnapping. But Wednesday
night, he led his broadcast with the Runnion case, while "NBC Nightly
News" chose to discuss a suicide bombing in Israel, Iraq, the economy
and the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission before getting to the
kidnapping. ABC's "World News Tonight" also led with the bombing,
then other news, before talking about the kidnapping 13 minutes into
the show.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hard decision for me to make," Murphy said, but he was
persuaded by arguments that "this case really affected people even
more than most because it came so soon after the Smart case and
because it was so unbearably grim. I didn't expect to lead with it
that day, but in the end, it felt like the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Slavin, executive producer of ABC's "World News Tonight,"
said the media have latched onto the story because "everybody who is
a parent, everybody who is thinking of becoming a parent, everybody
who knows a parent is terrified when this happens."</TE>
<TE>   Slavin said he didn't lead his broadcast with the story, however,
because "it was an interesting story, but it was not the most
important story of the day from our point of view."</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, several TV stations have preempted regular daily
talk shows and soap operas for live coverage of the Van Dam trial
since it began in early June. One station, KUSI, which is not
affiliated with any network and thus has more freedom to change its
schedule, has carried the trial virtually gavel-to-gavel, with an
additional one-hour special recapping events each night.</TE>
<TE>   The station, which promotes itself as having more local news than
competitors, decided on the blanket coverage, which could extend for
three months, "knowing that the Van Dam case was really important to
San Diego," said Joe Riddle, night executive producer. He compared it
to the O.J. Simpson trial, when viewers "said it was way too much but
then made it the highest-rated" programming.</TE>
<TE>   In its Thursday coverage of the Runnion case, CBS followed up with
a story that put child kidnappings in perspective, Murphy said,
adding that there is an "unjustified frenzy that happens with most of
these cases." Indeed, the recent clustering of kidnappings, just like
last summer's shark bites, may help create the appearance of a trend
where one may or may not exist. "I'm frequently going to say [that]
we in the business make generalizations out of aberrations," said
MSNBC's Nachman.</TE>
<TE>   Nachman, whose show focused extensively on the topic Thursday,
said the story might be unique in his three decades of crime
reporting. "When was the last time you saw a police official go on
television and flat-out announce that they're looking for a serial
rapist/serial killer and predict the guy's going to strike again in
24 hours?" he said.</TE>

<LD>The manhunt that would soon snare him was well underway earlier this
week when Alejandro Avila talked with his mother, Adelina, about the
slaying of Samantha Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   Whoever sexually assaulted and killed the little girl should hang,
the mother said.</LD>
<LD>   "What about the chair?" she recalls her son suggesting. "Who could
do a thing like that to a little girl?"</LD>
<TE>   Now police say they think they know.</TE>
<TE>   Their suspect is a man whose father went to prison for killing a
neighbor. His younger brother was murdered by what were believed to
be gang members in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He was accused--although not convicted--of molesting young girls,
including the daughter of his girlfriend, who later obtained a
temporary restraining order after reporting that he was stalking her.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's mother--who contends that the earlier molestation case was
based on false accusations by the girlfriend--insisted in an
interview that her son is innocent of the latest charge as well. "I
know my son, and I didn't raise him to be like that," she said. "He's
not capable of that. He's always good with kids."</TE>
<TE>   Yet interviews with other family members, former friends and court
records offer a more disturbing picture of the man authorities say is
the sexual predator who killed Samantha and then "posed" the
5-year-old Stanton girl's nude body in a rural Riverside County
ravine.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always been arrogant," said Lewis Davis, the foster brother
of Avila's ex-girlfriend, who accused him of molesting her 9-year-old
daughter in 1999. "He thinks he can get away with stuff. He never
thinks anyone can catch him."</TE>
<TE>   Avila's exposure to violence is the sort of background often seen
in sexual offenders, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "This hints at the kind of environment where normal social
controls were not well-developed," said Florida psychologist James
Hord.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, Avila was charged by Riverside County authorities
with molesting Elizabeth Ann Coker's 9-year-old daughter and the
daughter, also 9, of Coker's sister, Rosemary Drabek. Avila was also
charged with threatening to kill Drabek. The court file mentions an
alleged molestation against a third girl, but charges were never
filed.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives who interviewed Avila in 1999 said he was highly
cooperative and relaxed as he sipped a soda.</TE>
<TE>   "The tenor of the conversation," the detectives wrote in their
report, "revealed a person almost jumping at the chance to answer
questions, and taking the offensive during the conversation."</TE>
<TE>   In a follow-up session, detectives said Avila admitted he had
kissed and "tickled" both girls but said the kisses were not on the
mouth and the tickling wasn't sexual.</TE>
<TE>   After being released on bail, Avila allegedly followed Drabek, her
boyfriend and her three daughters to a movie theater. While watching
the film, Drabek's cell phone rang.</TE>
<TE>   "You're dead," said the voice, which Drabek said she recognized as
Avila's. Detectives traced the call to a pay phone in the theater
lobby.</TE>
<TE>   A jury found Avila not guilty. Superior Court Judge Robert G.
Spitzer said Friday he recalls there was little evidence besides the
children's account of what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's acquittal, though, haunts the prosector in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the guy was guilty and did everything I could to try and
get him convicted," said Riverside County Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul
Dickerson.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Coker's daughter lives with her father two doors from the
Runnions. Davis said he believes that is who Avila may have been
looking for Monday when Samantha was abducted.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a very good possibility he was there looking for
her and grabbed someone else instead," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Avila is the third of six children--three boys and three
girls--raised by Adelina and Rafael Avila. As a boy, Avila lived in
Bell Gardens. His dad was a butcher.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the family moved to Lake Elsinore, where Rafael Avila was
convicted of shooting a neighbor to death during a confrontation with
racial overtones.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Avila was 17 when his dad went to prison. His sister,
Elvira, said her mother would take the three girls to visit their
father at Chino and Lancaster state prisons, where he did time. The
three boys, however, would rarely go.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the elder Avila was released in December 2000 and put
on a bus to Tijuana, where he still lives and runs a restaurant,
contact with his sons--particularly Alejandro--was rare, his sister
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad only speaks Spanish," she said, adding that her brother
speaks little of it, although authorities said Samantha's abductor
had a Spanish accent.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, Avila's brother, Juan, was found dead in Rosarito,
a bullet in the back of his neck. The family believes he was killed
by members of his own gang.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, you just have to block it out," Elvira Avila said of
her family's violent history.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Avila divided his time between his mother's and sister's
apartments in a Lake Elsinore complex only miles from where
Samantha's body was found.</TE>
<TE>   At his sister's place, Avila bunked on an inflatable mattress on
the floor. Neighbors described him as a loner.</TE>
<TE>   Avila had a membership at Video Shores, a store near his
apartment. Records there show he rented mostly comedies--but also
children's movies and pornographic films. On Dec. 26, he rented a
pair of X-rated titles on the same day he took out "The Emperor's New
Groove," a children's movie.</TE>
<TE>   Avila worked on the assembly line at a Temecula plant owned by
Guidant, an Indianapolis-based company that makes pacemakers and
other medical devices, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   His family said he was off Sunday through Wednesday of this
week--the time during which Samantha was abducted and killed.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's resume is much like his family history: messy.</TE>
<TE>   He held down a variety of odd jobs, Davis said. He was fired as a
clerk from an AM/PM mini mart in Lake Elsinore.</TE>
<TE>   He took a job at Wal-Mart--and was fired again for driving wildly
in the parking lot with a security car.</TE>
<TE>   Avila then went to work for Professional Hospital Supply in
Temecula, but was fired about a year ago, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Avila and Coker were together for two turbulent years, during
which Avila threw things at Coker, including a telephone, according
to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, 'You gotta get out of there. You gotta leave him,' "
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Coker eventually got a restraining order against Avila, Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept thinking that if he could just talk to her, he could get
her back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But she didn't want to go back."</TE>

<HD>New AIDS Office Chief Is Named</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House announced Friday that Joseph O'Neill is taking over
as head of President Bush's office on AIDS policy, replacing an
openly gay director whose activism rankled some conservatives.</LD>
<LD>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer issued a statement
naming O'Neill, an openly gay physician who is acting head of the
office of AIDS and HIV policy in the Department of Health and Human
Services, as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy.</LD>
<LD>   Outgoing director Scott Evertz, the first openly gay person
nominated to an executive branch office by a Republican president,
was shifted to HHS.</LD>
<TE>   He will serve as special assistant to Secretary Tommy G. Thompson
"to assist in further developing and implementing the department's
overall strategy to fight HIV/AIDS around the world, including the
Global Fund to Fight HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria," according to a
statement from HHS.</TE>
<TE>   In that statement, Evertz said: "I am thrilled to be able to help
the administration address the global pandemic in this new capacity,"
seeming to put to rest speculation by activists at the Human Rights
Campaign that he was forced out by conservatives who did not like his
association with gay groups and his support of condom use to prevent
the spread of AIDS and HIV.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan also contradicted the notion
that Evertz did anything wrong. "We are pleased with the job Scott
Evertz has been doing in our effort to combat HIV/AIDS and look
forward to working with him in his new high-level position at HHS."</TE>
<TE>   Winnie Stachelberg, political director at Human Rights Campaign,
said the gay rights group is "cautiously hoping that these
[personnel] moves will reinvigorate the Bush administration's efforts
to create a comprehensive HIV and AIDS strategy to battle the disease
at home and abroad."</TE>
<TE>   "This is an opportunity for the administration to reverse course,
take this life-and-death issue off the back burner and reassert
American leadership," Stachelberg said.</TE>

<HD>Anthrax Field Tests Called Unreliable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House is warning that anthrax field tests, widely used
since last fall's terrorist attacks, give fast but often incorrect
results, prompting authorities to shut down buildings prematurely and
hand out unneeded antibiotics.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo being sent Monday to more than 250 federal agencies and
to firefighters, police officers and local officials across the
country, authorities say none of the commercially available field
tests are reliable. They advise federal agencies to stop using them
and to cancel any pending contracts to purchase the test kits.</LD>
<LD>   The advisory comes after an extensive study of the tests by the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the FBI. The
study found that all tests on the market are prone to miss small
amounts of anthrax and to detect anthrax when there is none.</LD>

<LD>Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) will testify under oath to the Senate
ethics committee in its investigation of allegations that he accepted
gifts from a New Jersey businessman in return for official favors.</LD>
<LD>   The closed-door appearance will mark the first time that he will
answer committee questions regarding allegations made by now-jailed
businessman David Chang.</LD>
<LD>   In January, the U.S. attorney's office in New York dropped its
criminal investigation of Torricelli's finances, his fund-raising
practices and his relationship with Chang, and referred the matter to
the Senate ethics panel.</LD>

<LD>After months of legal drama and summits of Roman Catholic leaders on

will gather in Boston today to offer their solution and a perspective
from the pews.</LD>
<LD>   "In Rome the pope spoke, and in Dallas the bishops spoke and in
Boston the laity is going to speak," said Jim Post, president of
Voice of the Faithful, which is hosting its first national

<LD>A judge in Buffalo ordered the retrieval of hair, blood, saliva and
handwriting samples from a man awaiting trial for the 1998 slaying of
a doctor who provided abortions.</LD>
<LD>   The judge also granted a prosecution request that James Kopp,
known in militant antiabortion circles as "Atomic Dog," should submit
to a police lineup.</LD>
<LD>   The defense argued that a lineup would be prejudicial because
Kopp, who's already been fingered by witnesses in a photo-array
exhibit, is far too widely known after a 2 1/2-year international
manhunt.</LD>

south of Salt Lake City, an uncle of the girl said.</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Smart, 14, was kidnapped on June 5 at gunpoint from her
bedroom at her family's million-dollar home. A former handyman,
Richard Albert Ricci, 48, has been a possible suspect in the girl's
disappearance but has not been officially charged in the case, police
have said.</LD>

<HD>Bush Cheers Troops, Says More Missions Are 'Yet to Come'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FT. DRUM, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Friday lavishly praised members of the Army's
storied 10th Mountain Division, among the first units deployed in
Afghanistan, while telling them their services "will be in need
again--in missions yet to come."</LD>
<LD>   With an eye to future engagements in the war on terrorism, Bush
also urged Congress to quickly pass his request for a large boost in
the Defense Department's budget. And he reiterated his
administration's intention to act preemptively against U.S. enemies
who have sought to develop weapons of mass destruction--language
aimed mainly at Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "To ignore this mounting danger is to invite it," Bush said,
without specifying any nation. "America must act against these
terrible threats before they're fully formed. We will use diplomacy
when possible, and force when necessary. We will prepare
deliberately, and act decisively."</LD>
<TE>   The president's forceful restatement of his policy came amid
rising calls in Congress--including by some Republicans--for a full
debate before a decision is made to take on Iraq. So far, the
administration has given little hint of its specific strategy or
timetable for trying to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's audience made its position clear. As he spoke, someone
shouted: "Let's get Saddam!"</TE>
<TE>   The remark elicited sustained applause from the crowd of more than
5,000 soldiers and their families--and a faint smile from Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also restated his strong opposition to U.S. participation in
the new International Criminal Court, the subject of ongoing
negotiations at the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not submit American troops to prosecutors and judges
whose jurisdiction we do not accept," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   After a heated debate with many of its allies at the U.N., the
U.S. recently gained a one-year exemption from the court's
jurisdiction. The court was set up to try cases of genocide, war
crimes and gross human rights abuses that are not prosecuted by the
suspects' own countries.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was clearly buoyed by the reception he received from a sea of
flag-waving, black beret-clad troops here--a welcomed respite from
the Capitol's focus on the past business practices of administration
officials, including himself, and potential political problems caused
by a falling stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Bush had no public comments as the market suffered large losses
Friday, but he plans to discuss the economy in his weekly radio
address today.</TE>
<TE>   Before addressing the outdoor gathering, Bush went to nearby
Sexton Field, where he reviewed the maps and weaponry used by GIs
around the world, including in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He also watched an action-packed reenactment of troop movements in
Afghanistan, as two Chinook helicopters appeared over a tree line and
swooped down on the field, depositing about 20 heavily armed
infantrymen before quickly taking off.</TE>
<TE>   Then two Black Hawk helicopters appeared, each carrying a
105-millimeter howitzer on long steel cables. They deposited the big
guns on the field and departed as six-member artillery teams ran over
and swung the barrels in the direction of the trees in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   The teams fired each weapon three times, using blank rounds. The
teams then raced across the field, joined by infantrymen who had been
lying in the grass with their weapons at the ready.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers converged directly in front of the president, forming
a semicircle two soldiers deep.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of you guys," Bush told them. "The enemy made a bad
mistake. They didn't understand you all. They didn't understand us.
We're staying after them until we get all of them."</TE>
<TE>   As he does unfailingly whenever he talks about the war on
terrorism, Bush counseled patience. "In Afghanistan, coalition troops
still have critical work," he said. "And the dangers haven't passed.
Elsewhere, new threats are taking shape."</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not elaborate on the latter comment. But in his speech,
he clearly had Iraq in mind as he condemned nations that seek weapons
of mass destruction and try to conceal them from international
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Such regimes, Bush said, "have shown their true nature by
torturing and butchering their own people"--a description he has used
before to describe Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Against such enemies, he said, "we cannot sit quietly and hope for
the best."</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, members of the 10th Mountain Division were dispatched
to Bagram air base near Kabul, the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush noted, the infantry soldiers cleared more than 100 Al
Qaeda caves, seized more than 500 stockpiles of enemy ammunition,
patrolled about 500 miles of trails to block terrorists and their
supporters from fleeing, and delivered more than a million pounds of
food.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is working on a defense spending bill for the 2003 fiscal
year likely to total about $355 billion. The more heated debate is
likely to occur over a separate defense authorization bill, which
outlines how the money can be spent. There, the Democrats who control
the Senate and the dominant Republicans in the House disagree about
an array of issues.</TE>

<HD>Jordanian Held in Detroit After Phony $12 Million
Confiscated</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Customs finds the fake cashier's checks in
luggage, raising fears that the detainee, who is linked to Al Qaeda,
was trying to fund attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>A Jordanian-born man federal authorities say carried $12 million in
phony cashier's checks on a flight to Detroit Metropolitan Airport
will remain in custody at least until next week, following a hearing
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Shishani, 47, appeared in U.S. District Court for the
detention hearing, which was postponed until Wednesday after federal
public defender Andrew Wise told Magistrate Steven Pepe that he
needed more time to prepare</LD>
<LD>   Counter-terrorism officials told the Washington Post that the
suspect may have been trained in Al Qaeda terrorist camps in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials said the name Shishani appears on a watch list of
people trained in Afghanistan by Al Qaeda. Shishani's name turned up
in documents captured in Afghanistan, sources told the Post.</TE>
<TE>   "It has really alarmed a lot of people that Al Qaeda may be trying
to get that much money into the United States for operational
purposes," said one official. "We don't know what he was up to, but
he was coming from Indonesia, he had $12 million in bogus checks ...
he was born in Jordan and his family is from Chechnya. There is a lot
of smoke there to investigate."</TE>
<TE>   Agents of the U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force in Detroit executed
a search warrant Thursday night at Shishani's home in Dearborn,
Mich., where he lives with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Wise, Shishani's court-appointed federal defender, declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shishani was carrying a U.S. passport and told authorities he is a
naturalized U.S. citizen, officials said. Eric Straus, an assistant
U.S. attorney on the Detroit anti-terrorism task force, said Shishani
was born in Jordan and is of Chechen descent. Other sources said
Shishani had served in the Jordanian army.</TE>
<TE>   Public records show Shishani previously lived in San Francisco and
Napa. At his arraignment Friday, he described himself as a salesman
who had earned no commissions this year. He said his wife is a
documented immigrant from Japan and works for Northwest Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence officials said possibly hundreds of Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters who escaped from Afghanistan had gone to Indonesia,
making the nation a haven for the terrorist movement.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sept. 11 attacks only cost $500,000 in total," said one
official, who acknowledged that authorities have no idea how the
bogus checks were going to be used. "One shudders to think what they
could do with $12 million."</TE>
<TE>   Officials noted that counterfeit cashier's checks and other
monetary instruments are used in a wide variety of criminal
activities and scams unrelated to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Laster, a special agent of the Secret Service who signed
an affidavit presented at Shishani's arraignment, said he had learned
of checks similar to Shishani's being passed near Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "I was informed that several people had been arrested for
attempting to pass similar checks there, and it had been determined
that the cashier's checks were counterfeit," Laster said.</TE>
<TE>   A federal investigator said that, in addition to having Shishani's
name on a watch list, U.S. officials may have been tipped that he was
carrying the checks. Customs agents searched his bags and found nine
cashier's checks: two for $5 million each, two for $500,000 each and
five for $200,000 each. Six of the checks were posted for June and
one for September of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrest of Omar Shishani and the seizure of $12 million in
counterfeit cashier's checks by U.S. customs officials in Detroit
demonstrate the effectiveness of U.S. border security systems and the
improved interagency coordination since Sept. 11," the Customs
Service said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Knowledgeable officials said the checks were extremely well made
and indicated they were issued by the Pomona branch of West America
Bank. Laster said in the affidavit that West America does not have a
Pomona branch, which a bank official confirmed in an interview. In
addition, the bank spokesman said, the checks bore the words
"cashier's check" while the bank uses the words "official check" on
its checks.</TE>
<TE>   "They fool you when you look at them. They were very nicely done,"
said one official. "They put work and research into making them. It
was first-rate work."</TE>
<TE>   Financial investigators said criminals deposit bogus cashier's
checks in a bank account, which could give the depositor immediate
access to the money before the checks have formally cleared.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Shishani was initially stopped and asked if he
was carrying any undeclared cash or monetary instruments. When he
said no, he was taken to a secondary inspection area where he was
asked again, responding that he had only the cash in his wallet. At
that point, Shishani's bags were searched, the checks were found and
he was detained, officials said.</TE>

<DH>History: The House Elm was to be razed for a parking lot
while a visitors center is built. But two congressmen stepped in to
save it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA FACKLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The stately English elm has held sway over the east lawn of the U.S.
Capitol for close to two centuries.</LD>
<LD>   So last month, when Reps. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) and
Charles F. Bass (R-N.H.) heard that the tree--the oldest on the
Capitol grounds and known as the House Elm--might be sacrificed to
make way for temporary parking while crews worked on a new visitors
center, they made the elm's welfare a personal mission.</LD>
<LD>   Since work began last fall on the $265-million Capitol Visitors
Center, tourists and congressional staffers have watched as
bulldozers cleared the ground for construction to begin on the
underground facility. The work has slowly undone a portion of the
original work of famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted,
though much of it will be restored.</LD>
<TE>   The center--which will feature exhibits, theaters and shops--is
the largest addition to the Capitol grounds in the history of the
complex, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Before construction began, lawmakers were told that historic
fixtures such as fountains, lanterns and trees would be removed and
some later replaced, Bass said. But Bass and Frelinghuysen said many
lawmakers were surprised to hear that the House Elm was in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   Frelinghuysen brought the issue to the House floor last month,
gaining the support of lawmakers including Rep. Robert W. Ney
(R-Ohio), chairman of the Committee on House Administration. The
House took steps to ensure greater oversight and protection for the
tree.</TE>
<TE>   "We were obviously outraged at the idea that they would cut the
tree down for lazy congressmen to have a place to park," Bass said.
"You can remove any amount of bricks and blocks and steel, but once
you saw the tree down, that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, a quick assessment by a tree company determined that
the tree was in poor condition because of its age but did not
recommend its removal, said Tom Fontana, a spokesman for the visitors
center. A more thorough analysis last spring by the same company
confirmed its condition and recommended it be taken down.</TE>
<TE>   Another independent consultant offered further confirmation of the
condition of the elm, which Fontana described as "in the winter of
its life." But the consultant agreed with the architects that,
because of its historical significance, the tree should be preserved.
"The elm was never even considered to be on the chopping block,"
Fontana said.</TE>
<TE>   "All the arborists concur that the tree is in decline and that it
needs to be secured and protected because of its proximity to the
construction site," he said. "And that's what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   After receiving a letter last week from the architect of the
Capitol assuring them that the "tree will be protected during and
after the construction" of the center, Bass and Frelinghuysen are
optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   The elm is now enclosed in fencing near the opening of the site
and surrounded by a 75-foot mulch bowl and irrigation system. Over
the last several months, its upper branches have been pruned and its
lower branches will be secured with cabling as the project advances.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers said poor communication between Congress and the
architect about the project complicated matters. To help remedy that,
Fontana said, information boards were posted for members on the House
side of the Capitol last week to update them on the project. He said
he was "pleasantly surprised" at the response.</TE>
<TE>   Although plans for the visitors center have existed for years, the
funding was approved as part of the homeland security legislation
enacted after Sept. 11, in order to increase the management and
security of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of [Congress] probably agrees that it's long overdue,"
Fontana said. The visitors center is scheduled to be completed in
2005.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the construction has made for a bit of chaos near
the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an [awful] mess, and it's going to be that way for the next
couple of years," Frelinghuysen said.</TE>
<TE>   Walking past the tree on her way back from lunch recently, Kate
Spaziani, a legislative assistant to Rep. Marion Berry (D-Ark.), said
the work "definitely detracts from the tourist experience right now,
but hopefully it will be worth it. It's kind of funny--with all the
heightened security, they've got big trucks coming in here and no one
seems to know where to go."</TE>
<TE>   But at least for the time being, the House Elm is going nowhere.</TE>

<HD>House Panel Votes to Extend Deadline on Baggage Screening</HD>
<DH>Security: Year's delay is urged in GOP plan, which cites
problems faced by major airports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>House Republicans pushed Friday to extend by one year the legal
deadline for installing bomb detection machines to scan baggage at
the nation's airports.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, added to a bill to create a Department of
Homeland Security, the current deadline of Dec. 31 for installing the
machines would be pushed back one year.</LD>
<LD>   A bipartisan House leadership panel approved the proposal on a 6
to 3 vote, with Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas) joining five Republicans
in favor.</LD>
<TE>   The panel's action gave fresh evidence of mounting troubles for
the government's aviation security initiative. This week, the first
head of the Transportation Security Administration was forced to
resign amid widespread complaints about the agency's performance
since its launch earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the Republican proposal said major airports across
the country face huge difficulty meeting the ambitious bag-screening
deadline set when overwhelming majorities in Congress voted last year
to federalize airport security. They also said that if the current
deadline is kept, airports may be forced to buy large, expensive
bomb-detection machines that will soon be outdated.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. J. C. Watts Jr. (R-Okla.), who brokered the proposal, called
the year-end 2002 deadline "totally unrealistic." Watts and others
said airports need to be given a chance to find and install the best
bomb-screening technology while imposing the least hassle on
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said Congress had
misjudged when it set the Dec. 31 deadline. He predicted major
airports in Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas and elsewhere would be unable to
comply with the bomb-detection requirement by year's end. He said a
deadline extension is "the right and necessary thing."</TE>
<TE>   Three leading Democrats on the committee denounced the proposal.
Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said it broke faith with a jittery
public that expects the government to tighten air security flaws
exposed by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the high political stakes involved in security
decisions, the GOP proposal generated a sharp exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope you would not think I'm going to put anybody at
risk, including my three wonderful kids," Watts said, noting that his
family travels by air frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Menendez replied: "It saddens me too that my family, my
neighborhoods and my constituents are at risk--because that's what
this amendment does."</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear what position the Bush administration
would take on the proposed deadline extension. This month,
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta told lawmakers the
government is committed to meeting all of its aviation security
mandates.</TE>
<TE>   Baggage screening was just one friction point Friday in a
wide-ranging debate about the security department President Bush
proposed last month.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of a daylong review, the House Select Committee on
Homeland Security approved on a party-line vote of 5 to 4 a bill that
would authorize the most significant reorganization of the government
in more than 50 years. Democrats were incensed about
Republican-crafted provisions on federal employee relations, tort
reform and other matters.</TE>
<TE>   The select panel, made up of party leaders, was formed to assemble
a homeland security bill after taking recommendations from a dozen
House committees, from Agriculture to Ways and Means.</TE>
<TE>   With the panel's approval, the legislation to implement President
Bush's homeland security plan now moves to the House floor. There,
lawmakers are expected to stage a lengthy debate next week with
several potentially divisive amendments. Meantime, a Senate committee
is moving ahead with its own version that differs in several
respects.</TE>
<TE>   While it is unclear how fast the Senate will act, passage of the
bill in the House does not appear to be in doubt. The House
Republican leadership is likely to draw at least a simple majority
for its proposal.</TE>
<TE>   But it remains to be seen whether the House bill will draw the
sort of overwhelming bipartisan support that other anti-terrorism
bills have enjoyed in the months since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Criticizing the Republican bill as a "step backwards," House
Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) promised a floor fight
to amend it.</TE>
<TE>   Armey, who drafted the bill, called for bipartisanship as Congress
weighs a new Cabinet department that would draw an estimated 164,000
employees from 22 different federal agencies, including the Coast
Guard, Customs Service, Transportation Security Administration, and
Immigration and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we are committed to arriving at the same destination,
we will in fact arrive together," Armey said.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican bill would split the INS, sending border protection
units to homeland security and leaving immigration services in the
Justice Department. That is a major departure from the Bush
blueprint, which would move the INS intact to the new department.
Most of the rest of the bill tracks the administration's
recommendations. Rep. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Bush was "pleased
with where we ended up."</TE>
<TE>   On the proposed structure of the department, leading Democrats
offered no major quarrels. But partisan splits were clear on several
issues. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Republicans approved a personnel management plan that they said
would give the new department flexibility to hire and promote the
best employees, while preserving core worker rights. Democrats said
the plan failed to include adequate protections for federal
employees.</TE>
<TE>   * Republicans pushed through a proposal to limit liability for
businesses with products connected to homeland security. Democrats
opposed the measure as an attempt to win tort reform through the
homeland security bill.</TE>

<DH>Terrorism: Agents are checking possible links between local

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The brawny man in the Muslim skullcap gestured toward a brick
apartment building across the street from where he was standing guard
at a shelter for homeless families.</LD>
<LD>   "See that window over there?" said the man, Abdul-Hakim, pointing
to an upper floor. "The FBI watches me from that window."</LD>
<LD>   The FBI will not comment. But a federal investigation of a
possible terrorist cell in the Pacific Northwest is focusing on a
group of African American converts to Islam, possibly opening a new
chapter in the domestic war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Across the nation, court papers suggest that FBI anxiety about
radical African American Muslims has reemerged in the last decade as
the bureau has concentrated on Islamic terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigations into the World Trade Center bombing in 1993
and a related plot to blow up New York landmarks discovered the names
of black Americans associated with the "blind sheik," Omar Abdel
Rahman, now serving a life term for his part in the bombing
conspiracy. Among those convicted in the same plot was U.S.-born
Rodney Hampton-el, a former New York clinic worker and ex-moujahedeen
volunteer in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "FBI scrutiny of African American Muslims has clearly increased
since the [1993] World Trade Center bombing," said Ihsan Bagby, a
professor at Shaw University in North Carolina who has studied the
nation's Muslims. "A lot of this is a combination of a focus on
terrorism and an agenda about black 'radicals' and Muslims--all
lumped together."</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle investigation turns on the notion that foreign
terrorists may have recruited on U.S. soil among African American
Muslims, and may even have sponsored a "jihad training camp" in the
Oregon backcountry with U.S. collaborators. Law enforcement documents
obtained by The Times say that an American man who worshiped at one
of the mosques here may have served as a liaison for recruits seeking
entry into Afghan terrorist training camps. In addition, documents
show, he and his brother were suspected of scouting targets "for a
terrorist operation" during a road trip back to Seattle last month.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry has sent a shudder through a small, insular community
whose members view themselves as having worked hard to banish crack
dealers from their block.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Hakim says he worshiped with the two brothers. He said
neither the brothers nor anyone else associated with the case ever
advocated violence or terrorism. Most, if not all, strongly opposed
U.S. policy in the Middle East, Abdul-Hakim said, but none ever
preached violence.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to figure out what Al Qaeda is," said
Abdul-Hakim. "Muslims are under attack worldwide. Why are Muslims the
only people not allowed to train in self-defense?"</TE>
<TE>   The specter of terrorism also surfaced in the case of Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin (formerly H. Rap Brown, the onetime black power
firebrand), a charismatic Muslim convert who received a life sentence
in Atlanta this spring for killing a sheriff's deputy in a shootout.
The FBI investigated Al-Amin as a suspected terrorist in the years
after the World Trade Center bombing, but Al-Amin was never charged.</TE>
<TE>   The movement founded by Al-Amin may be indirectly linked to the
case in Seattle. The mosques in question here were said to have at
least an informal affiliation with his group.</TE>
<TE>   Like the great majority of African American Muslims, neither the
Atlanta nor Seattle groups were affiliated with the Nation of Islam
and its leader, Louis Farrakhan, who promotes a black nationalist
agenda. Instead, the Muslims now drawing federal attention attend
mosques espousing a pro-Islam philosophy widely shared in the Muslim
world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the policy of the FBI to investigate mosques or any
other religious institution," said Charles Mandigo, the FBI chief in
Seattle. "Any investigations that the FBI may be conducting would be
based on the actions of individuals and not their religion, national
origin, race, or any other such characteristics."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the disquieting scenario of home-grown terrorist
recruits has set off alarms. A confidential FBI alert on the Seattle
case last month was sent to field offices--as well as to the White
House, CIA, State Department and other assorted government agencies.
A copy was obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The two brothers apparently targeted in the Seattle case--who had
not previously been publicly identified--issued a news release on
Monday denying any links to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The release identified the pair as James and Mustafa Ujaama.
According to the FBI document, they were born in Denver, reared in
Seattle and their given names and ages are Earl James Thompson, 36,
and Jon Alexander Thompson, 34.</TE>
<TE>   "These two gentlemen are community activists, not terrorists,"
declared Ron Sims, the King County executive, who is the
highest-ranking African American elected official in the state of
Washington. "It's the McCarthy era all over again," said Charlie
James, who heads a group called the Organization of African American
Unity and who issued the news release on behalf of the brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Neither brother has been charged with a crime, and neither has
been questioned by the FBI, but both have been subject to
considerable surveillance, the law enforcement documents indicate.</TE>
<TE>   The two brothers, along with others under scrutiny, worshiped at
several now-defunct storefront mosques just east of downtown Seattle
that have been tied to Semi Osman, an immigrant of apparent Lebanese
origin, who served as an imam, or prayer leader. Osman, 32, is a car
mechanic and U.S. Navy reservist and is the only person known to have
been arrested in the inquiry. He was charged with immigration and gun
violations, but his attorney, Robert M. Leen, said the government is
pressuring Osman to tell all about former acquaintances as part of
the terrorism investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A search warrant executed at Osman's home turned up several
weapons, anti-U.S. Islamic literature, military maps and
"instructions on poisoning water sources," according to the federal
law enforcement document. Leen said he had seen no evidence that
water-poisoning directions were seized.</TE>
<TE>   Acquaintances describe the two brothers targeted by the FBI as
hard-working fathers with small children. The younger sibling lives
in Seattle and makes his living as a mechanic and used-car salesman.</TE>
<TE>   The older brother is an "entrepreneur" based in London, according
to Charlie James. The older brother has written and privately
published several inspirational books aimed at young African
Americans. One book is called "The Young People's Guide To Starting a
Business Without Selling Drugs."</TE>
<TE>   The older sibling also is reported to be the founder of
stopamerica.org, a Web site harshly critical of U.S. actions abroad.
The site lists offices in London; Karachi, Pakistan; and at an
unspecified address on south Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "America's foreign policy makers have brought hate to the people
of the United States," E.J. Ujaama states in a "founder's message" on
the site. "We the people of the United States charge this government
and their coalition with conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes of
terrorism against Muslim people in our names."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the FBI inquiry has zeroed in on the elder
brother's supposed relationship with Abu Hamza al-Masri, a militant
London-based sheik whom U.S. authorities regard as a recruiter for Al
Qaeda. The FBI document states that the American "worked for and
provided services to" the cleric, including taking computers to the
Taliban before the U.S. invasion.</TE>
<TE>   According to the FBI document, the asserted "jihad training camp"
was carried out in November 1999 "in concert with" Hamza al-Masri at
a ranch in the secluded community of Bly, in south-central Oregon.
The London sheik, whose Finsbury Park mosque is a center of radical
Islam in Europe, has denied any connection.</TE>
<TE>   The two brothers did travel to Bly, James conceded, but he said
the trip was for recreational "practice shooting," not for terrorism
training. The FBI is attempting to determine who visited the site.</TE>
<TE>   The wide-ranging investigation based here may have arisen from
intelligence gleaned from interrogations of prisoners at the U.S.
military lockup at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the documents cite the case of a British citizen,
Feroz Abbasi, who was captured in December by U.S. forces while
allegedly defending the former Taliban stronghold of Kunduz. U.S.
authorities state that the elder of the Seattle brothers introduced
Abbasi "to individuals at Al Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan," thus
enabling his "matriculation" into a "terror training camp."</TE>
<TE>   Now, in Seattle, "the FBI is watching all the time," said
Abdul-Hakim, the mosque member.</TE>
<TE>   By Abdul-Hakim's account, the Muslims at the mosques in question
here adhered to ostensibly mainstream teachings of Islam, worshiping
alongside immigrants from Africa, Asia and elsewhere who have arrived
in recent years. Along with providing spiritual guidance, the mosques
take an active role in helping to purge the area of crack purveyors
and other criminals, which occasionally results in conflicts with
drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   One of the mosques ran afoul of the clientele of a bar-poolroom a
few doors down. At some point, according to police, officers
responding to a report of an assault were told weapons had been
stored in the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Worshipers maintained that the arms were for self-defense against
drug dealers and others; the weapons may have been placed there by
unauthorized mosque visitors, according to Abdul-Hakim. No charges
were filed.</TE>
<TE>   At one of the Seattle mosques, Osman became involved in
discussions about how to obtain a steady source of meat prepared
according to Muslim dietary laws, or halal meat. That's when
congregants first heard that he was moving to Bly, apparently with a
plan to raise sheep and goats to produce halal meat, Abdul-Hakim
said..</TE>
<TE>   Some fellow worshipers visited Osman in Bly, almost 400 miles
southeast of Seattle. Among them were the two brothers from the
mosque--for "target practice," according to James. According to the
FBI document, Osman "helped coordinate" the "jihad training."</TE>
<TE>   Osman is believed to have lived at a 160-acre ranch near Bly with
his wife, Angelica, a U.S.-born convert to Muslim, and her daughter,
now 11, for several months beginning in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they saw and heard little evidence--such as
automatic gunfire or large groups of strangers coming and going--that
would have signaled a training camp. Nor were many African Americans
or foreigners seen in a place where they would stand out.</TE>
<TE>   A knowledgeable source reported that after the Sept. 11 attacks,
the FBI reviewed a December 1999 traffic stop of Osman. Two of his
passengers may have been top aides to Hamza al-Masri, the
controversial London sheik, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   After his livestock operation foundered, Osman and his family
moved out. They eventually settled in Tacoma, Wash., and Osman
enrolled in a computer course at a nearby university, continued his
Navy Reserve drills and again worked as a car mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   But he hurt his back in an accident and was unable to put in many
hours, said the station owner, Mohammad Siddiqui, an Indian Muslim
who, like other co-workers, found Osman more enthusiastic about
religion and politics than fixing cars.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Osman] talked a little bit too much," Siddiqui said as he
rang up gasoline sales on a recent afternoon. "These days, talk can
get you into trouble."</TE>

<HD>Noelle Bush Returns to Rehab Center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush's daughter, Noelle, was allowed to return to a drug
rehabilitation center Friday, two days after being jailed for
allegedly taking prescription pills from a nurse's cabinet.</LD>
<LD>   "I would not allow you to go back to the facility if I didn't
think you could do the program," Circuit Judge Reginald Whitehead
said in giving President Bush's niece a second chance.</LD>
<LD>   "You're very intelligent; you have the support there," he said.
"You just need to work on the decisions that you're making, and I
know that you can do it."</LD>
<TE>   Bush, 24, accompanied by her brother George P. Bush and her
attorney, Pete Antonacci, said nothing in her defense during the
two-minute hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "She's definitely remorseful with what happened," her brother
said. "She recognizes her errors, that she's not perfect and that she
made a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Bush was jailed Wednesday for contempt of court for allegedly
violating her court-ordered drug treatment program. She was accused
of taking the pills from a cabinet at the rehab center.</TE>
<TE>   Antonacci said he didn't know what kind of pills they were.</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead sent Bush to jail for three days. Jail spokesman Allen
Moore said any part of a day was counted as an entire day.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was arrested in January at a pharmacy drive-through window
after allegedly trying to buy the anti-anxiety drug Xanax with a
fraudulent prescription. She was admitted to the treatment center a
month later, with the possibility that charges would be dropped if
she completed the program.</TE>
<TE>   The governor was allowed to briefly visit his daughter in jail
Wednesday, even though visits are usually limited to weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "She realized there are consequences to her actions and that she
has to pay a price," he said. "I respect the judge's decision."</TE>

<HD>Illnesses Prompt Federal Recall of ConAgra Beef</HD>
<DH>Food: Sixteen confirmed cases of E. coli infection are
linked to a plant in Colorado. The 19 million pounds of meat was
shipped to 21 states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Agriculture officials announced a massive recall of nearly 19 million
pounds of beef on Friday, saying the meat was linked to 22 confirmed
or suspected E. coli infections in six states, including at least one
case in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   The voluntary recall, the second largest ever of ground beef,
targets meat processed at ConAgra Beef Co.'s Greeley, Colo., plant
between April 12 and July 11. The meat was shipped to stores in at
least 21 states, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   It marks the second time in less than a month that ConAgra--one of
the nation's largest food distributors--has had to recall beef
because of E. coli concerns. A recall of 354,200 pounds on June 30
was due to contamination confirmed by plant inspectors on June 19 and
not, at the time, linked to illnesses.</LD>
<TE>   The delays between the initial discovery of E. coli contamination
and the two recalls led to sharp criticism of Agriculture Department
procedures and prompted changes just last week.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said the latest recall "is
being taken as a precautionary measure to ensure the protection of
public health. We are recommending that consumers and businesses who
have purchased products on these specific dates should either return
product to point of purchase or discard it."</TE>
<TE>   Veneman and other federal officials conceded that individual
consumers might have a hard time determining whether ground beef in
their refrigerators and freezers was among the recalled lots because
beef is often repackaged at retail outlets.</TE>
<TE>   California state health officials confirmed Friday that a
32-year-old Los Angeles woman was sickened after eating contaminated
ConAgra meat. The woman, said health department spokeswoman Lea
Brooks, fell ill June 19 and has since recovered. She did not require
hospitalization, Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   The exact source of the woman's infection has been difficult to
trace, officials said, since she ate hamburger meat cooked rare on
several occasions before getting sick.</TE>
<TE>   And Los Angeles County health officials said they were
investigating another case possibly linked to the ConAgra meat.</TE>
<TE>   State and local officials said they were still trying to find out
how much potentially contaminated product was shipped to California.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely want that information," Brooks said. "We are trying
to determine if the product is still on the shelf [in stores and
homes]. We don't know for certain where it has gone."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the recalled beef was repackaged at Kroger Co. grocery
stores, which include Ralphs and Food4Less outlets in Southern
California. A Kroger spokesman said Friday afternoon that company
officials were still working with ConAgra to determine which
locations nationwide had received the potentially tainted beef.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lesson here," said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, Los Angeles
County's public health director. "Cook your hamburger well-done,
refrigerate or freeze your meat soon after buying it and always wash
your hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water both before and after
handling raw food."</TE>
<TE>   USDA officials on Friday made available on their Web site
(www.usda.gov) an extensive list of lot numbers and also advised
consumers with questions about the recall to call (866) 849-7438.</TE>
<TE>   E. coli is a potentially deadly bacterium that often causes severe
stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea. It can be spread to meat during
the butchering process from cattle feces or be transmitted through
contaminated water. Meat containing E. coli does not look or smell
bad, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Most at risk from E. coli bacteria are children, the elderly and
anyone whose immune system is suppressed. About 73,000 people fall
ill from E. coli each year and 60 die, according to CDC statistics.</TE>
<TE>   ConAgra officials agreed to expand the recall Friday after
officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
determined that the E. coli strain found at the plant was directly
linked to 16 confirmed cases of illness in Colorado and six suspected
cases in California, Michigan, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming.
Of the CDC-confirmed cases, five patients, including four children,
required hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators at the Atlanta-based CDC began tracking the strain
of E. coli discovered at the ConAgra plant after being informed July
8 by Colorado state health officials of a cluster of infections
there.</TE>
<TE>   Although Agriculture officials confirmed the presence of E. coli
contamination at the ConAgra plant on June 19--following completion
of tests on a sample taken five days earlier--the company was not
informed of the finding until 10 days later.</TE>
<TE>   On July 15, Linda Swacina, acting administrator for the Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said it was "deeply troubling" that
Colorado residents had gotten sick from consuming contaminated meat
despite the "rigorous system of meat and poultry inspection."</TE>
<TE>   In response, Swacina said, her division "sent an investigation
team to the ConAgra plant in Colorado and has implemented a new
policy to more quickly trace back tainted meat."</TE>
<TE>   Veneman said Friday the Agriculture Department was continuing to
investigate what had gone wrong at ConAgra's meat processing plant.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to determine what happened and to ensure the public
health and safety," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "And we will continue to act swiftly and responsibly to ensure a
safe and wholesome food supply for consumers."</TE>

<HD>Deal on Corporate Reform Nears</HD>
<DH>Congress: The tougher Senate measure is used as a baseline.
Bush may get final bill next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With their differences narrowed to a few core issues, House and
Senate negotiators said Friday that they hope to send President Bush
a bill next week that would increase oversight of accountants and
stiffen penalties for corporate crime.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual speed with which the lawmakers are moving on the
complex bill is a strong sign of the powerful political force behind
the legislation--a momentum given new urgency by the falling stock
market.</LD>
<LD>   Members of both parties are eager to act on business reforms
before returning home for their summer recess and facing voters
asking what they have done about the corporate accounting abuses that
have cost investors billions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   "It's time for us to come together, recognize our common ground
and finish crafting a good piece of legislation to get to the
president's desk by the end of next week," said Rep. Michael G. Oxley
(R-Ohio), who is presiding over the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   In their first meeting Friday, negotiators agreed to use the
Senate bill as the underlying text for their talks, a sign that House
Republicans may be willing to accept much of the tougher Senate
measure. The staffs planned more talks over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Mann, an expert on Congress at the nonpartisan Brookings
Institution, said the decision to use the Senate bill, drafted by
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), "reflects the fact that Republicans
are near panic on the market collapse and its connection to the
corporate scandals, and are prepared to quickly accept virtually the
entire Sarbanes bill, with a few get-tougher measures added on."</TE>
<TE>   The major sticking points are proposals to create an accounting
oversight board and extend the time frame from three years to five
for plaintiffs to bring securities fraud lawsuits against companies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in his radio address today, is expected to again urge
Congress to resolve its differences and send him a bill to sign
before lawmakers go home for a monthlong recess.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans particularly fear that if they don't get something
done quickly the voters will be bearish about them as well as the
market," said Marshall Wittmann, a political scholar at the
conservative Hudson Institute.</TE>
<TE>   A key House Republican negotiator, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin of
Louisiana, said that if negotiations drag on past midweek, he was
prepared to urge the House to jettison its own bill and simply pass
the Senate version.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration is very clear that they would rather have us
pass a bill that is not necessarily the best bill than to not act,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are attempting to work out their differences over how
powerful a new accounting oversight board should be.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate bill, the board would operate independently of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. It would have the power to
set auditing and ethics rules and discipline auditors. The
five-member board would be appointed by the SEC, with two
members--but no more--having accounting backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill delegates much of the details of the new board's
authority to the SEC. House Republicans also favor a panel with four
of the five members having an accounting background. The Bush
administration has expressed concern that the board created by the
Senate bill could compete with the SEC, making it more difficult to
enforce auditing standards.</TE>
<TE>   On another contentious issue, business groups have expressed
concern that extending the statute of limitations for securities
fraud could lead to frivolous lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said the current statute of
limitations has prevented fraud victims from suing Enron Corp. for
misdeeds dating to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   House Republicans are pushing to make sure the bill includes a
requirement for companies to more rapidly disclose information
affecting their financial health and the establishment of a system
for returning ill-gotten gains to investors who have lost money as a
result of corporate malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   One issue that may not be as contentious as originally thought is
a provision of the Senate bill that goes further in limiting the
amount of consulting that accounting firms can do for companies they
audit. "I would doubt it would be a huge issue in the conference,"
Oxley said.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt urged Congress on Friday to pass
legislation quickly. He also defended his record in cracking down on
corporate wrongdoing and again rejected calls for his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have charged that the SEC chairman's past work as a lawyer
for the accounting industry makes him unsuitable for the job. But
Pitt, in a speech at the National Press Club, termed his background a
plus.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe that they need somebody who knows where the
bodies are buried, knows how business is done, has credibility both
in the business community and in the legal community, and is not
afraid to take decisive action," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I really refuse to believe that the American public would be
happier with somebody who knew absolutely nothing about the
securities markets or how to fix them."</TE>

<HD>Spy Museum Lets You In on the Secret</HD>
<DH>History: Washington site, headed by an ex-CIA officer,
houses gadgets and all things espionage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Secrecy is its business, but the International Spy Museum opened very
publicly Friday with news crews swarming the first day of the
nation's only museum devoted to divulging the tricks of the Stasi,
the KGB and the CIA.</LD>
<LD>   A placard in the museum quotes Winston Churchill: "In wartime,
truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a
bodyguard of lies." And spies, apparently, should be attended by a
few cool gizmos to get the job done.</LD>
<LD>   The museum's trove of intelligence equipment--about 1,000
artifacts--would make any gadget maven marvel: cipher machines,
counterfeit currencies, an umbrella that shoots poison pellets, the
"Kiss of Death" lipstick pistol.</LD>
<TE>   One room showcases super-cameras. A German model with a lens as
wide as an elephant's trunk can photograph through a wall. A Zodchi
sub-mini camera from the 1980s is the size of a 9-volt battery. The
Echo 8 lens is concealed in a cigarette lighter. The Tessina's lens
is tucked inside a brown snakeskin cigarette case.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibits spotlight "spooks" both real and make-believe: a replica
of James Bonds' silver Astin Martin from the movie "Goldfinger" is on
prominent display.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the paraphernalia may be vestiges of an earlier era. But
the interactive exhibits that test a visitor's reflexes and
observation skills--prized assets of any spy--are distinctly modern.</TE>
<TE>   The museum, not far from FBI headquarters, is housed in a series
of five buildings built in the late 19th century. Inside, its walls
are steel gray and its decor decidedly spare and modernist.</TE>
<TE>   A circus-like atmosphere prevailed Friday: The "Mission
Impossible" theme played as acrobats in trench coats twirled across
the face of the building. Washington Mayor Anthony A. Williams played
dress-up in a black fedora and fake mustache. And actress Barbara
Feldon, "Agent 99" from the 1960s television series "Get Smart," put
in an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Maltz, a code breaker for the National Security Agency
during the Korean War, donated $15 million toward the $40-million
project. Private donations and city loans provided the balance in the
for-profit venture.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not good at playing golf or walking the dog on the beach,"
Maltz said, explaining his interest in spy culture. Museums
"shouldn't be musty, dusty places. They should be educational, and
have a sense of compelling interest."</TE>
<TE>   As onlookers eager to pay the $11 admission avoided the sun with
purses, museum leaflets and wet towels, Maltz read the biographies of
the 16-member museum board and council. Among those serving: William
H. Webster, the only person to serve as director of both the FBI and
the CIA, and Oleg Kalugin, the KGB's former chief of foreign
counterintelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's executive director, E. Peter Earnest, shared his
vision for the museum. "The ranks of spies include some of the
biggest rogues in history," he said. "When you visit, you yourself
must judge whether it was for the greater good of history or not."</TE>
<TE>   Earnest worked for 36 years at the CIA, including 20 years in
clandestine services. Holding fast to a spy's code of conduct, he
refused to reveal which Middle East and European countries he had
worked in.</TE>
<TE>   In the museum, it's the "outed" kings and queens of espionage who
get star billing.</TE>
<TE>   Captioned photographs and a video display detail their lives. The
"Madonna of Espionage," code name "Sonia," gave Russia information on
the atomic bomb. A British Embassy employee in Washington during WWII
earned the title "most valuable agent" for the amount of war
information he funneled to Soviet agents.</TE>
<TE>   One display features turncoat FBI agent Robert Philip Hanssen, who
pleaded guilty in February 2001 to spying for the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   When he was captured, according to the exhibit, Hanssen quipped to
the agents: " 'Ha! What took you so long?' "</TE>

<HD>More Breast-Feeding, Lesser Risk of Cancer</HD>
<DH>Study: Data from women in 30 countries show that extending
the practice by six months could eliminate 250,000 cases a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer if they extend the
duration of breast-feeding, according to a study to be published
today using data from 30 countries.</LD>
<LD>   It is well known that childbearing can reduce a woman's risk for
breast cancer, but this large analysis, combining research from 47
epidemiological studies from around the globe, is the first to
dissect out the specific protective effect of breast-feeding over a
woman's lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   The research, to be published today in the Lancet journal,
predicts that if women in developed countries would extend the time
they breast-feed by six months, approximately 250,000 cases of breast
cancer, or 5% of the total, could be prevented each year.</LD>
<TE>   The differences in patterns of breast-feeding around the world are
enough to account for why breast cancer is so rare in developing
countries and so common in the United States and other developed
countries, said Valerie Beral, an Oxford University epidemiologist
and one of the central organizers of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Wendy Slusser, director of the breast-feeding research program
at UCLA's school of public health and medicine, said the study is
unique--the large numbers allowed researchers to take into account
any of the confounding variables that may also affect breast cancer,
and therefore tease out the contribution of breast-feeding.</TE>
<TE>   Previous research showed a benefit only for pre-menopausal women,
whereas this study shows that breast-feeding can protect a woman
throughout her lifetime, Slusser said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a minimal technological intervention to reduce risk,"
Slusser said. It can be hard to change the number of children or the
timing of childbearing, but it is simple to increase the duration of
breast-feeding, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has one of the lowest breast-feeding rates of the
countries that contributed to the study, with 50% of women
breast-feeding, compared to a rate of 90% in Japan and the
Scandinavian countries.</TE>
<TE>   Slusser said that, in California, 80% of women breast-feed at the
time of their children's births. But after 6 months, only 40%
continue the practice. They may stop because of lack of support in
the workplace or from their families, Slusser said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. John Glaspy, medical director of the Oncology Clinic at UCLA's
Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, supports the general findings of
the study. But because the research combined data from so many
different sources, he said the exact decrease in risk must be
interpreted with caution.</TE>
<TE>   The study looked at data from 50,302 women with cancer and 96,973
control subjects who were cancer free, from 30 countries around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers compared data on women from developing countries who
had a breast-feeding duration of three months and an average of two
or three children, to women in developing countries such as rural
Asia and Africa, where women breast-feed over two years and have an
average of six children.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers calculated a decline in risk of 4.3% for every year of
breast-feeding. That was consistent across many variables that
contribute to breast cancer risk; the number of children a woman has,
her weight, and age of menopause.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying women should run out and have six children,
Oxford's Beral said. "We need to understand how this works so we can
try to mimic the effect."</TE>
<TE>   Glaspy hypothesizes that breast-feeding reduces risk of breast
cancer because it reduces the number of menstrual cycles a woman has
over her lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Many other factors that affect breast cancer risk also are linked
to a woman's total number of menstrual cycles--age of menarche, age
of menopause, and number of children, Glaspy said. The factors
decrease the lifelong exposure of a woman's breast to estrogen
surges, which occur during the first weeks of the menstrual cycle.
When a woman is breast-feeding, she is less likely to ovulate and the
surges of estrogen are less frequent.</TE>
<TE>   Glaspy said the challenge is to fit these findings into the
lifestyles of modern women. "We need to provide women with the
advantages of lots of pregnancies and early menopause," he said,
"without having lots of children."</TE>
