<HD>British DJs Are Going out for Solo Spins</HD>
<DH>Electronica* The first original material is due shortly
from Paul Oakenfold and Sasha.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>British DJs Paul Oakenfold and Sasha have been as responsible as
anyone behind the decks for the DJ revolution that has overtaken the
U.S. Both have helped popularize and publicize a movement that can
now draw tens of thousands of fans on any given weekend. At the
Coachella Festival three weeks ago, Oakenfold and Sasha (with his DJ
partner John Digweed) drew legions of rabid dance fans to their sets,
even though they went head to head with rock/pop stars the Strokes
and Bjork, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   With the memory of those stellar performances still fresh, each
artist is preparing to release his first album of original material.</LD>
<LD>   Oakenfold's "Bunkka," due in stores June 25 from Maverick Records,
hits first, and it features a diverse roster of guest vocalists,
including Nelly Furtado, and Tricky, Ice Cube, Perry Farrell and even
gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. But Oakenfold's large,
keyboard-heavy trance hooks remain the driving force of his music.</LD>
<TE>   "To me, it's a modern dance record," Oakenfold says. "It features
all aspects of contemporary dance, but I wanted the record to be
song-based because I grew up on songs."</TE>
<TE>   Sasha (who plays the Mayan Theatre on Wednesday with Digweed) will
release his long-awaited "Air Drawn Dagger" Aug. 6 on Kinetic
Records. Recorded in Amsterdam over an eight-month period, the
12-track instrumental collection finds the DJ following a new and
largely solo path.</TE>
<TE>   Although these are their first collections of new material, both
Sasha and Oakenfold have gathered huge international fan bases
through their mix collections, remix work and live DJ performances,
and expectations will be high for both works.</TE>
<TE>   "I never set out to make a club record," cautions Oakenfold. "I
hope people judge the record on its own and not pre-expect anything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALBUMS ADD: Although the Sasha and Oakenfold releases top the list
of anticipated electronic records in the coming months, they are not
alone. Also certain to attract a lot of interest are DJ Shadow's "The
Private Press" (out June 4), his first album since 1998's "Preemptive
Strike"; a new Underworld collection (due in September); the third
album of original material from influential British DJ Carl Cox (set
for a late summer release); and the soundtrack to the film "Stark
Raving Mad," which finds another great British DJ, John Digweed,
making his first foray into film composing.</TE>
<TE>   The indie side of the electronic music scene is also well
represented this summer. Two albums that stand out are "MG4R," the
latest effort from Mondo Grosso, the brainchild of Japanese
producer-composer Shinici Osawa, and the Cinematic Orchestra's
gorgeous "Everyday." Both records are bolstered by a heavy love for
jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Osawa relies more on up-tempo, piano-based riffs, a bit of scat
singing and some groovy acid jazz. The centerpiece of "MG4R" (out
Tuesday) is the swinging "Samba Do Gato," a 10-minute-plus party that
joyfully combines acid jazz, Brazilian beats and some nifty scat
singing. "Every Day" (May 28) is also highlighted by an epic--the
nearly seven-minute opener, "All That You Give." The tune, which
features '60s soul singer Fontella Bass, sets the tone for the rest
of the collection. If the rest of the CD doesn't always live up to
that high standard, the album's sweeping, ambient soundscapes provide
plenty of incentive to check out "Every Day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON THE LIVE TIP: L.A. will again see a healthy number of summer
dance-music events, but the most memorable figures to be Moby's Area2
tour. While Moby has had an occasionally tempestuous relationship
with the electronic community he came from, he is doing his part for
the scene.</TE>
<TE>   When his 12-date Area2 tour kicks off in July (the package reaches
Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine on Aug. 13), it will feature
a stellar lineup of DJs and dance acts that could benefit greatly
from the exposure to larger audiences drawn by Moby, David Bowie and
Busta Rhymes. It's likely that Carl Cox, a superb technician and
showman behind the decks, will win over a number of converts during
the tour. An international superstar, he'll be reaching his biggest
U.S. audiences in many of the cities.</TE>
<TE>   To a degree, the same could be said for the rest of the
international crew--Holland's DJ Tiesto, L.A.'s DJ Dan, Digweed and
Australian band the Avalanches.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously touring with somebody like Moby is huge," Digweed says.
"You're introducing fans to what you do, which is good for
everybody."</TE>

<HD>The Man of a Thousand Hats</HD>
<DH>Jefferson Mays has transformed himself into a
cross-dressing Berliner and a French priest. His new challenge: a
classic con man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>If Des McAnuff has learned one thing about Jefferson Mays in the 13
years since they began working together, it's that this little-known
but highly regarded stage actor is often at play when he's at work.</LD>
<LD>   "With Jefferson, the entire rehearsal process is hysterical," says
McAnuff, La Jolla Playhouse artistic director, who is staging
Moliere's "Tartuffe" with Mays in the title role. "He is as capable
of being funny as anyone I know, and he knows that when you're doing
a comedy it's important to laugh."</LD>
<LD>   So it was that Mays stalked across an orange-carpeted studio
recently, clawing the air and letting out a Jurassic shriek after
rehearsing a wild seduction scene. He announced that he would try
playing his character, a seemingly pious con man who is one of
literature's great scoundrels, "just a little more reptilian."</LD>
<TE>   "You do reptilian well," McAnuff said with a nod. They tried
again, and Mays was all slithery, bodice-ripping, feet-off-the-floor
sexual ardor--each grope and thrust plunging him further into the
trap that Tartuffe's lust object, Elmire, has set to reveal him for
what he is. The scene required Mays to deliver demanding rhymed
couplets while engaged in acrobatic exertions--and to shift in a
matter of moments from libidinous frenzy to
caught-with-his-trousers-down bedroom farce to the venomous rage of a
cornered viper.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, being reptilian would seem well within his
compass--especially since he already has won over La Jolla audiences
by proving himself a remarkable chameleon.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, during a three-week public workshop production at the
playhouse, Mays starred in a one-man tour de force called "I Am My
Own Wife." Outfitted in a black housedress and pearl necklace, he
played all 27 roles in Doug Wright's stage adaptation of the life of
Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, a Berliner who outlasted the Nazis and the
East German Communists without compromising his determination to live
openly as a cross-dressing gay man. Born Lothar Berfelde in 1928, Von
Mahlsdorf turned his home into a museum of elegant 19th century
furnishings and "decadent" pre-Nazi cabaret culture. With Moises
Kaufman ("The Laramie Project") directing, Mays will perform "I Am My
Own Wife" in its premiere next spring at Playwrights Horizons in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether the play is a work of genius or absolute dreck, there's
one thing I know in my soul, and that's that Jefferson is absolutely
astonishing in it," says Wright, best known for "Quills," a macabre,
Obie-winning fantasia on the last days of the Marquis de Sade. "It's
going to show the breadth and magnitude of his talent. If people
don't know Jefferson Mays, I'm hoping that after ['Wife'] he receives
appropriate acclaim."</TE>
<TE>   Since his undergraduate days at Yale, Mays, now 36, has focused
his existence on the stage. While earning a double-major degree in
classics and art history, this hyper-articulate, Connecticut-raised
son of a naval officer and a children's librarian found that what he
really loved was acting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty much always doing theater," Mays said during a break
in rehearsals. "It's like being in school for life. You're always
immersing yourself utterly in a subject, a period. And you're thrown
together with a bunch of charismatic, intelligent people. It's really
a wonderful life."</TE>
<TE>   Even off the stage, Mays cuts an actorly figure, enunciating
precisely and sprinkling his friendly conversation with many a
rhetorical flourish. Most folks don't use phrases like "It chills the
blood." He wears a black beret--and keeps it on during rehearsals.
Hats of all sorts have been his trademark since he was 5, he says,
and he seldom goes about bareheaded.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, who has known him since they were at Yale together,
describes Mays as "an absolutely theatrical creature [who] truly has
greasepaint flowing through his veins."</TE>
<TE>   An odd happenstance brought Mays into the orbit of McAnuff and La
Jolla Playhouse in 1988. College was over and he was on the verge of
moving to New York City to try his luck on stage. He had never been
to California, and graduate school was not in his plans. But 3,000
miles away, one of the eight to 10 aspiring actors accepted each year
by UC San Diego's graduate theater program decided he wanted to
attend the Yale School of Drama instead. Walt Jones, head of the
acting program at UCSD, needed a player--fast. He conferred with
students already at the school, and a couple of ex-Yalies, director
Maria Mileaf and scenic designer Neil Patel, told him great things
about Mays. From the sound of it, Jones said, this was the kind of
actor--versed in Shakespeare but no stranger to experimental
work--who could be a valuable swing man in the wide range of plays
the UCSD grad school puts on.</TE>
<TE>   He flew to New York and auditioned Mays in a tiny hotel room. The
professor, still in his pajama top after taking the red-eye the night
before, cleared away furniture and sat in the closet so Mays would
have room to do a turn as Iago. "There was no doubt in my mind,"
Jones recalled. "I told him, 'You want the position, you're in. I'll
get you help with finances, anything it takes.'"</TE>
<TE>   Each graduate acting student at UCSD is guaranteed at least one
paid role at the affiliated La Jolla Playhouse, which is on the
university campus. Jones, who now is chairman of the department of
theater and dance, says that getting to play two parts in three years
is a mark of distinction. Mays played three--the porter in "Macbeth,"
Fabian in "Twelfth Night" (both directed by McAnuff) and a part in
Keith Reddin's "Life During Wartime." Mays' first role after
graduating in 1991 was in a La Jolla Playhouse production of Lee
Blessing's "Fortinbras." A Times reviewer hailed him as "the play's
delicious second banana."</TE>
<TE>   By 1992, Mays was living in New York City with his drama school
sweetheart (their marriage lasted five years). In 1993, he won an
Obie for his work in the title role of "Orestes," Charles L. Mee's
modern adaptation of Euripides' drama. Mays wound up in a hospital
emergency room for shots and stitches after his first performance:
The production was staged on a crumbling, old, debris-strewn
abandoned pier on the Hudson River, and somewhere near the end he
noticed he had sliced his elbow open on a stray bit of metal or
glass.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, he originated the role of the Abbe de Coulmier, the
compassionate priest in "Quills" who tries to redeem the Marquis de
Sade from an obsession with writing pornography. The priest's attempt
to cure the indomitable De Sade lands him in a hell of his own inner
corruption. There was no place for Mays in the 2000 film version of
"Quills"--even though his two enthusiastic fans, Wright and McAnuff,
served as screenwriter and executive producer. In big-budget movies,
names attract financing and help sell tickets; Mays says he
understands the nature of things and had no problem with his friends
drafting Joaquin Phoenix to play the part he had created on stage.
McAnuff did cast Mays in a supporting role opposite Jessica Lange and
Elisabeth Shue in "Cousin Bette." The 1998 film, based on a novel by
Balzac, was McAnuff's debut as a feature film director. That and some
small independent pictures have been it for Mays as a film actor. He
said he recently received an offer to appear in an episode of "The
West Wing" but had to turn down what would have been his network TV
debut because shooting conflicted with "Tartuffe."</TE>
<TE>   "Inevitably, somebody will stumble across him and gobble him up"
for screen roles, McAnuff says. "In the meantime, we've got him as
Tartuffe."</TE>
<TE>   For Mays, who has played many classic characters, including a
well-received Hamlet at San Diego Repertory in 1995, this is his
first encounter with Moliere--and with dialogue in rhymed verse.
"Trying to make it sound like living thought, spontaneous speech, is
the big challenge," he says. "And yet, also honoring the verse and
not fighting against it too much." If done right, he says, it should
be "sort of like riding a wave, where you get carried along by the
flood of language."</TE>
<TE>   Mays relishes playing a classic villain--but he is aiming for
something more. "He is certainly diabolical, the seven deadly sins in
action. But I'm trying to find some sort of humanity in him at
points, little flashes of human frailty or vulnerability. I don't
want audiences to get a bead on him."</TE>
<TE>   Mays has another new challenge: waiting, night after night, to be
Tartuffe. The title character doesn't appear until nearly midway
through the play; his arrival is given a big anticipatory buildup by
his enemies and his dupes.</TE>
<TE>   Mays confessed that nothing has prepared him for the acting
challenge of doing nothing, and he hadn't yet figured out how to cope
with it. "Generally, I pace tiger-like in the wings" while waiting to
go on, he says. But 40 minutes of that won't do--too draining. "I
could be going quietly mad in my dressing room. It could be terribly,
terribly lonely."</TE>
<TE>   The wait will be worth it, promises director McAnuff, who has some
highly unorthodox surprises up his sleeve for Tartuffe--and the
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have quite an entrance, as you can imagine."</TE>

<HD>Reborn on Stage</HD>
<DH>After years of avoiding the theater, Judith Light recharged
with roles that force her to look deep within</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judith Light has just returned from a 100-mile wilderness trek in
South Africa. If the hike didn't get her, you'd think the airplane
food would. But the actress, whose flight landed only a day ago, is
admitting no wear and tear.</LD>
<LD>   "When you're doing things that give you energy, you're not tired,"
says Light, chatting during the lunch break of her first day of
rehearsals for Athol Fugard's "Sorrows and Rejoicings." The play
opens at the Mark Taper Forum on Thursday, in a production directed
by the playwright. "This is all very exciting to me. It feels very
alive. It doesn't exhaust me, it feeds me."</LD>
<LD>   Really? "Well," she admits, "at some point today, I'm going to
probably feel it."</LD>
<TE>   And no one would blame her. Light wasn't in South Africa to do
character research for her role in the South African playwright's
latest work. On the contrary, she participated in the trek as part of
her ongoing commitment to AIDS causes. The fact that her destination
just happened to be where the play was set was purely serendipity.
The trip had been scheduled long before Light was cast.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be some sort of pure cosmic timing, because we had
planned to do this a year ago," says Light, whose extreme thinness
accentuates her big brown eyes and square jaw. She is affable and
exudes kindness, speaking softly yet insistently, as though it's
crucial to her that what she has to say gets across. "I went to New
York, did the play. Then I came back, had a week before I left for
South Africa, and literally came back yesterday afternoon, and
rehearsals are starting today."</TE>
<TE>   Timing notwithstanding, the trek was the kind of challenge she
welcomes. "When you put yourself up against a demand like that, it
has the potential to turn you into a different person, because you
look at your life very differently," says Light, who was joined on
the hike by her husband of 17 years, actor Robert Desiderio.
"Celebrity can be hollow unless you're doing something with it."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the trip gave her the added bonus of insight into the
Fugard play. "There were images that I talk about in the play that I
would see there, and I could only have done that with my imagination
before when I was in the New York production," says Light, referring
to her previous stint in the same play. "I knew that I would come
back and it would be different. It does feel like I'm beginning all
over again.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that when I was in Athol's land, I could understand things
about him in a way that I hadn't been able to see before," Light
adds. "It's as though there's a constant heartbeat, and that land has
an energy that you can see and feel. I'd never seen such abject
poverty and squalor, and yet this immeasurable gratitude in these
people for whatever they have, this loving open-heartedness, this
warm embrace."</TE>
<TE>   Set in Fugard's homeland of the Karoo, a semi-arid region in South
Africa, "Sorrows and Rejoicings" takes place immediately following
the funeral of a white poet exiled for his dissident views. The man's
estranged white wife and his black mistress--who is also a family
servant and the mother of his only child--return to the house where
he grew up and confront one another.</TE>
<TE>   Told partly in flashback, with the poet appearing at various ages
and the daughter hovering on the periphery, the story unfolds as a
chronicle of the emotional fallout of apartheid. In addition to
Light, the Taper cast features John Glover, Cynthia Martells and
Brienin Nequa Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The play premiered at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, N.J., in
2001 and was produced later that year at the Baxter Theatre Centre at
the University of Cape Town in South Africa. It opened at
off-Broadway's Second Stage in New York in February, with both Light
and Glover in the cast, as well as Charlayne Woodard.</TE>
<TE>   Fugard has directed all of the productions so far. The Taper
production will be his final outing as a director: He says he wants
to concentrate on his writing. Fugard has used several different
actresses for Allison Olivier, wife of exiled poet Dawid. He cast
Light not on the basis of an audition, but thanks to a long lunch
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember us talking specifically about the play or the
character," Light says. "I remember us talking about the essence of
life and spirit and relationships and psychology, which is what this
play is about. It had to do with people's connections, the barriers
that they put up, and what is required to overcome those barriers. I
don't want to sound like this woo-woo Southern Californian, but it
was a very cosmic conversation to me, as though two old souls had met
and were continuing a conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Cosmic or not, Fugard clearly heard something that told him Light
was the one. "The huge challenge in casting Allison is that you've
got to have an actress who's prepared to be really naked
emotionally," says the noted writer-director, who had never seen
Light on stage before casting her. "The thing with Allison is that
she comes from a culture, a middle-class white world, a world in
which you're involved in hiding your emotions. It's not done to have
them hanging out all the time. But when push comes to shove, the
actress has got to be able to hang it all out. Judith does that
magnificently."</TE>
<TE>   "This is very much a woman who has been in control all of her life
and has closed herself down," Light says of her character, Allison.
"And in the process of this play, she knows that there are truths
that she has to tell and amends that have to be made between she and
Marta, and forgiveness that she has to begin to understand in
herself. She begins to understand what her culpability was, and that
it's only through telling the truth to this woman in this moment in
time that she will ever be free."</TE>
<TE>   The strategy that Light takes is not necessarily the easiest. "She
makes no attempt to get the audience to like her, and I've previously
worked with actors who approached the role very differently," Fugard
says. "She is fearless in the way she goes out in the first few
seconds of the play, saying, if anything, maybe you'd be well advised
not to like me.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing Judith Light has proven herself to have is
courage," Fugard continues. "And you're also looking for a superbly
crafted actor. That emotion has to be modulated. So it's craft,
courage--and I wish I could find a third c. The other word that one
is looking for is intelligence and the ability to read a text
carefully."</TE>
<TE>   Still, that intelligence has to be combined with intuition and
flexibility. "Performance is something that must be born anew every
night, and Judith has a very special gift in that respect," says
Fugard. "I know from my own experience as an actor how important it
is to tune into the chemistry of the audience. You've got to feel
your audience within the first few minutes and modulate your
performance accordingly, and Judith is very skillful at that."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Light has been honing those skills a long time. While she
is perhaps best known for her TV work, she started out as a stage
actress.</TE>
<TE>   Born and reared in Trenton, N.J., Light, now 52, was an only child
who developed an interest in performing early on--about age 3, by her
account. She spent her childhood attending performing arts camps,
then enrolled in the theater program at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating, Light paid her dues for five years in regional
theater, mostly in Milwaukee and Seattle, before landing her first
roles in New York, including her Broadway debut in Ibsen's "A Doll's
House" in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Light was signed as a regular on the ABC soap
"One Life to Live." While on "One Life to Live," she won two Daytime
Emmy awards and other awards for her portrayal of Karen Wolek.  In
1984, she landed the sitcom "Who's the Boss?" with Tony Danza, a
series that lasted eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Light did many TV movies during the '80s and '90s, including "The
Ryan White Story," which inspired her AIDS activism. She began
spending time on the speaking circuit, "talking to many different
groups about how courageous and inspiring the gay community has been
to me."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, her agent suggested a return to the stage. "I made up
some mishegoss that it wasn't really the thing I should be doing,"
Light recalls. "After I said no, my manager said, 'I just want you to
know that I think you're scared.'"</TE>
<TE>   He was right. She hadn't done a play in 22 years. But Light
decided to go for the next one that came along, which turned out to
be Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama "Wit," about Dr.
Vivian Bearing, a scholar who is dying of ovarian cancer. "I read the
play, and I was incredibly moved," Light recalls. "They said, you
know you're going to have to shave your head.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I'm reading the play, and it says, 'She takes off her own
hospital gown, and she takes off the other hospital gown, and then at
the end, she is naked and beautiful in the light.' And I said, 'She
is what and beautiful in the light?' And I said, 'Oh no, I should
have gone up for that other play. Then I wouldn't have to do this.'
But in fact, it's the best thing that ever happened."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly it turned her career around--or rather, brought her back
to the vocation that had lain dormant through all those TV years.
Light replaced Kathleen Chalfant in "Wit" in New York, spent six
months in the role and got strong notices.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the New York Times in 1999, Peter Marks said, "The
folly uncovered here is that Ms. Light has avoided the stage for far
too long. Her performance  ... cuts poignantly close to the bone. It
is the sort of transformational work that would hint at other future
successes, with Shakespeare, maybe, if a full-time career in the
theater were truly an option these days."</TE>
<TE>   Light went on tour with "Wit" for a year, in Florida, Boston,
Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. Among the many who saw her
perform was Michael Kahn, artistic director of the Shakespeare
Theatre in Washington. "I had never seen 'Who's the Boss?' which is
probably a good thing," says Kahn, speaking by phone from Washington.
"She totally bowled me over."</TE>
<TE>   His immediate thought was to bring Light to his own theater. "I
went back to the office and thought about 'Hedda Gabler,' a play I
thought I would never do again," Kahn says, referring to the Ibsen
classic whose complicated protagonist has long challenged actresses
and directors. "Here was a woman who was smart, strong and had lots
of colors."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Light assayed 'Hedda' in Washington. "We had a
wonderful working relationship," recalls Kahn, who hopes to bring
Light back to his theater next season, although they've not yet
chosen a play. "It was a case of working with a really responsive
actor who had not so much intellectual ideas, but the ability to live
through the moment."</TE>
<TE>   For the actress, it was a matter of deciphering Hedda's
complexities. "Hedda, for me, was not monstrous or evil," she says.
"For me, she was a woman caught in the web of her own narcissism, her
own inability to have found a way to stop operating as a child. She
never got beyond that neurosis and was ashamed of being in so much
emotional pain. I also see her as extremely courageous, incredibly
intelligent, and with an incredible life force."</TE>
<TE>   For Light, however, expressing things is not a problem. It's her
life's work, and nowhere more so than in her rebirth as a stage
actress. "There are a lot of things that I'm seeing and that have
troubled me for a long time in my own life--fears that have held me
back, things that I'm talking about in terms of Allison, being
protective, not open, not really vulnerable. Or like Hedda,
narcissistic. Or like Vivian, using only her intellect to get through
the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great advantage to get to play people like that, because I
find that I have to find those places in myself where those things
are true for me," Light adds. "And I don't have to reach so deep to
see them. It's been a very active process for me the last couple of
years, and it really got precipitated by my going back into theater."</TE>

<DH>In a flighty industry, the Merchant Ivory partnership has
endured for 40 years, and its principals see no reason to stop now</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Ismail Merchant had been pursuing the film rights to a book by the
famously prickly Nobel laureate V.S. Naipaul for three years when,
finally, the expansive, debonair producer-director tried the direct
approach.</LD>
<LD>   "I wrote to Vidia and said I would come and see him," Merchant
recalls. But word of Merchant's negotiating skill had reached
Naipaul. "He wrote back: 'Don't come, because I know of your
persuasive powers. Work it out with my agents.' Shortly afterwards,
we bought the book outright."</LD>
<LD>   "The Mystic Masseur," which opened Friday, is the 45th
collaboration between Merchant, 65, and the fastidious, white-haired
James Ivory, 73, whose film partnership has become almost a brand
name to moviegoers.</LD>
<TE>   "Merchant Ivory" is shorthand for a certain kind of film: a story
adapted from literature featuring imposing houses stuffed with
expensive bric-a-brac, women in bonnets and corsets, men in white
linen suits or tuxedos. Period dramas enacted against the ravishing
backdrops of rural England, Italy, France, India or America's eastern
seaboard.</TE>
<TE>   Class and money surface as issues, but discreetly so; these are
restrained films, without profanity, violence or fast-paced action.</TE>
<TE>   Today the partners, with screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, mark
40 years since the first Merchant Ivory film, "The Householder," went
into production. In the cutthroat film industry, four decades is an
unusually long run.</TE>
<TE>   Not every Merchant Ivory film has been successful, either with
critics or audiences. Five films from the last decade--"Jefferson in
Paris," "Surviving Picasso," "Cotton Mary," "A Soldier's Daughter
Never Cries" and "The Golden Bowl"--have not been commercial hits.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons may be partly generational and partly stylistic. For
years, the wonder of Merchant Ivory was that they managed to make
such handsome films on shoestring budgets. But tastes in the
independent sector altered sharply with the advent of films like
Steven Soderbergh's "sex, lies, and videotape" and Quentin
Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs." Suddenly it seemed possible to make
low-budget films with wide appeal outside the studio system that were
contemporary, visually urgent and visceral. To a younger generation
of filmmakers and their new audiences, the Merchant Ivory films began
to look static, cluttered and a little dull.</TE>
<TE>   But despite a recent lean patch, few would rule out the
possibility of Merchant Ivory successes in the future. The team is
now shooting its adaptation of Diane Johnson's novel "Le Divorce" in
Paris with the hip young actresses Kate Hudson ("Almost Famous") and
Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive"). At the advanced stage of Merchant
and Ivory's careers, they will certainly stay together--and they have
proved they can make both commercial and critical hits.</TE>
<TE>   Their halcyon days came between 1986 and 1993, with three costume
dramas involving British characters that came to define Merchant
Ivory's house style. "A Room With a View," "Howards End" and "The
Remains of the Day" were worldwide hits that garnered a cluster of
Oscars and Oscar nominations.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Indian-born Merchant, who directed "The Mystic Masseur,"
becomes irritated if Merchant Ivory's name is linked solely to
costume drama. "People misunderstand," he complained in an interview
at his London home earlier this year. "If you wear a costume and
you're in a stately home, yes, it's a costume drama. But people don't
say that it's also a good story. Our very first film had a good
story, delightful characters and wonderful locations. That territory
hasn't changed."</TE>
<TE>   Merchant argues that the team's recent films have diversified, and
no longer concentrate solely on the English upper classes and stately
homes.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, other filmmakers have muscled in on the costume
drama business: Martin Scorsese with "The Age Of Innocence," Ang Lee
with "Sense and Sensibility." Robert Altman has said of his
Oscar-nominated hit "Gosford Park," set in an English country house,
"We're straying into Merchant Ivory territory here."</TE>
<TE>   The partnership had inauspicious beginnings. In 1961, Merchant,
then 24, and American James Ivory, a director of short films and
documentaries, visited German-born novelist Jhabvala at her home in
New Delhi, India, with a proposal. If she wrote a screenplay based on
her novel "The Householder," the two said, they would make the
ensuing film. She was astonished; she had never even written a script
before.</TE>
<TE>   No problem, Merchant reassured her: He had never produced a
full-length feature film, and Ivory had never directed one.
Jhabvala's Indian husband, Cyrus, warned her to be wary of these two;
he suspected they might be fly-by-nights.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years on, no one in the Merchant Ivory camp has flown
anywhere. Instead, the three co-conspirators remain a creative
clique. Yet the way they approached "The Householder" created a
template for the company's subsequent productions.</TE>
<TE>   The budget was desperately tight, cast and crew working for next
to nothing, and the money ran out halfway through the shoot.
Merchant, an accomplished cook (and later an author of cookbooks),
ordered in massive quantities of food from a New Delhi restaurant and
personally served it at one big table. "You don't want to do someone
in by not paying them properly," he says, "but you can create a
certain atmosphere to make them part of your life. Then they can work
in a beautiful way."</TE>
<TE>   His silken cajoling of Jhabvala set a tone too. Merchant is known
as a tough negotiator who can get his way with his honeyed tones. The
gift seems inborn. "You have to be a super salesman," he says,
giggling. "I remember my college [dean] saying I could sell snowballs
to Eskimos."</TE>
<TE>   Ivory says of Merchant and Jhabvala: "We wouldn't have continued
in this partnership if we weren't all friends. We have the same ideas
about the films we want to make. No one wants to go off in some wild
direction. I won't be making, say, science-fiction movies."</TE>
<TE>   Ivory grew up in Oregon, where his father owned a lumber mill. As
a young man he visited India and Venice, Italy, falling in love with
both places and making short films about them.</TE>
<TE>   Merchant, the son of a textile dealer with a penchant for
gambling, aimed to become a Hollywood producer, and took an MBA
course at New York University. On reaching Hollywood, he found he
preferred European films and decided that he wanted to produce films
based in non-American cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Jhabvala's Jewish parents fled Germany in 1939, when she was 11,
and settled in London. She studied at London University, and at 24
married Cyrus, moving with him to New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   After Merchant Ivory's films gained momentum, the Jhabvalas moved
to upstate New York in the late 1970s. "We've been an itinerant
troupe," Merchant noted, though they spend part of the year living
close to one another, near the Jhabvalas.</TE>
<TE>   They have also been a troupe that has known fluctuating financial
fortunes. The year 2000 was a bad one for Merchant Ivory. The company
felt obliged to buy back its film of Henry James' novel "The Golden
Bowl" from Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein, who had demanded radical
changes, and resell it to another U.S. distributor for far less
money. Their decision landed them in a cash crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "But we did it because we believed in the integrity of the film,"
Merchant says. "Weinstein wanted the opening scene cut, and Uma
Thurman's character [Charlotte Stant] punished. He's a good marketing
man, but he doesn't know how to behave towards artists."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Weinstein calls Merchant Ivory "great filmmakers,"
but recently told New York magazine, "They need another person--and
it ain't me, because they don't trust me--that they listen to."</TE>
<TE>   Merchant Ivory had suffered money problems before. Two backers for
"Heat and Dust" abruptly withdrew 20 years ago, potentially
endangering the film. Ivory recalled that "in Italy, 'A Room With A
View' almost foundered a few weeks before shooting. We were in
Florence setting up, and our investors disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   Merchant Ivory always operates on the tightest margins possible.
Their highest film budget was a mere $16.5 million for 1996's
"Surviving Picasso," starring Anthony Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   Simply, they pay the people who work on their films as little as
possible. When Helena Bonham Carter, who appeared in "A Room With a
View" and "Howards End," presented them with lifetime British Academy
fellowships at the BAFTA awards earlier this year, she said of their
films: "You won't make much money, but you might win an Oscar."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins, interviewed by The Times in 1996 after "Surviving
Picasso," was more brusque. He called Merchant Ivory cheapskates.
"They have a very underhanded way of dealing with people," he
stormed, charging that they held back payments to gain interest.</TE>
<TE>   How, then, do their films look so opulent? "All the money has to
go up on the screen," Merchant says. "People have to work hard on our
films, harder than they would on others. We save wherever we can."</TE>
<TE>   I once saw this for myself. Arriving on the set of "The Remains of
the Day," I was shown around by Merchant--not usually a producer's
job. "Where's the unit publicist today?" I asked. "I am the unit
publicist," he said grandly. Of course: He could play host, a role he
enjoys, and save a salary.</TE>
<TE>   When costume designer and frequent collaborator Jenny Beavan
requested a budget for "Jefferson in Paris" that was deemed too high
by Merchant, he made her fly to India and have the costumes made up
of Indian fabrics at a fraction of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Although actors and crew may voice disaffection on the set, they
return to work for Merchant Ivory. The reason is obvious: Within
strict financial limitations, Ivory encourages them to do their best
work. His direction has advanced the careers of Hugh Grant, James
Wilby, Greta Scacchi, Rupert Graves, Simon Callow and others.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their struggles in raising money, and their advancing
years, the trio intends to carry on, now shooting "Le Divorce," with
Hudson, Watts, Matthew Modine and Sigourney Weaver.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be doing this till I go to my grave," Merchant says. "It
regenerates your youth and energy." Ivory has drawn up a short list
of Shakespeare plays he wants to adapt for film and will not discuss
retirement. "This is what I do," he said, shrugging. "And I can still
do it."</TE>

<HD>So Simple, Yet So Difficult to Arrive At</HD>
<DH>Maxwell Hendler often spent years on a painting. Gradually,
he turned to color only.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA- PHILP</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Maxwell Hendler's gray modern house, wedged between traditional
bungalows in South Pasadena, the living room tells the whole story.
On one wall hangs a 1982 watercolor of James Dean; on another, a 1985
orange-and-white-striped panel embellished with the word "gross" in
black. Over the sofa hangs a 1987 white construction of pilasters and
translucent fiberglass. Finally, in the corner, there is the most
recent work, a 2002 rectangle of eye-tingling magenta.</LD>
<LD>   This rough survey of Hendler's paintings from the past 20 years
chronicles a progressive embrace of simplicity. Gesturing at the
white construction, Hendler says, "This is where I started losing
imagery. I was trying to get to a kind of painting that keeps you
from drifting into another world, the world of illusion."</LD>
<LD>   Since the late 1980s, Hendler has perfected his technique for
producing paintings that simply embody color. A few weeks ago, his
studio was crowded with rectangles of various dimensions, radiantly
exemplifying chartreuse, aqua, cherry and ebony. They are now on view
at the Patricia Faure Gallery in Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   Hendler, 63, is relieved to be having an exhibition. Last fall, he
underwent hip replacement surgery. "It knocked me out for three
months," he says ruefully. "I didn't think I would have my show this
year. But in January, everything just fell together."</TE>
<TE>   Sturdily built and tanned, with gray hair and cognac eyes, Hendler
has come from his morning session of water aerobics. Wearing a plaid
shirt and jeans, he is only half-joking when he describes the hard
physical labor required to make his paintings. He pours layers of
intensely colored resin on panels of Masonite laid flat atop
sawhorses. His challenge is to saturate the resin with enough pigment
to attain electrifying intensity without breaking down the compounds.
If he pours the color over a white resin background, it becomes
slightly transparent. Otherwise, it's opaque.</TE>
<TE>   After he attains the desired hue, he sands the resin surface for
hours with a hand-held machine and stacks of sandpaper graded from
100, the roughest, to 2,000, which feels like velvet. Then he buffs
the surface with rubbing compound until the surface is as reflective
as a mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "The resin is surfboard technology," he explains, "the rest is
auto body technology."</TE>
<TE>   When finished, even the smallest panels weigh 50 pounds. He gives
these paintings tantalizingly personal titles, such as the large,
ocean blue "Hispanola" after the name of the ship in "Treasure
Island." Or "Au Contraire," because Hendler thinks of chartreuse as
an "in-between color."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past decade, these works have garnered raves from
critics. They have "a simple readiness about them that defies all
abstract pretension," Dave Hickey wrote in Artforum, "a refined
affability that reminds you, every time you look, that nothing in
this world with a body and color is ever as simple as you think it
is."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Hendler's journey to the current work was not simple.
"When I was young, I sat and painted all day," he says. "Now that I'm
old, I'm doing this stuff that is physically demanding. I got it
wrong somehow, but I'm compelled to do it. At this point, I don't see
an end to it."</TE>
<TE>   "Even as a child, I was Max the artist," says Hendler, sitting on
the sofa in his living room. Reared in Houston, he is the son of a
construction estimator and a housewife. But his parents' true passion
was the stage, and both were involved in the founding of the Alley
Theater. The family moved to South Pasadena, not far from Hendler's
current home, when he was 17. The following year, 1956, he enrolled
in the art department at UCLA with thoughts of working in
advertising. During his first year, he says, "it occurred to me that
I didn't want anybody to be my boss."</TE>
<TE>   Hendler graduated with a bachelor's degree in fine art in 1960 and
married a classmate, Arleen. Then the newlyweds moved to New York
City to be artists.</TE>
<TE>   "We were overwhelmed," admits Hendler. He worked for a printer in
the Bedford-Stuyvesant district, and at the end of one year, he says,
"my painting was at rock bottom."</TE>
<TE>   The couple returned to L.A., rented a house on Venice Beach, and
joined a community of artists that included Charles Garabedian and
Billy Al Bengston. Hendler went back to UCLA, but ultimately left
academia to paint on his own. Then he found himself spending as much
time in the local pool hall as in the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a dark night of the soul," he says now.</TE>
<TE>   Around that time, his mother gave him a box of drawings that he'd
made as a child. Leafing through them, he had an epiphany: "I
remembered the spirit in which I worked as a child. From that moment
until this, it hasn't left me. I think at UCLA and in New York, I
became overwhelmed by the greatness of art and art history."</TE>
<TE>   By 1965, Hendler was channeling his epiphany into one small
painting of his neighbor David standing in front of beach cottages.
The following year, he completed a 10-by-10-inch painting of his
dining room. "I started painting in realistic mode and the
inspiration stayed with me, to get enthralled with an idea and not
lose it," he remembers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967 he spent a year painting the television set in his cozy
living room, then spent two years on a painting of beer bottles.
These pictures--not more than a foot square--were intensely detailed,
partly inspired by northern Renaissance art.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hendler began teaching in the Cal State system and had
two daughters, Cara and Emmanuelle. With the added distractions, it
took him six years to complete his tour de force, the 10-by-12-inch
"Sandpainting."</TE>
<TE>   "For years, I sat at a table painting from a still life of beach
sand, bits of asphalt, kelp bulbs and a Kleenex box." Over and over,
he scraped the surface down and painted it again, creating depth and
dimension. "The sand painting became a bas-relief as well as
illusion; it came alive," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Two of these five intense paintings were included in the Whitney
Museum of American Art's show "22 Realists" in 1970. In 1975, all of
them made up a show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, however, Hendler chose to quit his
about-to-be-tenured teaching job at Cal State Long Beach, leave his
family and start a new life in Northern California. "I felt I had to
get away from it all," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Divorced and floating from Berkeley to Mendocino, mostly living in
an RV, he painted and sold modest watercolors: redwoods, rural
landscapes and still lifes.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1982, he moved back to L.A. "After five years, I had a
need of people again," he said. "I thought of all my friends in L.A.
and I thought I needed to get back to them and to my daughters, who
were then in junior high and high school."</TE>
<TE>   After his return, he says, "the work became Pop-y." He began
translating some of his watercolors into large-scale oil paintings,
beginning with the portrait of James Dean that now hangs in his
living room. He also painted the logo from a candy box and from
Israeli bubble gum.</TE>
<TE>   The logos gave way to paintings of words such as "gross" in 1985.
He selected "words that would in some sense dissolve and not lead
outside themselves in meaning." Along the way, the pictures grew more
reductive. "The imagery flattened, reduced and simplified itself. I
started to concentrate on the backgrounds," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Before the backgrounds took over as the entire picture, however,
Hendler did a series of architectural constructions using wooden
pilasters and corrugated fiberglass in 1987. He liked the look of the
fiberglass, which led him to pour lightly pigmented resin on clear
pine boards, so the grain of the wood could be seen beneath the tint.
"I was fascinated by the fact that I could create this transparency,"
he says. "That just haunted me, the idea of looking through."</TE>
<TE>   Since those experiments, he has continued to construct monochrome
panels with various levels of transparency. A few years ago, he began
the opaque monochromes.</TE>
<TE>   Now, when Hendler summarizes his trajectory to pure color, it's
all about freedom.</TE>
<TE>   He says he got lost in the world of the little paintings. "The
more I painted the same quarter inch over and over, the more real it
became," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Then, slowly, "I liberated myself out of the painting and into the
world. The things I'm making now, they live in my space; I don't live
in their space."</TE>

<HD>After the First 15 Minutes</HD>
<DH>As a critique of high, not low, culture, Andy Warhol's work
is just as relevant today</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I wish I hadn't made so many images," Andy Warhol fretted to a
reporter from The Times in 1970, the day before his first big survey
exhibition opened to the public at the Pasadena Art Museum. "I wanted
the Pasadena show to be one image--the wallpaper with the cow's
heads. One image. That would be nice."</LD>
<LD>   In hindsight, it's easy to see why the celebrity-mad Pop artist
thought it would be so nice to devote an entire museum retrospective
exclusively to that one image. The wallpaper features a shocking pink
bovine repeated against an electric yellow background. The jaunty cow
might at first look like Borden's Elsie, but the wallpaper is really
a cinematic self-portrait of Warhol. How it is, and why that meant so
much to him, are questions whose answers take a bit of explaining.</LD>
<LD>   Raised Byzantine Catholic, Warhol understood the power of an icon.
He had shown the wallpaper in a room by itself at New York's Leo
Castelli Gallery in 1966, and in 1968 he had used it to cover the
entire facade of the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, Sweden. But
Los Angeles was different. For Warhol, L.A. was Mecca. It was
Hollywood, where Marilyn, Liz and Elvis--stars of his paintings in
the 1960s--lighted up the silver screen.</LD>
<TE>   In 1965, just as his Pop art career was exploding internationally,
Warhol had famously announced in Paris that he was giving up painting
to focus on making movies. Warhol had become a star, but what he
really wanted was to direct.</TE>
<TE>   His work in underground films was flourishing. Cheeky pictures
like 1964's "Empire," in which the ironic subject of an eight-hour
motion picture was an utterly immovable object--Manhattan's phallic
Empire State Building--created a stir in the small arena of
avant-garde cinema. His 1966 epic, "The Chelsea Girls," became a
bona-fide art-house sensation, receiving wide distribution and
national press. An unscripted mix of documentary narratives about the
eccentric denizens of Manhattan's low-rent Chelsea Hotel, its reels
are projected in random order on two screens simultaneously, side by
side. "The Chelsea Girls" is Warhol's "Grand Hotel," playing out in
real-life reel life the famous epigram of that 1932 Hollywood
masterpiece: "People come, people go. Nothing ever changes."</TE>
<TE>   But the underground wasn't Hollywood, no matter how wide the
distribution. In spring 1969, Columbia Pictures approached Warhol and
his friend Paul Morrissey, and expressed interest in producing a
mass-market film. The title of the project Warhol and Morrissey
pitched was "The Truth Game," and the plan was to cast the beautiful
transvestite, Candy Darling as a Life magazine reporter who
interviews movie stars. Their proposal was soon rejected for "moral
reasons."</TE>
<TE>   For Warhol to return in triumph the next year with a lavish museum
retrospective starring the cow wallpaper would be sweet, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because Picasso, universally acclaimed the greatest artist of
the 20th century, had spent much of his career depicting himself in
the guise of a strong and powerful bull. The sexually voracious
Spaniard had executed hundreds, maybe thousands, of paintings,
drawings and prints of the potent male animal. They range from his
traumatic 1937 landmark, "Guernica," in which the mighty bull looks
on implacably at the convulsive chaos of war, to countless pictures
of Minotaurs in romantic, surreal and mythic narratives.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's quiescent cow, pretty in pink, was El Toro's feminine
alter ego. He repeated his cow persona hundreds, thousands of times
in a wallpaper pattern. Wallpaper was the taboo stuff of interior
decoration, the marginal art form to which women and gay men had been
restricted by a nervous sexist society. But its vertical lines of
repeated images also look like frames of film. Warhol didn't manage
to get a transvestite superstar into a mainstream Columbia film, but
the Pasadena show could be its own uptown Hollywood epic, starring
Warhol in famous-artist drag.</TE>
<TE>   The wallpaper plan, whether idly voiced to a reporter or actually
proposed to the museum, was not to be. The Pasadena show instead
included a full complement of Warhol's art of the 1960s. The cows
were there, but so were paintings of Jackie Kennedy in mourning,
colorful flowers in close-up, rows of Campbell's soup cans, electric
chairs in stark rooms, Brillo boxes piled high, tabloid photographs
of horrific car crashes, more conventional self-portraits and the
rest. All of these and more will be at the Museum of Contemporary Art
on Saturday. The mammoth Warhol retrospective, featuring more than
250 works from 1942 until his death at 58 in 1987, arrives from
London for a three-month run in Los Angeles, its only American stop.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the cow is as telling for Warhol's art as the bull is for
Picasso's. The same spirit that infused the wallpaper characterizes
almost all of Warhol's work from mid-1962 to 1968. Those five or six
years constitute his most brilliant, inventive and sustained period
as an artist--a torrent that was interrupted on June 3 by a
gun-toting crazy named Valerie Solanas, whose bullet to the abdomen
almost killed him.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's art is usually considered a commentary on the banality of
commercial popular culture. In fact, it harnesses the power of pop
imagery to articulate ideas about art. His greatest masterpieces are,
like his Picassoid cow, a virtual textbook of established assumptions
about modern art. The common cultural beliefs and artistic cliches of
the day, whether critically held by artists in their studios or
lackadaisically voiced by an indifferent American public, are
pictured in his sly paintings.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine anyone more ill-suited than Warhol for the
New York School of the '50s. He'd gotten a few small gallery
exhibitions, but his art career was going nowhere. Try to picture
Warhol--a shy, pallid, effeminate homosexual and one of the most
successful commercial artists in Manhattan--holding his own in a
drunken night of rough-and-tumble argument about avant-garde art at
the Cedar Street Tavern, the legendary downtown watering hole for
Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and other Abstract Expressionist
artists. ("How gay was Warhol?" asked poet Wayne Koestenbaum. "As gay
as you can get.") By 1960, postwar painting was exhausted, sliding
into the historical past, and debates were raging about what it
meant, where it was going, whether abstraction had a future and more.
What could Warhol do?</TE>
<TE>   In essence, what Warhol did as a painter in the 1960s was little
different from what he did as an award-winning illustrator for I.
Miller shoes and "Amy Vanderbilt's Complete Book of Etiquette" in the
1950s. He used painting to mount a veritable ad campaign, which
"sold" conventional ideas about the arcane world of avant-garde art.</TE>
<TE>   The vivid mythology of 1940s and '50s Abstract Expressionist
painting, which had catapulted American art into international
prominence, is central to Warhol's chosen imagery of the 1960s. If he
could successfully illustrate rules of etiquette and advertise
immaterial ideas about fashion, why couldn't he do the same for
existential dread and the established rules of advanced American
painting?</TE>
<TE>   Pop art is an inventory of New York School ideas about Modern art,
told in the visually exciting language of American mass media. Like
any ad campaign, it had a limited shelf life--in Warhol's case, less
than six years--before repetitiveness and musty familiarity set in.
But its success was staggering. The inventory is rich, so rich that
art has not been the same since.</TE>
<TE>   Any guide to what Warhol was selling, as well as how he sold it,
should start with his series of "do it yourself" landscape paintings.
Their designs were based on commercial paint-by-numbers kits, a toy
introduced in 1951 that soon became a national fad. Andy's
do-it-yourself paintings recognize the scornful popular assumption
that when it comes to Modern art, "My 5-year-old child could do
that!"</TE>
<TE>   Cliches and puns are essential to understanding Warhol. His
painted sculptures of Kellogg's Corn Flakes cartons make an awful
play on words: The artistic technique of repeating one form over and
over, pioneered by Impressionist Claude Monet in paintings of
haystacks, went by the name of serial imagery. Warhol used Kellogg's
for cereal imagery.</TE>
<TE>   Some pictorial puns were more obscure. Abstract Expressionist
artists sloshing paint around their canvases in the studio used a
variety of slang terms for the results--paintings that worked had
juice, those that didn't turned to soup. Warhol turned to Campbell's,
both for paintings of soup and painted boxes of tomato juice. (He
also did Mott's apple juice.)</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the Brillo box--an orator's soapbox, yes, but
more than that. James Harvey, a commercial graphic artist who also
had an active career as an exhibiting Expressionist painter in New
York, designed the Brillo box. Warhol, a successful commercial artist
who had a hard time getting anyone to take his art seriously, could
relate.</TE>
<TE>   He first displayed his black-and-white paintings based on dance
diagrams for the waltz, the fox trot and other ballroom favorites
flat on the floor, rather than hanging on the wall. They map the
agile movements of titanic "action painter" Jackson Pollock, who
"danced" around canvas spread on the floor and artfully dripped
paint. (One complex diagram also probably refers to "Tango," a 1955
painting by Jasper Johns.)</TE>
<TE>   Easel painting had been widely denounced in favor of big,
mural-size canvases, known as field paintings for their capacity to
encompass a viewer's field of vision. Big, bright color-abstractions
by Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis and Barnett Newman were said to
embody its most refined form. Warhol made Color-field paintings of a
rather more literal kind, reproducing a seed-catalog photograph of
colorful hibiscus flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Black paintings formed a subset within the abstract art of the
period. Pollock had made a controversial switch to black paintings in
1951, facing a creative block after his series of monumental "drip"
paintings. Ad Reinhardt made black squares his signature motif in
1956. Young Frank Stella was being hailed as the savior of abstract
art for a series of black paintings begun in 1958. Warhol made black
paintings too, but his were ripped from the headlines: race riots in
Birmingham, Ala., reproduced in a Life magazine photograph of a clash
between civil rights demonstrators and police.</TE>
<TE>   When he selected gory tabloid newspaper photographs of car crashes
to reproduce on canvas, he showed the violent means of death for
1950s cultural heroes, from Pollock to James Dean.</TE>
<TE>   One of Warhol's first Pop series used rubber stamps and a
silk-screen printing process to reproduce dollar bills on canvas.
Abstract Expressionism was the first modern American art movement to
establish a flourishing international market. American painting had
become currency. Andy started printing money.</TE>
<TE>   Ab Ex touted its rigorous commitment to subject matter that is
"tragic and timeless." Who fit that bill better than Marilyn Monroe,
the goddess suicide; Elizabeth Taylor, repeatedly hospitalized and
scandalously divorced; and Jacqueline Kennedy, America's stylish,
valiant widow? Marilyn, Liz and Jackie became Warhol's substitutes
for the powerful women featured in paintings by De Kooning, the other
artist-titan of the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The tragic and the timeless, with their overtones of death and
despair in the face of subjective individual freedom, were integral
to the existentialism so influential to abstract painters like Mark
Rothko and Clyfford Still. Warhol painted the bleak void where the
electric chair conferred America's final judgment on society's losers
(including 1950s "celebrity victims" like Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg). In the upper right-hand corner of the electric-chamber
photograph Warhol chose to reproduce hangs a blunt, admonishing sign:
It declares Samuel Beckett's famous "silence."</TE>
<TE>   Abstract Expressionism was infamous as a macho boy's club of
swaggering, hard-drinking men engaged in a pursuit--the arts--not
noted in American society as a masculine activity. Warhol pictured
the conflicted type: Marlon Brando, the tough-but-tender motorcycle
hood in "The Wild One," and Elvis Presley, a misfit pretty boy and
gunslinger in the 1960 western "Flaming Star" (a movie title that's
as gay as you can get).</TE>
<TE>   This mixture of masculine aggression and homoerotic desire proved
too much for the 1964 World's Fair, where Warhol's 25-panel
commissioned work depicting the NYPD's "13 Most Wanted Men" was
painted over by nervous officials of the New York State Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   The "Most Wanted Men" made an obvious pun on pinup boys. But they
also refer to Marcel Duchamp, the emigre French Dada artist newly
emerged from obscurity as a hero to a younger generation of post-Ab
Ex artists. His career was based on puns. Warhol met the living
legend in L.A. in 1963, just before he got the World's Fair
commission, when Duchamp was the subject of a celebrated
retrospective at the Pasadena Art Museum. The ad sheet for that show
took the form of a Wild West poster, featuring Duchamp's picture as a
wanted outlaw. It cited his alias as Bull.</TE>
<TE>   Bovine Andy wasn't alone in using the visual language of mass
culture to represent dead cliches about modern art and giving it
vivid new life in the process. Two others who did the same were Roy
Lichtenstein, working with comic books in New York, and Edward
Ruscha, working with graphic design and advertising techniques in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did current art events suddenly become his subject in 1962.
The year before, he had painted "Telephone," now part of MOCA's
permanent collection. It depicts an antique phone, the kind with a
separate earpiece and a mouthpiece on a stand, a model that had been
replaced by the then-ubiquitous rotary dial telephone. For a
mass-media world, a more blatant depiction of painting as an obsolete
form of communication is difficult to imagine.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-1962, "129 Die in Jet! (Plane Crash)" showed the June 4
cover of the tabloid New York Mirror. The tragic (if not timeless)
newspaper story had a veiled art connection, for a group of patrons
from the High Museum in Atlanta had been on board that fateful flight
from Paris. High art supporters were doomed.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone and plane crash paintings--like the 32 cans of
Campbell's soup with which Warhol launched his Pop career at L.A.'s
Ferus Gallery in 1962--were transitional works because they were
painted by hand.</TE>
<TE>   When he started printing movie star and money pictures, Warhol
moved in a direction Robert Rauschenberg was also taking. Warhol
began perfecting a silk-screen technique for printing photographs in
paint on canvas. Mass production merged with high art.</TE>
<TE>   Actual media images, which had previously had no aesthetic
legitimacy, began to occupy the privileged space of painting. Thus
did Warhol end a conflict between painting and photography that raged
since 1839, when fixed camera images were invented. Now, photography
was masquerading as painting. Warhol's photo silk-screen paintings
are art's equivalent to James Slattery all done up in drag as Candy
Darling.</TE>
<TE>   In the catalog to the show opening Saturday at MOCA, Kirk
Varnedoe, former curator at New York's Museum of Modern Art, writes
that Warhol's paintings show a taste for crude, anonymous,
out-of-date trash, like old product labels, seed catalog pictures and
B-movie stills. "This taste for the retrograde cliche was consistent
with a strain apparent in Modern art since Picasso began using
newspaper clippings in 1912, whereby the hot new art style of the
moment exploited the deadest and most shopworn elements of the
commercial culture around it."</TE>
<TE>   Varnedoe is right about Picasso, but he's only half-right about
Warhol. For Warhol's Pop uses those commercial images to take
advantage of the deadest, most shopworn elements of high culture. New
York School painting had been theorized as a heroic defense against
the degradation supposedly inherent in pop culture. The avant-garde
battled kitsch. But Warhol understood that a great Hollywood movie
(or a great work in any pop genre) is as culturally rich and
satisfying as a great painting--and equally as rare.</TE>
<TE>   As a functional worldview, the modern trait of assigning value
according to category--high art over low art, not to mention male
over female, straight over gay, rich over poor, religionist over
atheist, white over black/brown/yellow/red--was dead. (That's one big
reason death is the most common subject in Warhol's art.) Warhol was
the first court painter of American democracy. His cow outran the old
bulls of Picasso and even Duchamp. And that's why Warhol matters.</TE>

<DH>'Ally McBeal' and 'Felicity' became hits with young women
by cleverly camouflaging juvenile subjects. But the fans have new
waifs to worship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executives at the WB Network were so proud when the late-night comedy
"Mad TV" lampooned their new series "Felicity" that they screened the
sketch for visiting TV critics in January 1999. Not every program,
after all, generates enough buzz and discussion to make it a ripe
object for ridicule.</LD>
<LD>   In that respect, "Felicity"--the story of a pretty young girl who
makes the impulsive decision to follow a boy she barely knows to
college, skipping the opportunity to attend Stanford--clearly
achieved its place in the popular culture, just as "Ally McBeal"--the
story of a pretty young woman thrown together with a lost love who
happens to work at her law firm--had done upon making its debut a
year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   It seems appropriate, then, for these two series to exit the stage
together, with Fox's "Ally" bidding farewell Monday and "Felicity"
graduating from prime time two nights later. Each has had time to
craft what amounts to a finale, even if neither title character has
really completed her journey of self-discovery--the requirements of
series television being such that its denizens must appear to go
through major life progressions while essentially running in place.</LD>
<TE>   Call them girls, interrupted.</TE>
<TE>   And "girls," the feminist implications of the word
notwithstanding, is really the operative term here. Both Felicity and
Ally were and always have been girls--girls who fretted endlessly
(either via elaborate fantasies or taped voice-over self-reflection)
about girl things, girls who worried excessively about committing
faux pas around cute guys, girls whose world was seldom invaded by
any serious real-world concerns that reached beyond their personal
sphere.</TE>
<TE>   Young women and teenage girls flocked to the series, whose
engaging characters--coupled with their telegenic stars--propelled
the shows onto magazine covers and spurred heated debate about
everything from the length of Ally's skirts to Felicity's hair. Those
same WB executives who basked in critical response to their show, in
fact, later found themselves being grilled about whether they had
damaged the franchise irrevocably by allowing star Keri Russell, to
lop off her curly locks. Deluged by negative e-mail, an executive
half-jokingly told reporters that after the "Felicity" experience,
"nobody is cutting their hair again."</TE>
<TE>   Arguably, "Ally McBeal" had the more dramatic impact as cultural
phenomena go and certainly in terms of its commercial success. Almost
as soon as it premiered, Ivy League professors and female attorneys
were sought for comment about the show's reality or lack thereof and
what messages that might convey to the audience. One academic labeled
Ally a male fantasy, insisting that any thinking woman must despise
her because she was so un-liberated--an educated career woman who
still turned utterly goofy around guys.</TE>
<TE>   This attitude was understandable but dead wrong. Although both
shows were created by men (David E. Kelley in "Ally's" case, with
J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves dreaming up "Felicity"), for each show
the audience overwhelmingly consisted of women--particularly
demographically desirable young women (insert shot of network
executives salivating here), who saw their concerns and issues
reflected, albeit in exaggerated ways, in the characters' travails.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1998 interview, star Calista Flockhart--in one of those
classic examples of the media, grasping for significance, thrusting
actors into the role of sociologist--was asked to discuss the
politically charged response to her character. About the best she
could do was express mild bewilderment to see the show "being used by
people as a vehicle to talk about feminism."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley also winced at the thought that young women might be
patterning themselves after his creation.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone comes up to me and says, 'She's my role model,' I say,
'Don't,'" he said shortly before the show's second season. "While you
find her endearing this week, you may find her objectionable next
week. Ally is Ally. She's not supposed to represent a gender or age.
She's her own beast."</TE>
<TE>   Well, yes, but where's the fun in that? After all, you can't build
a "20/20" piece or Redbook article around a silly TV show designed to
do nothing more than entertain. It has to speak to "larger issues"
that women can relate to in terms of their own lives--the kind of
issues you can enlist experts, academics and women with no last names
("Debbie, 33, a dental hygienist who dates frequently") to ponder and
analyze at great length.</TE>
<TE>   The simple explanation--that these programs were well-written,
thoughtfully mixed comedy with drama and featured attractive
casts--was hardly sufficient to satisfy these needs. So Felicity and
Ally became icons, as well as commodities to be sold, marketed and
emulated, in the same way little girls want to grow up to be Barbie
or Pocahontas or Belle from "Beauty and the Beast." All that changes
is the nature of the fantasy and the cost and size of the
accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Sustaining such heat, however, has always been difficult,
especially with new series clamoring for attention and familiar plot
lines being pounded into submission. Where did "Felicity" have to go,
really, after exhausting every permutation of the Noel versus Ben
story, as the title character struggled to choose between two
potential paramours? In similar fashion, how long could Ally remain
jilted and lovelorn before trying the patience of viewers?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some of the latter show's problems weren't entirely of
its own making. Ex-beau Billy died because co-star Gil Bellows wanted
to move on with his career, while supporting player Robert Downey Jr.
proved unable to fight off his own inner demons, prompting the
somewhat awkward removal of a promising love interest for Ally. Small
wonder that audience fatigue set in, plummeting from nearly 14
million viewers a week during the 1998-99 TV season to 9.4 million
this season.</TE>
<TE>   What's perhaps more intriguing than the idea of "Ally McBeal" and
"Felicity" simultaneously ending with a bit of a whimper--Lord knows
the protagonists did their share of whimpering along the way--is the
fact that their demise appears to have been helped along by newer
examples of girls being girls.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, women, and especially those in the 18-to-34 age
bracket, have found new real-life "characters" to fret over within
the world of unscripted television. These viewers overwhelmingly
chose ABC's fabricated "reality" of "The Bachelor" over "Ally"
through most of April. After "Ally's" heavily promoted return with
"Friends'" Matthew Perry as a guest posted ratings as scrawny as the
show's namesake, Kelley and the network decided to throw in the
towel.</TE>
<TE>   "Felicity," by contrast, was never really a major hit, but it's
telling that one of the most popular shows to occupy the same time
period was last season's unscripted dating game, Fox's "Temptation
Island." For a time, the water-cooler chat among young women was
about whether Billy and Mandy would stay together, not Felicity and
Ben.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, "Felicity" represented a significant asset in the
maturation of the WB. Piling up rare awards for the network, the show
earned a Golden Globe for Russell in its first season, just as
"Ally's" Flockhart was so honored the previous year. (This is a
testament either to the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.'s ability to
tap into the cultural zeitgeist or the ability of fruit-and-cheese
baskets mailed out by the shows' studios to tap into the Hollywood
Foreign Press Assn.)</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it is a tribute to the writers and performers that
these series resonated as deeply as they did before television's
version of the Grim Reaper came calling. It's easy to forget how
grueling episodic television can be for character-driven series: They
risk boring viewers if the story doesn't advance or turning off a
sizable segment of their audience by hitting a sour note with some
new wrinkle.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's fair to say at this point that relatively few
steadfast fans will truly miss, mourn or pine for these programs, the
girls who embraced them having moved on to new pursuits. Soon enough,
some razor-thin waif, real or imagined, will infiltrate this
subculture, inspiring intense debate about her choices and hairstyles
and clothes--debate to be teased and strung out, programmers hope,
until said character can be assured of living on profitably in reruns
for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Networks, after all, will be networks, just as girls will be
girls.</TE>

<DH>A foundation helps artists while protecting Warhol's
reputation</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>One of Manhattan's least known architectural landmarks, the Bayard
Building near Washington Square, has all but disappeared behind
scaffolding while undergoing renovation. Few passersby even glimpse
the vertical terra cotta moldings and ornate reliefs on the facade of
the 1897 structure--much less guess that it's the only building in
New York designed by Louis Sullivan, the architect known as the
father of the skyscraper.</LD>
<LD>   Those who enter the building on Bleecker Street and take an
elevator to the seventh floor are in for another surprise. Here in a
7,500-square-foot, high-ceilinged space--divided into work stations
and bare-bones offices--is the nerve center of Andy Warhol's
philanthropic legacy. Money comes in from art sales, licenses and
investments. And money goes out to support contemporary art, freedom
of expression and scholarship on Warhol. Paradoxical as it may seem,
the artist who is sometimes dismissed as a flash in Pop art's pan has
gained lustrous stature through a high-minded nonprofit foundation.</LD>
<TE>   During his closely watched life, Warhol often answered reporters'
long, searching questions with a cryptic yes or no. At his death, in
1987, he left an enormous body of work with a brief directive to use
it for "the advancement of the visual arts." His family, friends and
business associates didn't have much to go on, but the Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts has become the nation's leading funder
of cutting-edge contemporary art. Since its inception in 1988, the
foundation has given $51.2 million in grants. An additional $6
million is budgeted for grants in the fiscal year that ends April 30,
2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy was an incredibly liberating force, and that creates the
framework for the foundation's philanthropic efforts," said Joel
Wachs, the longtime Los Angeles city councilman and contemporary art
collector who moved to New York and became president and CEO of the
foundation last October. "He really represented democracy in terms of
being yourself and valuing diversity. In his name and his spirit, we
want to help provide opportunities for creative people to make and
show their work, whether it's popular or not, without the pressures
of government support. We try to nurture an environment from which
future Andys will come."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation--which got $25.3 million in seed money from a 1988
auction of Warhol's personal collection--has had a tumultuous
history. But it has come a long way since its birth, when Warhol's
close friend and advisor Frederick W. Hughes established it with the
help of Vincent Fremont, a longtime colleague, and John Warhola, the
artist's brother.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to be nimble, engaged, not stuffy or bureaucratic,"
said Archibald L. Gillies, who served as foundation president from
1990 to 2001 and played a major role in shaping its programs. But
first Gillies and his colleagues had to not only organize mountains
of Warhol's art, archives and related possessions, but also fend off
a batch of lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The worst was a court battle instigated by Edward W. Hayes, an
attorney for Warhol's estate and the foundation who claimed that the
estate had been grossly undervalued and that he was owed a percentage
of it amounting to $16 million. After eight years of countersuits and
appeals, Hayes was forced to repay the foundation some of the fees
already paid him.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such distractions, the foundation managed to give away
$1.8 million to $2.5 million annually during its first seven years.
And the sum has grown steadily since then.</TE>
<TE>   "Arch Gillies deserves a lot of credit," said Werner H. Kramarsky,
the foundation's board president. "In the early years, he was an
embattled person in a difficult situation. There will always be
intellectual property lawsuits; those go with the territory. But when
Arch left, he had disposed of all the troublesome lawsuits. The
foundation was as solid as could be. Joel came in with a wonderfully
clean slate."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation gives grants to cultural organizations, not
individual artists, but the money funds projects that benefit artists
as directly as possible, program director Pamela Clapp said.</TE>
<TE>   She and two associates travel widely to "seek out the best and
brightest people involved in contemporary art at a range of
institutions, from contemporary art museums to artist-driven
organizations that give artists their first opportunities to show
their work," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the foundation focuses on innovative work by young
artists and welcomes challenging projects with political or social
content, it also funds new scholarship on established figures. The
last round of grants includes a $30,000 award to the Esperanza Peace
and Justice Center, a San Antonio arts organization that focuses on
women, for its "Exhibiciones Activas" series on the art of four
Latinas; $50,000 to the Maine College of Art in Portland for its
"William Pope.L: eRacism" show, featuring the politically charged
work of a performance artist; and $60,000 for an artist-in-residence
program at Spaces, a community art center in Cleveland. In the past,
the foundation has given the nod to everything from public art in
Miami to a digital film project at the Museum of Jurassic Technology
in Culver City and "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera, 1962-1972," a
traveling exhibition of Italian art currently on view at the Museum
of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to grants for specific projects, the foundation has
launched the Warhol Initiative to help struggling arts organizations
become self-sufficient. Each year, eight organizations are awarded
about $100,000 apiece, along with professional assistance to help
them use the money productively. This year's recipients include two
of L.A.'s community art centers, Self-Help Graphics in East Los
Angeles and Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also leverages its funds by working with other
organizations, Wachs said. In a response to the elimination of the
National Endowment for the Arts' grants to individuals in 1996, the
Warhol Foundation's leaders rallied a consortium of 20 foundations
and individuals to establish Creative Capital.</TE>
<TE>   Launched in 1999--with major funding and office space provided by
the Warhol Foundation--the independent fund provides artists with
direct financial aid and technical support to develop projects and
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most other grant-making foundations, the Warhol Foundation
earns the bulk of its income--and simultaneously builds a cash
endowment--from the sale of art created by a single artist. At the
same time, the foundation does "everything possible to secure his
reputation and create a much broader and greater depth of
understanding of the body of work he created," Wachs said.</TE>
<TE>   One monumental project is a six-volume Warhol catalogue raisonne.
The first volume, a lavishly illustrated tome covering paintings and
sculpture from 1961 through 1963, has just been published. But for
those who want to see the actual works, the most extensive repository
is the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the artist's hometown.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, two years after his death, the foundation signed a joint
venture agreement with the Dia Center for the Arts in New York and
the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh to establish the museum. It
opened in 1994, stocked with a foundation gift of 3,200 Warhol
works--800 paintings and more than 1,000 drawings, along with prints,
films, video and audiotapes, and the artist's extensive
archive--valued at more than $61 million. Dia contributed 150
additional works by Warhol; Carnegie secured funding for the facility
and administers the museum.</TE>
<TE>   To improve other American museums' holdings of Warhol's work, in
1992 the foundation sold 103 works to 24 museums at undisclosed
prices, said to be about half of market value. Meanwhile, Vincent
Fremont, who worked closely with Warhol for 20 years and now has an
office in a cavernous space above a Diesel clothing store on Union
Square, has negotiated hundreds of sales from the foundation's
collection. Initially the exclusive agent for all the work, Fremont
now handles paintings, sculpture and drawings, while an associate,
Tim Hunt, sells prints and photography. All sales are approved by the
foundation's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't call me for '60s paintings," Fremont said. The most
valuable works are long gone, in sales that yielded $23.1 million in
1998, $31.2 million 1999, $29 million in 2000 and $23 million in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   But the foundation still has about $28 million of Warhol's work,
stored at a warehouse-like facility in Chelsea, where chief curator
Claudia Defendi presides over a staff of seven curators and art
handlers.</TE>
<TE>   As Warhol's artistic legacy dwindles in the storerooms, it feeds
the foundation's coffers. Over the years, the art assets have been
converted into an endowment, which has grown to $120 million. That's
still relatively small in the world of charitable foundations. The
Pew Charitable Trusts, for example, has $4.3 billion in assets; it
gave $230 million in grants last year, of which $24.5 million went to
a broad range of cultural institutions and programs.</TE>
<TE>   But Warhol's pot of gold is likely to grow considerably with the
development of another source of revenue: a line of products that
incorporates Warhol's name and images.</TE>
<TE>   Far beyond the art-inspired mugs, T-shirts and refrigerator
magnets commonly sold in museum shops, some of these products are
already available in Los Angeles at MOCA's store in conjunction with
the "Andy Warhol Retrospective," which opens Saturday. There are
denim purses decorated with sequined dollar signs, beaded evening
bags adorned with the image of a high-heeled shoe or a Campbell's
Soup can, drawstring totes in the shape of soup cans, silver rings
with inset flowers and  light-switch plates covered with grids of
Elvis Presley portraits.</TE>
<TE>   It's only a sampling of an enterprise masterminded by Martin
Cribbs, the foundation's licensing director. While all the products
come with a tag extolling Warhol as "the preeminent American artist
of the 20th century" who "challenged the world to see art
differently," Cribbs said he has targeted "20-year-olds who see Andy
Warhol as a sort of rock star," along with many other consumers who
are not part of the usual contemporary art audience.</TE>
<TE>   "If you only look at Warhol in the hallowed halls of museums, you
miss the enormous influence he has had on popular culture," he said.
"That has great resonance for everybody, so we try to capitalize on
it."</TE>
<TE>   While many products shout "Warhol," others incorporate
little-known images in relatively subtle ways. "Consumers who buy
this don't know it's Andy Warhol. They just think it's cute," Cribbs
said of a large glass bowl adorned with a cherub, manufactured by
Rosenthal AG in Germany. "The market is so competitive, we can't
count on selling a product with Andy Warhol's name alone."</TE>
<TE>   To deal with that competition internationally, the foundation has
entered into a partnership with the Beanstalk Group, which promotes
such brands as Coca-Cola and Harley-Davidson. As the exclusive
licensing agent for Warhol products in North America and Europe,
Beanstalk will market a wide array of products including dinnerware,
bedding, wallpaper, jewelry, clothing--some of which have been
developed for specific markets. One style of jeans--jointly licensed
with Coca-Cola and decorated with that company's wavy red stripe on
one back pocket and a graffiti-like Warhol signature on the opposite
pant leg--is sold only in Germany. A line of bathing suits is
exclusive to Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Sensitive to possible charges of exploitation and
commercialization, the board of directors has created a special
committee to "keep a tight rein" on licensing, board President
Kramarsky said. "That doesn't mean we won't get criticized, but it
you think back to Andy, he was perfectly happy to use any image any
way." What's more, he said, licensing revenue "supports the visual
arts, particularly younger artists and younger institutions, and
makes a very direct effort to protect artists' freedom of expression
at a time when that is quite often under attack."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond adding up the money-in and money-out totals, how can the
Warhol foundation's impact be measured?</TE>
<TE>   East L.A.'s Self-Help Graphics, a grass-roots printmaking workshop
and gallery, has operated for nearly 30 years on a shoestring budget,
and its share of Warhol largess is only beginning to be felt.
Receiving a $100,000 Initiative grant is both an honor and godsend,
executive director Tomas Benitez said.</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity came as something of a surprise. Potential
recipients are invited to apply for grants, which pay for basic
"capacity-building"--including technical assistance, office
equipment, endowments, mortgage payments and cash reserves. Self-Help
sent in its application and hoped for the best. Once it "won," the
workshop and gallery began working with the foundation to set up a
specific plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an enlightened approach," Benitez said. "It compels a
dialogue that might not take place naturally, where key staff, key
board members and artists talk with a consultant about how to put
these resources to best use. We have to ask ourselves how we can use
this money to serve artists better and add to the cultural
landscape."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the final plan, the Warhol Initiative's stamp of approval
is almost as big a shot in the arm as the much-needed money. Call it
the 15-minutes-of-fame effect: "It  gives us cultural capital,"
Benitez said, "as we talk to people about what we do and why it's
important."</TE>

<HD>The Fight for the Right to Copy</HD>
<DH>If the Supreme Court reverses a copyright extension act,
there could be significant implications for movies</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1998, Congress passed the Sony Bono Act (sponsored by the late
congressman), extending the copyright on everything from movies to
literary and musical works from 75 to 95 years. The sweeping measure
guaranteed, for another generation, that the creators and owners of
20th century works and their heirs would have exclusive control over
their presentation and use.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court, however, recently decided to review the
extension, questioning how long the original artists and their
estates should artistically control and financially benefit from a
work. The court review, the result of a challenge filed by an
Internet archivist, raises several questions about the fate of all
kinds of creative properties, motion pictures in particular.</LD>
<LD>   If the court strikes down the extension, F. Scott Fitzgerald's
novel "The Great Gatsby" and Walt Disney's original Mickey Mouse
renderings would soon enter the public domain and copies could be
freely disseminated in book and video stores, and over the Internet.
Almost all American-made films from the silent and early sound era
and musical works from the same period would be accessible to anyone
for any use.</LD>
<TE>   In the case of movies, the original negatives--which usually
provide the highest quality source for reproduction--would still
reside with studios and independent companies that previously held
the copyright. Ostensibly, this would provide enough incentive for
studios to preserve the movies, but the opposite has more often been
the case, if you believe those who side with Jack Valenti, president
of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, who has lobbied for the
extension vigorously on behalf of the major studios. Even if multiple
copies of a movie are available in the public domain, studio
executives such as Amir Malin, chief executive of Artisan
Entertainment, contend that "whoever owns the best materials will
still be able to best exploit works that then fall into the public
domain."</TE>
<TE>   An example cited on both sides of the argument involves Frank
Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life." Opponents of copyright extension
claim the movie would have continued to gather dust in a vault if the
copyright hadn't expired. Because it fell into the public domain,
numerous television stations began to broadcast the film. What was a
commercial disappointment at the time of its release was transformed
into a Christmas favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Those who favor copyright extension contend that because the film
was free for anyone to copy, numerous video companies were able to
exploit the Capra classic, and the market was flooded with versions
of varying quality, often extracted from old 35-millimeter and
16-millimeter prints. When Republic Pictures discovered a way to
regain control of the property and renew the copyright (by tying up
the rights to a piece of music used in the film), the company also
gained a financial incentive to restore Capra's movie and distribute
high-quality videocassette, DVD and television versions. "It's a
Wonderful Life" was rediscovered by a new generation of critics and
filmgoers and, according to Malin, sells in excess of 750,000 videos
every year. Video sales were nowhere near that level when numerous
poorer-quality versions were available in public domain.</TE>
<TE>   "People who don't want extension to occur make a number of
perfectly valid arguments concerning access to important intellectual
works," says Roger Mayer, president of Turner Entertainment, which
purchased the MGM library in the mid-1980s and is now part of AOL
Time Warner. For example, despite the fact that MGM popularized "The
Wizard of Oz" for several generations through its 1939 musical, if L.
Frank Baum's original series of "Oz" books was not in the public
domain, the costs of obtaining permission to produce more recent
stage, film or TV versions might have been prohibitive.</TE>
<TE>   However, says Mayer, "the perception is that if a movie falls into
public domain, it's more likely to be preserved. Exactly the opposite
is true."</TE>
<TE>   Older film titles, most of which are in black-and-white, can cost
anywhere from $25,000 to $250,000 to restore and remaster. Then there
are problems of maintaining, storing and marketing the film. Without
deep pockets, the return on such an investment--particularly for less
conspicuous titles--is just not there.</TE>
<TE>   "As it is, archives and preservation foundations have limited
funding," says Richard P. May, vice president of preservation at
Warner Bros. "Imagine how much would be needed if all the films of
the 1930s [Hollywood's so-called golden age] were to fall into public
domain."</TE>
<TE>   Due to oversights in copyright renewal, many films from that
period, such as the original 1937 version of "A Star is Born," are
already out of copyright and lack the backing to be properly
restored. The burgeoning DVD market has given some of these films a
new lease on life. Recently, specialty video company Navarre Corp.
introduced the first group of about 40 planned titles on DVD,
including "A Star Is Born," "Metropolis," "Nosferatu," "A Farewell to
Arms" and "Little Shop of Horrors."</TE>
<TE>   None of these titles is derived from negatives, says Joyce Fleck,
vice president of marketing at Navarre, but the company has tried to
access the best available existing prints of these films. Sold in
groups of three for $9.99, Fleck says any compromises in quality are
more than offset by the bargain prices. Whether you agree depends on
how much of a stickler you are for video and audio quality.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, other companies have released video versions of
movies--foreign titles, for example--that were either temporarily in
the public domain (the 1949 British film "The Third Man," Fellini's
1957 "Nights of Cabiria," the early Alfred Hitchcock films) or owned
by companies that were lax in enforcing their copyright (some Ingmar
Bergman movies). "Many of the people in the public domain business
are pirates and take the chance that the copyright owner is looking
the other way," says Steven Riforgiato, vice president of sales and
marketing at Home Vision Entertainment/Criterion.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, it was mistakenly thought that Universal's 1962
romance "Charade," starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, was in the
public domain, resulting in substandard video versions of the movie.
"Universal had to go after them," Riforgiato says. Through an
agreement with the studio, his company restored and remastered
"Charade" as well as other specialized titles from the studio's
library, including "The Last Temptation of Christ," "The Scarlet
Empress" (this one from the pre-1948 Paramount library, which
Universal owns), "Brazil" and "Spartacus."</TE>
<TE>   HMV/Criterion prefers not to work with public domain titles
because they wouldn't have access to the original negative. The
company's quality restoration from original materials, however, comes
at a price. Its video and DVD titles are usually more expensive than
comparable studio releases, although they often include special
materials. Riforgiato says his main audience is the film buff who
places a premium on quality.</TE>
<TE>   The mass market may not be as discriminating, Warner Bros.' May
contends. A flood of older movie titles into the public domain could
result in lucrative product, not only for discount video
distributors, but independent television stations looking to fill
programming schedules with cheap programming. Exposure to bad movie
transfers could diminish, rather than enhance, the overall value of
the work, he argues.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the copyright extension counter that the studios have
created a smoke screen, and that, particularly in the digital age,
the tools are available for less expensive ways to restore and
preserve movies. Continuing to extend the copyright hampers the
rediscovery and exploitation of less commercial films and the works
on which many are based. Some companies, such as Turner
Entertainment, have refurbished all the materials in their libraries,
according to Mayer. Others pay close attention only to their top
commercial titles.</TE>
<TE>   Malin says that of the 6,700 titles in the Artisan library--a
collection of works from various companies mostly made in the last
half of the 20th century--only about 600 or 700 are commercially
viable.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer says that even movies that don't appear to have much
commercial potential are worth preserving. For instance, a few years
ago, Disney purchased the rights to remake MGM's 1950 film "Father of
the Bride." The redo, which starred Steve Martin, was so successful
that it enhanced the value of the original on home video and
television.</TE>
<TE>   "There are valid arguments on both sides," says Lou Petrich,
partner in the law firm of Leopold, Petrich &amp; Smith who specializes
in copyright issues. "The court doesn't like monopolies but has [in
the past] agreed to limited monopolies as an incentive for authors to
create new works."</TE>
<TE>   The fear is that by upholding the 20-year extension to 95 years,
the court would continue the monopoly on creative works and open the
door to further lobbying at the end of that period for yet another
congressional extension.</TE>
<TE>   The argument goes beyond the Davids and Goliaths. Besides
protecting the interests of studios and major film companies, the
copyright law also ensures that underlying rights holders--authors,
playwrights, composers and their heirs--benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Studios don't always own underlying rights on intellectual
properties for indefinite periods. This applies to literary
adaptations and even musical compositions. "We may have a limited
right with an author lasting maybe 10 years," explains May. After
that, the studio has to negotiate to extend the agreement, as MGM did
with the Irving Berlin estate on the 1950 film version of "Annie Get
Your Gun." Depending on the contracts, if rights are not extended,
the movies may have to be taken out of circulation.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole purpose of the copyright was to encourage people to
create artistic works by giving them significant exclusivity," May
says. "And there are a lot of authors who, over the years, have not
wanted their work to be translated into another medium. I'm not sure
that's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Capping the copyright at 75 years (and 50 years after an author's
death), would open the door to a slew of novels, plays and musical
compositions created in the '20s and '30s, denying the creators'
heirs financial remuneration or artistic control over how the work is
distributed or adapted.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment Goliaths would also be at odds with one another.
If vintage studio films were in the public domain--as well as the
source materials (original screenplays, adaptations, novels, musical
works)--competing companies would be able to refashion them into new
works for stage, screen and television.</TE>
<TE>   But how many generations of heirs should enjoy the fruits of an
author's labors before everyone is allowed free access? If Charles
Dickens' novels were still under copyright and his estate proscribed
any film or theatrical versions of his work, wouldn't the public be
poorer as a result?</TE>
<TE>   As some argue was the case with "It's a Wonderful Life," the
expiration of exclusivity could lead to their rediscovery. For now,
the current 95-year copyright (and, in the case of some authors, even
longer) is in keeping with intellectual property rights recently
established in many parts of Europe, copyright attorney Petrich
points out, and rescinding the 20-year extension could place American
works at a disadvantage. The Supreme Court's decision to look into
the 1998 law, Petrich notes, indicates there is at least some support
for overturning it.</TE>
<TE>   The matter will be argued this fall, with the final decision
expected by the end of this year or early next year.</TE>

<HD>A Drought in Shanghai</HD>
<DH>Once known as the Hollywood of China, the city is now a
conservative center that's inhospitable to filmmakers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>After graduating from the prestigious Beijing Film Academy five years
ago, Ma Ning landed a job in Shanghai. It might as well have been
Siberia.</LD>
<LD>   "I had no idea Shanghai was such a cultural desert," said the
37-year-old, a producer at the state-owned Shanghai Film Studio.</LD>
<LD>   But Ma believed that China's most modern city was too exciting a
place to be relegated to the backwaters of Chinese filmmaking.</LD>
<TE>   The local movie industry is facing a crisis of survival. American
pictures are practically the only films with drawing power at the box
office. China's recent entry into the World Trade Organization means
Hollywood will fight harder to dominate the local market.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, some of the best works by Chinese directors are
banned in China and available only at overseas festivals or art
houses.</TE>
<TE>   Shanghai is the mother of Chinese cinema. More than any other
city, it has the potential to make movies that are both politically
viable and profitable. It's a do or die situation, Ma Ning thought.
So he published a manifesto, asking Shanghai to again make cinema
history and reclaim its role as the Hollywood of China. "I wanted a
revolution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, he's embarrassed by his own naivete. The
promising young filmmakers he inspired got fed up with fighting the
system and decided to shoot lucrative television commercials instead.
Ma's only feature film died on the vine.</TE>
<TE>   His experience highlights Shanghai's transformation from one of
Asia's most dynamic and daring cultural hot spots to an unexpected
pillar of censorship and conservatism.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake, Shanghai is China's showcase city--a breathtaking
economic miracle and a magnet for dream-seekers near and far. But
Shanghai has lost its edge as the country's cultural center. Here,
where capitalism, not communism, appears to reign supreme, the party
still maintains an iron grip on the arts. The city is acutely aware
that its social stability is paramount to the welfare of the entire
country. Thus, Shanghai has perfected the art of control and
self-censorship.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the creative climate here proved so stifling, the finest
artistic talents have fled. Their counterintuitive new home is up
north, in the capital, Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "More than 100,000 of the county's best actors, directors and
other aspiring filmmakers are congregated in Beijing," said He
Zizhuang, a screenwriter at the Shanghai Film Studio, describing the
phenomenon called beipiao, or northern drift. "They are there because
it's the home of other talented people. It's the center of China's
culture and power. Shanghai just can't compare."</TE>
<TE>   Despite mind-boggling changes during two decades of economic
reforms, the Communist Party remains the final arbiter of the arts in
China. It still sees movies as a powerful propaganda tool too
important to leave to the whims of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Beijing, the nerve center of the party, has managed to
offer relative freedom to its artists.</TE>
<TE>   "People from Beijing love to talk politics and critique society,"
He said. "But people from Shanghai have little desire to speak their
minds. They are more interested in business, in fashion. If you have
nothing to say, what's the point of making a film?"</TE>
<TE>   The downgrading of Shanghai to cultural irrelevance is a direct
result of a power shift after the Communists took over this gigantic
nation of farmers. Essentially, that meant the triumph of peasant
culture over urban culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Half a century of revolution has indeed destroyed in toto China's
urban culture, together with its cosmopolitan sensibilities," said
Leo Ou-fan Lee, professor of Chinese literature at Harvard University
and the author of "Shanghai Modern," a 1999 history of Shanghai's
urban culture between 1930 and 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the early part of the last century, Shanghai was the brave
new world that defined China's liberation from the shackles of rural
tradition and backwardness. Artists and intellectuals from around the
country flocked here and thrived during a moment of exhilarating
change.</TE>
<TE>   They embraced the accouterments of modernity, from cafes to cars,
from capitalism to communism. And they loved the cinema. As the
birthplace of the Chinese film industry and home of its biggest
stars, Shanghai built some of the world's most splendid Art Deco
movie houses. The motion picture flourished here in the 1930s as an
irresistible medium of the times.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of Chinese films back then reflected life in
Shanghai," said Xu Yuan, founder of Studio 101, a local film club.
"There was no other Chinese city capable of representing modern
life."</TE>
<TE>   After 1949, however, China's new peasant rulers thought otherwise.
The old port city reminded them of the twin evils of capitalism and
colonialism. Shanghai practically vanished from films except as a
negative caricature.</TE>
<TE>   Famous filmmakers and movie stars fled the country. Many of them
continued their craft in Hong Kong, building a vibrant film industry
there in Shanghai's image.</TE>
<TE>   One of the better known is the Shaw Bros. studio, which started
out making silent films in Shanghai. It went on to Hong Kong to
produce classic martial arts movies, influencing cult figures from
actor Bruce Lee to director John Woo. But those who remained on the
mainland suffered, particularly under the vengeful hands of Madame
Mao Tse-tung, who was a fledgling actress here back in the 1930s
under the stage name Lan Ping.</TE>
<TE>   Culturally, Shanghai stagnated. Its new role was as China's
industrial powerhouse, filling the national coffers with tax dollars
and keeping a low profile.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the early 1990s, Shanghai became a workhorse with a
different saddle, as Beijing resurrected it as the country's
financial capital.</TE>
<TE>   Shiny new buildings as befit a capitalist stronghold shot up,
including a state-of-the-art opera house, a modern museum and
U.S.-style multiplexes. Hoping to cash in on China's most lucrative
box office, Warner Bros. is planning to open a nine-screen theater in
Shanghai's shopping mecca.</TE>
<TE>   But all that points to this city emerging as an ideal market of
cultural consumers, not producers.</TE>
<TE>   "Shanghai was always at the forefront of filmmaking in China,"
said Stanley Rosen, political science professor at USC and an expert
on Chinese film. "There is no sign of it happening at this point.
Maybe in the very long run."</TE>
<TE>   Today, despite Shanghai's image around the world as China's
trendiest city, there are surprisingly few Chinese films that feature
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "In Hong Kong, they have Wong Kar-wai. In Taiwan, they have Edward
Yang," said Xu, referring to the respective makers of the
award-winning films "In the Mood for Love" and "Yi Yi." "They are
like New York's Woody Allen. When will there be a Chinese director
famous for shooting urban stories about Shanghai?"</TE>
<TE>   Blame it on a debilitating system of censorship and control, which
many filmmakers say is worse in Shanghai than Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a city that from a distance looks like a place with
limitless opportunities. But get close, and you'll find there are
walls everywhere," said Yang Lu, a freelance film critic. "We will
never become a movie center until all the conservative officials
retire."</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese compare bureaucratic hurdles to a landscape of
mountains and valleys. It is easier to get things done in Beijing
because many government agencies work like valleys between the
mountains. If one doesn't work, try another or do without. But there
are few ways in Shanghai to slip into a valley.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, if I get a script and don't like it, there's no way
it could get made," said He, who screens movie proposals. "There is
only one film studio in Shanghai. In Beijing, they have other
options."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help that Shanghai's artistic gatekeepers harbor a
reputation for being notoriously image-conscious but risk-averse. The
result is a city that knows it could raise its profile with flashy
international film festivals. But city leaders don't seem to realize
that Shanghai's image is at stake if they promote mostly boring
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Local filmmakers have little room to maneuver. In a recent movie,
a Shanghai family coped with life after losing state jobs. The
otherwise mainstream film got the green light in Beijing but hit a
wall in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   "The officials didn't like it because it showed the family
cleaning their bedpans on the street," said Wu Hehu, a manager at
Paradise Film, the city's only film distributor. It was told to
abandon the project for fear of being seen as promoting a negative
image of China's wealthiest city.</TE>
<TE>   Some local filmmakers have simply given up trying to show the real
Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born and raised here, but I never had the desire to write
about it," said He of the Shanghai Film Studio. "A lot of people like
me don't see the romance and mystery outsiders see."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the city's rise as an international center of commerce may
be incubating a new breed of filmmakers. They are mostly amateurs
working outside the system, working on digital video without
government approval or funding.</TE>
<TE>   They want to show the seedy side of the shiny coin: the drugs,
trauma, AIDS, suicide and a whole host of other vices plaguing the
city's listless youth.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of Westerners know China" through celebrated director Zhang
Yimou's historical films," said Andrew Cheng, whose debut film,
"Shanghai Panic," is a digital video production loosely based on a
short story by Shanghai's "bad girl" author, Mian Mian. "When they
see my movie, they can't believe this is China, that this is
Shanghai." The film depicts a group of young Shanghainese dealing
with alienation, HIV and homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Cheng has shown his version of the city at local bars and schools
and plans to take it to film circuits outside China, including L.A's
Gay and Lesbian Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   For now, it has little chance of reaching a larger domestic
audience. But many hope that the Shanghai story, in all its splendor
and shame, may yet inspire a new wave of Chinese filmmakers. "The
past 20 years of reform in China has been a collective process of
urbanization," Cheng said. "The dawn of a new era in Chinese film
will start with a new way of making urban movies about Shanghai."</TE>

<DH>To give audiences a better idea of one person's work, a
piano student used his own money for a concert series</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When pianist Steven Niles saw a gap in the Los Angeles classical
music scene, he decided to ante up his own money to fill it.</LD>
<LD>   "Los Angeles is a good city for new music generally, but there was
nothing here like this--a composer portrait series," Niles said in a
recent interview from his home in Simi Valley. "The idea is to
feature an evening of one composer's works, sometimes two."</LD>
<LD>   Niles' idea blossomed into Music of Changes, a five-concert
series, named after a work by John Cage, that ends its first season
Thursday with a program devoted to New York composer Roberto Sierra.</LD>
<TE>   Niles, who functions as both the artistic director and the
executive director, is all of 26, a piano performance major doing
graduate work at USC's Thornton School, where he's studying with
soloist and longtime USC professor Daniel Pollack. Pollack is on the
Music of Changes board, which also includes composers (George Crumb,
Rodion Shchedrin, Lalo Schifrin, for instance ) musicians (pianist
Raymond Beegle) and one critic (Alan Rich of the LA Weekly). The
budget is about $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is not affluent," Niles said. "I just put in my life
savings, though I didn't expect to. I discovered after I committed
that the first two years of nonprofit organizations are very
difficult for fund-raising. People want to see a track record."</TE>
<TE>   To pick the composers, Niles announced a competition at about
1,000 music schools and through the American Music Center, a New
York-based national service organization for new music.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition does two things for us," Niles said. "It gives us
a broad sampling of all the music out there and also it helps us
fund-raise. We charge an application fee of $40. That's enough to put
on one concert."</TE>
<TE>   He decided to ask each composer for one piece scored for the
ensemble of instruments based on the set Schoenberg used for "Pierrot
Lunaire"--flute, clarinet, piano, violin, viola, cello and voice,
plus percussion and up to two other performers. Niles and colleagues
from USC and CalArts perform the music.</TE>
<TE>   "We chose that instrumentation because of its versatility and
because so many new pieces are scored for that kind of ensemble,"
Niles said. "The piece could be a solo or something for the entire
ensemble or some denomination of it. There was no time limit for a
piece."</TE>
<TE>   The call for entries yielded 102 scores, often with sample
recordings, from seven countries. "We didn't pay much attention to
the bios," said Niles, who judged the entries along with other board
members. "Mainly, we just listened, with an eye to which pieces would
make for a good overall concert, an entire concert, based on our
subjective sense.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a wide range of different styles and forms. We were
struck by the amount of melodrama. There was a certain amount of
atonal music, it's not exactly serial. And a lot of neo-tonal music
and everything in between.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very impressed, in general. The overall level of
competence seemed to be very high. It was difficult to choose. But
there was something about each of these composers who stood out."</TE>
<TE>   The series opened in October with the music of French-born
Philippe Bodin and continued with British-born Peter Child
(December), British-Australian composer Chris Dench (February) and
Colombian composer Alba Potes (April).</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of Roberto Sierra," Niles said, "one of the things
that impressed us was that all his pieces seemed to be so balanced in
their structure. They all seemed to be the perfect length."</TE>
<TE>   For the series' concerts, Music of Changes also commissioned a new
work from each composer. Sierra's new piece is called "Turner," after
the English painter.</TE>
<TE>   "Turner has always fascinated me because of his use of color and
his wild imagery," the Puerto Rico-born Sierra said recently from
Ithaca, N.Y., where he has lived since joining the faculty of Cornell
University in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "I based each one of the sections in this piece on one of his
paintings. I had a painting in front of me and tried to derive the
inspiration for the harmonies, the rhythms and the colors from the
paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "Music is more abstract than the visual arts and a more private
thing in the end than anything else. But a point of departure is
Turner's paintings, and I hope that translates into the music."</TE>
<TE>   Other Sierra works on the program will include "Concionero
Sefardi," the piece he submitted for the competition, and "Piezas
Imaginarias," "Ritmorroto" and Cello Sonata.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning the competition was a pleasant surprise," Sierra said. "I
had forgotten I had submitted the piece. I always move onto the new
work. I wrote this awhile ago. But this is an interesting group from
the standpoint of a composer. They have a very reasonable board."</TE>
<TE>   Music of Changes is filming all the concerts, and the footage will
be edited into a single program set to air in July on the Ovation,
Knowledge and Wisdom networks, which have limited cable and satellite
availability in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Audience development has been difficult but steady," Niles said.
"We've had the concerts on different nights every time. We are
beginning to discover which days of the week are best. Thursday seems
to be the good day, so far." The idea is to offer the series every
two years, with a new competition determining the participants for
each season.</TE>
<TE>   "But it depends entirely on funding," Niles said. "If we can raise
funding sufficiently to do it, we will announce a new competition in
October."</TE>

<HD>Label Has Just One Requirement: Sell 10,000</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Island Def Jam Music Group gambling $20 million on Mariah
Carey after she was paid more millions to leave Virgin Records, it's
clear that the major labels are more ready than ever to risk their
resources on acts with potential album sales of millions.</LD>
<LD>   Marc Geiger's new label sets its sights a bit lower.</LD>
<LD>   "If you can sell 10,000 records, you're in if you want to be,"
says the music business veteran, whose iMusic venture will officially
launch this summer.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the ability to sell a minimum of 10,000 CDs is the only
criterion for label candidates. Geiger doesn't care what style of
music you make, what age demographic you appeal to, whether you can
dance or what language you sing in.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not even saying, 'If your record's good enough, we'll sign
you,'" he says.</TE>
<TE>   The way to make this work, Geiger says, is to keep costs low. The
label is not offering big advances to artists, nor will it propose
expensive promotional campaigns for mainstream radio and TV exposure.
What it is offering artists is full ownership of the master tapes,
total creative control and a 50-50 split of net revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Contracts will be only for one album, and expenditures will be
made only with full agreement between the artist and the company.</TE>
<TE>   Geiger has already had several notable takers. John Doe, the band
Berlin, rappers Tre (from the Pharcyde) and Speech (from Arrested
Development), and English band Gene have all signed on, with 20 more
in negotiations, he says, adding that the approach is particularly
suited to artists who have had some level of mainstream success and
major-label support in the past and retain a reliable following but
who no longer fit in the major-label and mainstream radio world.</TE>
<TE>   Doe is using the label to release his first acoustic-based solo
album, "Dim Stars, Bright Lights," with such friends as Aimee Mann
and Jane Weidlin in guest roles and plans for an August release. The
onetime Geffen and Elektra artist says he has no problems with the
smaller scale of the plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to a point pretty quickly where I wanted to make records,"
says Doe, who remains a member of L.A. punk leader X. "I didn't want
to wait for someone else to say I could. Maybe there is an ego
hurdle, but not for anyone who's a true creator. If I had the
opportunity to work with a major label, I would probably do it. On
the other hand, I don't think I would get as good a record or be as
satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   iMusic is part of a bigger company with major distribution
(through BMG), and can operate in effect as a "hybrid" of indie and
major services.</TE>
<TE>   Geiger says that iMusic is a fulfillment of ideas at play at
ARTISTdirect, a company he co-founded six years ago as an
Internet-heavy platform for music acts. It's had ups and downs, but
has maintained a leading presence in developing artists' Web sites
and fan databases. It presaged iMusic by releasing albums by acts
ranging from Mann to Cher.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, ARTISTdirect started a joint venture with Interscope
Records founder Ted Field to create ARTISTdirect Records, a label
vying to compete on the major scale. Geiger, who is vice chairman of
ARTISTdirect, believes the time is better than ever for a label that
can target what he sees as an increasingly overlooked but extremely
fertile "middle ground" of the music business. Geiger has assembled a
small staff for iMusic, but will be able to draw on resources of the
bigger label, if appropriate, on a project-by-project basis.</TE>
<TE>   "When Ted came in with the traditional record business, we could
also be in the middle ground as part of this company," Geiger says.
"So we actually have a choice for artists, depending on who they are,
where they are in a career and what kind of deal structure they
want."</TE>
<TE>   MOCKERS: Jimi Hendrix, the Who and members of the Beatles are the
leading subjects of this year's annual Mods &amp; Rockers Film Festival
saluting '60s music figures.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast premiere of a new Hendrix documentary, "Blue Wild
Angel," opens the two-week series June 27 at the American
Cinematheque's home, the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, focusing on
the late musician's final major concert appearance at 1970's Isle of
Wight Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "How I Won the War" (Richard Lester's satire starring John
Lennon), "The Magic Christian" (starring Ringo Starr alongside Peter
Sellers), and "Wonderwall" and "The Family Way" (featuring musical
scores by George Harrison and Paul McCartney, respectively) screen on
June 29--the first time the four solo film-work debuts of the Beatles
will be shown together, according to Mods &amp; Rockers co-producer
Martin Lewis and cinematheque program director Dennis Bartok.</TE>
<TE>   June 30 will be an all-day Who showcase--conveniently timed for
the day before the group's Hollywood Bowl concert. Featured will be
"Tommy" and "Quadrophenia," plus the documentaries "The Kids Are
Alright" and "Listening to You," the latter covering their 1970 Isle
of Wight performance.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other films in the event will be Led Zeppelin's "The
Song Remains the Same," "A Celebration at Big Sur," "The Mini Mob"
(featuring a pre-"Saturday Night Fever" score by the Bee Gees) and
the 1970 Polish film "Deep End" (with music by Cat Stevens and German
band Can). More information can be found on the Internet site
www.modsandrockers.com.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Timbaland is overseeing the debut of his brother,
Sebastian, with Bubba Sparxxx, Ms. Jade and Petey Pablo all making
appearances. The album is due in late summer from Timbaland's
Interscope-distributed Beat Club label, with a single, "Special," to
precede it.... Yolanda Adams has recorded the vocals for "If We Could
Remember," which will be the featured song on the soundtrack to the
thriller "Sum of All Fears." Paul Williams wrote the song and Trevor
Horn produced, with an album (primarily featuring the score by Jerry
Goldsmith) due from Elektra Records on June 4, and the film (which
stars Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman) premiering May 31.... Old 97's
leader Rhett Miller is finishing work on his debut solo album, "The
Instigator," in Los Angeles, with Jon Brion producing. The two are
handling most of the instrumental duties, with Damon Gough (Badly
Drawn Boy) and Robyn Hitchcock offering guest vocals and Jim Keltner
and Josh Freese manning the drums on some tracks. The album is due
Aug. 27.</TE>

<LD>**</LD>
<LD>   JUANES</LD>
<LD>   "Un Dia Normal"</LD>
<TE>   Surco/Universal</TE>
<TE>   This may sound selfish, but Latin music would be a lot better off
if Juanes had not fallen in love. At least not the banal,
moon-and-June (luna-y-fortuna) sort of love gooping up the
much-anticipated second album by Colombia's acclaimed
singer-songwriter. This uninspired follow-up will leave fans yearning
for the depressive, angst-ridden, nihilistic Juanes whose brilliant
and provocative debut, "Fijate Bien," earned seven much-deserved
Latin Grammy nominations last year.</TE>
<TE>   Now we get generic romance from Juanes, homogenized for safe
consumption. Gone are the deep soulfulness and razor-sharp social
conscience of "Fijate Bien," the stunning work that brought sudden
international fame to this once obscure rocker from Medellin. Gone
too, surprisingly, is the mournful accordion of Chelito de Castro, a
fellow Colombian who gave such a distinctive, folkloric flavor to the
first album.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent attempt to go commercial, Juanes has groomed his
punky hair, and tamed the stark accents and rich, rhythmic textures
that so powerfully underscored his edgy, uncompromising vision.
There's still a hint of the old, urgent Juanes in the anthem-like
opening single, "A Dios le Pido" (I Ask God). But the album quickly
sinks into the laid-back, '70s soft rock of "Es Por Ti" (Because of
You) and the bouncy but annoying ditty "Luna" (Moon).</TE>
<TE>   There are some interesting string touches and plenty of pleasant,
radio-friendly melodies here, as in "Fotografia," a sweet duet with
Nelly Furtado. But we expect more insight and originality than Juanes
offers in the title cut (translation: A Normal Day) with this cliched
clunker: "You never know what you have until you lose it." Grandma's
old folk saying applies ironically to the artist himself.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   MARC ANTHONY</TE>
<TE>   "Mended"</TE>
<TE>   Columbia</TE>
<TE>   The salsa-pop star's second English-language collection (in stores
Tuesday) is what you'd expect from a romance-oriented heartthrob in
the post-teen-pop marketplace, but this overblown and undistinguished
material does little to showcase whatever gifts the New Yorker may
have.</TE>
<TE>   These smooth ballads and dance tunes have a vaguely Latin flavor
(mostly in the rhythms and occasional flamenco-like guitar lines).
But generally "Mended" is as slick as any Backstreet Boys album, if
somewhat more adult-contemporary around the edges.</TE>
<TE>   As vulnerable and sincere as any swoon-able modern crooner on such
sparkly numbers as "She Mends Me" and "I Need You," Anthony is more
engaging on the upbeat "I've Got You." Still, it sounds as if he's
having a lot more fun with the Spanish version ("Te Tengo Aqui"),
which is the most appealing track here. But from a
non-Spanish-speaking viewpoint, maybe it's just that Anthony's
personality comes through better when you can't understand the
distractingly predictable and shallow sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps he too often assumes personae that don't really agree
with him. Certainly his attempt to sound tough with the thumping
"Don't Tell Me It's Love" isn't even as hard-hitting as 'N Sync's
"Bye Bye Bye." And despite his breathless testifying, the declaration
of individuality "I Wanna Be Free" comes across merely as desperately
bombastic.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   THE FLATLANDERS</TE>
<TE>   "New Again"</TE>
<TE>   New West</TE>
<TE>   The Flatlanders came out of west Texas in the early '70s with the
raw talent and strong musical viewpoint to have possibly been a
revolutionary force in country music. But the group's folk- and
blues-accented style was so far from what pop-conscious Nashville
music powers wanted that the group's debut album was only released on
eight-track tape, which was already a largely discarded format.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock went on to become
cult heroes on their own. That first acoustic album was reissued
under the title "More a Legend Than a Band" by Rounder Records in
1990, and fans of the three singer-songwriters have longed wistfully
for a reunion effort.</TE>
<TE>   "New Again" (in stores Tuesday) is that reunion, and if some
generic tunes keep it from being the consistent knockout of our
dreams, the highlights will likely top almost anything we'll hear out
of Nashville this year. Ely is a honky-tonk rocker, and he is so much
at home on the spirited "I Thought the Wreck Was Over" that you can
see why his admirers stretch from Willie Nelson to Keith Richards.
Hancock is the introspective balladeer, and he is most effective on
"Yesterday Was Judgment Day."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore sings in such an ethereal, otherworldly manner at times
that he comes across as a sort of cosmic cowboy. In "My Wildest
Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day," he asserts the restless independence
and philosophical questioning that link the three artists' thematic
vision: "I wake up in the morning, I go to sleep at night/Somewhere
in between the two, I swear I'll get it right."</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO</TE>
<TE>   "By the Hand of the Father"</TE>
<TE>   Texas Music Group</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a play's musical score works best for those who have
seen the source production and can fill in the emotional spaces
between the songs. But this collection stands on its own, a moving
and absorbing record that faithfully captures the epic sweep of the
immigrant story at the heart of the Theresa Chavez play of the same
name. (Chavez is the wife of The Times' daily Calendar editor, Oscar
Garza.)</TE>
<TE>   Although the work was originally staged in Los Angeles two years
ago, this album (in stores Tuesday) marks the first time its
exquisite music is available on CD. The songs are woven together here
through short, spoken segments that effectively synthesize the story
of a Mexican immigrant who flees revolution to work hard and raise a
family in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   What's surprising is that a tale so familiar and commonplace (and
occasionally corny) can still be so touching. Credit largely goes to
the evocative, spellbinding instrumental score, a rich, sweet,
soulful blend of American country and folk with Mexican flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these songs have appeared on Escovedo's solo albums, but
the narrative context elevates them to a special strength, and
tenderness. When the old immigrant laments the end of his marriage in
"59 Years" and remembers the promise of young romance in "Inside This
Dance," the immigrant experience strikes a universal human chord, and
it's hard to hold back tears. --A.G.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   VAN MORRISON</TE>
<TE>   "Down the Road"</TE>
<TE>   Universal</TE>
<TE>   At 56, the legendary Irish singer-songwriter is in a contemplative
mood. Reflecting on where he's been and where he's going, Morrison is
wistfully pragmatic rather than downbeat, and he musters much more
emotional conviction than he did on his last collection of new
material, 1999's "Back on Top."</TE>
<TE>   Morrison offers the usual significant-to-him lyrical references,
wails away on harmonica and provides an eccentric reading of "Georgia
on My Mind" to underscore his irrepressible whims. Neither slickly
modern nor resolutely old-fashioned, the music has a good-natured
feel, blending New Orleans R&amp;B-bluesy ramble, traditional and pop
jazz and a dash of country, with Morrison playing much acoustic
guitar and a little alto sax.</TE>
<TE>   The cover photograph of albums in a Bath music store's window
display serves as a found gallery of Morrison's affections. And the
title song sets the theme, as he sings of an itinerant artist's
circular journey--endlessly traveling, always seeking the path home
and along the way collecting moments that compel him onward. His
lines are tinged with a world-weariness that isn't defeated but still
conveys a longing for better days.</TE>
<TE>   "Meet Me in the Indian Summer" is suffused with nostalgia-tinged
anticipation, like a yearning for one last beautiful display before
decay really sets in. Yet Morrison is in no danger of succumbing to
humorless sentimentality, as the wry "Whatever Happened to PJ Proby?"
celebrates his determined singularity through a rumination on other
oddball pop personalities.</TE>
<TE>   --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Dave Alvin &amp; the Guilty Men, "Out in California," HighTone.
"Recorded Live in California," it says on the back cover, like a
proud point-of-origin sticker on an orange crate, and the
collection's one new song is a homesick howl from a Californian stuck
in Nashville. This brisk overview of the invaluable L.A.
singer-songwriter's career, recorded at shows in Santa Barbara, Long
Beach and Pasadena, frequently ventures beyond the stage of the
Golden State, but that theme is a sustaining framework through songs
associated with the Blasters, X and Alvin's solo work. His band is as
sturdy and sharp as a rebuilt Chevy, shifting effortlessly from
downbeat to ebullient, and sorting smoothly through the rock,
country, blues, gospel and folk styles ordered up by this master
storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   *** The Breeders, "Title TK," Elektra. Kim Deal is a natural: an
unlikely rock star with a honey-coated rasp and a flair for
blissfully jagged pop patterns. Her powers of D.I.Y. dissipation are
undiminished on the Breeders' first album in eight years (in stores
Tuesday). Minimalist tracks "T and T" and "Son of Three" reach back
to the band's little-noticed debut, when the Breeders were just a
Pixies side project no one expected to find on MTV. No one should
expect it now either, but instead embrace the rough edges and weird
vibes for the beautiful noise they make.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Bryan Ferry, "Frantic," Virgin. Following up his 1999
collection of '30s-jazz-style romantic standards, the former Roxy
Music frontman offers a wider-ranging album that encompasses past and
present while committing to neither. Unified by Ferry's jaded
torchlight crooning, "Frantic" (due Tuesday) veers, at times
jarringly, from '80s rock anthems (co-penned by Eurythmics' Dave
Stewart) to country blues to such sprawling, Roxy-esque numbers as "I
Thought," co-written by and featuring ex-bandmate Brian Eno.</TE>
<TE>   -- N.N.</TE>
<TE>   *** Sunday's Best, "The Californian," Polyvinyl. Free of the
self-absorption that occasionally bogged down its debut, this Los
Angeles foursome follows up with a collection filled with
irresistible hooks and engaging anecdotes. Ed Reyes' radiant vocals,
appended to driving guitar lines, propel Sunday's Best far beyond the
merely pleasant. The band performs Thursday at the Troubadour in West
Hollywood before settling in for the residency on Monday nights in
June at Spaceland in L.A. Kevin Bronson</TE>

<TE>   "I don't even know when I ever had that ring. I didn't play in the
game because of a neck injury. The rings, the trophies, I've only got
a couple of those things left. They never meant much to me."</TE>
<TE>   But, almost $40,000 ...</TE>
<TE>   The great man laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "They can keep the ring. I wish I had the money."</TE>
<TE>   NFL players now consider life wasted unless it results in a Super
Bowl ring the size of Idaho. Hornung reminds us that once upon a
time, in an America far, far away from today's, the work itself meant
more than a symbol of the work.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a friend of Hornung's said, "If you really want to know
what Paul's about, ask him whatever happened to his Heisman
[Trophy]."</TE>
<TE>   At Notre Dame, Hornung played quarterback, halfback and fullback.
He ran, passed and blocked. He punted, kicked off and kicked field
goals. He ran back punts and kickoffs. In those one-platoon days, he
also played safety.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Irish won only two of 10 games in 1956, Hornung's
mastery was so complete and so sensational that he won the Heisman
Trophy as the nation's outstanding college player.</TE>
<TE>   So, Paul, whatever happened to your Heisman?</TE>
<TE>   "I did sell that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Hornung sold the trophy (for a reported $250,000)
to "the nicest guy in the world, a big ol' Irishman from upstate New
York," a restaurateur named Joe Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   At The Stadium, a restaurant and bar in Garrison, N.Y., Walsh "has
a sports shrine with Joe DiMaggio stuff, Mickey Mantle, lots of mine,
including signed jerseys and my Heisman."</TE>
<TE>   Such a story, the odyssey of Paul Hornung's Heisman. It began on a
rooftop in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Hornung and her 2-year-old son, Paul, lived in a rented
room at the front of a little white frame cottage in the city's
working-class Irish west end; they slept on cots. When the Ohio River
flooded in 1937, water reached the cottage eaves. The mother carried
her boy to the roof. They were rescued by a man in a rowboat.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever her son did after that, Loretta Hornung loved. She
remembered that after football practice at school he rode his bicycle
home five miles to play in a hospital yard across the street.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved playing football twice a day," she told a reporter in
1986. "The day of the game was kind of a letdown."</TE>
<TE>   She sent her son to a Catholic high school, Louisville Flaget, and
wanted him to attend Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom made sure I studied enough," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From South Bend, he hitchhiked home. Even as a Packer, he spent
offseasons at his mother's. He took her to dinner every Wednesday.
The centerpiece of her home was her boy's Heisman Trophy--until the
sad day when Notre Dame asked/demanded its Heisman winners bring the
trophies to South Bend for display.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother would never have forgiven me if I'd just taken it
away," Hornung said. "So I got another one made and gave that one to
her. Then, later, Notre Dame sent the trophies back to us. That's how
I wound up with two Heismans, the original and the copy."</TE>
<TE>   Along came the New York restaurateur Joe Walsh, who'd heard the
story of two Heismans. He bought the original. With the money,
Hornung did a thing that no doubt would have pleased his mother, now
dead. He created The Paul Hornung Scholarship for Louisville and
southern Indiana students at Notre Dame. Nine students have received
Hornung scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a lot of letters from fans," Hornung said. "The letters
that mean the most to me are from those kids so thankful, saying that
without the scholarships, they couldn't have gone to Notre Dame."</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier life, the prodigal playboy Paul Hornung might have
found a different use for the money. We may imagine him lighting
cigars with Ben Franklins. Even in his AARP age, we're happy to
report, Hornung is not fully tamed.</TE>
<TE>   Listen ...</TE>
<TE>   When Shane Matthews, a quarterback of no distinction, asked the
Redskins earlier this month if he could wear their No. 9 jersey, as
he had done in college and with the Bears, he did it innocently
enough. He also did it ignorantly, for the last man to wear No. 9 in
Washington was a quarterback of distinction, Sonny Jurgensen, who
could throw a tight spiral 50 yards behind his back.</TE>
<TE>   "Jumpin' Jehoshaphat," Paul Hornung did not say; he chose,
instead, a phrase just as colorful and less printable.</TE>
<TE>   He did say, "Shane Matthews better throw a few hundred more
touchdown passes before he even thinks of wearing Sonny's jersey.
Look, I can throw better than Matthews. Right now."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, at age 66, he still is The Golden Boy.</TE>

<HD>It's All in the Family for Drew</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Younger brother of pro players is a standout
shortstop at Florida State and has scouts thinking he might be the
most talented member of family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENT KALLESTAD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>When he left Florida State in 1997, J.D. Drew was the hottest
prospect in baseball. Five years later, many of the experts are
wondering if his younger brother might be even better.</LD>
<LD>   At the plate, Stephen Drew looks a lot like the star outfielder
with the St. Louis Cardinals. In the field, Stephen's a shortstop and
plays that key defensive spot extremely well.</LD>
<LD>   Although he missed 28 games early in the season with a broken
foot, the 19-year-old freshman anchors Florida State's defense and
ignites the offense.</LD>
<TE>   Drew has committed only four errors and leads the team with a .390
batting average. He's hit 11 home runs and has driven in 41 in 32
games as the Seminoles' leadoff hitter going into a weekend series at
Clemson.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy who can beat you more ways than one," Florida State
Coach Mike Martin said. "He's a difference maker."</TE>
<TE>   Drew has hit game-winning home runs twice this season. The first
was a three-run shot to defeat Miami in a 13-inning game in April;
the second was a two-run homer over the center field fence last
weekend in the bottom of the ninth to beat Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   A compact six-footer, Drew models himself after his older brother.
At the plate, the two left-handed hitters have nearly identical
swings. Both run out their home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to showboat, and you never know if the wind takes it
and it hits the wall or something," Stephen said. "Something like
that could be the difference in a game."</TE>
<TE>   J.D. hit 17 home runs as a freshman at Florida State in 1995, but
played a full schedule. He finished his three-year Florida State
career with 69 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "J.D. says he's better, but I like to have a little fun and say
I'm better," Stephen said. "One day, I just hope I can be."</TE>
<TE>   While their styles may be comparable, their personalities are
different. Martin describes Stephen as a more fiery player.</TE>
<TE>   "J.D. would come back to the bench after popping up and calmly put
his bat in the rack and be ready to go the next time," Martin said.
"There is a lot louder bat putting away and helmet putting away with
the other one."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen doesn't mind trying to live up to his brother's reputation
at Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   "If I get thrown in the spotlight, then I get thrown in the
spotlight," Drew said. "I'm my own player."</TE>
<TE>   And he has a chance to do something neither J.D. nor any other
Seminole baseball player has ever done at Florida State: win a
national championship. The Seminoles begin postseason play in the
Atlantic Coast Conference tournament that starts Tuesday in St.
Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning seems to follow him everywhere he goes," J.D. said of his
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Their middle brother, Tim, pitches in the Cleveland organization.
The two oldest boys were both first-round draft picks.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen was drafted by Pittsburgh in the 11th round last year, but
he had dreamed of playing at Florida State, where he'd come to games
as a junior high student to watch his older brother.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. angered Phillies fans when he sat out a year in a contract
dispute after Philadelphia picked him first in the draft in 1997.
He's happy his brother chose college.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's going to make him a lot better in the long run," said
J.D., who re-entered the draft and was taken by the Cardinals in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressures of a high schooler going to the minor leagues and
playing 140 games a year, and if you ever lose yourself and get down
on yourself, you might not ever make it to this level," he said. "At
least he'll have something to draw from when he comes out of
college."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Drew, who went straight from high school to the minors, has
struggled at the major league level.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen, known as "Dirt" to his teammates, liked nothing better
than hanging out with his older brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Being the youngest, they gave me a hard time, but they also made
me work to get where I wanted to get to," Stephen said.</TE>
<TE>   And for right now, that's at Florida State.</TE>

<HD>Hampton Sinking Under Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN MOSSMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Expected to be the answer to the Colorado Rockies' pitching woes when
he signed with the team before the 2001 season, Mike Hampton has
become the $12-million question.</LD>
<LD>   Not even a victory Thursday could disguise Hampton's sustained
struggles.</LD>
<LD>   After starting his Rockies' career with a 9-2 record and an
All-Star berth, he has gone 7-16 since then, including a 2-5 record
and 6.32 earned-run average this season. While still nominally the
team's ace, he has been only its fifth-best starter.</LD>
<TE>   The left-hander who signed the richest contract ever offered a
pitcher in December 2000--an eight-year deal totaling $121
million--entered Thursday's game having allowed the most earned runs
of any pitcher in the NL.</TE>
<TE>   And while he pitched no-hit ball for five innings Thursday in a
10-3 win over the Florida Marlins, the signs of distress were still
apparent. He walked five batters, including the leadoff batter in the
fifth before Eric Owens ruined the no-hit bid with an infield single.
Two batters later, Hampton lost his shutout, too.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was wild enough to where they didn't know if I was
going to throw a strike or not, basically, and that worked in my
favor for five innings," Hampton said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would call him effectively wild," pitching coach Jim Wright
said. "Sometimes that's good. His ball was moving all over the place.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though he gave up a couple more runs in the eighth, he was
aggressive and went after the hitters."</TE>
<TE>   His recent problems surfaced when he lost that bulldog intensity,
becoming tentative and toothless.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to work on staying aggressive," he said. "I think that's
what hurt me earlier this season. I was picking and picking, instead
of saying, `Here it is guys. If you can hit it, hit it. If not, I'm
going to beat you.' That's how I've always been. For some reason, I
got away from that.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just got to go after guys with my best stuff. I'm not going
to throw balls down the middle. I'm not going to give in. When I
start giving in, that's when I start giving up a lot of runs and
hits. I'd rather stay aggressive and make them hit my pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Being aggressive enabled Hampton to post a 22-4 record and 2.90
ERA with Houston in 1999. The following year he went 15-10 and led
the New York Mets into the World Series, going 2-0 and pitching 16
scoreless innings in the NL championship series against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed attitude seems to be working of late, helping Hampton
reduce his ERA from 10.26 after three starts to 6.32 after nine
outings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to remember that pitch," Hampton vowed.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton has heard the trade whispers, but he insists he believes
the Rockies can still win and wants to be a part of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't worry about things that are out of my control," he said.</TE>

<DH>With more than $70 million to spend, Utah will try to
increase its role as a site in Olympic sports training and
competition</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM KORTE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Utah Olympic Oval has become a cavernous refrigerated warehouse.
The chirps of spring songbirds have replaced cheers that echoed off
the mountainside at the Utah Olympic Park.</LD>
<LD>   These sleeping Olympic venues will awaken again, though, because
of $70 million in support funds that guarantee Utah's role as a
winter sports training and competition center for decades.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to continue growing winter sports in Utah," said
Randy Dryer, chairman of the Utah Athletic Foundation. "History tells
you that the growth of sport is directly related to accessibility to
facilities."</LD>
<TE>   Three months after the 2002 Winter Olympics, the festive
decorations and crowded streets are memories, and Salt Lake City is
back to the relatively quiet city it was before the games.</TE>
<TE>   But two mammoth facilities--built for speedskaters, bobsledders
and ski jumpers--aren't going anywhere. To the U.S. Olympic
Committee, each venue is golden.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did American athletes haul many of their Winter
Olympics-record 34 medals from the oval and the frozen track, but
both will be used as training sites.</TE>
<TE>   Facilities exist in Lake Placid, N.Y., site of the 1980 Winter
Games, but that's a five-hour drive from New York City. The nearest
airports are Albany, N.Y., and Montreal, each about two hours away.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Utah venues are in the middle of an urban area
with a population of 1.7 million. Salt Lake City offers the
conveniences of any large American city.</TE>
<TE>   "To have the facilities near a city such as Salt Lake, with good
universities and a big airport in such close proximity, it gives us
an opportunity we've never had," USOC President Sandy Baldwin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this will allow us to become a winter sports power for
years to come," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic oval is located in suburban Kearns, and the Olympic
park, near Park City, is 30 minutes from Salt Lake City. Both venues
are booked for World Cup and national races in coming years,
including the 2005 luge world championships.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an informal agreement with Lake Placid to alternate U.S.
nationals in various disciplines," Dryer said. "There will always be
at least one national championship in Utah each year."</TE>
<TE>   The venues also have begun youth programs to cultivate aspiring
speedskaters, figure skaters, hockey players, lugers, bobsledders,
ski jumpers, aerialists and mogul skiers.</TE>
<TE>   The expectation is that more Utah residents will take roles on
future U.S. Olympic teams.</TE>
<TE>   Yukio Griffall fits the bill perfectly. Born in Salt Lake City,
the 17-year-old played football, baseball and soccer when he was
younger but tried luge after Utah won the bid for the Olympics in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for this park, I probably never would have gotten
involved in luge," Griffall said. "After I started luge, it kind of
took me over. Since then I haven't really played any team sports."</TE>
<TE>   The trade-off was worth it to Griffall. Last season he and his
partner, Dan Joye of Carmel, N.Y., won the doubles junior world
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the two tracks in the U.S. is right in my back yard,"
Griffall said. "It only takes half an hour to get up there and slide.
A lot of athletes wouldn't get that opportunity, to be up there six
days a week."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Bergoust knows building good facilities can produce medals.
He won the gold in men's aerials at the 1998 Nagano Olympics, part of
an American sweep along with women's champion Nikki Stone.</TE>
<TE>   Bergoust credits practices at the Utah Olympic Park jump pool,
where in midsummer tourists often snap photos as Olympians soar off
ramps and splash into the training pool.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a direct link between our facilities and our results,"
Bergoust said. "It's by far the best summer aerials facility in the
world, and I can get there from my house in less than five minutes on
my motorcycle."</TE>
<TE>   Grand as they are, Bergoust feels the speedskating oval and the
bobsled-luge-skeleton run and ski jumps in Utah are good starting
points.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sport needs more small facilities," said Bergoust, a two-time
World Cup champion. "Put a small ramp into a lake, where kids could
get started. It would go over great in a ski town, maybe 5 to 10
ramps, small cheap ones."</TE>
<TE>   The oval and park are financed by a $40 million endowment,
overseen by the Utah Athletic Foundation. It was built into the Salt
Lake Organizing Committee's budget to assure no state money was
needed for a post-Olympic bailout.</TE>
<TE>   The news got better last month when the Olympics turned a $56
million profit, generating another $26 million for the foundation.
Then the International Olympic Committee donated its $4 million share
of the surplus.</TE>
<TE>   The outlay: $70 million to operate the venues.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't fall from the sky," Dryer said. "As a result of a lot
of good work and planning by SLOC management and through the
generosity of the IOC, it's enough to ensure the financial future of
the park and the oval."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation, however, faces an economic dilemma. The two venues
are projected to cost $4 million more to operate next year than the
$3 million both are expected to generate from site rentals and other
user fees.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to ask the state for more money, and we have
adopted a policy not to raid the (fund principal)," Dryer said.</TE>
<TE>   The only choices, he said, are to raise money through corporate
sponsorships, find additional revenues or rely on interest earned by
the endowment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, officials are considering a USOC request to extend the
foundation's umbrella to include Soldier Hollow, the bucolic venue
where Olympic biathlon and cross-country skiing races were staged.</TE>
<TE>   "Soldier Hollow is a very important venue in terms of developing
winter sports," Dryer said. "We need to find a way to make sure it is
sustainable. How is uncertain right now."</TE>
<TE>   The park and oval each costs about $3.5 million a year to operate.
Dryer doesn't know if the foundation can take on the extra $680,000
needed annually for Soldier Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   "Operations don't begin until winter," Dryer said. "We still have
time to address this issue."</TE>

consecutive tournaments</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods grew up in California and has grown rich in Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   He has won the last six tournaments he has played in the state,
including three consecutive Memorial tournaments and three
consecutive World Golf Championships at Firestone.</LD>
<LD>   How dominant is Woods in the Buckeye State? When he won the NEC
Invitational last August, he had twice as many victories in Ohio as
the Cleveland Browns since their return to the NFL.</LD>
<TE>   He has earned nearly $5 million within the boundaries of the
state, $1 million more than Arnold Palmer and Gary Player won in
their careers--combined.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 tournaments Woods has played as a professional in Ohio,
his average paycheck has been $496,385. He has made $124,000 for
every round he has played, $1,839 for every stroke at Muirfield
Village and Firestone.</TE>
<TE>   Next up is the Memorial at Muirfield Village Golf Club, where
Woods will try to become the first player to win the same tournament
in four consecutive years since Walter Hagen won the PGA Championship
from 1924-27.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Sarazen is the only other player to win the same tournament
four times in a row, the Miami Open in 1926 and from 1928-30.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be nice, to be able to put myself in elite company
like that," Woods said. "Those are obviously two of the biggest names
that have ever played the game, and hopefully I can do the same."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, Woods was 16 when he made the cut and advanced to
the second round of the U.S. Amateur at Muirfield before losing in
match play.</TE>
<TE>   He returned with his Stanford teammates for the 1995 NCAA
Championships at Ohio State's Scarlet Course. Woods tied for fifth in
the medalist race, with Stanford losing the team title in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   He made the cut and had two top-10 finishes in his first four pro
events in Ohio. Since then, he has been unbeatable.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, I've played well. I can't explain why, because
previously before that, I didn't really play very good here," Woods
said after his most recent victory in the state, the NEC Invitational
at Firestone Country Club in Akron. "And then all of a sudden it just
turned around."</TE>
<TE>   Woods' tournament wins have come in all varieties. He defended his
title in the 2000 NEC by 11 shots, then last year won the same event
in a seven-hole playoff with Jim Furyk.</TE>
<TE>   His Memorial wins, piled up on the Muirfield Village course
designed and built by his boyhood idol, Jack Nicklaus, have come by
two, five and seven shots.</TE>
<TE>   After Woods won last year's tournament in a runaway, Paul Azinger,
who tied for second, actually apologized to him.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has won from in front and come from behind. No matter the
situation through 18 holes, two rounds or with nine holes to play, it
is always Woods who ends up in the winner's circle.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I've been playing the sport, I've never found anybody
that's dominated anything more," Nicklaus said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's not such a coincidence that Woods has strung together
so many wins in the state, since both Muirfield and Firestone seem to
fit his game. Then again, with 31 wins in his five years on the PGA
Tour, a lot of courses seem to fit that description.</TE>
<TE>   Both courses are old-school layouts. Both are exceedingly long--in
excess of 7,100 yards--but have relatively wide, forgiving landing
areas and large greens.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Woods grew up in Southern California, he enjoys the
weather in the Midwest. He encounters heavy rains at Muirfield every
year and has battled everything from cold winds and driving rain to
high-humidity days in the 90s during his march through Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   It took two years on each course for Woods to discover how best to
attack Muirfield and Firestone.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you've won on the golf course and you go back, you're
always going to feel a little bit more comfortable," Woods said.
"That's a very warming feeling, especially coming down the stretch in
the tournament."</TE>
<TE>   He calls Muirfield one of his favorite places to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always loved the layout," he said. "I've always felt that it
suited my game. I didn't show that early, but I've learned how to
play the golf course."</TE>
<TE>   That same comfort zone applies at Firestone, although Woods will
have to go for his fourth consecutive NEC Invitational victory on a
new track. It is moving for one year to Sahalee Country Club outside
Seattle, where Woods tied for 10th in the '98 PGA Championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to miss not going to Firestone," Woods said. "I've
always loved that golf course because it's so simple. It's
straightforward. All the trouble is right in front of you, and the
golf course just says, 'Come get me if you can.'</TE>
<TE>   "You don't find that a lot in modern courses. They try to trick
things up."</TE>
<TE>   There have been no tricks about his play in Ohio. For the last
three years, Woods has shown up, defeated world-class fields and
walked away with a trophy and a large check.</TE>

<HD>Can He Leave This Behind?</HD>
<DH>The name is misleading: Hype Williams really did
revolutionize rap videos. But with his film career, he seems to be
missing a beat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Physics don't apply, or at least not any physics from around here.
People float, dance on walls, and have this habit of skittering back
and forth through time like errant record needles. Everything looks
distorted too, in a fish-eyed, funhouse way, and colors jump at your
eye like spray-painted zoo animals. The music never stops playing,
and, always, always, always the women are really hot.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the head of Harold Williams--dare you to change the
channel. The man they call Hype is the Fellini of ghetto fabulous,
the music video director who defined the modern visuals of hip-hop
and, in doing so, became the most famous rap star who doesn't rap.</LD>
<LD>   He has worked with everybody who is anybody and typically made
their most famous video. And while the list is rap-heavy, it veers
across the pop landscape: 2Pac, Jay-Z, the Notorious B.I.G., Janet
Jackson, Busta Rhymes, TLC, Missy Elliott, Nas, R. Kelly, Will Smith,
No Doubt, Babyface, Shelby Lynne, Nelly Furtado, and on and on.</LD>
<TE>   "Hype is certainly the watermark for all other video directors,"
says Tom Calderone, MTV's senior vice president of music and talent.
"He took the rap video form and made it into art. Most of the rap
videos are pretty much guys on the street and a couple of cameras. He
brought it to a whole new level. He made the hip-hop stars into video
stars, and made hip-hop and rap a bigger part of pop culture by
getting it in front of a lot more people."</TE>
<TE>   An accomplishment made more interesting by the fact that Williams
wants to walk away from all of it. He is chasing a desperate desire
to direct pieces that show in actual movie theaters, not just on MTV.
So far, his Hollywood trip has been a bumpy ride, his lone film, the
urban crime tale "Belly," leaving a bad taste in his mouth. "I don't
even like to talk about it," he says with a deep sigh, "but I learned
a lot, so that's a positive."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, described as a short-fuse perfectionist on the set, had
an especially difficult, frustrating shoot and then was wounded by
controversy over the film's violence. There were more than a few
gut-punch reviews too, criticizing the acting skills of the actors,
many of them rappers trying a new gig.</TE>
<TE>   Now Williams is working on a sophomore effort, but it's still a
year off and most every day the cell phone rings with another plea
from old friends: Hype, come home, make more music videos. But
Williams shakes his head. He's already done enough to fill up that
small screen.</TE>
<TE>   "No other music video director is solely responsible for a genre,"
he says with the casual certainty of someone glancing at his watch
and telling you the time of day. "All of rap video at one point came
just from how I saw it. I had a part in rap becoming a part of global
culture, and what more could I ask for?"</TE>
<TE>   Just because they call him Hype, don't doubt for a moment that he
is exactly right.</TE>
<TE>   With singular video images--take Sean "P. Diddy" Combs and Mase
launched into space, 2Pac and Dr. Dre playing Mad Max beyond
funk-dome, Missy Elliot in that inflatable rubber suit or dozens of
others--Williams achieved an unheard-of name recognition with fans.
Like Alfred Hitchcock among thriller film directors, Williams was the
creator who broke from the faceless ranks to become a brand with
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, MTV and TV Guide tallied the best music videos
ever and Williams finished with four in the top 25. The Source
magazine routinely puts Williams in its ranking of hip-hop power
players, one year as high as No. 4, putting him ahead of many of the
platinum-selling superstars in his videos. Williams even took to
flashing "Hype Williams Presents" across the screen at the start of
his videos, a peacock credit no other director has gotten away with
on MTV or any other major video outlet. This month, he breaks more
new ground with "Hype Williams: The Videos," the first of a DVD
series surveying his career. This release has 10 of his mini-movies,
including "No Scrubs" by TLC, "Big Pimpin'" by Jay-Z and "Can It All
Be So Simple" by the Wu-Tang Clan. Williams is certainly not the only
celebrated video director. David Fincher, Spike Jonze, Paul Hunter
and Dave Myers are notable and noticed, but as the less-than-humble
Williams points out, they don't have DVDs of their videos coming out.</TE>
<TE>   "Spike Jonze is not responsible for a genre," Williams says as he
plops back on an overstuffed couch in his Beverly Hills office. "And
I might be the only one in my genre that has a real identity. People
identify my body of work as an experience. Not everybody that has
done a load of videos can have a DVD that is worth someone actually
buying. I don't know why. It just so happens that my name has that
ability."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, Williams says all this and seems assured, not simply
arrogant.</TE>
<TE>   His friends and co-creators describe the 32-year-old as affable
but focused. The "Hype," by the way, came from childhood, not
Hollywood. Growing up in Queens in New York, Harold Williams was the
kind of kid who couldn't sit still unless he was perched in front of
the TV or a new stack of comic books. His nickname was short for
"hyperactive."</TE>
<TE>   Flipping through the channels, young Williams was mesmerized by
films (the camera shots and isolation themes in R. Kelly's "Half on a
Baby" video were a Williams shout-out to "Citizen Kane"), and loved
the energy of the new music video age. He wondered, though, why the
music he loved, hip-hop, was either absent or presented in an
amateurish way compared to pop and rock videos.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the guy that was sitting around watching the TV and fell in
love with it like the rest of the generation, but the difference was
I come from the street," Williams says.</TE>
<TE>   "The music that I loved wasn't represented on early MTV and VH1.
It wasn't well respected," he continues. "I loved it so much I wanted
to see the artists and music that I loved have imagery as impactful
as David Bowie or Madonna or Billy Idol."</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop was the home team for Williams. In Hollis, Queens, he went
to the same Catholic school that counted members of Run-DMC and LL
Cool J as alumni. The sidewalks were alive with the sound that was on
a path from neighborhood corners to pop world center stage.</TE>
<TE>   Rap joined Williams' passions for film and comic books. He watched
"The Godfather" over and over, and studied the frenetic panels of
"The Dark Knight Returns."</TE>
<TE>   He flirted with the idea of becoming a painter, but the energy of
film was too strong a tonic to resist. Williams learned the ropes by
toiling as a gofer on sets and soaking in the scene around him. His
big break came when Lyor Cohen of Def Jam Recordings gave the
20-year-old a chance to direct a video, which Williams now recalls as
"a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   As a director, Williams is famous for his devotion to the
wide-angle lens. The fish-eyed images in his videos with the
cartoonish Busta Rhymes, for example, seem to give the viewer a
peephole into a surreal world. He also shoots up, the camera low to
the ground. "The stars are giants to me," Williams says, "so I want
them to look like giants."</TE>
<TE>   Bold lighting and splashy special effects give Williams' videos
their polish, but their most innovative (and widely copied) trademark
might be the way every image is beholden to the beat and texture of
the music--everything on the screen will seize up, slow down, speed
up or reverse in sync with the music, creating a, well, hyperreality.
Williams' music videos may be famous for glitzy trappings and big
budgets, but their true power and glory is the visual breakbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days of rap video, the people that were responsible
for the production weren't from the genre. The people making the
imagery were filmmakers and artists and directors who didn't have
investment in the culture," he says. "That doesn't mean there wasn't
any creativity or good things--it just wasn't communicative of the
culture.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I came in. I was the one kid that was from that
generation and that culture that could make a statement much like one
of the artists. In a sense I was a rap artist."</TE>
<TE>   But what made Williams a star in videos makes him a question mark
in film. When people say a movie has an "MTV generation sensibility,"
they often don't mean it as a compliment.</TE>
<TE>   "Belly," his 1998 debut film, was dismissed by some as eye candy
without the nutrition of good storytelling. The film starred DMX, Nas
and Method Man. With Williams writing, directing, co-producing and
editing, it seemed like a hip-hop dream team. The story was billed as
a gritty morality tale, a "Mean Streets" for the hip-hop generation,
but gained more notoriety from the refusal of the Magic Johnson
Theatres chain to show it because of the "overwhelmingly negative and
violent depiction of African Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Now Williams says that if he was flipping through channels and saw
"Belly," he would keep going. "A political operation," he says.
"Making a film is like painting a portrait with 50 or 60 people
holding the brush for you, and you can't communicate those strokes."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is now going in a decidedly different direction for a
follow-up: "Speed Racer," Warner Bros.' live-action revival of the
1960s animated Japanese TV series about a young hero with a
gadget-laden race car and a family mystery to sort out. Film "is
everything, a way to create images that last lifetimes," Williams
says, but he does seem wistful recounting his favorite music video
exploits.</TE>
<TE>   The most decadent memory was the seafaring shoot for "Big
Pimpin'," filmed aboard a stunning yacht in Trinidad. "I've never had
such a good time. I don't think I'll ever have that good a time
again, either."</TE>
<TE>   Other videos reached the public with unintended subtexts because
of real-life circumstances. Williams was filming "Rock the Boat" with
R&amp;B singer Aaliyah just before her death in a plane crash in the
Bahamas last year, and now the video's island setting has an
unsettling grimness to it. Williams has far sunnier memories about
other videos. He recalled, for instance, awaiting 2Pac's helicopter
on location in the barren desert near El Mirage for "California
Love." The 1996 video with a post-apocalyptic theme captured a
performance by 2Pac and Dr. Dre at a special time in rap.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy to get a bunch of guys like that into furry
costumes and to spend four days in the middle of the desert, you know
what I'm saying?" Williams says. "But they trusted me enough to
communicate things that were far-fetched but yet still very pure and
connected to street level. Death Row Records was famous then for all
this crazy insanity, but the music and creativity was amazing too."</TE>
<TE>   If that was a high point, the location of today's music video
scene is harder to pinpoint. Costs continue to rise, with some of the
big stars spending $2 million to $3 million on the short films, which
are not guaranteed any lasting life on video channels.</TE>
<TE>   MTV, the most coveted forum, plays relatively few videos, and
record executives fume that they are throwing promotional resources
at videos that often become vanity projects for big-name artists who
demand top directors and increasingly expensive special effects.</TE>
<TE>   "The movies kind of dictate the direction that videos go in," says
Kedar Massenburg, president and CEO of Motown Records. "Now that you
have 'Spider-Man,' there's not too far you can go. With the
technology, these get very, very expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Massenburg, whose company has used videos to fashion the careers
of artists such as Erykah Badu and India.Arie, says he expects more
story lines to be used in videos. But to him and others, the artistry
has sagged. "The directors copy each other," Massenburg says. "And
they copy a lot from Hype."</TE>
<TE>   Williams keeps tabs on the new generation of video makers, and
what he sees leaves him dejected even as he ambles off to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I see its decline. It's not done with same amount of emotional
and artistic content," he says. "When I started, it was nowhere. What
I was able to do with these amazing, talented artists and record
labels was to take rap videos and make it important enough that
people even know who I am, not just the artist. From there, it's gone
nowhere and I resent that fact as someone who loves the music. I
don't know. Maybe I'm just getting older."</TE>

<LD>How fortunate for Robert Hilburn to have spent hundreds of hours with
Richard Melville Hall (Moby) during his promotional stint for "18"
("What Do You See, Moby?" May 12).</LD>
<LD>   I am originally from Hawthorne (home of the Beach Boys, in case
you didn't know). I owned a music studio in Gardena last year. Local
South Bay punk bands would perform on the weekends. I had to let that
business venture go due to certain legalities.</LD>
<LD>   In desperate pursuit of work, I recently moved out to Palm Springs
as a waiter, and I am now working as a marketing director at an art
gallery in nearby Palm Desert.</LD>
<TE>   I was very much inspired by your documentation of Moby's
music-making ethic: "When fans ask how to succeed as a musician, my
answer is harsh. I tell them not to do anything else."</TE>
<TE>   I realize that this is exactly what I must do--daily.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Neal McCabe makes the statement that "Sondheim is a great American
composer, but he drove off the road with 'Merrily We Roll Along'"
(Letters, May 12). However, the only reason he gives for "Merrily"
not working is the backward story line, which is difficult to blame
on Stephen Sondheim, as he did not write the book for the musical in
question.</LD>
<LD>   Sondheim wrote a brilliant score for "Merrily," one that will live
alongside his other scores in the best canon of work created in our
lifetimes. Perhaps the book failed, perhaps the original staging was
weak.</LD>
<LD>   Sondheim does tend to get all the credit when his shows work, so
perhaps it is understandable that he gets blamed when they do not.</LD>
<TE>   But more attention should be paid to what aspects of a show like
"Merrily" work and what do not before sweeping statements are made
placing blame.</TE>

<LD>As boring as last Sunday evening's "L.A. Law: The Movie" was, it was
immensely more entertaining than any of the three Yes concerts I
attended in the '70s--what a snore.</LD>
<LD>   It's no wonder an extremely talented musician like Rick Wakeman
left the band early on. He must have run out of money or something to
now rejoin these guys (Letters, April 28, May 5, May 12).</LD>
<LD>   Hey guys, ever heard of the words "stage presence" or
"showmanship"?</LD>
<TE>   I guess you never saw early Bowie or early Who, or even any show
by the Clash, the Pretenders, the Boss or U2.</TE>
<TE>   Ever wonder why the talented Trevor Horn and Trevor Rabin also
made quick departures?</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest band ever"? Not even in the top 100, considering
lesser-known but more talented bands like Big Star, the Replacements,
the Plimsouls, Midnight Oil and X, but Yes? No thank you.</TE>
<TE>   If I ever hear "I've Seen All Good People" again, I'm throwing my
radio out the window.</TE>

<HD>Arclight Dims at the Dome</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have swallowed--hook, line and sinker--the idea of Arclight
Cinemas. I bought into the $14 tickets. I joined the membership club
even before I set foot into the theater.</LD>
<LD>   I first went to Arclight to see "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," and I
loved every minute of the experience: the sound, the seats, the lack
of advertisements, the picture. Going to the movies is a redefined
experience.</LD>
<LD>   Then comes the first blockbuster of the summer, "Spider-Man." I
cannot wait to see this at Arclight, and this time I want to see it
at the Dome--the refurbished Cinerama Dome.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Arclight Web site, it has even more added
features than the multiplex auditoriums. I sold my friends on the
idea of $14 tickets by reciting news articles and the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   I loved telling them that the theaters "exceed THX standards" with
their state-of-the-art "Kinoton projectors, JBL speakers and Dolby
and SDDS sound systems." Some of them asked me if I was a spokesman
for Arclight.</TE>
<TE>   I bought the tickets online; a bunch of tickets had already been
sold, so I had to take seats in the back of the theater, Row Z.</TE>
<TE>   Everything I had bought into, and therefore sold my friends on as
well, was false for Row Z.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that the moviegoing experience described doesn't fully
apply to the last five or so rows in the Cinerama Dome. Imagine the
dome and a circle's perimeter. The last couple of rows are outside
this perimeter, underneath the projection booth. This makes most of
the features of the Arclight movie experience moot.</TE>
<TE>   All of the speakers (and even the projectors) are way in front of
you. I could hear the people around me eating their caramel popcorn
and the girls talking about Tobey Maguire's abs better than I could
hear the film.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a little more sensory overload. Imagine this space (outside
the perimeter) with a short ceiling and walls on three sides, jammed
with five rows of people. The warmth of body heat was unbearable for
the first hour, not to mention the combination of popcorn, chocolate,
hot-dog and other less pleasant smells.</TE>
<TE>   I have had better theater experiences at the Bose store in the
mall--and those were free.</TE>

<LD>Regarding T.C. Shannon's misguided attempt to promote the actor he
represents by stating that all the actors you profiled May 5 in "The
Unusual Suspects" are not beautiful or handsome, he does a great
disservice to both his client and all the actors you profiled
(Letters, May 12).</LD>
<LD>   Shannon asserts that the actors in the article only get their
roles because a more attractive actor would detract from the stars,
ignoring the fact that all these actors receive rave reviews and are
often singled out as being the best thing in the projects they do.</LD>
<LD>   These actors each bring something that makes the picture and the
actors around them better.</LD>
<TE>   They have the ability to play characters from all walks of life
and of various nationalities, and to make the characters real and
vibrant.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the actors are ethnic actors and have played numerous
nationalities, something not every actor in Hollywood can pull off.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Shannon, if your actor can play a Lebanese FBI agent and speak
Arabic in the movie, an Italian chef and do half the script in
Italian, and then turn around and play Tech Sgt. Chen, then you have
a beef.</TE>
<TE>   If he can't, then maybe you owe the profiled actors an apology.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The saxophone may well be the quintessential jazz instrument.
Unrestricted by the sort of classically oriented stylistic
predecessors that exist for the trumpet, the trombone and most other
jazz instruments, it can be whatever a player wants it to be.</LD>
<LD>   Even a cursory glance at the major stylists--alto saxophonists
from Johnny Hodges to Charlie Parker, tenor players from Coleman
Hawkins and Lester Young to Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane--reveals
the range of voices in which the instrument is capable of speaking.</LD>
<LD>   The breadth and scope of that range is particularly apparent this
week with the arrival of new albums from Wayne Shorter, Joe Lovano,
John Surman and Jane Bunnett (with Dewey Redman), five of the most
diverse saxophone stylists on the contemporary jazz scene.</LD>
<TE>   Wayne Shorter, "Footprints Live!" (****, Verve Records). Shorter
has been touring with an extraordinary group--perhaps the most
invigorating creative environment he has experienced since his days
with Weather Report and, before that, the Miles Davis Quintet. What
makes this ensemble even more exciting is that, with a few
exceptions, this represents Shorter's first major group effort in an
acoustic setting in decades.</TE>
<TE>   The material is all familiar, dating to prior recordings (among
the highlights: "Masquelero," "Footprints," "JuJu" and "Valse
Triste"), but rendered here in stunning new settings.</TE>
<TE>   Shorter, whose playing has had an erratic quality in the six years
since his wife died in the crash of TWA Flight 800 off New York, has
been demonstrably vitalized by the ensemble of pianist Danilo Perez,
bassist John Patitucci and drummer Brian Blade.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, there is the sense of a vivid imagination at work,
using the horn in the same sort of stop-and-start, ever-exploratory
manner that characterizes Shorter's verbal conversations. Once again,
there is the quality of on-the-spot, spontaneous compositional
invention every time Shorter's saxophone dips in and out of the
ensemble passages.</TE>
<TE>   "Ensemble passages" are the key words for this marvelous album,
which rewards repeated listening with more and more musical insights.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every moment is filled with inventive interaction; solos
surface from time to time but never in isolation, never in the more
typical fashion of an individual performing in the spotlight with
accompaniment taking place in the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when new directions are certainly hard to come by in the
jazz world, Shorter has offered a defining example of collective jazz
making, of an approach to improvisation that offers a rewarding
creative pathway into the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Lovano, "Viva Caruso" (**1/2, Blue Note). No one has ever
really explained why there have been so many fine Italian jazz tenor
saxophonists, with Lovano one of the very best. Whatever the answer,
he makes a direct link between those other Italian tenors--the
singers--with one particularly legendary voice in mind, that of
Enrico Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the tribute, Lovano has elected to include only one of the
arias from Caruso's many operatic appearances--the "Vesti la Giubba"
from "I Pagliacci."</TE>
<TE>   The balance of the Caruso-related pieces consists of songs he
recorded--among them, the familiar "O Sole Mio" and "Santa Lucia" and
the lesser-known "For You Alone" (one of the few songs that the great
tenor recorded in English).</TE>
<TE>   The decision to de-emphasize arias was undoubtedly motivated by
the difficulties of finding ways to make them harmonically viable for
jazz variations--a much easier task with simple song form.</TE>
<TE>   Lovano performs in a variety of settings, including accompaniments
by the Opera Ensemble (largely consisting of woodwinds and the voice
of his wife, singer Judi Silvano), the Street Band (a collection of
brass and percussion), as well as several smaller groupings.</TE>
<TE>   The results of all this intense thematic planning are distinctly
uneven. Lovano's burly sound and intrepid sense of swing make
everything he plays an intriguing experience; he can't, however,
quite manage to carry the whole album on his own.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that the material and the settings are less
pleasing than Lovano's soloing, varying so widely in style that the
album lacks a center--a problem exacerbated by the too busy qualities
of the large group accompaniments. As it turns out, despite the
Caruso label, the most interesting piece on the album is a Lovano
original--"Il Carnivale Di Pulcinella," which, despite its occasional
missteps, adds some much needed emotional spice to the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   John Surman and Jack DeJohnette, "Live in Tampere and Berlin"
(***, ECM Records). English saxophonist Surman and American drummer
DeJohnette have created a remarkable contemporary jazz document that
incorporates a wide collection of synthesizers and technological
gadgets.</TE>
<TE>   Surman has had a long tenure in the jazz avant-garde. Reaching
back to the late '60s, he has been one of the most prominent voices
in the sort of envelope-stretching jazz making that continued to play
an important role in the European scene long after American artists
had begun to revisit the bebop '40s and '50s.</TE>
<TE>   DeJohnette has been similarly adventurous, moving easily from his
improvisatory excursions to performances with the Keith Jarrett
standards trio.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the final track, "Song for World Forgiveness," which
features its composer, DeJohnette, on piano, the music is improvised.
But there is little that sounds random about the performances, which
often are held together by spontaneous ostinato passages, and which
have the quality of carefully thought out musical assemblages.</TE>
<TE>   And there is plenty of straight-ahead blowing for the mainstream
music fan as well, with both Surman and DeJohnette swinging with
amazing synchronicity.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Shorter album, this effort is the product of the
interaction of gifted musical minds, coming together in a fashion
that retains the individual improvisatory qualities of jazz while
remaining open to the border stretching qualities of communal music
making--a clear example of one plus one equaling considerably more
than two.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Bunnett, Dewey Redman, Stanley Cowell and others, "Spirituals
and Dedications" (***1/2, Justin Time). Canadian saxophonist Bunnett
describes this splendid album in the liner notes as "a cooperative
effort with input from all participants."</TE>
<TE>   That seems to be exactly what has happened in a series of tracks
aimed at honoring the spirituals and spiritual music that have played
such an important role in jazz.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to traditional songs--"Shadrack," "Sometimes I Feel
Like a Motherless Child," "I'm Gonna Tell God," etc. (sung with great
intensity by Dean Bowman)--the album includes several similarly
oriented originals. Bunnett's "Don's Light" is dedicated to the late
pianist Don Pullen; "A Laugh for Rory" is a Rahsaan Roland Kirk
composition; "Ecclusiastics" is Charles Mingus' gospel-drenched
swinger; and "Powerful Paul Robeson" is a Clifford Jordan tribute to
the noted African American actor-singer.</TE>
<TE>   The CD's lengthiest track is Cowell's "Illusion Suite," with the
veteran avant-gardist Redman surging through a driving set of
choruses and Cowell displaying his too rarely heard capacity to
generate musical excitement.</TE>
<TE>   Bunnett, moving as usual from soprano saxophone to flute, affirms
her remarkable versatility. As comfortable with the complexities of
Afro-Cuban rhythms as she is with jazz, she plays with the sort of
singing tone and melodic inventiveness that have characterized all
the great saxophonists.</TE>

<HD>He Wants to Know Why They Go to Bat</HD>
<DH>Sports: A college student turns his love of the game into a
research project that will examine youth baseball in Asia and Latin
America.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>GRINNELL, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Michael Abel's baseball odyssey began 12 years ago when he watched a
Taiwanese team celebrate its Little League World Series title with
stunning modesty--a simple tip of the cap and bow to fans.</LD>
<LD>   For a then 11-year-old baseball fanatic, the unified and subdued
gesture resonated, especially when he compared it to the jubilant
"pig pile" of the U.S. winners the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   "It just struck me at the time that obviously these kids came with
a different set of priorities and values," Abel said of the team that
beat Shippensburg, Pa., 9-0 in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   Today, as a 23-year-old Grinnell College senior, Abel is about to
embark on a yearlong adventure to Japan, southeast Asia and Latin
America to take a closer look at foreign cultures through the lens of
youth baseball.</TE>
<TE>   For his post-graduate project, he will watch youth baseball games
and observe how cultural differences are reflected in the way the
game is taught, played and fits into the local and national fabric.</TE>
<TE>   Abel said he also hopes to find that baseball in Osaka, Japan, or
Maracaibo, Venezuela, for example, is popular for more reasons than
its ties to American culture.</TE>
<TE>   "I really want to get a sense for what baseball means to these
people," said Abel, who will graduate in June with a political
science major and a minor in Chinese studies.</TE>
<TE>   "There is the perception that this is solely America's game. I'm
going on the assumption that that's really not the case. My guess is
that baseball will be so ingrained that the cultural differences will
be evident in the way the game is played and taught," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the former Seattle Mariners batboy was named one of 60
Thomas J. Watson fellows for 2002. The program, started in 1968 by
the children of IBM Corp. founder Thomas J. Watson, provides students
from 50 small, liberal arts colleges with $22,000 for a year of
travel and study abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Abel acknowledges that his research lacks the punch of, say,
researching a cure for cancer or improving Third World economies. But
his proposal embodied the clever, passionate and novel ideas that
Watson fellowship judges find so appealing, said Norvell Brasch,
executive director of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, we're looking for the quintessential ability to capture
the unique aspect of a culture through a distinctive lens, and he got
it with his proposal," Brasch said.</TE>
<TE>   Abel said his childhood in Seattle resembled that of any baseball
junkie: countless summer hours scooping grounders off the
neighborhood diamond, poring over box scores and watching the Little
League World Series, a tournament involving teams from across the
globe held annually in Williamsport, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   "My feelings for baseball bordered on obsession," said Abel, who
transferred to the liberal arts college, in part, for a chance to
play second base for the Pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   But Abel said the fellowship also symbolizes the merger of his
other interests. He said he is fascinated with foreign culture. He
has applied for a position with the Foreign Service and is also
considering graduate studies in foreign affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Abel's itinerary first takes him to Japan. Then it's on to Taiwan,
whose 17 Little League World Series championships are the most of any
country.</TE>
<TE>   He also plans to visit Mexico, Venezuela and Curacao--countries
with rich baseball traditions.</TE>

<HD>Prospects Sweet for Budding Pastry Chefs</HD>
<DH>Food: America's love affair with desserts has raised the
status of the profession. Cooking schools are filled with new
students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA LIQUORI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HYDE PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Americans' never-ending love of cakes, pies and anything else sweet
has created a huge demand in one profession: pastry chefs.</LD>
<LD>   At the Culinary Institute of America, one of the nation's most
prestigious cooking schools, chefs who can turn out exquisite
desserts and baked goods have become so sought-after that the
institute is doubling the number of entry dates for students
interested in making bread and pastry.</LD>
<LD>   "For years, our profession has been in the background. In the
middle of the night, the poor baker is in the cellar, baking," said
chef Victor A.L. Gielisse, the associate vice president and dean of
culinary baking and pastry studies at the institute, on the Hudson
River about 75 miles north of New York City.</LD>
<TE>   That's all changed now that mainstream diners are becoming more
sophisticated. The ubiquity of Martha Stewart and food shows on
television has raised diners' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "The American public is highly educated about food today," chef
George Higgins said as he showed students how to cut pink marzipan
hearts to decorate cakes. "It's a good time for us, for many culinary
programs."</TE>
<TE>   It's not about gorging on mass-produced doughnuts. "It's always
the crowning piece for the meal," Gielisse said of dessert.</TE>
<TE>   Chef En-Ming Hsu, the first graduate of the baking program in
1992, is now the award-winning pastry chef for the Four Seasons in
Chicago. She supervises 10 people and oversees all baking for the
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a madhouse. We're busy," she said. The institute's baking
program gave her training in the fundamentals, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she fields numerous calls from businesses looking for
pastry chefs. "There are a lot of hotels ... looking for a lot of
pastry chefs."</TE>
<TE>   "People are more aware of what pastry chefs can do," she said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data illustrate the demand for
chefs who bake: A 16% growth in retail bakeries, a 12% growth in
baking manufacturing and a 32% growth in hotels and lodging by 2008
is expected.</TE>
<TE>   The culinary institute has about 2,100 students. Of those, 300
specialize in the baking arts. The school runs throughout the year,
allowing students pursuing a bachelor's degree to finish in 38
months. An associate's degree takes 21 months.</TE>
<TE>   Tuition ranges from $11,000 to $16,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The interest in baked goods marks a new appreciation for the
specialty, but consumers aren't necessarily demanding fancy
concoctions. They're looking for comfort food with excellent
ingredients, said chef Thomas Gumpel, an associate dean for baking
and pastry arts at the school.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer is starting to see dessert is part of the meal," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said making pastries appeals to his creative side and that
he enjoys working with his hands. "It just suited me perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   And chef Daniel Budd, holding a pan of passion fruit jelly for a
class on pectin, put it this way: "I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
I get to go to work and make candy."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the graduates don't have trouble finding a job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an industry that's clamoring for people," said Ray Wells,
the director of career services at the school, which has a 96%
placement rate. Starting salaries as a pastry chef can range from
$18,000 to $30,000. An experienced pastry chef can make more than
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The school has placed chefs--including pastry chefs--in some of
the finest restaurants in the country, such as the Ritz Carlton
hotels, Equinox in Manchester, Vt., and the Park Avenue Cafe in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   And the author of the "Death by Chocolate" cookbooks, Marcel
Desaulniers, graduated from the school before there was a specific
pastry and baking program.</TE>
<TE>   Student Michelle Hoekstra of Buffalo, Minn., said she loves
working with the ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   "I like getting my hands into bread, and I think gluten is really
cool," said Hoekstra, trying a recipe for pound cake using peanut
butter as the fat component. She said she wants to travel the world
and taste everything she can before settling down and becoming a
pastry chef, perhaps opening her own restaurant someday.</TE>
<TE>   The desserts and breads created by the novice bakers at the school
are delectable and rich. The goodies are sold in the public cafe and
bakery on the campus.</TE>
<TE>   They are also served in the school's restaurants, and as lunchtime
draws near, classes take on the real-life aura of a frantic
restaurant kitchen before mealtime.</TE>
<TE>   "You're providing comfort. You're nurturing culture," Gielisse
said. "Sharing a meal with people is one of the best things in life."</TE>

<HD>American Expatriates Cling to Cuba's Socialist Ideals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAISLEY DODDS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>The wall of windows at Lorna Burdsall's seventh-floor apartment
overlooks a bay ringed by trash. The vintage red elevator, installed
before Fidel Castro seized power, is decrepit.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the American widow of "Red Beard"--the socialist
revolutionary who went on to become Cuba's top intelligence
chief--says her 47 years in the Caribbean country have given her few
complaints.</LD>
<LD>   "The heat is one of the few things that I haven't gotten used to
in Cuba," says Burdsall, 73, apologizing for not hearing the doorbell
at first because she had retreated to her air-conditioned bedroom.</LD>
<TE>   Burdsall, who moved to Cuba from New York in 1955, is one of more
than a dozen Americans who call this communist island home, still
clinging to the ideals of a socialist revolution as capitalism
expands its hold around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to be a good communist, but I don't think they
exist," the white-haired, fiery grandmother says. "Socialism,
however, is a good step toward that perfect society; it's an
interim."</TE>
<TE>   Her sentiment is rare in a time of fading allegiances to the left.
Since the collapse of communism and the rise of globalization,
leftists throughout the world have struggled to maintain unity and,
in the United States, that challenge has deepened since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The left has been limping along for decades, but whatever legs it
had were lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union," said Amitai
Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University who
specializes in American culture. "Leftists are looking for a place
for their beliefs and Cuba is one of the last hopes, a remnant of
communism."</TE>
<TE>   In Burdsall's sparse apartment on the outskirts of Havana, there
are no outward signs of her revolutionary life except for faded
photos of herself with the Cuban leader, Argentine revolutionary Che
Guevara and her husband, Manuel Pineiro, known as "Barbarroja" for
the thick red beard he grew while he was a guerrilla in the Sierra
Maestra.</TE>
<TE>   The Cuba that Burdsall now calls home is a world away from the
place she discovered after marrying Pineiro, whose older brothers
owned a distributing agency for Hatuey beer and Bacardi rum. He was
studying business administration at Columbia University when they
met.</TE>
<TE>   "He was dancing the most fabulous mambo," Burdsall recalls.</TE>
<TE>   After marrying him, Burdsall put her career as a dancer on hold to
follow her husband and his dream of starting a revolution in Cuba.
Shortly after their arrival, Pineiro was engrossed in the pro-Castro
underground working to overthrow the dictator Fulgencio Batista.</TE>
<TE>   "When we came, it was very dangerous," she says. "We moved around
a lot. The conditions were terrible. I remember ants in the soup and
staying in places where the rats would eat my high-heeled shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Burdsall became pregnant and, before long, was keeping weapons and
ammunition in her baby's room. The guns--like her husband--eventually
ended up in the Sierra Maestra, where Castro and his rebels were
training to overthrow Batista.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after their victory in 1959, Pineiro was named deputy
minister of the interior and went on to head Cuba's security and
intelligence operations. He later helped train leftist groups
throughout Latin America. "He was completely committed to the
revolution," Burdsall says.</TE>
<TE>   Burdsall resumed her career in dance, founding the Compania Danza
Contemporanea and becoming the national director of dance and modern
dance under the culture ministry.</TE>
<TE>   She traveled frequently to the United States and divorced Pineiro
after 20 years of marriage. He died four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Today, although still committed to her husband's dreams, Burdsall
openly criticizes Cuba. She says low wages and a dependency on U.S.
dollars have forced some doctors--who earn the equivalent of $20 a
month--to work as piano players to earn the coveted currency.</TE>
<TE>   But she believes that the good outweighs the bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that if Manuel were alive today, he would say that most
of the things they set out to accomplish in the revolution were
achieved, particularly in the areas of education, medicine and the
arts, but it's only logical that some would be disappointed with the
way some things turned out," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba convert Michael Fuller's journey to the communist nation in
1994 was motivated by politics, not love. He came as a member of the
"solidarity brigades," an international group dedicated to helping
Cubans that he joined while living in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about returning to Spain, but all things pointed to me
staying. My very presence was an act of solidarity," says Fuller, 37,
a native of Syracuse, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller, who lives on the outskirts of Havana and works as a writer
and teacher, says he's committed to Cuba's communist policies.</TE>
<TE>   "I eat great. I don't miss ownership, and I have come to accept
the philosophy," he says. "I suppose I could use a car, but I don't
miss the commercials on TV, and I've gained serenity here. I've also
gained a family and faith in the future."</TE>

<DH>Education: A ballroom dance class gives fourth-graders
confidence and teaches them a little about other cultures. And, to
them, it gets in some torture.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WEST CAPE MAY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Ten-year-old Nathan Langston puts his right foot forward, eyes down,
and makes his way across the floor like a man headed to the electric
chair.</LD>
<LD>   Ten-year-old Emily Whissell is waiting for him.</LD>
<LD>   It's time to waltz at West Cape May Elementary School, and Nathan
is in no rush to start.</LD>
<TE>   "C'mon guys, don't go over there mumbling, with fumbly hands,"
instructor Tom Cupp calls out. "Act like she's got your favorite
candy!"</TE>
<TE>   So, Nathan walks up to Emily and extends his right hand, his eyes
still focused squarely on the hardwood floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello, my name is Nathan. Would you like to have this dance?" he
asks. She nods. Then, their hands meet and he backs up, step by step,
until they get to their starting spot.</TE>
<TE>   Cupp hits the play button on a beat box perched on the lip of the
stage and Steve Tyrell's rendition of "It Had to Be You" starts to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Emily and Nathan waltz, keeping time ... 1-2-3 ... to the music
... 1-2-3 ... while Cupp shouts encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies, I want you to keep your hand in a nice, strong cup. Guys,
just let her revolve around until she comes back to you," he says.</TE>
<TE>   This is not easy.</TE>
<TE>   To the seven boys and three girls in Amy Stoner's fourth-grade
class, almost anything else would be preferable. Who ever heard of
ballroom dancing class in elementary school? And who would think it's
a good idea?</TE>
<TE>   Cupp and Principal William Donato do. The Alliance for Arts
Education-New Jersey provided an $800 mini-grant to have the former
ballroom dancing champion give eight weeks of instruction. The idea
not only is to teach cooperation and dance skills, but also to
broaden the children's perspective by teaching them about the
cultural origins of various dances.</TE>
<TE>   No one here expects Nathan and Emily to become Fred and Ginger.
But school officials believe their young dancers can make giant
steps--even if they don't learn any in particular.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a confidence builder, and it builds self-esteem too," Donato
said. "They learn they can do something. And as they realize they
have abilities they didn't know about, that will spill over into
other areas."</TE>
<TE>   It was a tough sell, to be sure.</TE>
<TE>   That much was evident the first week, when Cupp first told them to
hold hands.</TE>
<TE>   "One girl just couldn't do it," he said. "She looks at her partner
and goes, 'He has a wart on his hand! Ewww!' and they all fall down
laughing. So now, I bring Band-Aids. Just in case."</TE>
<TE>   Every Thursday at 9 a.m., the fourth-graders pile into the gym for
their 55-minute session, dressed casually in blue jeans, athletic
shoes and sweatshirts.</TE>
<TE>   Cupp, a former Haddonfield High School football player, knows the
subject matter like the back of his Cuban heels. He won two U.S.
Grand National Ballroom Dance titles in the early 1980s with partner
Darlene LaPreste and now runs Fine Life Presentations, a nonprofit
local theater company.</TE>
<TE>   But he keeps the class light, starting each session with a brief
refresher about the steps and information covered previously.</TE>
<TE>   The children, with spiral notebooks in hand, sit on the floor in a
semicircle.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the most important thing in ballroom dancing?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Be polite and nice!" they reply.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we talked about the foxtrot last week. What's the time
signature for the foxtrot?"</TE>
<TE>   "Four-four."</TE>
<TE>   "What does that mean?"</TE>
<TE>   "Four beats per measure."</TE>
<TE>   "Good. What's the rhythm?"</TE>
<TE>   "Slow, quick, quick. Slow, quick, quick."</TE>
<TE>   Cupp knows of no other school in New Jersey that offers ballroom
dance instruction. But he would like to see it take hold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for social skills, and it's a proactive introduction
to cultural diversity. It's teamwork, it's trust, it's kindness.
You're not out there trying to outdance your partner," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the children step out onto the floor, lining up along the
lane of the basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   With only three girls, physical education teacher Peg Arnold is
pressed into duty as a dancer. Even then, three boys get left out
each turn. They practice the moves by themselves while the other four
couples dance.</TE>
<TE>   When they are face to face, the young dancers look at their feet,
at their hands, at Cupp, at the student paintings hung on the walls,
at the basketball hoops--anywhere but at each other.</TE>
<TE>   Cupp is sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the session, he tries to cheer them up. "Don't
worry. Torture's almost over."</TE>
<TE>   When the session finally ends, they file back out and down the
hall. There's not much talk about the dancing once they get back in
class.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very quiet about it," Stoner said. "They go into the
girls' bathroom and the boys' bathroom afterwards and chat, and then
they're fine after that."</TE>

<LD>You don't have to be a super-athlete to significantly reduce your

<LD>   Blair and colleague Chong Do Lee of West Texas A&amp;M University
looked at data on 16,878 men ages 40 to 87 who had no history of
heart attack or stroke at the start of the study.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers gave the men treadmill tests and sorted them into
low-, medium- and high-fitness groups.</TE>
<TE>   The men in the highest fitness group had a 68% lower risk of
stroke death than the men who were in the lowest group, the study
found. But the men in the moderate group had almost as much
benefit--a 63% lower risk.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies have indicated that simply being active, doing
things like walking regularly, might reduce stroke risk. "I would
strongly recommend to those 50 million inactive adults to participate
in any kind of exercise to protect against stroke mortality," Lee
said.</TE>
<TE>   But this study documented a striking benefit from strenuous
activity that can produce fitness gains.</TE>
<TE>   To be moderately fit, a person would have to run regularly for 20
to 40 minutes, three to five times a week, Lee said. To be highly
fit, a person would have be at the recreationally competitive level,
Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are in line with previous research on the protection
that exercise gives against dying of a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Early studies on heart disease commonly focused on runners, and
led to the running boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Later research, including work done by Blair, found that it took
far less intense activity to get out of the highest risk group for
heart disease--those people who do no exercise.</TE>
<TE>   These studies led the surgeon general to recommend that people do
at least 30 minutes of moderate activity such as walking or gardening
a minimum of several days a week.</TE>
<TE>   The new findings on stroke are similar to those on heart disease
in that the biggest benefit comes from getting out of the lowest-fit
group, said researcher Barry Franklin of William Beaumont Hospital in
Royal Oak, Mich., who was not involved in the study.</TE>
<TE>   The study also indicates that the effort required to be a
super-athlete doesn't mean there is automatically much greater
protection against stroke death, compared to those with a moderate
level of fitness.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of finding is coming up with increasing frequency in
the last decade or more," said researcher Carl Foster of the
University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.</TE>

<HD>Isolated Outpost in Cuba</HD>
<DH>Military: Guantanamo Bay naval base resembles a small 1950s
American town and is an island within an island.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IAN JAMES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba</DL>
<LD>Most cigars sold here are Jamaican. Spanish is rarely spoken. Small
U.S. flags adorn the antennas of Chevrolet pickups. The music blaring
has a distinctly American beat.</LD>
<LD>   The Guantanamo Bay naval base is part of Cuba only geographically
speaking. Enclosed in 17 miles of fence guarded by U.S. Marines, it
is firmly isolated from the land beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Few people come or go under the sign that declares in Spanish,
"Republic of Cuba: Free Territory of America," and coils of rusted
concertina wire remain as a reminder of political differences that
have divided two nations for more than four decades.</LD>
<TE>   Few traces of Cuba remain on the base except for about 70 Cubans
who live here--a mix of longtime residents, their descendants, and
asylum-seekers who swam or crossed minefields to reach the U.S.
outpost.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know each other," said Gloria Martinez, a 69-year-old
widow who has lived on the base since 1961, when she and her husband
sought refuge after the triumph of Fidel Castro's communist
revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez has become a U.S. citizen and speaks English, but she
prefers Spanish and enjoys cooking Cuban dishes of pork, black beans
and rice for friends. "Here, I have a big family," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But for nearly all the 4,700 military personnel and civilians
here, free time means paintball tournaments, yoga classes and dancing
to hip-hop tunes at the recreation hall.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like I'm just in another place in America," said Lance
Cpl. Joshua Devore, a 21-year-old Marine from Rochester, N.Y., who
helps guard prisoners accused of having links to Afghanistan's fallen
Taliban regime or the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   The base has no stoplights, and some say it feels like a small
American town of the 1950s. The weekly newsletter announces a
military spouse apron sale and each day's school lunch, from fish
sticks to fruit gelatin.</TE>
<TE>   The base closed its gates to Cuba in 1961 after the failed
CIA-backed invasion by anti-Castro Cubans at the Bay of Pigs. The
only people allowed through nowadays are 10 elderly Cuban workers who
arrive at the gates by bus each morning--the last among thousands who
once commuted to jobs here. The youngest among them is 62.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the base is an island within an island, a sort of
modern-day Alcatraz, which like the now-closed prison off San
Francisco has become useful because of its isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld called it "the least worst
place we could have selected" for the captives from the Afghanistan
war.</TE>
<TE>   Radios on the base pick up Cuba's Radio Reloj on the AM dial, and
at night the lights of the nearby towns Caimanera and Boqueron cast
their glow from below the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. trade embargo prevents buying Cuban cigars or
anything else from the other side. It's also impossible to telephone
Cuba directly.</TE>
<TE>   Normal channels of communication were cut long ago. U.S. troops
seized the land in 1898 during the Spanish-American War, and since a
1903 agreement, the United States has leased it from Cuba for 2,000
gold coins a year, now valued at $4,085.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government still pays, but Castro's government opposes
the U.S. presence and refuses to cash the checks. Since 1964, when
Cuba cut the water supply, the base has drawn its water from a
desalination plant.</TE>
<TE>   With the end of the Cold War, tensions have eased. Along the
fence, Marines in guard towers watch Cuban guards in distant lookout
posts. Now and then, a thump from the explosion of an old Cuban
landmine breaks the silence, set off by a passing animal or perhaps
just age.</TE>
<TE>   Cubans from the nearby city of Guantanamo still occasionally swim
across the bay or hike to the base in hopes of taking refuge. But the
number of asylum-seekers has waned, and now most are sent back as
required by a 1995 migration agreement.</TE>
<TE>   A small number who can prove a fear of political persecution are
allowed to stay until U.S. officials find other countries to accept
them. Those 25 Cubans live in separate barracks, and some have
remained for years.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, the base held tens of thousands of Cuban and
Haitian boat people picked up by U.S. ships as they tried to get to
the U.S. mainland. Most of the Cubans were admitted into the United
States; most Haitians were sent home. The last of the Cubans departed
in 1996, leaving empty camps on the dry, cactus-dotted hills.</TE>
<TE>   Near a seaside cliff, one Cuban artist left a sculpture of a
woman, her gaze fixed in the distance--a silent reminder that this
place too is part of Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Once a month, U.S. and Cuban officers meet at the gates to discuss
security issues. Relations between their governments, though, remain
cool.</TE>
<TE>   "Someday maybe they'll open up the gates and let us down in
Guantanamo City," said Army 2nd Lt. Jason Miller of Bettendorf, Iowa.
"But not until the United States and Cuba mend fences."</TE>

<HD>Computer Model Explains Variations in Mars' Poles</HD>
<DH>Space: The northern hemisphere is made up mainly of frozen
water, while the south is high and dry. Shift in the Hadley effect is
cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM McCALL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The north and south poles on Mars look very different from each
other, and scientists now think they know why: Circulation patterns
in the Red Planet's very thin atmosphere tend to keep all the water
in the north, leaving the south pole high and dry.</LD>
<LD>   The exploration of Mars by unmanned spacecraft has shown that the
northern hemisphere has a large polar cap made up mostly of frozen
water while the southern hemisphere has a much smaller cap made up
almost entirely of frozen carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice.</LD>
<LD>   A new computer model suggests the apparently permanent difference
results partly from the much higher elevation in the south--which is
an average of three miles higher than the north.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Richardson of the California Institute of Technology and John
Wilson of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton
University reported in a recent issue of the journal Nature that the
difference in elevation shifts the Hadley effect, an atmospheric
circulation pattern created when heated air rises from the warmer
equator and sinks toward the poles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the dominant form of atmospheric circulation in the tropics
here on Earth," Richardson said, "where you get rising air in the
region most strongly heated by the sun that has to be replaced by
cooler air at the surface."</TE>
<TE>   On Earth, however, the circulation is balanced between the
northern and southern tropics, causing the gentle trade winds across
the relatively flat and even expanse of the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   On Mars, the Hadley effect reaches much farther toward the poles
across a dry and dusty surface.</TE>
<TE>   The huge difference in elevation between the north and south poles
also tends to push the thin Martian air more strongly from the high
elevations of the south toward the northern lowlands, Richardson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting imbalance dumps snow and ice at the north pole of
Mars and may be responsible for its alternating layers of ice and
dust, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "On Earth, we're used to thinking the southern summer is similar
to the northern summer," Richardson said, "but it's not that way on
Mars."</TE>
<TE>   Mars is tilted on its axis at about the same degree as Earth,
causing a change in seasons as it orbits the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Earth, however, Mars has a large variation in orbit that
puts it about 20% closer to the sun when it is summer in the south,
making the season much more intense than summer in the northern
hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   David Hinson of Stanford University, one of the leaders of the
latest NASA survey of Mars, said Martian weather will be the focus of
several unmanned space missions planned in the coming decade.</TE>
<TE>   He said the model developed by Richardson and Wilson makes useful
comparisons between actual measurements taken by the Mars Global
Surveyor spacecraft now orbiting the planet and computer simulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems quite plausible to me," Hinson said. "I think it's an
important step in understanding how climate change on Mars might be
occurring."</TE>

<HD>Pool Near Slum Is Rio's New Hot Spot</HD>
<DH>Recreation: The wildly popular o piscinao, dug out of a
beach in an impoverished area, is the answer to the fabled Ipanema to
the south.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER MUELLO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil</DL>
<LD>It's no accident, Rio people ruefully joke, that their city's famous
statue of Christ faces fabled Ipanema beach, with its back turned to
the slum-ridden north.</LD>
<LD>   Rio's South Zone and North Zone are worlds apart, and nowhere is
the divide more evident than on the golden sands of Ipanema, whose
hip and affluent regulars tend to regard the northerners as loud,
down-market intruders.</LD>
<LD>   So when the Rio de Janeiro state government cleaned up a patch of
North Zone sea and turned it into a chlorinated swimming pool the
size of three football fields, few expected it to upstage even trendy
Ipanema as the place to be and be seen.</LD>
<TE>   TV and movie stars have been dropping by o piscinao, the Big Pool.
The winner of "The Girl From the Piscinao" contest has become a
celebrity, the north's answer to "the Girl from Ipanema" of musical
fame. Pele, Brazil's god of soccer, has praised the piscinao on
television.</TE>
<TE>   "The piscinao has become a fever," says Cesar Marques, director of
the pool's recreation area. "It's the event of this summer."</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, it's hard to understand why.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Pool lies just beyond the Ramos shantytown. A ridge of
gray sand separates it from fetid Guanabara Bay. The back of the
Christ statue is visible in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   The pool regularly draws 30,000 or more on a sunny Saturday or
Sunday--far above government expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets so crowded, you can't see the sand," says lifeguard
Didimo Rodrigues. "You can't even see the water."</TE>
<TE>   Until the Big Pool came along, Guanabara Bay offered the only
beach in the North Zone, and it was an open sewer that attracted few
bathers. To get to southern beaches like Ipanema takes an hour with a
change of buses and costs about a dollar each way, a hefty sum for
people earning the minimum wage of less than $90 a month.</TE>
<TE>   So the government dug a vast pit near the shore in Ramos, lined it
with polyurethane and pumped in water from the bay. The sea water is
filtered and chlorinated as it comes in, and returns to the bay at
the other end. Every four days, the Big Pool's water is entirely
recycled.</TE>
<TE>   For all its success since it opened in December, it wasn't without
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The pool was nearly 7 feet deep in the middle and several children
subsequently drowned, so more sand was dumped in to make it
shallower.</TE>
<TE>   Bodies from gang wars were dumped in the piscinao, and the Third
Command drug gang went so far as to order beachgoers not to wear red,
the color of the rival Red Command. Most bathers obeyed the dictate,
though the gang has since relented and allowed all colors at the
pool.</TE>
<TE>   Beachgoers left behind seven tons of trash each weekend. Discarded
plastic bottles and potato chip bags drifted across its waters. To
fend off pollution, authorities had to quintuple the amount of
chlorine.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pilot project. It doesn't exist anywhere else," says
state Environment Secretary Andre Correa. "We're learning as we go."</TE>
<TE>   It's also a social statement, says professor Maria Sant'Anna, head
of urban sociology at Rio de Janeiro State University.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Zone is symbolic, much more than geographic," she says.
"This was the summer that the North Zone finally overcame that
symbolic division and 'the Girl from Ipanema.'"</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Jesus de Oliveira, a retired civil servant, says he used to
take the bus to Ipanema. "This place was dangerous, a real slum," he
says. "Now it's great. If it weren't for the piscinao, you wouldn't
be standing here talking to me now."</TE>
<TE>   The pool's popularity also has given the local economy a boost.
Alexandre Rangel, 21, used to earn about $130 a month as a motorcycle
delivery boy. Now he is one of a horde of vendors at the piscinao.</TE>
<TE>   He makes $65 on a good day selling beer, chips and grilled
sausage, and dreams of becoming a lawyer.</TE>

<HD>Raising the Dead in Crowded Singapore</HD>
<DH>Asia: Island nation is clearing a large Christian cemetery
to make way for housing complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEXA OLESEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE</DL>
<LD>L.F. Yong starts digging bodies just after dawn. On an average day,
he and his team of 20 workers will crack open 40 graves and empty
them of their bones by noon.</LD>
<LD>   Yong is responsible for the hands-on work in a government project
to clear Bidadari Cemetery, one of the largest Christian burial
grounds in Southeast Asia. The project will convert the resting place
for 58,000 dead into 12,000 centrally located, high-rise apartments
for the living.</LD>
<LD>   The project is fueled by crowded Singapore's hunger for land. The
tiny island, nestled between Malaysia and Indonesia, covers 251
square miles and has 4 million residents.</LD>
<TE>   In Singapore, government housing, highways and rapid transit lines
have been creeping ever closer to Bidadari Cemetery and will take
over within 10 years when the apartments and a new subway station are
completed.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the oasis of frangipani trees and rolling hills remains
peaceful. Rows of gravestones and marble statues are spread over 64
acres, their epitaphs engraved in a dozen languages, including
Chinese, English, Portuguese, Japanese and Hindi. The word Bidadari
itself comes from "widyadari," a type of Hindu nymph.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, the government has exhumed more than 36
cemeteries of different races and religions. Bidadari, one of the
largest to be cleared, contains the remains of 58,000 Christians
buried between 1907 and 1972, with most interred before 1951.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 68,000 bodies will be exhumed from a neighboring
Muslim section and reburied elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   All unclaimed Christian remains will be cremated by the government
and, unless the ashes are claimed within a year, they will be
scattered at sea. Christian families that want to rebury remains must
pay for it, but the government is reburying remains from faiths that
ban cremation, including Muslims, Jews and Parsis.</TE>
<TE>   Since March 2001, Singapore has published numerous notices about
the exhumation in newspapers here and in Australia, Britain and
Malaysia, but only 9,449 bodies have been claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Once those remains are exhumed, Yong's team will start digging up
and cremating the unclaimed, said Sum Foong Yee, a spokesman for the
Housing and Development Board, which is overseeing the project.</TE>
<TE>   In many cultures, cemeteries are considered landmarks and even
tourist attractions, but not in traditional Chinese communities,
noted Scottie Oakley, an American who is a guide at Singapore's Asian
Civilizations Museum and is helping produce a picture book to
preserve Bidadari's history before the bulldozers roll in.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley said many Chinese, who make up 75% of Singapore's
population, will not visit friends after paying respects at family
plots because they feel it's bad luck.</TE>
<TE>   "I could spend an afternoon in a cemetery, but in this culture
that would not happen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley and two other women, Sue Williams and Liesel Strauss, began
work on the coffee table book about the cemetery last year.About 10%
of those buried here are expatriates, businessmen from the colonial
era, missionaries or casualties of war.</TE>
<TE>   Others are sailors, such as Augustine Podmore Williams, the
Englishman thought to be the inspiration for Joseph Conrad's novel
"Lord Jim."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a big, hefty guy," said Sue Williams, a Briton who is not
related to the seafarer. "He died bankrupt. He was known as 'Daddy."'</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most in the cemetery, his small headstone will not be lost
when the cemetery is razed. His is one of a handful of markers deemed
"historically significant" by Singapore's National Heritage Board and
it will be put in a memorial garden, along with an ornate iron gate
from Bidadari.</TE>
<TE>   Families can take sculptures and gravestones home but most have
not. Unclaimed headstones are smashed and put into a pit.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese people tend to be uncomfortable having tombstones in their
homes, said Brigid Tracy Tan, whose great-grandfather was exhumed
from Bidadari. Her family left the tombstone and marble cross behind.</TE>
<TE>   Tan, a curator for the Singapore Art Museum, spent hours
scrutinizing Bidadari's sculptures, looking for "aesthetically
significant" examples. But she found most--even beautiful ones--were
mass-produced. One of the two pieces she rescued is an intricately
carved marble headstone for 12 Roman Catholic nuns who died between
1907 and 1956.</TE>

<HD>Bolivian River Flows From Pristine to Putrid</HD>

<DL>LA PAZ, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>The Choqueyapu River used to be the town's treasure, filled with the
gold that five centuries ago attracted the Spaniards to this basin in
the Andes.</LD>
<LD>   Precious metals are nowhere to be found near the Choqueyapu these
days. Human feces, dead dogs and noxious chemicals fill the waters as
they wind through La Paz, bringing disease and overpowering smells to
those unlucky enough to live near its banks.</LD>
<LD>   "The Choqueyapu River is no longer a source of pride for La Paz,"
said Fernando Cajias, a historian. "It is now just a dead, dirty
river that shows the failures of this city."</LD>
<TE>   Not only is the river dead, it's deadly. In late February, a
fierce rainstorm combined with inadequate drainage systems to swell
the Choqueyapu out of its banks, sweeping away dozens of homes and
drowning more than 60 people.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy could have been prevented, city planners say.
Officials have known for years about the flooding dangers from a
fast-flowing river that drops 2,000 feet from its source 14,000 feet
above sea level to the city, which lies in a basin where many rivers
meet.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city turned stretches of the Choqueyapu into canals
after a deluge in the 1930s, flooding is still common during the
rainy season, which hits La Paz from late November to March.</TE>
<TE>   A $100-million plan to improve flood controls was drawn up years
ago but, as is often the case in South America's poorest nation,
there was no money for it. The city is hoping for outside donations
so that it can finally begin putting the ideas into practice.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always felt the importance of implementing the plan, but
there simply haven't been the resources," said Guido Capra, a city
councilman and engineer. "But there didn't have to be so many deaths
[during the February flood]. This plan needs to be a priority, now."</TE>
<TE>   What will probably take even longer to deal with is the
contamination filling the river--a tragedy in itself, said Waldo
Vargas, the city's environmental director.</TE>
<TE>   "This river is born out of a glacier," he said. "Its waters are
impeccable. There are various categories of water, and this river
starts with the highest."</TE>
<TE>   But by the time the waters reach downtown La Paz, they have
dropped from class A to class E--the filthiest, Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   The river barely stands a chance as it winds about 25 miles
through La Paz, encountering all sorts of contamination and
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Small mountain communities near the river's source muddy the water
while extracting peat to sell to gardeners. Farther along, people dig
out sand and rocks to sell for construction.</TE>
<TE>   But the most serious trouble begins on the outskirts of the city,
where construction workers regularly dump unwanted bricks or cement.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes La Paz's industrial zone, where textile factories let
their chemicals drip into the river and slaughterhouses toss in
animal fat and blood.</TE>
<TE>   One of the worst--and most unlikely--polluters is Aguas del
Illimani, the company that provides water to La Paz's 800,000
inhabitants. While purifying the water taken from the Choqueyapu, the
company's machinery produces sludge that oozes back into the river.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the Choqueyapu flows underground, traveling through
flood-control channels downtown. Even here, the river is a garbage
can. Most apartment buildings above the channels have connected their
sanitation systems to the waterway.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas said that of the 500 tons of garbage produced in La Paz
each day, at least one-fifth finds its way into the Choqueyapu and
other rivers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a result of a complete lack of education," Vargas said.
"To most of the people living here, this river has always been dirty.
They don't know what it's like to use a river for recreation instead
of as an instrument for transporting garbage."</TE>
<TE>   He has begun a pilot program along a remote section of the
Choqueyapu seeking to teach people about the dangers of polluting
their own water.</TE>
<TE>   The chemicals and garbage create a stench when the river leaves
the tunnels of downtown and flows south, passing by a small community
of tent-dwellers who bathe and wash clothes in the filthy river.</TE>
<TE>   La Paz was originally built in the high plains of the Andes, but
when the Spaniards discovered gold in the river in the 16th century,
it was refounded lower, and the Choqueyapu became a border between
the social classes.</TE>
<TE>   Indigenous people who cultivated potatoes--Choqueyapu is "where
potatoes grow" in the Aymara language--were pushed to the west side
of the river. The Spaniards built their houses and businesses on the
east bank.</TE>
<TE>   Today the class divider is elevation. La Paz lies 12,000 feet
above sea level and those with money prefer to live downhill, where
it's warmer and there's more oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   The poor, many of them indigenous people, live closer to the
river's source, in the high Andes, where the air is thin and the
weather harsh.</TE>
<TE>   As the river descends, it passes the middle- and working-class
districts in the center of La Paz, then the land occupied by La Paz's
small wealthy sector at the bottom of the basin. But the rich build
their homes away from the river.</TE>
<TE>   Those who must fully contend with the contamination are the rural
people living farther south--and often suffering breathing problems
and cholera, Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly farmers use the river's water--now filled with chemicals
and bacteria--to irrigate crops. Their fruits and vegetables go back
to city markets and often cause stomach illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Although people like Vargas dream that the river will one day flow
through the city crystal-clear, many are skeptical given the public's
apathy and the government's lack of emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   "On a political level, the environment is not considered to be all
that urgent," said engineer David Rada, a consultant to the
government's environment department. "Building a school pays off a
lot more politically than preserving natural resources."</TE>

<HD>Serving Hope With Cappuccino</HD>
<DH>Europe: Slovakian restaurant gives mentally disabled people
a chance to work as waiters. Patience is a requirement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA LORINCZOVA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BRATISLAVA, Slovakia</DL>
<LD>At the Radnicka cafe, tucked inside Bratislava's medieval City Hall,
waiter Frantisek Toth might have to ask three or four times what kind
of coffee you'd like.</LD>
<LD>   Anywhere else, a customer might get aggravated and leave. Here,
almost nobody does--not after an encounter with the smiling Toth and
his sincere apologies.</LD>
<LD>   Dealing with people like Toth, one of the cafe's five waiters with
mental retardation or severe learning disabilities, is a new
experience for most Slovaks.</LD>
<TE>   Until the fall of communism in 1989, disabled people were usually
shut away in state institutions. Such people, the communist
authorities believed, were better off isolated from the "healthy
population."</TE>
<TE>   The Radnicka, whose name means "little city hall," opened last
year and is an example of a significant shift in this nation of 5.4
million people toward integrating the mentally and physically
disabled into everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other way ... we must learn how to live together,"
said Viera Zahorcova, director of the Agency for Supported
Employment, which is helping to train people with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Slovak government hasn't counted the nation's handicapped, but
estimates that it is 2% to 8% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   Some people worried that Slovakia's 20% unemployment rate might
make it difficult to start putting the handicapped into the
workforce, but there hasn't been any public criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Still, starting the Radnicka wasn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   It took a lot of energy to persuade officials the project could
work, Zahorcova said. After financing was secured, and City Hall
donated space for the cafe, the disabled workers had to be trained to
brew coffee, interact with strangers and handle other aspects of
running a cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Zahorcova urges Slovaks not to come to the cafe out of charity and
sympathy, but because it offers friendly service--if a bit slow at
times--and a pleasant atmosphere in one of Bratislava's most charming
old buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll definitely come back," said Elena Herkova, browsing the
handcrafts made by disabled artisans and offered for sale at the
cafe. "It's a great idea in a good location."</TE>
<TE>   Toth isn't very talkative, but he says he loves his job, the best
one he's ever had. Dressed in his uniform of dark pants, white shirt
and blue vest, he serves customers while another waiter who has no
disabilities deals with money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good job ... I like to serve people, and I especially like
to make coffee, be it Viennese [with whipped cream] or cappuccino,"
said Toth, 23, who needed six months' training before he could face
customers.</TE>
<TE>   For companies with 20 or more employees, Slovak law requires that
for every 20 workers, the equivalent of one full-time job be set
aside for the disabled. Companies that are unable to provide such
positions must pay $350 to $700 to the labor office in lieu of each
job. The money goes for training and job creation for the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Some employers, such as health care facilities, the military and
fire departments, are exempt.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Orgonasova, president of the Alliance of Organizations of
Disabled People in Slovakia, said it will take a few generations for
Slovak businesses to learn how to employ such people and for the
disabled to learn how to present themselves "with their education or
skills, and not with the type of disability they have."</TE>
<TE>   "The young disabled feel they are already integrated," Orgonasova
said. "It is a bit more difficult with the older, who are used to
institutions."</TE>

<HD>A Cinderella Prom for 2 Troubled Girls</HD>
<DH>Society: Group home residents did chores, didn't misbehave
to earn chance to dance the night away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGIE WAGNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HENDERSON, Nev.</DL>
<LD>The lavender skirt and shimmery top have been laid out for hours. Her
nails freshly painted, the teenager walks by her room again just to
look one more time.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never been to a dance," she says, glancing at her prom
outfit.</LD>
<LD>   Soon someone will come to do her makeup and put up her hair. And
later, Tiffany and her friend Crystal will go to their senior
prom--something they never thought they would get to do.</LD>
<TE>   The girls, both 17, live in a group home where almost every
activity from eating to sleeping is scheduled for them. Visits with
friends or after-school activities are monitored and planned. The 13
girls placed at Regina Hall have exhausted the foster care system and
have severe behavioral problems because of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   They ended up here when they ran out of options.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany has been in state custody since she was 2. Her father
died, and she met her mother just once. She still celebrates the day
she was adopted--even though she was removed from the family after
officials found evidence that she was being abused.</TE>
<TE>   In a children's home, Tiffany learned she had a sister. But that
sister died of diabetes last year at 20, and Tiffany keeps an urn of
her ashes on her dresser.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a lifetime of hardship, she is much like any other
teenager. She likes to dance, listens to hip-hop music and hopes to
go to college. And she really wants to go to her prom.</TE>
<TE>   Regina Hall's auxiliary board raised money to buy dresses for
Tiffany and Crystal. They earned the chance to go by staying out of
trouble in the weeks before the prom; they completed all their
chores, didn't skip school and didn't run away.</TE>
<TE>   Because of neglect, the girls lack maturity and may struggle to
make good decisions. Some turned to drugs or lived on the streets.
They were taken from their parents or never even knew them. Foster
homes didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   "These girls come from really tough circumstances," says Barbara
Marz, board president for Regina Hall, which is run by Catholic
Charities of Southern Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   The prom is doubly special for them. "Our goal," Marz says, "was
to provide that normal experience that most teenage girls want to
do--just to kind of feel like a little princess for a day."</TE>
<TE>   The girls have waited weeks for this Saturday night. After the
dance at the Henderson Convention Center, they are allowed to go to
dinner with friends, but must be back in the home by 11p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I get to be a normal teenager," Tiffany says. "I'm more nervous
than excited. I didn't get asked to go, but I'm going."</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany is a senior at Basic High School, which is hosting the
prom. Her friend Crystal, who dropped out of school, is working to
get her high school equivalency certificate.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal and brushes on taupe-colored eye shadow. "My last dance
was eighth grade," she says.</TE>
<TE>   That was before she ran away from an uncle's house, where she had
been living since her mother died when Crystal was 11. She never knew
her father. She became a ward of the state two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I could have done stuff different," she says. "Some of
it's my fault."</TE>
<TE>   But tonight she will try to forget all that.</TE>
<TE>   "To just feel normal, to meet people, to have fun, to get away
from the house," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In Tiffany's room, Geri Smith, a member of the auxiliary board,
arrives to style the teen's hair. She brushes the long, brown hair up
into a ponytail, then makes sections of big curls. Smith helps with
makeup too.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I look so cute!" Tiffany says, admiring herself in a mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Several other girls peer in at their housemate, and Tawana, 17,
hurries to write a poem about the night.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most special day of their lives that they'll never
forget," she writes. "To be able to tell their young ones about their
very first prom day."</TE>
<TE>   Crystal finishes her makeup, and Smith helps with her hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to be a model," Crystal tells Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Then, she shuts her bedroom door and, a few minutes later, makes
her debut.</TE>
<TE>   "She's coming out!" one girl screams as the group gathers around
Crystal's door.</TE>
<TE>   She twirls around, and her friends tell her how beautiful she
looks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny seeing me like this," Tiffany says, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal worries that her tummy sticks out in her slinky dress.</TE>
<TE>   "Suck in your gut; don't eat too much and you should be all
right," offers employee Shandya Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal and Tiffany pose for pictures, then beg shift supervisor
Muriel Zachary not to take them to the dance in the van with a
charity logo painted on the side.</TE>
<TE>   Zachary agrees to use an unmarked van, and the girls go outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody better be awake at 11!" Crystal yells over her
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   They arrive at the prom and soon blend into the crowd of teenagers
in tuxedos and fancy gowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I get to be Cinderella for a day," Tiffany says, heading toward
the dance floor.</TE>

<HD>Clash in Portland Over Urban Growth Limits</HD>
<DH>Planning: Ballot measure would loosen restrictions on
building. Opponents fear its passage will lead to more sprawl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM McCALL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>One of the first major metropolitan areas in the nation to throw up
an imaginary fence around the suburbs to rein in sprawl is deciding
whether to loosen the restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   An "urban growth boundary" that has preserved forests and farmland
on the doorsteps of Oregon's largest city has made Portland a
national model for controlling sprawl.</LD>
<LD>   Metro, an elected regional agency created in 1979, decides when
and where the line can be extended, based on population growth within
the imaginary fence.</LD>
<TE>   But a property-rights group, Oregonians in Action, says Metro is
too stingy in expanding the boundary. The result, the group argues,
has been overcrowded neighborhoods, traffic jams and a burden on
public services in Portland and its suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   "They're throwing out land use policy most citizens don't want,"
said Larry George, the group's executive director. "The problem is,
Metro isn't listening to citizens."</TE>
<TE>   A measure on Tuesday's primary ballot proposed by the group would
prohibit Metro from setting minimum population density requirements
within the urban growth boundary. That has been the regional body's
main tool for containing sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics of Measure 26-11 say groups backing it--including
Realtors and home builders--are mainly interested in extending the
urban growth boundary so they can profit from developing land that
now lies outside the line.</TE>
<TE>   "Oregonians in Action is taking advantage of the fact that most
voters don't understand the urban growth boundary. They, along with
the home builders and Realtors, are trying to blame everything on
Metro," said Evan Manvel, research director for 1,000 Friends of
Oregon, a nonprofit group founded to help shape land use policy and
protect quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   To head off the measure, Metro is offering its own proposal on the
primary ballot--Measure 26-29--that is backed by the mayors of all 24
cities and the three urban counties covered by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The Metro proposal would modify its charter to maintain its
control over urban density. But additional planning would be required
to "protect the livability of existing neighborhoods" and ensure
adequate services, utilities and park access.</TE>
<TE>   George said the Oregonians in Action proposal would force Metro to
start from scratch by seeking approval from individual neighborhoods
and cities.</TE>
<TE>   But Rex Burkholder, one of the seven Metro councilors, says it
would bury Metro in added paperwork and block long-term planning. "It
would eliminate all controls on sprawl," Burkholder said.</TE>
<TE>   The Portland metropolitan area grew from a population of 1.5
million in 1990 to 1.92 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Burkholder said filling available space within the urban growth
boundary before allowing expansion into outlying areas has helped
preserve neighborhoods and farms, avoiding the kind of suburban
flight that caused inner city decay in other metro areas.</TE>
<TE>   But Kelly Ross, government affairs director for the Home Builders
Assn. of Metropolitan Portland, says Metro has ignored warnings from
the construction industry that the area will run out of "buildable"
land faster than Metro predicts.</TE>
<TE>   "There is intense frustration and often outright hostility out
there," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the pressure for expansion has simply moved development
across the Columbia River to neighboring Clark County, Wash., where
scattered housing and business growth leaves neighborhoods
disconnected from public transportation, services and each other,
said Clark Williams-Derry of Northwest Environment Watch in Seattle,
which studies population growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The contrast is very stark," Williams-Derry said.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Meck, senior researcher for the American Planning Assn. in
Chicago, said the trend throughout the country has been to assign
urban planning to some kind of regional government to avoid the kind
of squabbling between cities and neighborhoods that has helped
encourage suburban sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   "While it sounds very populist to say let each local government
decide about density, it leads to bickering or dumping problems on
each other," Meck said, adding that neighborhoods cannot set policy
because they are not governments.</TE>
<TE>   The planning association has developed model legislation for
managing urban growth based partly on Oregon and on other states,
including Washington, Florida, Maine, Minnesota, Maryland, Tennessee
and Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Meck said the model calls for regional planning that coordinates
the efforts of cities and counties, the opposite of the Oregonians in
Action proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have growth without considering the impact on other
jurisdictions," Meck said.</TE>

<HD>Critics Raising Concerns About Cadiz Water Project</HD>
<DH>Resources: The stakes are high--financially and
politically--for the Santa Monica company and its proposed partner,
the Metropolitan Water District.</DH>

<DL>CADIZ, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Sometime in the next few weeks, a federal agency is expected to issue
the final environmental approval necessary to turn this former Mojave
Desert railroad outpost into a billion-dollar water development
project.</LD>
<LD>   As the culmination of a laborious five-year environmental review,
that ruling from the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management
would represent a milestone for the project and for its sponsor,
Cadiz Inc. The politically well-connected company, which has been
growing grapes and citrus fruits on a patchwork of money-losing
irrigated tracts across the San Joaquin and Coachella valleys sees
the Mojave project as the linchpin of its plan to transform itself
into a global water development enterprise.</LD>
<LD>   The stakes are high. The project to store trillions of gallons of
Colorado River water in the sands beneath Cadiz's 27,000-acre tract
could earn the company about $500 million in fees over the next 50
years. Cadiz hopes it also will give it a foothold in a prospective
boom market for water in California and other parched regions around
the world. As a token of its ambitions, the company this year named
former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to head a new subsidiary to
pursue similar water deals in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   The Mojave project also is of great importance to Cadiz's proposed
partner, the giant Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California. The project would be one of the most complex and costly
undertaken by the MWD. Such a financial partnership with a private
corporation would be unique in the district's history.</TE>
<TE>   Under tentative contract terms approved a year ago by the MWD
board, the district and Cadiz would split the $150-million
construction cost of the project, which involves pumping water
through a 35-mile pipeline connecting the MWD's Colorado River
Aqueduct and the Mojave storage site. There it would be banked
underground and, along with existing supply from an aquifer
underlying the tract, pumped back to the aqueduct as an emergency
supply during droughts.</TE>
<TE>   As the MWD's 37-member board prepares to take a final vote on the
project, possibly this summer, some of the agency's directors are
questioning whether the massive investment makes financial sense, and
whether a partnership with Cadiz is appropriate for a public water
district.</TE>
<TE>   These questions also arise because Cadiz lacks experience building
or managing a water project of this scale. The company would play no
role in managing construction or operating project once it is
completed. That would be the responsibility of the MWD, which would
foot the $1-million annual bill for operation and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz's ability to meet its financial obligations also is open to
question. The company, whose chairman and chief executive, Keith
Brackpool, once pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to
securities trading and later was forced to resign an executive post
because of his outside business dealings, has never turned an annual
profit. Its total losses from 1993 through 2001 come to more than
$105 million.</TE>
<TE>   At year-end 2001 its debt of $141.5 million--much of it carrying
high junk-bond interest rates--dwarfed its shareholder equity of
$17.7 million. That debt includes a $35-million credit line from ING
Barings that Cadiz has renewed periodically as a source of working
capital until the water project begins generating revenue. The
implicit cost of that loan will start to rise if Cadiz fails to repay
it by the end of July.</TE>
<TE>   An Abundance of Political Connections</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, the source of much of Cadiz's initial $75-million
capital contribution to its partnership with the MWD would be the
water district itself.</TE>
<TE>   Under the negotiated terms, on the day the final contract is
signed the MWD would front Cadiz more than $54 million in
"prepayment" for 195 billion gallons of water storage. How much of
that money would be available to pay for construction is unclear: In
January, as a condition of extending its $35-million loan for an
additional year, ING Barings inserted a provision requiring that the
loan be repaid from money Cadiz receives from the MWD for the
project's construction.</TE>
<TE>   "If its lenders make a claim on our $54 million, how does the
project get built?" asked Peer Swan, an MWD board member representing
the Orange County Municipal Water District. "Cadiz is not the
strongest player. What guarantee is there if it goes bankrupt?"</TE>
<TE>   What the company does have in abundance are political connections.
Former  Rep. Tony Coelho, an important Democratic Party fund-raiser,
serves on the Cadiz board. The Democratic pedigree of the newly hired
Babbitt extends from his 10 years as Arizona governor in the 1970s
and '80s to his service in the Clinton Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   But by far the company's leading political contact is Gov. Gray
Davis, who has named Brackpool to at least two statewide advisory
panels on water resources.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the company's consistent losses and the British-born
Brackpool's ineligibility to vote, Cadiz and its CEO have been among
Davis' leading financial contributors since 1998. Records show that
the company and  Brackpool contributed $134,000 to Davis' 1998
gubernatorial campaign,  part of the $415,000 in total donations they
made to candidates statewide. From 1999 through 2001, the company
contributed an additional $101,187 to Davis' reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool also has hosted numerous fund-raising events for Davis
and other candidates, some of them at the Manhattan Country Club in
Manhattan Beach, owned by a Brackpool partnership.</TE>
<TE>   All this leads some MWD board members to speculate that district
executives have placed the Cadiz project on the fast track--ahead of
other, possibly worthier, programs--to placate Davis.</TE>
<TE>   MWD officials deny that. "I've stated to the board that we're not
interested in this project because of the participating company," MWD
Chief Executive Ronald R. Gastelum said. "We're interested because of
the potential asset and its location."</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool, 44, labels concerns about Cadiz's financial stability
as "ridiculous" and the product of "ludicrous unfounded allegations."</TE>
<TE>   "Time and time and time again we have raised the money for this
project," the entrepreneur said in an recent interview at the
company's Santa Monica headquarters. "We have withstood a five-year
process.... This company has always raised every penny it said it was
going to raise."</TE>
<TE>   He said the company plans to restructure its balance sheet soon by
merging its agricultural subsidiary with a company run by the wealthy
Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal ibn Abdulaziz al Saud, a transaction
designed to provide Cadiz with an equity infusion of as much as $80
million. (The merger has not been completed, however, and Brackpool
told investors two weeks ago that it has run into some regulatory
snags overseas.)</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool also dismisses charges that political influence has
played a role in the MWD's consideration of the project. "I don't
think any work that I've done for the governor or any relationship
that I've had with the governor has been relevant to the project at
all," he said. "The state has nothing to do with this project. There
is no state regulatory involvement in this project."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether opponents of Cadiz can muster enough votes
on the MWD board to kill or defer the project. Several board members,
including representatives of the powerful Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power, have expressed strong support for the project.
Others who have expressed reservations also have said they would keep
an open mind.</TE>
<TE>   Still, skepticism on the MWD board runs high. "If we had a new
governor," said James Edwards, an MWD board member representing the
Foothill Municipal Water District, "I believe this thing would fall
by the wayside and die a natural death."</TE>
<TE>   The Cadiz project first bubbled to the surface in the mid-1990s,
when the MWD was laboring under crises on several fronts.</TE>
<TE>   First came the water crisis. Neighboring states and the federal
government were insisting that California take steps to live within
its statutory allocation of 4.4 million acre-feet of water a year
from the Colorado River. The state had consistently exceeded this
figure, largely by exploiting water left unused by neighboring
Arizona and Nevada. After those growing states started consuming
their full allocations, California relied on the Department of the
Interior to drain extra water from Lake Mead every year to meet the
state's unslaked thirst.</TE>
<TE>   No one considered this a long-term solution, however. California
eventually agreed to bring demand into line with its legal allocation
by 2015, at which point the surplus supplies would cease.</TE>
<TE>   The implications of the reduction were particularly dire for the
MWD, which received 550,000 acre-feet of the state's allocation
(about 180 trillion gallons, or enough to serve 1.1 million families
for a year) but customarily consumed an additional 400,000 or more.
The district hastily began drawing up a list of conservation
programs, new supply sources and storage projects to meet its new
constraints.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a political crisis simmered over the MWD's incessant
squabbling with neighboring water agencies about various issues
relating to the Colorado River supply. Politicians, including Davis,
were quick to weigh in.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis had nothing but disdain for the Met," recalled
Francesca Krauel, a San Diego lawyer then serving on the MWD board.
The MWD feared that an angry governor might move abruptly to end its
decades of proud independence.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz glimmered as a multifaceted solution to all these issues. By
stockpiling Colorado River water under the Cadiz sands in years when
a surplus is available, the MWD could offset shortages in dry years
and after surpluses are no longer available. A partnership with Cadiz
would prove that the district was able to reach an innovative deal
with a private entity at a time American private enterprise was
lionized as the most efficient in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much criticism of the Met as a monopoly, with people
asking if anyone could do a deal in which the Met doesn't control,"
said John R. Wodraska, MWD general manager in the mid-1990s. "The Met
had an incentive to show it could do a public-private partnership."</TE>
<TE>   Company's Focus Shifted to Selling Water</TE>
<TE>   That Brackpool was a friend of the governor was implicitly seen as
a plus. It was true that the MWD was not a state agency, but Davis'
authority over statewide water matters made him a dangerous nemesis.</TE>
<TE>   "The thinking was: You make a deal with Keith Brackpool, and
you're on the good side of Gray Davis," Krauel said.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz, as it happens, had its roots not in large-scale water
development, but in a plan to use aerial-mapping technology to find
underground water resources and use them to grow crops in the desert.
Brackpool, initially brought into the plan in 1983 as an investment
banker, stayed to help turn it into a business.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 10 years, he and his partners assembled several
sizable tracts in the Mojave largely by buying up old railroad
concessions. In time the company's focus shifted from farming to
selling water.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1990s, Brackpool had concluded that high labor costs
and harsh regulation had placed "California agriculture ... in
terminal decline," as he put it in a recent interview with The Times,
by allowing Mexican growers to nibble away at its lucrative markets.
About the same time, he said, "the whole Colorado River issue was
really becoming important and I thought, 'This is going to get really
interesting.'" Cadiz still owned water rights.</TE>
<TE>   Ups and Downs of Brackpool's Career</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool soon acquired a reputation around the state as a
visionary with a no-nonsense platform of aggressive action on water
policy. "How would Southern California ever be able to attract new
capital investment," he said, "if every year you had to wait to find
out whether the secretary of the Interior cut your water supply off
or not? It was certainly no way to manage the future of the largest
and fastest-growing part of the state."</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool spoke with the elan of an innovative, successful
businessman. But his career had had its ups and downs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, for example, he pleaded guilty in London to criminal
charges that included dealing in securities without a license. The
charges involved Nishco Portfolio Management, an investment firm of
which he was part-owner and which, among other things, handled
offshore investments for wealthy Kenyans. Brackpool, who paid a fine
of $3,200, later referred to the charges as the equivalent of
misdemeanors. A spokesman for the London City Fraud Squad, which
brought the charges, said the agency no longer had records of the
case, which would have been shredded by 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1991, Brackpool was forced to resign his post as chief
executive in North America for Albert Fisher Group, a highflying
British food company whose chairman had hand-picked him for the job.
The resignation was the direct result of Brackpool's personal
dealings with Polly Peck, a British conglomerate that had imploded in
a spectacular accounting scandal resembling the Enron Corp. affair.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was an executive of Albert Fisher and Polly Peck was a
direct competitor, Brackpool personally guaranteed a $10-million loan
Polly Peck made to him and several partners to enable them to buy out
a Polly Peck subsidiary. When Polly Peck collapsed, its receivers
demanded the money and the arrangement came to light.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool's involvement undermined the credibility of Fisher's
chairman, Tony Millar, who lost his job soon after Brackpool's
departure.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool said he voluntarily resigned to devote time to settling
the Polly Peck claim. He also insisted that the transaction was a
legitimate business deal undermined by the unexpected crisis at Polly
Peck. "No one thought when we went into it that Polly Peck would go
bust," he said. Eventually, Brackpool said, he and the receivers of
Polly Peck settled all outstanding claims.</TE>
<TE>   Little of this background was widely known in the U.S. when
Brackpool brought his water storage proposal to the MWD in 1997, nor
is it widely known today.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, Wodraska said, MWD officials harbored doubts about
Cadiz's finances almost from the start.</TE>
<TE>   "The question about Cadiz always was the economics," he said.
"Cadiz Inc.'s long-term viability was always a concern."</TE>
<TE>   The project also ran into stiff opposition from environmentalists,
who questioned Cadiz's claim that as much as 30,000 acre-feet a year
could be extracted from an aquifer under its parcel. (Cadiz would
charge the MWD more than twice as much for this "indigenous" water
than it would for the storage component.) Experts from the U.S.
Geological Survey contended that the figure was closer to 3,000
acre-feet, based on what it computed is the rate at which the water
is naturally replenished.</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancy was important because extracting too much water
could expose the aquifer to environmental contamination from
neighboring brine deposits.</TE>
<TE>   The disagreement was never resolved; instead it was finessed by an
agreement to install a network of monitoring wells around the tract
to detect early signs of contamination, and to cease the extraction
if they appear.</TE>
<TE>   But MWD officials have worked hard to resolve the financial issues
raised by Cadiz's fiscal condition. Gastelum said the final contract
to be presented to the MWD and Cadiz boards will insulate the
district's assets from the company's fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, it will give the district veto power over all
of Cadiz's financing terms, such as any that might expose the
district's contribution to the claims of existing creditors. The
project would have to be operated by a new subsidiary fenced off from
most of Cadiz's existing liabilities. (Such an arrangement would
require the approval of Cadiz's existing creditors.) The negotiated
terms also call for the district to gain ownership of the land and
construction if Cadiz defaults on its obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were to disappear, the Met would essentially get the
project," said MWD general counsel Jeffrey Kightlinger.</TE>
<TE>   MWD officials say working with Cadiz does have its pluses. For one
thing, the company has shown remarkable staying power by surviving
years of litigation and environmental scrutiny while better-heeled
private investors have bailed out of similar water projects. And
because many of the MWD's other proposed water supply programs may
die because of political or environmental challenges, the advanced
stage this one has reached adds to its value.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some water experts and board members say it is not too late
to reexamine the project and its financial terms. Although Brackpool
has long intimated that the Cadiz project is all but indispensable to
Southern California's water future, that's no longer an unchallenged
view at the Los Angeles headquarters of the MWD.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say their goal is to build about 3 million
acre-feet of storage capacity that can provide 300,000 to 400,000
acre-feet a year to the Colorado River Aqueduct in a dry year. Any
more than that might be wasted, as the aqueduct's total capacity is
only 1.25 million acre-feet and other sources could help keep it
filled.</TE>
<TE>   MWD Considering Large-Scale Storage</TE>
<TE>   Of five separate projects under consideration, Cadiz included, the
district would need to complete only two or three to reach that goal.
The MWD's $67-million Hayfield project, which is on MWD-owned land
adjacent to the aqueduct near its eastern end, already is operating
and eventually could provide up to half the needed storage and
transmission capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The MWD also may have to reconsider moving ahead with plans for
large-scale storage, which would require years of a reliable supply
of surplus water from the Colorado River. The federal government
recently threatened to cut off the surplus next year out of
irritation with California's lagging water planning. If that happens,
said the MWD's Gastelum, the district probably would put all storage
programs on indefinite hold.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool, for his part, continues to exude confidence that the
Cadiz project will win approval from the MWD board and will be
profitable for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   As the price of water rises, he told investors in a conference
call two weeks ago, the MWD will view its contracted cost of water
from Cadiz as "very advantageous." Continuing droughts in the
Midwest, environmental challenges to alternative California projects
and rising demand for water will only make the Cadiz program seem
more promising as time goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "We just continue to see the fundamentals moving absolutely in the
direction we want," he said.</TE>

<HD>Housing Industry's Foundation Is Firm</HD>

<LD>Home sales and prices are rising in California and many other parts
of the country. Stocks of home-building companies have been raising
the roof.</LD>
<LD>   But now some experts are crying "bubble," predicting a downturn in
home buying and home prices and financial distress among mortgage
holders.</LD>
<LD>   Is housing a bubble about to burst? It's not likely, thanks in
part to old-fashioned American bureaucracy.</LD>
<TE>   Land-use regulations, anti-sprawl ordinances and other regulations
on building, abundant not only in California but in Florida, Texas
and most other areas, are having the unintended effect of limiting
land for home building. This is creating housing shortages in many
locales.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, home sales probably will set new records again this
year as the economy recovers. Home prices are unlikely to fall. And
the home-building industry will continue to demonstrate its new
strengths in finance, technology and changing competitive dynamics.</TE>
<TE>   And as they always do, regulations favor larger home-building
companies over smaller ones, because only the big firms can absorb
the costs of lengthy permitting processes, lobbying of local councils
and meeting community and environmental demands.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, an industry of about 79,000 home builders is consoli- dating
into a dozen or so giant national firms, plus about 30 mid-size
companies and a great mass of small, local builders.</TE>
<TE>   The industry has changed profoundly in the last decade. When
recession hit in the early 1990s, the average home builder was caught
with unsold houses or inventories of land that had to be sold to pay
bank loans, which were the industry's chief source of finances in
those days.</TE>
<TE>   But as the '90s progressed, publicly owned home-building firms
built up their balance sheets, devised ways to option rather than buy
land and to attract long-term senior debt financing from Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an industry of stronger firms that do business
differently than a decade ago. Conscious of the need to earn higher
returns on capital, they build no homes on spec but collect
deposits--typically 5% of the eventual price--from buyers before
starting construction.</TE>
<TE>   With less land available, they build fewer houses. "In the late
1980s, when California was booming, the industry built 260,000 homes
in the state," says Bruce Karatz, chairman of KB Home, a Los
Angeles-based nationwide builder. "Now California is booming again
and the industry will build 140,000 homes in the state this year."</TE>
<TE>   Housing shortages are endemic in California. "Supply can never
meet demand in virtually all price ranges in California," says
Karatz, who has led the company since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   But California is not alone. "That statement is true for many
other markets in the country," says Stuart Miller, chairman of Lennar
Corp., a Miami-based builder that in the last decade has spread by
acquisition to California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Miller is saying the days of worrying about a
housing glut are over.</TE>
<TE>   The Maryland-Virginia area around Washington "is possibly the
hottest market in the country right now," says Chad Dreier, chairman
of Ryland Group Inc., a major home builder that is based in Calabasas
but builds homes in most regions of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Ryland specializes in homes for first-time buyers. Yet the median
price of the 13,095 homes it built and sold last year was
$208,000--and Ryland does only a minor fraction of its business in
California, where median home prices are 25% to 50% higher.</TE>
<TE>   Such price levels are the reason some experts predict that
dwindling affordability will stop the housing boom or threaten the
economic system with overly debt-burdened mortgage holders.</TE>
<TE>   But Brian Hale, executive vice president of Countrywide Home
Loans, the nation's largest mort- gage lender (and a subsidiary of
Calabasas-based Countrywide Credit Industries Inc.) sees no such
danger. Reforms of credit standards by the Federal National Mortgage
Assn., or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, or
Freddie Mac, have "broadened the market to more new buyers" without
undue risk. Mortgage default rates are falling, not rising, Hale
says.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, sharply higher interest rates would clobber housing
affordability. But the small rises in mortgage rates seen in the last
week are not cause for concern as long as the economy truly is
recovering. "Short-term movements in mortgage interest are less of a
factor in home markets than essentials of job growth and consumer
confidence," says Miller of Lennar.</TE>
<TE>   The housing market today is being driven by population growth--the
grown children of baby boomers plus generations of immigrants and
children of immigrants. And home ownership, now a reality for more
than 68% of of the U.S. population, will continue to rise, analysts
predict.</TE>
<TE>   The market is vibrant and innovative. It is routine for home
builders to offer prospective buyers options for interior decor
before construction. Specific orders then can be sent to the
construction site via the Internet, and the cost of extras can be
included in the mortgage and amortized over 30 years. Home builders
also earn better profit margins on decor options.</TE>
<TE>   Housing markets do decline to be sure. In the high-tech bust of
2001, home prices fell 25% in Silicon Valley, estimates analyst James
Wilson of JMP Securities, a San Francisco investment firm. But even
home sales in Silicon Valley are picking up again.</TE>
<TE>   And in Southern California, where housing shortages are severe in
Los Angeles and Orange counties, the relative availability of land in
the Inland Empire for building and homes in the $200,000- to-$300,000
price range is drawing home builders such as Irvine-based
Standard-Pacific Corp. and Red Bank, N.J.- based Hovnanian
Enterprises Inc.--which recently acquired California's Forecast
Homes.</TE>
<TE>   Strength in housing, of course, is a traditional support for the
entire economy--the home purchase leads to sales of furniture and
appliances, insurance, financing and many other products and
services. That's why the federal government has traditionally
supported housing, with tax deduction for mortgage interest as well
as the creation of mortgage support agencies such as Fannie Mae.</TE>
<TE>   But home building as an industry always has been seen as a
cyclical business of local, under-capitalized contractors.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways it still is, with stocks of major home-building firms
selling at low, eight to 10 times multiples of their rising earnings.
"Industries being investigated by the SEC get a higher multiple than
we do," quips Miller of Lennar.</TE>
<TE>   The homebuilding industry has changed. It will be interesting to
see whether Wall Street's view of it also changes.</TE>

<LD>Regarding electricity and other areas of endeavor, medical care
included, we have to get the private sector completely out of the
picture ["Regulation, the Cure for Energy Ills, Is Coming," May 12].
They have no business bumbling around in essential public services.</LD>
<LD>   The privateers have plenty of sand boxes that they can play in and
muck up to their heart's content, but essential functions, upon which
society as a whole depends, should be constitutionally off-limits to
them. That's the problem with the private sector--it can never rise
above its own self-interest.</LD>
<LD>   This notion that everyone acting exclusively to their own benefit
somehow translates into the public good is just so much hogwash, and
we have an unlimited number of examples to prove the point. We've
elevated the "marketplace" to religious dimensions and, like other
religions, image far exceeds reality, resulting in a nation with no
values that extend beyond the cash register.</LD>

<TE>   I am not a fan of Enron, its culture or business practices.
However, I see no firm basis for getting a conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Enron may be guilty of arrogance and pushing beyond the edge. The
underlying question is, did Enron and other merchant energy companies
or utilities violate any laws, rules or regulations associated with
California's flawed deregulated electric market? Or does fault rest
with the rules on which California's failed deregulation is based and
those agencies in place to implement, monitor and enforce the system?</TE>
<TE>   I see a lot of finger pointing, but no solutions other than
returning to the regulated cave we evolved from. Having been part of
a retail direct-access company at the dawn of California's
deregulation, I can safely say there were a lot of holes in the way
the California PX and ISO were set up in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, many set out to claim legitimate advantage in the
game, including some utilities themselves. So before we assign guilt,
let's be sure all suspects stand before us, including those that took
part in crafting this game in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Give us a chance to have evidence clearly presented before
judgments are made on the fate of deregulated electric markets. The
evidence may prove Enron and others guilty as charged, but the real
criminal before us is the state of California and its failure to
implement deregulation on a playing field that could work.</TE>

<TE>   For Jim Flanigan, whose praise for the efficiency of the markets

<TE>   Many of us have been saying since 1996 that energy can't be
deregulated because it's not subject to supply/demand curves any more
than is the air we breathe. Our voices were silenced by those with
more money to spend on their speech.</TE>

<HD>Sooner or Later, Early IRA Withdrawal Will Be Costly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I was laid off 18 months ago and last year rolled over my
401(k) account and my cash-balance retirement account into new,
separate IRA accounts. My cash-balance retirement account was a
pension plan funded solely by the company. If I need to access my
funds, would my cash-balance retirement fund be subject to the same
10% early-withdrawal penalty as my 401(k), or would I just pay normal
taxes on it?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The source of the money in your IRAs doesn't really
matter. It's subject to all the rules, taxes and penalties that apply
to IRAs.</LD>
<LD>   If you needed to tap that money, you would pay income taxes on
your entire withdrawal, and you might owe federal and state penalties
for early withdrawal as well. The federal penalty is 10%, and the
state penalty varies. In California, it's an additional 2.5%.</LD>
<TE>   As you can see, it would be easy to lose at least half of your
withdrawals to taxes and penalties. Once you've taken the money out,
there's no way to put it back. You will have lost those retirement
funds, and all their potential future earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Your best bet is to avoid tapping retirement funds prematurely. If
you have no other options, however, you might consider taking what's
called "substantially equal periodic payments," which will help you
avoid the early-withdrawal penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Under this system, you make regular withdrawals based on your life
expectancy. The withdrawals must continue for at least five years.</TE>
<TE>   If you haven't reached age 59 1/2 by the time the five years are
up, you have to continue taking the payments until you do. If you
want more details about how this works, check with the IRS or pick up
the book "IRAs, 401(k)s and Other Retirement Plans: Taking Your Money
Out" by Twila Slesnick and John C. Suttle (Nolo Press, 2002).</TE>
<TE>   Taxes Only Part</TE>
<TE>   of Estate Planning</TE>
<TE>   Q: In a recent column, you suggested that people see an
estate-planning attorney when their estates are big enough to incur
estate taxes. Just how big an estate would that be these days?</TE>
<TE>   A: If your net worth is approaching $1 million, it's time to make
an appointment with an estate-planning attorney. You can get
referrals to qualified estate planning specialists from your local
bar association.</TE>
<TE>   That $1 million figure isn't drawn out of thin air. It's the
current estate-tax exemption limit--the amount of money that can pass
tax-free to heirs in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The limit is scheduled to rise over the next several years until
2010, when the estate tax is scheduled to be repealed.</TE>
<TE>   But no one knows whether Congress will tinker with those limits.
The estate-tax repeal was popular, but it will be increasingly
expensive, both for the federal government and for states that shared
in the take.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands now, the repeal is scheduled to be in effect for only
one year--2010--before the tax returns in 2011. The exemption limit
in 2011 is scheduled to revert to $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   You also might want to see an estate-planning attorney if your net
worth is smaller but you expect problems, such as contentious family
members or nasty creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Careful estate planning also is a must if you have a special-needs
child or someone else who may need care or supervision for the rest
of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   And remember that estate taxes are only part of the
estate-planning equation. Depending on the state you live in, you may
want to take steps to avoid probate, the court process that follows a
death.</TE>
<TE>   California, for example, has a particularly long and expensive
probate process, which can eat up as much as 4% of your gross estate
and which typically kicks in once your assets are worth $100,000 or
more.</TE>
<TE>   Other states, including Washington and Minnesota, have much
shorter and less expensive systems, so probate avoidance is lower
priority.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you decide not to see an estate-planning attorney, you
should make sure you draw up the essential documents: a will and
durable powers of attorney for health and finances.</TE>
<TE>   The powers of attorney are documents that allow someone else to
make decisions for you if you are incapacitated, while the will
specifies how you want your money and property distributed after you
die.</TE>
<TE>   A will is particularly important if you have minor children. Don't
subject them or the rest of your family to a court fight: Name a
guardian now. Legal publisher Nolo Press offers kits, including
"Nolo's Simple Will Book" (Nolo Press, 2001), and has teamed with
personal finance software maker Intuit to produce "Quicken Lawyer
2002," software that can help you create wills, trusts and powers of
attorney.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Low interest rates may be a boon to borrowers, but they're a bust to
retirees such as Northern California resident Larry Miller.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, who has been retired for three years, has cut back on
dinners out, largely because his portfolio yields about $300 a month
less than it used to. Millions of retirees have similar complaints.</LD>
<LD>   Income-producing investments such as certificates of deposit,
money market funds and Treasury bills are paying historically low
rates of return--1% to 3% annually. After management fees, taxes and
inflation, some fixed-income investors are losing money on their
holdings. Longer-term bonds and CDs pay a bit more, but present
significantly more risk.</LD>
<TE>   And investors in search of higher income face something of a
lose-lose situation over the next several months, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   If the Federal Reserve holds fast to today's rates, yields on
relatively low-risk investments such as money market funds will
continue to languish. If the Fed decides to raise interest
rates--which many analysts think will happen this year--money market
yields will rise and bond and CD investors will get more for their
newly invested cash. But bonds and bond mutual funds they already own
probably will decline in value, because existing fixed-income
securities generally lose value when interest rates rise.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals who go into bonds need to realize that there is some
market risk involved," said Denise J. Leish, a financial planner with
Money Plans in Silver Spring, Md. "Interest rates are going to mostly
be working against you rather than for you."</TE>
<TE>   Long-Term Bonds</TE>
<TE>   Are Risky Now</TE>
<TE>   What's a fixed-income investor to do? Go short. Think munis and
agencies. And get realistic about yields.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can get [a total return of] 5% to 6% in a bond fund, you
should be very happy with that," said Mark Kiesel, executive vice
president and portfolio manager at Pimco Investments in Newport
Beach. Total return is interest income plus any price appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Possibly the most important thing investors should remember is
that it may be tempting to pick up long-term bonds because they're
yielding significantly more than short-term bonds right now, but it's
also very risky.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a recovery, so the possibility of rates going higher is
good," said Dave MacEwen, chief investment officer of fixed income at
American Century Investments in Mountain View, Calif. "I encourage
people to stick with maturities of five years or less."</TE>
<TE>   For example, the value of a 30-year Treasury bond falls about 12%
for each percentage point that market interest rates rise, Kiesel
said. Shorter-maturity securities, such as five-year Treasuries, also
get hit, but less dramatically. The five-year Treasury loses about 4%
of its value with each one-point rise in market interest rates, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   MacEwen and Kiesel believe the best investments in today's
fixed-income environment are mortgage-backed securities, or agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage-backed securities--largely forgotten in better times--are
mortgages pooled by one of several quasi-governmental agencies such
as the Government National Mortgage Assn. (Ginnie Mae), the Federal
National Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac). These organizations put together loans
with similar interest rates and maturity dates and sell them to
investors. The government guarantees the principal of the loans, so
there's no risk of default.</TE>
<TE>   However, when interest rates are falling, individuals whose home
mortgages were sold into these pools often refinance. That causes
investors to get back principal when they'd rather collect relatively
high yields on their invested cash. But if interest rates rise,
homeowners keep their lower rates--assuming they have a fixed-rate
mortgage--while investors are stuck with 30 long years of relatively
low returns.</TE>
<TE>   But in a market where interest rates probably will move modestly,
mortgage-backed securities pay fairly generous annual returns--about
6% to 6.25%--with little volatility, MacEwen said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who are in high tax brackets also should consider
municipal bonds, or munis, he said. Although the yields on munis are
modest--4% to 5%--they are exempt from federal tax. (If you buy a
muni issued by your state of residence, it's also exempt from state
income tax.) For those in the top tax brackets, that makes the
taxable equivalent yield--the amount you'd have to earn on a taxable
investment to take home the same return after tax--attractive.</TE>
<TE>   American Century's national intermediate-term muni fund yields
4.05%, which equates to a 6.6% taxable equivalent yield for someone
paying the top federal rate, MacEwen said. The company's California
intermediate-term muni-bond fund yields a little more--4.26%, which
works out to a 7.65% taxable equivalent yield for someone in the top
California income bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Kiesel also likes bonds issued by major European governments. The
interest rates are comparable to U.S. government bonds. The kicker is
that Kiesel believes currency swings in the near future probably will
work in the international investor's favor. The reason: He believes
the dollar will continue to weaken versus the euro. For Americans,
that would mean European investments would be worth more when
converted back into dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Tough to Find Good Buys in Today's Market</TE>
<TE>   But if the dollar strengthens, the currency conversion would work
against U.S. investors. And buying foreign bonds isn't easy, so
investing in them is best done through mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   Leish recommends dividend-paying stocks, figuring that investors
get income from the dividends along with possible share price
appreciation. But she acknowledges that it's getting tougher and
tougher to find good buys in today's market.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not a lot of home runs out there," Kiesel said. "This
is not going to be a home run decade for investors. You just have to
try for singles and hope you can keep a high batting average."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the worst stock bear markets, by the time they've run their course
most investors come to believe that almost nothing is safe.</LD>
<LD>   That mental adjustment may be far along for many people by now.
Certainly in the telecom sector the word "safe" has been eliminated
from the lexicon. Ditto for the electric power business. And last
week, the drug industry provided more reminders of the dangers of
making assumptions that firms with big names and long histories
automatically provide thick margins of safety for their investors</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Schering-Plough on Wednesday plummeted to their lowest
level since 1997 after the drug giant disclosed that the federal
government had launched a criminal investigation of the company's
operations.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Schering said it agreed to pay $500 million in fines
related to quality-control issues at four plants--while the criminal
probe still looms.</TE>
<TE>   Another drug firm, Abbott Labs, saw its shares fall 7.1% for the
week after it also disclosed that the government has quality-control
issues with one of its key plants.</TE>
<TE>   The drug business historically has been one that investors
considered "defensive"--in other words, in a rough economy and/or
troubled stock market, drug companies' sales and earnings could be
expected to shine through. But investors looking to bolster their
portfolio defenses over the last year have found no shelter in the
drug sector: Standard &amp; Poor's index of 13 major drug shares last
week hit a two-year low.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that there are few places to hide has been fostered in
part by the cloud of scandal that is enveloping an ever-wider swath
of corporate America. Even the most ravenous news junkies by now must
have lost track of the number of investigations state and federal
regulators have initiated in the last six months, questioning the
bullish sales and earnings results companies almost universally
posted in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Niemeier, head of accounting for the Securities and
Exchange Commission's enforcement division, last week said the agency
increasingly is focusing on accounting tricks companies used to
artificially boost revenue in the boom years, apparently to meet Wall
Street's growth expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Niemeier called revenue "the most abused line item in financial
statements," according to an interview with Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp. may be remembered as the starting point for the
national soul-searching over cooked books in the boom era, but the
ending point doesn't seem to be on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   For investors, fear of being caught with "the next Enron" has made
for very itchy trigger fingers, helping to drive major stock indexes
in early May to their lowest levels since October.</TE>
<TE>   The selling pressure finally abated last week, and most indexes
enjoyed big bounces: The Dow Jones industrials surged 4.2% to end at
10,353.08, and the Nasdaq composite, after falling in eight of the
nine previous weeks, jumped 8.8% to 1,741.39, for its biggest
one-week gain since April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But companies facing government inquiries of one type or
another--including, recently, Schering-Plough, CMS Energy and Edison
Schools--saw their stocks continue to plunge.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street refers to such issues as "falling knives"--as in, good
luck trying to catch them without seriously injuring yourself.</TE>
<TE>   The concept that risk pervades the stock market isn't new, of
course, but it was ignored by too many investors in the long bull
run. In that sense, the last two years have provided a valuable
education, albeit at heavy cost to the nest eggs of millions.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the high-profile stock collapses since 2000, and deepening
fears of more widespread corporate scandals, threaten to obscure for
many investors that there have been plenty of money-making
opportunities in equities this year.</TE>
<TE>   No stock is "safe" if an investor's definition of that term is no
risk of loss. But if you define safe in relative terms--for example,
as meaning a reasonable shot at making money in an otherwise weak
market--there is a long list of stock sectors that have qualified
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Those include defense contractors, small banks, forest products
companies, HMOs, soft-drink firms and, as James Flanigan points out
elsewhere in this section, home builders.</TE>
<TE>   And although the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is down
3.6% year to date, stocks of many small and mid-size companies have
gained ground as investors have hunted for new ideas and, perhaps,
simpler business concepts.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P's index of 600 smaller stocks is up 9.4% this year, and the
company's index of 400 mid-size stocks is up 7.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Also notable is that foreign stocks, on average, have been a good
place to be this year, as the dollar continues to sink in value
against the euro, the yen and other key currencies. That drives up
the value of foreign shares for American investors when stronger
currencies are translated into more dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The average international stock mutual fund is up 6.4% year to
date, according to Morningstar. By contrast, the average U.S. stock
fund is down 2.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who only recently have come to the conclusion that no
stock is ever really safe obviously didn't own names such as Eastman
Kodak, Gillette or Coca-Cola in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Those blue-chip giants, among others, saw their share values grind
ever lower between 1998 and 2001 as their growth rates slumped and
their franchises lost their luster.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, they provided an early warning of what would befall
the technology sector's titans--except that few tech investors
believed there could be an analogy.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who paid Kodak's peak price of about $94 in 1997 and
have held on now own a stock worth $34.83 as of Friday. If you paid
Gillette's peak price of about $60 in 1999, you're still far under
water, with the stock at $36.51 now.</TE>
<TE>   If the question is how an investor can best protect himself or
herself from incurring losses of those magnitudes, some analysts say
the answer lies in drawing a line when a stock is purchased: You tell
yourself, "If I lose a certain percentage, I'm selling, no matter
what."</TE>
<TE>   That strategy, a favorite of market "technicians" who spend much
of their time studying historical stock charts, has long been viewed
as anathema by investors who consider themselves buy-and-holders.</TE>
<TE>   If you like a stock, and it drops after you buy it, you're
supposed to buy more, the buy-and-hold strategy dictates.</TE>
<TE>   But the technology and telecom sectors in the last two years, and
former blue-chip leaders before that, have shown the perils of
refusing to deviate from buy-and-hold in the face of massive price
declines.</TE>
<TE>   For many investors, setting a limit of losing no more than 25% on
a stock would have preserved substantial capital in recent years, as
many stocks have fallen 50% or much more.</TE>
<TE>   To put it another way, the "cockroach" theory of investing, or
disinvesting, has been a brilliant strategy: If you see one ugly
problem at a company, it's a good bet that there are many others
behind the walls, waiting to emerge.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Being Probed in Two States</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia Communications Corp., the target of a U.S. accounting
probe, said it's under investigation by prosecutors in two states and
missed $45 million in interest and dividend payments due Wednesday as
the company seeks to avoid being delisted from the Nasdaq Stock
Market.</LD>
<LD>   Grand juries in the Southern District of New York and the Middle
District of Pennsylvania are investigating certain matters related to
the cable-television firm.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia is under Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny for
guaranteeing $2.3 billion in loans to partnerships run by the family
of founder John J. Rigas, who resigned last week as chairman and
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Indexes Up as Buyers Return to Wall Street</TE>
<TE>   Stocks broke a three-week losing streak as better-than-expected
retail sales and some promising profit reports from the technology
sector brought buyers back to Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 8.8%--its best weekly
performance in 13 months--as Dell Computer Corp. and Applied
Materials Inc. reported better-than-expected earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Blue-chip stocks also gained, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
rising 4.9% for its best week since September.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 4.2% as Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. rose almost 9% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Documents Spur Calls for Refunds</TE>
<TE>   More internal documents from Enron Corp. were released, giving
glimpses of conversations between traders and lawyers that California
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and others said show that Enron and others
manipulated power prices and supplies in California.</TE>
<TE>   The documents sparked renewed calls for refunds of alleged
overcharges in California and the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Enron lawyers, former and current, testified before a
Senate panel that they warned Enron its trading ploys might be
breaking the law.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood testified
that price caps might be extended in Western markets when they expire
in September.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Resources Inc. said they did nothing
illegal in the California market. But both companies conceded they
had engaged in sham trading with CMS Energy, exchanging like amounts
of energy with CMS at the same price.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner's Levin Steps Down</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. Chief Executive Gerald Levin ended his
10-year reign at the world's largest media conglomerate as many
shareholders blamed him for selling prized Time Warner assets to an
overvalued Internet giant at a fire-sale price.</TE>
<TE>   Looking gaunt and distraught at the company's annual shareholder
meeting, Levin turned over his job as chief executive to protege
Richard Parsons with a plea to investors for "faith, hope and, above
all, patience."</TE>
<TE>   Capping a decade of deal-making, Levin was heralded as the media
industry's most visionary leader in January 2000, when he oversaw the
merger of new and old media by agreeing to sell Time Warner to
America Online for stock then valued at $156 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the value of the combined company's stock has plunged
to about $84 billion as the dot-com bubble burst and AOL's Internet
growth slowed.</TE>
<TE>   Trading Scam Bilked Banks of $1 Billion</TE>
<TE>   A global metals trading scam allegedly swindled as much as $1
billion from banking giants FleetBoston Financial Corp. and J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and other financial institutions in one of the
biggest bank frauds on record.</TE>
<TE>   According to charges unsealed in a New York federal court, the
scheme allegedly cooked up by four men in New Jersey hoodwinked at
least eight banks into financing bogus metals shipments in India,
Hong Kong and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme also involved a group of banks, including General Bank,
operated by Los Angeles-based GBC Bancorp, and Torrance-based
Chinatrust (USA), a subsidiary of Taiwan's China Trust Commercial
Bank Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann to Buy Napster Assets</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann agreed to buy the assets of Napster Inc., the
pioneering Internet music-swapping service that was teetering on the
brink of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann will pay $8 million to Napster's creditors. Napster
founder Shawn Fanning, who had resigned, and former Chief Executive
Konrad Hilbers will rejoin the company. The company was expected to
file for bankruptcy protection if the Bertelsmann deal hadn't come
through.</TE>
<TE>   Sears Says It Will Buy Clothier Lands' End</TE>
<TE>   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said it's buying classic clothier Lands' End
Inc. for $1.9 billion in cash as part of efforts to boost Sears'
long-suffering apparel division.</TE>
<TE>   Lands' End will continue to offer its line of conservative and
dependable fashion, luggage and home furnishings via the Lands' End
catalogs and Web site.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Sears will begin selling select Lands' End items in
some of its 870 department stores by the holidays, with a full
roll-out by fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart to Open</TE>
<TE>   40 Supercenters</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to open 40 supercenters in California
over the next four to six years, its first foray with the giant
discount-plus-grocery stores in the state. The move is a direct
challenge to grocery chains in California.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart's quarterly earnings
jumped 20%, the most in about two years, after reining in costs,
selling more groceries and reducing inventory at its main division in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Investigating Former Kmart Execs</TE>
<TE>   The FBI is investigating Kmart Corp., joining securities
regulators examining the actions of former top executives and the
discount retailer's accounting before it sought bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The reviews were spurred by a series of anonymous letters
"expressing concern with respect to various matters," Kmart said.</TE>
<TE>   The board of Kmart, which filed the U.S. retail industry's largest
bankruptcy, also is conducting an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Court Ruling Boosts Telecom Competition</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld federal rules that allow outsiders
to lease local phone lines at relatively low cost, seemingly
supporting the effort to bring competition to the local phone market.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-1 ruling is a victory for the Federal Communications
Commission, which is seeking to spur competition, and for
long-distance providers such as AT&amp;T Corp. and WorldCom Inc., which
are eager to move into the local phone market.</TE>
<TE>   The state Public Utilities Commission reached a similar
conclusion, opening the door for long-distance companies to compete
with local phone company SBC Pacific Bell Co. by slashing the prices
SBC can charge them for access to residential customers.</TE>

<HD>Risk Ratings Aimed at Wary Investors</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Some independent research firms see
competitive edge in stressing stocks to ignore or sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hey pal, want to know a cold stock to avoid?</LD>
<LD>   In a sign of the tough times on Wall Street, some investment firms
are putting more emphasis on identifying stocks to ignore or sell
rather than pitching stocks to buy.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, the firms issuing these risk ratings on shares are
independent researchers that are playing up their distance from
traditional brokerages, which have been denounced for being
blindsided by the fall of Enron Corp. and numerous technology stocks
over the last two years.</LD>
<TE>   Florida-based Weiss Ratings Inc., which for years has issued
financial risk ratings for banks, brokerages and insurers, started a
stock-rating service in the fall, shortly before the Enron and Kmart
Corp. bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people automatically assume that big or well-known companies
are financially sound," said Martin Weiss, chairman of Weiss Ratings.
"Now that some of the big names like Enron and Kmart have fallen,
however, hopefully more investors will wake up to the need to
consider a company's true risk, using reliable, independent sources."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, discount brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. said it will
launch a computer-driven stock grading system that will give each of
3,500 issues a grade between A and F. Schwab, which historically
hasn't given investment advice, said it will recommend that clients
sell or avoid the lowest-rated shares.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab is making a play for disillusioned customers of traditional
brokerages. With the latter firms under fire for allegedly slanted
research that urges investors to buy or hold most stocks and sell
very few, independence from Wall Street now is considered a
competitive edge--even though experts caution that no stock-rating
system should be viewed as infallible.</TE>
<TE>   "There is clearly a crisis of trust among investors about what's
going on on Wall Street," Schwab co-Chief Executive David Pottruck
said Thursday at a news conference in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Big brokerages such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. are under federal and
state investigation for alleged conflicts that, critics say, have
spurred the firms' analysts to butter up even shaky companies with
glowing stock ratings in an effort to keep or win lucrative
investment banking deals.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, independent research firms such as Weiss say they
have no business ties with the companies whose shares they rate, and
thus are free to be objective. These researchers generally make money
by charging investors for their reports, whereas brokerage research
usually is free to clients.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss issues risk, performance and overall investment ratings on
7,000 stocks. Risk ratings are based on such factors as a company's
debt load and stability of cash flow; performance ratings incorporate
recent profit and share-price strength; overall investment ratings
are a combination of the risk and performance ratings--an assessment
of a stock's risk-reward trade-off.</TE>
<TE>   "By factoring in risk, our rating system is designed to correct
the deficiencies that we feel have plagued most stock ratings issued
by Wall Street brokerage firms," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   As of April 30, 21% of companies rated by Weiss had investment
grades of A (excellent) or B (good); 30% were rated C (fair); and 49%
were rated D (weak) or E (very weak).</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, "sell" ratings comprise just 2.5% to 3% of all Wall
Street brokerage stock ratings, according to data tracker Thomson
Financial/First Call. The vast majority of shares are rated "buy" or
"hold" by brokerages--which has been the case throughout the stock
market's decline of the last two years, even though brokerages say
they also factor risks into their ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Though Weiss' ratings are relatively new, they correctly
identified some of the worst-performing stocks of recent months.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 10, Weiss highlighted 13 of its lowest-rated stocks and 13
of its highest-rated rated issues.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the lowest-rated shares, including US Airways Group
Inc., JDS Uniphase Corp. and Xerox Corp., have lost an average of
33.1%, while the highest-rated stocks are up an average of 14.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 62 publicly traded companies to file for bankruptcy
protection in the first quarter, Weiss said it rated 36 of them at
least three months before their Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 filing, and
34 of those got "weak" or "very weak" investment ratings of D-plus to
E-minus.</TE>
<TE>   "The handwriting was on the wall in big bold letters, months in
advance at every one of these companies, especially the giants like
Kmart and Global Crossing," Weiss said. "And yet, major Wall Street
firms continued to maintain 'buy' or 'hold' ratings for most of their
shares, often until the bitter end."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some financial advisors note that because Weiss' stock
ratings have a short track record, investors should be careful about
judging their success.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy Debt Loads Can Trigger Low Ratings</TE>
<TE>   Mike Nozzarella, a financial planner at Tarbox Equity in Newport
Beach, said all stock research must be taken with a grain of salt.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies get low safety ratings from various independent
research services because of heavy debt loads, even though the firms'
cash flows may be strong enough to service the debts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nozzarella's firm might use shares of wireless telecom firm Nextel
Communications Inc. in "aggressive" client portfolios, he said, even
though the stock gets low safety ratings from Weiss and from Value
Line Investment Survey, another independent researcher.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Nozzarella and other advisors say independent stock
research provides needed balance for Wall Street's unrelenting
bullishness on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Value Line, best known for its "timeliness" ratings on stocks, and
Standard &amp; Poor's, which along with credit ratings issues stock
ratings for individual investors, are among the most respected
independent firms with long records, financial advisors say. Both
have beaten the market over the long haul with their top-rated
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Investment services such as MSN Money and mutual fund tracker
Morningstar Inc. have gotten into the stock-rating game more
recently.</TE>
<TE>   MSN Money, Microsoft Corp.'s financial site, launched free stock
ratings last June under the name StockScouter. Like Value Line's
ratings, StockScouter's ratings are based on a quantitative, or
number-crunching, evaluation model that weighs specific hard data on
companies and stocks, instead of relying on an analyst's subjective
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar's ratings, by contrast, are partly determined by
analysts' subjective views. Chicago-based Morningstar began issuing
stock ratings in August, said Pat Dorsey, director of stock analysis.
Ratings and analyst reports are a service for the firm's fee-paying
"premium" Web site users, but highlights are posted on the site's
free area.</TE>
<TE>   Some money managers who pen investment newsletters also have been
getting into the game of emphasizing lists of stocks to sell rather
than to buy, playing the Enron card.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Navellier, a fund manager based in Incline Village, Nev.,
warned in a recent e-mail to prospective clients that "there are tons
of companies still bleeding red ink. And scattered through that list
are the next Enrons, the next Global Crossings--companies that will
break your heart and bust your wallet."</TE>
<TE>   In a report, Navellier targets "99 Stocks You Must Sell Now,"
including many big names</TE>
<TE>   Pitching his Technology Investing newsletter, money manager
Michael Murphy of Half Moon Bay, Calif., invites recipients of a
recent e-mail to view a free report unmasking three tech stocks to
sell immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy says he has followed the tech industry for 30 years. "I've
even been known to take new devices apart just to see how they work,"
he boasts in the report.</TE>
<TE>   But some critics and competitors have picked apart his record as a
fund manager. The Monterey Murphy New World Core Technology mutual
fund is down an annualized 9% over the last five years, according to
Morningstar, and the Monterey Murphy New World Technology fund has
lost an annualized 19% in the period.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, financial advisors say, is that investors should
be just as careful with recommendations to sell stocks as they are
with recommendations to buy.</TE>

<LD>Here's a look at some of the stock-rating services offered by firms
that say their research is free of conflicts that dog major Wall
Street brokerages:</LD>
<LD>   Charles Schwab Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Product: Schwab Equity ratings, A-through-F grades for the 3,500
largest U.S. stocks, updated weekly.</LD>
<TE>   How it works: Stocks are rated based on a computer-driven
"quantitative" formula that grades on a so-called bell curve. The top
10% of stocks get A ratings, the next 20% get B ratings, the middle
40% are rated C, the next 20% get D and the next 10% get F.</TE>
<TE>   The formula includes fundamental measures such as a company's
return on invested capital; stock valuation measures such as free
cash flow per share; momentum measures such as earnings growth; and
risk measures such as the stability of sales growth.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: Free to Schwab customers</TE>
<TE>   Contact: www.schwab.com, or (800) 435-4000</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Product: Stock "star" ratings on about 500 major companies, with
more being added gradually.</TE>
<TE>   How it works: Unlike the firm's better-known star ratings for
mutual funds, which are based on past performance, Morningstar's
stock ratings attempt to gauge future prospects for shares.</TE>
<TE>   Ranging from five stars (best) to one star (worst), the ratings
are based on a "value" approach to investing: They compare a stock's
current price with Morningstar analysts' estimate of the issue's fair
price. Stocks trading at 30% or more below the supposed fair price
get five stars; those believed to be 10% to 30% undervalued get four
stars, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks also are rated separately for risk (low, medium or high)
based on the company's debt load, the consistency of its cash flow
and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: Premium Morningstar Web site membership, including access to
all ratings, is $109 a year; some ratings are on the free area of the
Web site.</TE>

<TE>   MSN Money</TE>
<TE>   Product: StockScouter service, which rates about 5,700 stocks from
"strong" to "poor" on a 10-point scale (10 is best), using a
quantitative formula.</TE>
<TE>   How it works: Stocks are rated daily based on their risk/reward
outlook for the next six months. The system measures expected risk by
looking at share price volatility over the last 12 months, and it
measures expected return by looking at earnings growth and projected
growth; insider buying and selling; price-to-earnings ratios; and
recent share price trends.</TE>

<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's</TE>
<TE>   Product: S&amp;P's weekly investing newsletter, the Outlook,
highlights the firm's new and revised "star" rankings on the 1,100
stocks covered by the firm's analysts. Ratings range from five stars
(best) to one star (worst), and seek to predict a stock's prospects
for the next six to 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   How it works: Sales and earnings trends, debt levels and stock
valuation measures such as price-to-earnings ratios are among the
factors S&amp;P analysts consider when assigning star rankings.</TE>
<TE>   The newsletter also highlights various screens, including
five-star stocks with high "quality" rankings. Though not safety
ratings per se, these separate quality rankings, which range from
A-plus to D, measure factors such as the growth and stability of a
company's earnings and dividends over the last 10 years. Firms with
high quality rankings are considered by S&amp;P to be the most solid.</TE>

<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's</TE>
<TE>   Product: The weekly Value Line Investment Survey, the company's
flagship publication, covers and rates 1,700 stocks. Each stock
report is updated quarterly, on a staggered basis.</TE>
<TE>   How it works: Value Line is best known for its "timeliness"
rankings, which rate stocks from 1 (best) to 5 (worst) based on
expected appreciation over the next six to 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings estimate revisions and valuation measures such as
price-to-earnings ratios are among the factors that go into
timeliness rankings, which are based purely on a mathematical formula
(i.e., analysts' personal views aren't a factor). At any time, the
100 stocks ranked highest by the Value Line system are rated 1 for
timeliness.</TE>
<TE>   Value Line also issues "technical" rankings based on a stock's
recent price strength and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   One method for narrowing investment ideas, according to Value
Line, is to look for stocks with both timeliness and technical
rankings of 1.</TE>
<TE>   Value Line also publishes separate "safety" rankings for each
stock--an assessment of a company's financial health and share price
volatility.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $598 a year for the main survey. The small- and mid-cap
stock edition, covering 1,800 additional companies, is $249 a year.</TE>

<TE>   Product: Weiss Investment Ratings, updated monthly, weigh the
prospects of roughly 7,000 common stocks based on their risk/reward
trade-off.</TE>
<TE>   How it works: The overall ratings, from A-plus (highest) to

measure that gauges a company's debt level, stability of earnings and
other factors, and a performance measure that gauges cash flow
growth, recent stock price strength and other factors.</TE>

<HD>Racing to Make It to Head of the Class</HD>
<DH>There's no proof that a prestigious education leads to
success in life, but that doesn't stop students from applying</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HILL</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High school seniors across the nation have just concluded a
hard-fought contest--the college entrance race. For many, victory is
acceptance into a college high on the prestige list, a hierarchy
established by peers and parents, by U.S. News and World Report's
rankings of top schools, by high school and other counselors eager to
add a few Ivy League acceptances to their records. Defeat is a
mailbox of rejection letters, a forced march to a lower-ranked, less
prestigious school.</LD>
<LD>   But what exactly is such a victory worth? What is the cost of
defeat? It's hard to say that this contest has any meaning. There are
no studies--academic or anecdotal--that indicate a correlation
between the ranking or prestige of an undergraduate college and
success in life, whether measured in financial, emotional or
spiritual terms.</LD>
<LD>   In some ways, the focus on the few top schools seems a throwback
to an earlier age when major institutions of the country were all on
the East Coast and in the hands of a properly credentialed elite.</LD>
<TE>   That is certainly no longer the case. And yet, every year tens of
thousands of high school seniors clamor for the precious spaces in
the schools deemed to be at the top of the heap.</TE>
<TE>   Morton O. Schapiro, an economist who studies higher education and
is president of Williams College, a top-of-the-heap school, says that
the top students in the country are going to a smaller and smaller
number of schools.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent book on financial aid, Schapiro and co-author Michael
S. McPherson, president of Macalester College in Minnesota, noted
that the bulk of National Merit semifinalists who attended 150
colleges 20 years ago now are concentrated in 40 colleges.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a lot of other product markets; there's a great
interest in perceived quality," Schapiro says. "BMW is doing well,
but Oldsmobile goes out of business. Ritz-Carlton is fine, but Howard
Johnson is bankrupt. There's a flight toward perceived quality."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason, he says, is that the marketplace is national.
In decades past, the prestige college game was played mainly among
prep schools in the Northeast. Other students tended to stay closer
to home, supporting their local schools. Now the whole country gets
involved. "There's a lot of hype involved," says Martha O'Connell,
dean of admissions at Western Maryland College. "It's not unlike the
way Americans approach anything; they clamor to go toward the brand
names people recognize. It's not the most positive thing for higher
education. Students are choosing schools that might not be the best
fit for them so their parents can drop its name at a cocktail party.
That's not the way to choose colleges."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman A. Hrabowski Jr., who knows that the school where he is
president--the University of Maryland, Baltimore County--probably
never will rank in the U.S. News and World Report's top 10 list, says
students and their parents should be focusing on outcomes: What does
your degree get you and at what cost?</TE>
<TE>   Hrabowski contends that many top high school students get crushed
in the highly competitive atmosphere of prestige schools and never
reach their potential.</TE>
<TE>   He can point to the fact that almost all students who accept
UMBC's Meyerhoff scholarships remain in their science-oriented majors
while only half of those who turn down the scholarship--usually for a
bigger-name school--stay in those difficult fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents need to look at the philosophy the institutions have
about undergraduate education," Hrabowski says. "Some places say, 'We
don't spoon-feed kids.' They make it very clear you are on your own,
that it's prestigious to be here, you are smart, you should be able
to make it on your own. Our experience is that smarter students lead
more complicated lives, and so face more challenges. Many students
need special support, especially in the freshman year."</TE>
<TE>   Better, he argues, to go to a smaller, nurturing liberal arts
college, and worry about the prestige name for graduate school.</TE>
<TE>   "People get focused on going to the biggest name regardless of
whether the institution meets the needs of that child," Hrabowski
says. "What we are doing is showing where students go when they leave
here--Duke, Stanford, Oxford, Harvard."</TE>
<TE>   David W. Breneman, dean of the school of education at the
University of Virginia, says Hrabowski has a point. "Unless you are
totally self-directed at 17 or 18 years of age, know exactly what you
want and are very aggressive, you can get lost," he says of some of
the large prestigious research universities. Maynard Mack, who heads
the honors program at the University of Maryland, College Park, says
that when he was in the English department at Harvard University, he
read all of the applications for graduate school.</TE>
<TE>   "There were about 600 of them, and we would accept 30," he says.
"Every year, 10 of those, a third, would be from schools you had
never heard of. I'm not talking about the University of Maryland, I'm
talking about schools you had to look up in the almanac to find out
where they were."</TE>
<TE>   But Ira Berlin, who has spent most of his career as a historian at
the University of Maryland, College Park, says there might be
something to the prestige game.</TE>
<TE>   "What people are buying for their sons and daughters is a cohort
population from whom they will learn and they will grow," Berlin
says. "I mean, Al Gore's roommate at Harvard was the actor Tommy Lee
Jones. In some ways, that's not accidental. These are bright,
ambitious people who in some ways feel themselves anointed to do
great things, having convinced themselves it is appropriate for them
to do great things, so they end up going out and doing great things."</TE>
<TE>   But Berlin says that if a place such as Maryland can attract such
a cohort with its honors program--which he helped spruce up while a
dean--then it has an advantage over an expensive private college.</TE>
<TE>   Still, all agree that one of the strengths of U.S. higher
education is that there is such a wide range of schools for all sorts
of students, unlike most of the rest of the world where your fate is
sealed by an examination taken at age 16 that decides your
educational track.</TE>
<TE>   Breneman fears that the focus on a few top schools drives America
in the direction of other countries. "I think it's better for the
country when the bright kids are spread out," he says. "This has all
the earmarks of a stratifying class system. What's very clear to me
is that people who go to all kinds of places do very well and plenty
of Harvard graduates have not succeeded."</TE>

<HD>Thanks to Her, Be Cool Without Breaking a Sweat</HD>
<DH>Dany Levy's Daily Candy site aims to do here as it did for
N.Y.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dany Levy sits in the Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf at Beverly and Robertson
clutching her New York Times as a badge of identity. She flashes her
newsprint accessory and telegraphs her East Coast otherness to a sea
of airheaded Angelenos blissfully gulping down their nonfat, decaf
iced-blendeds.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time I've read the paper since I've been out
here," she confesses.</LD>
<LD>   Green-eyed, ambitious, fast-talking and refreshingly high-strung,
Levy, 29, is the founder of www.dailycandy.com, a Web site that sends
free daily e-mail tips on everything from beauty products to
restaurants and fashion finds. It is, in short, a guide on how to be
hip. Daily Candy would never say that, of course. That would not be
very Manhattan, where irony and self-deprecation still rule. "We are
careful never to call it a style guide, or cool guide, or a hip
guide," Levy says. "To say it would be to discredit it."</LD>
<TE>   Dressed in a tiny black tank, even tinier low-rise jeans and
pointy black shoes with heels a girl can actually walk in, the
diminutive Levy does not come across as the out-of-place New Yorker
she seems to think she is. But in case you missed the point, did she
mention that she is a New Yorker and that she feels very pale,
uncomfortable and foreign here?</TE>
<TE>   That fact, however, has not prevented Levy, her New York-based
skeleton staff of five, a part-time Los Angeles staff of two and a
stable of freelancers on both coasts from launching a Los Angeles
version of their Web site. Daily Candy Los Angeles debuted in
December. Levy flew out this month for an official launch party at
Drake's, a sure-to-be-cool club in Venice that isn't even open yet.
Like its New York counterpart, Daily Candy Los Angeles aspires to
suss out the newest restaurants, the quirkiest services and the
hottest new trends, and write them up with authority and sass. The
goal is to reach urbanites who are short on time and want to be in
the know.</TE>
<TE>   The writing style is smart, irreverent and breezy. ("That sweet
little doggie is starting to out-style you," begins a pet-focused
fashion item. "So he's bored with his Burberry sweater. Is finicky
Fido Finkelstein ready for Passover?") While items promote products
and places, Levy insists that her site is editorially pure. If Daily
Candy doesn't like it, she says, the staff won't write about it.
Levy, former editor of New York magazine's Sales and Bargains section
and creator of that weekly's GothamStyle section, forbids staffers to
accept a gift worth more than $50. The daily e-mails are formatted in
digestible bite-size chunks with a lot of zing.</TE>
<TE>   Daily Candy has become popular in New York among the "Sex and the
City" demographic of young women who apparently have more disposable
income than they know what to do with. (Levy claims that 30% of
subscribers earn more than $100,000 a year.) Since it was launched in
2000, Daily Candy has amassed 90,000 subscribers, she said, with new
ones signing up at a rate of 300 to 400 a day. Five months after she
created an L.A. version, she has 12,000 subscribers here.</TE>
<TE>   Levy's small network of cool hunters is constantly working the
city. Correspondent Sally Horchow, 32, a freelance journalist and
shoe freak, spotted some cool sneakers and followed them. Eventually,
her obsession led her to a shoe collector, whose home is filled with
rare Nikes and faux snakeskin Adidas. Horchow wrote an item the day
his Web site, www.shoehypes.com, launched. He sold out in a day.
Other items have included where to get the best, most fun manicures
(Robert Bachelor Salon in Toluca Lake, where beauticians affix
swatches of vintage scarves to your big toes; Lanny's Nails on 3rd
Street, where pedicures cost only $9); where to find cool corduroys
(Marc Vachon on Melrose Avenue) or to get a yarmulke and tallis for
your dog (the Woofery in Century City.)</TE>
<TE>   Daily Candy may seem like the realm of flighty, style-obsessed
chicks, but big corporations are starting to take heed because, as
Levy points out, the site "moves product." The day Daily Candy wrote
a feature on "Sam the Cat and Other Stories," by Matthew Klam, the
book shot from No. 10,000 to No. 38 on the Amazon.com bestseller
list. Two Barnes &amp; Nobles in Manhattan sold out by lunchtime that
day, according to a spokesman for Random House, Klam's publisher.</TE>
<TE>   Daily Candy has caught the attention of some big-time Arbiters of
Cool. Levy recently met with Ian Schrager to discuss penning the
in-room guides for his clubby luxury hotels. According to Levy, the
New York site became profitable a year and a half after it launched,
by charging for ads and sponsored links.</TE>
<TE>   Given her site's exuberance, perhaps the most striking thing about
meeting Levy is to find out that she hates L.A..</TE>
<TE>   She's tried to like it. Really. She even wrote a piece for Elle
magazine about her failed attempt to "loosen up and love L.A." During
a week in January she bleached her mousy hair blond. She bronzed
herself at a tanning salon. She got a feng-shui pedicure and got her
toes painted Far East fuchsia. She dutifully got a bikini wax and
flashed some backside cleavage L.A. style. She even went to Utta,
whom she described as the "infamous Hollywood fat pincher." (Daily
Candy had an item on Utta's Body Sculpture in Beverly Hills, where
Utta is said to knead away cellulite at the rate of $150 an hour.)
But, as Levy wrote in Elle: "Put simply, Los Angeles and I don't get
along. I'm a New Yorker. A die-hard one."</TE>
<TE>   So why bother writing an insider's guide to Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   New York and Los Angeles, she explains, are "aspirational cities"
or "style hubs." For all its superficiality, sigh, Los Angeles simply
can't be ignored. Levy said she is still trying to figure out Los
Angeles. "In New York, items on restaurants go through the roof," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, it seems like people could care less about restaurants."</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos seem to be much more responsive to quirky and unusual
services, such as Doody Dude, who scoops up dog feces. "They love
services in New York, too, but here it is more of a status thing to
enlist a staff of people to do various things," said Horchow.</TE>
<TE>   And there have been some miscalculations, based on preconceived
notions of this city's star-worshiping tendencies.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought people would be more susceptible to celebrity
name-dropping, like so and so carries this bag ... but that is not
necessarily true," Levy says.</TE>
<TE>   Ava Scanlan, 26, is a Daily Candy devotee who moved from New York
to Los Angeles. She said Daily Candy serves as a virtual network of
girlfriends in the know, something she doesn't have here yet.</TE>
<TE>   But the similarities between the two cities are undeniable she
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear to God," she said, "there is a tunnel that runs between
L.A. and New York and bypasses the rest of America."</TE>

<LD>"Hopscotch, the Tiny Bunny"</LD>
<LD>   by Stephanie Calmenson</LD>
<LD>   Hopscotch is a tiny bunny. He has 10 brothers and sisters. One day
the little bunnies were playing hide-and-go-seek and they went off
without him. The next day when he woke up, he saw a giant cat.
Someone said, "Hurry, follow my voice." It turned out to be a field
mouse, and they became friends because they were just the same size.
They played everything together until they started to miss their
families. At the end, the mouse and bunny families try to find them.

<TE>   This book has lots of silly tales in it. For example, there is a
boy who loves to draw doodles. One day while he is inside the
classroom, his doodles come off of the paper and offer to do his
schoolwork. He is surprised at first, but he accepts the doodles'
help. But they start doing tomorrow's work, too, and he can't stop
them, so he erases the doodles. It is a really funny book. I bet you

<HD>A Journey and a Mind Trip</HD>
<DH>Two Angelenos take contrasting walks down corridors of
'Memory' exhibit</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our memories are relief maps of our interiors, tracing where we've
been, suggesting possibilities. The mundane route to work or a new
acquaintance's name merges with the treasured: the image of a
childhood home, the rasp of an old friend's chuckle. And lost worlds
may suddenly reappear, invoked by a sensory trigger: the feel of the
stitches on a baseball. The scent of star jasmine. A song from some
distant summer spinning out from the dashboard radio. The taste of a
madeleine.</LD>
<LD>   "Memory," an exhibit currently on view at the California Science
Center in Exposition Park, traverses this world with a wild,
circuitous journey through the theater of the mind and the brain.
Developed at San Francisco's Explor- atorium by a team of curators
led by Michael Pearce, the show is a collection of cross-discipline
work: video and fine artists alongside neuroscientists and other
brain experts exhibiting their research findings. Through a battery
of interactive installations that consider the psychological,
biological and cultural aspects of memory, the show illustrates the
intricate process we describe compactly as "trying to remember."</LD>
<TE>   Memory's dimensions, it becomes clear, go beyond what we remember
to encompass how we remember, whether in small bits or wide swaths.
The act of remembering, unique as the person within whom it resides,
depends not only on ephemeral factors like personality and experience
but also the physical repository that holds them, the network of
nerves and chemicals that work to store all manner of impulse and
detail.</TE>
<TE>   Two Angelenos whose work brings them in contact daily with these
two poles of memory agreed to walk through the corridors of "Memory,"
each revealing a distinct way of understanding the process. For
Bernard Cooper, a memoirist and the art critic for Los Angeles
magazine, the visit is a journey into the essential stuff of writing.
And Keith L. Black, director of neurosurgery at the Maxine Dunitz
Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, selected as
one of Time magazine's "Heroes of Medicine," travels through our
biological coding, sorting through the goo and the two-dollar words
to find the spiritual dimension at its core.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   `Recollection is part fact, part embroidery'</TE>
<TE>   The ersatz vanity table set with a cluster of plastic apothecary
bottles filled with Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Powder or Vicks VapoRub
holds little appeal for Bernard Cooper. Nor do the reverberating bass
lines or guitar licks from many seasons past hurtling from a jukebox.</TE>
<TE>   What makes him pause is a TV screen.</TE>
<TE>   There he lingers, staring at flashing images of Hollywood icons.
They tumble past in luminous black and white or hyper-real
Technicolor: A flash of Hepburn. A glance of Bogart. There's a reedy
Robert De Niro, interrogating his reflection. In galloping succession
past dusty western towns, dancing girls, cops and robbers, UFOs.</TE>
<TE>   "Precious Images," a dreamy film loop assembled by director Chuck
Workman, is one of the lead-off installations in "Memory," and it has
caught Cooper by surprise. "Those images remind me that when I sit
down to write, even a brief remembered image can lead to a whole
story. Whole narratives can unfold from extremely concise visual
recollections."</TE>
<TE>   It might be a downcast smile, the shadow moving across a face. He
doesn't know what brief flash or magnified mini-detail might trigger
his reflex to burrow in, to settle inside a memory.</TE>
<TE>   Images have long been Cooper's catalysts, the road leading
backward into a vast store of memories. And this installation, with
its flashy collage set in motion and its provocative prompts--"an
image that lasts less than a second can evoke strong memories. Watch
what happens to your memory when you see a large number of film
images in rapid succession ..."--is designed to do just that: uncover
the deeper associations tied to images--when and how they got there,
why they stick.</TE>
<TE>   As "Memory" evocatively illustrates, sight, like each of the
senses--smell, taste, hearing, touch--serves as a memory trigger.
Each sense has the power to open a long-stuck door or suddenly
excavate a piece of personal history, making it as vivid as a chance
meeting with an old friend.</TE>
<TE>   The visual, in particular, might strike Cooper because he has a
background in the arts--or, as the exhibit suggests, his
preoccupation with visuals might point to why he chose those life
paths to begin with. The author of "Guess Again," (Simon &amp; Schuster,
2000), a collection of stories, and "Truth Serum" (Houghton Mifflin,
1996), a memoir in essays as meticulous and luminous as tiny
paintings, is not only tuned to the shadings of written narratives,
he's also studied visual arts and architecture, earning a master's in
fine art from California Institute of the Arts in 1979. Images stick,
evolving into doors that open to the future and the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it's an image you can locate in time," he says. "I can
remember once as a kid my father and my mother got into an argument
and they were about to leave on vacation and [my father] threw his
suitcase up into the air and it opened. And all of the clothes
drifted down all over the driveway and in front of the house. The
image is so provocative. To explore it really allowed me to explore
all the conflicts with my parents and the way my father expressed
frustration, but it was all locked into that image."</TE>
<TE>   He glides quickly past installations that urge visitors to explore
aspects of remembering like mnemonics and memory's other clever
shortcuts. He stops briefly before a laminated board that describes
ways to sharpen memory using clustering devices such as "chunking" to
help recall a string of unconnected letters, so that "IBMCIAFBIATT"
becomes IBM, CIA, FBI, ATT.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I don't think so!" Cooper says, his bellow suddenly blooming
into big a laugh. Similarly, he doesn't linger with the kitschy
"Jukebox Memories" installation that belts out pop-song hooks grouped
by decade. And the trio of fancy Punch and Judy-style puppet boxes
"Touch Theater" that test tactile recall makes him anxious.</TE>
<TE>   His twists and turns, fascinations and fears, support the theory
that we tend to navigate the past using familiar and comfortable
sensory pathways. In fact, what Diane Perlov, deputy director of
exhibitions at the Science Center, has noted, is that memory itself
helps make determinations about what installations visitors find
themselves drawn to or avoiding. Within the exhibit, which is
designed to make people more aware of science and the unique
characteristics of memory, "people are guided by their preferences,
their memories of past experience."</TE>
<TE>   "Wide-Angle Memory" restores Cooper to more comfortable territory,
appealing to his visual sensibilities and the pleasure he takes in
arranging and rearranging pieces. He studies an image, a grainy,
washed-out still of garbage cans in an alley. From memory, he now
must sketch what he thinks he saw, using an old-fashioned black slate
and a sliver of chalk. He draws: A row of cans. A picket fence. A
crumpled paper-wad. His rendering looks as if he had stepped back
five or six steps from the scene in the photo. He's even tidied up
the alley, moving a lid from the ground to the top of the can.</TE>
<TE>   From an explanatory card, he reads: "Our brain makes sense of
partial information by filling in the gaps." On goes the lightbulb:
"You have to stand back and look at what happened. You start from
being inside of a memory, but eventually you stand back and look at
it from outside--or farther away--to make sense of it. This is what I
do. This is what a memoirist does!"</TE>
<TE>   The nature of his own memory becomes clear to him as he considers
what he's drawn to among the exhibits. "When Flannery O'Connor was
asked what was the most important sense for a writer, she said it was
the sense of sight ... because you have to be able to see what's
happening in your head if you ever hope to get it down on paper,"
says Cooper. "The trigger is visual, but the expression is
verbal....I trust my memory not because it is accurate or
extraordinary--because I've always assumed that recollection is part
fact and part embroidery. I take for granted that there will be a
certain amount of fabrication ... I try to be careful ... not to
portray myself in a better light or to blame somebody. [It's] all
about trying to get closer to truth." What disturbs him are a pair of
explicit videos that examine the fragility of memory, its dependence
on the body: The first is a mini docu-journal of a San
Francisco-based artist, Paul Kwan, whose memory is scrubbed away
after a stroke. Cooper races by with barely a glace: "I'm really
afraid of anything that is about losing memory," he says. "My fear of
course is that I would be ... I would be a shell. In the best-case
scenario I would be just like my dog. Just going moment to moment,
wagging my tail. "</TE>
<TE>   He's made equally queasy by a different clip depicting an earnest
Berkeley-based neuroscientist, Robert T. Knight, carving into a brain
as if it's a Christmas turkey and pointing out its various regions
and their functions in the memory process. "It makes me feel my brain
in a way that I really don't want to," Cooper says. "I want to live
from the brain out. I don't like to think of the physical component.
And maybe that's the memoirist point of view--but [memory] seems a
sort of transcendent thing. Not sort of rooted to something as
mundane as an organ in your skull."</TE>
<TE>   He's more interested in the way we make meaning of remembered
events, fitting the incomprehensible into our personal and collective
narratives. He pauses before the last television set in "Memory,"
absorbed yet again with familiar images--the Space Shuttle crash, the
fall of the Berlin Wall-- and finding them to be slightly altered
reflections of those that settled somewhere deep inside him long ago.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things I do habitually," says Cooper, "is if something
strange or inexplicable happens, I tell the story over and over and
over ... until I get it right. Or it makes sense." The facts alone,
he's learned, don't really get at the essence of history. "The kind
of 'this happened, that happened' narrative is totally boring," says
Cooper. It's the incidental details--a door the color of lime
sherbet, a whiff of Palmolive soap--that dress it up, give it context
and set a memory in motion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   `The brain is like an airplane engine'</TE>
<TE>   The brain, that "organ in your skull," is Keith L. Black's domain.</TE>
<TE>   He's a Los Angeles-based neurosurgeon who pioneered groundbreaking
research, designing ways to open the barrier between blood and brain,
and thus enable chemotherapeutic drugs to be delivered directly into
a tumor. Black saunters through the nooks and crannies of "Memory" as
if touring familiar grounds. In somber suit and soft oxfords, he
moves thoughtfully from installation to installation, pausing long
enough to take mental snapshots and connect the mind-body dots.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering and forgetting, this basic propelling device of life,
says Black, is key to our very existence. "Memory is basically a
survival instinct, the reason that the body or the brain does
anything at all," he says. He nods toward the exhibit "Smell and
Emotions," which offers visitors a chance to revisit various
evocative scents. "It really brings out why you remember more--and
the memory becomes more colorful--with smell." Smell helps seal an
event, he says, because it's threaded back to basic wiring and
impulses. "Most animals have well-developed olfactory lobes and
depend on smell for activities--hunting, sexual drives, emotional
limbic system. Since that part of the brain is more developed, in
animals the sense of smell takes on a significance in helping to
avoid predators--for survival .... If you can smell a predator or a
potential prey, then obviously that gives you an advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Cooper, Black, impressed, lingers at the video of Dr.
Knight's brain dissection. "The brain is like an airplane engine," he
explains. "It's redundant. You have to get an injury on both sides of
the hippocampus to lose your short-term memory ... your ability to
form new memories." He's intrigued by film of the stroke patient's
quest to reassemble his memory, and consequently his identity. He
looks intently at a through-the-microscope video display of wriggling
dendrites and nerves firing and connecting, reading them as if they
were captions on a page.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the museum's Perlov has found that people navigate toward
interactive exhibits that bring memory back in a rush. "People
gravitate toward the exhibits that test their own memories--or their
friends' or families'." They compare and contrast versions of
stories; they test their own perceived limits or are surprised at
what lies just beneath the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Where Cooper sees memory as a vehicle that carries him toward
characters (and ultimately himself), Black sees the brain itself as a
character. And his deep fascination is with the stories of how memory
is created, rather than the stories memory can create.</TE>
<TE>   Many factors, says Black, determine why we slough off some
memories or give one memory more significance than another. "If you
had something that happened when you were 5, and you remember it,
it's probably because it is associated with a significant event.
Either you got hit by a car or burned on a stove. That's a pretty
traumatic event. The brain [first] says, 'Let me remember that' and
makes that first filter. It stores it in short-term memory."</TE>
<TE>   Trauma is experienced in the body as a "bilateral event," with
both sides of the brain working in tandem, says Black. As a survival
mechanism, those events "are associated with a high priority, and are
more likely to be laid down as a noxious event in the future."</TE>
<TE>   But it takes another step to put the event in deep storage.
"Short-term memory ... is essentially a chemical event. There are
chemical changes that occur in the brain that will last for minutes,
hours or days. Then the brain has to have a second filter. So, it
processes the information in short-term memory, then it says this
particular short-term memory is important--someone gave you a million
dollars, you got burned on the stove--let me put it in long-term
memory. Then it becomes hard-wired. The actual cells make new
connections to store that memory--it's very similar to the computer.
You have your hard drive and then your other memory space, which is
not your hard drive, which you can basically 'dump and resolve.'"</TE>
<TE>   Essentially, the brain is a memoirist, as Black describes it,
choosing details, highlighting or striking, and ultimately
determining what will best move us forward in our personal life
stories. "If you imagine all of the things the brain must do when you
walk into a room, every little detail it records: the lights, where
every stool is, every sound--you don't want to remember all of that
stuff. The brain wants to dump it out. The brain wants to decide what
is important for me to learn to enhance my survival. So, in the
stroke patient [video], for example, what the brain remembered was
that he had some of his childhood food--Chinese food--which is what
he liked in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Sunk deep in long-term memory, says Black, "the brain said: 'Oh. I
remember this. This must be important. Let me start paying
attention.' And the more attention it pays, the more it begins to
stimulate the process of laying down new memories."</TE>
<TE>   There are reasons, he explains, that some memories stand out in
sharp relief from others, or that an event witnessed by many might be
remembered and interpreted in just as many ways. "It's illustrated in
the drawing exercises around the exhibit. Unless the event is truly
significant, you will only remember a portion of the details," and
the brain, as Cooper learned, makes accommodations, filling in the
gaps with imagination. The same goes for family disputes over who was
wearing what and who said what to whom: "Let's say you remember 60%
of the detail. And everyone is going to remember a different percent
of that 60%."</TE>
<TE>   The metamorphosis of the story into "Rashomon" begins as each
participant's brain makes allowances and tweaks for what it does and
doesn't know. "Everything gets either amplified or downplayed," says
Black. "And then the events change. You change a word and someone
extrapolates something else .... " like the best of fiction.</TE>
<TE>   And like the best of fiction, these stories become embedded,
passed along. Memory genes, says Black, are shared and transmitted.
"The best example," says Black, "are birds who can migrate thousands
of miles when they are born and remember without having seen that
pathway before. Or remember a mating song without ever having heard
it before. So the genes are basically code for certain programs and
connections in the brain."</TE>
<TE>   In humans, built-in memory goes beyond coded primal instincts:
fears--arachnophobia, say--or survival skills such as homing in on
prey. It may have a spiritual sense as well, Black suggests. "If you
think back, in essence, theoretically all of us could have a
pre-programmed memory of the origin of life," he says. "And if you
look at the writings of all the different religions, no matter what
it is--Christianity, Buddhism--it all has common themes. One
possibility, an explanation for those common themes, is that we all
have a certain sort of genetic program--whoever our creator was and
whatever the origin of life was."</TE>
<TE>   That might begin to explain a memoirist's reverence for stories
sprung from the past by unexpected triggers, the stories of our own
beginnings.</TE>
<TE>   At an exhibit consisting of a night stand set simply with a lamp
and open journal, Cooper pauses to read visitors' recollections of
their earliest memories: " ... When I would put food in my diaper."
"Getting sick in the car on the way to California ...." "Counting in
Italian."</TE>
<TE>   He gazes at the penciled entries, common, yet almost too intimate,
then gently shuts the book.</TE>

<LD>We hadn't looked at them for years, these grainy videotapes of my
daughters' early years. But last week--on the day the eldest of my
three daughters turned 17--we all wound up on the couch in front of
the TV, watching chronicles of the girls they used to be.</LD>
<LD>   On the screen was another birthday celebration. Their dad was
wielding the video camera as I frosted a homemade cake, amid the
chaos that was our life in those days. The baby was propped up in a
walker, wailing at her lack of mobility. The 2-year-old kept climbing
onto the counter, knocking over cups and smearing her face with
frosting.</LD>
<LD>   And the 6-year-old birthday girl was singing to herself while
counting out the candles for her cake. "Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen."
She giggled. "Seventeen, Mommy." She beamed into the camera, with a
snaggle-toothed smile and shining brown eyes. "Today's my birthday
and I'm 17."</LD>
<TE>   I grunted, barely acknowledging her attempt at humor. I was too
busy scooping her little sister from the counter and trying to quiet
the baby with a few crumbs of cake.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 11 years later, as I watch the small girl on the screen
giggle at the idea of being 17, the joke seems to be on me.</TE>
<TE>   It's an oft-told tale in our family, the way their Dad was always
hauling out the video camera, preserving us for posterity. There
didn't have to be a special occasion. He'd sit for hours--one eye
pressed to the viewfinder, the other on a basketball game on
TV--recording his family's daily routine.</TE>
<TE>   There's Alyssa, twirling around in a tutu, Danielle leaping from
the couch to the table, Brittany trying to pull herself up on a
chair. There are tricycle spills and sisterly spats and diaper
changes and birthday parties. There's Mommy feeding the baby carrots,
bandaging a toddler's knee, tying a ribbon in the hair of a
5-year-old wearing a droopy evening gown and plastic high heels.</TE>
<TE>   I used to protest uselessly. I looked fat, disheveled; my hair
wasn't combed, the house was a mess, my shirt was stained. Hardly the
recorded image I wanted future generations to see.</TE>
<TE>   Now I watch these tapes with a mixture of awe and wistfulness. I
hardly notice the girth or the messy hair or the obviously unstylish
clothes. I see, instead, a mother baking cookies, cuddling a baby,
admonishing a toddler to stay out of the street. I hear a father
encouraging a 4-year-old, as she wobbles by on her two-wheeled bike.</TE>
<TE>   I watch sisters hugging, squabbling over a cookie; a baby dozing
on her daddy's chest, covered with her sisters' kisses as she sleeps.</TE>
<TE>   "Enjoy it while you can.... It goes by so fast."</TE>
<TE>   I've always had to stifle my irritation at that advice, earnestly
delivered by well-meaning parents whose children have invariably left
the nest.</TE>
<TE>   From my perspective, time is not speeding by at all. In fact,
these years have seemed interminable--one long day after another; an
unending, juggling marathon of motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it is impossible to appreciate the speed at which
childhood rushes past when you are in the midst of its demands ...
making your 5,000th peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich, wiping another
runny nose, reading "Goodnight Moon" for the zillionth time. I did
not remember how much I'd forgotten until I saw our former life play
out on the TV screen.</TE>
<TE>   I realize, though we couldn't have known it then, that we were
living a life so good, so pure, so simple, it seems now like the
American Dream. And though things have changed--the children have
grown, their father has passed on, our lives have grown more
complicated--I take comfort in knowing that the essence of who we are
remains.</TE>
<TE>   I glance over at my girls, sprawled on the couch, arms and legs
draped across one another, amused by the images they see. The
birthday girl still has the same broad smile and shining brown eyes;
same sunny disposition and squeaky voice. The impatient toddler is
now a restless 13-year-old, a daredevil in constant motion. The baby
is still steady and determined, with an easy laugh and a stubborn
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they fail to recognize their current selves in those little
girls on the screen. "I can't believe how goofy I looked," my oldest
says, laughing at the birthday girl on TV, with her pouf of curly
hair, missing front teeth, black stretch pants and clip-on earrings.</TE>
<TE>   And the sound that fills the room is the same as the laugh we
heard coming from the TV, from a 6-year-old going on 17.</TE>

<LD>In an event with so many celebs in attendance that it might have been
an awards ceremony, "The Race to Erase MS" gala pulled in a cool $2.5
million.</LD>
<LD>   It's been 11 years since Nancy Davis learned that she had multiple
sclerosis and nine since the glamorous daughter of Barbara and Marvin
Davis launched the annual event to fund the Nancy Davis Center
Without Walls. The center is a consortium of researchers from six
universities to seek a cure for the autoimmune disease that most
frequently attacks women between 20 and 40.</LD>
<LD>   This year's event, held May 10 at the Century Plaza Hotel &amp; Spa,
included the proceeds from an auction conducted by Bill Maher, Tony
Danza and Tom Arnold. Among prizes on the block: a stay at Olympic
luge camp that Montel Williams (diagnosed with MS in 1999) snapped up
for $16,000; a white Cadillac, autographed by 70 celebrity guests,
that went for $45,300; an original sketch by LeRoy Neiman bought by
Jon Lovitz. An "Ultimate Hollywood Party" to be catered by Wolfgang
Puck went to high bidder Ray Romano, and racking up a winning bid of
$32,000 was an invitation to Arnold's bachelor party--he'll wed
Shelby Roos in June.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1,300 guests packed the ballroom for the bash, which had
a '70s "Peace and Love" theme, complete with neon peace symbols and
caged go-go dancers. Sela Ward and Jay Mohr hosted the entertainment,
a runway fashion show by Tommy Hilfiger (co-sponsor of the event with
VH1, American Airlines and the Century Plaza) and performances by Don
Henley, Stevie Nicks, Donna Summer and Smokey Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   In the crowd were Nancy's sons--Alexander, Brandon and Jason--and
her mom and dad (Marvin said he's shed 80 pounds). So were Candy and
Aaron Spelling, Debbie Allen, Angela Bassett, Jennifer Tilly, Jackie
Collins, Shannen Doherty, David Faustino, Joely Fisher, Teri Garr,
Kathy Griffin, Harry Hamlin, Melissa Joan Hart, Brooke Shields,
Beverly Johnson, Lisa Kudrow, Ashton Kutcher, Cheryl Ladd, Bai Ling,
Alex Michel ("The Bachelor"), Ming-Na, Holly Robinson Peete, Natalie
Raitano, Tara Reid, Denise Rich, Lisa Rinna, John Ritter, Antonio
Sabato Jr., Molly Simms, Sylvester Stallone, Paul Stanley, Cheryl
Tiegs, Wilmer Valderrama and Roshumba Williams. Since its inception,
the MS event has raised more than $16 million.</TE>

<TE>   eforeOle! America</TE>
<TE>   The Bilingual Foundation of the Arts celebrated the contributions
of veteran actress Carmen Zapata at its 22nd annual benefit, "eforeOle!
America," at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Zapata, president, producing director and co-founder of the
foundation, an L.A.-based Latino theater, was presented with the El
Angel Lifetime Achievement Award. Her 50-year career has earned her
multiple honors including a knighthood in 1999 from King Juan Carlos
of Spain.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting the award--presented by foundation alumnus Andy
Garcia and co-founders Margarita Galban and Estela Scarlata--Zapata
said: "Only in America could three Hispanic women from very humble
beginnings build a theater for a needy and deserving community that
would last for 30 years. We are survivors, and we're filled with love
for our community and its rich Hispanic heritage. It's our way of
saying muchisimas gracias."</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 attended the event May 9 event, which raised
$150,000. Honored for their corporate support of the foundation's
arts programs were the Walt Disney Co. and Farmers Insurance Group.
James Albaugh served as event chairman with co-chairmen Richard
Hartnack and Lynn Pike. KABC-TV's Sid Garcia emceed the doings, which
featured a sizzling "Habanera" by L.A. Opera mezzo soprano Suzanna
Guzman and a flamenco by dancer Mari Sandoval. The evening ended with
a conga line, a tradition at this affair.</TE>
<TE>   Spotted among the movers and shakers were Bob Gomez, Jonathan
Weedman, George Ramirez, Al Greenstein, Christina Sanchez-Camino,
Lisa Baca-Sigala, Lourdes Marta, Pamela Villarreal, Ralph Perez,
Rossina Gallegos, Michelle Bandoian, Denise Bernadin, John Echeveste,
Vince Ramirez, Marian Shima and Jose Luis Dicenta Ballester, the
consul general of Spain in Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   Artistic Fusion</TE>
<TE>   Marking its premiere collaboration with the Fashion Institute of
Design &amp; Merchandising in Los Angeles, the Long Beach Museum of Art
launched its new exhibit, "Spontaneous Combustion: The Fusion of Art,
Design and Fashion" with a cocktail party and style show that raised
$50,000 for its education programs. Hundreds of arts lovers gathered
at the oceanfront facility May 11 to tour the exhibit that features
pairings of fashion and furniture created by graduating institute
students.</TE>
<TE>   ''The show represents an interdisciplinary project,'' an institute
spokeswoman said. ''Students of interior design and fashion got
together and explored how they engage in similar kinds of thinking.''
The result: 11 fashion ensembles displayed next to as many chairs,
each employing the same textiles and mood. The exhibit continues
through June 2.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the party agenda: a fashion show by Los Angeles designer
Kevan Hall, a graduate of the institute. Hall, whose clothing has
been worn by celebs such as Celine Dion and Minnie Driver, showcased
his spring 2002 collection.</TE>
<TE>   Guests applauded as models floated by in ultra-feminine,
body-skimming styles in hues that ranged from tangerine to taupe.
''The colors were inspired by Christian Berard, a '30s artist and set
designer,'' Hall said. ''I always look back to that period; it's one
I love.''</TE>

<TE>   Symphony's Stars</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Symphony's South America-inspired "Noche de
Estrellas'' (Night of the Stars) gala to benefit its music education
programs drew 500 guests and netted $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   Guests swept along a jungle-green carpet as they entered the Hyatt
Regency Irvine for a gala cocktail reception and gourmet dinner
staged in a ballroom replete with towering palms, brightly colored
floral arrangements and gushing fountains.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at tables crowned with terra-cotta urns filled with roses,
guests dined on authentic South American cuisine: spicy shrimp and
mango ceviche, corn flan, chile-encrusted tenderloin and a chocolate
almond basket filled with coffee creme brulee.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment at the May 11 event included the Los Angeles Guitar
Quartet and a dance troupe that performed an electrifying "Tango
Spectacular." Guests included gala co-chairwomen Janice Smith and
Dotti Stillwell; orchestra music director Carl St.Clair and his wife,
Susan; John and Sandy Daniels; Jo Ellen Qualls; Ellie and Michael
Gordon; Henry and Elizabeth Segerstrom; and Roger and Janice Johnson.</TE>

<LD>Grandmother finished reading a book of Mother Goose rhymes to Rosie
and her friend, Nola.</LD>
<LD>   "I like those rhymes," said Nola.</LD>
<LD>   "Me, too," Rosie said. "Let's make up a Mother Goose story
together."</LD>
<TE>   "Good idea," said Nola.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time there was a little girl named Bo Peep. She always
watched over her sheep. But one day something terrible happened. She
lost them. So she set out at once to find them.</TE>
<TE>   She walked and walked until she met two children on a hill. "I
have lost my sheep," Bo Peep called. "Have you seen them?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry, but we have not," Jack said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are climbing this hill to fetch a pail of water," said Jill.</TE>
<TE>   Bo Peep walked on until she came to a big egg sitting on top of a
wall. "I have lost my sheep," said Bo Peep. "Have you seen them?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nope," answered Humpty Dumpty. "I can't turn to look or I might
fall."</TE>
<TE>   Bo Peep walked on until she came to a maiden in a garden. "I have
lost my sheep," said Bo Peep. "Have you seen them?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, my dear," answered Mistress Mary. "I'm trying to plant silver
bells and cockle shells."</TE>
<TE>   Bo Peep walked on until she came to five little pigs on a farm. "I
have lost my sheep," said Bo Peep. "Have you seen them?"</TE>
<TE>   "I can't talk now," replied the biggest pig. "I'm rushing off to
market."</TE>
<TE>   Bo Peep sighed and wiped a tear from her eye. Finally she turned
and started back. Just as she arrived at her house, she heard
something.</TE>
<TE>   "Baaa baaa baaa."</TE>
<TE>   "My sheep!" she cried happily. "I left them alone and they came
home. And there they are--wagging their tails behind them."</TE>
<TE>   Rosie and Nola smiled. Together they said, "The end."</TE>

<HD>The Incredible Shrinking Middle Class</HD>
<DH>The once-ultimate goal is more elusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm sorry to see the middle class and the aspirations of middle
class-ness fading.</LD>
<LD>   It was the dream of my grandparents to reach the middle class. It
was the soil in which my parents rooted their lives, and from which I
sprouted. I was taught the lesson early, and later I saw it with my
own eyes: The egalitarianism of the middle class distinguished this
country from much of the world, and we were better off as a result.</LD>
<LD>   Embedded in those words--"middle class"--was a communal sense of
domain, purpose and economic equilibrium.</LD>
<TE>   If you don't know where you are, said the writer Wendell Barry,
you don't know who you are. The middle class gave people a place no
matter where they were.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there was ridicule, no small measure of it justified. The
middle class was conformist, insipid and stifling. At some point, and
I'm not exactly sure when, I became aware that describing someone or
something as middle class was a criticism, not a compliment.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe its shortcomings were the result of the fact that the middle
class didn't have time to work the bugs out. The post-Depression,
postwar ascendancy of the middle class lasted less than half a
century before it began to pull apart.</TE>
<TE>   The latest census report only confirms the obvious: In
trend-setting 21st century Southern California, the wealthy class and
the underclass are mushrooming at the expense of the center.
Naturally, there are many more poor than rich. So when the numbers
are averaged out, this "unprecedented era of prosperity," as we
mistakenly called the 1990s, actually produced a decline in median
household income--7.5% in Los Angeles County and 1.8% in adjacent
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Today, less than one-third of the residents of Los Angeles can
afford the price of the average home.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, income is more unevenly distributed than at any time
since at least 1941, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The
research organization's latest accounting shows the top 1% of
Americans have amassed 38% of the country's personal wealth.
One-fifth of the population accounts for 83%, leaving four-fifths to
share in only 17%. U.S. News &amp; World Report says that the United
States now leads the industrialized world in the gulf between rich
and poor.</TE>
<TE>   Optimists might see good signs in the census figures. At least
part of the American dream is alive, you cannot deny that. The
affluent command respect and admiration. At the other end of the
economic barbell, immigrants are drawn to Southern California as the
land of opportunity, never mind that they are classified as living in
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the trend represents the defeat of idealism.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of the middle class represented a leap forward in social
progress, both in aim and fact. Better living for everyone. By
contrast, a stratified society with a thin veneer of wealth atop a
growing underclass is an atavistic throwback in the social order. And
a disturbing one from my middle-class perspective. Such arrangements
historically depend on force, not consent. Better living for a few. I
remember the chill I felt the first time I saw a house in Los Angeles
with broken glass cemented on the top of a masonry wall--a sign of
our certain descent into the class disparity and dissension that I
associate with lesser places.</TE>
<TE>   The thing about the middle class is that it was plausible. We
proved that, at least for a time. Our competitive urges could be
collectively satisfied, and not necessarily at the expense of others.
Between Ford people and Chevy people, there was not much of a gap.
That old phrase, "All men are created equal," had a truer ring to it.</TE>
<TE>   Today our public debates echo middle-class tenets, such as
equality in public education and fair reward for honest work. But our
individual actions increasingly recognize that ideals are
disappearing into myth. We seem to have accepted the fact that only a
few will excel in the bitter competition we have arranged for
tomorrow, while far more will be losers. Capital is more important
than labor.</TE>
<TE>   At the convenience store down the street, I watch immigrant
workers park their beat-up commuter bicycles at the door. They know
the fable about how hard work is justly rewarded in America. You can
read it in the sweat stains in their shirts.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality? A decent house for their family? A good school
for their kids? Reliable medical care when they are sick?</TE>
<TE>   For those things, honest work may not be enough anymore. They
reach into their slender wallets and buy lottery tickets.</TE>

<HD>One Sure Way to Pass on Paying for a Football Stadium</HD>
<DH>Voters can blitz any NFL bid to get taxpayer dollars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is the associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The snake-oil salesmen from the National Football League are at our
door again, offering L.A. a pro team if we'll just build them a new
stadium.</LD>
<LD>   And a group of successful local business leaders are asking City
Hall for the tax subsidies they need to break ground on the project
ASAP. They even have a site picked out downtown, around the corner
from Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   This is getting serious. It's time for a new Proposition N.</LD>
<TE>   For those who have forgotten, Proposition N was a charter
amendment passed by Los Angeles voters in 1978. It prohibited, with a
few narrow exceptions, the spending of any city funds in connection
with the 1984 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   It was a controversial measure when it was approved, but it also
was consistent. Just a few months earlier, L.A. voters had been in
the forefront when the state electorate approved Proposition 13,
setting off a tax revolt whose political echoes resonate to this day.</TE>
<TE>   However shortsighted Proposition N may have seemed at the time, in
retrospect it was one of those tough but necessary stances by local
leadership that eventually helped make the 1984 Games the rousing
success they were, with a profit exceeding $220 million.</TE>
<TE>   It helped convince the elite snobs who ran the International
Olympic Committee that Mayor Tom Bradley, Peter Ueberroth--who was
head of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee--and other local
leaders were serious when they said Los Angeles would not pay for the
kind of overblown Olympics the IOC had grown accustomed to staging.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the vote on Proposition N, IOC officials were
promising that the Los Angeles Games would be "spartan" and not run
up billion-dollar deficits as Montreal did in 1976. But the 76% vote
in favor of the amendment put the force of law and the will of the
people behind assurances that taxpayers' wallets would be protected.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to forget all this amid the fond memories shared by
those who were here during that remarkable summer of 1984. But it is
no exaggeration to say that, almost until the day they opened, the
1984 Olympics were regarded with the same mix of apathy and hostility
that most Angelenos now feel regarding the possible return of the
NFL. Then, as now, the prevailing attitude was: They need us more
than we need them.</TE>
<TE>   Which may provide some solace to the honchos of Anschutz
Entertainment Group, which owns and operates Staples Center, and
their partners in the group negotiating with the NFL for a new
franchise in exchange for a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The AEG partnership showed off its plans for a new football venue
last week, a 64,000-seat monstrosity that could cost as much as $450
million. And they insist that it can be done without any cost to the
taxpayers. But L.A. taxpayers need more than assurances.</TE>
<TE>   That's why City Council members are drafting resolutions and
introducing motions aimed at protecting the city treasury from raids
by sleazy NFL owners like the odd couple this city tolerated far
longer than we should have: the Rams' Georgia Frontiere and the
Raiders' Al Davis.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a better way to show the NFL, once and for all, that
L.A. is serious about not spending any public money on a new football
team or a new stadium to put it in.</TE>
<TE>   Another Proposition N.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, an ordinance or charter amendment barring the use of
public funds to bring the NFL back to L.A. would constrain city
officials. But who among us would really want to send a waif like
Mayor James K. Hahn into the same room with the hustlers who run the
NFL without a little protection?</TE>
<TE>   Besides, it would strengthen the hand of the private-sector group
negotiating with the NFL, just as surely as the original Proposition
N helped strengthen the hand of Ueberroth and the others who ran the
LAOOC.</TE>
<TE>   So let's draft another Proposition N. We should even call it that
to remind everyone what it's about: nada for the NFL.</TE>

<HD>Amid Snubs, Latin America Slips</HD>
<DH>A Washington preoccupied with terrorism appears indifferent
to other crises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD N. LUTTWAK</AU>
<BD>Edward N. Luttwak is a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and dozens of
lesser officials were focused for weeks on the siege of Yasser
Arafat's office and the Bethlehem stand-off. Only a few dozen people
were involved in these affairs, and the outcome was yet again bound
to be inconclusive. Yet the television cameras were there, and that
was enough to ensure the full attention of the U.S. government.</LD>
<LD>   In the meantime, with no TV anchors present, the largest part of
the Western Hemisphere, from Mexico to Patagonia, continued to slide
into crises that threaten the most important U.S. interests and
values, from the supply of oil--much more than we buy from the entire
Middle East--to economic liberalization and even democratic
governance.</LD>
<TE>   Argentina's economy, paralyzed by financial collapse, is now
literally disintegrating as businesses simply shut down and the rural
population retreats into subsistence. That inflicts heavy damage on
nearby Uruguay, with adverse effects on impoverished Paraguay and
Bolivia and even prosperous Chile. Brazil, with its trillion-dollar
economy and 170 million inhabitants, will not be wrecked by
Argentina's troubles, but those troubles are weakening both its
export-driven economy and popular support for the free-market
policies that Argentina exemplified from the early 1990s. Not by
coincidence, the presidential candidate who is now leading in the
polls is Luiz Ignacio da Silva, a long-standing opponent of
privatization and deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Only in Colombia is there a full-fledged internal war underway.
But even Venezuela's much less violent political convulsions--under
the corrupt populism of Hugo Chavez--certainly block its economic
recovery and threaten U.S. oil supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of the global economic slowdown, with its low commodity
prices, is most severe in the poorest countries--Bolivia, Ecuador and
Peru.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even Mexico, for all its economic and political progress of
recent years, is suffering the consequences. The sharp fall in
exports to the United States has stymied growth and shrunk government
revenue--undermining the best intentions of its government to relieve
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   That in turn explains the surge in illegal immigration, which
collides with the new United States preoccupation with border
security, although Latin Americans are almost universally our friends
in every way rather than U.S.-hating terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The United States government has reacted with spectacular
inattention to these vast events, whose consequences are already
serious and could easily become much worse.</TE>
<TE>   With scarcely a minute of the president's time since Sept. 11, and
not much more from his Cabinet officials--even the Treasury secretary
has found reasons to virtually ignore Argentina's collapse--policy
has inevitably drifted.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious objection to more U.S. activism is that Latin
America's problems are structural and cultural; critics argue that
more United States action would be useless.</TE>
<TE>   As for economic aid, any large increase is fiscally impossible and
could only be appropriate in any case to help the poorest Andean
countries.</TE>
<TE>   But that overlooks the political and psychological dimension of
U.S.-Latin America relations: Even visits by mere undersecretaries,
let alone Cabinet officials, raise the morale of local reformers,
force decisions on outstanding issues and provide opportunities to
solve problems in open markets.</TE>
<TE>   It is on that score that the charge of gross inattention can be
proven: On Thursday, the 1991 Andean Trade Preferences Act, designed
to promote legal alternatives to cocaine production, expired in
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru because of Senate objections
engineered by the textile lobby.</TE>
<TE>   The White House could easily overcome that now weak lobby with a
small fraction of the president's time and political leverage. Even
that has been denied, however, as if to prove to our neighbors that
we are indifferent to their plight.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So intelligence sources informed President Bush in August that Osama
bin Laden's terrorists might attempt to hijack airplanes? Excuse us,
but administration officials have good reason to look perplexed as
they wonder aloud what the increasingly indignant chorus of critics
would have had the president do with that amorphous warning.</LD>
<LD>   Smart politicians will leave the retroactive theorizing about
Sept. 11 to the nation's Art Bells and Oliver Stones, step past the
infinite permutations of "what if" and get down to investigating how
to assure that U.S. intelligence agencies are competent to prevent
future catastrophes.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has tried to avoid inquiries about how the
FBI, CIA and other agencies did their jobs in the weeks leading up to
9/11. But a relative wealth of significant information is emerging
anyway.</LD>
<TE>   An FBI agent in Phoenix seems to have come close to cracking the
plot; in July, he wrote to FBI headquarters warning of Middle Eastern
men attending American flight schools. In August, another FBI agent
conjectured that Zacarias Moussaoui might have been training to fly a
hijacked plane. And in 1999 the Library of Congress warned the CIA
that Al Qaeda might use hijacked planes as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   How can agencies coordinate their information so that vague
hijacking threats reported to the CIA take on added meaning in light
of FBI agents' individual observations?</TE>
<TE>   Congress is rightly insisting on expanding its inquiries. The
House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting a joint
investigation, but they have been stymied by foot-dragging at the CIA
and FBI. Only Bush has the clout to pull the agencies into line and
force them to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress prepares to spend additional billions on intelligence,
it and the American public have a right to know where the government
fell short before Sept. 11 and what it has learned from those
failings.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic leaders should not posture and pretend that it would
have been a simple matter to prevent the unprecedented use of
aircraft as terrorist-guided missiles. But unless the United States
completely scrutinizes what went wrong, it will remain dangerously
vulnerable.</TE>

<LD>Secession fever has spread to the planet Coruscant. In the latest
"Star Wars" prequel, queen-turned-senator Padme Amidala and Jedi
knight Obi-Wan Kenobi fight to preserve the troubled Republic against
the Separatists. Yes, it's only a movie. But this much is true: Any
leader worth his or her light saber would fight to keep a great
galaxy, a great country--or a great city--from self-destructing.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn is no Jedi knight, but last week he was out
there fighting for Los Angeles. He told the commission deciding
whether San Fernando Valley secession should be put to voters in
November that its analysis failed to prove that the Valley and the
remaining city would stay financially whole. Hahn was right to stand
up to a commission that has become more cheerleader than judge of the
three secession bids before it. But as important as the legalities is
the battle for the hearts of voters on either side of Mulholland
Drive, for the heart of a city as diverse and electrifying as any
fictional universe.</LD>
<TE>   Angelenos have been remarkably detached from the prospect of
dismantling their city. Los Angeles is for the most part a go-along,
get-along kind of place. Take a Times poll in March that showed close
to 50% support for secession citywide and just over 50% in the
Valley. (It would have to win in both to pass.) The same poll found
that residents throughout the city were pretty happy with the way
things were going.</TE>
<TE>   So why split? The sentiment outside the Valley seems to be, "If
they want to go, why not let them?"</TE>
<TE>   Because the Valley is Los Angeles, that's why. It is the
middle-class heart of a city increasingly split between the very rich
and the very poor, a place where rising immigrants pursue the
American dream of a house with a backyard as fervently as did the
grandparents of third- and fourth-generation Angelenos before them. A
city depends on its middle class, not just for a tax base but for
stability.</TE>
<TE>   The city has problems, of course, given its geographic and
demographic breadth. But size and variety also are part of Los
Angeles' allure and energy, drawing artists and entrepreneurs,
generating jobs, inspiring hilltop museums and conveying worldwide
name recognition and clout.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking up the city would not change how the schools, which are
governed separately, are run, although residents often mistakenly
cite this as reason to secede. A new Valley city of 1.4 million
residents would have far less chance of creating a sense of
community--such a sense is another reason cited for secession--than
would the much-smaller neighborhood councils created by charter
reform, 30 of which have already formed.</TE>
<TE>   When Los Angeles residents from throughout the city voted to
rewrite the charter, almost eight decades old, they did so in the
belief that they could make this big, frustrating, dynamic, exciting
and always surprising city work better. A nascent idea in the City
Council to set up a borough system like New York's is in that same
can-do spirit. Han Solo, after all, didn't pack up and leave when the
going got tough. (Well, OK, he thought about it.) He pulled out his
screwdriver and coaxed his mechanically challenged spaceship into
action, willing to see what he could get it to do. A lot, as it
turned out.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn needs to work harder to kindle this kind of proud and
adventurous civic spirit. But he can't save the city alone. To your
light sabers, citizens of Los Angeles. All of Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>Someday soon someone should study the impact of all these studies
that emerge daily on virtually every imaginable subject. They're
scary, curious, interesting. Some may even be important.</LD>
<LD>   High school seniors must have skipped history class because, a new
study shows, 57% lack even a basic knowledge of their own history;
only 48% knew the Soviet Union was a World War II ally and only 35%
of fourth-graders connect the Boston Tea Party with the American
Revolution. For all they know, the Civil War was East against West
under the guy who invented the Lincoln.</LD>
<LD>   One study of kids found the curious, outgoing ones, if they
survive numerous risky adventures, develop higher IQs than shyer
peers. Other research finds that adolescents watching more than one
hour of TV daily are nearly four times likelier to commit violent or
aggressive acts later. Program content was blamed. But nonscientific
observations also trace subsequent aggression to constant flicking
among 100 channels, to find nothing worth watching. A study of
ancient church records in Finland (seriously) found that women with
sons lived a few months less than women who had given birth to
daughters. This confirms the suspicions of many boys' parents.</LD>
<TE>   A study by the Social Security Administration reports Jacob and
Emily as the most popular names for newborns, ahead of Michael,
Matthew, Joshua and Christopher and Madison, Hannah, Ashley and
Alexis. Among the least popular girls' names were Keyla, Tatianna and
Miah. Not many boys' parents choose Rocky, Yehuda, Benito or Mustafa.</TE>
<TE>   The worst cities for car theft are Phoenix, Miami and Fresno,
followed by Detroit, Sacramento and Tucson. Not too good leaving your
car in Stockton either. Talk about cell phones as dangerous driving
diversions, new research says hot coffee is the most hazardous food
to consume at the wheel. Jelly doughnuts aren't safe, but they're
safer. And it's not recommended to get in front of drivers eating hot
soup, chili or tacos. Tacos? In a moving car? Maybe an aggressive,
adventurous, TV-watching adolescent named Benito.</TE>
<TE>   Which all seems to confirm the little-known maxim of Fred Rogers,
founder of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." He once said, quietly, "I
think we are created deep and simple. Society doesn't nurture that.
Society nurtures shallow and complicated." More food there--not for
driving but for thought.</TE>

<HD>Warnings on Hijackings and Fund-Raiser Photo</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush Told of Likely Hijacks," May 16: President Bush knew that
Osama bin Laden-sponsored airplane hijackings were a possibility at
least one month before 9/11. That briefing came when our
CEO-president was on his monthlong vacation in Texas. His spin
doctors said they didn't know the planes would be used as missiles.
Oh, as long as the planes were simply hijacked that was acceptable to
this White House. It looks as if nothing was done.</LD>
<LD>   Ari Fleischer says the appropriate agencies were notified. Who,
those jokers in airport security who don't even know when the metal
detectors are turned off? Fleischer's spin rings very hollow. Why has
it taken eight months for this story to surface, via a congressional
investigation?</LD>
<LD>   Last week Bush and his party began a fund-raising drive showing
three of his defining moments, which included a photo of him in Air
Force One on 9/11 talking to the vice president. My three photos of
his defining moments are: 1) accepting Enron contributions; 2) the
smoking New York City skyline; 3) the photo of him visiting a
kindergarten when he was told of the attack, when the word
"incompetence" can be seen on his face. Hail to the
commander-incompetent! Bush sold us Californians out to Enron and his
other vested energy interests. Now it appears he let down the
country. If there were ever grounds for impeachment, dereliction of
duty seems like a fair charge.</LD>

<TE>   U.S. and Italian officials were warned of the threat of a
hijacking and suicide flight into the Group of 8 meeting in Genoa in
July. So Bush can't deny he never heard of the idea of suicide
hijackers. Time will tell that they dropped the ball while panicking
over Enron.</TE>

<TE>   Why are we criticizing the FBI for lack of action before Sept. 11?
If the FBI had presented all the information it had about potential
terrorism before the attacks, would it have made any difference?
Would we have agreed to our current actions and expenditures against
terrorism? Not a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than criticizing the agency in hindsight, perhaps we should
realize it was better attuned to the threats than we previously
suspected. This is good news.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hindsight is wonderful, and it seems that many law enforcement
critics and members of Congress are quick to jump on facts regarding
piecemeal knowledge of potential terrorist attacks prior to 9/11.
Members of Congress should stop being critical of the FBI and CIA and
start focusing on how they can do a better job of crafting
legislation to support law enforcement efforts, like increasing
border security and immigration reform.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's easy to see the picture of a puzzle after the pieces are
together, but give credit and support to members of the FBI and CIA
for doing their best all the years we've lived in relative safety.
It's easy to point fingers after the fact, but for the safety of our
nation, it's not what we need.</TE>

campaign funds by using a photo of the president performing his
duties? What's wrong with the traditional fund-raising practices of
renting White House bedrooms and pardoning felons?</TE>

<TE>   The Democrats should be elated that the Republicans are using the
photo of George W. calling his vice president from the safety of Air

"Gee, what should I do now?"</TE>

<HD>Council Allows IDs for Illegal Immigrants</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "L.A. to Honor Identity Cards From Mexico," May 15: Since when
does the L.A. City Council take on the responsibilities of the
federal government and the useless Immigration and Naturalization
Service? Allowing any type of legitimacy to those who break our laws
is almost treasonous. The council voted to honor the Mexican
government's matricula consular. This will bring another flood tide
of illegal immigration, crime, ethnic enclaves and
non-English-speaking people here for a free handout. They will never
learn the language or our culture or even try to be Americans. The
cry of amnesty will be heard, and the INS will twiddle its thumbs.</LD>
<LD>   All noncitizens and illegal aliens should be deported. There has
been no medical screening or criminal background check. If we need
workers, let them buy a yearly permit. If their country is no good,
they should stay there and change it. I am sick and tired of paying
taxes to feed, clothe, educate and provide medical services to
non-Americans. There are enough Americans who need help, cities to
clean up and infrastructure items to repair and replace.</LD>
<LD>   Edwin Lindley Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Pico Rivera</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a U.S. citizen, I find the continued debate in California over
the "official acceptance" of the matricula consular simply
embarrassing. U.S. persons cannot be required to carry and show
"their papers" on demand.</TE>
<TE>   California is virtually alone among U.S. states in demanding that
all applicants for driver's licenses prove their "legal presence" in
a federal immigration sense in order to obtain a driver's license. As
a result, millions of California residents are prevented from
obtaining this most commonly accepted voluntary means of
identification, even though many of these same immigrants have been
issued valid Social Security numbers or other tax ID numbers by the
federal government, and many others are simply awaiting adjustments
of their immigration status to permanent residency or citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   I can't decide which makes less sense: the false debate over the
validity of optional identity papers or the ridiculous California
motor vehicle law that "incentivizes" unlicensed immigrants to drive
cars that they can't insure on our crowded highways.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Americans' Right to a Dual Identity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am sympathetic to Patrick Osio's idea that the priorities of
Mexican immigrants and their children often differ (Commentary, May
3). Yet, as a Mexican American, I know that questions of identity,
culture and loyalty are not settled simply.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican Americans may spend summers in small villages with their
Mexican grandparents, and return in the fall to American history
courses at their universities. They feel at home in both places. I
believe that they must have a right to both identities, to both
languages, to both nations.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico would not pursue "the whole enchilada"--amnesty and a guest
worker program--if economists right up to Alan Greenspan did not
agree that the U.S. economy needs immigrant labor. Surely, the
Mexican government cannot ask Mexican Americans to "choose" Mexico
over the U.S., for the greatest gift they can give Mexico is their
bilingualism and their biculturalism. Part of the "whole enchilada"
is to include Mexican Americans and their representatives in the
Mexican national dialogue. The world I want to live in is one in
which Osio, the editor of HispanicVista.com, would address the
Mexican government about what matters most to Mexican Americans, on
the pages of The Times. Thank you for bringing us one day closer.</LD>

<HD>To Have and Have Not: NFL Stadium Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "NFL Stadium Plan Outlined," May 16: If we in L.A. "need" a
football stadium by the Staples Center--and I doubt that we do--here
are a couple of suggestions to make it less of a blot on the
landscape and more a part of the city:</LD>
<LD>   * Improve transit access, limit car parking and put the parking
under the stadium. That way the stadium can be part of the fabric of
the city, much as the classic East Coast stadiums have been, and not
be an isolated hulk in the middle of a vast and usually empty space.</LD>
<LD>   * Fill most of the ground-floor perimeter of the stadium with
retail and eating places, places that locals and visitors would use
even on nongame days. With the stadium right on the street, this
would not only be feasible, it would also create jobs and commerce
every day of the year, with those shops and restaurants benefiting
all the more on game days.</LD>
<TE>   Otherwise, we'll be building yet another hole downtown, doing
nothing to help L.A. grow into a real city.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Risemberg</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tagliabue has made it clear that the L.A. Coliseum would not
be suitable for an NFL team because there is no place for the rich
people to sit. It's funny that for two Olympics and numerous other
events, it seemed to work just fine: The haves and have-nots simply
got together to watch a sporting event.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson Davis</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't see anything about considering available areas in the San
Fernando Valley for a new stadium complex. There should be plenty of
space, transportation and other amenities available for this in
various places there. This would create jobs and other benefits to
the area, as well as avoiding even more congestion in downtown L.A.
Another slight for the Valley?</TE>
<TE>   Bob Abrahams</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the last things L.A. needs is a new football stadium. What
we do need are new schools--85 of them. Our young people must endure
overcrowding in classrooms, buildings that are falling apart,
traveling hours a day to and from school on buses and a district that
can't seem to get its act together.</TE>
<TE>   This proposed new stadium would be going up in the section of the
city where new schools are needed most. Not one cent of taxpayer
money or government bonds should be spent on this millionaires'
playground for the stars. If L.A. wants a football team that badly,
let it play in the Coliseum. Don't build a new stadium; build our
children new schools.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Internet or a .45, It's Robbery of the Artist," Commentary,
May 15: John Balzar misses one very important point. Consumers have
no problem compensating artists for their work, but CDs that are
priced at $18.99 are paying for record company executives' lavish
lifestyles. I have worked at a record company in the past, and these
record executives are living large. High-six-figure and even
seven-figure salaries are paid to these people. We consumers are
paying for it.</LD>
<LD>   The Internet gives artists the opportunity to market directly to
their audience without the record company. Getting rid of the
middleman is a good thing. It's about the artist's relationship with
the consumer. Plus, an artist does not have to sell a million copies
to start making a profit. If CDs were priced at $9.99, I believe that
people would be more than happy to pay the bill. At $18.99-plus, it
is the consumer who is being ripped.</LD>

education at the high school where I teach. Last week, all students
who hadn't passed the new exit exam (most of the kids) spent three
entire days testing. This week all ESL students are taking the SABE
test. For the next two weeks, all students will be taking the
Stanford 9, then the ESL kids take the APRENDA test for another week.</LD>
<LD>   That's three weeks of class missed or severely limited due to
testing for the regular students, and five weeks for the ESL
students. And this is helping them learn more how?</LD>

<HD>Trouble at Home</HD>
<DH>The housing boom helped us out of the recession, but it may
be a new financial bubble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>David Friedman, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a
senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After all the rhapsody about the digital age, it was skyrocketing
home prices and sales that finally shook the U.S. economy out of its
doldrums this year. While stock markets languished, mortgage
refinancing pumped more than $1 trillion into consumers' pockets.
Nationally, average home prices rose above the $200,000 mark for the
first time ever. But rather than signal prosperity, the housing boom
may be largely driven by the financial maneuvers of wealthier
Americans. Housing, in fact, has become part of the bubble economy,
with potential consequences more serious than the stock market
fiasco.</LD>
<LD>   Historically, the housing market has closely mirrored the nation's
underlying economic health: strong during good times, weak during
bad. After World War II, state and federal incentives, including
lavish tax deductions and outright subsidies, encouraged
homeownership and construction. Housing starts steadily rose. The
mortgage-lending industry expanded. The proportion of U.S. households
owning homes grew from less than 45% in the 1940s to about 65% by
1965.</LD>
<TE>   The relationship between housing and the larger economy shifted
markedly in the mid-1970s. Oddly, U.S. residential real estate
investment started to peak when stock and other equity markets, and
often the economy, cooled. Data collected by Susanne Trimbath, a
research economist at the Milken Institute, show that this obverse
relationship between housing prices and Wall Street intensified
throughout the 1990s. Something other than buying a home was shaping
the housing industry.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthier, investment-savvy Americans were learning that the
housing finance system was a tax-subsidized means to offset losses in
stocks and other financial assets. As long as stocks and paper
securities appreciated in value, they parked most of their capital in
such equities. During the recent stock market boom, in fact, the
share of residential real estate in the average American's personal
asset portfolio fell to historical lows.</TE>
<TE>   When equity markets went out of whack at the peak of the
leveraged-buyout craze of the 1980s and the Internet mania of the
1990s, the paper economy dramatically shrank. But housing finance was
a near-perfect antidote for the disappearing windfalls.</TE>
<TE>   After Wall Street collapsed, the Federal Reserve Board lowered
interest rates to promote long-term business investment and
jump-start U.S. factories. The sharply lower interest rates also
enabled cash-strapped investors to refinance their mortgages, cut
their monthly payments and tap their real estate equity--all with
substantial tax advantages. As a result, America's wealthier classes,
in particular, could maintain their lifestyles despite suffering
equity market setbacks and even have a few dollars left over to wager
on the next stock craze.</TE>
<TE>   In the recession just ended, mortgage refinancing unquestionably
stimulated consumer spending, because U.S. job and income growth were
relatively stagnant. By the end of 2001, mortgage originations topped
$2 trillion, and refinancings accounted for nearly 60% of that total.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, using the housing market as medicine for Wall Street-induced
ills can produce dangerous side effects. One is the need to maintain
high home prices. Housing sales set the maximum loan amount at any
particular time. As long as houses remain relatively expensive and
homeowners have large equity "cushions" in their property, lenders
are happy to write enormous loans--even during economic downturns.
But if home prices fell in line with other equity markets, they would
think twice before making such loans.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, homeowners have every reason to keep their homes
expensive. And, by coincidence or design, as home-equity finance has
gained popularity, so too have no-growth movements, restrictive local
zoning laws and other policies that constrain new-home construction.</TE>
<TE>   Demand soon outstrips supply. Since the mid-1970s, the U.S.
population has grown by more than 30%. During this time, the annual
rate of new housing starts fell from nearly 2.5 million units in 1975
to just 1.6 million in 2000, a 40% decline. The result: Average home
prices have soared.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer houses available for sale mean fewer families can afford to
buy a home, particularly in regions such as the western United
States, where strong population growth triggered strong anti-growth
reactions. In much of urban California, less than 40% of all
households can qualify for a home loan. The National Housing
Conference recently reported that one in seven households nationwide
are forced to spend more than 50% of their income for housing or live
in substandard facilities.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1990s, real estate wealth took on the same
upper-income skew typical of stocks and other financial assets.
Census data in 1995 indicated that the wealthiest 40% of U.S.
households owned more than 50% of the country's net equity in
residential real estate. The poorest 40% owned less than one-quarter.
This gap has almost certainly widened because average home prices
have jumped an additional 30%. Younger, working- and many
middle-class buyers are increasingly locked out of the U.S.
home-buying market.</TE>
<TE>   Equally troubling, the easy availability of cheap home-finance
capital can distort U.S. investment priorities. That wealthier
investors can tap home equity or refinance their mortgages to
neutralize stock market setbacks probably helped feed the irrational
Wall Street run-ups of the last 20 years. When the costs of being
wrong are reduced, people will invest more carelessly.</TE>
<TE>   An economy sustained by pricey homes may also grow in a
boom-and-bust pattern. This month, for example, government data
showed that San Jose, Seattle and San Francisco suffered the highest
year-to-year percentage job losses in the nation. Yet, because the
housing supply in these areas is extremely tight, home prices have
barely budged and remain almost double the national average.</TE>
<TE>   A region addicted to costly housing tends to gamble on bubble-like
economic development. More normal, balanced industrial growth doesn't
generate the income and stock windfalls needed to defray inflated
living expenses. The region's long-term economic vitality
correspondingly suffers.</TE>
<TE>   Government created, and now subsidizes, many of the key tools of
home finance to promote the worthy goals of homeownership and an
upwardly mobile society. But when the housing market is manipulated
to support economic extravagance, these goals are compromised. Can we
reclaim the government's original intent?</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the commitment to supply houses to the widest
range of citizens should be reaffirmed. Politically powerful
pressures to constrain new-home production can be overcome by
streamlining permitting processes and adding economic incentives for
new construction.</TE>
<TE>   Subsidizing tax-deductible mortgages for purposes unrelated to
housing should also be rethought. The nation's mortgage market and
tax system were built to facilitate homeownership, not provide
wealthy investors with another source of capital. One solution would
be to limit mortgage-interest deductibility to, say, adding a
bathroom on a house rather than taking an Alaskan cruise, buying a
BMW or gambling on dot-com ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Absent a concerted effort to return to the basic goals of
homeownership, the U.S. housing market could succumb to the same
speculative excesses that upended Wall Street.</TE>

<HD>State's Separate Systems for Rich and Poor</HD>
<DH>Students with the greatest need are most likely to be in
the schools with the biggest problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Louis Harris is a public opinion analyst.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If you want to know what's happening in California schools, just ask
the teachers. With a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, my
polling organization recently did just that, surveying 1,070 teachers
in the state's public schools to try to assess the state of public
education. What we found was disturbing, if not surprising:</LD>
<LD>   * 32% of California's 1.6 million public school students do not
have books necessary to do their homework.</LD>
<LD>   * 11% do not have enough textbooks to use at school.</LD>
<TE>   * 32% spend many days in classrooms either uncomfortably hot or
cold.</TE>
<TE>   * 27% attend schools with cockroaches, mice and rats.</TE>
<TE>   * 17% attend schools where bathrooms are not working or are
closed.</TE>
<TE>   Where are these problems most acute? In the 20% of schools with
the highest proportion of at-risk students, as judged by such markers
as poverty and limited English proficiency. In other words, students
with the greatest need are most likely to be in the schools with the
biggest problems. California, the teachers' answers suggest, has two
school systems: one for its most privileged students and another,
substantially worse, for its least privileged.</TE>
<TE>   Some examples: Only 11% of teachers in the 51% of California
schools that ranked lowest on our at-risk index reported serious
problems at their schools with teacher turnover. At the 20% of
schools deemed most at-risk, 48% of teachers reported
teacher-turnover problems. While 13% of teachers in the less at-risk
schools reported insufficient textbooks, 25% in the schools most
at-risk reported such problems. Substantial discrepancies between the
two groups were also reported for such things as working conditions,
restroom availability, availability of technology and the number of
classrooms staffed with non-credentialed teachers.</TE>
<TE>   We interviewed teachers because they are the best daily witnesses
to what is taking place in the classroom. Over the past 25 years, my
colleagues and I have conducted more than 40 studies centering on
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, for the Metropolitan Life Foundation, we
examined teacher attitudes toward school-based reform. Common wisdom
at the time was that teachers would be the last group to embrace
reform. To the contrary, we found that teachers were ready to make
personal sacrifices to see the reform agenda adopted in their
schools, something they later demonstrated when reforms came.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, in 1993, we did a national survey funded by the
Ford Foundation of 2000 teachers, half of them drawn from a national
cross section and half from teachers from inner-city schools. The
subject: How ready were teachers to take on the difficult job of
teaching in schools populated dominantly by African American, Latino
and other low-income ethnic children. We found a high degree of
willingness, especially among the 40% who taught in schools where a
school-based decision-making reform program was in effect.</TE>
<TE>   In California this spring, we used teachers in a totally new role:
as assessors and reporters of what is happening in the classrooms.
Our goal was to determine the extent to which all students in a given
state had an equal opportunity to obtain a quality education.
California was selected for the first survey.</TE>
<TE>   To determine which schools were most at-risk, we looked to the
California Board of Education Web site, which provides information on
each school in the state. The elements we used in determining at-risk
schools were what the percentage was in each school of students
receiving free or reduced-price lunches, how many students were
classified as "limited English proficient" and how many of the
students' families were enrolled in the Calworks program.</TE>
<TE>   But those statistics alone couldn't give a full picture of the
schools, which is why we turned to the teachers in order to see what
was actually happening on the campuses and in the classrooms. Each
teacher in the cross section answered an identical questionnaire.</TE>
<TE>   What we found was hardly a portrait of a bright and shining
learning environment for the most at-risk and disadvantaged children.
To provide them with run-down schools, unqualified teachers and
substandard facilities and materials is a sure formula for failure.
For California to survive in the long run, it must find a way of
making winners out of the current generation of all its young people.
This can only be done by properly educating all young people,
something that's simply not being done today in California today.</TE>

<DH>Both sides of the hill are places of value. Let's stop
bickering and take a good look at each other.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GALE HOLLAND</AU>
<BD>Gale Holland writes regularly for Opinion.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not long after my son began busing to a magnet school in the San
Fernando Valley, he came up against the vast psychic gulf that
divides Los Angeles' premier bedroom communities from the rest of the
city. My son's chorale group was invited to sing at a downtown hotel
convention, not far from our Echo Park home. The concert was a
success, but as we drove away, he wasn't smiling.</LD>
<LD>   "Why didn't you tell me we lived in the ghetto?" he demanded,
glowering.</LD>
<LD>   "What?" I asked, blindsided.</LD>
<TE>   It seemed that when the performers got off the freeway--at the
same exit my son's school bus took each day--several of the Valley
kids yelled. "We're in the ghetto!" Some slid down in their sticky
plastic seats so their heads wouldn't show in the bus windows; others
got on their cell phones, nervously describing what they saw as a
perilous vista to their parents back home.</TE>
<TE>   "Look! There's a gangster!" exclaimed one kid, pointing at what my
son described as a nondescript Latino man, conspicuously free of
thug-style jewelry or clothing.</TE>
<TE>   My son eventually learned to shrug off the students' ignorance
about his more urban neighborhood, which after all was just a
reflection of what they had heard from adults and the media. But now,
that same ignorance threatens to blow the city apart.</TE>
<TE>   A proposal for Valley secession is heading for the November
ballot, and many people in both the Valley and the rest of the city,
who also have a vote, apparently support it. The plan is to make the
Valley into a new city of 1.35 million people, the sixth-largest in
the United States; the remaining Los Angeles, at 2.35 million, would
slip from No. 2 to No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Astonishingly, secessionists are billing the breakup as a bid for
smaller, more efficient and responsive government. I keep waiting for
this howler to show up on "The Tonight Show" monologue--only in Los
Angeles could you sell a city of 1.35 million as small and
responsive. Has anybody talked to Phoenix, the current No. 6, about
small and responsive? How about No. 7, Detroit? Is that the kind of
cozy little town hall meeting, Welcome Wagon kind of place they
envision becoming?</TE>
<TE>   Even the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which is
overseeing the secession process, noted in its report that
small-government efficiencies tend to vanish at the
20,000-to-50,000-population watermark. So what is really going on
here? Let us put aside for the moment the motives of secession
organizers, the termed-out politicians looking for
somewhere--anywhere--to get elected, the local businesses grasping at
a financial windfall. Let's look at the story line secessionists are
trying to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The basic theme is that Los Angeles is a burnt-out shell, sucking
wealth from the gleaming suburbs over the hill. With some kind of
weird "Green Acres" mentality, secessionists tar all us big-city folk
with the same brush. Whenever I hear pro-secession forces talk about
Los Angeles, I picture a cartoon thought bubble above their heads
containing a sunken ship, its crumbling bones crawling with poisonous
sea slugs and ink-squirting giant squid. Secessionists see themselves
as winners and us as losers. Secession opponents haven't done anyone
any favors by acting like a Valley breakaway would be a disaster for
the remaining city. That just reinforces the idea that we're dead
weight.</TE>
<TE>   Before you accuse me of being an anti-Valley snob, let me say I
grew up in North Hollywood--or as the Valley, with unintended irony,
now dubs my neighborhood, Valley Village. I've been called a Valley
Girl more times than I can count. I shop in the Valley, hike there,
go to movies and visit friends.</TE>
<TE>   During my childhood, we had our over-the-hill prejudices. The only
time I remember visiting South-Central Los Angeles was to see the
Watts Towers. But visit the Watts Towers we did. And the Miracle
Mile, downtown Los Angeles, Olvera Street, the Farmers Market, the
Fairfax district and Hollywood. My parents were from a small
Midwestern city. In the Valley, they found a nice place to raise a
family, but it was important to them that they were part of the city
as well. Otherwise, why leave Missouri? I can still remember my
mother's contempt when salesmen would try to get her to switch her
newspaper subscription to the suburban paper.</TE>
<TE>   Most Valley people today rarely sally forth into the other Los
Angeles, unless they work here. Of course, the Valley has evolved,
economically, culturally and in every other way. I have no doubt one
can live a perfectly delightful life without ever venturing south on
the 101 Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   But the Valley's insularity renders its voters ill-equipped to
decide the secession question. I presume secession backers realize
they'll be losing Bel-Air, Pacific Palisades and Brentwood. But what
about Beverlywood, a shady mid-city enclave that resembles nothing so
much as the Valley? Or West Adams, a tightknit neighborhood of
classic Craftsman-style homes that have been renovated into little
gems? Or Silver Lake, a hillside hideaway that shields the doctors'
mansions of Pill Hill and landmark architecture by Richard Nuetra?
The Baldwin Hills? Do they even know these neighborhoods exist--and
contribute to the tax base as generously as Encino and Tarzana, maybe
more so?</TE>
<TE>   Sure, we have our urban blight, but so does the Valley. Our highs
and lows may be more spectacular, but we are not that different. It's
a sign of how deep misconceptions run that this point must be made,
but here it is: We are truly one city. The Economic Roundtable, in a
1999 study of the Los Angeles labor market, described how employment
and commerce zones ride roughshod across the L.A./ Valley divide.</TE>
<TE>   "We can think of the 'space economy' of the City of Los Angeles as
divided into (a) service areas that extend westward from downtown Los
Angeles on either side of the Hollywood Hills and Santa Monica
Mountains, to Westside Los Angeles and the south San Fernando Valley,
and (b) manufacturing areas that extend south of downtown Los Angeles
to the Harbor, and northwest of downtown into the north San Fernando
Valley," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular perception, the LAFCO secession report
concluded nothing about the long-term economic viability of either
the new Valley municipality or the city that would be left behind.
Nor does it analyze the impact--good or bad--of secession on the
local economy. Its only real topic is how to split the city's booty.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAFCO report made only a cursory analysis of impact on Los
Angeles," says Raphael Sonenshein, a Cal State Fullerton political
scientist. "I don't think anybody really knows what it will be."</TE>
<TE>   So who is the winner if the city divorces? No one, it turns out.</TE>
<TE>   "Economically, the two cities would be about the same, to be quite
frank," Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp., says of the entities that would be
created by secession. "The remaining city would be very, very viable.
Some areas are seeing a renaissance--the Fairfax district, the Grove
at the Farmers Market, a lot of new projects downtown.... People look
at the Valley and flash back to the old myths that it's all suburbia,
but in fact the Valley is very, very diverse. There are very lovely
residential areas, but in the northeast parts of Van Nuys, there is
economic decay."</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters have seized on the similarities between the
Valley and the rest of Los Angeles to argue that, unlike every other
secession movement that ever was, they are not rich white
suburbanites fleeing a decaying, multiethnic inner city. But their
argument is not only disingenuous, it misses the point. Why secede at
all? It's easy to think of reasons not to. Los Angeles stands to lose
in its sure grip on Pacific Rim and global economic leadership.
Bereft of a major airport, port, research universities, water, sewer
and utilities infrastructure--the list goes on--it's hard to see how
the Valley would be perceived as anything more than another suburban
sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   And what's the good part again? Where are the economic advantages,
either in the Valley or beyond? Secessionists have failed to make any
sustainable economic case for secession, relying on our ignorance to
win the day.</TE>
<TE>   Before we let that happen, let's take a good look at one another.
This weekend, I promise to drive to Northridge if someone in the
Valley will come to Koreatown. Or Carthay Circle. Or View Park. Let's
see if we can't find some common ground. Otherwise, we risk marching
in a state of perfect ignorance into a municipal perfect storm.</TE>

<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>At their meeting here this week, President Bush and Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin can take a dramatic step toward a new U.S.-Russian
partnership by building upon a revolution in the geopolitics of
Eurasia that has been rapidly unfolding since Sept. 11. Coming on the
heels of last week's agreements to cut nuclear arsenals and create a
NATO-Russia council, burgeoning cooperation on Eurasian security
could transform U.S.-Russian relations.</LD>
<LD>   For centuries, Russia has dominated Central Asia and the Caucasus,
all the while warning Western powers to steer clear. But Moscow is
backing off. The U.S. military now has footholds in Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Georgia, all a direct result of America's
war on terrorism. Bases in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have
facilitated U.S. operations in Afghanistan; U.S. troops in Georgia
will help prepare forces there to attack terrorists in the country's
lawless Pankisi Gorge. Remarkably, U.S. forces have arrived under
Russia's approving eye.</LD>
<TE>   The motivations behind Moscow's cooperation go well beyond the
fight against terrorism. Putin's welcome of U.S. forces into Russia's
backyard is part of a profound shift in his country's policy toward
its neighbors. Before Putin, Moscow worked hard to limit Western
influence in the former Soviet republics, saw Russia as the sole
arbiter of regional disputes and showed interest in reconstituting an
imperial zone. In contrast, Putin's policy is based on economic
pragmatism and recognition that Russia would pay too high a price for
seeking to retain tight control over its periphery.</TE>
<TE>   Economic reconstruction of Russia is Putin's key goal, and foreign
policy is to serve this end. His increased respect for the
sovereignty of Russia's smaller neighbors and his willingness to
offer the West more economic and strategic access to Central Asia and
the Caucasus follow logically.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian president has gradually implemented his policy since
2000. Russia has dropped its opposition to the U.S.-backed
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, which would bring Caspian oil to the
international market without crossing Russian territory. Russian
companies are vying to participate in the project. In peace talks
over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, Moscow
has allowed Western countries to become influential partners in
mediation. Russia also is withdrawing from many of its military bases
across the region, fully aware that its presence is expensive and
strains relations with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In orchestrating this about-face, Putin continues to encounter
opposition from the military and others in the Russian elite, but his
commanding political power has enabled him to prevail. Russia's
interest in countering the terrorist threat from Central Asia and the
Caucasus has strengthened Putin's pragmatic hand. As Alexei G.
Arbatov, a leading defense expert in the Duma, or lower house of
parliament, recently remarked, "Either Islamic terrorists operate
there freely, or an American political and military presence begins
building up. Since Russia today is unable, unfortunately, to
liquidate hotbeds of terrorism on its own, there is no other choice."</TE>
<TE>   This evolution in Russian policy represents a remarkably rapid
decline in Russia's residual imperial mind-set. The Soviet Union
existed only 11 years ago, and Russia is Eurasia's dominant state,
tempting it to encroach upon its weaker neighbors. Nonetheless,
Moscow is retreating from decades of reliance on coercion and
intimidation to sustain a sphere of influence, a momentous shift that
opens up opportunities for the U.S. to develop a regional partnership
with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The new U.S.-Russia partnership should focus on shared strategic,
political and economic objectives. Fulfilling its strategic goals
would entail a long-term U.S. military presence in Central Asia, a
prospect most Russian elites privately support. The U.S. would use
these bases to continue the fight against terrorism, of particular
importance in light of the questionable future of U.S. access to
bases in Saudi Arabia. The bases would also help combat Islamic
radicals in the region who are reportedly funneling arms and money to
Palestinian extremists. In addition, the U.S. would use its foothold
in Central Asia to work with Moscow to limit China's growing
influence--Beijing's intentions are of deep concern to Russian
elites--and to manage conflict between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The political goal of a U.S.-Russian partnership would be to
promote stability among the fragile states of Central Asia and the
Caucasus. Many of these countries have weak domestic institutions and
tenuous national identities; a corrupting drug trade further
compromises the functioning of the state. Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan are governed by elderly, autocratic
leaders and face potential crises over leadership succession.
Georgia's government has teetered on the edge of collapse and does
not control major portions of the country. The United States and
Russia should focus joint diplomacy on preserving the territorial
integrity of these countries, ensuring smooth leadership transitions
and enhancing efforts to fight drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   The fragility of these states also increases the possibility that
they could serve as terrorist havens. Extremists are already
operating in Georgia. The United States should continue
anti-terrorism training, increase efforts to improve the quality of
domestic governance and press the government to take stronger steps
against terrorists. The Russians should play a more constructive role
in resolving the country's separatist conflicts and should stop
strong-arming Georgia through tactics such as threatening to cut off
gas supplies.</TE>
<TE>   On the economic front, the U.S. and Russia can work together to
encourage development and reform throughout the region, the best
insurance against both political instability and the spread of
fundamentalism among Central Asia's substantial Muslim population.
Washington should seek to attract private investment to the area, a
goal made easier by a U.S. military presence. The U.S. also should
direct more foreign assistance to Central Asia, but without falling
into the Cold War trap of providing aid directly to autocrats
uninterested in economic reform or political liberalization. Instead,
Washington should channel aid to the grass-roots level, supporting
and nurturing new ideas among the next generation of leaders through
educational exchanges, training programs and in-country projects that
bypass the central government.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Russian government does not have the resources to
contribute financial assistance, it can take important steps to
stimulate growth in the region. Moscow should ease new visa
restrictions on Georgians, enabling them to again find work in Russia
and send back home their earnings. The Russians should drop barriers
on imports of Central Asian agricultural products. Moscow can use the
growing economic clout stemming from its oil production to champion
the development of Central Asia in international lending institutions
and among Arab and Asian donors. And the U.S. and Russia must work
together to tap the Caspian Basin's major oil reserves, enhancing the
region's prosperity, bringing income to Russia's energy industry and
diversifying the West's oil supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Many issues will continue to divide the United States and Russia.
But in Central Asia and the Caucasus, American and Russian objectives
now closely coincide. Neither Washington nor Moscow can afford to
overlook this opportunity to bring welcome stability to Eurasia's
southern rim while opening the door to a new level of cooperation.</TE>

<AU>MARK LEE</AU>
<BD>Mark Lee's new novel, "The Canal House," will be

<DL></DL>
<LD>Traveling through the rugged mountains of East Timor in March, my car
got stuck in the middle of a river. The back wheels spun around
uselessly, then the engine died, but my driver, Afonso Martins,
wasn't worried. "Someone will come," he announced. Ten minutes later,
the car had filled up with water and we crawled out onto the hood.
"Someone will come," he repeated. A few minutes later, a dump truck
showed up driven by Martins' cousin's best friend. As we were towed
out of the water, I remarked that it was lucky to find such a
connection in the middle of nowhere. Martins was amused. "If we
stayed in this river, we'd meet my whole family."</LD>
<LD>   That's how East Timor is. About the size of Connecticut, on
one-half of an island in the Indonesian archipelago north of
Australia, the whole country has a population of just
800,000--significantly fewer people than would be in the new San
Fernando Valley city if it secedes. Village life is traditional, and
people know their neighbors intimately. If you get stuck in a stream,
you'll probably know the next person who comes down the road, which
is both a benefit and a challenge for the East Timorese as they
attempt to move beyond the past into a new era.</LD>
<TE>   Monday, in a ceremony attended by former President Clinton, East
Timor will declare itself fully independent, something it has not
been for more than 400 years, except for a few chaotic days in 1975
when it declared itself a country after the end of Portuguese
colonial rule. With few objections from the U.S. and Australian
governments, Indonesia almost immediately sent in troops and seized
control, annexing it the following year. For the next 24 years,
guerrillas in the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East
Timor--widely known as Fretilin--battled the Indonesian army. It's
impossible to find an East Timorese person who did not lose a friend
or family member during this period.</TE>
<TE>   When political changes in Indonesia allowed for a 1999 referendum,
more than 90% of East Timor's people voted for independence. But in
the weeks that followed, the Indonesians and a variety of militias,
whose East Timorese members had acted as death squads for the
Indonesians, burned down 80% of the country's buildings and forced
more than 250,000 people to cross the border to the province of West
Timor.</TE>
<TE>   Now that things have settled down and East Timor will finally
become fully independent, there is widespread cause for rejoicing as
close-knit communities rebuild. But there is also bitter
resentment--particularly toward the East Timorese militia members who
now are attempting to re-integrate into those communities.</TE>
<TE>   During the final decade of Indonesian rule, the militia burned
down countless homes and killed, tortured or raped people suspected
of supporting the Fretilin guerrillas. Many of the destroyed homes
still stand, their soot-covered walls and twisted metal roofs serving
as a constant reminder of the past. Traveling through the countryside
recently, I quickly discovered how everyone remembers who burned down
another person's home five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Domingos Soares, a muscular, bearded man of 49, led a militia in
Letefoho, a small town in the mountains south of Dili. After fleeing
across the border to West Timor, he has now returned to his home,
where we spoke. At first, convinced that I was some kind of official
investigating war crimes, he held his body tightly and stared at the
ground. Yes, he was a commandante in the militia. Yes, he burned down
people's homes.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, he relaxed and began to speak more freely. "When the
[Indonesian military] came to me, they said, 'You are a friend, so
make a [militia]. If you are not our friend, then you are our
enemy,'" Soares said, looking embarrassed and shrugging his shoulders
as if to indicate that he had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   Right after his return, he said, "I was very frightened." His
neighbors all knew he had been part of a militia. "Then the priest
talks about me in church and a man from Fretilin also talks about me.
They say, 'The fighting is over. Our children need peace.'"</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, though, finds it easy to forgive. Moises Dos Santos,
56, was on the other side in the long conflict, a village leader in
Liquica, a coastal village south of the capital. He watched as local
farmers were organized and given guns by the Indonesian army. The new
militiamen were told that they would be paid 25,000 Indonesian rupiah
(about $2.50) and a bag of rice for every person they killed. In
1999, Dos Santos was hiding in the fields near the local church when
the militia executed his aunt. Now many of these people have
returned, and Dos Santos sees them selling fruit by the side of the
road.</TE>
<TE>   "When I see [former militia members] it is difficult to put my
anger down," he said recently. "I want to be responsible, but...." He
made a fist and thumped his chest: "My heart is still hard."</TE>
<TE>   For East Timor to move forward, the legal and personal issues of
reconciliation must be addressed, which is why they have now been
incorporated into official government policy.</TE>
<TE>   An independent Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation
has been organized, and it recently started its activities. The
commission will investigate human rights violations during the last
25 years and determine which individuals were responsible. Serious
crimes--such as murder or torture--will be referred to the country's
new justice system. Other offenses, such as theft, arson or the
killing of livestock, will require the perpetrator to perform "an act
of reconciliation," such as a period of community service or a public
apology.</TE>
<TE>   Aniceto Guterres, a 35-year-old lawyer and human rights activist,
heads the reconciliation commission. He knows he has a difficult job.
"We can have reconciliation if the East Timorese people have faith in
the rule of law," he said. "They must believe that past crimes will
be handled fairly by the legal system."</TE>
<TE>   East Timor is 95% Roman Catholic, and Guterres believes that the
church must have an active role in the process of reconciliation.
"Religion is very important here and not in an abstract way," he
explained. "The church leaders are often the leaders of the
community."</TE>
<TE>   During the months before independence, Carlos Ximenes Belo, the
Timorese bishop who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, has traveled
across the country telling people to avoid vigilante justice and
trust the new government. But even as the new government and the
church press for national reconciliation, people here realize that
East Timor's future will be determined in the villages. When the
once-feared militia members return without their weapons, thousands
of people will make private decisions to forgive or seek revenge.</TE>
<TE>   On the day I visited the town of Zumalai, near the border, Father
Augusto Sampio and his parishioners were making preparations for 51
ex-militia members to return for a brief visit. This would be the
third time the group had traveled across the border for a one-day
event. Father Augusto planned to preach a sermon, several of the
militia members would make public apologies, and then members of the
community would ask the exiles to return with their families.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Mass, I will explain that the Indonesians wanted to
divide us into two groups," the priest said. "Then I tell everyone
that the people who died were a sacrifice so that our nation could
appear."</TE>
<TE>   Will this process lead to reconciliation? Father Augusto gazed
across the packed-dirt yard in front of his church at the children
walking home from school for the midday meal. "I pray," the priest
whispered. "I pray."</TE>

<AU>JO-ANN MORT</AU>
<BD>Jo-Ann Mort is co-author (with Gary Brenner) of the
forthcoming "Our Hearts Invented a Place: Can Kibbutzim Survive the
New Israel?" and national secretary of Americans for Peace Now.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the "strange bedfellows" department, one of the oddest pairings on
the current political scene is American Jews and the Christian right.
Yes, both groups back Israel. But their long-term visions for its
future are miles apart.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the following quotation from the Web site of Pat
Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, a strong supporter of
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's recent actions: "Indeed, there
will finally be such a fullness of Israel when their hardness and
blindness to the gospel is overcome as to vastly enrich the whole
world. For the almost unbelievable truth is that all Israel will be
saved. The fullness of Gentiles will climax with the fullness of
Israel." It's hard to believe that this vision of an Israel in which
all the Jews convert to Christianity is compatible with the vision
for Israel held by most Jews.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that non-Jewish support in the U.S. for Israel is
something new--think Pete Seeger or the Weavers singing "Kumbaya."
But there has been a seismic shift in the makeup of that support. It
used to be progressive non-Jewish Americans who strongly backed
Israel. Now Israel's best friends here are people like former
Christian Coalition Executive Director Ralph Reed (who now heads the
Georgia Republican Party) and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas).</LD>
<TE>   The Anti-Defamation League even went to the extreme of reprinting
as an advertisement in the New York Times and other newspapers an
article titled "We People of Faith Stand Firmly With Israel" that
Reed wrote for The Los Angeles Times. Is this the same ADL that has
as its cornerstone fighting bigotry, supporting civil rights and
maintaining separation between church and state?</TE>
<TE>   If Jews feel mainstream media coverage of Israel is biased,
perhaps they ought to protest by watching a network that gives plenty
of positive coverage to Israel: Robertson's Christian Broadcasting
Network. Of course, the network's vision of Israel may make many Jews
uncomfortable. As another article on its Web site proclaims: "Thus
Jews, Israel, will eventually--and supernaturally--witness to the
gospel, and with such explosive power that the world can scarcely be
the same! Ah, there is God's future for ethnic Israel."</TE>
<TE>   In some sense, this Christian fundamentalism is a mirror image of
the Jewish fundamentalism contained within the Sharon government.
While Sharon himself is a secular hawk, he has survived in politics
since 1967 as the patron of the settlers, the hard core of whom are
religious fanatics--and not only in their desire to control the
biblical land of Israel that includes all of what they call "Judea
and Samaria" or "Greater Israel." The most extreme among them also
hold all of the modern democratic institutions of the state--from the
Supreme Court to parliamentary democracy--in contempt. They yearn for
a land of Israel fashioned in the image of the ancient kingdom of
David, as opposed to the modern, pluralistic, forward-looking state
Israel is today.</TE>
<TE>   The newest member of Sharon's Cabinet is the head of the National
Religious Party, Effi Eitam, a former Israeli army brigadier general
who was refused higher promotion within the army because of his harsh
treatment of Palestinians. Eitam, a "born-again" Jew, is a former
secular kibbutz member transformed into a messianic Jew, much along
the lines of other Religious Party settlers who saw the post-1967 era
in Israel more as the fulfillment of biblical dictate than as a move
to meet Israel's security needs.</TE>
<TE>   Eitam, who has declared that he will be the first "kippa-wearing"
prime minister (wearing a kippa, or yarmulke, denotes religious
observance), is an ultrareligious Jew with fiercely undemocratic
values. He believes not only in dealing ruthlessly with Palestinians
across the 1967 Green Line but he says that the Israeli Arab citizens
who reside within Israel's pre-1967 borders should be transferred
out. He would do well with his counterparts in the United States, but
his beliefs would most likely find little support among the bulk of
Jews in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the U.S. Yet it is this point of
view--in Israel and the U.S.--that is being strengthened by an
alliance that supports Sharon, right or wrong.</TE>
<TE>   As if the Christian right's vision of Israel weren't alien enough
to the Israel most American Jews desire, a second result of this
newfound alliance is the strengthening of the right wing's resolve
within the current U.S. political landscape. The alliance of the
Christian right, the neoconservative intellectuals (many of whom are
Jewish) who long ago gave up on the Democrats and the more mainstream
Jewish organizations has strengthened the resolve of the Bush
administration to say yes to almost anything Sharon is doing. But it
has also strengthened the ability of the conservatives to push
through an American agenda that both runs counter to the will of the
majority of American Jews and could even endanger American Jewish
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Rove, Bush's political eyes and ears, has made it his role to
be sure that Bush junior doesn't suffer the same fate as his father.
In order to cement a two-term presidency, Rove is shoring up a
conservative domestic agenda for the president. Now he has the aid of
liberal American Jews.</TE>

<AU>RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.</AU>
<BD>Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated
columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group and a member of the
Dallas Morning News editorial board.</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>How frustrating for President Bush to watch fellow Republicans
squander gains with Latino voters through mistakes and missed
opportunities. And how maddening that some of those Republicans live
in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   While the exact figure is still disputed, Bush got somewhere
between one-third and one-half of the Latino vote in his 1998
reelection as Texas governor. He made those inroads by giving Latinos
the respect of aggressively courting their support.</LD>
<LD>   Back then, it was the national GOP that couldn't comprehend the
Latino-based offensive at the state level. As far as many Republicans
in Washington were concerned, Latinos were nonconvertible Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   Today, the roles are reversed. President Bush has put out the
word, time and again, that being a "compassionate conservative"
means, among other things, making Latinos and other minorities feel
welcome in the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   House Republicans seem to have gotten the message. Under pressure
from the administration, they recently voted, albeit in a nonbinding
motion, to restore eligibility for food stamps to hundreds of
thousands of legal immigrants cut off under the 1996 welfare reform
law.</TE>
<TE>   Now, strangely enough, the breakdown in communication seems to be
at the state level, where Republicans are falling back into old
habits.</TE>
<TE>   In California, gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. told a radio
talk show host in February that if he were elected, he would have his
"legal experts look at" revisiting Proposition 187, a successful 1994
ballot initiative that sought to restrict illegal immigrants' access
to government benefits (it was later largely struck down by the
courts), and would station National Guard troops on the
California-Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   The president had to do damage control. During a recent meeting
with Latino and African American leaders in South-Central Los
Angeles, Bush showed his compassionate conservative side and
distanced himself from Simon's pro-Proposition 187 stance with
assurances that he was, as always, "totally supportive of immigrants,
their rights and their enormous contributions." As Texas governor,
Bush thwarted the launching of a Proposition 187-type measure in his
state and emphasized his support of bilingual education programs that
work.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, there is more damage to control. It seems that
Republicans, in the game of racial inclusion, like playing offense
more than defense. An aide to John Cornyn, Republican U.S. Senate
candidate and state attorney general, dismissed the Democrats'
celebrated "dream ticket"--a Latino candidate for governor, an
African American for U.S. Senate and an Anglo for lieutenant
governor--as a "racial quota ticket." Cornyn apologized.</TE>
<TE>   As well he should have. Republicans don't use words like "quota"
by accident. This is the same party that tries to convince white
males that they are victimized by a racial spoils system that
includes affirmative action and quotas. When a Republican pulls a
stunt like that, the inference is that the two nonwhites on the
Democratic dream ticket--gubernatorial candidate A.R. "Tony" Sanchez
Jr. and Senate candidate Ron Kirk--are less qualified than the three
white males running under the GOP banner. But Sanchez and Kirk won
their party's nominations only after bruising contests with primary
opponents. All three Republican nominees either ran unopposed or
faced only token opposition. So, who's qualified?</TE>
<TE>   For an encore, Texas Republican Party Chairwoman Susan Weddington
decided that a good way to get in the good graces of Texas Latinos
was to go after one of their icons: Henry G. Cisneros. Since
returning to Texas, the former San Antonio mayor and U.S. housing
secretary has launched a voter registration project. The EVERY Texan
Foundation Inc. aims to register at least 500,000 new voters for this
year's general election, many of them Latinos and African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Weddington considers the voter registration project a political
front for Democrats. She even registered a formal complaint with the
Internal Revenue Service, asking for a review of the nonprofit
organization's tax-exempt status. Weddington was reportedly incensed
that Cisneros, in selecting a speaker for a recent $1,000-a-plate
Houston fund-raiser for the group, chose former President Clinton.
She wasn't mollified by Cisneros' claim that former President Bush
had also been invited to address the group.</TE>
<TE>   Weddington should take a long look at the ugly history of
Republican-driven efforts to suppress the minority vote in and out of
Texas. From poll watchers in the 1950s to allegations of voter fraud
in immigrant communities in the 1990s, Republicans have repeatedly
sent the message that they would prefer that Latinos and African
Americans simply stay home on election day. That is the same message
Weddington sent by going to the IRS. She foolishly advanced the
perception that Texas Republicans are running scared. Why not just
unfurl a banner at GOP headquarters in Austin announcing that
Republicans are terrified of new minority voters rushing to the polls
because the GOP has nothing new to say to them?</TE>
<TE>   That is a strange concession coming from Bush country, named after
a leader who aggressively solicits the votes of minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who wants to have it both
ways. While eager to replicate Bush's success with Latino voters,
Perry seems worried about alienating the GOP base of conservative
whites. He likely realizes that many Republicans are nervous about
racial politics and might turn against any candidate who tries to
beat the Democrats at their own game.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, while attending a Dallas business conference, Perry took
exception to a reporter's suggestion that he could not expect to win
much of the Latino vote, given that he has to contend with an
opponent named Sanchez. The governor suggested that Texans will cast
their lots based on experience and qualifications, not on a
candidate's ethnicity. In fact, Perry said there was no place in this
election for ethnic politics or any attempt to play to Texans along
racial lines.</TE>
<TE>   It was a lovely sentiment. And it might even have been persuasive
if not for one small detail: Perry had just made an ethnic pitch to a
conference designed to promote Latino businesses.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone can sympathize with Perry's predicament, it is White
House officials. President Bush is in a similar fix, namely, how to
be a good team captain by supporting the GOP ticket in Texas without
pooh-poohing diversity like his comrades. So, Bush kept mum--until
recently, when, in an interview with a Dallas television reporter, he
waded into the political fray. Bush implied that Kirk, if elected to
the Senate, would be an "obstructionist." He also tagged Sanchez, a
former Bush contributor who has recently appeared to reverse himself
on several issues, a clumsy campaigner apt to make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Bush may have decided to break his silence in the Texas races when
news reports disclosed that Mark McKinnon, Bush's chief media advisor
in the 2000 presidential campaign, made contributions to several
Democratic candidates in Texas, including Kirk.</TE>
<TE>   The president should have known better. Texas politics don't
follow national blueprints.</TE>

<HD>A Plan to Save Our Schools</HD>

once-excellent schools the object of national scorn.</DH>

<AU>JEANNIE OAKES</AU>
<BD>Jeannie Oakes is presidential professor in UCLA's
Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. A draft of the
new master plan can be found on the Internet at
www.sen.ca.gov/masterplan/whatsnew.htp.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1960, a tidal wave of baby boomers was crashing through the
state's K-12 system toward college, and higher education was totally
unprepared. State policymakers could have patched together remedies
that would ease the crisis while doing little to elevate the quality
and ranking of the state's colleges and universities. Instead, led by
then-UC President Clark Kerr, they crafted a visionary master plan.</LD>
<LD>   The plan's promise was revolutionary: All California high school
graduates could have a low-cost college education. Its ingenious
blueprint laid out a coordinated, three-tier system of community
colleges, California State University and University of California
campuses to produce highly trained scholars, educated citizens and a
well-prepared workforce. Gov. Pat Brown declared: "This is the most
significant step California has ever taken in planning for the
education of our youth."</LD>
<LD>   Across the state, citizens were similarly inspired and energized.
In the following decades they transformed California's universities
and colleges into the finest system of public higher education in the
world while providing a college education to the largest and most
diverse group of students ever. Today, despite the state's dramatic
economic, political and demographic shifts, California's colleges and
universities remain remarkably robust.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of California's education system has not fared so well.
Since Proposition 13 capped property taxes in 1978, drying up the
flow of local tax dollars to public schools, California's K-12
schools have declined precipitously. The state has assumed a larger
funding role, but funding has not begun to keep pace with inflation,
and with state money has come more state control of spending. For two
decades, state officials--prodded by lobbyists and other interest
groups--have layered policy on top of policy, program on top of
program, regulation on top of regulation. Put bluntly, the state
created a labyrinth for school districts to navigate to secure a
share of a capricious resource base.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a second tidal wave of young people has hit California's
schools. This time, it is the K-12 system that cannot cope.
Incoherent policies and under-funding have made our once-excellent
schools the object of national scorn. We have elaborate educational
standards, but no guarantees that students have the resources and
opportunities needed to meet them. Detailed rules dictate which
textbooks schools can buy, but nothing requires that schools provide
textbooks at all. Complex requirements govern who can teach, but
loopholes allow thousands of uncertified people to teach each year.
The accountability system--made up of an "off the shelf" test that
doesn't match the state's content standards--lacks the information
parents and policymakers need to fix the problems that keep students
from learning.</TE>
<TE>   The overall mess has meant that some good ideas have had
disastrous consequences. Take the state's requirement for a 20-1
student-to-teacher ratio in some grades. It is a good idea,
basically, but because it requires many more teachers, the state's
class-size-reduction initiative turned a serious shortage of
qualified teachers into a full-fledged crisis. It triggered an exodus
of qualified teachers from schools in poor communities into more
advantaged ones that offer better working conditions. Many schools
serving the most vulnerable children have been left with fewer than
half of their teachers certified.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps now there is a chance to reintroduce some sanity to K-12
schooling. Facing a challenge even more daunting than that of 1960,
the Legislature this year has set out to extend the reach and promise
of its master plan to the entire public education system. A joint
Senate and Assembly committee led by state Sen. Dede Alpert (D-San
Diego) charged dozens of civic leaders, academics, businesspeople,
educators, parents and other ordinary Californians to study and
recommend a new master plan for bringing the state's schools,
colleges and universities into a cohesive system--from kindergarten
through all levels of the university experience and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Former UC President Kerr, now in his early 90s, wished the
Legislature well: "We had a golden moment in the 1960s, and we made a
lot of progress in creating greater equality of opportunity and a
better economic system.... And now we face this choice: Are we going
to continue the suicidal course of the last 20 years or are we going
to move in the direction of paradise regained? That depends
tremendously on the report that your committee is going to turn out."</TE>
<TE>   Released last week, the first draft of that report awaits the
scrutiny of the Legislature and the public. The new master plan,
which I helped draft, contains more than 50 recommendations that
would revamp our schools in the service of splendid goals: universal
access to preschool; a qualified and inspiring teacher in every
classroom; a rigorous curriculum that will prepare all students for
success in postsecondary education, work and society; adequate
learning support services; and uncrowded physical learning
environments that are safe, well equipped and well maintained.
Already it has sparked education officials to begin analyzing the
state's bulky and sometimes irrational education code to see how it
would fit--or not fit--with the plan.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks ahead, much debate and lobbying will likely focus on
narrow provisions of the proposed plan. This is to be expected.
Undoubtedly, we will hear the familiar assertions that the
recommendations undermine local control, add stifling regulation, are
too costly and so on. Many will claim to support the new plan in
principle but then try to "fix" it by dismantling its recommendations
in ways that protect old interests. The sausage-like policymaking
process will try to accommodate by grinding the draft's tough-minded
recommendations into more palatable platitudes. Much will be
negotiated and changed.</TE>
<TE>   The current draft is not, of course, flawless. Particularly
troubling is the suggestion that the California Constitution be
amended to eliminate state responsibility in some areas, leaving
children with nowhere to turn when their local districts fail them.</TE>
<TE>   However, three tough-minded structural changes at the heart of the
plan must not be compromised. These are what will transform
California's K-12 schools, much as the earlier master plan
transformed higher education.</TE>
<TE>   First, the plan advocates "Opportunity to Learn Standards" that
specify what government agencies--the state and school
districts--must provide all schools. These standards spell out the
educational essentials that many California students now lack: a
qualified teacher, a curriculum aligned with the state's standards,
enough texts and materials for both classroom use and homework, clean
and safe learning environments and so forth. It's simply unthinkable
that California doesn't have such standards already.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the master plan restructures the accountability system to
make the adults in the system--from the governor on down--answerable
to children and communities, rather than vice versa. The performance
of these adults would be measured and reported each year in an
"Opportunity to Learn Index" that would complement the state's
Academic Performance Index, which measures student performance at
each school. Rather than judging students (and their schools) only by
the number of correct answers students "bubble in" on standardized
tests, students' learning will be linked to what they had a chance to
learn--what their teachers taught, and under what conditions their
learning took place. The independently elected state superintendent
would become the accountability watchdog, providing the public with
the information it needs to hold state agencies, school districts and
schools accountable for providing what teachers and students need to
teach and learn. Parents and communities would have ways to act when
the system fails.</TE>
<TE>   Third, the new master plan replaces an impossibly irrational
education finance structure with a model that begins with the actual
costs of high-quality schooling. In place of more than 70
categorically funded programs, a "California Quality Education Model"
would spell out the critical components of an education based upon
rigorous state standards and the funding needed to provide a quality
education to every student. This model won't end the politicking over
each year's education budget. However, it would allow legislators to
focus more on the big picture of quality education rather than giving
exclusive and myopic attention to individual programs.</TE>
<TE>   Most people will wonder how the state could possibly undertake
such radical change at the same time it's trying to close a
$20-billion budget gap. By borrowing against the future and some
draconian cuts elsewhere, Gov. Gray Davis preserved--if only
barely--the funding guaranteed to the state's public schools in 1988
by Proposition 98. Yet if the current crisis says anything, it says
that the educational system can't be left to the vagaries of economic
swings and political maneuvering. This governor has spared K-12
education, but another might not have.</TE>
<TE>   Now is the moment for the state to take its lead from the smartest
and toughest businesses, which in hard economic times reexamine their
goals and operations to maximize productivity and ensure a vital
future. It's not that this plan won't cost--it certainly will, just
as the 1960 master plan did. But Californians have shown themselves
willing to spend on education when they're confident the money is
being well spent, and the plan offers a map for investing in
well-thought-out ways, many of which will cost less in dollars than
in brainpower and courage.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Alpert and state legislators need to hear from Californians.
Tell them not to squander this moment. Remind them that the record is
clear: When California has kept its educational promises, its
students have met the state's highest hopes for their learning. This
was and remains the story of California's system of higher education.
Likewise, when and where California's will and educational
infrastructure slacken, student performance suffers. The 1960 master
plan made promises and showed how Californians could deliver on those
promises. It's time for California to promise and deliver again.</TE>

<LD>When Aaron Kennedy and Lydia Alvarez were preparing for their
wedding, they added home shopping to their plans. For Kennedy, who is
in law enforcement, safety was a top priority. On her list, Alvarez
had good schools, parks-and-recreation opportunities, and quiet but
friendly neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   The couple found everything they were looking for in the
two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium they purchased for $123,900
shortly before their November 2000 wedding in Chino Hills, a
fast-growing enclave on 46 square miles at the southwest corner of
San Bernardino County.</LD>
<LD>   Well, almost everything.</LD>
<TE>   "Chino Hills just isn't a good place for restaurants," Alvarez
said. "We have to go to Anaheim Hills or Corona to have a sit-down
meal."</TE>
<TE>   The city, incorporated in 1991, borders Los Angeles, Orange and
Riverside counties and has direct access to the 57, 60, 71 and 91
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The newness of the planned community is a plus for its 69,000
residents--including many young families and highly educated
professionals--but its freeway-close location is a blessing and a
curse. Shorter commute times into L.A. and Orange counties also mean
a twice-daily onslaught of "drive-through" traffic on city streets
that worsens each year.</TE>
<TE>   And rampant residential development--500 new homes are built in
Chino Hills annually, and the population is expected to top out
around 85,000--without matching commercial growth may bring budget
shortfalls in the next decade unless the city can attract more
commercial tenants to bolster its tax base.</TE>
<TE>   "We've become a pass-through city for people who work in L.A. and
Orange counties but can't afford to live there. They drive through
Chino Hills twice a day going to and from their homes east of us.
It's the No. 1 complaint of our residents, but it's almost impossible
to stop," Mayor Gwenn Norton-Perry said. "We used to be the
affordable community for Orange County workers, years ago, but now
lower-income people can't afford to live here."</TE>
<TE>   Audrey Berniklau, a Realtor with Century 21-King who has lived and
worked in Chino Hills since 1994, said those who choose to live in
the community are two-income professionals with young children.</TE>
<TE>   "Chino Hills is almost a yuppie town," she said. The city's racial
demographics are roughly 56% white (includes 26% Latinos), 22% Asian
and 5% African American--with "other" making up the remainder of the
population. Median household income, according to the city's Web
site, is high--$84,700 annually.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the homes in the main part of Chino Hills sell for
$300,000 to $400,000, but there are a lot of price fluctuations,
depending on how close you are to Orange County," Berniklau said.
"There are new homes in areas that are still selling models, and
there are a large number of gated, custom developments that sell from
$700,000 to $1 million-plus."</TE>
<TE>   On the lower end of the scale, Berniklau said, home shoppers might
find something in Los Serranos--an older area on the east side of the
city, near the 71 freeway. "You could occasionally pick up a
three-bedroom, two-bath there in the $150,000 to $160,000 range, but
it would be 35 years old and most likely a fixer-upper," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the $200,000 price range, there are older three-bedroom,
two-bathroom houses in less than 1,100 square feet that were built in
the early '80s and earlier. Newer homes, built during the 1990s with
three or four bedrooms, two bathrooms in 1,200 to 1,300 square feet,
sell for $300,000 and more. The larger homes of four-plus bedrooms
with 2,500 square feet or more sell in the $400,000 range. Despite
recession and the post-Sept. 11 slump, Berniklau said, homes in Chino
Hills are selling well, though the top end of the market has softened
somewhat.</TE>
<TE>   Families who own their own homes are typical for Chino Hills, with
average household size at 3.15 people and nearly 40% of residents
having a college degree. "These are upwardly mobile, hard-working
professionals," Berniklau said, "who are intending to stay for a
while and make Chino Hills the place they will raise their families."</TE>
<TE>   The description suits Alvarez and Kennedy perfectly. They like the
city's rural feel and its 30 parks; 30 miles of equestrian, hiking
and mountain biking trails; and 3,000 acres of permanently preserved
open space. A portion of Chino Hills State Park falls within city
limits as well.</TE>
<TE>   The couple also enjoy the city's reputation for safety. "You can
walk at night and it's safe," Alvarez said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, for the past five years, Chino Hills has been the safest
city of its size in San Bernardino County, according to Sheriff's
Sgt. Louis Perry. The sheriff's Chino Hills substation houses 42
sworn personnel who are aided in their job by neighborhood watch
groups and an active volunteer citizens patrol. Violent crime is
rare, and traffic fatalities are fairly low, despite the rush-hour
traffic congestion in and around the city. There are no known local
gangs, said Sgt. Tim Peters, who collects crime statistics for the
sheriff's substation.</TE>
<TE>   Chino Hills borders on several communities that have substantially
higher crime rates, but the freeways that surround the city seem to
isolate it, Peters said.</TE>
<TE>   While buyers may get more house for their money in neighboring
Chino or south Ontario, test scores are higher in Chino Hills
schools--a big plus for families. The high-ranking Chino Valley
Unified School District is a major draw for the area, and schools
within the city typically rank among the highest in the district and
the county at large.</TE>
<TE>   The educational prospects attracted Bryan and Janice Metz to Chino
Hills from Rancho Cucamonga last year. The couple, who currently have
no children but plan to start a family, purchased a $235,000
three-bedroom, 21/2-bath- room, 1,796-square-foot condo in the
Morningside development, off Soquel Canyon Road. Janice, who had been
teaching at Chino High School, attained a special-education job at
Chino Hills High when it opened in September.</TE>
<TE>   "She loves her job and thinks very highly of the district," said
Bryan, whose family recently moved its air-conditioning and heating
company into the city from Chino. "The only things that make us
uneasy about the area is that the [Chino state] prison is close by
and there are a lot of dairies that smell bad in the morning and on
windy days."</TE>
<TE>   Scattered remnants of the city's past--like the dairy farms that
linger on the city's border with Chino--may annoy some, but they are
happy reminders of simpler times for Karen Bristow, who has lived in
the community for more than 30 years. Bristow moved into her home, in
an area originally called Glenmeade, in the 1960s, when a local
cattle ranching family, the Greenings, decided to sell off some of
its property to form the area's first subdivisions. Before then,
ranches and dairy farms covered the region.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen it go from a rural community in the middle of nowhere
to the bustling city it is today," Bristow said. Before local
freeways were extended, the long drive over two-lane Carbon Canyon
Road provided the only access to the city, which was an isolated area
home only to a handful of small subdivisions built in the 1920s that
started out as camping retreats. Of those, Los Serranos, Hot Springs
and Sleepy Hollow survive today.</TE>
<TE>   "The area was very rural. We had one gas station, but no grocery
stores," Bristow said. She is now involved in local planning issues
and worries about how the city will attract enough commercial
development to bolster its coffers so it can maintain the services
residents have come to expect.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners will accept only so many municipal fees on their
property, she knows, and measures aimed at limiting growth have
passed in recent years, mandating that high-density development plans
be subject to voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   Bristow is working along with the mayor and others to attract new
commercial development to the city, which has a small tax base and a
lot of expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to ensure that we're not dependent on residential
development, which is eventually going to end, so we need to bring in
new revenue and job-producing sources to our community," said
Norton-Perry, who has lived in Chino Hills since before it was
incorporated and served as the city's first mayor. "It's more
expensive to build commercial projects here because of high developer
fees, our hilly topography, and because we don't have a redevelopment
agency."</TE>
<TE>   The city has approved its first business park and created business
incentive zones along the 71 Freeway in an effort to bring in more
commercial development. Still, it's hard to compete with nearby older
communities that can offer redevelopment agency help and cheaper
land, Norton-Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some successes, however. Big League Dreams, a
softball and baseball recreational facility whose features replicate
major league ballparks, broke ground in Chino Hills, and the city
hopes to attract a similar-sized hockey facility. The city's
attractive demographics have brought in several major retailers,
including Costco, Lowes, Great Indoors, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Steinmart
and Sport Chalet.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if they could only get some nice restaurants, Alvarez said,
Chino Hills would be perfect.</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Speed Up Escrow Account Payoff</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Home sellers and refinancers who pay off their
mortgages frequently wait weeks or months before receiving the funds
remaining in their escrow accounts.</LD>
<LD>   The balances in those accounts can amount to thousands of
dollars--all intended for property taxes, insurance and other annual
expense items. But mortgage servicers are free to retain and profit
from that money long after the underlying loan has been paid off.</LD>
<LD>   Why? Because federal law has a loophole. While Congress has
prescribed detailed rules on how much a mortgage company can require
a borrower to contribute to an escrow account, there are no
provisions in the law about returning escrow account funds. The law
only requires mortgage servicers to provide borrowers with an "escrow
statement" within 60 days of loan payoff.</LD>
<TE>   Say you sell your home and pay off your existing mortgage
balance--principal and interest--with the sale proceeds. Your escrow
account, however, still contains $3,000 or $4,000. But the odds are
that you won't see it for an extended period. If you complain about
it, nobody has the power to compel the mortgage company to return
your money within any deadline.</TE>
<TE>   That will change, however, if forthcoming mortgage reform
legislation passes Congress. Under the bill, escrow account balances
would have to be repaid on the same date as your closing, either in
cash or as an offset against the principal owed to the lender. The
only proviso would be that you must give your servicer at least seven
days' notice of your intent to pay off the loan. If you give less
than seven days' notice, the servicer would still have to send back
your full escrow balance in no less than 21 days.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed the Mortgage Loan Consumer Protection Act, the new bill is
expected to be introduced before Memorial Day, and is likely to
attract strong bipartisan support. Its author has clout: He is the
ranking minority member of the House Financial Services Committee,
Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   Escrow accounts long have been vexing to home buyers, who
frequently complain to federal regulators that they are being asked
to contribute too much. Escrows or impound accounts are required by
most lenders to ensure that recurring large expenses such as local
property taxes, hazard insurance premiums, condominium fees and
others are paid on time.</TE>
<TE>   The rationale is that, left on their own, some borrowers would
forget to pay their taxes on time, thereby potentially creating a
lien on the property that endangers the lender's legal claim to the
house. The same with insurance. If the home is not insured against
fire and other hazards, the lender's collateral securing the mortgage
could be wiped out in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Escrow accounts allow loan servicers to collect toward these
important expense items. Millions of American homeowners pay
principal, interest and an escrow contribution through their monthly
mortgage installments. In high-tax, high-price markets, the escrow
portion of the mortgage payment often totals hundreds of dollars per
month. The mortgage servicer is supposed to administer the account,
paying bills on time over the course of the year.</TE>
<TE>   After mortgage escrow account overcharge scandals in the 1980s and
early 1990s, federal rules were tightened to specify how much money
borrowers can be required to pay into their escrow accounts. Under
those rules, a lender can collect 1/12 of the anticipated cost of
each escrow item per month--1/12 of annual property taxes, 1/12 of
insurance premiums, etc. The lender can also collect up to two
months' worth of "cushion" for the account, just in case one or more
of the escrow items costs more than projected.</TE>
<TE>   There is no federal requirement for interest to be paid to
consumers on their escrow balances, and for most loan servicers
escrow accounts are a source of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the return-of-escrow deadline, LaFalce's bill would also
make mortgage servicers liable for any fees or penalties that arise
when they fail to make timely payments of property taxes or insurance
premiums on the borrower's behalf. Under current federal rules they
are free to tack penalties onto borrowers' accounts--in effect
charging consumers for the servicer's own lateness or mishandling.</TE>
<TE>   LaFalce's draft mortgage reform bill goes far beyond escrow
accounts. It seeks to correct a long list of problems in federal law
related to home mortgage settlements, from junk fees and markups to
last-minute deliveries of settlement statements. Under the bill, all
consumers would have to be given their settlement documents no later
than two days before the closing, allowing plenty of time to review
and question fees.</TE>

<LD>In 1922, Paul F. Johnson, a mechanical engineer who installed the
pneumatically operated tower clock in the Philadelphia City Hall, set
up KGO as one of the first radio stations on the West Coast,
operating in Altadena from his 12-room, Chinese/ Mediterranean-style
home on 14 acres. Three years later, he had this home built on his
property for his son, Seymour. Johnson also had a house built on his
estate in 1930 for his daughter, Eleanor.</LD>
<LD>   About this house: Described as Spanish Colonial Revival, the house
was completed in 1925 but was extensively remodeled by architect
Theodore Pletsch in 1932. Seymour Johnson, a radio technician and
engineer, lived there with his wife, Marian. He took title to 6.5
acres, including his home, in 1934. The property was later
subdivided.</LD>
<LD>   Asking price: $949,000</LD>
<TE>   Size: Five bedrooms and four bathrooms in 5,090 square feet on a
12,000-square-foot lot.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The formal dining room overlooks gardens and mountains.
The living room has arched windows, a fireplace and French doors. The
master suite has a sleeping porch. The kitchen has a breakfast nook
with French doors leading to a patio and gardens. The chimney and

<LD>Martin Sheen, who plays U.S. President Josiah Bartlet in the NBC
series "The West Wing," and his wife, Janet, have listed a Santa
Monica cottage they have used as a pied-a-terre. The asking price is
just under $2.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The house, which Janet Sheen renovated and redecorated, has two
bedrooms, a den, a loft and 2.5 bathrooms in more than 1,400 square
feet.</LD>
<LD>   Built in 1950, the house has been owned by the Sheens for six
years. It was described as a "hippie-type cottage" when they bought
it.</LD>
<TE>   The hillside hideaway, which has ocean and mountain views, has
been used by the Sheens as a stopping-off place en route to their
longtime home in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   The cottage was midway if they wanted to go to an event in town,
but now that Martin Sheen is doing the series, he is generally too
busy to stay in Santa Monica, and his wife's done with the
refurbishing and ready for a new project.</TE>
<TE>   The Emmy-winning actor, 61, has earned praise for numerous
performances, including those in the series "Murphy Brown" (1993) and
the movie "Apocalypse Now" (1979). He also has won accolades for
stage work in London and New York, where he appeared on Broadway in
such plays as "Death of a Salesman."</TE>
<TE>   The Sheens are parents of actors Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez,
Ramon Estevez and Renee Estevez, who has played a staffer on "The
West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Jo Wilder of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North, has the
listing.</TE>

<TE>   Jimmie Rodgers, the three-time Grammy nominee who has sold more
than 80 million records, including such hits as "Honeycomb" and
"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine," has listed his home 10 miles from
Branson, Mo., at $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   The singer-composer, who has been performing in Branson since
1992, when he opened his "Honeycomb Family Theatre" there, is selling
his Missouri home on Lake Taneycomo as he is planning to move his
show to the Palm Desert area next season or later this year so he can
sing at night and play golf during the day. Performances of his
one-man retrospective, "Jimmie Rodgers, His Life &amp; Music" have been
sold out nightly in Branson since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the early '70s, his house, which he bought in 1995, has
four bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms in 3,000 square feet. It is on 2.5
acres of wooded Ozark Mountain property.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by a private road, the home has a master suite with a
fireplace and a spa; a 1,000-square-foot detached workshop; a six-car
garage; two private boat docks and 180-degree lake views.</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers, 68, recently finished his 62nd album and has three
animated film projects with original music ready for production. He
performed songs for such movies as "Men of Honor" (2000) and "My
Cousin Vinny" (1992), and he appeared with Jack Nicholson in the
movie "Back Door to Hell" (1964).</TE>
<TE>   A film is in the works about Rodgers' career and recovery from a
violent encounter in 1967 with an off-duty policeman in the San
Fernando Valley. Rodgers' head wounds from the incident halted his
soaring career. It took him 15 years to recover. He underwent three
brain surgeries and has a metal plate in his head, but during rehab,
he learned to fly, took up skydiving and started running up to 13
miles a day.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Rodgers, the singer's son, sang with his father in Branson
and was an opening act for Clint Black before earning a real estate
license in January 2000 to spend more time with his family in the
L.A. area.</TE>
<TE>   He has the Missouri listing at Pinnacle Estate Properties in
Northridge.</TE>

<TE>   Portia de Rossi, who plays attorney Nelle Porter on the Fox series
"Ally McBeal," has listed her Hollywood penthouse at just under $1.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   The actress put her condo on the market because she bought a
nearby home in the mid-$2-million range.</TE>
<TE>   The penthouse, which she has owned since February 2000, has two
bedrooms and two bathrooms in 2,600 square feet. The three-story
condo also has downtown L.A. and Hollywood Hills views, 30-foot-high
vaulted ceilings, hardwood floors and an updated kitchen with
stainless-steel appliances.</TE>
<TE>   The French Normandy-style building, constructed in 1930, has a
doorman on duty around the clock. Former residents include Marilyn
Monroe and Rock Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   De Rossi, 29, purchased a Spanish-style home in Los Feliz, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   She moved to the U.S. from her native Melbourne, Australia, in
1995, after making her film debut in the Australian movie "Sirens."
In 1998, she joined the cast of "Ally McBeal," which will mark its
series finale Monday.</TE>
<TE>   De Rossi plays Richard Dreyfuss' daughter in the recently
completed comedy film "Who Is Cletis Tout?" and has the lead in the
upcoming movie "The Night We Called It a Day."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Moore of Re/Max, Sunset Boulevard, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiiu Leek, former weeknight co-anchor at KTLA Channel 5 and an
actress who has played a reporter in such series as "The Practice"
and "NYPD Blue," and her attorney husband, William Jacobson, have
sold their Westwood home for slightly more than $1 million and moved
to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1958, the ranch-style house has four bedrooms and 3.5
bathrooms in 3,000 square feet. The home also has a breakfast area,
two fireplaces, a lagoon-like pool and a spa.</TE>
<TE>   Bernice and Janine Gershon of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills
South, were the selling agents, and William Gubin of Coldwell Banker,
Brentwood Court, had the listing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oscar-winning sound supervisor Gloria Borders has purchased a home
in Los Feliz for close to its asking price of $1.3 million, and she
has sold her former home in the same area for about $689,500.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1937, the house she bought is Mediterranean in style and
has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a media room and a 40-foot-long
pool.</TE>
<TE>   The house she sold, built in 1940, is Cape Cod in style and has
two bedrooms and one bathroom in the main house plus a one-bedroom
guest house. The home also has hillside and mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   Borders, who had a long career at George Lucas' Skywalker Sound
before moving in 2000 to Universal Studios, earned an Academy Award
for her sound-editing work on "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991).
She also worked on such movies as "Star Wars: Episode VI--Return of
the Jedi" (1983), "The Godfather, Part III" (1990) and "Mrs.
Doubtfire" (1993). Borders won an Oscar nomination in 1995 for her
work on "Forrest Gump."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Holley and Jana Jones-Duffy of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills
South, represented Borders in buying and selling.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Beverly Hills home built in 1927 for actress Loretta Young's
mother has been sold for about $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The gated Spanish-style estate was also a home during the late
1930s filming of "Gone With the Wind" for its leading lady, Vivien
Leigh, and actor Lawrence Olivier.</TE>
<TE>   Later, actress Jean Peters lived there when she was dating Howard
Hughes. Peters, who met the billionaire in 1946, was married to
Hughes for 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   The home, sold by husband-wife entertainment attorneys Donald and
Judith Engel, has three bedrooms and maid's quarters in about 7,700
square feet. The home also has an office, recreation room, four
fireplaces, nine bathrooms, a pool and a spa. The half-acre property
has lush gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Listing agent Sid Kibrick of Nourmand &amp; Associates in Beverly
Hills had eight offers on the house and sold it within eight days of
its coming on the market, he said.</TE>

<DH>From ceiling to counter top, a couple's kitchen remodel
runs into unexpected delays and expenses.</DH>
<SE>Second of three parts</SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the sun set on the second day of Val and Bernie Van De Yacht's
kitchen remodel, Bernie was philosophical about a day marked with
delays, frustrations and bad news. "Well," he said, "every day can't
be perfect."</LD>
<LD>   The previous day the cabinetmaker had arrived 15 minutes earlier
than scheduled, then ripped out and hauled off most of the kitchen's
old cabinets and counters. But when part of the ceiling peeled away
with the cabinets, Val and Bernie faced their first unexpected and
non-budgeted problem--redoing the ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   After three years of dreaming and months of planning, Val and
Bernie, both 38, were creating a '50s farmhouse kitchen in their 1927
North Hollywood Tudor home. With a budget of $13,900 and a time frame
of two weeks, they planned on new cabinets, some with stamped metal
sheeting in the doors, a nostalgic farm-style sink, granite-like
Silestone counters, distressed brick behind the stove, a retro-style
Northstar refrigerator and a rustic pine floor.</LD>
<TE>   Day 2 called for electrician James Witczak to install the wiring
for new outlets--always needed in older homes--and for the plumber to
add rough fittings and pipes for the sink, garbage disposal and
dishwasher.</TE>
<TE>   Before the job started, the couple enjoyed the jokes of the
easy-going electrician, who is also a magician and member of the
Magic Castle in Hollywood. The jokes faded, however, as Witczak
struggled to cut new outlets into the sturdy wall construction.</TE>
<TE>   "Lath and plaster is a [phrase] I won't soon forget," Bernie said,
"since I heard it cursed about 50 times today."</TE>
<TE>   Work had started later than planned on Day 2, and that concerned
Bernie, who wanted to keep the job on track. Knowing that
subcontractors juggle several jobs at a time, Bernie perfected a
phone-calling strategy to get them there on time: First, he called
with a "soft warning," then a "firm warning" and finally a "solid
warning."</TE>
<TE>   "Organization is the key," Bernie had said initially. As he
learned that a vintage home remodel can take unforeseen turns,
however, he changed his time frame from two weeks to one month. The
budget would also increase, to $15,730.</TE>
<TE>   Day 2 brought news that a close relative had been diagnosed with
cancer. With the remodel in full swing, Val was crying one minute and
ordering antique accessories off EBay the next. But they pressed on.</TE>
<TE>   A bright spot in Bernie's day was polishing a round aluminum cover
for a chute, part of the original house, that channels trash from an
opening in the countertop to a box on the outside of the house. "Oh,
the small pleasures," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Day 3 found Val and Bernie at the hospital with their relative
while the electrician finished up at the house. With the kitchen out
of commission, the couple ordered takeout for dinner. This delighted
Val, who shuffled through a stack of menus for Indian, Thai and
Italian cuisine. "It's like a vacation."</TE>
<TE>   For breakfasts and lunches, they kept a supply of energy bars and
other nonperishables in the dining room, along with paper plates and
plastic forks, and kept drinks and dairy products in a garage
refrigerator. They offered their tradesmen cold drinks each time they
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, the remodel took on a rhythm. The carpenter would
install some cabinets on Day 4, a Friday, and a plasterer would patch
holes on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the cabinetmaker would be back to do more work. The
sense of progress sat well with Bernie. "Bada bing, bada boom," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   After the cabinets were in, the couple decided they didn't like
the brass hinges that cabinetmaker Chris Trauger had chosen, so
Trauger changed them for nickel hinges Val ordered from the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, Val and Bernie tore the old paint-covered wallpaper
off the damaged ceiling and weighed their choices for repairs: having
it plastered or covered with tongue-and-groove wood. As part of their
nightly routine, they also thoroughly cleaned the kitchen in
preparation for the next day's workers.</TE>
<TE>   By Day 4, Bernie and Val eased up their intense supervision of the
job, mainly because they were so busy--Val with the gym she co-owns,
Curves for Women in Newhall, Bernie with his acting and writing
career, and both with visits to the hospital. "You have to trust that
you can leave your workers alone and hope they know what they're
doing," Bernie said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the places disturbed by the electrical and plumbing
work were patched by plasterer Terry Carver, whom the couple had met
during daily jaunts to Starbucks. When Carver said the bill was only
$80, Bernie upped that to $100.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was a down day, and, as it turns out, so was Monday. On
many weekends during the remodel, the couple visited their favorite
shopping grounds for '50s collectibles, a swap meet in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Trauger installed the rest of the cabinets on Tuesday, Day 8 of
the remodel. He also quoted the Van De Yachts a price of $610 for the
tongue-and-groove ceiling and though it wasn't in the original
budget, the couple said yes.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Smith, a stone and tile installer, came by with the white
tile for the backsplash. When Bernie discovered the tile was the
wrong size, Smith cleared it up with a phone call.</TE>
<TE>   The big event for Tuesday was delivery of the counter tops, which
are made of Silestone, an engineered product of ground granite. Val
and Bernie chose gray with shiny bits of quartz throughout.</TE>
<TE>   "Slight problem," Bernie said, when the counter arrived. It had an
inch-long gouge in it. While Bernie "didn't want to come off as
snooty oh-there's-a-little-scratch-take-it-away type of people," he
said he figured that for the price he paid, $1,350, "it just wasn't
acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   The counter fabricator agreed to return the next day with an
unblemished piece. When the counter came back on Day 9, it didn't
matter to Bernie whether the gouged section was repaired or replaced.
"It looks great," he said. "Who knows what they did to it? Who
cares?"</TE>
<TE>   No one seemed to know how it occurred, but about this time a hinge
broke off the newly polished aluminum cover for the trash chute. This
bothered Bernie, who figured it was damaged when the counter was
being installed.</TE>
<TE>   "Things get broken in life, right?" Bernie said, who tried to find
out what happened. "But when someone won't admit it...."</TE>
<TE>   Bernie called Trauger, who had hired the counter installer. "Don't
worry about it," Trauger said. "I'll take care of it."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Bernie laughed when Trauger said he saw the "angry side of
Bernie."</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently they think we're really nice," Bernie said. "We're not
that nice. We're really picky."</TE>
<TE>   Floor refinisher Raymond Sjolseth characterized the couple as
"meticulous" and easy to work for because "they know exactly what
they want, which is rare."In a domino effect, the delay caused by the
counter set the tile setter back, and he agreed to start his work on
Thursday, Day 10.</TE>
<TE>   Over the following three days, he and a helper installed the brick
on the walls behind the stove--where the couple wanted an old, rustic
look--and the white tile on the backsplash. Val and Bernie fretted
about the grout. Was it too dark? Smith assured them it would lighten
as it dried.</TE>
<TE>   On Day 14, the couple's plumber returned to install the sink,
Chicago faucets, garbage disposal and super-quiet Asko dishwasher.
Johnny Van Diepen, owner of Pipe Dreams Plumbing Co., not only solved
a problem when the sink and faucets didn't quite match up, but later
fixed a faulty stove knob that caused the burner to sputter out when
turned low. "Now I can simmer," Val said.</TE>
<TE>   With everything falling into place, roughly midway between the
destruction of the old, bland room and the completion of the cozy
farmhouse kitchen, Bernie's self-confidence faltered.</TE>
<TE>   "The doubt is starting to creep in," he said. "It's really hard to
visualize the end product when it's in this stage."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest unknown was whether the paint--a creamy white for the
cabinets and ceiling, and pale pink for the walls--would tie it all
together.</TE>
<TE>   "You do your best to pick out the right elements and then just
hope that when they're installed they work well together," Bernie
said. "I'm probably just worrying over nothing. Right?"</TE>

<HD>The Best Fixer-Uppers Will Need Only Minor Repairs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You want to buy a house because you know the current low mortgage
interest rates are a real deal. So you've been inspecting dozens of
houses at weekend open houses. But every time you make a purchase
offer, another buyer offers slightly more and buys the house.</LD>
<LD>   You want to buy a nice house, in decent condition, in a good
neighborhood with great schools. However, that doesn't seem to be
working out. Maybe it's time to change your focus. Have you
considered fixer-upper houses?</LD>
<LD>   Real estate agents have various names for houses that need repair
work. Savvy agents advertise them as "handyperson specials." Others
use the words "original condition."</LD>
<TE>   The only valid reason to buy such a house is to acquire a
bargain-priced home or investment. This is not the type of residence
most buyers want, so you will have less competition from other
buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you call these houses, they can be incredible bargains if
you don't mind doing a little work before or after moving in.</TE>
<TE>   Some fixers are listed for sale with reputable real estate agents.
Others are not openly on the market for sale, and it takes a sharp
detective of a realty agent to find their owners because these houses
are usually vacant.</TE>
<TE>   The most profitable fixers just need inside and outside painting
(the most profitable improvement of all) and other minor improvements
such as new kitchen cabinets, fresh landscaping, new wall-to-wall
carpets, new light fixtures and a complete cleanup. This is called a
cosmetic fix-up.</TE>
<TE>   Fixers to avoid are those that need major, unprofitable
rehabilitation. Examples include a new roof, foundation repairs and
structural work. Avoid fixers that don't fit in their neighborhoods,
such as a two-bedroom, one-bathroom house in a neighborhood of three-
and four-bedroom homes.</TE>
<TE>   The best fixer-upper opportunities are residences that can be
bought at least 20% to 30% below what the house will be worth after
fixing it. Don't even consider houses that cry out for room additions
or major remodeling; the improvement cost will usually exceed the
value added (unless you buy at an incredible bargain price). Look for
houses that are sound and well-located but look "tired" because they
haven't been updated for at least 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   For buyer protection, it is smart to include a purchase offer
professional inspection contingency clause. That means, after your
offer is accepted by the seller, you have the right to hire a
professional inspector who will prepare a report on the fixer-upper
house. Be sure to accompany the inspector to discuss any undisclosed
defects that are discovered. Oral reports are often more revealing
than written reports.</TE>
<TE>   For example, I purchased a fixer at an incredible bargain price
that had an obvious bad crack in the fireplace. I accompanied my
professional inspector. He carefully checked the chimney, climbed up
in the attic and reported the crack could easily be repaired at a
cost of about $150. The happy result was I bought a house that had
been rejected by many buyers who saw that fireplace crack and refused
to even make a purchase offer.</TE>
<TE>   If the report reveals serious defects, ask the seller to give you
a credit for the repair cost. Should the seller refuse to negotiate,
use your home inspection contingency clause to cancel the purchase
and get your earnest-money deposit refunded.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 Tax Act opened up a brand-new tax-free
multimillion-dollar industry for buyers of fixer-upper homes.</TE>
<TE>   If you buy and occupy your principal residence at least two of the
five years before its sale (whether or not it's a fixer-upper home),
up to $250,000 per qualified home seller (up to $500,000 for a
married couple filing jointly) net profits will be completely
tax-free. Congress even made this tax break reusable every 24 months,
without limit.</TE>
<TE>   Should you enjoy buying rundown fixer houses and reselling them,
you can repeat this tax-free process over and over. Just move in,
live in the home at least two of the five years before its sale and
claim your tax-free profits upon sale. When you do this repeatedly,
you will become known among your friends as a "serial home seller."</TE>

<HD>Whole-House Generators Can Keep Electricity Flowing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES DULLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: There are occasional electrical power outages in my area,
so I thought about getting an automatic whole-house emergency
generator. Are they expensive to operate and can they really power an
entire house?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Whole-house standby generators are becoming much more
popular because of the many electrical devices used in homes today.
It can often be difficult for a family to get by without electricity
for even a short time.</LD>
<LD>   If you are away from home and your lights and security system
don't function because of a power outage, your house is easy prey for
thieves or vandals.</LD>
<TE>   Although you can install a manual transfer switch to switch over
to the standby generator, most whole-house standby generators use an
automatic transfer switch. When the electricity goes off, it
automatically disconnects your house from the power grid and starts
the generator.</TE>
<TE>   Most models restore full electric power to your house in about 10
seconds. About all you will have to do is reset your digital clocks.
The automatic transfer switch also "exercises" the motor and
generator every week or two to make sure it is in good working
condition when needed.</TE>
<TE>   For most homes, a 10-kilowatt to 15-kilowatt output standby
generator will provide adequate power. Most models in this
residential-size range are powered by natural gas or propane and are
relatively efficient and inexpensive to operate. Models with diesel
engines are also available.</TE>
<TE>   Models that run on natural gas or propane have a small one- or
two-cylinder engine inside. Running on these very clean-burning fuels
requires very little maintenance other than a spark plug or oil
change every 100 or so hours of operation. The propane models are
slightly more powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Most standby generators are about the size of a typical central
air-conditioner outdoor unit and are located near a house wall. The
small gas or propane engines operate very quietly. The automatic
transfer switch is usually located on the wall near your circuit
breaker panel indoors.</TE>
<TE>   A less expensive emergency generator option is a portable
gasoline-powered model. Some of them have outputs as high as 6
kilowatts, so they can easily power most of your family's essential
needs. These normally use a manual transfer switch, so you must start
the engine and throw the switch yourself.</TE>
<TE>   With small portable generators, appliances are often plugged into
the generator with extension cords. If any generator is attached to
the house wiring, a transfer switch is needed to protect the utility
company's workers.</TE>

Bulletin No. 605, a buyer's guide to eight automatic whole-house and
portable emergency generator manufacturers.</TE>

<TE>   The Best Ways to Solve Cold-Shower Syndrome</TE>
<TE>   Q: We run out of water for morning showers. Our incoming water is
very cold, so I thought of installing a tankless water heater to
preheat the incoming water to the main water heater. Does this sound
good?</TE>
<TE>   A: What you are suggesting would probably work, but it is not the
best or most energy-efficient way to go. If your existing water
heater is old, you might just consider replacing it with a new,
higher-output model.</TE>
<TE>   If family members can take showers consecutively instead of
concurrently in several bathrooms, using a tank-less water heater to
supply hot water directly for the bathrooms would be your best and
most efficient option.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How to Match Tracks to Triple-Panel Doors</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have a triple-track storm/screen door over my back door. I
pulled out the glass and screen panels to clean them. How can I tell
what is the proper way to position them back in the tracks?</TE>
<TE>   A: Not all triple-track storm doors are the same, but in general,
you can match up the panels with the width of the tracks. The track
on the outdoor side is usually the smallest and the indoor one is the
widest. The latches usually go to the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Also check the positioning of the weatherstripping between the
panels. When installed properly in the door frame, the
weatherstripping should seal all gaps between the panels.</TE>

money-saving improvements and products that he tests. There are

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Buyer Regrets Agreeing to Binding Arbitration" by Robert
J. Bruss, May 5: I personally was involved in an arbitration case,
which turned out very favorable, and I found the arbitrator to be
logical and fair to both parties.</LD>
<LD>   The major risk in a jury trial is the irrational and unpredictable
decisions of people. Evidence can be presented with high odds of
winning, only to result in a jury making an opposite decision.</LD>
<LD>   Winning at Las Vegas has better odds than winning at a jury trial.
An arbitrator at least has the background, experience and education
in the legal process.</LD>
<TE>   Arbitration is the most efficient legal process, especially when
considering the cost of attorneys, time and legal proceedings. Having
the right to appeal only compounds the problem. Attorneys are the
only winners in litigation.</TE>

<HD>HUD Making Consumers a Priority</HD>

<AU>LEW SICHELMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--When the borrower questioned a closing fee that wasn't on
the good-faith estimate he received when he applied for financing, it
was quickly removed. But when he received a copy of the amended
settlement sheet in the mail a few days after closing, the charge had
been reinstated.</LD>
<LD>   And when another borrower took exception to a $500 charge that was
levied because he refused to use the title insurance company that was
affiliated with the real estate broker, it, too, was eliminated. At
the same time, though, a new $500 charge was added, this one a
processing fee.</LD>
<LD>   These are two of Ivy Jackson's "favorite" complaints to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Jackson is the
government's top cop when it comes to the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, or RESPA, the consumer protection statute that, among
other things, is intended to help consumers shop for settlement
services and eliminate kickbacks and referral fees that unnecessarily
increase closing costs.</LD>
<TE>   Under previous HUD regimes, these complaints and thousands of
others like them wouldn't have received much attention from Jackson's
understaffed, two-person RESPA enforcement division. But things are
different under current Secretary Mel Martinez, who has vowed to
enforce the law with renewed energy.</TE>
<TE>   Since November, the department has taken action against nearly 50
companies for various RESPA violations, and collected some $2.5
million in fines. Monetary settlements aren't the worst part, though.
These firms also have suffered from the negative publicity that goes
along with such charges.</TE>
<TE>   And it won't stop there. HUD recently signed a $1.5-million
contract for investigative services with a Virginia firm that is
staffed for the most part by former agents from the Secret Service,
FBI, U.S. Customs Office and the criminal division of the Internal
Revenue Service.</TE>
<TE>   "RESPA is a secretarial priority," said Jackson, whose office also
has received a significant infusion of manpower in the past few
months. "Secretary Martinez is serious about RESPA enforcement, and
we will be vigorously investigating illegal practices that come to
our attention."</TE>
<TE>   It's a good thing, because the complaints just keep rolling in.
Known in mortgage circles as "the RESPA Ranger," Jackson recently
took a look at the last 2,500 grievances received by her office. One
in four was not applicable, meaning it either wasn't valid or it
wasn't covered under this law. But the rest were. Here's how they
broke down under different sections of RESPA:</TE>
<TE>   * Sections 4 and 5 of RESPA prohibit lenders from increasing
charges at closing that were said to cost less on the good-faith
estimate of settlement fees the borrower was supposed to receive
within three days of applying for the mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints about lenders who violate this part of the law "seem to
be increasing," according to Jackson, who says they account for 8% of
the gripes her office receives. So be sure to compare the two
documents. Borrowers can't expect the estimate to be exact. The
lender may be off on the exact amount that must be collected for an
escrow account for taxes and insurance, which depends on the closing
day.</TE>
<TE>   The lender also can't underestimate other known charges. In other
words, if the lender tells you up front that the credit report will
cost $15 and the appraisal will run $200, that's what should be
reflected on the HUD-1 closing statement. The processing fee or the
fee paid to the mortgage broker can't be higher, either.</TE>
<TE>   * Section 6: Under this part of the law, lenders are required to
make escrow disbursements on time. Apparently many don't; about 26%
of the complaints fall under this section. In one case, the lender
failed to pay the borrower's insurance premium. And when the policy
lapsed, the lender tried to require the owner to pay a higher rate
through its own carrier.</TE>
<TE>   As long as you are not more than a month behind on your house
payments, insurance premiums, property taxes and other charges must
be paid by the lender on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty.
Lenders don't have to take advantage of discounts for paying early,
but they can't be late. Be sure to review your annual escrow
statement to be certain the lender paid on time and did not charge
late fees to your account.</TE>
<TE>   * Section 8: Most complaints (34%) involve this part of the law,
which prohibits anyone from giving or accepting a fee, kickback or
anything of value in exchange for referring business his or her way.
It also prohibits someone from giving or taking any part of a charge
for services that weren't performed.</TE>
<TE>   There are many schemes to try to skirt Section 8. They range from
free dinners to under-the-table cash bonuses. Most are too elaborate
to be detected by unwary borrowers. But they aren't missed by other
lenders or settlement service providers, who will squeal on rivals
lest they gain an unfair competitive advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The rule of thumb, said Washington attorney Philip Schulman, is
that if the benefit goes to the consumer, it is not a violation of
the law. It's perfectly fine for a builder to offer a buyer a free
appliance package in exchange for going through an affiliated
mortgage company. But it's not OK for a real estate agent to accept a
trip to Vegas for sending a dozen clients to a certain closing agent.</TE>
<TE>   * Section 9 prevents a seller from requiring a buyer to use a
particular title insurance company as a condition of the sale. Though
only 2% of the complaints involve Section 9, they, too, are on the
increase, Jackson reported.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, violations involve a builder who charges an additional
fee if the buyer opts against using an affiliated title company. Last
fall, HUD required a major Florida firm to reimburse 168 buyers who
were hit not only with an extra fee for using an independent title
firm but also were forced to pay 1.5% of the price of their homes as
closing costs without regard to whether the company's actual costs
equaled that amount.</TE>
<TE>   * Section 10: About 5% of complaints involve escrow amounts
collected by the lender for taxes, insurance and other charges
related to the property. Despite what some lenders may tell you,
RESPA does not require lenders to impose escrow accounts on
borrowers. "It's a lender requirement, not a legal one," Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   But certain government loan programs and lenders insist on them as
a loan condition. If that's the case, the law says they cannot
collect excessive amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Each month, the lender may require you to pay no more than
one-twelfth of the total of all disbursements payable during the year
plus an amount necessary to pay for any shortage in the account. In
addition, the lender can require a cushion not to exceed an amount
equal to one-sixth of the total disbursements for the year.</TE>
<TE>   But just because your escrow payment jumps up when your loan is
transferred from one lender to another doesn't mean there's a
violation. Typically, the new owner requires a full one-sixth
cushion, whereas the old one required only one-twelfth or perhaps
none at all. If the mortgage documents or law in a state set a more
limited cushion--for example, one month's escrow payments instead of
two--RESPA defers to the loan papers or state law.</TE>

<HD>All-Electronic Loans Are Still Far Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW SICHELMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forward thinkers in the mortgage business dream of the day when
borrowers will close on their loans electronically from home.</LD>
<LD>   They'd still have the same number of papers to read and sign.
After all, most of those are required by law, not by the lender. But
at least they'd have electronic versions well in advance to peruse at
their leisure so there will be no surprises. And they'd be able to
click their approval onto each page instead of having to sign every
last one.</LD>
<LD>   Lenders also will benefit. No longer will they send loan papers to
closing agents, not knowing what they'll get back or whether the file
will be intact. At least one major lender operates a lost note
department to retrieve missing documents.</LD>
<TE>   But don't hold your breath. Despite some well-publicized "firsts,"
these supposed all-electronic transactions were not milestones. In
most cases, the reams of documents were printed out on paper later so
the information could be verified and stored.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some experts say it will be at least three years before
electronic mortgages become commonplace. And it's been two years
since the signing of the Electronic Signatures Act that was supposed
to make all this happen.</TE>
<TE>   What's the hang-up? For one thing, the mortgage business is only
now coming to terms with a common framework of key data standards for
paperless home loans.</TE>
<TE>   Until these are in place, the corps of professionals who have a
hand in the transaction--the lenders, appraisers, title companies,
surveyors, flood certification specialists, just to name a few--will
not be able to exchange paperless documents at will.</TE>
<TE>   Nor will anyone trust the quality or the integrity of the
information contained therein.</TE>
<TE>   For another, only a handful of the nation's 3,000-plus county
recorders are equipped to receive, register and post electronic
documents. About 80% of all closings take place in perhaps 200
counties, so there's not that far to go.</TE>
<TE>   But if you're not in Fairfax County, Va., Broward County, Fla.,
Maricopa County, Ariz., or one of perhaps two dozen other
jurisdictions nationwide, everything that's generated by a computer
has to be printed out before it can be recorded.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, most states still require that mortgage documents be
notarized as proof that the borrower did not do so under duress. So
even if you want to sign electronically, a notary will have to be
there, too.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the borrowers. Just as lenders have embraced the
Internet as a business channel to efficiently and inexpensively
originate mortgages, computer-savvy consumers have accepted it as a
way to quickly search for information, compare rates and, yes,
sometimes even apply for financing.</TE>
<TE>   But are consumers ready to take the next step, a leap of faith
that what we saw and signed on the monitor screen and what comes out
a dozen years later when we pay off our loans or question what we
still owe will be one and the same?</TE>
<TE>   Mark Oliphant, who is responsible for e-mortgage solutions at
Fannie Mae, the nation's largest supplier of money for home loans,
thinks we are.</TE>
<TE>   Oliphant says that based on his company's experience with several
test programs, he doesn't think there will be a problem. "Whether
electronic mortgages will become mainstream remains to be seen," he
said, "but I'm encouraged."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bellenger of Vested Technologies in Rocky Hill, Conn., used
to be enthusiastic, too. Now he's not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   After President Clinton signed the E-Signatures Act in June 2000,
setting out the legal framework for conducting business
electronically, Bellenger predicted that his firm, a division of the
Connecticut Attorney Title Insurance Co., the largest domestic title
underwriter in New England, would do its first true electronic
closing before the year ended.</TE>
<TE>   Not only has that seminal event never taken place, Bellenger said
it's "not even close to happening."</TE>
<TE>   Buyers and sellers are "leery" of not having paper, said
Bellenger, who has come to learn that just because a law is passed
doesn't mean something will happen automatically. "Few people are
asking for this."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't square with the results of a recent survey by Myers
Internet Services of San Jose, which found that three out of four
borrowers are willing to complete the entire mortgage process online,
once digital signatures become available.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the Myers study is on target, there's still a big
problem: Only 1% of all loan originators have implemented an
e-signature platform, according to Mortech, a Silver Spring, Md.,
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, while most lenders think paperless mortgages are
a good idea, for the most part they are waiting for it to happen
before they invest in the technology. "Every lender we talk to says
they aren't doing a thing [until they receive] clear guidance,"
Bellenger said.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, consumers who are eager to move forward will have to
be content with shopping and applying for a mortgage online. The rest
is still being done the old-fashioned way, with pen and paper.</TE>

<HD>How to Report Settlement Violations to RESPA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lew Sichelman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act are subject
to various penalties, depending on what part of the law has been
violated. People who violate Section 8 may be fined up to $10,000 and
jailed for up to one year. Also, they may be liable for other
damages.</LD>
<LD>   To report violations, write to: Director, Interstate Land
Sales/RESPA Division, Office of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 9146, 451 7th St.
S.W., Washington, DC 20410.</LD>
<LD>   Be sure to identify the violator by name, address and phone number
and provide your own name and number for follow-up. Requests for
confidentiality will be honored.</LD>
<TE>   If your complaint involves loan servicing, including escrow
account questions, you must first ask your lender in writing for an
explanation and refund. Make sure you label the letter as "a
qualified written request under Section 6 of RESPA." A sample letter
can be found on HUD's Web site at
www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/res/respa_hm.cfm.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, the lender must respond within 20 days and resolve
the issue within 60. If the company fails to meet those deadlines,
write to HUD.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rental problems abound: evictions, unreturned deposits, high rent
increases. So where do consumers go to find out about the law and
their rights?</LD>
<LD>   A great place to start is with the California Department of
Consumer Affairs. Its Web site, www.dca.ca.gov, is a toolbox for
building knowledge.</LD>
<LD>   For an overview, click on "Consumer Information Center." The site
explains its mission, purpose and how to file a complaint. Scroll
down to the picture of the open book and click on "links to other
consumer and government sites" to find other sites.</LD>
<TE>   The index provides a link to virtually every government and
consumer site available on the Web. For direct access, go to www.dca.
ca.gov/cic/cicindex.htm. Seventeen sites are listed and explained in
easy-to-read detail. At your fingertips are choices including
international and federal sites, California government sites,
Consumer World and a terrific Resource and Referral Guide.</TE>
<TE>   Clicking the green button for each site brings myriad choices. For
example, the Department of Consumer Affairs Sites will provide
detailed links for all 36 department entities that license more than
200 professions and occupations. Included on this four-page site are
links to California state government sites, ranging from the
Department of Aging to the Department of Veteran Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 U.S. government sites are also linked, which can take
you from the Aviation Administration to the Internal Revenue Service
with a click of the mouse.</TE>
<TE>   The final section on this site links agencies outside their
network. The links can take you from the Better Business Bureau to
Scamwatch. For tenants, there's a handy link at the bottom of the
page at the Tenants Union site.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants Union will send you to the "Tenant Resource Directory,"
which provides links to sites for renters anywhere in the United
States. Click on California and be transported to "California
Resources for Renters." This site provides information on 21
different local resources for landlords and tenants. Everything from
the Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board to Santa Monicans for Renters'
Rights is included. Address, e-mail and phone numbers to reach the
individual agencies are provided. Back at the index, the "Resource
and Referral Guide" gives an excellent breakdown of where to resolve
problems. This guide features 23 sites to select from.</TE>
<TE>   Scrolling down this multi-linked site will reveal a step-by-step
section on how to resolve complaints. This five-page site walks you
through everything from where to file complaints to local agencies to
legal agencies. For example, clicking on "Small Claims Court" will
transport you to a complete site, listing every court in California
and how to reach them.</TE>
<TE>   From the index, my favorite site is the "Landlord/Tenant Rights
and Responsibilities." Published by the Department of Consumer
Affairs, this guide is the most complete source of definitions, laws
and information. With 24 sections, this guide, starting at "Notice
... the Fine Print," walks you through everything from unlawful
discrimination to moving out.</TE>
<TE>   Sites are subject to change without notice, so you may need to use
the search box to recapture lost sites.</TE>
<TE>   No computer access? Order California Department of Consumer Affair
publications at (800) 952-5210. From out of state, call (916)
445-1254.</TE>

<LD>   There is nothing more energy-efficient or easier on the eyes than
fluorescent lighting. Using a stepladder, remove and wash the lenses
and change all the bulbs.</LD>
<LD>   If flickering continues, replace the ballast unit. The units cost

<HD>A Not-So-Carnal Carnival</HD>
<DH>Festa Juninas is celebrated with the spirit, but not the
skin, of its Rio cousin</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CARUARU, Brazil</DL>
<LD>A little more than 50 years ago in the desolate interior of northeast
Brazil, there rode an outlaw named Lampiao, who wore a large leather
hat with a broad brim turned up in front and back. Fringe and strings
of beads hung from the brim. Lampiao and his comrades, vigilantes of
the sertao, or back lands, ransacked farms, killed those who got in
their way and seemed unstoppable until they were finally ambushed and
gunned down by government troops.</LD>
<LD>   Time has tamed the image of the feared bandit Lampiao and turned
him into a major icon of the Festa Juninas  celebration in Caruaru, a
picturesque artisan town about 1,600 miles north of Rio de Janeiro.
In June, Caruaru swells from a sleepy town of a quarter of a million
residents to more than a million as visitors from around the world
arrive for the annual Big Party. Festa Juninas dazzles with
fireworks, food and forro, a type of Brazilian music that keeps
partygoers dancing until dawn.</LD>
<TE>   When my husband, Lewis Campbell, and I visited Caruaru last June,
it was a journey to a territory I had been traversing for some time,
if only in literature. I had been studying and translating literatura
de cordel, or "stories on a string"--folk ballads printed in
pamphlets that were strung on clotheslines across poets' stalls and
sold in the open marketplaces of northeastern Brazil. Part of a
fading folkloric tradition, these ballads of human folly involve
simple country folk, talking animals and Catholic saints.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, I lived for a time with my grandmother in Brazil. I
remembered Festa Juninas and the frilly traditional costumes my
grandmother made for my sister and me for the celebration. An uncle
took us to see the fireworks arc across the sky. In a sense,
returning to Brazil during Festa Juninas was returning home.</TE>
<TE>   The better-known Carnival, held before Lent in Rio and elsewhere
in Brazil, is an all-out glorification of carnal delights, a
celebration of the wild id that changes dramatically into the
superego come Ash Wednesday. Festa Juninas, on the other hand,
celebrates the ego, the constancy of life and hard work. The festival
originated in pre-Christian Europe to honor the harvest and
fertility, and came to Brazil with the Portuguese.</TE>
<TE>   Besides its festival, Caruaru is known for its ceramic figurines,
considered a major form of Brazilian folk art, and for its
twice-weekly market, one of the largest in northeastern Brazil, held
Wednesdays and Saturdays. The city can be visited during a day trip
from Recife, a budding resort capital 95 miles away that is known as
the Brazilian Venice.</TE>
<TE>   Part of our stay included Recife, Brazil's fourth largest city.
The colonial section of town huddles by the coast; the rest sprawls
around three rivers, connected by several brightly painted bridges.
My husband and I stayed in Boa Viagem, the hotel zone, which has a
beach that rivals those in Rio.</TE>
<TE>   Settled by the Portuguese in the first decade of the 1500s, Recife
was used as a harbor for ships transporting harvested brazilwood to
Europe. Sugar mills were established in the early 1530s, and the area
rapidly became one of the most important sugar-growing regions in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   In the interior, owners of large estates raised cattle, initially
to supply sugar workers with food. These isolated estates gave rise
to a unique population of flamboyant cowboys, wandering outlaws and
African slaves. Some of the slaves escaped and established
independent communities. They named one of these communities Kau'lu,
after an herb brought from their African homeland. "Kau'lu" evolved
into the name Caruaru (pronounced car-u-a-RU).</TE>
<TE>   The city sits in a small valley in the heart of the Agreste, a
part of Brazil that gets some of the moisture of the coast yet hints
at the harsher landscape of the sertao. To get here, we took a
two-hour bus ride from Recife. We passed rolling hills of sugar cane,
patches of thick bromeliads and clusters of palm and banana trees.
The lushness gave way to stubbier vegetation and cactus. Donkey carts
shared the road with speeding cars, and goats grazed nonchalantly in
empty lots that doubled as soccer fields. We watched while a man
tried to harness a runaway pig, the animal clearly winning as it
dragged its master through the mud.</TE>
<TE>   Festa Juninas was everywhere. Rows of small flags were strung
around town squares and across alleyways, attached to trees, windows
and eaves. Baloes, colorful balloon-like lanterns, hung from
lampposts.</TE>
<TE>   The images of this harvest festival are pure matuto, which
translates as "country bumpkin." During Festa Juninas, even the most
ardent city dweller longs for the farm. Straw hats and fringed
leather hats a la Lampiao appear on the heads of refrigerator
salesmen, TV cooking show hosts and jitney drivers. Lampiao also
appears on billboards advertising Burger King and rock music radio
stations.</TE>
<TE>   But the Festa Juninas is actually the celebration of three saints.
Street parties start June 13, Dia de Namorados, or Sweethearts Day,
which is also the day of St. Anthony of Padua. For the next two weeks
the frenzy increases, reaching the height of country-style bliss on
the Dia de Sao Joao, feast day of St. John the Baptist, on June 24.
Things start to wind down on June 29, the day of St. Peter.</TE>
<TE>   In Caruaru, the St. John's Day party became so big that the city
built a special fairgrounds, the Vila do Forro, for the annual event.
Food booths offer grilled meat, roasted corn, shrimp or tripe soup
and my favorite Brazilian alcoholic drink, caipirinhas, made with
limes, sugar and cachaca, a wonderful rum that gives your lips a
blissful numbness. Open-air dance halls compete for space with a
chapel where people manage to pray despite the hubbub.</TE>
<TE>   A festival of fertility, Festa Juninas features children as a star
attraction. Little boys wear patchwork pants and neck bandannas.
Their faces are painted with signs of manhood--small pointed
mustaches and smears of 5 o'clock shadow. Little girls blossom in
gingham and flowered dresses with puffed sleeves, ruffles and
ribbons. Swirls of rouge and fake freckles decorate their cheeks. Was
this really what I looked like many years ago wearing my blue
eyelet-trimmed dress?</TE>
<TE>   We stayed at the spartan but clean Center Plaza Hotel, close to
the festival grounds. With the windows open, music drifted in from
shops along the street. The daily buffet featured regional favorites:
sun-cured beef, boiled cassava, stewed chicken, fried bananas and
scene-stealing cakes. There are good reasons they call the northeast
sugar country.</TE>
<TE>   On the second day of the St. John's celebration, we went to the
festival grounds to see the parade of the bacamarteiros, battalions
of mock soldiers dressed in fringed leather hats with cartridge belts
slung over their shoulders. They carried rifles modeled after those
used by army troops during Brazil's war with Paraguay in 1865. The
soldiers arrived at a dusty empty lot, milled around and chatted.
When they felt ready, a few ambled out, held their rifles above their
heads and fired blanks into the air. At the end, this gentle army did
nothing more than fill the air with booming sounds, the smell of
gunpowder and clouds of dust.</TE>
<TE>   During the weekend celebrations, quadrille groups of young adult
couples dressed in colorful clothes promenaded through crowds that
rapidly parted for them. The quadrille originated as a 19th century
European court dance, but once it arrived in the open frontier of
Brazil, the polite hush of the palaces let loose with the shouts of
the marcante, or dance caller. Couples circled, swirled, wove
together, broke apart and rejoined.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those who visit Festa Juninas do a different type of
dance, the forro. Caruaru has crowned itself the "Capital of Forro"
after the kicky but melancholy music that is the lifeblood of the
northeast. Although forro has European origins, the sound is
unmistakably regional in its primary instruments--accordion, triangle
and zabumba drum, with the occasional addition of guitar, tambourine
and other percussion.</TE>
<TE>   Partners dancing the forro snuggle tightly, the man's leg slipping
between the woman's legs to varying degrees. In a more conservative
rendition, the knees kiss; in the sensational, stomach-rubbing
rela-buxo, they embrace. The young couples dance their forro in
double time and insert a few extra hip wiggles into the beat. Older
women, who have the short, square-shaped build of their ancestors,
dance affectionately with their tired, lean-faced men. The drunk
dance while holding beer cans or bottles of scotch. More affluent
Brazilians from Sao Paulo and Rio dance in pressed khakis and silk
scarves. Because the forro is danced almost in place, a small floor
can heat up with a lot of forrozeiros. All night long, fireworks
glitter over the churning masses.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you don't have to arrive during Festa Juninas to
dance--or to learn more about the forro. The Vila do Forro houses a
forro museum that is open all year round. The building also houses
the Museu do Barro, a ceramic museum that displays the best examples
of the painted figures for which Caruaru is famous.</TE>
<TE>   The forro museum honors the father of northeastern music, Luiz
Gonzaga, revered for his ability to chronicle the hard life of the
northeasterner. His most famous lament, "Asa Branca" (White Wing),
tells about a migrant who has fled his drought-ridden farm but who
waits for rain so he can return to the land and the woman he loves. I
grew up with Gonzaga's warm voice playing on my parents' phonograph
every Sunday afternoon. I was delighted when I saw the lyrics to "Asa
Branca" posted on a display board so that everyone could sing the
words.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, the ceramic museum contains many figures done by Mestre
Vitalino, Caruaru's master craftsman. Some of the statues are quaint,
such as women feeding chickens and pipe-smoking grandmothers riding
donkeys; some are political, such as black maids nursing white
infants, and men and women toiling in the sugar fields.</TE>
<TE>   Four miles outside town and easily accessible by city bus or car
is the tiny artisan village of Alto do Moura, which we visited twice.
The small shops are populated with figurines for sale, with prices
ranging from a few dollars to a couple of hundred. If waiters at the
open-air cafes seem a bit slow, not to worry. Throngs of street
vendors wander around the lunchtime crowd, selling cashews and salted
shrimp to stave off hunger.</TE>
<TE>   While we waited our turn, my tall, northern European-looking
husband caught the eye of a repentista, or balladeer. These singers
are very much a part of northeast Brazilian folklore. They improvise
on the spot. In a distinctive nasal singsong style, the repentista
told a tall tale of our journey and gently teased, "Perhaps these
Americans brought some money with them?" Even though my husband
doesn't speak Portuguese, he knew he had no choice but to pay up.</TE>
<TE>   Around the northeast, I saw a couple of cars with bumper stickers
that proclaimed: "Sou orgullo ser um Nordestino." (I'm proud to be a
Northeasterner.) Festa Juninas harks back to a simpler time of honest
farm work and uncomplicated lives. For the month of June, all Brazil
is "proud to be Nordestino."</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: Carousing in Caruaru</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: There are no nonstop flights from Southern
California to northeast Brazil. American and United fly to Sao Paulo,
connecting in Miami. From there, take Varig to Recife. Alternatively,
fly Varig to Rio de Janeiro with one stop, then to Recife; or Varig
nonstop to Sao Paulo, then TAM Linhas Aeras to Recife. Restricted
round-trip fares begin at $847.</TE>
<TE>   Buses from Recife to Caruaru leave from Terminal Integrado de
Passageiros, the TIP terminal, for the two- to three-hour trip. The
cost is about $8.50 one way. Lines are long during Festa Juninas
weekends, so buy your passage early. Make sure you also obtain a
boarding ticket, or cartao de embarque, with your bus ticket,
ingresso or bilhete.</TE>
<TE>   To drive to Caruaru, take the BR-232 freeway going west.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation in Caruaru is cheap, and there are plenty of buses.
Taxis line up by the bus station and in front of hotels. A taxi ride
from the bus depot to downtown costs about $2.50.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones: To call the numbers below, dial 011 (the international
dialing code), 55 (the country code), 81 (the regional code) and the
local phone number.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: In Recife, the Hotel do Sol is on beautiful Boa
Viagem beach. You can buy a bus ticket to Caruaru with your
reservation and avoid waiting in line at the terminal: 978 Av. Boa
Viagem; 3091-0991, www.hsol.com.br. Doubles $32, ocean view about
$40.</TE>
<TE>   Hotels in Caruaru sell two- to three-night packages during St.
John's weekend. Reserve well ahead. The e-mail response time is one
to two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel do Sol in Caruaru, 3721-3044, www.hsol.com.br, is part of
the same northeast Brazil chain as the hotel recommended in Recife.
It is at the intersection of routes 104 and 232, a three-minute drive
from the center of Caruaru. Festival packages for doubles are $143
for three nights, $118 for two nights. At other times of the year,
doubles are about $50. Big breakfasts are included.</TE>
<TE>   Center Plaza Hotel, 84 Rua 7 de Setembro, 3722-4011,
www.caruaru.com.br/hoteis.htm, is walking distance to the
festivities. Its three-night festival package is $215 double with
breakfast and a buffet dinner.</TE>
<TE>   You can find basic information about the Center Plaza Hotel and
Hotel do Sol at www.hotel.com.br. In the box Cidade, type Caruaru.</TE>
<TE>   Where to eat: Buffet dining is the rage in the northeast. In
Caruaru, try Mestre Vitalino, 13 Rua Leao Dourado, 3721-0499, for
local favorites. If you're looking for a break from regional foods,
try the Italian cuisine at Restaurante Giardino, 151 Rua Oswaldo;
3723-6049. Their specialty is filet mignon with Madeira sauce.</TE>

<HD>Adventure Tours Where Disabled Travelers Can Participate
With the Gang</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARTHUR FROMMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After decades of receiving little assistance from the commercial
vacation industry, travelers with disabilities now can turn to a
variety of specialty tour operators who compete for their business
and operate programs designed just for them.</LD>
<LD>   Although this is progress, some individuals with disabilities
prefer to vacation in the general travel world and not in segregated
groups. Similarly, some able-bodied travelers vacation alongside
people with disabilities: Their spouse might be in a wheelchair or
their sibling might have multiple sclerosis, and finding a trip that
is suitable for both is a problem.</LD>
<LD>   Enter two travel operators whose adventurous tours serve these
needs with vacations that integrate travelers who have disabilities
with those who are fully able. Wilderness Inquiry is a 30-year-old
nonprofit that organizes outdoor adventures for a broad mix of people
in search of nature and--in canoeing, hiking or kayaking--one
another. The organization's aim is to "reduce stereotypes and empower
people to push their perceived limitations."</LD>
<TE>   Wilderness Inquiry has hosted people of all levels of mobility and
types of disabilities, including those who are quadriplegic, deaf,
blind and developmentally disabled. (A recent kayaking group sailing
to Isle Royale in Lake Superior was composed of three staff members,
four able-bodied participants, a camper with cerebral palsy, a blind
person, a person with a severe heart condition and another who had
sustained a traumatic brain injury.)</TE>
<TE>   The trips are rugged but relaxed in their pace. Most involve
camping. Participants are expected to help out with daily chores
(cooking, pitching tents, cleaning up) according to their abilities.
Wilderness Inquiry's trips usually cost $100 to $150 a day, and the
price covers all meals, equipment, instruction and staff. A
five-night sea kayaking trip in Washington state's San Juan Islands
costs $645 for one of six departure dates in August and September. A
five-night canoeing trip in New York's Adirondack Mountains is $625,
also in August and September. Kayaking in Utah's Glen Canyon National
Recreation Area costs $750 for a five-night trip in October.</TE>
<TE>   Several adventures are also organized especially for families,
such as the Superior National Forest Family Canoe itinerary, a
four-night paddling adventure through lakes and rivers of Minnesota
in July and August. The cost is $475 for adults and $235 for children
16 and younger.</TE>
<TE>   Contact Wilderness Inquiry, 808 14th Ave. S.E., Minneapolis, MN
55414; (800) 728-0719, www.wildernessinquiry.org.</TE>
<TE>   Ever dreamed of sailing aboard a 19th century-style tall ship?
England's Jubilee Sailing Trust can deliver a unique experience on
the sea for a mixed group of able-bodied persons accompanying others
with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's two ships, the Tenacious and the Lord Nelson,
look like ships used hundreds of years ago but were carefully
designed with the needs of disabled travelers in mind. They have
flat, wide, wheelchair-friendly decks, lifts between decks for those
who cannot negotiate steps or ladders, extra-large washing facilities
and signs in Braille.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 people (a maximum of 20 may have disabilities) become
crew members on the ships, and each person must keep a four-hour
watch every 16 hours on the seas. Most Jubilee participants with
disabilities use wheelchairs, but a variety of people with
disabilities take part.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 trips are offered each year, most sailing in the region
of the English Channel, with an occasional journey to Lisbon; Nice,
France; Monte Carlo; or Dublin, Ireland. Most trips last between
three days and one week and average from $150 to $200 per day.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, contact Jubilee Sailing Trust, Hazel Road,
Woolston, Southampton, SO19 7GB; 011-44-23-8044-9108, www.jst.org.uk.</TE>
<TE>   An excellent resource for the disabled traveler is the Society for
Accessible Travel and Hospitality, or SATH, 347 Fifth Ave., Suite
610, New York, NY 10016; (212) 447-7284, www.sath.org. It publishes a
periodical called "Open World," filled with travel-related articles
and advertisements for people with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, individuals with disabilities who wish to go abroad for
an extended volunteer, research or study program should contact
Mobility International USA, P.O. Box 10767, Eugene, OR 97440; (541)
343-1284, www.miusa.org, which will research the facilities of
whatever institution you're interested in.</TE>

<HD>Changes Afoot for Summer Visitors to Yosemite Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You may want to schedule your summer trek to Yosemite National Park
earlier rather than later this summer because Yosemite Falls is
expected to peak early, and access to Half Dome will be restricted
starting in July.</LD>
<LD>   The waterfall was expected to reach its maximum flow this weekend
or Memorial Day weekend, somewhat earlier than usual because of the
warm spring and a snowpack that is about 5% below average in the
park, spokeswoman Deb Schweizer said last week. The falls generally
run from January or February to October and reach peak flow in June,
she said.</LD>
<LD>   Climbing cables for Half Dome were expected to be up by this
weekend (barring a last-minute storm), permitting ascent to the top.
But from July 8 through Sept. 19, the final mile or so of the trail
will be closed 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays for repairs
to the rock stairs, Schweizer said; the trail will continue to be
fully open on weekends.</LD>
<TE>   A downside to an early-summer visit to Yosemite is that there may
be traffic delays on the park's Northside Drive in the next few weeks
because of installation of a sewer line, Schweizer added. Vehicles
will initially be confined to one lane, then later rerouted to
Southside Drive between El Capitan and the Pohono Bridge.</TE>

<HD>Priceline Adds Air-Hotel Packages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Jane Engle</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internet travel auctioneer Priceline.com (www.priceline.com) last
week began offering vacation packages. They include air and hotel
only.</LD>
<LD>   Site visitors choose the hotel, the length of stay, dates and
amount they want to pay for the trip, including air fare.</LD>
<LD>   Priceline chooses the airline and flight and discloses them only
after your bid is accepted (although it says it will ask your
permission if the best itinerary includes more than one connection or
flights that arrive after midnight). Like all Priceline products, the
trip is nonrefundable.</LD>
<TE>   Another caveat: Although Priceline says travelers get to choose
"the exact hotel they want," they are limited to a list provided by
Priceline, generally major chains. For instance, for a trip to
Chicago from June 5 to 13 researched last week, the site offered four
hotels: a Hyatt, a Marriott, Courtyard by Marriott and a Residence
Inn.</TE>
<TE>   Priceline markets airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and,
since February, cruises.</TE>

<HD>Dengue Fever Outbreak Under Control in Hawaii</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Jane Engle</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dengue fever outbreak in Hawaii that began last year has been
brought under control, the Hawaii Department of Health said earlier
this month.</LD>
<LD>   The state's last confirmed case of the mosquito-borne illness,
which can cause high fever, rash, joint and muscle pain and other
symptoms, was Feb. 9, said spokeswoman Janice Okubo. A total of 119
cases, mostly on Maui plus a few on Oahu and Kauai, has been recorded
since May 31, 2001, she said.</LD>
<LD>   Before this outbreak, Hawaii had not had a locally transmitted
case of dengue fever since World War II.</LD>

<LD>MURTEN, Switzerland--Imaginative. Inspirational. Innovative. Immense.
And very, very late.</LD>
<LD>   Switzerland's national exhibition, which opened last week and runs
through Oct. 20, looks as though it's set to be everything that its
cautious, meticulous, tiny host nation is not.</LD>
<LD>   About 5 million people are expected to attend Expo.02, which is
scattered over three lakes and four towns (Biel, Murten, Neuchatel
and Yverdon-les-Bains) in a scenic region off the usual tourist
track. The festival is held about once in a generation; the last was
in 1964.</LD>
<TE>   "It will be a gigantic party in which Switzerland invites itself
and the world to rediscover the world," says Expo.02 chairwoman Nelly
Wenger.</TE>
<TE>   A highlight is a massive artificial cloud above Lake Neuchatel by
New York architects Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio. The
cloud's steel structure incorporates a network of 33,000 jets that
spray tiny droplets of water.</TE>
<TE>   The festival was postponed for a year by financial and management
problems. One-day admission is about $30 adults, $15 children 6 to
16, free under 6. 011-41-900-020-202, www.expo.02.ch.</TE>

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>Before Silicon Valley, There Was San Jose</HD>
<DH>Seeking out history, Asian and otherwise, in California's
oldest city</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>I told friends I was planning a trip to San Jose. "Are you going
there for anything in particular?" they asked politely.</LD>
<LD>   "History," I answered. That drew the same kind of blank stare I
used to get when I lived on the East Coast and told
people--sincerely--that I missed Los Angeles for its cultural
vitality.</LD>
<LD>   But despite its position as the capital of Silicon Valley, San
Jose has more to offer than the hustle of high tech. The city is also
California's oldest, and as I found out with my family last month,
it's a great place to explore the state's rich and varied heritage.
My wife, Shiru, and daughter, Elly, and I proved it is possible to
balance fun for a child with a meaningful experience for parents.</LD>
<TE>   After flying up from Burbank on a Friday evening, we began our
date with history at our downtown hotel, the Hyatt Sainte Claire. The
Sainte Claire opened in 1926, touted as the "million-dollar hotel"
because its construction cost was extravagant for that era. Over the
years, the elegant Spanish and Italian Renaissance Revival building
deteriorated into a decrepit flophouse until it was restored in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Sainte
Claire masterfully combines luxury and good taste. Its lobby is
adorned with gilt scrollwork, Italianate furniture and dark wood
ceiling beams framing hand-painted panels. The rooms are full of fine
details. Elly, 2, especially liked the painted bathroom ceiling
depicting doves in a blue sky filled with milky clouds.</TE>
<TE>   The service, however, wasn't as competent as the restoration work.
When I booked the room online (a weekend rate of $99 plus tax per
night), I had made sure to reserve a king bed and a rollaway. This
detail was bungled repeatedly by the staff, which couldn't get us the
right room until our second night, after several requests. I finally
complained to the manager, who, though not aware I was a reporter,
graciously didn't charge us for the first night and gave us free
breakfast coupons.</TE>
<TE>   So we set out Saturday exhausted by a nearly sleepless night in a
noisy room with cramped double beds. The front desk told me the noise
was part of the hotel's "European style," an excuse that brought
Continental curse words to mind as we groggily headed out to another
annoyance: The hotel staff had been evasive when I asked about
alternatives to the $15-a-day valet parking. I later learned that
weekend parking is free in a city lot across the street. But onward
we went to Japantown.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose's Japantown emerged at the start of the 20th century in
an area that also had housed the city's third Chinatown. (The first
two were burned under suspicious circumstances during periods of
anti-Chinese hostility; the third simply faded with demographic
shifts.)</TE>
<TE>   The section of Jackson Street between 1st and 7th streets is a
living reminder of California's Asian heritage. As journalist Carey
McWilliams noted in 1946, commercial fishing and farming in
California were industries built largely by not just the labor of
Asians but by their know-how and capital as well.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1800s, Asians already constituted nearly a third of San
Jose's population. Japantown was a thriving business district by
1902. Today Japantown's modest shops and restaurants form a quaint,
small-town kind of scene in a mostly residential neighborhood a few
blocks north of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Our initial stop was to pick up food for a picnic lunch. At a
carryout place on Jackson called Bento Xpress, we bought sushi rolls,
a cold noodle somen salad and gyoza potstickers. Properly stocked for
lunch, we ventured a mile or so to Kelley Park, where we visited two
attractions: History Park, a collection of 27 historic buildings
forming a replica of an old town, complete with a running trolley;
and the Happy Hollow Park and Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Happy Hollow is a brilliantly executed playground for kids 2 to
10. There are rides, including two merry-go-rounds and a locomotive,
as well as puppet shows and plenty of grassy open space. Unlike
commercial theme parks, nonprofit Happy Hollow is peaceful and sane,
with few lines and an admission fee of $4.50 per person. (Visitors
younger than 2 and older than 75 are free.)</TE>
<TE>   The small zoo is just right for young children. A jaguar, lemurs,
meerkats and monkeys live in pens designed to give little ones
unobstructed views. There's a model Vietnamese farm with potbellied
pigs. Elly especially liked the "contact area," which has an open
petting zoo with adorable baby goats, chickens and guinea pigs.</TE>
<TE>   After our picnic, we moved on to History Park. Reconstructed city
landmarks and old houses moved to the site form a pleasant village
overlooking the valley. The village hub is the turn-of-the-century
Pacific Hotel, which contains a museum gallery and gift shop.</TE>
<TE>   Next door is the Banca d'Italia, the reconstructed first branch of
what became Bank of America. The park also houses Ng Shing Gung, a
replica of a Chinatown temple built in 1888.</TE>
<TE>   The park is a great place for a stroll, but we especially enjoyed
riding the electric trolley. Rebuilt by volunteers, the trolley car
is a beauty, with reversible seats, wood-framed windows and period
advertising cards. The park also has early cars on exhibit, including
a Model T and a 1916 electric car with a remarkable 70-mile range.</TE>
<TE>   Our History Park visit ended with a trip to O'Brien's Ice Cream
Parlor, a re-creation of a shop that operated in San Jose from 1868
to 1956.</TE>
<TE>   While Elly and Shiru napped at the hotel, I took a short drive to
the last remnant of San Jose's original pueblo, the adobe house built
by Luis Maria Peralta in 1797. The two-room cottage is a hidden gem,
apparently even for locals. I was the only one on my tour.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie, my volunteer guide, didn't mind and proceeded with
enthusiasm, recounting Peralta's rise from pioneer to millionaire
land baron, all while living in the same tiny shack in which we
stood.</TE>
<TE>   We then moved across the street to the ornate Victorian built by
San Jose Mayor Thomas Fallon in 1855. By moving from one house to
another, we crossed from San Jose's Spanish-Mexican era to its
Anglo-American period, a move Charlie dramatized by changing from a
poncho to a morning coat. As such close neighbors, Charlie said,
Fallon and Peralta no doubt knew each other, but the austere Spaniard
and the flamboyant Irish immigrant were clearly worlds apart in style
and tastes, if not fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   After that excellent account of 19th century California history, I
returned to Japantown. The neighborhood has its own sights for
history buffs, including a small museum and sidewalk plaques with
pictures and notes on events such as the World War II internment of
San Jose residents.</TE>
<TE>   I window-shopped at quirky places such as Hank's Custom Rod and
Reel Shop and Soko Ace Hardware, which had an impressive collection
of Asian cookware and a display of the elaborate toilets popular in
Japan, with heated seats and electronically controlled warm-water
bidets.</TE>
<TE>   At Nikaku Japanese Arts, a second-story gift shop with a wide
selection of Japanese animation videos, I picked up a tape of the
1960s Japanese TV cartoon "Kimba the White Lion," which I had heard
about.</TE>
<TE>   Animation buffs believe Disney ripped off "Kimba" to create "The
Lion King." Disney insists similarities, such as the character name
Simba, are coincidence. If anything supports Disney's argument, it's
the depth of the Japanese show. The "Kimba" episodes deal with
justice and morality, never presuming children deserve only light
entertainment. For Elly, I chose a "Kimba" tape titled "Freedom and
Responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   We all returned to Japantown for dinner at Okayama, a 35-year-old
neighborhood spot featuring standards like the beef sukiyaki, chicken
teriyaki and chirashi sushi we ordered. Okayama and the rest of
Japantown reminded me of neighborhoods like Baltimore's Little
Italy--a place where storefronts display fliers for the Veterans of
Foreign Wars bento lunch sale and the Young Buddhists Assn. spring
musical.</TE>
<TE>   Okayama is the Japanese American equivalent of the red-sauce
Italian restaurant, where civic clubs meet for lunch and company
softball teams celebrate victories. The food was substantial and
consistent, with nice touches like freshly made tofu from the San
Jose Tofu Co. across the street. There were also endearing gestures
by the staff--for instance, a waitress brought Elly chopsticks
fastened together with a rubber band, making them easier to use with
her little fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, after breakfast at the hotel, we took a quick walk to the
magnificent Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph nearby. The current
building was constructed in 1876, but the parish was established in
1803.</TE>
<TE>   Between services, visitors are welcome to marvel at the
cathedral's interior, full of sculpture and stained glass. Eight
saints are depicted in panels circling the 70-foot-high domed
ceiling. In the loft sits an organ, built in 1886 and featuring more
than 1,500 pipes.</TE>
<TE>   We made one last stop in Japantown for lunches to take on the
plane. At Santo Market, a grocery store with a Hawaiian-style deli,
we picked up three box lunches with broiled mackerel, black-bean pork
ribs and string beans wrapped in beef teriyaki.</TE>
<TE>   During our flight back, I considered the cost of our trip. We
spent a few dollars on admission fees, and no one pushed overpriced
souvenirs. The historic sites were maintained by volunteers,
motivated only by their desire to teach us about California's
history.</TE>
<TE>   I doubt Elly learned any history, and I didn't expect her to. But
she did have fun, and someday not too far off, she will see that
there are people who spend their weekends keeping up places that
connect us to our past and, by extension, to one another. Their work
enriches us, and our visits are their reward.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shedding a little light on the subject is easier, thanks to the
following items. Items may be available in area stores. Prices do not
include shipping.</LD>
<LD>   Good read: Most book lights provide a narrow spotlight from a
little bulb and rapidly consume batteries. Not the Fluorescent Itty
Bitty book light from Zelco, the company that pioneered mini-book
lights. This light, which clips to a book's back jacket, has a
2-inch-long permanent fluorescent tube that casts white light over an
even, wide area. And it's no battery hog: When I tested it, the light
stayed on for nine hours on two AA batteries. It folds down to 6 by
11/4 by 1 inch and weighs 4 ounces.</LD>
<LD>   Zelco Fluorescent Itty Bitty book light is $40. For information:
(800) 431-2486, www.zelco.com.</LD>
<TE>   Head trip: Hikers and campers value miner's-style headlamps for
hands-free illumination. The Moonlight Headlamp from Black Diamond
Equipment is a small, lightweight variation that provides 70 hours of
light from four LED bulbs, powered by three AAA batteries. A swivel
lets the wearer direct the beam, and the headband is adjustable. The
Moonlight is as useful for navigating on dark streets or changing a
tire at night as it is for outdoor adventures.</TE>
<TE>   Moonlight Headlamp is $34.50. Information: (801) 278-5533,
www.blackdiamondequipment.com.</TE>
<TE>   Taskmaster: About the size of a matchbook, the 0-4 Mini Task Light
provides something many key-chain lights do not--a switch to keep the
light on. The light, waterproof to 10 feet, will shine for 12 to 14
hours on two replaceable lithium batteries. It's available in
graphite black and in bright colors, and it comes with a key ring for
attaching to a key chain.</TE>
<TE>   0-4 Mini Task Light is $16. For information: (888) 699-0622,
www.cmgequipment.com.</TE>
<TE>   Beam team: A mini flashlight is one of the 16 items that make up
the versatile little Midnite MiniChamp II, the newest Swiss Army
knife from Victorinox. Also housed in the
21/2-by-1/2-by-5/8-inch-thick base are a blade, scissors, flat and
Phillips screwdriver, nail file, ruler, wire stripper, cap lifter,
cuticle pusher, retractable pen and more. The tiny light, which
operates on a button battery, turns on when you push the Swiss cross
insignia. The attached key ring keeps everything handy. It weighs
less than 2 ounces.</TE>
<TE>   Midnite MiniChamp II in red or blue is $38. For information: Swiss
Army Brands, (800) 442-2706, www.swissarmy.com.</TE>
<TE>   Glowing gem: The 2-inch-long Sapphire Wearable Light shines a
bright blue beam with a 180-degree viewing radius, and it is visible
up to a mile away in clear weather. The light, available in red,
violet, black, pewter, blue or gold, clips onto parkas, key rings or
any ring. The sapphire crystal LED lamp is guaranteed for 100,000
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Sapphire Wearable Light is $14.95 from the Container Store. For
information: (888) 266-8246, www.containerstore.com.</TE>

<HD>Mt. Wilson Through the Back Door</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most hikers think of Mt. Wilson as the backdrop to Pasadena and the
San Gabriel Valley. Almost always, we climb the mountain from the
south following century-old routes, the Old Mt. Wilson Trail and the
Old Mt. Wilson Toll Road.</LD>
<LD>   Few hikers think of the other side--the north face of the
mountain--where steep slopes cloaked in a magnificent forest await.
Does this sound intriguing?</LD>
<LD>   It is. But there's a catch. Why else would nearly all hikers climb
from the south?</LD>
<TE>   The catch is that the trail for a northerly climb of Mt. Wilson
starts from an unlikely place: the top of Mt. Wilson. To ascend the
mountain on this side, you must first drive to the peak, then descend
it. And it's not a minor descent, but a steep, knee-jarring walk down
to the west fork of the San Gabriel River. Then, of course, you must
climb back to the summit, where you parked.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime San Gabriel Mountains hikers know the reason for this
awkward route. The Forest Service closed the road that leads from
California 2 (Angeles Crest Highway) to West Fork Campground years
ago. When or whether this road will reopen is anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   Most maps show the old Rattlesnake Trail slithering down Mt.
Wilson's north slope. A few years ago this serpentine path was
renamed Kenyon DeVore Trail in honor of a man who spent most of the
20th century working in the San Gabriel Mountains. DeVore (1911-1995)
was raised at his parents' trail resort on the west fork. He led mule
trains that brought supplies to mountain dwellers; then he worked for
the county flood control district in San Gabriel Canyon. In
retirement he was a Forest Service volunteer at the Chantry Flat
information center.</TE>
<TE>   The hike I'm describing this week follows Kenyon DeVore and
Gabrielino trails to the West Fork Campground, then doubles back.
(Hikers can fashion a loop instead by following the Gabrielino Trail
west to Valley Forge Trail heading south. The trail intersects Mt.
Wilson-Red Box Road, leaving about two miles of walking along the
road back to the trail head.)</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon DeVore Trail is in so-so shape. Expect some washouts and
erosion on some of the switchbacks. Also remember to have a Forest
Service Adventure Pass for your car, available at locations
throughout the region; call Angeles National Forest (see map box) for
a location near you.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From Interstate 210 in La Canada
Flintridge, take California 2 and follow it 14 miles to Mt.
Wilson-Red Box Road. Turn right and continue 41/4 miles toward the
summit. Just before the top, the road splits and becomes one way,
with traffic flowing counterclockwise. At the road split, you will
spot the sign for Kenyon DeVore Trail on the left, but you will need
to follow the road to a turnout for parking about 100 yards above the
trail head.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: The path descends among the first of many stands of oak.
As the trail drops farther into the shady recesses of Strayns Canyon,
look for big-cone spruce, incense cedar and Jeffrey and sugar pine.</TE>
<TE>   The trail crosses Strayns Creek, contours along the east side of
the canyon, then crosses the water again to the west side. Eventually
you will reach a junction with the Gabrielino Trail. Turn east and
head down the canyon to West Fork Campground, which offers tables,
toilets and a place to rest for the long ascent up Mt. Wilson.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii's Siren Song Is Louder This Summer</HD>
<DH>A likely visitor upsurge is prompting airlines to add
seats. Some hotel packages are costlier, but bargains can still be
found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When West Hollywood resident Peter Hoffman and his friend Orlando
first visited Hawaii two years ago, they stayed in a "too impersonal,
too big" chain hotel in what Hoffman calls the "madness" of Waikiki.
The two will return this month and will stay at the quieter, smaller
124-room New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel at the foot of Diamond Head.</LD>
<LD>   Why Hawaii again? "I was going to New York, but Hawaii sounded a
lot more relaxing," Hoffman says. "We're both under a lot of stress,
and we just had to get away." Oahu was appealing "because it was
familiar--I had scoped it out," Hoffman says. They booked the
weeklong trip in early April through a travel agent, paying $356 per
person round trip from LAX to Honolulu and $248 a night for their
one-bedroom suite with balcony.</LD>
<LD>   The pair should have plenty of company. Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a
network of more than 1,000 travel agency offices, reports a "real
uptick" in interest in Hawaii, and "all indications are we are ahead
of last year" in bookings for the peak summer season, says spokesman
Steve Loucks.</LD>
<TE>   Airlines, betting heavily on more visitors, are adding 490,000
seats to the islands from the mainland this summer, about 10% more
than last year and 3% more than 2000, a record year for Hawaii
visitors, says Chris Kam, director of market trends for the Hawaii
Visitors &amp; Convention Bureau. Passenger arrivals from the mainland in
April were nearly back to normal (93.9% of April 2001 levels),
despite a precipitous drop-off after the Sept. 11 attacks, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman and his friend personify some of the reasons for Hawaii's
popularity this year: It's an exotic yet familiar domestic
destination that offers stressed-out workers and families a chance to
lounge on the beach. With post-Sept. 11 jitters about world travel
and the economic dislocations of the last couple of years, those are
powerful appeals. The fear of flying, which devastated island tourism
for weeks after Sept. 11, "for the most part ... seems to have gone
away" in the last three or four months, says Michael Hannan, owner of
San Marin Travel in Novato, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The prospective visitor upsurge from the mainland, while injecting
hope into the islands' tourist-dependent economy, has downsides and
upsides for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   As Hoffman discovered, there are some inexpensive air fares,
especially before the peak July-August months. Starting in June,
airlines will add more flights, including nonstops to neighbor
islands from the western U.S., giving travelers more options and so
far, in some but not all cases, lower fares than last summer.</TE>
<TE>   As for lodging and packages, the picture is mixed; it depends on
where you're going and how highbrow you want to go. Your best chance
of finding deals, as always, is with packages, even though some of
those are pricier this year than last. For independent travelers,
Oahu offers more bargains than Kauai, the Big Island and, to some
extent, Maui. On any island, and especially in Waikiki, you may find
discounts at upper-end lodgings, says Joseph Toy, president of
Hospitality Advisors Inc. and a longtime expert on the Hawaiian
market.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some specifics:</TE>
<TE>   * Getting there by air: The big news here is the collapse this
spring of the proposed merger of Hawaiian and Aloha airlines. Now
"they're trying to open routes to compete with each other," Toy says.
Travelers have more choices.</TE>
<TE>   On June 1 Aloha will begin new daily nonstops to Honolulu from
Burbank and Vancouver, Canada. On June 7 Hawaiian starts flying daily
nonstops to Honolulu from Ontario, Calif., and Sacramento. New
nonstops by the major airlines include United's between Kona on the
Big Island and San Francisco (June 7) and American's between Kauai
and LAX (June 15).</TE>
<TE>   The new flights reflect an increase in Hawaii travel from the
western U.S., which sent 3.2% more visitors there in March (the
latest figures) than in March 2001, Kam says. By contrast, there were
8.5% fewer visitors from the eastern U.S. and 17.2% fewer from Japan.
Competition usually drives fares down, and that seems to be working
in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   Fares available in early May for July travel between Burbank and
Honolulu, Maui and Kauai have dropped more than 40% compared with
last summer, according to a spot check of the lowest advance,
restricted round-trip air fares by Bob Harrell of Harrell Associates,
which tracks fares through the database used to supply travel agents.
(Note that such air fares change many times daily and may no longer
be available.)</TE>
<TE>   Tom Parsons, editor of www.bestfares.com, and Randy Petersen,
editor and publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, say it may be somewhat
easier this year to redeem frequent-flier miles to
Hawaii--especially, Parsons says, if you avoid Saturday departures
and are flexible on dates and times. (Afternoons are better than
mornings.)</TE>
<TE>   * Lodging and packages: Hawaiian hotel rates are amazingly
durable. Despite the post-9/11 trauma that drove down occupancies by
nearly 10%, rooms on average cost only 3% less in the first quarter
of 2002 than last year, according to Toy's company (using statistics
from Smith Travel Research). Oahu took most of the hit; it was down
8.2%. Maui rates were about the same, and Big Island and Kauai rates
actually rose a little.</TE>
<TE>   "Thus far we've been able to avoid deep discounting," Kam says. He
attributes that to demand (despite lower occupancies). Other factors,
experts say: Few hotels have been built in the last decade, and
hoteliers, hoping demand will increase, don't want guests to get used
to lower rates.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of rates, deals may appear in extras such as room
upgrades, a free night or meal credits, travel agent Hannan says.
Aston Hotels &amp; Resorts, which runs more than 30 island lodgings, is
offering a fourth-night-free deal through Dec. 22, subject to
availability. Carlson Wagonlit is offering eight-day land-only
packages through Pleasant Holidays that start at $420 per person,
double occupancy, on Oahu (for the two-diamond AAA-rated Ohana
Waikiki Village, a block from the beach) and $664 on Maui (for the
Maui Eldorado Resort condominiums in Lahaina, also off-beach). They
include a room upgrade, one $50 traveler's check per booking and
hotel transfers (Oahu) or car rental (Maui). Bookings must be made by
June 30 for travel through Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   To keep things in proportion, consider these figures from 2001:
You would generally have paid less to say "aloha" to Honolulu ($223
per person per day) than to San Francisco ($342) or New York ($457),
and you'd pay only a bit less in Orlando, Fla. ($196), according to
Runzheimer International.</TE>

<LD>Geysers, waterfalls, bears, bald eagles, sand dunes, giant
boulders--who needs a theme park when the nation's national parks and
recreation areas have more than enough to entertain and even wow the
kids?</LD>
<LD>   There's probably no cheaper place to take them, especially if you
like to camp out or stay in cozy cabins. The attractions are free,
and $50 buys you an annual pass good for all 385 designated areas in
the national park system. Invite the grandparents: Those 62 and older
get a lifetime pass for $10, entitling them to bring a carload of
relatives with them. (To link to individual parks and see what
programs they offer, or to make reservations through the National
Park Service, visit www.nps.gov.)</LD>
<LD>   My family has been to more than 20 of the best-known national
parks and more than 50 of the others, and we have good memories of
every one.</LD>
<TE>   Everywhere we've been, friendly, knowledgeable rangers offered
tips, whether it was making suggestions for good family hikes or
providing information about hands-on junior ranger programs that,
unlike many hotel programs, were free.</TE>
<TE>   A big bonus: There are plenty of kids everywhere and room for them
to run and jump.</TE>
<TE>   One possible drawback, depending on where you plan to go: More
than half of the national parks' estimated 64 million annual visitors
head to the same 10 parks, laments National Park Service spokesman
Gerry Gaumer.</TE>
<TE>   Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North
Carolina, the most frequently visited, gets more than 10 million
visitors a year. The Grand Canyon gets nearly 4.5 million. There are
numerous traffic jams at Yellowstone, and it can feel like rush hour
along the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible to get away from the crowds; these parks are huge,
after all. But most families don't stick around long enough to try.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be surprised at how many visitors don't even get out of
their cars," Gaumer said. "I wish more people would go to one park
and stay a few days rather than rush from place to place."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps your family would like to stay in one of the grand,
old-fashioned lodges that were built by railway barons at the turn of
the 20th century to encourage train travel. A new PBS series on these
lodges will be broadcast on Wednesdays in July. Visit
www.greatlodges.com, or check out "The Complete Guide to the National
Park Lodges," by David L. Scott, which describes more than 100
lodging facilities in parks (Globe-Pequot Press, $17.95).</TE>
<TE>   Last-minute travelers may have better luck this year getting the
spot they want in a historic lodge, because park visitation is down.
Be flexible and persistent. Many people book far in advance and then
must cancel, officials say. For that reason, room availability is
constantly changing. Visit www.xanterra.com to make reservations at
lodges and cabins in Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Bryce and Zion,
and Death Valley. Contact local visitor bureaus for tips on places to
stay that are just outside the parks.</TE>
<TE>   Better yet, skip the busiest parks. You can fight the crowds at
Grand Teton National Park (2.6 million annual visitors), or you can
see just as much wildlife and just as many pristine mountain lakes at
one of my favorite places, Glacier National Park in Montana (1.7
million visitors). Six years later, my family still talks about that
hike to a glacier. You don't have to go to Yellowstone (2.8 million
annual visitors) to show kids geothermal wonders. You'll find
geysers, bubbling mud, hot springs and steam vents at Lassen Volcanic
National Park in Northern California (372,000 visitors). There's
plenty of hiking, boating and horseback riding at Lassen too.</TE>
<TE>   Skip Mammoth Cave (1.7 million annual visitors) in Kentucky and
head for Carlsbad Caverns (450,000 visitors) in New Mexico. Carlsbad
is known for the underground "Big Room," one of the largest such
chambers in the world; it could fit 14 football fields and an
18-story building inside. Even the most unenthusiastic teenager can't
help but be impressed by the 62-foot-high stalagmite. Watch the
swarms of bats fly out of the Bat Cave at sundown in search of food
(300 bats per second). Oregon's Caves National Monument and South
Dakota's Jewel Cave and Wind Cave are also great bets.</TE>
<TE>   Head to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado
(179,000 annual visitors), where the scenery and wildlife can be just
as spectacular as they are at Rocky Mountain National Park (3.3
million visitors).</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Olympic National Park in Washington state is terrific.
That's why it's one of the nation's busiest, with 3.3 million annual
visitors. But I prefer the solitude and beauty of 26-mile-wide Crater
Lake National Park in Oregon (440,000 visitors) or North Cascades
National Park in Washington (530,000 visitors), which is full of
waterfalls, rivers and wildflowers.</TE>
<TE>   Dinosaur fans will love Dinosaur National Monument (329,000
visitors), which straddles Colorado and Utah and includes a great
dinosaur quarry. If you're looking for long stretches of beach,
consider Assateague National Seashore (1.9 million annual visitors),
which runs along the Virginia and Maryland coasts, rather than Cape
Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina (2.5 million visitors).
Assateague is famous for its wild-horse refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Canoe in Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota, or explore ancient
Anasazi ruins at Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona.
You'll be amazed how happy the kids can be without TV or
computers--most of the time, anyway. Just make sure everyone has
broken in their hiking boots, and that you've stashed plenty of M&amp;Ms
for the trail.</TE>
<TE>   After all, chocolate never fails.</TE>

<LD>The front-page story "German Teen Kills 17, Self in Shooting Spree at
School" (April 27) may induce travelers to avoid Erfurt, Germany.
This would be sad, as the city occupies a special place in our
hearts. My wife and I discovered it two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The tragedy occurred in a 1,000-year-old town that has a
magnificent cathedral, squares and half-timbered buildings. Because
it was behind the postwar Iron Curtain, it was not accessible to
Americans for decades. Miraculously, Erfurt was one of the few towns
of its size in Germany that wasn't virtually leveled in the bombings.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a half-hour away by train, colorful Weimar, Wittenberg
and Eisenach are UNESCO World Cultural Cities. All played major roles
in the life and works of Martin Luther during the Reformation.
Eisenach is also renowned for its fascinating fortress-palace, the
Wartburg, founded in 1067, which has a hotel and restaurant.</LD>

<LD>I have always enjoyed "The Sourcebook" (May 19), but I find it
incomplete. As a travel medicine specialist, I find travelers are not
informed about their need to visit someone for medical information
before their travels. This is particularly important for those who
are going to developing countries or who have ongoing health needs
that can be affected by the type and location of their travel.</LD>
<LD>   The International Society of Travel Medicine, www.istm.org,
maintains a list of those who specialize in this area and are able to
provide consultations and needed vaccines as well as medications
specific to travel.</LD>

to $500 in goods and services, and it cost me only about $5 in

<LD>Regarding Herb Rosenzweig's comments on the Star Princess ("Cruise
Columnists Missed the Boat," Letters, May 12): My wife and I were
passengers on the inaugural cruise from Singapore to Los Angeles in
February and March, and our experience was the opposite of his.</LD>
<LD>   Everything about the ship, waiters, dining room, buffets,
mini-suites, room stewards, lounges and especially the food were
superior to what we expected. I was not a fan of Princess Cruises in
the '70s, but today they deserve credit for a job well done.</LD>
<LD>   I too have taken many cruises--this was my 22nd--and I place
Princess as the best value in the business. We have always praised
Crystal Cruises for the superb job it does, but why pay extra when
Princess gives us what we desire for far less money?</LD>

<HD>An Air of Antiquity in Norwich</HD>
<DH>East Anglia town is near London's bustling energy, but
centuries away in time and pace</DH>

<DL>NORWICH, England</DL>
<LD>I was riding the London Underground when I saw an advertisement for
East Anglia, the hub-shaped area of England northeast of London.</LD>
<LD>   "Can you imagine a place where just breathing in makes you feel
better?" it read. "A place where you're offered all the space, peace
and quiet you could need?"</LD>
<LD>   I hated to be manipulated by an advertisement, but after a few
days in London's August heat last year, I had had it with the crowds,
buses spewing diesel exhaust, rickety and filthy Tube trains and the
armies of tourists. So I set out for a few days' respite in Norwich
(pronounced Nor-itch, with the "w" silent, or sometimes Nor-ridge to
rhyme with "porridge"), the capital of East Anglia, about two hours
northeast of London by train.</LD>
<TE>   On the advice of a friend, I had visited the city a few years ago
and looked forward to going back. It is the kind of place where you
can still find olde England.</TE>
<TE>   Many other medieval provincial English towns have been transformed
by urban development and sprawl, but Norwich has retained much of its
ancient charm. The city center is a maze of narrow cobblestone lanes,
and in places remnants of the original city wall, which dates back
700 years, have been carefully preserved.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 11th century, Norwich was an important Anglo-Saxon
market center; by the 1670s, on the strength of its textile
manufacturing, it had grown into the largest provincial town in
England, second in size and importance only to London. Today Norwich
is a smallish city with a population of 124,000, and it's never more
than a two-mile walk from any point along its perimeter to its
center.</TE>
<TE>   The advertisement I had seen on the Tube must have lured many
others here as well, because it took Ann, the kind woman at the
Norwich tourist office, nearly half an hour to find me lodgings for
four nights. But she came through with a room in Pine Lodge, a
pleasant B&amp;B on the western side of town, near the University of East
Anglia and a half-hour's walk from the city center.</TE>
<TE>   A bus dropped me off across the road from the B&amp;B, and Maxine, my
landlady for the next few days, showed me to a cramped but elegant
room dominated by a canopy bed. For $38 a night, including a proper
English fry-up in the morning, it was a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   The shops and sights were closing by the time I walked back to the
city center, so I happily decided to take advantage of Norwich's
greatest asset--its pubs. Norwich locals claim the city has 365 of
them--one for every day of the year--and it's probably not far from
the truth.</TE>
<TE>   I found my way into Tombland, a well-maintained cobblestone street
that held a Saxon marketplace about 1,000 years ago, and settled into
a table on the patio in front of Boswells, a brasserie-style pub
adjacent to Norwich's breathtaking Norman cathedral. Boswells is
popular with the upscale after-work crowd who congregate here to
savor pints. Although traffic along the street was loud, I relaxed
with a pint of Woodforde's Wherry, a smooth, medium-bodied Norfolk
County brew.</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't eaten anything since a sandwich in London's Liverpool
Street Station, so the Woodforde's put a spring in my step as I
trotted up Magdalen Street in search of a tongue-boiling curry for
dinner. Magdalen Street is home to several good Indian restaurants,
the most luxurious of which is Ali Tandoori. I went instead to
Norwich Tandoori, next to Anglia Square. It's a more modest place,
but I knew from my last visit that it served the best Indian food in
the city. I had onion bhaji (fritters) followed by chicken tikka
Madras and left breathing fire.</TE>
<TE>   I ambled back down Magdalen Street, crossed the creek-like Wensum
River on the tiny Fye Bridge and stopped at Ribs of Beef, a
plain-looking pub popular with students from the University of East
Anglia because of its excellent selection of ales. The Ribs of Beef
serves Rib Cracker ale, which they brew on the premises, and it is
fine indeed--dark, fruity and powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Then I searched out a Norwich landmark--the Adam and Eve, one of
the oldest pubs in England. The first record of the Adam and Eve is
from 1249, when workmen building the nearby cathedral came here in
the evenings and were paid for their labor in bread and ale. Its
ceilings are low, built during a time when people were smaller, and
there are several little rooms in which you can enjoy a pint while
its loquacious landlady, Rita, tells you stories about the pub's
history.</TE>
<TE>   The next day dawned sunny and warm, and as I walked up Earlham
Road into the city, I chanced on a Norwich treasure: the Plantation
Garden, created by Henry Trevor, a 19th century businessman who made
his fortune selling furniture. Set off one of Norwich's busiest
roads, the three-acre Victorian Plantation Garden is enclosed by
verdant beeches, chestnuts and elms and a medieval terrace wall. When
I entered I felt I was in a different, more placid time. With its
unpretentious flower beds, Gothic fountain, rustic bridge and
Italianate terrace that overlooks the garden, it is a refuge from
modernity.</TE>
<TE>   I passed two women on a bench who, like me, were smiling ear to
ear. "It's spectacular, isn't it?" one of them called.</TE>
<TE>   My next stop, Norwich Cathedral, is also spectacular, though in a
different way. Its spire, at 315 feet, is the second highest in
England, surpassed only by the 404-foot spire of Salisbury Cathedral.
The Normans began construction of Norwich Cathedral in 1096, but it
wasn't consecrated until 1278. Most of the town's medieval structures
were built of locally mined dark flint, but the cathedral was
constructed of bright limestone transported from Caen, France. It was
a massive undertaking, and the result was a cathedral that is a
beacon in the heart of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Norwich Cathedral has all the greatness of Westminster Abbey,
without the hordes of tourists. Its air of sanctity is undisturbed. I
spent a couple of hours walking around and savoring the quiet
antiquity, then relaxed beneath the spire on the grass courtyard,
circumscribed by the largest monastic cloisters in England.</TE>
<TE>   The cathedral is the grandest of Norwich's houses of worship, but
not the only one worthy of a visit. The city is packed with small
medieval churches--32 survive of the 56 that existed at the time of
the Reformation. In this more secular age, many of them have been put
to unorthodox uses: an art and cultural center, a sports hall, a
juvenile rehabilitation center.</TE>
<TE>   I visited St. Julian's Church, named after Julian of Norwich, a
hermit who lived there in the 14th century and who wrote "The
Revelations of Divine Love," widely recognized as the first book by a
woman in English, in which she portrayed God as all-loving rather
than all-powerful--a mother as well as a father.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the afternoon it was time to return to more earthly
concerns, so I wandered among the stalls of the lively open-air
market in the city center. There I encountered a bizarre medley of
sights, sounds and smells. There were stalls in which to buy
secondhand books, fresh produce and inexpensive clothing. But one was
devoted to vacuum-cleaner parts; another displayed, among other
meats, a tray of pigs' trotters buzzed by a swarm of flies. I passed
on the trotters, but my stomach was rumbling. I would need food to
fortify myself for a pub crawl that evening.</TE>
<TE>   I went to Tatler's, a fine restaurant with a country ambience that
bills itself as the "home of Norfolk gastronomy." I won't try to
persuade you that fish and chips is the height of dining excellence,
but when they want to, the English really can cook, and Tatler's is
proof. I had deep-fried Cromer crab puffers with charred tomato
relish and curry oil for an appetizer, followed by a ravioli of
salmon, lobster and monkfish served with buttered leeks in a
lobster-tarragon broth.</TE>
<TE>   The next day I set out for Norwich's other major tourist
attraction--the Norman castle, built soon after work began on the
cathedral. Sitting atop a hill in the center of town, it is an
imposing, fortified keep, or at least it was before it was turned
into a jail and, more recently, a museum.</TE>
<TE>   When I visited, the castle had just reopened after a two-year
renovation, and the results are impressive. Inside the keep, video
displays and virtual reality tours guide visitors through castle life
over the ages. Downstairs, I toyed with exhibits--mostly for kids,
but I wasn't about to be left out--that asked me to re-create how
they transported the stone from Caen to Norwich. I took a guided tour
of the battlements and had a spectacular view of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Attached to the castle keep is a small but outstanding museum with
galleries devoted to painting, sculpture and natural history. I was
delighted by a collection of watercolors by John Sell Cotman, one of
the key figures in the Norwich School, a group of 19th century
painters known for lush Norfolk landscapes and nature scenes.</TE>
<TE>   On my last day, my friend Bruce Johnson drove from London to join
me for lunch. We set out for the Broads, an area covered in shallow
lakes and waterways formed in the Middle Ages when peat was dug up
and used for fuel. The wetlands, or broads, span much of Norfolk and
Suffolk counties and contain about 200 miles of waterways. The area,
now a national park, is a favorite destination for bird-watchers.</TE>
<TE>   There was a thick fog when we pulled off a country lane at
Reedham. The object of our expedition, the Reedham Ferry Inn, lay
across a small, nameless broad.</TE>
<TE>   On foot we boarded a ferry, whose source of locomotion was a lawn
mower-style engine that dragged the platform across the water. When
we were halfway across we were enveloped by the mist, and it felt as
if we were crossing into a fairy-tale realm as the Ferry Inn slowly
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Inside it was warm and crowded with people who had come for a
proper Sunday lunch of roast beef, gravy, potatoes and Yorkshire
pudding. The food was wonderful, and we refreshed ourselves with
pints of Old Speckled Hen, a strong but smooth amber beer.</TE>
<TE>   Full and happy, Bruce and I took the ferry back across the broad.
I kept my eyes on the inn as it disappeared into the mist. Bruce
breathed in deeply and said, "It's a breath of fresh air, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: When this door-within-a-door opened at the Royal
Palace in Fes, Morocco, Ventura reader Russell C. Richardson peeked
in and saw nothing but irony. "There are so many doors," Richardson
says, "which is inviting in nature, but you can't go in." He
photographed exteriors of this royal residence and other palaces--all
closed to the public--during a three-week tour a year ago, shooting
this photo as two workers in traditional garb emerged. Richardson,
who teaches political science at College of the Canyons in Santa
Clarita, was drawn to Morocco's Islamic culture and "glorious"
architecture. "There is an air of mystery about the palaces," he
says. "I like this shot because they're trying to look out, and
you're trying to look in."</CP>

<LD>The ticking of a clock can keep me awake all night. So can a plastic
mattress pad, top sheets that are too short, greasy cooking smells, a
leaky faucet. At home, I can control such annoyances. In hotels, I'm
the princess struggling with that pea.</LD>
<LD>   I remember a few sleepless nights on the road as vividly as I
recall the shower scene in Hitchcock's "Psycho," the agony of tossing
and turning and the way my thoughts cycled: "I'm going to sleep now.
I can't sleep. I'll have a horrible day tomorrow."</LD>
<LD>   "I'll sleep when I'm dead," rock musician Warren Zevon once said.
But I need to get to sleep sooner than that to be alert, amiable and
receptive to joy, especially when traveling. Travel insomnia isn't
just a matter of jet lag, a disruption of sleeping and waking
routines caused by crossing multiple time zones. It can hit whenever
people try to sleep in an unfamiliar bedroom, whether it's 30 or
3,000 miles from home.</LD>
<TE>   "When you take people out of the home environment and put them in
another place, sleep is often miserable," says Mark Rosekind, a Bay
Area sleep researcher who directed the Fatigue Countermeasures
program for NASA. Sleep is lighter, people wake more often in the
middle of the night and they take longer to fall asleep, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors, including noise, temperature and light, affect
sleep on the road. Obviously, travel insomniacs need to seek out
quiet hotel rooms that are neither too hot nor too cold, with covered
windows and comfortable beds.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes sleep deterrents aren't apparent until you get into
bed and start counting the passing hours by the banging of elevator
doors, the rumble of ice dispensers, the voices of people in the
hall.</TE>
<TE>   At the landmark Chateau Laurier hotel in Ottawa, Canadian sleep
disorders specialist Meir Kryger once stayed in a handsome room
overlooking the Parliament Hill clock tower. But the clock chimed on
the quarter hour, forcing Kryger to change rooms at 3 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   As people started traveling more in the last decade, some hotels,
like Tokyo's Okura, introduced anti-jet lag programs including
massages, therapy with lights, and special diets formulated to help
induce sleep. In 1996 Hilton introduced 80 "Sleep-Tight Rooms" in
major U.S. cities, equipped with soothing sound machines and light
boxes. Both initiatives have been discontinued because, the companies
said, they wanted to go in a different direction.</TE>
<TE>   I doubt there's a traveler who hasn't had one of those awful
sleepless nights. My worst were in a windowless lower-deck cabin on a
Caribbean cruise, a tent at Zion National Park in Utah and a tiny,
stuffy Madrid hotel room where I battled jet lag for three nights and
almost lost.</TE>
<TE>   I have learned to pack a sleep mask and earplugs, which help
induce sleep in even the most incommodious places. I put these on the
bedside table, together with a glass of water, tissues, my alarm, a
book and sleeping pills.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with taking a medication, especially if you
have something important going on the next day," says Canadian
specialist Kryger. I rarely take them, but just knowing they're there
usually gives me the reassurance I need to fall asleep.</TE>
<TE>   Worry about oversleeping can sometimes keep me awake, so I set my
own travel alarm as a backup in case the one in the room doesn't work
or the hotel forgets my wake-up call. When I wake in the middle of
the night, I try not to look at the clock because it makes matters
worse to find myself wide awake at 4 a.m. Instead I open a
book--usually a travel guide, without a plot to keep me turning the
pages.</TE>
<TE>   Paying attention to details like these that familiarize an
unfamiliar place and recall established bedtime routines is more
important than most travel insomniacs realize, sleep specialist
Rosekind says. He doesn't laugh when he sees teenage travelers with
pillows and stuffed animals from home. "Anything you can do to make a
strange new environment familiar could help you get to sleep," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, doing things differently on the road can keep you
awake. For instance, if you don't watch TV in bed at home, you
shouldn't when traveling, and you certainly shouldn't start a
two-hour movie when it's time to go to sleep. Moreover, Rosekind
warns troubled sleepers to avoid activities with negative
connotations, like watching the often-disturbing late news or trying
to solve a difficult work problem.</TE>
<TE>   Eating wisely also can help travelers avoid sleeplessness.
"Ideally, you should finish dinner three hours before you go to bed,
so you're sleeping, not digesting," says Kimberly Mathai, a
registered dietitian in Seattle. Starches like rice, potatoes and
pasta have a calming effect, as do turkey, bananas, whole-grain
crackers, figs and dates, which contain the amino acid tryptophan.
There's no scientific evidence that hot milk induces sleep, although
chamomile and lemon balm tea can be soothing. "In general, hot drinks
help," Mathai says.</TE>
<TE>   Insomnia sometimes strikes even when the hotel room is comfy, you
have followed your usual bedtime routine and you're wearing your
favorite jammies. Then Rosekind suggests the "30-minute toss-and-turn
rule": If you struggle to get to sleep for more than half an hour,
get out of bed and read a book, meditate, do yoga.</TE>
<TE>   Rosekind has found that people's perceptions of how long it takes
them to get to sleep and how long they have slept are usually way off
the mark. "It's probably not as bad as we think," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Next time I sleep poorly before trying to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro or
touring Angkor Wat, I'll keep that in mind and push on.</TE>

<KH>TORREY PINES</KH>
<HD>Evoking the Past by Design</HD>
<DH>The delight is in the details at a new lodge done in the
Arts and Crafts style, near the fabled golf course and a host of San
Diego-area attractions</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORREY PINES</DL>
<LD>There is no town here, none of the shops, restaurants and museums
that make La Jolla to the south and Del Mar to the north such popular
getaway spots. People come to Torrey Pines for its well-known golf
course and stunning five-mile-long strip of California coast, with
wide flat beaches, bizarrely eroding sea cliffs and gnarled,
photogenic trees. Now another equally compelling attraction has put
this in-between place on the map in bold letters: the 175-room Lodge
at Torrey Pines, built in the Arts and Crafts style of Southern
California architects Charles and Henry Greene.</LD>
<LD>   When San Diego businessman William Evans decided to give Torrey
Pines (which had only a Hilton) a luxury hotel inspired by the
brothers Greene, his wife thought he was possessed. Co-developers
worried that the exquisite refinements of the Greene and Greene
style--the mortise-and-tenon joinery of its mahogany beams, its art
glass lights, its earth-toned palette--would be lost on the public.
And architectural historians whom Evans consulted thought his
re-creation of the Greenes' costly, labor-intensive architecture and
design couldn't amount to more than a gimmick.</LD>
<TE>   Evans proved all of them wrong (except for his wife, he readily
admits). There is nothing gimmicky about this hotel on the edge of
the Torrey Pines Municipal Golf Course, just south of Torrey Pines
State Reserve. It is not a palace of gold plating and marble, though
it's luxurious and pricey (doubles start at $450). The lodge, which
opened two months ago, is all about the fine craftsmanship, attention
to detail, love of wood and accents from the Orient that make such
Greene and Greene works as the Gamble and Blacker houses in Pasadena
so beloved. Edward R. Bosley, director of the Gamble House, now a
Greene and Greene museum, calls the effect "a wonderful combination
of elegance and rusticity."</TE>
<TE>   To understand how seriously Evans pursued his quest for
authenticity, you have only to see the porte-cochere. It is supported
at the center of a circular driveway by a brick-and-cobblestone
stanchion like the one at the Blacker House, a privately owned
residence considered the architects' masterpiece. The glass in the
front door at the lodge was made by Judson Studios of Los Angeles,
one of the firms the Greenes favored, and it is very much like the
front-door glass at the Gamble House, except that a Torrey pine is
used as the motif in its art glass panels instead of an oak.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, you'll find more signature Greene and Greene features:
wide-hooded wood and glass lamps; chandeliers suspended by leather
straps; ebony-pegged chairs, intricately paned windows and copper
fireplace hoods; joints in the wood borrowed from shipbuilding, walls
made of oddly shaped bricks known as "clinker," shady roof overhangs.
Perhaps an expert could detect flaws and inconsistencies and would
find the hotel somewhat too big for its site. But to someone like me
who knows the Greenes' work chiefly from the Gamble and Blacker
houses, the lodge is breathtaking in its thoroughness and
faithfulness to the Greene and Greene designs.</TE>
<TE>   Evans says he knew he was in the presence of greatness when he
first saw the Gamble House about six years ago. The Greenes helped
bring the handmade, nature-inspired precepts of the Arts and Crafts
movement to America during the peaking of the machine age in the
early 20th century. To Evans, their work symbolizes "what California
was before beach culture and Hollywood, the mythical land where you
could open a window and pluck an orange off a tree."</TE>
<TE>   I walked through the hotel with Evans, but only after staying here
for two nights in early May without telling the management I was from
The Times, because I wanted to get my own impressions of the place
and find out how the average guest is treated. Immediately upon
arrival, the wide smiles of the kilted Scottish doorman, valet
parking attendants and receptionists suggested they knew I was a
travel writer, as did the lecture on Greene and Greene I got from the
bellboy who took me to my fourth-floor room.</TE>
<TE>   The room had a fireplace, a king-size bed in the style of Arts and
Crafts furniture maker Gustav Stickley and a wall of windows directly
overlooking the golf course. I had booked a less expensive room with
a courtyard view. But this was clearly an upgrade. That iced it. They
were onto me.</TE>
<TE>   Later I challenged Evans to deny it. "We thought you were Susie
Spanos, the wife of the owner of the San Diego Chargers," he said.
With rumors flying that the football franchise plans to move to Los
Angeles, treating her like royalty made sense to Evans. (As for the
Greene and Greene lecture, it turns out that Evans has staff members
tour the Gamble House museum so they'll know a bit about the story of
Arts and Crafts.) I benefited from the mistaken identity, but as a
result I can't say for sure just how good the service is at the
lodge.</TE>
<TE>   It seems as well-oiled as the Honduran mahogany and Brazilian
cherry wood lining the hallways. I lost my key card and valet parking
ticket: "No problem, Ms. Spanos." A room service breakfast of coffee,
fresh-squeezed orange juice and yogurt with berries arrived at my
door 15 minutes after I ordered it, accompanied by a little vase of
fresh flowers. After dinner at A.R. Valentien, the hotel's handsome
restaurant named for the San Diego painter who was a contemporary of
the Greenes, I asked the waiter to save the split of 1998 Chalk Hill
California Chardonnay I couldn't finish: "But of course, Ms. Spanos."</TE>
<TE>   More than the service, I loved the details. The hot tub, beyond
the pool, is set in a wood deck and shaded by those rare Torrey
pines. It is so close to the first hole of the south course that you
can check out the golfers' form while you're lazing in the water. The
pressed paper coasters in the beautiful little bar are prints of
botanical paintings by artist Valentien; the originals are in the
restaurant next door. Public hallways are lined with more art,
including a fascinating series of covers from the early 20th century
German Art Nouveau magazine "Jugend," which Evans says he found at an
antique show and bought for $1.50 each. The Spa at Torrey Pines,
where I had a massage, abandons Greene and Greene for the Scottish
Art Nouveau of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The Arts and Crafts
movement and Art Nouveau were closely allied, but Mackintosh is as
different from the Greenes as a lily is from a pine cone, so the spa
seems a bit of a jolt.</TE>
<TE>   After the massage, I dined lavishly at A.R. Valentien, which has
beautiful brown banquettes and booths and the air of a private club.
(In about two months it will be joined by a less formal grill in the
wing closest to the golf course clubhouse.) The chef is Jeff Jackson,
formerly of Santa Monica's Shutters on the Beach. My meal--braised
radicchio and prosciutto, scallops on a bed of pesto risotto and
flourless chocolate cake--was good, the service polished. Actually,
though, I liked lunch there the next day better; it seemed more
relaxed, and the chicken leg and root vegetables in mole poblano was
marvelous.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, a great hotel ought to have great guest rooms. Mine had
all the obvious luxe touches--spaciousness, a nonpareil view of the
golf course from the balcony, a marble double sink and inviting
toiletries in the bath (Randell International, a Carlsbad company,
makes the shampoo, conditioner, lotion and shower gel in sage,
lemongrass and rosemary scents that evoke the Southern California
landscape), lots of places to sit with good lighting and easy laptop
computer hookup. The room also had a brocade bedspread and gold and
green textured carpeting in patterns inspired by English Arts and
Crafts designer William Morris. All of the furniture was
Stickley-inspired, solidly made of wood, with leather cushions on the
settee and easy chair. The doors had latches, not knobs. The walls
were cream and olive green, outlined in dark brown beams, decorated
with a Hiroshige print and two California Impressionist landscapes.
Alas, the gas fireplace, surrounded by green tile, had a noxious
smell.</TE>
<TE>   Evans says the only design compromises he made in the lodge were
the modernization of the old Greene and Greene bathrooms and the
raising of guest room ceilings to bring in light. The single
convincing criticism I've ever heard against the Greenes is that the
interiors of their buildings tend to be dark. Despite Evans' effort,
my room was a little tenebrous. But once in a while, after a day at
the beach, darkness has allure. Though the weather was moody and the
skies mostly overcast while I was here, I spent my days exploring. I
drove north through the Sorrento Valley just south of Del Mar, where
North Torrey Pines Road dips through Los Penasquitos marsh, close to
the beach. At the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club (which was founded by
Bing Crosby and cronies in 1937), I checked out the handsome Spanish
Mission-style clubhouse and bandstand. Racing starts this year July
24 and ends Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In La Jolla I studied the big, geometrical Sol LeWitts at the
waterside Museum of Contemporary Art, browsed through John Cole's
Book Shop in a 1904 cottage on Prospect Street and toured the Birch
Aquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (though I was too
early for the new "Secrets of the Seahorse" exhibit, which opened May
11).</TE>
<TE>   Just as interesting to me was realizing that there's more to the
in-between area of Torrey Pines than is readily apparent, like the
cliffhanging Salk Institute on North Torrey Pines Road, founded in
1960 by Jonas Salk of polio vaccine fame. The institute is made of
two banks of concrete buildings, designed by Louis Kahn, with
teak-paneled windows and a breathtaking courtyard in the middle. The
biomedical researchers inside need peace and quiet, so taking an
architectural tour of the exterior, available by appointment on
weekdays, is the only way to see this modernistic masterpiece. I
don't play golf, but I did take two long walks in 2,000-acre Torrey
Pines State Reserve, one a marvelous three-mile circuit from the
beach to the uplands and back down again, the other with a docent. He
explained that many of the rare spindly trees, which the reserve was
founded to protect, grow naturally only here and on Santa Rosa
Island, 25 miles southwest of Santa Barbara. Stopping often to
inspect plants at home on the reserve's stark gullies and hills, we
went only as far as Razor Point, an aerie at the lip of a sandstone
cliff about half a mile from the visitor center. There the Pacific
stretched away west, apparently boundless, beachcombers below looked
the size of cockles and mussels and paragliders hovered in the sky
above our heads, as if eavesdropping on our conversation. The
paragliders and hang gliders take off from Torrey Pines Glider Port
at the far end of a dirt parking lot a few miles south of the lodge.
It has a funky, jury-rigged air, a shop where the brave sign up for
paragliding or hang-gliding lessons and a cafe where the timid can
watch.</TE>
<TE>   North Torrey Pines Road, which runs in front of the glider port
and lodge, is lined with biotech companies and the sprawling campus
of the University of California at San Diego, home to La Jolla
Playhouse performances from May to November. At stoplights a stream
of students crossed the road, carrying surfboards down to the beach,
which gave me the idea of taking a free 90-minute campus tour. On it
I learned that UCSD was a hotbed of activism in the late '60s. The
spirit of Angela Davis, who got a doctorate there in 1969, lingers at
the Che Cafe, where oversized portraits of student radicals decorate
the walls. Futuristic Geisel Library, at the center of the campus, is
named for the beloved children's book author Theodor "Dr. Seuss"
Geisel, who lived in the area.</TE>
<TE>   I was thinking about the way an elephant saves a whole race of
minuscule creatures on a pink flower in my favorite Dr. Seuss book,
"Horton Hears a Who," when I got back to the lodge after the campus
tour. People were wandering in just to see the place and have a
drink, a good way to enjoy the lodge without paying for a room.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Horton, architecture will never save the world. But when
it's done right, it can make us more sensitive and content by
surrounding us with beauty, which surely must be what Greene and
Greene intended. They designed residences, not hotels, that a favored
few get to live in. Now, for everybody else with the money to spend,
there's the Lodge at Torrey Pines.</TE>

<HD>A Novel Relationship</HD>
<DH>F. Scott Fitzgerald helps young Frances Kroll Ring learn
what it means to be a writer in the film 'Last Call.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last two years of F. Scott Fitzgerald's troubled life, as he
toiled on his novel, "The Last Tycoon," Frances Kroll Ring was at his
side, working as his secretary. Fitzgerald never finished the
scathing, brilliant look at Hollywood because he died of a heart
attack at the age of 44 on Dec. 21, 1940. (It was published
posthumously, unfinished.) At the time of his death, Fitzgerald was
an all-but-forgotten literary figure.</LD>
<LD>   Ring's life-changing experience with the author of such classics
as "The Great Gatsby" and "Tender Is the Night" is now the subject of
the Showtime movie "Last Call," premiering Saturday. It's based on
her 1985 book, "Against the Current: As I Remember F. Scott
Fitzgerald."</LD>
<LD>   Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons (for 1990's "Reversal of
Fortune"), who has played such tortured characters as Charles Ryder
in "Brideshead Revisited" and Humbert Humbert in the remake of
"Lolita," stars as Fitzgerald, a man fighting the demons of alcohol
while trying to make enough money to keep his mentally unbalanced
wife Zelda (Sissy Spacek) institutionalized and their daughter
Scottie at Vassar.</LD>
<TE>   Neve Campbell plays Ring, then a 23-year-old aspiring writer who
was sent by her employment agency one day in 1939 to work for
Fitzgerald. Though an avid reader, Ring had never experienced
Fitzgerald.</TE>
<TE>   "I had read Hemingway," Ring recalls today with a laugh. "It was
the Depression, and Fitzgerald was a romantic writer. Economically,
the country was in a bad state and we were not reading about romance,
really. As you get older, you realize he wasn't really just a
romantic writer. He wrote of the times. I started to read him very
quickly and then saw his own talent unfold as he was writing and
learned a lot about what it takes to be a writer. It ain't easy."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald showed her "the enormous energy and effort and standard
of perfection that he had for language and for ideas. That was what
was really very impressive. Nothing was ever finished with him. He
would do it and would do it over and over until it read like a poem.
He was essentially a writer, but life took hold and pyramided him up
into an excitement and stature he wasn't really prepared for."</TE>
<TE>   Ring, who has a cameo as herself in the movie's last scene, wrote
her book to set the record straight about her former boss. "Everybody
said he died in defeat, and he died drunk," said Ring, a successful
writer herself. "He didn't. He died working like the devil and got a
heart attack, which was inevitable for him from his previous life
because he smoked a lot, though he tapered off the drinking toward
the end."</TE>
<TE>   Irons had never picked up a Fitzgerald novel until he was asked to
do the film. "I am not that well read," said the British actor. "I
had never had a reason. So I was interested when they asked me to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   The actor gained most of his insight into Fitzgerald from Ring's
book. "This is very much Frances Kroll Ring's Fitzgerald," he said.
"She met a very particular man who is not functioning well, having a
very destructive relationship with Zelda."</TE>
<TE>   Irons sees Fitzgerald as a man who needed to be famous and wasn't.
"It seems to be the Irishness in him always believed that success and
money would bring happiness," he said. "They didn't. Then his time
sort of passed. America changed and no longer did his work have
resonance. He was living in Hollywood, which is not the best place to
live if you are an unsuccessful writer. I think his time with Frances
was a little resurgence. He knew he had another book in him. He
wanted to write it because he wanted to once again be Scott
Fitzgerald, writer of note."</TE>
<TE>   "Last Call," written and directed by Henry Bromell, was an
educational experience for Campbell because it introduced her to the
works of Fitzgerald. "When this came around, I read 'The Great
Gatsby' and 'The Last Tycoon'--unbelievable," she proclaims. "I
started the 'Great Gatsby' and read it in one night. That was fun for
me because that was the experience within the film for Frances. She
went through the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell believes Ring and Fitzgerald both needed each other at
that time. "She did become a confidant and they ended up having this
great friendship," said the actress. "I think for Frances, it was to
meet a person who lived in a world that was so foreign to her and
inspired her. It was just awesome for her. I think for him to have
someone who was a constant in his life, was there every day and who
he could have as a confidant...."</TE>
<TE>   The actress said she was a bit intimidated about playing Ring
until she met her. "She is just such a lovely, wonderful, caring
human being," Campbell said. "When I first met her, I was nervous,
and by the end of the meeting, while we were talking, she put her
hand on my knee and said, 'You'll do me fine.' It was so adorable."</TE>
<TE>   "Last Call" can be seen Saturday at 8 p.m. on Showtime. The
network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under the
age of 14).</TE>

<HD>Burned-Out New Mexico Town 'On Its Way Back'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH BAKER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LOS ALAMOS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Two years after a government-set wildfire roared out of Los Alamos
Canyon and into the town, the banging of hammers and the hum of heavy
equipment fills the air.</LD>
<LD>   Houses are springing up from the mud, the construction starkly new
against a backdrop of blackened mountainsides.</LD>
<LD>   "Los Alamos is on its way back," Federal Emergency Management
Agency chief Joe Allbaugh said during a recent visit.</LD>
<TE>   More than 350 families lost their homes when the Cerro Grande
Fire--named for the peak where the National Park Service began
burning brush on May 4, 2000--blew out of the pine forest like a
blowtorch.</TE>
<TE>   About 18,000 residents of Los Alamos and nearby White Rock were
forced to flee. The fire burned for two months over 43,000 acres,
including parts of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, birthplace of
the atomic bomb. But it took no lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just so grateful the kids were OK, the animals were OK,"
recalled Melanie Kossar, mother of two, whose home was destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Because the fire was the federal government's fault, FEMA has
replaced homes and possessions, repaired damage to houses and
property, repaid people for their evacuation costs and their loss of
income, and reimbursed businesses for the weeks they were closed.</TE>
<TE>   FEMA also is helping Los Alamos become more fireproof. New houses
sport metal roofs, stucco siding, steel doors and tempered glass, at
government expense.</TE>
<TE>   Even the new landscaping will be "fire wise." No more huge
combustible ponderosa pines overhanging roofs; instead, swaths of
low-growing, fire-resistant shrubs or plants, and noncombustible rock
and mulches, will surround new homes.</TE>
<TE>   Community fireproofing efforts--tree-thinning, for example--will
be paid for by FEMA in Los Alamos and neighboring areas.</TE>
<TE>   The projected price tag for the claims and prevention efforts:
$535million.</TE>
<TE>   The disaster agency's usual role is providing temporary
assistance, helping victims get back on their feet with grants or
low-interest loans.</TE>
<TE>   Only once before has the federal government compensated victims
for all their losses, FEMA said. That was in 1976, after the Bureau
of Reclamation's Teton Dam in Idaho gave way, killing 11 and
destroying 130 homes in the little farm town below.</TE>
<TE>   Kossar, underinsured and newly divorced at the time of the fire,
said that without government help she would have been in serious
trouble after the multifamily house she lived in burned to the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, she has been living with her 18-year-old
son and 16-year-old daughter in a FEMA trailer.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes to return by the end of this month to her former
neighborhood, but to a house of her own. The wooden unit called a
"quad," built decades ago by the government for laboratory workers,
is being replaced by three single-family homes.</TE>
<TE>   In the mobile home in "FEMAville"--the temporary trailer park that
initially housed 85 families and is down to 18--"there's no way to
get away from each other. Here, the kids can have their own rooms,"
Kossar said, showing off the small two-story home.</TE>
<TE>   And she'll have the same next-door neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We liked the neighborhood and we wanted to come back," said
Charlene McHale, who bought into the quad only six months before the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   McHale, the mother of two grown children, also was newly divorced
when she moved to the quad, an experience she says made her and
Kossar more resilient.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of knew the process to get on with it. You just try to
put one foot in front of the other and keep going," McHale said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government also is providing Los Alamos County with
$30million for other mitigation measures, including burying utilities
in burned neighborhoods, thinning trees and removing dead wood on
county-owned land, and helping homeowners who weren't burned out to
make their places more fire resistant.</TE>
<TE>   "The fence line that separates the public land from the private
land doesn't stop a fire," said Bruce Irwin, the county's mitigation
projects coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamos, located atop a 7,300-foot mesa in the Jemez Mountains,
abuts a ponderosa pine forest.</TE>
<TE>   "There are hundreds of mountain communities around the U.S. that
have the same problem," Irwin said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamos homeowners, beginning with those in high-risk areas on
the forest-fringed perimeter of town, will be able to for
reimbursement of as much as $2,500 for creating "defensible space"
around their homes, Irwin said.</TE>

<HD>A Cinderella Prom for 2 Troubled Girls</HD>
<DH>Society: Group home residents did chores, didn't misbehave
to earn chance to dance the night away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGIE WAGNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HENDERSON, Nev.</DL>
<LD>The lavender skirt and shimmery top have been laid out for hours. Her
nails freshly painted, the teenager walks by her room again just to
look one more time.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never been to a dance," she says, glancing at her prom
outfit.</LD>
<LD>   Soon someone will come to do her makeup and put up her hair. And
later, Tiffany and her friend Crystal will go to their senior
prom--something they never thought they would get to do.</LD>
<TE>   The girls, both 17, live in a group home where almost every
activity from eating to sleeping is scheduled for them. Visits with
friends or after-school activities are monitored and planned. The 13
girls placed at Regina Hall have exhausted the foster care system and
have severe behavioral problems because of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   They ended up here when they ran out of options.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany has been in state custody since she was 2. Her father
died, and she met her mother just once. She still celebrates the day
she was adopted--even though she was removed from the family after
officials found evidence that she was being abused.</TE>
<TE>   In a children's home, Tiffany learned she had a sister. But that
sister died of diabetes last year at 20, and Tiffany keeps an urn of
her ashes on her dresser.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a lifetime of hardship, she is much like any other
teenager. She likes to dance, listens to hip-hop music and hopes to
go to college. And she really wants to go to her prom.</TE>
<TE>   Regina Hall's auxiliary board raised money to buy dresses for
Tiffany and Crystal. They earned the chance to go by staying out of
trouble in the weeks before the prom; they completed all their
chores, didn't skip school and didn't run away.</TE>
<TE>   Because of neglect, the girls lack maturity and may struggle to
make good decisions. Some turned to drugs or lived on the streets.
They were taken from their parents or never even knew them. Foster
homes didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   "These girls come from really tough circumstances," says Barbara
Marz, board president for Regina Hall, which is run by Catholic
Charities of Southern Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   The prom is doubly special for them. "Our goal," Marz says, "was
to provide that normal experience that most teenage girls want to
do--just to kind of feel like a little princess for a day."</TE>
<TE>   The girls have waited weeks for this Saturday night. After the
dance at the Henderson Convention Center, they are allowed to go to
dinner with friends, but must be back in the home by 11p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I get to be a normal teenager," Tiffany says. "I'm more nervous
than excited. I didn't get asked to go, but I'm going."</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany is a senior at Basic High School, which is hosting the
prom. Her friend Crystal, who dropped out of school, is working to
get her high school equivalency certificate.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal and brushes on taupe-colored eye shadow. "My last dance
was eighth grade," she says.</TE>
<TE>   That was before she ran away from an uncle's house, where she had
been living since her mother died when Crystal was 11. She never knew
her father. She became a ward of the state two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I could have done stuff different," she says. "Some of
it's my fault."</TE>
<TE>   But tonight she will try to forget all that.</TE>
<TE>   "To just feel normal, to meet people, to have fun, to get away
from the house," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In Tiffany's room, Geri Smith, a member of the auxiliary board,
arrives to style the teen's hair. She brushes the long, brown hair up
into a ponytail, then makes sections of big curls. Smith helps with
makeup too.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I look so cute!" Tiffany says, admiring herself in a mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Several other girls peer in at their housemate, and Tawana, 17,
hurries to write a poem about the night.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most special day of their lives that they'll never
forget," she writes. "To be able to tell their young ones about their
very first prom day."</TE>
<TE>   Crystal finishes her makeup, and Smith helps with her hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to be a model," Crystal tells Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Then, she shuts her bedroom door and, a few minutes later, makes
her debut.</TE>
<TE>   "She's coming out!" one girl screams as the group gathers around
Crystal's door.</TE>
<TE>   She twirls around, and her friends tell her how beautiful she
looks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny seeing me like this," Tiffany says, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal worries that her tummy sticks out in her slinky dress.</TE>
<TE>   "Suck in your gut; don't eat too much and you should be all
right," offers employee Shandya Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal and Tiffany pose for pictures, then beg shift supervisor
Muriel Zachary not to take them to the dance in the van with a
charity logo painted on the side.</TE>
<TE>   Zachary agrees to use an unmarked van, and the girls go outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody better be awake at 11!" Crystal yells over her
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   They arrive at the prom and soon blend into the crowd of teenagers
in tuxedos and fancy gowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I get to be Cinderella for a day," Tiffany says, heading toward
the dance floor.</TE>

<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba</DL>
<LD>Most cigars sold here are Jamaican. Spanish is rarely spoken. Small
U.S. flags adorn the antennas of Chevrolet pickups. The music blaring
has a distinctly American beat.</LD>
<LD>   The Guantanamo Bay naval base is part of Cuba only geographically
speaking. Enclosed in 17 miles of fence guarded by U.S. Marines, it
is firmly isolated from the land beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Few people come or go under the sign that declares in Spanish,
"Republic of Cuba: Free Territory of America," and coils of rusted
concertina wire remain as a reminder of political differences that
have divided two nations for more than four decades.</LD>
<TE>   Few traces of Cuba remain on the base except for about 70 Cubans
who live here--a mix of longtime residents, their descendants, and
asylum-seekers who swam or crossed minefields to reach the U.S.
outpost.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know each other," said Gloria Martinez, a 69-year-old
widow who has lived on the base since 1961, when she and her husband
sought refuge after the triumph of Fidel Castro's communist
revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez has become a U.S. citizen and speaks English, but she
prefers Spanish and enjoys cooking Cuban dishes of pork, black beans
and rice for friends. "Here, I have a big family," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But for nearly all the 4,700 military personnel and civilians
here, free time means paintball tournaments, yoga classes and dancing
to hip-hop tunes at the recreation hall.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like I'm just in another place in America," said Lance
Cpl. Joshua Devore, a 21-year-old Marine from Rochester, N.Y., who
helps guard prisoners accused of having links to Afghanistan's fallen
Taliban regime or the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   The base has no stoplights, and some say it feels like a small
American town of the 1950s. The weekly newsletter announces a
military spouse apron sale and each day's school lunch, from fish
sticks to fruit gelatin.</TE>
<TE>   The base closed its gates to Cuba in 1961 after the failed
CIA-backed invasion by anti-Castro Cubans at the Bay of Pigs. The
only people allowed through nowadays are 10 elderly Cuban workers who
arrive at the gates by bus each morning--the last among thousands who
once commuted to jobs here. The youngest among them is 62.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the base is an island within an island, a sort of
modern-day Alcatraz, which like the now-closed prison off San
Francisco has become useful because of its isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld called it "the least worst
place we could have selected" for the captives from the Afghanistan
war.</TE>
<TE>   Radios on the base pick up Cuba's Radio Reloj on the AM dial, and
at night the lights of the nearby towns Caimanera and Boqueron cast
their glow from below the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. trade embargo prevents buying Cuban cigars or
anything else from the other side. It's also impossible to telephone
Cuba directly.</TE>
<TE>   Normal channels of communication were cut long ago. U.S. troops
seized the land in 1898 during the Spanish-American War, and since a
1903 agreement, the United States has leased it from Cuba for 2,000
gold coins a year, now valued at $4,085.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government still pays, but Castro's government opposes
the U.S. presence and refuses to cash the checks. Since 1964, when
Cuba cut the water supply, the base has drawn its water from a
desalination plant.</TE>
<TE>   With the end of the Cold War, tensions have eased. Along the
fence, Marines in guard towers watch Cuban guards in distant lookout
posts. Now and then, a thump from the explosion of an old Cuban
landmine breaks the silence, set off by a passing animal or perhaps
just age.</TE>
<TE>   Cubans from the nearby city of Guantanamo still occasionally swim
across the bay or hike to the base in hopes of taking refuge. But the
number of asylum-seekers has waned, and now most are sent back as
required by a 1995 migration agreement.</TE>
<TE>   A small number who can prove a fear of political persecution are
allowed to stay until U.S. officials find other countries to accept
them. Those 25 Cubans live in separate barracks, and some have
remained for years.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, the base held tens of thousands of Cuban and
Haitian boat people picked up by U.S. ships as they tried to get to
the U.S. mainland. Most of the Cubans were admitted into the United
States; most Haitians were sent home. The last of the Cubans departed
in 1996, leaving empty camps on the dry, cactus-dotted hills.</TE>
<TE>   Near a seaside cliff, one Cuban artist left a sculpture of a
woman, her gaze fixed in the distance--a silent reminder that this
place too is part of Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Once a month, U.S. and Cuban officers meet at the gates to discuss
security issues. Relations between their governments, though, remain
cool.</TE>
<TE>   "Someday maybe they'll open up the gates and let us down in
Guantanamo City," said Army 2nd Lt. Jason Miller of Bettendorf, Iowa.
"But not until the United States and Cuba mend fences."</TE>

<LD>I always get a chuckle when I see an "update" article on the Los
Angeles riots ("Searching for a Legacy," by Peter H. King, April 21).
Inevitably, a community "activist" denies that a riot occurred. It was,
instead, a "moral uprising." Tell me, what was moral about Reginald
Denny's beating? Did I miss some lesson when gun shops, liquor stores and
hardware stores were looted down to the bare floor? If a lack of
education prompted the "uprising," is that why so many schools were
broken into--so the rioters could rush into an empty classroom and start
studying?</LD>
<LD>   It was a riot, dear friends. A looting, burning, violent orgy of
destruction and theft. To characterize it as anything else is, at best,
irresponsible. At worst, it is an equally criminal act of denial and
blame.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to James Ricci for his April 28 column ("For Mountain Lions,
a Life and Death Study," Metropolis). I think about the peril that
mountain lions face every day while living in overdeveloped and
overpopulated places such as Orange County. I can't believe the monstrous
growth I've witnessed there during the past 13 years. When will Southern
Californians wake up? I'm so sick of hearing about homeowners who fear
mountain lions in their backyards. It's the developers' fault for
building there and people's fault for buying their homes. The mountain
lions were there first! Those areas are their habitats, not ours!</LD>
<LD>   I have one beef with one of research scientist Ken Logan's quotes: "It
all boils down to whether we want to coexist with them. I think we can if
we follow some simple rules, like keeping our domestic animals in
predator-proof enclosures at night." Well, here's an easier solution:
Keep the animals in the house at night where they belong!</LD>

<HD>A Gift That Keeps on Giving</HD>
<DH>A Spectacular Cactus Collection Moves to Lotusland</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN HEROLD</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Nagelmann is slowly circling around a large planter box that,
because it is filled with dozens of cacti, resembles a giant pincushion.
Nagelmann, who is normally unflappable, is looking a bit alarmed. "This
is going to be complicated," he says, as if the breadth of the project he
has agreed to undertake is finally sinking in.</LD>
<LD>   What one of the hottest landscape designers in Southern California
will be doing is artfully arranging a massive cactus collection in its
new acre-and-a-half home  at Lotusland, a massive Montecito estate
devoted to plants. Nagelmann is donating his services, a boon that frees
Lotusland to focus on raising the funds--Nagelmann guesstimates it may be
as much as $500,000--needed to properly set up the garden. The estate of
the late Ganna Walska has spent roughly $115,000 to transport the prickly
gift from its former residence in Fallbrook and then keep the cacti
healthy until their final planting. But no one is begrudging a cent.
Collections like this, Lotusland curators agree, come along once in a
lifetime.</LD>
<TE>   It took that long for 95-year-old Merritt Dunlap to amass this
striking array of 300 New World species. Dunlap's thing for cacti was one
of those first-sight affairs. One Sunday night in 1927, the USC senior
drove to the Coachella Valley, and his heart was lost forever. During the
Depression, Dunlap worked as a surveyor and engineer for the Metropolitan
Water District, spending two years living in tents in the desert. For a
cactus lover, it was heaven. By the collection's heyday in the 1970s,
when he moved it from Glendale to his current San Diego County home in
Fallbrook, he had 1,000 plants, including the rare Galapagos opuntia,
which he grew in the early '60s from seeds from the Charles Darwin
Research Station.</TE>
<TE>   What's amazing, says Lotusland horticultural consultant Paul Mills,
who is in charge of maintaining the collection, is that Dunlap managed to
trick the now-impossible-to-get opuntia into taking root. In their native
habitat, the seeds won't sprout without passing through the digestive
system of the Galapagos Islands' giant tortoises. "He put them in a tea
bag that he suspended from a faucet so that the water could drip on
them," leaching the plant's inhibitors in a way that soaking did not,
Mills explains.</TE>
<TE>   Although heavily armored, cacti are easy to injure. The Herculean task
of moving the plants fell to Mills and a Lotusland staffer, Esau Ramirez.
The bulk of the collection arrived at Lotusland late last year, and Mills
chuckles at the memory of the enormous, cactus-laden flatbed trucks
giving freeway motorists yet one more only-in-L.A. memory. Nagelmann is
also grinning. He has just rattled off a plant name only to be corrected
by Lotusland Foundation curator Virginia Hayes. That was the old name,
she explains, bantering with him over how DNA testing and other advances
in plant classification are making it harder for everyone to keep track.
And this very collection, with its range of subspecies and advanced age
of the plants, makes it a potential research bonanza.</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap met Lotusland owner Walska in 1941, when he was stationed as an
Army engineer in Santa Barbara. "Madame," as she was affectionately
known, and "Sigs," short for Sigsbee, his mother's maiden name, bonded
over their mutual love of plants, and three decades later he bequeathed
the collection to his old friend.</TE>
<TE>   Nagelmann and Hayes are now at the newly restored topiary garden next
to a field filled with wild grasses and a couple of ceanothuses--the
cacti's final destination. There's a look in Nagelmann's eyes that says
big plans. There will be the predictable concerns, which plants can go in
the sunnier spots and which might need relief from full sun. But there's
an aesthetic issue too: "What looks good next to what." You could say
these plants will soon be ready for their close-up. Just don't get too
close.</TE>

<LD>Land-lovers have grown crops for 25 years at Ocean View Farms,  a
community garden on a seven-acre hill in Mar Vista overlooking the Santa
Monica Airport. Owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
and managed by the Department of Recreation and Parks, the colorful quilt
of organic flora--and some pesky  fauna--claims 500 plots, 300 active
members and a waiting list of 100. We asked some urban farmers why they
dig it.</LD>

<LD>Where's Claude Monet when we need him? It's a shame the
Impressionist master isn't around to immortalize the garden at the Norton
Simon Museum. No, not the waterlilies--been there, done that--but the guy
afloat on the boat. You could call it "Man in a Plastic Dinghy." When the
museum is closed each Tuesday, Mariposa Horticultural Enterprises of
Irwindale dispatches a crew to keep the 2 1/2-year-old pond shipshape. In
a scene never observed by the public (until now), a member of the
maintenance team boards the museum's inflatable raft and paddles off to
work. "The guys use the boat to fertilize the waterlilies by dropping
little pellets into the underwater planters," says John Sudolcan, the
museum's director of operations. "It also helps when they rake the bottom
to thin the natural growth of the oxygenating grass."</LD>
<LD>   The pond, laid out by Santa Monica landscape designer Nancy Goslee
Power and inspired by Monet's water garden in Giverny, France, is shallow
enough at its edges for workers to don waders for most chores, including
the removal of voracious apple snails and stray goldfish. But for
cleaning the biofilter at the pond's 6-foot-deep center, access is by
rowboat only.</LD>
<TE>   The placid waters in Pasadena may pale in comparison to Monet's
wind-tossed Honfleur seascapes, but the museum is already on its second
raft. The first, a four-man model from Sport Chalet, had to be
decommissioned after two years. "We used to keep it inflated in the
outdoor pump room," Sudolcan says. "But with all the sharp objects out
there, it kept getting punctured and we just couldn't patch it anymore."
The replacement, a smaller gray-vinyl number from Big 5 Sporting Goods,
should remain seaworthy a long time. Says Brian Regan, Sudolcan's
assistant: "We deflate it after every use, fold it up, pack it in its box
and store it inside in the art shop. We treat that one like it's gold."</TE>

<LD>Ah, the fertile byways of higher education--ethnomusicology,
Romance languages and, of course, composting. The eight-week Master
Composter course offered by Encinitas-based Solana Recyclers gives
matriculants comprehensive instruction in the alchemical process of
recycling yard clippings, food scraps and so on into "gardener's gold."
"If you just want to know how to compost, you can pick it up in an hour,"
says Tammy Tatum, program coordinator and instructor. "But we go over 30
hours of material."</LD>
<LD>   The curriculum covers such nuances as soil chemistry,
nitrogen-to-carbon ratio, waste-management issues and vermicomposting
techniques, as well as public speaking and presentation skills. Like any
rigorous college course, the instruction culminates in a final exam,
which leads to a "Master Composter" certificate from Solana. Master
Composters can give workshops and lecture at community organizations
about the prized decomposing piles. "People come to the class looking for
an answer to the elusive question, 'How can I get beautiful compost in as
little time as possible?' " says Tatum, who completed the course in 1995.
"By the time we finish, they'll have the tools to do that, but they'll
also be able to answer questions about the environment."</LD>
<TE>   San Diego County started the course in 1994 and Solana Recyclers, a
nonprofit organization focusing on environmental education, took it over
a year later. Nearly 180 students from across Southern California have
graduated to certified status. (Riverside County offers a similar class
limited to residents of that county.) The program is usually held once a
year, in the spring or fall, and is free but for a $25 materials fee. In
return, enrollees must complete 30 hours of compost-related community
service. "When we're reviewing applications, we look for people who like
to volunteer and get involved with their neighborhoods," Tatum says. "Our
goal is to get as many people as possible educated about composting."</TE>
<TE>   To the true scholar, of course, the quest for knowledge--and the
perfect compost recipe--is never-ending. For the record, Tatum suggests
amassing at least 27 cubic feet of half "browns" (leaves, straw, shredded
newspaper) and half "greens" (grass clippings, food scraps) all at once,
and then turning the hot pile whenever it starts cooling, for a lovely
compost in just three weeks.</TE>

<HD>Life Outside the Box</HD>
<DH>Southern Californians have  a relationship with the  great outdoors
that is best  described as active. A  benign climate lets us work, eat
and even sleep in some nontraditional spaces. In  the pages that follow,
you'll discover how a yard--or even a tiny space--can  become a
sanctuary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was a child, I had fantasies of living permanently outside,
in a Girl Scout tent or maybe a crude hut made with leftover wood from
one of my dad's building projects. I'd live off whatever food I could
find, cooking it over a campfire. At night, I'd unroll my Girl Scout
sleeping bag.</LD>
<LD>   It was a dream of self-sufficiency that, like many children's dreams,
ignored realities--like loneliness, school, my parents, even my brother
and sister, who would never have stood by while I got to do things they
couldn't.</LD>
<LD>   Yet in a way, my dream made perfect sense. I was a California child in
the 1960s. We lived in a housing tract in San Jose that had been carved
out of a walnut orchard. Front and back, every pastel-colored house had a
sheltering tree that showered oily nuts on the grass. Indoors, we had a
modern all-electric kitchen; outside, a concrete deck, complete with
brick fireplace.</LD>
<TE>   On summer nights, the whole neighborhood was out barbecuing, each
family clamoring around picnic tables, voices and radios mingling in the
air with the smell of meat and a sense of giddy freedom. Even my parents,
usually strict about bedtime, prolonged these nights. Once, in the
flickering dark of 9 o'clock, my dad suggested that we "sleep outside
under the stars."</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, I can't remember if we did. But the phrase lives in my mind, an
expression of reckless, thrilling possibility, right up there with
"circumnavigate the globe," or "walk on the moon" in its hint of a
mysterious yet manageable--and somehow friendly--cosmos.</TE>
<TE>   Such a view may come naturally to Californians, in particular,
Angelenos. We, more than those in tougher climates, can stay outside--to
sleep, eat, sit around, usually whenever we want to. For us, nature is
benign. In winter, our skies don't fling down snow, or even too much
rain; bugs don't descend in droves for summer, and it's rarely cold in
any season. And since enough people have moved here from somewhere
else--places bitter-cold, tornado-ridden, buggy--we're familiar with what
we're missing and feel blessed. But this goes beyond weather. In a
harder, more vertical city like New York, you tend to see yourself in
relation to buildings, paving, other people. We in L.A., given our
sprawling, garden-rich views, have a more active relationship with trees
and other greenery, and the shocking pink of bougainvillea. These don't
have to be, strictly speaking, ours. Because they're everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   If some do belong to us, so much the better. Here, any outdoor space,
a balcony or small back porch, can become a garden, a ready, year-round
escape hatch from the loud demands of indoor life. This doesn't mean that
when we go outside, we don't take our indoor lives along. For some
Angelenos, the garden is simply another version of the house, equipped
with an alfresco kitchen, dining room or fire pit, perhaps even a shower
and bed. Laptops and Internet hookups are sneaking into lounging nooks.
Televisions are popping up under pergolas.</TE>
<TE>   While some may wring their hands at such desecration of a "natural"
scene, others see this as part of a long progression, the modern
trappings of an old concept. The ancient Egyptians and Romans built
gardens as open-air extensions of the house. Medieval Europeans had
walled courtyards, and Spain is famous for its sunny, secluded patios. In
Southern California, as Los Feliz landscape designer Melinda Taylor
reminds us, "our outdoor living model is based on the Mediterranean idea
of cool, enclosed spaces with paths and flowing water." To the Spanish
missionaries, she adds, outdoor cooking, especially when it was hot, was
entirely practical.</TE>
<TE>   There are precedents, too, for using the outdoors for inspiration,
walking and thinking, say, as the ancient Greeks used to do. Joseph
Marek, who designs gardens in Santa Monica, notes that while laptops may
be recent inventions, writing in the open air is "a time-honored"
practice. What's more, he says, "Just about anything that gets you out
into your garden can probably be seen as good."</TE>
<TE>   Given a choice, whatever they do out there, most people try to weave
some privacy into the program. Potted trees or hanging plants might
screen a condominium balcony from neighbors. In the case of a house, the
English landscape movement of the 18th and 19th centuries gave us the
lasting legacy of the public-facing front lawn. So our fenced, secluded
backyards are where we spend our garden time. These retreats are often
linked to interior rooms via glass doors and rear decks that blur the
line between indoors and out, encouraging the perception of the garden as
the continuation of a sheltered space.</TE>
<TE>   This was a big concern to certain mid-20th century California
architects-- Richard Neutra, Thornton Ladd and A. Quincy Jones, among
them--who sometimes gave garden-oriented rooms the sliding walls of airy
pavilions.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of mid-century style today has renewed this interest in
a strong indoor-outdoor connection. It's a model for living that appeals
not only to high-end architects and those who came of age during the '50s
and '60s, but also to younger people who appreciate the spare but stylish
mid-century aesthetic. Equally simple and understated is a complementary
landscape approach developed decades ago by garden-makers such as Thomas
Church and Garrett Eckbo. In the post-World War II years, with house
sizes shrinking and families growing, their practical, informal gardens
catered to the outdoor lives of people who wanted to grill dinner as they
watched their kids bike around the patio.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't far from what many of us want now. In order of preference,
says Los Angeles landscape architect Sasha Tarnopolsky of Dry Design, "my
clients ask for outdoor dining spots, water features and fireplaces. They
want areas that are interesting and challenging for children but
sophisticated enough for grown-ups' parties."</TE>
<TE>   Such an agenda, of course, is hardly limited to those with means to
hire designers. KB Home, formerly known as Kaufman &amp; Broad, the
L.A.-based national builder specializing in entry-level home
developments, offers its buyers optional outdoor amenities such as patios
and decks for garden living. In response to customer demand, the company
plans to expand the options list to include built-in barbecues, patio
covers and paving options. In certain master-planned communities (such as
Amerige Heights in Fullerton), KB provides residents with communal
greenbelts, sports fields, playgrounds and even formal flower gardens
with benches for whiling away an afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, if you do have the means, you can create your own
greenbelt, not to mention a dining pavilion, a rushing stream or an
ozone-filtered swimming pool. With professional help, you can install
radiant-heated terrace floors to take the edge off chilly nights and an
automated computer-controlled lighting system. You can augment your
high-tech gas grill with a rotisserie, an adjacent cooktop, a
refrigerator, a plate-warmer and a sink.</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor cooking in itself has taken a leap forward since the '60s and
become something of a trendy pastime among people raised, like me, in an
era that glorified frozen food and processed meat. The outdoor menu can
be just as complicated as what you'd serve inside. But does this mean you
need two kitchens?</TE>
<TE>   My friend Jacob Epstein, a Los Feliz screenwriter who grew up in New
York City and gives legendary barbecues, says no. "I'm a minimalist
outside," he explains. "I load the mesquite into my basic Weber, arrange
corn around the grill's edge and put the meat or chicken in the middle.
It burns hot, it smells good, it makes me feel like I'm in the Wild
West."</TE>
<TE>   For sauces, salads and other side dishes that require a sink and
stove, he and his wife, Susie Norris, a television executive, use their
well-equipped indoor kitchen, which opens conveniently onto their garden.</TE>
<TE>   But another backyard L.A. chef I know, who wasn't satisfied with mere
garden grilling, had an outdoor kitchen installed with the help of
Kitchens Del Mar in Orange County. With a set-up that includes a
combination grill-stove, indoor-outdoor refrigerator, sink with garbage
disposal, black-granite counters and plenty of storage space, he augments
his favorite grilled fish with pureed soups, frittatas and pastas. "It's
really a brave new world out there," he says.</TE>
<TE>   While each carefully chosen tool in his outdoor kitchen has a purpose,
this isn't always the case at other homes. "An outdoor kitchen can be
little more than a status symbol," says Tarnopolsky, "stuff for the sake
of stuff." Brushed-steel appliances can also mar the serenity of flower
borders. And they're often too big to hide.</TE>
<TE>   Not that many of us have to try. An outdoor kitchen can top $40,000.
And considering the available space--maybe a few yards behind the
house--we're better off buying sturdy weatherproof furniture. Along with
a tall shade tree and leafy vine, this makes the garden inviting
year-round, even when you're inside looking out. "Even a picture of
relaxation can calm you down," observes Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The tiniest space can invite you to sit, says Barry Gilbert, CEO of
Smith &amp; Hawken, national purveyor of garden furnishings. Gilbert reports
that his company's best-seller in L.A. is the Saranac lounge, an ample
teak chair with optional well-padded cushions. Close behind is a
dish-shaped copper fire pit that can double as movable fireplace or
barbecue grill. "People are realizing that the garden may be the largest
room they have," says Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   Furnishing this room has become a multibillion-dollar business,
reports Becky Boswell Smith, editor-in-chief of Casual Living, a trade
magazine that tracks the outdoor furniture market. Its first-ever
national survey, which covered the year 2000, showed annual sales of $5.3
billion, with barbecue grills accounting for 50%, outdoor dining sets
21%, garden lighting 11% and lounge chairs 6%. Discount department stores
such as Kmart and Target were the No. 1 source for these, with specialty
patio stores second and home-improvement centers (such as Home Depot)
third, followed by department and hardware stores. Catalog, mail-order,
Internet and TV sales combined accounted for only 3% of the business.
"Customers still want to touch and feel the chair they're going to sit
in," says Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Where do most of these customers live? California, according to the
American Furniture Manufacturers Assn., which recently reported that
Californians bought almost a quarter of all outdoor furniture sold
nationwide last year.</TE>
<TE>   The hottest sellers on the market include chairs, tables and loungers
made of cast aluminum, wrought iron, teak and woven resin, which
resembles wicker but holds up better in inclement weather. And though you
can spend thousands on a single outdoor chair, it needn't cost the earth
to furnish a garden. In Casual Living's survey, the median price of a
five-piece dining set at a discount department store was $200.</TE>
<TE>   Why stop there? Jackie Hirschhaut, a spokesperson for the
furniture-makers association, says that "many consumers are not searching
for just a piece or two for the patio, but for entire groups that allow
them to furnish their outdoor space similar to the way they would an
interior room."</TE>
<TE>   Yet other outdoor living trends reflect the yearnings of the ages,
impulses that have long drawn people outside. Though we may not have
hours to garden, we want contact with plants. True, thanks to our busy
schedules, we tend to focus, as Thomas Church did, on low-maintenance
foliage. But the current popularity of variegated plants reflects our
fascination with pattern and texture. We don't want to be bored. Nor do
urban parents want to shortchange their children on tactile interactions
with nature. "My clients with kids want rocks, gravel pits, wild and
un-manicured spots," Taylor points out.</TE>
<TE>   More people seem interested in growing food, getting in touch, as
Tarnopolsky says, "with the endlessly cycling seasons." She also notes
that bathing outdoors is up there on the pleasure scale with picking
fruit off your own tree. Like standing under a waterfall. Or running
through sprinklers on a hot day.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, you do need a permit to build an outdoor shower. But you don't
need one to mount a hose bib six feet high--which is what a neighbor of
ours did when we lived for two years in Topanga Canyon during the late
'80s. Every morning, just past dawn, the hefty, gray-haired woman would
stride out naked to her rather public side yard and stand in the cold
torrent, communing with the elements. Water, weak sun, the strong smell
of eucalyptus. As if these were everything a person needed to thrive in
this world.</TE>

<LD>NATURE'S DINING ROOM</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles landscape designer Scott Shrader spent three years looking
at more than 300 houses before finding his 1940 Hollywood Regency-style
home in West Hollywood's "Norma Triangle." Bordering Beverly Hills, the
neighborhood is composed of modest '20s and '30s bungalows, many of which
were transformed in the late '50s into mansard-roofed Empire-style
dwellings. "Essentially they designed estate-like homes on tiny lots
maximizing every square inch," says Shrader, who was drawn to the
1,600-square-foot home because of its high ceilings and light-filled
living room, which opened onto a back garden.</LD>
<TE>   But the garden needed work. Initially the brick-paved backyard lay 3
1/2 feet below the level of the house. A row of dead cypress trees and
three run-down fences surrounded the yard. It took a week of demolition
to remove the brick hardscape and two additional concrete patios. What
remained was a long, narrow 24-by-45-foot open space. "The first thing I
did was add structure," explains Shrader. He constructed a 3-foot-high
masonry wall around the yard's perimeter. Seven truckloads of soil helped
to bring the garden to the same level as the house, "making the house
seem much larger than it is." He then divided the yard into three defined
spaces, each corresponding to a room inside so that each has its own
private garden. The central patio--just outside the living room--where he
reads, dines and talks on the phone, he calls "the best 'room' in the
house." Flanking the central garden space, two smaller outdoor rooms (18
feet by 24 feet and 14 feet by 24 feet) off the den and guest bedroom
function as a dining room and bar area, respectively, when Shrader
entertains. "I've had as many as 60 people here. They flow easily from
one garden room to another," he says. "Dividing the space created a more
architecturally interesting environment. It also adds a bit of mystery."</TE>
<TE>   Shrader fashioned "walls" for the outdoor rooms by planting 85
6-foot-high Ficus nitida. Two years after planting, the now 12-foot-tall
hedge walls around the perimeter of the garden are as high as his mansard
roof, while shorter 8-foot-high hedges mark side walls. Under the
200-year-old Guatemalan pavers, which are set in sand, are underground
soaker hoses that slowly irrigate the garden. "You have to be careful
about over-watering ficus," he warns. "They've very susceptible to
fungus."</TE>
<TE>   The central garden's focal point is a bronze-trimmed pool filled with
waterlilies, which surround Simon Toparovsky's "Icarus" sculpture.
Antique stone pavers and French limestone posts from a 17th century
castle flank openings to each room, adding a patina of age to the
3-year-old garden. "I love to come outside when everything is looking
great," says Shrader. And the designer takes a hands-on approach to
keeping his garden manicured. For the first two years he trimmed the
ficus with Felco clippers--normally used for cutting roses. He still
hand-trims the hedges but now uses a longer, 12-inch blade. "It's the
old-fashioned European way of cutting that gives you a tight, concise,
straight hedge," he explains. "I sometimes go out and tell the ficus how
great they are. They're like my babies."</TE>

<TE>THE CRASH PAD</TE>
<TE>   "My sultan's playroom, my flying carpet," designer Jay Griffith calls
the covered lounge he built on a Malibu hill overlooking the Pacific. His
impetus? "Getting out of the sun," he says. "I needed shelter, but I
couldn't sacrifice openness."</TE>
<TE>   Having surveyed his rolling 4 1/2-acre property, he chose a weedy
midpoint he describes as "halfway through the soliloquy, the pause
between stanzas." There, with assorted bits of scrap plywood, he hammered
out a 20-by-40-foot enclosure on a piece of raised redwood decking. For a
semi-transparent roof and one billowing wall, he hung up bamboo shades,
and to ground his structure, he added hay bales on either side. These, he
says, together with reflecting ponds made of horse troughs, relate to
"Malibu's agrarian soul. This is the country, not the city. It demands
the architecture of a barnyard."</TE>
<TE>   In a similarly casual spirit, he painted his lounge with a mix of
leftover odds and ends of stain. "Take a bunch of paint in every color,
throw it together, you get this," he observes, "the color of ragged-out
sage or chaparral."</TE>
<TE>   He scavenged most of his furnishings, too: a pair of king-size
mattresses from a Venice curb, Army surplus canvas for upholstery,
cushions excavated from a sale bin in a garden store. As you rest your
head, wind rattles the surrounding pepper trees and bamboo. If you're
hungry, there's a gas grill nearby--and a complete dinner service for 12
(plates, napkins, stemware, cutlery) in sealed Lucite drawers.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith, for whom garden buildings are often temporary and
changeable, entertains here often, holding Saturday night salons after
which guests sometimes fall asleep--in the outdoor boudoir. Says
Griffith, "It becomes a beach-side crash pad, circa 1966."</TE>

<TE>INSPIRED RECYCLING</TE>
<TE>   One wall of Sloane and Greg Mann's garden dining room is dark oak
trees. Another is a sunstruck row of potted cypresses, slim and widely
spaced, a suggestive edge rather than a real screen. In the same way, the
16-by-25-foot room is more a gracefully sketched space than an enclosure,
a comment about imposing order lightly on the land. A simple pergola of
redwood posts topped with slats evokes the room, which they conceived and
constructed themselves, furnishing it with a table that Greg designed
around recycled tile fragments. At the room's far end is a brick
fireplace that dates to the 1940s, when the couple's Altadena cottage was
built on the ruins of an earlier house destroyed by fire.</TE>
<TE>   Adjoining the fireplace was a cracked cement patio, the remnant of a
garden gathering spot. Otherwise, jade plants, ivy and trumpet vines ran
rampant across their three-quarters of an acre, and they had to remove a
medley of bird-seeded trees when they bought the cottage four years ago.
As they cleared and trimmed around the patio, they found the oak trees,
which formed a scrim that set off the ridge of mountains in the
background.</TE>
<TE>   Here, motivated by a party they had promised to host in honor of
Greg's father's retirement, they went to work, setting slate atop the
concrete, raising the redwood posts and crowning them with a hollow steel
frame they could thread with conduits for lights. Even the old fireplace
needed attention: Ivy had pulled apart its bricks, which required
restoration by a mason. After nailing slats on the pergola's roof, they
planted a sweet autumn clematis nearby, which will eventually drape the
structure in blooms each fall.  "That's the nicest time here," say Sloane
and Greg, both graphic designers and passionate chefs who like to stoke
the fire at a moment's notice and invite a dozen of their friends. A
sample menu? Chicken sausages, pork chops grilled on a bed of lavender
and truffle mashed potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   --S.H.</TE>

<TE>THE CONTEMPORARY TENT</TE>
<TE>   With its aluminum-trellis frame, sloping roof and canvas walls, Tina
Beebe and Buzz Yudell's poolside shelter resembles a large, comfortable
tent. By day, when its ochre curtains (made of sun- and mildew-resistant
fabric) are tucked back, you can see across the pool to a rose border and
a swath of ocean beyond. After dark, with the drapes snapped closed
against the onshore winds and the mounted landscape lights burning
inside, the tent glows like a lantern in the night.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always loved tents. I grew up going to summer camp and sleeping
in tents with wood floors," recalls Beebe, an architectural colorist who
designed the Malibu house and pool pavilion with her architect husband, a
principal in the Santa Monica firm Moore Ruble Yudell Architects and
Planners. The pavilion, she says, is "also a translation of the
old-fashioned sleeping porch, a place to nap in the heat and keep warm
and protected later, when the breeze blows up."</TE>
<TE>   Anchored by stucco columns that match those of their house, the simple
9-by-27-foot structure is surrounded by fragrant honeysuckle, lemon
verbena and various sages in addition to English and old roses. The focus
of the garden tent, Beebe says, is relaxing, though the couple has had
dinner parties there. Hence the furnishings: cushioned chairs, small
tables you can sling your feet on, and plenty of cushions.</TE>
<TE>   --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>A POOLSIDE PERCH</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, Pasadena designer Matthew White was lucky enough to
acquire a pool pavilion when he bought his 1924 Mediterranean-style
house. Designed in the mid-1980s by Pasadena landscape architect Mark
Berry, who also designed the pool, the tile-roofed guest house had a
ready-made 20-by-9-foot lounging spot in the shade of its tall columns.
An outdoor fireplace warms this poolside perch at night, while built-in
limestone-topped counters surround a barbecue, refrigerator and sink that
come in handy for garden dining. The limestone terrace floor, impervious
to wet feet, flows directly into the guest house, enhancing the
indoor-outdoor connection.</TE>
<TE>   But to make the area even more summer-friendly, White fitted the
covered terrace with canvas awnings, which can be extended in the noon
heat and retracted later to reveal the sky. In the interest of comfort,
when friends arrive he raids the pool house for wood folding tables and
upholstered chairs covered in cotton that won't be harmed by damp
swimsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "The main house is rather formal," White acknowledges. "Here we can
hang around in shorts, barbecue and feel totally part of the garden.
Since this part is enclosed by tall trees--crape myrtle, orange,
eucalyptus and palm--you have the sense of an outdoor
room-within-a-room."</TE>
<TE>   His favorite time is evening, when the trees, lit with landscape
lights, shimmer in the pool's watery mirror. "It's completely private and
protected here," he notes. "You've got the feeling of shelter, but you
can look out and enjoy the world."</TE>

<TE>WHAT'S COOKING</TE>
<TE>   For Beverly Hills interior designer Sandy Koepke, having a small house
was reason enough to build an outdoor dining room and kitchen. More to
the point, she says, "I'd rather be outside than inside--cooking, eating,
entertaining. That's why I live in this climate." Yet when she bought her
house five years ago, she was reluctant to plunk appliances in the
garden, an act she calls "an inappropriate invasion of nature."</TE>
<TE>   Her solution, inspired by her find of two 8-by-10-foot leaded windows
at an estate sale, was to construct a secluded garden room with the look
of an old greenhouse--vine-walled, rose-roofed but open to the breezes.
Located off her indoor dining room and accessible through glass doors,
the 21-by-16-foot space was conceived as an extension of the house that
would draw guests out with soft lights, the sound of a fountain, potted
plants and plenty of seating. And just beyond this green enclosure would
be an outdoor living room. "I designed these the way I'd design an indoor
space," Koepke says, describing the extensive concrete foundation she
needed to support her dining room's steel frame and also to contain
power, gas and water lines for lighting and cooking. The room's gravel
floor, along with the vines, French bistro chairs and barn lights,
suggests informal South of France living. The kitchen, tucked discreetly
into one end, features a gas grill with extra side burners, a copper
cold-water sink and a fabric skirt that hides storage shelves. There is
no refrigerator. "I put drinks in a tub of ice," she explains. "It's not
meant to be high-tech."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, to give the steel frame a rustic look of age, she coated it
with paint containing iron filings before planting the bougainvillea,
trumpet vine and 'Graham Thomas' roses that complete its walls.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Marvels</HD>
<DH>Urban Gardeners Are Often Forced to Do More With Less, Making the
Most of a Bare Porch, a Diminutive Side Yard or a View-Rich Rooftop</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about the great outdoors. You don't often find it in a city
garden, where urban gardeners work on bits of soil between buildings,
steal space along fences and covet turf where they can set chairs beneath
trees. But often, even to claim these, they have to view their lots
creatively and see potential where others have overlooked it. Is there a
place for containers? Can vines be trained up an empty wall? It doesn't
take much to add a hint of garden through a window, or dress up a
minuscule stoop and watch the moon from it. An old dog run can become a
path to a bench. Hanging baskets can turn a porch into a jungle. If you
rent and have a balcony, you can plant pots--and take them with you when
you move. If you lack ground, there's always the roof.</LD>
<LD>   For several L.A. gardeners and designers, this approach resulted in
the scenery on the following pages, gardens that were conjured out of
barren, neglected or stolen spots, places no one had previously
considered. Now they offer peace and quiet, a little green, some warm
sun, sweet scents. All that's needed to draw out city dwellers.</LD>
<TE>Designer Basia Kenton's garden for a 1941 Santa Monica apartment
building</TE>
<TE>   Before: Little grew around the six units except one Norfolk Island
pine, a boxwood shrub and an old pink rose.</TE>
<TE>   Problem: Without landscaping, the building looked like a prison,  and
tenants never lingered outside.</TE>
<TE>   Idea: Live-in owner filmmaker Catherine Grennan, who travels often and
 offers furnished rentals to people in town on movie business, wanted a
garden that would provide a sense of permanence and hospitality.</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration: California bungalow-court gardens of the 1940s and '50s
that mixed low-maintenance succulents and Mediterranean plants.</TE>
<TE>   Strategy: To create a patterned plant carpet that changes from unit to
unit--cistus and ceanothus giving way to roses and then cannas--and to
keep the unifying succulent edge. The carpet winds around the building to
 a communal dining/sitting spot with an herb garden and stone bench.</TE>
<TE>   Materials: A low stucco street-side wall for privacy; organic compost
to  enrich the soil; a decomposed granite top dressing to improve
drainage;  drip irrigation; a plant palette chosen for harmony or
contrast and easy care: agaves, aeoniums, echeverias, echium, rosemary,
helichrysum.</TE>
<TE>Architect Norman Millar's "sky basket" deck in Echo Park</TE>
<TE>   Before: Millar's mature tropical garden was a dense  jungle of green
around his small bungalow.</TE>
<TE>   Problem: From ground level, he couldn't see much sky  or sun or enjoy
the views of downtown and Elysian Park that surrounded his hilltop
property.</TE>
<TE>   Idea: To create a simple, two-part indoor/outdoor  shelter in which he
and visiting friends could sleep, lounge and climb into the treetops for
sky- and city-gazing.</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration: A treehouse; a floating air balloon; at  night, when lit,
a lantern.</TE>
<TE>   Strategy: To construct a small pavilion with an  enclosed roof deck
whose slatted sides, like blinds, would block the houses of immediate
neighbors but not  more distant views or sky.</TE>
<TE>   Materials: Vertical 10-foot fir two-by-fours for the  pavilion,
horizontal two-by-fours for the box, redwood  two-by-fours for the deck
floor, and custom-mixed  yellow-green paint intended to capture the color
of sun shining through leaves. Surrounding plants include  giant bird of
paradise and fan and queen palms.</TE>
<TE>Designer Gabriela Yariv's Pasadena porch garden for her parents,
Frances and Amnon Yariv</TE>
<TE>   Before: A tiny tiled landing outside  Amnon's home office.</TE>
<TE>   Problem: Amnon, a physicist, wanted a  garden view and a private place
in which to wander during work breaks, especially in the  afternoon, when
this west-facing, 4-foot-by-15-foot porch gets soft late sun. But there
was  little planting around the porch beyond a  lawn and a few gazanias.</TE>
<TE>   Idea: Use potted plants to make the porch inviting and create a garden
edge that adds privacy and lushness to the office view.</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration: The Yarivs' 1924 Spanish-style house with its stucco
walls and tile roof. Strategy: To echo the orange tiles with terra-cotta
pots and fill them with richly colored succulents and Mediterranean
plants appropriate to the house and to extend the Mediterranean palette
to the surrounding borders.</TE>
<TE>   Materials: Potted Agave attenuata with a  draping edge of Sedum
reflexum, pink echeverias, black aeoniums and fine-leafed melaleuca.
Surrounding in-ground plantings include  cypress and kumquats (for their
edible,  jewel-like fruit), fragrant rosemary and  heliotrope, and
blue-green senecio.</TE>
<TE>Steven Roffer and Robin Fisher Roffer's secret garden in Hancock
Park</TE>
<TE>   Before: Their 60-foot-by-7-foot side yard was a weed-choked
hodgepodge of overgrown shrubs, old hoses and other  debris--an unused,
neglected space.</TE>
<TE>   Problem: An existing pool and guest house--where they run their
business, Big Fish Marketing--took up most of the remaining garden. They
had no secluded sitting areas or places for their toddler, Roxanne, to
play alone safely.</TE>
<TE>   Idea: Since they work from home, they decided to turn the side yard
into an outdoor "think tank" space that would double as  private
meditation spot and play area. A mature existing lemon tree at the far
end offered a focal point and destination, and a  fountain beyond a
nearby wall provided water music.</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration: Gardens of the northeastern U.S., where Steven grew up
and loved the cool, lush summer greenery, and the semitropical gardens of
California, where ferns  and palms evoke a similar feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Strategy: They hired Todd Hall, a West Hollywood landscape designer
and contractor, to help them develop their idea, choose a good mix of
shade plants and install the garden. Materials: A meandering path of
Arizona flagstones, lattice added atop an existing fence to screen a
neighbor's house, organic soil amendments, automatic sprinklers, a
predominantly green-and-white plant palette featuring  hydrangeas, calla
lilies, three kinds of ferns, star jasmine and baby's tears, and an old
white bench that Hall painted orange to serve as a garden seat and focal
point.</TE>

<HD>A Bittersweet Leave-Taking</HD>
<DH>An Era Is Passing for Japanese Americans Who Once Found Livelihoods
in Gardening</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>

<LD>The juniper is sculpted into precise green mounds, held as if in
offering on the palms of outstretched branches. It stands next to the
driveway, where Kuni Tamura, 79, chases dried leaves, dust and loose
grass into a pile with a leaf blower.</LD>
<LD>   As Tamura steps into the Cerritos street, he turns and sees a single
leaf left behind. It would be easy to dismiss it, the way an orchard
worker might dismiss one small apple left hanging on a tree, but Tamura
quickly circles around and herds it to the pile with the others. The
morning and an era pass in abiding rhythms as Tamura sweeps up, loads his
van and moves on to the next client.</LD>
<LD>   In Southern California during the 1930s and 1940s, gardeners of
Japanese ancestry made up about 80% of the industry, says Cal State L.A.
sociology professor Ronald Tsukashima. For issei (first generation) and
nisei (second generation), the work served as a foothold during a time of
limited opportunities. Gardening allowed families to send children to
college, build churches and communities, carve out a place in America.</LD>
<TE>   But now, as postwar gardeners grow old, few of their children or
grandchildren are following in their steps, and an era is passing.
Footholds are almost always that way. They are meant to be left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost all my colleagues come from families where the father was a
gardener," says Tsukashima, 59. "Their attitude was the same. They wanted
their children to go into something else. They wanted them to go to
college and get into a white-collar situation. Had it not been for the
gardening of the second generation, a lot of third-generationers [sansei]
like myself would not have had an opportunity to go to college."</TE>
<TE>   Tamura and his wife, Toshiko, who did factory work, sent four of their
five children to college.</TE>
<TE>   "At least," he says, "I was able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   He is largely retired now, although he still works three days a week
and maintains about 16 customers to stay active. Gardening, he says, has
been good to him. He started in 1947 after returning home from Japan,
where he served as an interpreter in the Army following World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the employment office in Inglewood to apply for a job," he
says. "They never did call me. Other people that came after me, they
filled out the forms and they got called. I was the only one who didn't
get called. I was the only Japanese there. Maybe that's the reason they
didn't call. That's how I took it."</TE>
<TE>   A friend told him of some families who needed a gardener, so Tamura,
whose parents were truck farmers, became a gardener. It was that simple.
Like many of the Japanese Americans who entered gardening, Tamura knew
nothing about the work. He figured it out as he went along, and within a
few months, he had built a steady clientele.</TE>
<TE>   None of his children took up gardening, and that's fine with him.
Footholds are not legacies. For Japanese American gardeners, it is not
the work they hand down. It is the gift of sacrifice, hard work and the
notion of hope for a "better life" that inspires all immigrant families.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "It is so characteristically Japanese, the way lives were made more
tolerable by gathering loose desert stones and forming with them
something enduringly human. These rock gardens had outlived the barracks
and the towers and would surely outlive the asphalt road and rusted pipes
and shattered slabs of concrete. Each stone was a mouth speaking for a
family, for some man who had beautified his doorstep."</TE>
<TE>   --From "Farewell to Manzanar," by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James
D. Houston</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's first Japanese gardeners started work in the
late 1800s, some riding bicycles and strapping push mowers on their backs
to move from client to client, according to "Green Makers: Japanese
American Gardeners in Southern California," edited by Naomi Hirahara and
published last year by the Southern California Gardeners' Federation.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, most issei worked on farms throughout California as many
had done in Japan, but starting in 1913, California laws were changed to
prevent "noncitizens" from owning and, later, leasing farmland. The
practice of not allowing them to become citizens was formalized by law in
1922, when the Supreme Court limited naturalization to "free white
persons and aliens of African nativity."</TE>
<TE>   Many men arriving in the Los Angeles area from farms in search of work
stayed in boarding houses, which served as employment and training
centers for the gardening business. According to "Green Makers," there
were at least 78 of these boarding houses in the city before World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   When war began, people of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast
were forcibly imprisoned in hastily built relocation centers in remote
areas of the country. Even there, from bare ground never before irrigated
or cultivated, gardens sprang forth in an attempt to create more homelike
settings.</TE>
<TE>   "When I thought about children being raised in the desert without
grass or trees, I was sure they would become human beings who would not
feel joy or pleasure in anything," wrote Shoji Nagumo (referred to as the
"father of Southern California gardeners") in "Green Makers."</TE>
<TE>   So they planted and irrigated and created what beauty they could, and
when the war ended, many turned to gardening not as a means of adornment,
but as a means of survival.</TE>
<TE>   "Right after the war, gardening was the backbone of the Japanese
American economy," says Tsukashima, who teaches a class called "The Asian
American Experience" at Cal State L.A. "Gardening was one of the few
niches in the economy still open to the Japanese after the war. The
anti-Japanese atmosphere was quite significant. Even if you were an
educated nisei with a college degree, you had a lot of difficulty finding
work, so what a lot of the Japanese did, both issei and nisei, was to
funnel into gardening. This was their opportunity to support their
families."</TE>
<TE>   They formed associations and federations to help protect their
interests, share information and develop professional standards. In 1955,
the Southern California Gardeners' Federation was founded. Made up almost
entirely of gardeners of Japanese ancestry, its membership approached
4,000 in 1980 but has been steadily declining as members age.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, they did not create gardens patterned after
Japanese styles, says Kendall Brown, assistant professor of Asian art
history at Cal State Long Beach. What distinguished them was the quality
of their work.</TE>
<TE>   "More than the style of their work, it was dedication to the task,
really being concerned about doing it right, as opposed to the modern
mow, blow and go style," Brown says. "It was a sensibility, for example,
that you nurture trees, cut them back sharply and really care for the
tree."</TE>
<TE>   In their own yards, however, some gardeners incorporated a Japanese
touch: carefully pruned shrubs and trees, bonsais, representations of
natural elements such as earth and water.</TE>
<TE>   "If you write 'landscape' in characters, it's mountain and water,"
says Brown. "Since a garden is, at one level, a symbolic landscape, it
will have hard elements--rocks--and wet elements757954401fluid pattern."
More than beauty, it was hard work. That's what Annie Takata, 79, of
Arleta remembers most vividly. When her husband died of cancer in 1962,
she found herself with five children and no way to support them, so she
climbed into her husband's Ford pickup, learned to drive and took over
his gardening route.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first two weeks, I felt like my bones were going to break
apart," she says. "Every part of my body just ached so much, but I had to
keep going. I had to keep the children in school. One lady, a gardener's
wife, said, 'That's not dignified work,' but I had to make a living. I
had to exist some way."</TE>
<TE>   Takata quit gardening because of allergies, then worked at home
improvement stores before retiring in 1997. Nearly blind, she now spends
most of her time at home, where she built a koi pond and tends to
vegetables and the cymbidiums she loves. It is still hard work, but it
seems more than that now. Even though she can no longer see its beauty,
she says, her life would feel empty without a garden.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Yamasaki guides his lawn mower, its rubber wheels worn thin,
around the outer edges of the grass. Behind him, paper-like azaleas
cascade down the side of a granite planter like red and lavender water.
In the backyard of his home overlooking Glendale, there is a pear tree,
and in autumn its leaves turn a deep, sweet mixture of purple and red and
orange, reminding Yamasaki of candy.</TE>
<TE>   A third-generation Japanese American gardener, Yamasaki, 39, works
full time at the Los Angeles Zoo; in his off hours he often lends a hand
in friends' gardens for fun. "I don't know of a single nisei who wanted
their son or daughter doing this," Yamasaki says. "I was a little bit of
a dummy. I didn't listen."</TE>
<TE>   At age 4, he would ride his bicycle to his grandfather's house and go
with him on his gardening route. "Work hard," the old man would instruct.
"Do your best, especially on payday."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, he considered other careers. There was a time when he
thought he might become a mechanic or engineer. "I loved engineering," he
says, "but I loved plants more." He studied landscape architecture at Cal
Poly Pomona but quit school a couple credits shy of a degree in order to
work. He takes pride in doing the work that his father and grandfather
did.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was a gardener for the city of Santa Monica," he says, "and
people taking walks would go to the section he was taking care of because
they knew he was the type of guy who wanted things to be presentable. He
did good work, and because of that, people would communicate with him. It
was his forum for relating to other people."</TE>
<TE>   Yamasaki has two younger brothers, one a marketing manager and the
other a maker of eyeglass lenses. He says he finds increasing
satisfaction from his work</TE>
<TE>   . "I've been lucky. I've been able to do this kind of thing and make
people happy. That's the ultimate, which takes a long time. I can make
people happy, and that's not always the case in this field or in any
field."</TE>
<TE>   Yamasaki has two daughters, and a third child is due this fall. While
he loves his work, he says, he wishes it paid better. Like his father and
his grandfather, he wants his children to have more opportunities in
life, opportunities to be happy.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could be making another zero on my paycheck. I wish I could
drive a nicer car, but sometimes you have to be humble. I'm lucky to have
gotten this far, to the point where I am trusted and people say, 'Brian's
pretty good.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tom Shima of Venice also grew up as the son of a maintenance gardener.
From the time he was 6 till all the way through college, he spent summers
with his father. This time of year, when one perfect day follows another
in Southern California, or when he steps outside his home and hears a
mower purring in the distance, he thinks of his father, Matsusho
Shimabukuro, whose clients included Gene Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers the time he and his father were working at a home in
Beverly Hills and a woman was rushing her two young children to the car.
Both carried ice cream cones. The woman did not want them to get in the
car with their ice cream, so she looked around and saw Shima standing
there with his rake and grass catcher.</TE>
<TE>   "Just drop them on the ground," the woman told her children. Then,
looking at Shima, she said, "He'll pick it up."</TE>
<TE>   Shima was outraged and turned his back. His father, overhearing the
woman, walked to the children and told them to drop their ice cream.
Silently, he scooped it up and walked away.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, Shima, a television writer, gauges weather by his
perceptions as a youth. When it's cloudy and a storm seems about to hit,
he thinks about gardeners racing the rain to complete their work. When
it's cool but sunny, it is a good day for heavy work. Like the weather
and the sound of a mower, driving through Beverly Hills also brings back
memories of his father. Shima looks at the yards, magnificent in size and
scope but, even years later, somehow not as pretty as they once seemed.</TE>
<TE>   Not as pretty, he suspects, as they will ever be again.</TE>

<HD>Still Ahead of the Rest</HD>
<DH>Lucques Continues to Please Even With a Second Location in the
Works</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When a mutual friend introduced Suzanne Goin and Caroline Styne,
she did them a tremendous favor. Though both were involved with
restaurants at the time--Goin as chef de cuisine at Campanile, Styne as
manager of Jones Hollywood--they had never met, because the two places
were such different scenes. But once they did, the connection was
immediate.  Their first restaurant, Lucques, which is the name of Goin's
favorite French olive, is now 3 1/2 years old, and it's worth taking
another look at this terrific West Hollywood restaurant as Goin and Styne
prepare to open a new place this summer on West 3rd Street. It's a smart
location and is close enough to Lucques so that they can easily go back
and forth between the two restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   The two women, both in their 30s, share the same modern aesthetic. For
Lucques (and the new restaurant as well), they hired design icon Barbara
Barry to turn the funky space that was once Harold Lloyd's carriage house
into a sleek, contemporary restaurant with a soul. The serene lines of
Barry's design are reflected on the tablescape. La Brea Bakery bread
arrives bundled in white linen in a banette, the round reed baskets that
French bakers use for proofing breads. Beside it is a slice of sweet
butter, a tiny bowl of fluffy fleur du sel and an oval dish of warm,
oil-drenched almonds and the juicy green olives that are the restaurant's
namesake.</LD>
<TE>   The menu is just one printed sheet, fastened to a wooden support with
a wide rubber band, and is unpretentious and easy to read. As small as
the menu is, there are usually so many things you'd want to order that
choosing can be harder than you'd think, especially when it comes to the
first courses, which are Goin's strength.</TE>
<TE>   Take her avocado salad, a fan of perfectly ripe Reed avocado showered
with minced shallots, intensely peppery organic upland cress, and tiny
jewel-like red and gold beets. She tucks shredded duck confit into a
lovely salad of toasted walnut halves, long-bladed dandelion leaves and
luscious orange persimmon, with its balance of sweet to tart punctuated
with pomegranate seeds. This season she's sending out plates of
prosciutto di Carpegna and tender fresh burrata set off with a green fava
bean puree that tastes of spring, with grilled Maui onions and shaved
pecorino cheese. It's exactly the kind of dish an Italian friend would
throw together for an unexpected guest with ingredients from the pantry
and garden.</TE>
<TE>   One day at lunch, which may be my favorite meal at Lucques, I started
with velvety slices of seared albacore garnished with chopped, sweet
lemon flesh, thin, transparent lemon slices and a potato salad dressed in
a garlicky aioli. It doesn't sound revelatory, but it was. I find when I
sit down to write about Lucques, the flavors of dishes I've eaten months
before are vividly etched in my memory. This is not a restaurant where
you'll ask yourself the next day, "Just what did I have, anyway?"</TE>
<TE>   Goin might decide one day to make a dusky wild mushroom ragout and
serve it on a delightful parsnip puree and garnish the whole thing with
the first pea shoots of the season. Or she may take those same earthy
mushrooms and use them to top a tart covered with tangy molten Gruyere.
She tends to keep her flavors clear and distinct. If she were a painter,
she'd be an Impressionist, the way she lays down intense strokes of color
on the plate.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Berkeley's Alice Waters and our own Mr. Puck, the
godmother and godfather of California cuisine, everybody has learned to
talk the talk. Seasonal cooking. Local ingredients. But Goin shows more
dedication to the idea than most. She cooks food for the Los Angeles
climate, and her menus are based on flavors that make sense together. She
rarely stretches for effect. You won't find foie gras and litchi nut
here, or at least I hope not. An excursion to the farmers market may turn
up a dish, for example, that I had at my last meal at Lucques: nettle
pasta with crinkly little morels, fresh peas and a spoonful of
mascarpone. Or a bowl of English peas cooked with mint and lettuce
chiffonade.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to main courses, she considers everything on the plate
as a whole. Grilled Atlantic snapper might be set on green rice dotted
with pine nuts. It has a backbeat of chile that she cools down with a
dollop of yogurt-dill sauce. I love her black bass, too, sauteed and
deglazed with tangerine juice. Even someone dedicated to meat could love
this fish.</TE>
<TE>   Other standouts include suckling pig with its crackling crust, and a
juicy veal chop with cavolo nero (Tuscan black cabbage) and truffle
butter. Goin has a thing for birds, too. The idea of pairing roast squab
with its rare, almost livery, flesh with delicious, chewy grains of farro
and nuggets of sweet kabocha squash is inspired. But the dish loses focus
with a sauce that is also somewhat sweet. In fact, she often serves main
courses in wide bowls with a splash of broth, as if to throw in extra
vitamins like the mother urging her children to finish every spoonful.
But it doesn't do every dish a service. Occasionally, she can err on the
side of being too rich. Take the wild mushroom lasagna with shell beans.
I like the combination of the wild mushrooms (all different sorts) with
the starchy softness of the beans, but the dish itself is so rich it
lacks the clarity of Italian cooking. It tastes like what it is: a
French-trained chef doing lasagna.</TE>
<TE>   What I appreciate most at Lucques is how deeply civilized it is. The
experience is about more than just food. It's people taking the time to
go out to dinner with their intimates and friends, and that's where Styne
comes in. The restaurant staff members try to do everything within their
power to make the evening expansive and fun. Her touch comes into the
wine list, too. Styne isn't handing the responsibility over to someone
else, but turning it into a personal learning experience. The list
continues to evolve as she discovers interesting new wines and producers.</TE>
<TE>   The other thing I find appealing is the cheese selection. It's not
vast, and that's its virtue. For example, whatever cheeses are
offered--and it's usually just three--they're at their peak, each
beguiling in its own way. It could be a brin d'amour from Corsica--shaggy
with herbs--a roaring '40s blue and, perhaps, a chalky tomme de chevre.</TE>
<TE>   Desserts sidestep the flashy in favor of the sensual pleasure of a
deep chocolate pot de creme with sugary shortbread cookies the size of
silver dollars. Or a wedge of seductive, dense olive oil cake topped with
softly whipped unsweetened cream and candied tangerine wedges. Desserts
have definitely perked up with the addition of pastry chef Kimberly
Sklar, who moved over from Campanile. Her contributions include a walnut
dacquoise with ricotta, mascarpone and rhubarb compote, and the Tunisian
pastry brique, with alternating layers of pistachios and honey.</TE>
<TE>   No time or inclination for a full meal? Slip onto a bar stool and nosh
on a prosciutto and butter sandwich, herbed fries, or a cheese plate.
After 10 p.m., you can get an omelet with soft herbs and cantal. What
serious restaurant offers an omelet anymore? Along with steak frites or a
plate of spaghetti carbonara? It's a fine way to eat late or dine alone.
For such a popular restaurant the staff at Lucques is unusually
evenhanded in the way it treats people. Styne is there every night, and
so is Goin, which is part of why Lucques is so successful.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Lucques is always a restaurant I can count on. If I send
friends there, I know they'll not only enjoy the food, but also have a
fine time.</TE>

<HD>Arroyo Seco Plan: Boosting Nature and Amenities</HD>
<DH>Land: For its 1,000 acres of the canyon, Pasadena seeks to
add or upgrade parking, playing fields and a campground, plus
preserve habitat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasadena has a vision for the Arroyo Seco, one that combines modern
amenities alongside rustic features in the sprawling river system
that plunges out of the San Gabriel Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   Among the highlights of that vision: new and upgraded playing
fields, an overnight camping area, more parking and better access to
certain parts of the arroyo and an increase in the number of events
held each year at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The goals for the 1,000 acres of the arroyo within city boundaries
are contained in a development blueprint released last week.</LD>
<TE>   Almost two decades in the making, the Arroyo Seco Master Plan
offers a glimpse into how Pasadena foresees the use and protection of
the canyon, named for an intermittent river that runs from the base
of the San Gabriels to the Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unleashing a very exciting process, by reaching into the
past and extending into the future," said Tim Brick, managing
director of the Arroyo Seco Foundation, a nonprofit group created by
author and preservationist Charles Lummis more than 100 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's only one page in the five-volume document, the Rose
Bowl Use Plan may have the most immediate impact for residents living
near the arroyo. Currently, the Rose Bowl hosts about 14 events a
year that, with at least 20,000 attendees each, are considered
"major" by the city's definition. The plan would boost that number to
25.</TE>
<TE>   How the Rose Bowl Operating Committee might reach that higher
number is uncertain. The Los Angeles Galaxy, which plays at the Rose
Bowl, is poised to move to a soccer-specific stadium in Carson next
year, and plans are taking shape for a 64,000-seat football stadium
in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl's contract with UCLA, which uses the stadium for its
home games, expires after the upcoming season, and the team is said
to have had preliminary talks with the group hoping to build the
downtown stadium.</TE>
<TE>   'The Genteel and the Wilderness'</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the master plan seems to embody the description that
State Librarian Kevin Starr has used for the Arroyo Seco itself: "a
juxtaposition of the genteel and the wilderness."</TE>
<TE>   In some areas, the natural habitat would be preserved, if not
restored, under the plan; in other spots it would be replaced with a
more managed, user-friendly version of itself.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of the work proposed in the plan would complete deferred
maintenance; the rest would be new projects, many of which have
already been presented to city residents, according to Pasadena
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anything in here people haven't already
seen. Nothing here should be new to anybody," said Kathy Woods,
administrator of the Parks and Natural Resources Division of the
city's Public Works and Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the plan contains a lot of what the community wants,"
Brick said of the plan released Thursday. "I hope people get real
involved in it and use the review period and the whole process as a
real opportunity to better define what the community wants."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he added, "I get a little worried we are getting a little
too utilitarian about the arroyo."</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the plan concerns the 300-acre Hahamongna Watershed
Park, to the south of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   More than 75 projects have been identified within the Hahamongna,
including more parking lots, an amphitheater, a supervised overnight
camping area and two new athletic fields, one of which would be
fashioned from an unused overflow basin.</TE>
<TE>   Half of 'Disc Golf' Course to Be Moved</TE>
<TE>   To preserve natural habitat in the park, the city plans to
relocate half of an 18-hole course for Frisbee golf--or "disc golf,"
as it is called in the plan--to another area.</TE>
<TE>   South of the Hahamongna, in the central Arroyo Seco, the master
plan focuses on preserving the status quo while upgrading some
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   That area, around the Rose Bowl, is a popular recreation spot for
cyclists, walkers, runners and ball players, and city planners hope
to repave parking lots, improve roads and trails, and post better
signs. The master plan also includes the creation of a grand
ceremonial entrance on the west side of the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In the lower arroyo, south of the Colorado Street bridge, "the
concept is bringing the area back" to its natural state, Woods said.
A bird sanctuary, improved trails and the expansion of a habitat
restoration project already underway are included in the plan.</TE>
<TE>   A Chance to Hear Residents' Comments</TE>
<TE>   Residents will have 45 days to review and comment on the master
plan and the environmental impact report that accompanied it before
the City Council takes up the matter, expected as early as late
summer.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope to raise the money for the projects through
grants and available funds after the plan and environmental report
have been approved. They do not have a price tag for the whole plan,
but they estimate it would take $30 million to implement just the
Hahamongna part. Only about $4 million of that has been raised,
mostly from the 1996 Los Angeles County Park Bond Act.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said she believes that the master plan tries to balance
restoring some areas to their natural state with making others
available for public use. "All my life, I've watched this area," she
said. "I'm really excited about the things that are going on."</TE>
<TE>   Copies of the master plan are available for viewing at all
branches of the Pasadena Public Library and at the city's Planning
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic copies will be available next month on the city's Web
site, www.ci.pasadena.ca.us.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena will hold a meeting to hear public comments at 6 p.m.
June 25 at the Victory Park gym, 2575 Paloma St.</TE>

<HD>Seeking to Help Teenage Latinas Avoid Pregnancy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As teenage birthrates in California and the nation fall to the lowest
level in decades, 16-year-old Ana Maria finds herself on the wrong
side of the statistics.</LD>
<LD>   The San Gabriel Valley girl is three months pregnant, despite what
she calls a strict upbringing and warnings by her mother to be
careful. In late October, when her baby is born, she will join a
populous sisterhood of young Latinas, who have the highest teenage
birthrate of all major racial and ethnic groups in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   That has prompted a spate of new research and educational
campaigns aimed at preventing early pregnancies and overcoming
cultural and language barriers that have inhibited the kind of
reductions in birthrate achieved among other groups. Among the
factors cited by the studies are many Latino parents' reluctance to
discuss sexual issues with teenagers and a shortage of health advice
available in Spanish, especially for low-income girls.</LD>
<TE>   The stakes for California and the nation are enormously high: In
the next 20 years, the Latino teenage population is expected to rise
by 60%, and experts fear that a growing pool of young mothers and
their children will be vulnerable to poverty, inadequate health care
and welfare dependence.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a tremendously negative impact not only on the lives of
these young girls and the communities in which they live but on
society as a whole," said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles),
whose largely Latino district includes a wide swath of downtown Los
Angeles, Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles. Roybal-Allard is
involved in efforts to reduce teenage pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The overall drop in the U.S. teenage birthrate, though still high
compared with other developed countries, has been hailed as a
significant achievement by health officials. Experts say that girls
and boys are having less sex and using more effective contraceptives,
perhaps prompted by concerns about contracting sexually transmitted
diseases. The teenage birthrate decreased by 20% nationally and by
31% in California in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Latinas' Birthrate Is Stubbornly High</TE>
<TE>   Declines were recorded among every ethnic group. For example, from
1990 to 1998, the birthrate in California declined by 41% among white
teenagers, by 37% among black teenagers and by 12% among Latina
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   But the rate among California Latinas, though down, remains
stubbornly high at 90.5 births per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19,
compared with 59.9 for black teenagers and 20.7 for whites. Although
African American girls are slightly more likely than Latinas to
become pregnant, they are also more likely to have an abortion,
accounting for their lower birthrate.</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that Latinas have higher rates of sexual activity and
lower than average rates of contraceptive use.</TE>
<TE>   Experts are beginning to explore social and cultural conditions
that might explain the variations and lead to new preventive
programs.</TE>
<TE>   A study funded by the California Wellness Foundation being
released this month found that Latino youths in particular have
difficulty getting access to contraceptives and other resources
because of language barriers and fear among undocumented immigrants
of using public services.</TE>
<TE>   The study, a part of the Get Real About Teen Pregnancy Prevention
Campaign, concludes that foreign-born Latino youngsters who adapt
quickly to their new environment, particularly through education and
learning English, are less likely to become pregnant or engage in
sex.</TE>
<TE>   Family planning was not something she gave much thought to, said
Ana Maria, who asked that her last name not be used.</TE>
<TE>   She came to this country from Mexico a year ago and is taking an
English-language course in adult school, but has never been enrolled
in American high school classes.</TE>
<TE>   Her Family Expected Purity</TE>
<TE>   Ana Maria said she was expected by her family, especially her
protective brothers, to be chaste. She had been secretly dating her
21-year-old cousin for two months when she got pregnant. She now
lives with him at the home of an aunt.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could go back [in time] I would speak to my mom and family
about my relationship; I'd get married and then plan my pregnancy,"
she said during a visit to the East Valley Community Health Clinic in
West Covina, where she receives medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies report that the emphasis placed on family in many
traditional Latino households promotes higher fertility rates among
older and younger women alike.</TE>
<TE>   An upcoming UCLA study, commissioned by the group Latino Coalition
for a Healthy California, is surveying American-born Latinas, recent
immigrants and white teenagers in Los Angeles and the wide variations
among the groups in birthrate, marital status and education level.</TE>
<TE>   The findings suggest that recently arrived immigrants who are poor
are more likely to have higher rates of pregnancy and birth.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies across the country are looking at why birthrates
among Cubans and, to an extent, Puerto Ricans, are lower than Mexican
American teenagers and those from some South and Central American
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Poverty Tied to Ignorance of Sexuality</TE>
<TE>   "When a young woman is impoverished, she has very little
information about sexuality and family planning, and teen pregnancy
is more of an issue," said Lia Margolis, president of Latino
Coalition for a Healthy California.</TE>
<TE>   The group hopes to use the UCLA study results to design
educational programs that target specific Latino populations.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra, 17, who was also at the West Covina clinic, got
pregnant in Mexico and was sent to live with California relatives by
her parents, who refused to let her see her 17-year-old boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   She believes lack of communication with her parents about sex,
contraception and other issues contributed to her naivete.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, she said, forbade her to have a boyfriend until she
was 20 or ready to marry.</TE>
<TE>   "So I went behind their backs," said Alexandra, who is due to give
birth in June. "I think now I would have waited to finish school and
maybe used birth control."</TE>
<TE>   Parents who are averse to discussing sexuality is a common thread
among the mostly Latino girls she sees, said Victoria Derrick, the
clinic's director of health promotion.</TE>
<TE>   The California Wellness Foundation study found that "in an effort
to avoid discussing the topic, many Latino parents will rely on
public schools to educate their children about sex and reproductive
health."</TE>
<TE>   But Roybal-Allard and others say that many Latino parents are
beginning to understand the importance of discussing such issues with
their children. And upcoming media campaigns will target Latino radio
and publications.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also point out that teenage parents need not lose all hope
of improving their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Daneen Rodriguez is a 15-year-old 10th-grader and mother of
9-month-old Damian. Melissa Reynoso, 17, is a senior and has a
2-year-old daughter, Faith Rose.</TE>
<TE>   Both of the Workman High School students attend an innovative
state-funded parent education program at the City of Industry school
that encourages them to graduate and set personal goals.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, who was awarded a $1,000 college scholarship for her
high test scores, wants to become a paralegal.</TE>
<TE>   Reynoso is planning to attend Mt. San Antonio College this fall
and eventually law school at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Both say their lives have been dramatically changed by motherhood:
They have forfeited part of their own childhoods to take on new
responsibilities and would plan differently if they could.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say to young girls and boys, if you're having sex, use
protection, and if you're not having sex, don't," said Reynoso.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize the consequences that come with sex. I think
my friends have learned from my experience."</TE>
<TE>   There are 30 pregnant or parenting teenagers in the class,
including two young fathers.</TE>
<TE>   Seven are graduating this spring and four of them are going on to
college, said program coordinator Marny Shay.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen babies are enrolled at an on-site child-care center that
also serves as a practicum on infant development that students must
attend for one hour each day.</TE>
<TE>   "We push them toward the expectation that they will go to college
rather than the expectation that they won't," Shay said of the mostly
Latinos in the class.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of the girls are the first in their families to
graduate. Education is not a priority, but when it becomes a
priority, you will see the birthrate come down, whether it's Latino
or any other culture."</TE>

<HD>Blake Funding of Aide's Defense Questioned</HD>
<DH>Law: Some experts say the attorney for the actor's
bodyguard in the murder case might have conflicting loyalties, but
others see no problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Blake's decision to pay the $1-million bail and bankroll the
defense of a bodyguard who allegedly helped the actor plan his wife's
murder last year raises ethical questions about what he may expect
for his money, some legal experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a little bit naive to believe anyone is so charitably
inclined that they put up $1 million in cash for somebody's bail, and
also pay that person's legal fees just out of concern" for them, said
Peter G. Keane, dean of the Golden Gate University School of Law in
San Francisco. "That simply defies belief."</LD>
<LD>   But other experts say the arrangement is fine as long as the
defense lawyer for the bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, does not favor
Blake's interests over her client's.</LD>
<TE>   "In our society, of paramount importance is the right of the
accused to counsel of their choice," said attorney Diane L. Karpman,
who specializes in legal ethics.</TE>
<TE>   State Bar of California ethics rules say an attorney may be paid
by someone other than the client if "there is no interference with
the [attorney's] independence of professional judgment or with the
client-lawyer relationship."</TE>
<TE>   The financial relationship between Blake and defense attorney Arna
H. Zlotnik, who represents Caldwell, seems inappropriate to those who
wonder how a criminal defense attorney can accept money from one
defendant to represent another in the same case without feeling some
loyalty to whoever is paying the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "Blake's interests are to make sure that Caldwell does not in any
way harm Blake," said Keane, a former chief assistant public defender
in San Francisco and an ethics expert. "Caldwell's interests are to
make sure that Caldwell comes out as best he can even if he has to
harm Blake."</TE>
<TE>   Blake and Caldwell were arrested last month and charged in the May
4, 2001, fatal shooting of Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, near a
Studio City restaurant. They have pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allege that Blake, 68, pulled the trigger. Caldwell,
46, who authorities believe was out of town on the night of the
shooting, was charged with conspiracy to commit murder.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Attys. Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory A. Dohi said in
court documents that Zlotnik's relationship with Blake "undermines
her independence of judgment and casts doubt on the integrity of all
proceedings against her client."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors also said Zlotnik may be called as a witness. She
was with Caldwell last June when police searched his Burbank
apartment and Jeep and found a supply list that authorities say link
Caldwell to Blake's alleged plot to kill Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash is expected
to rule Monday on whether Zlotnik may continue to represent Caldwell.
She has been Caldwell's lawyer for almost a year.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the criminal investigation in the Bakley case, Zlotnik
has maintained a low profile, making few public statements. In a
motion filed Thursday, she wrote that Caldwell's "confidence in his
lawyer is vital to the defense."</TE>
<TE>   Blake's lawyer, Harland W. Braun, said he recommended that
Caldwell retain Zlotnik, a former public defender, last year. She
works in the same Century City building as Braun and sometimes makes
brief court appearances for him.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said Blake had an obligation as an employer under the
state's labor law to pay Caldwell's legal bills.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics expert Karpman said Caldwell might prefer Zlotnik to a
public defender or a court-appointed lawyer who might not have the
same time and resources to devote to his defense.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said that to remove Zlotnik from the case would
delay court proceedings, at least while the ruling was appealed. The
matter could be resolved by asking another lawyer to consult with
Caldwell, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Caldwell should have independent counsel," said former Los
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian, "to analyze the
potential conflict and advise him whether or not he should have
separate counsel."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Barry Tarlow said there is no proof that Zlotnik
is acting unethically.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd have to conclude that the lawyer is a dishonest person who
will not protect the client's own interests, and I have seen no
evidence of that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald F. Uelmen, a professor at the Santa Clara University School
of Law, said it is common for attorneys for co-defendants, such as
Blake and Caldwell, to work together. "The fact that they are
conferring with each other doesn't in itself create a conflict," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell, for his part, filed a document Thursday asking the judge
to let him keep his lawyer. In the document, he stated, "I genuinely
believe that Ms. Zlotnik serves my interests despite her source of
fees."</TE>

<LD>A kitchen fire caused $500,000 in damage Saturday to Jerry's Famous
Deli in the 12600 block of Ventura Boulevard, Los Angeles Fire
Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.</LD>
<LD>   About 55 firefighters battled the 8:30 a.m. blaze, which was
reported after a passerby saw flames on the roof. Humphrey said the
fire started accidentally in the kitchen and may have spread through
the ventilation system.</LD>
<LD>   One employee suffered minor burns to his hands, officials said.
Damage to the building was estimated at $250,000, and damage to the
contents was another $250,000, Humphrey said.</LD>

<LD>A big-rig driver died Saturday in a crash that trapped him inside his
burning cab, the California Highway Patrol said.</LD>

<HD>Church Lawsuits Aim to Sidestep Local Zoning Rules</HD>
<DH>Land use: At least seven institutions in California go to
court using a federal law to overturn building restrictions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least seven churches, synagogues and religious schools throughout
the state have filed lawsuits against cities as part of a nationwide
effort by religious groups to use a new federal law to overturn local
zoning restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   The groups are invoking the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act, passed in 2000, to gain leverage in
states where they say churches are routinely denied building permits
in favor of projects that bring in tax revenue. The law prohibits any
land use regulation that is a "substantial burden" on the practice of
religion.</LD>
<LD>   About 30 lawsuits have been filed nationwide under the law, and
attorneys involved anticipate two dozen more by the end of next year.</LD>
<TE>   It's a trend that has alarmed many land-use experts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really far-reaching," said James Kushner, visiting
professor of law at USC, who offered an example of how the law, taken
to its extreme, could be invoked.</TE>
<TE>   "You can have a city like Irvine where rigorous architectural
design review is part of the community, and along comes a religious
group that wants to build a Day-Glo orange structure with a gold lame
facade in the middle of a residential neighborhood, and they would be
able to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So-called mega-church proposals are behind many of the lawsuits.
The projects are particularly challenging for city planners because
they draw thousands of people a week and often require major
infrastructure improvements. They are too big for residential
neighborhoods, but they don't bring in the sales tax revenue that
cities look for in their commercial zones.</TE>
<TE>   Church attorneys throughout the country cite the case of
Cottonwood Christian Center in Cypress as an example of how they say
cities can bully religious groups. Cypress officials want to toss the
church off its land so a Costco can go in its place. The city is
expected to vote May 28 to take the land by eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor Bayless Conley said the church filed its case after being
backed into a corner. He said the 18-acre site the congregation
bought for $14 million a few years ago is the only place in the area
where their planned facility would fit. The church is operating with
a 700-seat sanctuary in neighboring Los Alamitos, and a total of
4,000 people come to six services each weekend. Hundreds more are
turned away.</TE>
<TE>   "We had an extra 2,000 people visit us the weekend after Sept.
11," he said. "I'll guarantee you not one person ran to a Costco
store. We never expected something like this to happen in a million
years. It's been a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   The city is showing no signs of backing down. City officials say
they warned the church not to buy the property--a claim the church
denies--and that they have every right to redevelop one of the city's
busiest intersections in a way that will stimulate the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Bill Wynder says the Constitution is on the side of
Cypress. At the very least, he predicts that the courts will rule
that the new law does not apply to a city's ability to take land by
eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   But he thinks they will go further than that.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a law conferring a special benefit on religion," he said.
"It will be held a violation of church and state." Wynder and others
say discrimination is not the issue, because churches are already
treated like everyone else in a state where being forced to sell land
you own in a redevelopment zone is a fact of life.</TE>
<TE>   Congress approved the act after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
a similar law passed on civil rights grounds was an unconstitutional
incursion on state and local authority. The court said the federal
government failed to prove a pattern of discrimination. Congress
passed the new version not as a civil rights mandate but as a
condition cities must satisfy to receive federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   The courts are now determining whether the new law is legal, and
if so, what exactly constitutes a "substantial burden" to religious
groups. Experts anticipate that it will take another U.S. Supreme
Court decision to sort out the matter--and that could be years away.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys who have filed cases say they are only trying to get
churches' rights equal to other landowners.</TE>
<TE>   "California has a reputation of being one of the most
discriminatory places in terms of planning for churches," said Brad
Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, a Sacramento
nonprofit that has filed several lawsuits on behalf of West Coast
churches. "This law simply makes sure local governments do not
prevent a church from living and growing unless there are legitimate
health and safety concerns."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, a small Orthodox Jewish congregation invoked the
law after the city refused to let its members convert a house in a
busy residential neighborhood into a synagogue. The congregation
argued in court that the religion required members to walk to
services on the Sabbath, so a synagogue was needed in the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   A judge ordered the case into settlement negotiations, and the
synagogue was ultimately approved. Susan Azad, an attorney for the
congregation, said the new law "made our case for us."</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed under the act by Foothill Christian Ministries
against El Cajon was also recently settled, with churches winning the
right to locate in commercial areas without having to fight for
special permits. The suit was filed after the ministry was told it
could not build a sanctuary to seat 2,000 people, a day-care center
and gym in a largely vacant mall pegged for redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   A few district court judges have ruled that the law does, indeed,
stop short of giving religious groups freedom to ignore zoning. A
federal district court judge upheld San Jose's refusal to allow a
Christian college to convert a hospital into a campus, finding that
the decision did not place a substantial burden on the free exercise
of religion.</TE>
<TE>   The American Planning Assn., which lobbied against the act, is now
scouring the dockets for an ideal test case to join in the hopes of
getting the law stricken down in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has an absolute right to use property the way they
choose," said Vivian Khan, an Oakland planning consultant and member
of the association's national legislative committee. "That is what
land-use regulation is all about."</TE>

<HD>For Some, It's Too Late to Overturn Convictions</HD>
<DH>Law: Judges are refusing to review cases involving tainted
officers if inmate is no longer in custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Jorge Armando Torres was arrested four years ago on suspicion of
selling $10 of rock cocaine, he told his attorney that the LAPD
officers were lying. But facing a trial where his word would be
pitted against that of two Rampart Division officers, he agreed to a
plea bargain.</LD>
<LD>   Since Torres finished serving nine months in county jail, judges
have overturned nearly 150 convictions in cases that relied on
evidence from allegedly corrupt Rampart cops. In almost all these
cases, the convicts were released from prison, parole or probation.</LD>
<LD>   Torres thought that he, too, had a chance to have his record
cleared. After all, one of the officers who arrested him was later
charged with cocaine trafficking and was under investigation in
connection with a murder. And both officers were accused of
misconduct by disgraced former Rampart Officer Rafael Perez.</LD>
<TE>   However, Torres' request was rejected in February by Judge Larry
P. Fidler, who said that convicts already out of jail and off
probation are not legally entitled to have their convictions reviewed
in court. The judge suggested that Torres, 23, should instead apply
to the governor for a pardon.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-three other former inmates in situations similar to Torres'
have also filed petitions in Los Angeles County Superior Court. They
say they were wrongfully convicted because of false testimony and
evidence supplied by tainted police officers. But they also cannot
get their convictions reviewed in court hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The situation has sparked legislation that would give such former
inmates a guaranteed right to have their cases heard by judges.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the right thing," said author Sen. John Burton (D-San
Francisco). "The record would be cleaned like it all never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors statewide counter that such a law would result in a
flood of petitions, most filed by those who indeed are guilty.</TE>
<TE>   In cases where defendants are no longer behind bars, their
convictions continue to affect their lives. They often serve as
"strikes" under the state's tough three-strikes law and can prohibit
them from participation in drug-treatment programs under Proposition
36. A criminal record also puts convicts at risk of deportation and
prevents them from getting certain jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Even though judges are routinely denying the requests, defense
attorneys have continued to file two kinds of petitions: habeas
corpus and coram nobis. However, judges have ruled that habeas corpus
applies only to people in custody or on probation or parole. Coram
nobis, meanwhile, requires the petitioner to show that a specific
fact--unrelated to his guilt or innocence--would have prevented the
conviction had it been known at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Public defenders are also asking judges to use their judicial
power to create some kind of "equitable relief" because of egregious
police misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "How does our court system right the wrongs of the falsely accused
and convicted? It is by saying, 'Too bad,'" Torres' attorney, Deputy
Public Defender Fred Manaster, wrote in court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Manaster said the irony is that the people who are still serving
time have more rights than those who have completed their sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Public Defender Michael Judge began lobbying
for reform soon after Perez revealed that some Rampart Division
officers had planted drugs and weapons and lied in court. Judge said
the defendants are being punished because of the length of time that
the misconduct was concealed. If the corruption had become public
earlier, many of the defendants would still be on probation or parole
and entitled to habeas corpus relief.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying that people should automatically get their
convictions set aside," said Judge, who has lobbied for the
legislation. "That's up to us to demonstrate that, in fact, they were
wrongfully convicted."</TE>
<TE>   But judges don't even allow defense attorneys to appear at a
hearing and present their evidence of police misconduct, he said.
"That's what we're trying to remedy."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, say the legislation is too broad.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very concerned about the specter of thousands of frivolous
motions being filed by defendants who have been convicted of very
serious crimes," said Larry Brown, executive director of the
California District Attorneys Assn. "Our concern is defendants who
are without question guilty attempting to exploit the new statute."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said there is a need for judgments to be final and
they don't have the time or staff to reopen thousands of cases just
because defendants who are already out of custody say they have been
wronged. Nearly all of the convicts are guilty and are just coming
forward so they can get their convictions overturned and file
potentially lucrative civil suits, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   "Even Perez made good arrests," said James Dabney, who heads the
habeas corpus team for the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Some judges agree.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an assumption that there is a whole mass of people who
were wrongly convicted," said Assistant Supervising Criminal Judge
David S. Wesley. "I don't believe that."</TE>
<TE>   There are, however, isolated situations where people out of
custody can get their convictions overturned. In two recent cases,
Fidler dismissed the convictions after receiving a letter from Dabney
saying prosecutors did not oppose the petition for habeas corpus.</TE>
<TE>   Though Los Angeles prosecutors made an exception in those two
cases, Dabney said they don't routinely have time to study such cases
and plan to continue focusing on those where the convicts are still
behind bars. "Obviously, those are the cases we need to look at
first," Dabney said. "We are dealing with finite resources. It's also
an issue of fairness."</TE>
<TE>   Fidler declined to be interviewed for this story but said in court
that he believes prosecutors would not oppose habeas corpus if there
was a "smoking gun" to show that the person was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Fidler said that most of the cases "have been nothing but
allegations that in another case the officer lied."</TE>
<TE>   Fidler said he is abiding by a state appellate decision last year
that denied relief to Carlos Mendez, a Los Angeles man who was
convicted of drug charges and had finished serving his time. Mendez
had been arrested by then-LAPD Officer David Mack, who is serving a
prison sentence for bank robbery. The justices said Mendez failed to
show that Mack lied in his case or that his guilty plea was tainted
by Mack's own conviction, which occurred four years later.</TE>
<TE>   In the Torres case, LAPD Officers Ruben Palomares and Sonny Garcia
were working undercover on March 24, 1998, when they said he sold
them rock cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, a Guatemalan immigrant who has admitted being a street
gang member, denied selling any drugs. "I have my conscience clean
with God," he told the probation officer who evaluated him. "I know I
can't win with humans, but with God I can."</TE>
<TE>   Facing a possible state prison term, Torres pleaded no contest in
April 1998 and was sentenced to one year in county jail. "I had to
take a deal because I didn't want to go to prison," he said in an
interview. "If I went to trial, I would have lost. [Jurors] weren't
going to believe me."</TE>
<TE>   He has not been rearrested since. However, because he is a
convicted felon, Torres said, he cannot become a permanent resident
or receive public assistance. He also fears being deported.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that's right," said Torres, who was later paralyzed
in a drive-by shooting. "It makes me feel mad and sad because I
already did time for some stuff I didn't even do."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Manaster said the judge should dismiss
Torres' conviction because it was based on a false police report and
fabricated evidence and the officers were unreliable and dishonest.
Manaster said he believes that if the officers' pattern of misconduct
were known at the time, it would have changed the outcome of the
case.</TE>
<TE>   "If an officer is facing charges himself for dealing a ton of
cocaine and he is arresting your client for the sale of a $10 rock,
most jurors would be affected, and it would tend to decrease the
credibility of the officer," Manaster said.</TE>
<TE>   Palomares pleaded guilty in March to federal cocaine-trafficking
charges and is under investigation for a Huntington Park murder, an
on-duty police shooting and a string of home-invasion robberies.
Garcia was reprimanded for accidentally shooting at a suspect and
suspended for 110 days for maintaining a personal relationship with a
convicted felon and for improperly using an LAPD computer for
personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Rafael Perez told investigators that Palomares told
him that he and a partner shot an unarmed man and planted a gun on
him to cover it up. He also said Palomares filed false drug charges
against suspected gang members, according to court papers. Perez said
Garcia falsified police reports and accidentally fired his gun
because he "wasn't using good tactics" and had his finger on the
trigger while he was chasing a man.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Gigi Gordon, who was appointed by the Los Angeles
County Superior Court to represent people allegedly victimized by
police corruption, said it's extremely frustrating to tell her
clients who are out of custody that there is nothing she can do for
them.</TE>
<TE>   She has filed only one such petition, in the case of Alan Hector
Arredondo, who pleaded no contest in January 1996 to a charge of
possessing an assault weapon. Gordon detailed in court papers the
alleged misconduct of the involved officers and wrote that Perez told
investigators he believed the gun was planted and the arrest report
was fabricated.</TE>
<TE>   Fidler has not ruled on the Arredondo case, and Gordon is not
optimistic. Prosecutors opposed the petition.</TE>
<TE>   "I have made every effort under the sun to get the district
attorney's office to make an exception in these circumstances,"
Gordon said. "I think it's unreasonable when their own investigation
took as long as it did. The purpose of debriefing Rafael Perez was to
find out what happened. If we now know what happened, we should be
able to do something about it."</TE>

<HD>2 Hotels Are Planned for Newbury Park</HD>
<DH>Development: Both target business travelers visiting
companies along the Ventura Freeway corridor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to profit from the growth of large companies along the Ventura
Freeway corridor such as Amgen, Baxter BioScience and WellPoint
Health Networks, a Conejo Valley developer is moving forward with
plans to place two hotels for business travelers in Newbury Park.</LD>
<LD>   Robert D. Selleck, president of Selleck Properties, intends to
start razing the aging Newbury Park Center on Newbury Road at Giant
Oaks Avenue by late this year and replace it with a $23-million
project called The Terrace. The complex will include a restaurant,
retail space, a 101-room Extended StayAmerica hotel and possibly a
120-room Courtyard by Marriott.</LD>
<LD>   "What they're really going after is the business client who is
making extended trips," the Westlake Village developer said. "There
aren't a lot of locations of this quality--right off the freeway and
this close to expanding businesses."</LD>
<TE>   The hotels would be built by the companies themselves, while
Selleck coordinates overall construction and erects a two-story,
32,000-square-foot retail building. The retail portion and at least
one hotel could open by late 2003, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott's 130-room Courtyard in Camarillo has meeting space, fax
and copying services, and rooms with a work desk and two phones with
dataports for computer hookups. Courtyard rates average $80 to $120.
A Marriott spokesman said the Newbury Park site has not received
final company approval, "but we're looking forward to working with
Mr. Selleck."</TE>
<TE>   Extended StayAmerica, with 50 hotels in the state, has rooms that
include a full-size refrigerator, stove, microwave and a recliner.
Although prices haven't been set, rates at the company's Woodland
Hills hotel average $79 per night or $409 for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Prospective customers, which use hotels such as Hyatt Westlake
Plaza or Westlake Inn for visiting executives and workers, say the
planned hotels should not lack for guests.</TE>
<TE>   "It will fill a need that's not being met," said Jeff Richardson,
a spokesman for Newbury Park-based Amgen, which had thousands of
employees scattered throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Europe
and Asia before it completed a nearly $15-billion acquisition of
rival Immunex Inc. last week. "From time to time, we have difficulty
even finding a hotel room, not to mention an extended-stay situation.
Sometimes we've had to put people up as far away as Agoura Hills."</TE>
<TE>   After recently relocating its global headquarters to Westlake
Village, Baxter BioScience--with offices in Belgium, the Czech
Republic, Italy, Switzerland and Vienna--expects its visiting
employees to patronize the hotels once they open, spokeswoman Tali
Kaplan said.</TE>
<TE>   And as WellPoint Health Networks, parent company of Blue Cross of
California, becomes more of a national headquarters for its health
plans in Georgia, Missouri and Texas, there is expected to be greater
use of such lodging. "There will definitely be an increased need,"
spokesman Ken Ferber said.</TE>
<TE>   Newbury Park is an excellent location for the hotels, said Alan X.
Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, a Costa Mesa-based hotel
broker and consulting firm. Reay said most hotels built last year in
California carry either the Marriott or Hilton marquee and that
Extended StayAmerica has become the nation's fastest-growing chain of
limited-service hotels for budget-conscious travelers.</TE>
<TE>   The Terrace's hotels will be on the south half of the nearly
10-acre property and shielded from freeway traffic by the retail
building, which Selleck said should have space to accommodate several
of the center's existing tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Pauline Beck, whose family owns Newbury Park Meat Market, said the
market has become a local landmark after three decades and hopes to
stay at the center after the much-needed renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "The center needs help," Beck said, "there's no getting around
that."</TE>

<LD>It's a scene Jag Saikumar is unlikely to forget. During a sunset
stroll at an Irvine park, a coyote rushed from the bushes and
attacked his 3-year-old son, Kaushik.</LD>
<LD>   "He just charged. I barely saw him out of the corner of my eye,"
Saikumar said.</LD>
<LD>   The animal snapped at the boy's right knee, the force from the
charge knocking the child to the ground. It then lunged for the boy's
neck. "I was screaming, 'Get out! Get out! Leave him alone!'"
Saikumar recalled.</LD>
<TE>   He yanked a slipper from his foot and threw it at the coyote,
which snatched it and began chewing. "That was the window I needed,
and I yelled to my son, 'Run, baby, run!'"</TE>
<TE>   The boy ran into his father's arms; they backed away from the
coyote. Police, responding to Saikumar's cell phone call, shot and
killed the animal. His son was treated for puncture wounds and had to
endure a series of rabies shots. "I will never underestimate a wild
animal again," Saikumar said.</TE>
<TE>   Though still rare, coyote attacks like the one on Kaushik Saikumar
last year have increased alarmingly in Southern California's urban
fringes, wildlife experts say. More common are coyote sightings or
calls from frantic pet owners telling animal control officers a
coyote attacked their cat or small dog.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the state Department of Fish and Game recorded 17
coyote attacks on people in its vast southern region. Eight, like
that on Saikumar's son, resulted in injuries requiring
hospitalization. In 2000, there were only three attacks.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there had been no reported attacks until May 11. A man
walking an 80-pound dog in the canyons in the Hollywood Hills was
stalked and then chased by five coyotes, said Mervin Hee, Fish and
Game patrol chief for the southern region, which includes Santa
Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. The man
was not injured in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the things that happened last year happened after coyote
pups were coming out of the den with the mother in late spring. She's
desperately hungry and in need of protein. It seems we're going
through that same pattern again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hee said he would like to hire more wardens, but with the state
budget deficit, his resources are limited. Instead, starting next
month, Fish and Game will recruit volunteers, first in San Diego,
then in Orange County and north to Ventura, to receive a crash course
in coyote behavior--essentially Coyote 101. The volunteers will share
what they learn with the public at town hall meetings, homeowners
associations, community centers and even door to door.</TE>
<TE>   Without realizing it, Hee said, people have created a welcome
environment for the scavenging coyote: pet food left outdoors; full
trash cans left uncovered; people feeding wild animals; pets allowed
to roam freely at night; landscaping that offers excellent cover. In
short, people have created a better habitat for coyotes than nature
has, Hee said. This year's drought is expect to compound the problem.
The lack of rain has pushed small rodents and other prey into
residential areas, where they find vegetation and other food sources.
Right behind is the coyote.</TE>
<TE>   "The wild lands can't support them," said Doug Updike, a senior
wildlife biologist for Fish and Game. "The coyotes ... are faced with
a choice: They can move or die."</TE>
<TE>   And since coyotes are nothing if not adaptable, they move. In
recent months, coyotes have been sighted as far west as Huntington
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Wile E. Coyote is named that way for a reason," Updike said.</TE>
<TE>   "Coyotes are smart, very smart," agreed Rick Parmer, a Fish and
Game supervising naturalist for the central coast region in Napa.</TE>
<TE>   Which means that to change the behavior of urban coyotes, people
have to change their own behavior. Killing a nuisance coyote is not
the answer because it will just be replaced by another coyote, Hee
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though no one has done surveys, Hee said, experts believe that "we
have more coyotes in the urban area than in the wild. Look around
you. There are ample food sources, water, everything they need. The
food sources are here because we're careless."</TE>
<TE>   The increasing number of conflicts prompted Fish and Game to issue
a statewide warning last week alerting people to the dangers of
coyotes in urban areas and explaining how to deal with them. Among
the more dramatic attacks in 2001 recorded by Fish and Game:</TE>
<TE>   * Dec. 15--A San Gabriel father and his 3-year-old daughter were
leaving their home. As the father turned back toward the frontdoor, a
coyote grabbed the child by the shoulder and head and pulled her out
to the street. The child suffered minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   * Oct. 2--Three children were attacked while on lunch break at a
San Clemente elementary school. One child was bitten on the back of
the head, another was scratched on the back and arm, and the third
was knocked to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   * June 22--A 7-year-old girl and her younger brother were playing
about 7 p.m. in the backyard of a Northridge home when a coyote
entered the yard and attacked the girl. The coyote released the girl
after being hit on the head with a chair.</TE>
<TE>   * April 23--A Pomona woman was working in her backyard when a
coyote attacked her dog. She grabbed an ax handle and hit the coyote
four or five times to rescue her pet. She was scratched by the coyote
in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Wardens say coyotes that find their way into neighborhoods need
their behavior altered, not reinforced. "Make loud noises, spray them
with water. We've looked at novel ideas, from shooting them with
paint-ball guns to rubber bullets," Parmer said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that coyotes have become more aggressive, but they've
learned that humans in an urban or suburban setting do not pose a
threat to them. "In the wild, when a coyote sees a human, they take
off. But coyotes are very adaptable," said Lt. Angel Raton, a Fish
and Game warden based in Orange County. "They learn that most humans
are not a threat and learn to tolerate humans. Here, they don't have
that fear."</TE>
<TE>   Trapping and relocating urban coyotes away from suburbia isn't the
answer, Hee said. "You can't relocate them because you're just
relocating a problem. You can't take them off to the desert or wilds
because they won't be able to hunt, because they're pack animals and
a new pack won't accept the new member."</TE>
<TE>   Once a coyote has attacked someone, it is hunted and killed either
by police or by Fish and Game officials. Sometimes, the animals are
trapped and killed. Coyotes are not a protected species and can be
destroyed by Fish and Game wardens merely for displaying aggressive
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Updike, the Fish and Game biologist, said he believes that the
incursion problem may worsen before it gets better.</TE>
<TE>   "It may take a good rainy season combined with changing our
behavior," he said. "Even one dog's pet dish left outdoors could mean
the difference with one coyote surviving in an urban area or not."</TE>

<TE>   But change can be difficult to stick with, said Lisa Newell, the
mother of 9-year-old Allison, 9, who was bitten in the back of her
head during an attacks last year at Truman Benedict Elementary School
in San Clemente. Shortly after, the attacks, wildlife specialists
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture killed four coyotes believed
responsible for the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, we had loads of parents walking their kids to school.
We even had lots of parents patrolling the perimeter. But not
anymore," Newell said.</TE>
<TE>   The school may be one of the few in Orange County, if not the only
one, in Orange County, where children now have a wild animal drill,
just like a fire drill, said Principal Charlotte Hibsch. "We learned
a lot about coyotes after the attack," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Hibsch gets on the school's public address system and
announces a drill, students enter the nearest classroom and shut the
doors. They learn that if they can't find shelter, they're to keep an
eye on the animal while walking backward to safety. They are told to
never run or taunt a wild animal.</TE>
<TE>   Any sign of a coyote is reported to authorities. Students also
take home fliers warning of the dangers of coyotes and offering tips
to prevent their incursion into neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The Newells live in a new development that until this year was
adjacent to open wild land in east San Clemente. Wildlife is still
abundant. Last week, a raccoon was discovered in a tree at the
elementary school and a bobcat walked through Newell's backyard.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the coyote that gets the most respect. "I know now that
when someone sees a coyote to be cautious. They travel in packs," she
said.</TE>

<HD>Officers Create a Doggie Haven for Stray Pooches</HD>
<DH>Rescue: Abused animals find compassion in the ranks of the
LAPD's Southeast Division. Some workers spend hundreds on sick pups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hannu Tarjamo knows all about dog day afternoons--dusky "p.m. shifts"
when a cop has to pack more than his 9-millimeter Beretta. He has to
bring out the Milk-Bones.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the 30-year-old LAPD officer has rescued dogs in
Southeast Los Angeles--angry dogs, abandoned dogs, abused dogs,
dozens of them.</LD>
<LD>   Tarjamo is one of several police officers who have made the
Southeast Division in Watts a kind of doggie haven. From dewy-eyed
puppies to street-smart old dogs who obey traffic signals better than
many humans, all manner of pooch has come through Southeast.</LD>
<TE>   "I've taken a bunch of pit bulls in my car," said Tarjamo, a
clean-cut, youthful-looking officer with the accent of his native
Finland. "A lot of times, the dogs are scared of you because they've
been abused so much. But when they know you want to help them--when
you pet them--they're so overcome with joy. They can't believe
they're getting something positive from a person."</TE>
<TE>   If helping dogs has been accepted at Southeast--and can survive
bad puns or references to Tarjamo's patrol car as the
"dogmobile"--it's in large part due to one person.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Officer Sandra Magdaleno has by all accounts taken more
than 200 dogs off the streets. Working in one of the city's busiest,
most violent areas, the 51-year-old Magdaleno certainly didn't set
out to rescue dogs when she joined the force 19 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But stray dogs were everywhere. In fact, South Los Angeles has the
busiest animal shelter in the city, if not the entire country, said
Jackie David, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of Animal
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Most were simply scared, starved, diseased. Many were puppies, as
Magdaleno saw it, "babies being allowed to run across the street."</TE>
<TE>   The abuse heaped on some dogs was jolting.</TE>
<TE>   A teenager was arrested a few months ago after sticking an M-80
explosive in a dog's mouth, blowing off its lower jaw. Magdaleno saw
countless dogs dragging their partially paralyzed bodies for days
after accidents. "Bait dogs''--usually strays used as practice
opponents for fighting pit bulls--roamed shellshocked, torn and
bloodied. Some dogs have been found incinerated, tied to discarded
Christmas trees that have been set ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   Magdaleno remembers one absurd encounter with dog cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   She had stopped a motorist for a traffic violation and discovered
he didn't have a driver's license. "I'm going to have to impound your
car," she told him. Exasperated, he blurted out, "Well, can I at
least take my dog out of the trunk?"</TE>
<TE>   She also recalls one particular rescue, 10 years ago, on Lanzit
Avenue and San Pedro Street. For about a month, Magdaleno had been
leaving kibble for two puppies who lived under a trash bin.</TE>
<TE>   One day it rained so hard, the officer thought the pups could
drown. But she couldn't check on them until the end of her shift.</TE>
<TE>   When she did, she found only one puppy, hiding near a parked car.
After it saw Magdaleno, it dashed under the dumpster. But Magdaleno
was waiting on the other side when it popped out.</TE>
<TE>   "There was the puppy swimming toward the curb. It was my chance. I
grabbed it by the back of the fur," Magdaleno said. "It was so
scared. I put it in the back of the car, and the poor little puppy
just dug its nose into the edge of the cushion."</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy work.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these dogs stink. Some get nervous in the car and poop
and pee. You don't just grab, take them and you're done," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Magdaleno is no longer on patrol duty, but officers bring her
dogs, which she sometimes stashes in an equipment room that
informally serves as the division kennel.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of officers have taken animals home. Sometimes they start
calling friends, mothers ... trying to get them adopted," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Benny Abucejo was in the market for a dog two months ago
when he stopped by the equipment room. As it happened, Magdaleno had
a 2-month-old grayish-black mutt in need of a home. He had been
digging through trash earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell he was malnourished, but he was a good-looking
dog, a playful kind of dog," Abucejo said of the puppy his nephews
and nieces dubbed Charcoal. "They love him. He's perfect for my
nephews and nieces to play with."</TE>
<TE>   Although some police officers go out of their way to place dogs in
shelters that won't euthanize them, the reality is that many dogs are
in such horrible shape that hopes of being adopted, and surviving,
are slim.</TE>
<TE>   At least 30 police officers at the Southeast station own dogs that
were plucked from the surrounding streets.</TE>
<TE>   Some officers carry dog food or water dishes in their cars.
"Standard equipment," said Officer Catherine Sobieski.</TE>
<TE>   Officers have spent hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, caring
for dogs. Magdaleno once paid $600 for treatment of a mutt with
really bad mange.</TE>
<TE>   The police officer-dog connection isn't unique to the Southeast
Division. Taking strays off the streets is fairly common at many
police stations, particularly in South L.A., part of the San Fernando
Valley and the Eastside</TE>
<TE>   Officer Kristi Nielsen found her black pit bull Gracey late last
year inside a home where a man had been found murdered.</TE>
<TE>   "It may have belonged to that man. It belongs to my stepdaughter
now," Nielsen, 38, said of the then 2-month-old pup she found
whimpering in an upstairs room.</TE>
<TE>   The pup slept in her police cruiser all day as the homicide
investigation stretched on.</TE>
<TE>   For Officer Sobieski, there's another reason for tackling the
problem of discarded and abused dogs. She remembers something she
once heard.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told that in many families where you have habitual child
abuse, you'll find neglected and abused animals. So if your neighbors
have abused dogs, keep an eye on their children. See if they have
bruises," Sobieski said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if a cop ever dreams of cultivating a persona like "NYPD
Blue's" crusty Det. Andy Sipowicz, rescuing dogs doesn't exactly
help.</TE>
<TE>   "You're teased about it. Especially if you're a guy. I think
that's what holds a lot of the men back," Magdaleno said. "You're
supposed to be macho and all that good stuff, and here you're picking
up a mangy mutt and wanting to protect it."</TE>
<TE>   And the puppy Magdaleno rescued on that rainy day near the
dumpster?</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later she still has the cocker spaniel mix, a dog her
children named Pretzel for reasons that elude her.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling how the frightened pup stuck its nose into the car seat
as if to hide, Magdaleno remembers thinking:</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to show this puppy what a good life is like."</TE>

pet them--they're so overcome with joy," says Officer Hannu Tarjamo,

<DH>Tour: Design Walk celebrates the new interest some are
showing in downtown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David and Lisa Trulli call themselves born-again urbanists, drawn to
the architecture, diversity and energy of city life. So downtown Los
Angeles, which some say is going through its own rebirth, seems like
a perfect fit for the couple.</LD>
<LD>   "As more of our friends are having babies and taking the
soccer-mom route, we're kind of not relating anymore," said David
Trulli, a 41-year-old cinematographer. "We come down here, and we
feel like we're more in our tribe."</LD>
<LD>   The Trullis spent Saturday touring chic artists' lofts during the
first Design Walk, an event to highlight redevelopment in part of the
city's urban core.</LD>
<TE>   The event, sponsored by L.A. Architect magazine, attracted
tourists, architects, developers and city officials to the Historic
District to participate in activities as varied as the area.
Throughout the afternoon, visitors listened to bands at a block
party, took downtown bus tours and participated in panel discussions
on growth in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of wanted to celebrate what's going on down here," said
Jerry Levi, marketing director for the magazine. "And it hit a
nerve."</TE>
<TE>   During the last few years, the Historic District has been
transformed from a sparse industrial area and home to empty old
office buildings into what Levi called a trendy residential
neighborhood. Commercial buildings have been converted into studios.
Coffeehouses and furniture stores have opened, and the Architecture
and Design Museum has moved into the Bradbury Building. But the
biggest change, residents say, is the arrival of the Southern
California Institute of Architecture, which took over the converted
freight depot along Santa Fe Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "That's kind of the cornerstone of the neighborhood," said Leslie
Tamaribuchi, former managing director of a theater company on
Traction Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Tamaribuchi said that neighborhood--centered east of Main Street
between 1st and 4th streets--is trying to attract residents and
businesses and change its perception as an edgy, dirty or spooky
place. There are street people who live near some of the warehouses,
she said, but there are street people in Beverly Hills too.</TE>
<TE>   The renovation is also extending north and west, where a
spruced-up City Hall recently reopened and the Walt Disney Concert
Hall and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels are under
construction.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Jan Perry, who participated in a discussion
Saturday about the future of downtown, said she believes the city is
finally taking notice of the area and putting some resources into its
growth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to say this is the place to come to live and work," she
told a crowd of about 150. "This is the place to buy historic
buildings and refurbish them. And this is the area for new
development."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Joey Shimoda moved into a live/work space on Traction
Avenue less than two years ago and opened his home for the event. As
visitors wandered through his spacious loft, Shimoda said downtown
isn't typical of Los Angeles. There are no views, no nearby
supermarkets and no places to take animals, he said. Oh, and he
doesn't have heating or cooling.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that, it's perfect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of conveniences is what discourages some potential
residents from moving into the area.</TE>
<TE>   John Glance, 38, of Santa Ana said he loves the idea of working
and living in one space and being surrounded by others doing the
same.</TE>
<TE>   But with a 7-year-old son, Glance said it would be difficult to
live somewhere so industrial. "I may have been too suburbanized," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes to the neighborhood have not been greeted with
enthusiasm by everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Lili Lakich, an artist who has owned a 5,000-square-foot studio in
the area for more than two decades, said the gentrification of
downtown is pushing rents up and making it impossible for many
artists to live there. Lakich said stockbrokers and professionals are
the ones moving into her neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists are dying to buy here," she said. "But they can't afford
it and they can't get loans."</TE>

<HD>A Medical Supplier Without Borders</HD>
<DH>With only a modest budget, Direct Relief shipped $81.5
million in drugs and equipment to 60 poor nations last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>SANTA BARBARA -- Most international relief organizations subscribe to
the adage that if you give a man a fish, you feed him once, but if
you teach him to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   Direct Relief International subscribes to a different theory: No
matter how well you train someone to fish, he still needs a pole,
bait and something to catch.</LD>
<LD>   In the realm of international medicine, that means supplying
trained doctors and clinicians in the world's backwaters with the
rudimentary materials they need to diagnose and treat common
diseases.</LD>
<TE>   "The thing is to keep the health professionals productively
engaged, but also to directly help those [patients] who need it,"
said Thomas Tighe, president of the 54-year-old nonprofit
organization based in a 36,000-square-foot warehouse at Santa Barbara
Municipal Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a necessary complement to training people and giving them
the skills to provide health services, and not have them be
enormously frustrated because they can't do their job."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Direct Relief shipped 951,000 pounds of donated medical
supplies and equipment--valued at $81.5 million--to more than 500
hospitals, clinics and doctors offices in some 60 Third World
countries. While admitting that a full tally is impossible, the
organization estimates that last year it helped more than 10 million
people.</TE>
<TE>   And, like an ant that can carry up to 20 times its own weight, the
charity did it with a budget of $2.1 million, 17 full-time and eight
part-time workers, and an army of more than 400 volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Projects range from finding and shipping 30 wheelchairs to a
facility for disabled boys in Accra, Ghana, to sending
patient-monitoring devices to a regional hospital overwhelmed after
earthquakes destroyed all the other medical facilities in northwest
Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Direct Relief's current challenges--such as the wheelchair
project--can be found scrawled in erasable marker on white board
hanging in its warehouse headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Seven projects are detailed in red ink, which means a reliable
recipient is in place somewhere in the world, the medical materials
have been donated and money has been found to ship out everything
from drugs to rudimentary operating tables.</TE>
<TE>   Another 14 projects are in blue ink, indicating approved projects
for which the organization is trying to find materials and the money
to truck the supplies to the Port of Long Beach and ship them
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the projects send supplies to generally safe
parts of the world, others involve war zones. As Israeli tanks were
rolling, Direct Relief was preparing to ship medical supplies,
including eyeglasses, to a medical facility in a Palestinian section
of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   And in the months prior to the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan, Direct
Relief supplied three medical facilities in Kabul with a wide range
of material. After war broke out, it shifted its focus to border
refugee camps, sending medicine and basic medical equipment. Now it
is eyeing new aid to Kabul doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Direct Relief's role in Afghanistan went largely unnoticed in the
United States, although Tighe said the headquarters fielded one
anonymous call.</TE>
<TE>   "There were several folks on the line, young men, and they were
profanely criticizing our assistance to Afghanistan," Tighe said.
"There wasn't a direct threat, but it was unsettling."</TE>
<TE>   Tighe also found the call frustrating: Direct Relief steers away
from political stances, directing its aid to places where it is
needed, and where it can verify that the material will aid civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to be ethical and nondiscriminatory in who they
service, have a good reputation and are trained," Tighe said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the work is focused overseas. Direct Relief is part of a
regional response system in the event of disasters such as
earthquakes, and is in the process of establishing a regional
emergency repository of medicines, to be donated by Johnson &amp;
Johnson, one of its largest supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Direct Relief also has sponsored dental clinics for local
low-income families through the USC-UCLA mobile dental clinic.</TE>
<TE>   But the vast majority of its work is foreign, a pattern
established in 1945 when William Zimdin, an Estonian immigrant, began
shipping food, clothing and medicines to help his homeland rebuild
after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, the efforts were formalized in the William Zimdin
Foundation, which became Direct Relief Foundation in 1957 under Dezso
Karczag, a Hungarian immigrant who took over after Zimdin's death in
1951. The current name was adopted in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Tighe took over Direct Relief less than two years ago after
spending eight years in the Peace Corps, the last five as the
agency's top financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   For Tighe, who had never heard of Direct Relief until the
recruiter called, the transition has been refreshing. One key is the
shift from a bureaucracy overseeing more than 7,000 Peace Corps
volunteers to a small organization with a narrow but significant
focus.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a strong sense that their heart was in the right place," he
said. "This is private people and private business doing something
altruistic for no other reason than what it purports to be."</TE>

<HD>Picking a Fight Over Migrant Farm Labor</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Supporters say guest worker program puts
needed manpower in California fields. Foes contend the system is ripe
for abuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a novel experiment in California agriculture, this
controversial plan by Ventura County labor contractor Ralph De Leon
to import Mexican laborers to pick lemons near Somis.</LD>
<LD>   Tapping a federal program, the veteran Santa Paula labor broker
employed 38 guest workers for two months earlier this year, picking
them up at the border and putting them to work in the county's citrus
heartland.</LD>
<LD>   He provided housing, three meals a day and transportation to and
from the lemon groves. And when their contract was up on April 19, he
put them on a bus and sent them back to Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   De Leon said he lost $3,000 in the deal, believed to be the first
large-scale use of the guest worker program in California
agriculture. But he said he would do it again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to provide an option to those workers who are risking
their lives crossing the border and who come here only to live in
deplorable conditions," said De Leon, adding that he was forced to
recruit foreign help after he was unable to find enough domestic
pickers--at least enough here legally--for the citrus harvest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an underground economy that everybody is ignoring," he said.
"There are so many pluses [with the guest worker program], I just
can't understand why anyone would oppose it."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents are lining up to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   While growers support the need for an expanded and more efficient
guest worker program, farm worker advocates say the system is
unnecessary and ripe for abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The program, established under the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986, allows agricultural producers to temporarily tap foreign
workers when domestic laborers are unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   California growers say that is increasingly the case, as legal
immigrants leave the fields for more stable jobs and the statewide
farm labor force--500,000 workers at peak season--swells with illegal
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, at least half and as much as 70% of the state's
farm labor force is undocumented. Rather than criminalizing a system
of migratory labor vital to the farm economy, growers say it should
be brought into the open and regulated to eliminate abuse and
minimize the risks migrants take to get here.</TE>
<TE>   Critics Say There's Plenty of Local Labor</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the program say such arguments are a smokescreen for
efforts to supply agriculture with a steady and disposable low-wage
work force.</TE>
<TE>   With double-digit unemployment in the Central Valley and other
farming enclaves, labor advocates and others argue that there are
more than enough domestic pickers to work the fields.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they say the surest way for agricultural employers to
maintain the work force they need is to raise wages. And if the
concern is that too many farm workers are undocumented, they suggest
the answer is to legalize the immigrant work force already living in
this country.</TE>
<TE>   "If growers are truthful, they will admit that there are plenty of
people here to do the work if you include the undocumented," said
Marc Grossman, spokesman for the United Farm Workers union.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is genuine legalization, then the guest worker program
becomes irrelevant," he added. "Until then, we will do everything
possible to continue to fight for California farm workers who deserve
the opportunity to work."</TE>
<TE>   About 45,000 foreign farm workers are admitted to the United
States each year through the federal guest worker program. Most are
in the Southeast, in the sugar cane fields in Florida and tobacco
farms in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Neither federal nor state labor officials could say how many
agricultural guest workers come to California each year. But
officials believe it is no more than a few hundred, with most brought
in to tend livestock on sheep ranches.</TE>
<TE>   Jack King, manager of national affairs for the California Farm
Bureau, said growers statewide have been watching De Leon's efforts
as they grapple with their own labor shortages.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, De Leon is due to talk about his experiences with the
program during a farm bureau meeting on labor issues in June.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: People on both sides of the issue believe De
Leon's trial run could be the start of widespread use of the program
in California.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question, especially with [post-Sept. 11] talk of
strengthening border security, that there is growing concern that on
any given day there could be a labor shortage," said King, adding
that the farm bureau backs efforts underway to modify the program to
make it more workable for California growers.</TE>
<TE>   "We need some type of legalized process," he said, "whether it's
legalization of those who are here or a [more efficient] legalized
system to bring workers into California."</TE>
<TE>   Half-Crews Used for Recent Harvests</TE>
<TE>   King and others say the labor shortage is critical. In Ventura
County, agriculture officials say it has become so bad in recent
years that many growers have been forced to go with half-crews during
citrus and avocado harvests.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the program counter that in addition to severe
unemployment in agricultural areas, many workers experience chronic
underemployment.</TE>
<TE>   "Show me a picture of crops rotting in the fields or going
unharvested because of an undersupply of workers," said Karl Lawson,
an immigrant rights advocate from Camarillo. "This is a smokescreen
designed to lower [farm worker] wages."</TE>
<TE>   Lawson said he is troubled by the agriculture industry's answer to
what he calls a phantom problem: legislation to reform the guest
worker program.</TE>
<TE>   Provisions of guest worker bills introduced in the U.S. House and
Senate would lower wages and worsen living conditions for farm
workers, Lawson contends.</TE>
<TE>   He said one provision in particular, which would allow growers and
contractors to provide a housing allowance rather than actual housing
as required under the current program, would be especially onerous in
a place like Ventura County, where skyrocketing housing prices and
soaring rents are making it tougher than ever for field workers to
find places to live.</TE>
<TE>   Those bills, plus competing measures introduced by labor
advocates, are essentially stalled as both sides attempt to reach a
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Roy, general counsel for the Ventura County Agricultural
Assn., said he believes there is room for compromise, noting that the
bills backed by growers contain provisions favored by labor advocates
to legalize workers who agree to work in agriculture for a specified
period of time.</TE>
<TE>   Roy said he wouldn't be surprised to see some movement on the
issue this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in the long run this is the best solution," he said. "It
may not be a panacea for all employers, but for certain segments I
think it is a very viable program."</TE>
<TE>   De Leon thinks so too. As required by the federal government, he
first posted the job openings at the Somis lemon ranch with state
employment offices. Just 22 people expressed interest, eight showed
up to learn more and only two of those wanted the work.</TE>
<TE>   The guest workers--who came from the states of Zacatecas,
Michoacan, Vera Cruz and Oaxaca--were guaranteed $7.56 an hour, but
De Leon said they averaged between $9 and $10 an hour working at
piece rate. Then they returned to Mexico, with De Leon picking up the
tab for transportation as required by the program.</TE>
<TE>   "No problems with Border Patrol; they didn't have to pay a coyote
to get them across," De Leon said. "I really cannot, for the love of
God, understand why anyone would oppose these people coming here safe
and legally."</TE>

<HD>Grandstanding Mayor Slim Jim Needs New Game Plan for NFL
Stadium</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As I watch the new football stadium materialize, mushrooming up from
the dreams of small-minded men, I keep thinking of the Charles
Bukowski character in "Barfly."</LD>
<LD>   Bukowski's girl goes off and sleeps with the buff bozo bartender,
and a raging Bukowski demands to know how she could do that with
somebody who stands for everything he's against.</LD>
<LD>   What are you against? She asks.</LD>
<TE>   Obviousness, Bukowski says. Unoriginal, macho sports energy.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have anything against an NFL franchise in Los Angeles, or
a new stadium, for that matter. But it's embarrassing to watch city
leaders jump on the wagon lickety-split, with no public discussion or
sophistication, as if this were some hick town desperate for the NFL
to throw us a lifeline.</TE>
<TE>   When I first referred to Mayor Hahn as Slim Jim months ago,
because there wasn't much there, I had no idea.</TE>
<TE>   One day last week he was telling me he hadn't seen a solid
proposal, the next day the would-be owners magically produced a model
of the new stadium, and the day after that Hahn was nodding like a
bobble-head Dodger doll at the press conference, throwing himself
behind the deal.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, downtown is a ridiculous place for a stadium,
because it's going to be empty as a cheerleader's head 90% of the
time, and there are a thousand better ways to re-imagine and
revitalize downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Second, wrangling the stadium into a redevelopment area by calling
the property blighted is a flat-out lie, if not a lawsuit-worthy
misuse of redevelopment money. Unless the plan is to have the stadium
double as a mental hospital, detox center and homeless shelter,
downtown L.A. is going to have the same problems it has today.</TE>
<TE>   Third, these incessant claims from Hahn and the would-be owners
about there being no risk to taxpayers are unadulterated hokum,
unless they agree to a plan I'm about to explain.</TE>
<TE>   The city says it's going to finance the land purchase with up to
$100 million in municipal bonds, but we shouldn't worry. The new
billionaire owners promise to pay it back in time with ticket taxes
and whatnot.</TE>
<TE>   What if the billionaires get hit by a bus?</TE>
<TE>   What if the team is a dud and attendance sags?</TE>
<TE>   What if the franchise up and leaves L.A., as two others did in a
span of three months?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that taxpayers could be left holding the bag, and
spending millions more to sue the billionaires. It wouldn't be the
first time a city got fleeced and was left wondering what to do with
an empty, useless eyesore of a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Ganis, a Chicago sports stadium consultant who was involved
in the departure of the Raiders and Rams from L.A., says city
officials have to insist that "a third-party insurer structure this
deal, so there's no flimflam involved and you're truly protecting the
taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   Repayment, he says, shouldn't be predicated on ticket sales or
anything else. It should be a guarantee written in stone, "almost
like a letter of credit."</TE>
<TE>   That means the deal could cost more, Ganis says. But as L.A. City
Councilman Jack Weiss keeps telling me, the city ought not to be shy
about dictating terms. The NFL needs Los Angeles and its TV market
more than L.A. needs the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Ganis, who lectures at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government on
the role of the public sector in sports facility development, said
he's surprised Los Angeles is even considering a downtown site,
particularly since football stadiums have little or no economic
impact on surrounding areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The best, most effective site for an NFL stadium in Los Angeles
is Chavez Ravine," Ganis said, and he claims it's obvious to everyone
in the sports business except the principals behind the downtown
project.</TE>
<TE>   Ganis recommends building the stadium next to Dodger Stadium, and
double-decking some of the parking lot to compensate for lost spaces.
The acreage is available. The sports theme is already established.
The access roads are already in. And the Dodgers are affiliated with
Fox, an NFL partner.</TE>
<TE>   "The deal with Fox could be worked out in a day," Ganis said with
only slight exaggeration. "You could build the stadium faster,
cheaper, with less public risk, the best potential economic return
for an NFL team, and you don't have to create this contorted
procedural mechanism to acquire the land like they're doing
downtown."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure it would be quite as easy as Ganis says. But his
arguments should have been part of a public discussion that never
took place, and we're running out of time, given the headfirst rush.</TE>
<TE>   In the span of a week, we've gone from City Hall promises that a
football stadium wasn't part of the redevelopment plan to a pom-pom
waving celebration with Slim Jim as head cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   Go team.</TE>

<HD>Disneyland Workers Await Paychecks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disneyland employees who rely on paychecks instead of direct deposits
did not get paid on time this past week because of problems with mail
delivery, Disney officials confirmed Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Some employees, who are accustomed to receiving their paychecks by
mail on Wednesday, still had not been paid by late Saturday
afternoon, even after they were told they could pick up their checks
at the theme park.</LD>
<LD>   ''I was told to come back in four to six hours and the check would
be ready,'' said a restaurant worker who declined to give her name on
Saturday. ''That was 48 hours ago and I still have not received my
check.''</LD>
<TE>   Janice Sindoni, a spokeswoman for Disney, said the number of
affected workers was small.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred workers milled around outside a Disneyland
security office between 6 p.m. and midnight Friday, waiting to get
paid. But they left empty-handed, one worker said.</TE>
<TE>   Sindoni said the checks were sent to the Anaheim post office as
usual but were not delivered.</TE>
<TE>   ''This has really messed up a lot of people,'' the restaurant
worker said. She said she had to borrow money to pay for prescription
drugs for her 7-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Female Priest Says Vows</HD>
<DH>Religion: In Newport Beach, woman from offshoot group is
ordained. She says she's been 'called' since childhood and that her
church is more inclusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Giovanna M. Piazza's dream is to sing backup with the Rolling Stones.
Her calling is to be a priest, one that she fulfilled Saturday when
she was ordained as the first Catholic woman priest in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Piazza, 40, became the third woman priest in the Diocese of
Ecumenical, Old Catholic Faith Communities, a small offshoot of the
Catholic faith, with about 300 members in the area and half a million
worldwide. Although observing the same sacraments and professing many
of the core values as the Roman Catholic Church, the congregation
diverges in its beliefs about divorce, sexual orientation, and the
exclusion of people from other denominations during Holy Communion.
It also allows married men and women to become priests.</LD>
<LD>   As members from her congregation of St. Matthew Ecumenical Church
placed the stole, a symbol of priesthood, around her shoulders,
Piazza was fulfilling her duty as well as her lifetime aspiration.</LD>
<TE>   "This is something that's beyond me," Piazza said. "I have put it
aside and walked away from it several times, but this is something
I've been called to do. This is a mantle of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   For some, Piazza's ordination is a symbol of reformation at a time
when the Catholic Church needs it most.</TE>
<TE>   Some Say the Time Is Right for Such an Event</TE>
<TE>   "It's an event that is long overdue," said Christina Buismato, 66,
a Roman Catholic who came to the ordination with a friend. "At a time
in which our church is going through so many horrible things, this is
a bright event."</TE>
<TE>   Although Buismato said she will not leave the Roman Catholic
Church, she said it's time for the church to stop treating woman as
second-class citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza's ordination was held at St. Mark Presbyterian Church in
Newport Beach so there would be room for the more than 100 people who
attended. The celebration opened with chants of joy to the beat of
drums. Piazza walked the church's aisle, applauding, a tissue in her
right hand, her eyes overflowing as she reached the altar.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony built up to the moment when Piazza lay face down on
the altar, wrapped in a white mantle as part of the ritual of
prostration.</TE>
<TE>   "I was praying, thinking about all of the responsibility that came
with the ordination," she said about the moving moment. It was
followed by the passing on of the priest's mantle, a vestment of
colorful fibers from people in the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   As a devout Roman Catholic, Piazza spent 35 years trying to find
herself in the church. She said she has felt the calling to become a
priest since she was a child. Even when she knew that it was not a
possibility under the Roman Catholic Church, she prepared herself to
pursue a religious path. She studied theology at Benedictine College
In Atchison, Kan., and earned a master's of divinity degree from Yale
University.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, she realized that her values diverged from those
of the Catholic Church, she said, and she felt compelled to leave.
She said she could not belong to a religion that excluded "so many
people," including divorced couples and homosexuals, and that did not
allow married men and women to be ordained.</TE>
<TE>   "Any one issue might not have been sufficient to take me out of
the church," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "That would have been myopic. It was a combination of all of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Reform Is Catching On, Group's Leader Says</TE>
<TE>   Piazza's ideology is catching on among Roman Catholics eager for
reform said the group's bishop, Peter Hickman.</TE>
<TE>   "The days are numbered for an exclusively male Catholic
priesthood," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And not to mention a celibate one. The Holy Spirit is talking to
the Catholic Church through us."</TE>
<TE>   Many theologians see efforts such as Piazza's ordination as a step
in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "For us to expect that this would have a great impact on the
church would be unrealistic," said Marvin Meyer, religion department
chairman at Chapman University.</TE>
<TE>   "But if the Roman Catholic Church is going to survive, this has to
be the wave of the future."</TE>
<TE>   Piazza said many changes within the Catholic Church will come
within the life spans of today's children.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't know that there were not any women priests," she said,
referring to two girls who came to hug her.</TE>
<TE>   "They will see God in women in the same way they see God in man.
That's a good thing for our society, not just for our church."</TE>

<HD>Bottom Line: Judge Didn't Condemn Hand-Burning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A courtroom can be a complicated place, full of nuances, hidden
meanings and hard-to-read signals.</LD>
<LD>   Ethnic relations in a place like Orange County can also be
complicated, offering no shortage of nuance and the need to read
between the lines.</LD>
<LD>   When a case with ethnic overtones makes news, the furor can be
intense. It requires everyone to take special care.</LD>
<TE>   That's where we find ourselves, I think, in the ongoing debate
over Judge James Perez's recent sentencing of the father who burned
his 5-year-old son's fingers over an open flame as punishment for
stealing a pack of gum.</TE>
<TE>   I wrote on the subject before going on vacation in late April. I
returned last week to a firestorm of protest from the judge's
relatives and other supporters, accusing me of misrepresenting what
he'd done. In the meantime, California Supreme Court Chief Justice
Ronald George has asked the county's presiding judge to prepare a
report about Perez--a 76-year-old retired jurist who handles
occasional cases--to determine if he should continue his part-time
duty.</TE>
<TE>   Although the case shouldn't inherently have been a culture clash,
Perez introduced that issue from the bench. And while to some the
only concern was how Perez was portrayed in the media, others who
complained about my column fear the resulting controversy might
unfairly taint public perceptions of Latino judges in general.</TE>
<TE>   I owe readers a couple of clarifications.</TE>
<TE>   My original column criticized the judge for reducing the case,
against the prosecutor's wishes, from a felony to a misdemeanor. I
also reported the judge fined the father, Guatemalan immigrant
Wellington Soto, a mere $100.</TE>
<TE>   What I didn't report--because I didn't know at the time--was that
he also got four years' probation and the family would be supervised
by county social workers. In addition, Soto would continue taking
parenting classes.</TE>
<TE>   I also didn't report--because I didn't know--that the final
sentence had been agreed to by the prosecutor who--along with the
defense attorney--presented it to Perez as a plea bargain they'd
reached.</TE>
<TE>   In short, I left the erroneous impression that Perez, on his own,
reduced the episode to a $100 fine.</TE>
<TE>   It was a mistake I correct now.</TE>
<TE>   However, the judge's supporters insist those facts absolve him
from criticism.</TE>
<TE>   They chastised me, properly, for not having read the transcript of
the court proceeding and challenged me to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Now I have. It definitely is relevant that the sentence was more
than a small fine, and that the deputy district attorney agreed to
the plea bargain, however unhappy she was that the judge reduced the
case to a misdemeanor. But I still question his handling of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Perez did knock it down from a felony. The record shows the
father's action caused three fingers of the boy's hands to be burned
badly enough to blister and require bandaging for several days.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging the injury, he said: "I can't argue with you that
this [Soto's action] is not probably what should have been done, but
we find ourselves in the cross-current of customs and habits. I dare
say that what Mr. Soto was doing was of a corrective nature, even
though I think if he sat back and thought about what he did he might
have taken a different approach...."</TE>
<TE>   The judge added: "I can't conceive of this being anything heavier
than a misdemeanor-type sentence, if there is one."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Schatzle argued on at least four
occasions during the hearing that the case should be treated as a
felony. "Clearly, it's within the court's discretion [to reduce the
case to a misdemeanor]," she said at one point. "I am just in
complete disagreement with the rationale that is being imposed."</TE>
<TE>   Later, toward the end of the proceedings, she asks, "At what point
does the burning of a child's hand become a felony?"</TE>
<TE>   Perez replies: "If we had prior indications of abuse of the child,
maybe it would weigh heavy in the court's mind. It seems like sort of
an isolated incident, with a purpose, in a sense that maybe it will
keep Junior from being one of our customers downstream. And I think
that's where the defendant was coming from, trying to correct a
problem that might become serious at a later time."</TE>
<TE>   Do you hear any condemnation in those words of a father holding a
child's hand over a flame? I don't, and that's where my continuing
gripe with the judge's decision rests. In fact, he elaborates on his
thinking by saying, "I dare say we've done two things [today].
Hopefully, the child has learned a lesson, and hopefully Senior has
learned a lesson."</TE>
<TE>   Far from expressing outrage, the judge is saying perhaps the
hand-burning will turn out for the best.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters argue that probation and Social Service
intervention are significant punishments.</TE>
<TE>   Among the judge's defenders is longtime attorney Alfredo Amezcua.
"I'm just concerned about someone who has had an illustrious career
and been an exemplary judge in Orange County, from the Latino
community, who is being judged by the press without knowing all the
facts," Amezcua says.</TE>
<TE>   Such critiques of Latinos run the risk "of bringing out the
redneck people who say, 'Those Mexicans shouldn't be here,'" he said.
"It just adds to the craziness of our community."</TE>
<TE>   Amezcua asks why Perez was singled out. I reminded him I've
criticized various judges over the years, of all ethnic stripes.</TE>
<TE>   I should have been more thorough in my original column.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't change Perez's words in court that day.</TE>
<TE>   When his supporters acknowledge that the judge's own words and
decisions defined this case, then we'll have edged closer to an
honest debate over what happened to Mr. Soto.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oxnard Planning Commission has again postponed its review of an
environmental impact report for the city's proposed $750-million
RiverPark development, until June 20.</LD>
<LD>   The RiverPark development, at the junction of the Ventura Freeway
and the Pacific Coast Highway, would become the largest mixed-use
project in Ventura County history.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by a $12-billion pension investment fund, a Los Angeles
builder and the county's top real estate deal maker, the plan
includes about 2,800 housing units, a town square, movie theater,
restaurants, hotel and convention center, three schools, sports
fields and a food-and-wine exposition. Commercial space would total
2.5 million square feet in 30 buildings.</LD>
<TE>   The second postponement came after RiverPark officials asked the
Planning Commission for more time to prepare.</TE>

<HD>Secret Service Job Fair Attracts the Serious, Curious</HD>
<DH>Careers: Potential candidates learn what it takes to
protect the president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A financial analyst, a police officer, a political science major and
a teenager who is a movie aficionado were among those who turned out
for a Secret Service job fair Saturday morning in downtown Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "We attract a lot of characters because this is a high-profile job
and because of who we protect," said Special Agent Brian Hunter, who
works in the agency's Los Angeles office.</LD>
<LD>   By 1 p.m., more than 50 people had visited the job fair, which ran
until 5 p.m. Potential candidates learned about jobs as special
agents, uniformed officers or in the technical division.</LD>
<TE>   Often, the mystique of the job allures applicants--some of whom
are serious, and others who are simply intrigued, said Special Agent
Faron Paramore.</TE>
<TE>   It may be the idea of guarding President Bush as he leads the war
against terrorism or meets with high-profile people such as Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in the White House. Or it may be the
thought of wearing those really cool shades.</TE>
<TE>   For whatever reason, the job fair attracted Jason DiPaolo, 27, a
political science major with a military background and a shaved head,
and Wendy Keller, 31, a financial analyst with a degree in music. It
also attracted 14-year-old Daniel Brown, a ninth-grader who loves the
movie "Air Force One."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel learned about the job fair while browsing the Internet
recently. His father, mother and younger sister all came along from
Victorville, more than two hours away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice that at 14 he stays focused," his mother, Evelyn, said
of Daniel, who wants to work in law enforcement or produce movies.</TE>
<TE>   So what does it take to be allowed to stand next to the president
or the pope with a loaded gun?</TE>
<TE>   Consideration is given to those who are U.S. citizens who are 21
to 36 years old and have good eyesight. Applicants must complete a
polygraph test, medical examination, drug screening and background
check. They also must go through a series of interviews, tests and
training.</TE>
<TE>   Secret Service agents usually need a four-year college degree. And
it takes at least four years on the job before an agent is allowed to
guard the president. Before that, agents gain experience by
protecting former presidents and other dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to be a cameraman," said Special Agent Marcus Snipe, who
has been with the Secret Service for 12 years. "I knew nothing about
law enforcement before I came to the Secret Service."</TE>
<TE>   Snipe was recruited in the 1980s while working for a television
station in Atlanta. He was following former Democratic presidential
candidate Bruce Babbitt when Secret Service agents convinced him to
apply.</TE>
<TE>   It's an exciting life, said Snipe, who was guarding the president
in Florida on Sept. 11, when terrorists attacked the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "You literally witness history happening every day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he agreed that there is a mystique surrounding the job. For
example, he said, people always wonder, "What are they listening to
in their earpiece?"</TE>

<HD>Davis Budget Proposal Sets Stage for Fight Over Taxes</HD>
<DH>Spending: Governor's call for hike in vehicle license fees
and cigarette levy draws criticism from motorists, smokers and tax
watchdogs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' call for tax hikes to help close a $23.6-billion
budget hole has not only set the stage for a partisan fight over the
state's next spending plan, it has also opened him to criticism from
motorists, smokers and tax watchdogs.</LD>
<LD>   Davis has proposed essentially doubling for one year the vehicle
license fees paid by motorists and increasing state taxes paid on
cigarettes by 50 cents a pack. The proposal is part of a
shortfall-reduction plan that also includes deep spending cuts,
particularly in health-care programs, along with borrowing and budget
transfers.</LD>
<LD>   The tax portion of the plan accounts for about $1.8 billion of the
$23.6-billion shortfall--$1.3 billion from the higher vehicle fees
and $475 million from cigarettes. Davis, who promised in January not
to seek a tax increase, said last week that both proposals were a
last resort and necessary to preserve funding for public schools and
other critical needs.</LD>
<TE>   Critics, including some hit directly by the proposals, say the
higher taxes are unfair, excessive or regressive, meaning that they
hit poor people harder than the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   California is home to 29.6 million cars, motorcycles, trucks and
trailers that would be subject to the higher vehicle license fee if
it's approved and takes effect in January, as the governor proposes.</TE>
<TE>   The registration fee--computed at 2% of a vehicle's depreciated
value--has been reduced by slightly more than two-thirds since 1998
in a series of rebates approved by the Legislature. Davis wants to
suspend part of the rebate, restoring the fee to 1.5% of the
vehicle's value, for the 2003 calendar year.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the license fee for a 2002 Volvo wagon purchased
for $33,000 would jump from $215 to $497, according to a spokeswoman
for the Automobile Club of Southern California. Someone who paid
$18,000 for a 2000 Ford Explorer would see the fee rise from $82 to
$190. On a 1998 Honda Accord that cost $19,485, the fee would grow
from $114 to $234.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cohen of the state's legislative analyst's office said the
fee on a car valued at $9,200--the state average--would rise from $60
to $138, an increase of $78.</TE>
<TE>   Automobile Club spokeswoman Carol Thorp said the fee hike, when
combined with another Davis proposal to shift money from a
transportation fund to the general fund, represents a "double whammy"
for drivers. (A Davis spokeswoman said the borrowing proposed in the
governor's new budget is not expected to delay transportation
projects.)</TE>
<TE>   "We care about fairness," Thorp said. "We don't think the
motorists should be singled out for a disproportionate tax burden....
This is a significant amount of money."</TE>
<TE>   An administration spokeswoman pointed out that even at the amount
Davis proposes, the fee is still lower than it was in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still providing tax relief for Californians because they
will still be able to benefit from a 25% reduction in the vehicle
license fee," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. "It's a one-time
impact."</TE>
<TE>   Critics complain that even though the fee is based on a vehicle's
value, it still falls most heavily on the poor. A study by the
Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, California Policy Research
Center, found that in 1996 the fees represented an average 1.18% of
the annual income of the poorest 20% of the state's people, but only
0.41% of income for the wealthiest 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the poor say they prefer a proposal by Senate leader
John Burton (D-San Francisco) to raise $2.5 billion a year by
increasing the income tax on the wealthiest Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, a
group that lobbies for the poor during the budget process, said that
the top 1% of California taxpayers would still come out ahead under
Burton's plan when federal tax breaks are taken into account. These
households, she said, will have received an average federal tax cut
of $51,717 when it is fully phased in, compared with a state tax
increase of $7,674 under the Burton proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Ross also noted that new data released last week from the 2000
Census found widening gaps between California's rich and poor.
McLean, the governor's spokeswoman, said the top 5% of taxpayers in
California paid 70% of last year's personal income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could make one change in the [governor's revised budget], it
would be to swap the [Burton proposal] for the vehicle license fees,"
Ross said. "It would give you enough money so you could reverse some
of those deep reductions, particularly in terms of health and human
services, and it would tax those Californians who have fared the best
over the past decade."</TE>
<TE>   Some Californians are willing to pay the higher fees. About 3,000
members of the Pacific Institute for Community Organization, a
coalition of faith-based groups that has lobbied to expand health
coverage for the uninsured, are planning a Tuesday rally in
Sacramento. Members will fill out fake vehicle license fee checks to
demonstrate that they are willing to be part of the solution, but
they will also call for California's wealthy and corporations to do
more.</TE>
<TE>   "When people look at what cuts [proposed by Davis] will do to
health care, schools and local communities, they are willing to pay
more," said Jim Keddy of the coalition. "They just want to know where
the money is going to go and that people are paying something that is
fair."</TE>
<TE>   The fairness argument is also being invoked by those opposed to
raising the cigarette tax. Davis proposes increasing state excise
taxes levied on cigarettes by 50 cents to $1.37 per pack.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking among Californians has declined from about 23% in 1989 to
17% in 2000, while the number of cigarettes consumed has dropped by
more than half, according to Greg Oleva of the state Department of
Health Services' Tobacco Control Section.</TE>
<TE>   But the drop in smoking has not hit all Californians the same.
John Miller, staff director for the state Senate Committee on Health
and Human Services, said that Californians between the ages of 18 and
24, young working-class Asians and working-class whites continue to
have higher smoking rates.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and other health-care advocates have taken issue with the
fact that none of the money raised by the proposed cigarette tax is
earmarked for anti-smoking programs.</TE>
<TE>   The approach differs significantly from a proposal by Sen. Deborah
Ortiz (D-Sacramento) to raise the state excise tax on a pack of
cigarettes by 65 cents to $1.52, which would give California the
highest tax of that variety in the nation. Revenue generated from
Ortiz's proposal would fund anti-smoking programs and help cover
health-care costs for the working poor, such as treating asthma and
heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said efforts are underway to incorporate Davis' tobacco tax
hike into Ortiz's measure and to increase the tax from 50 cents to 65
cents. Revenue generated from the difference would go to fund health
and anti-smoking programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unconscionable to ask a minority to finance that amount of
services to the state and not realize any benefit whatsoever," Miller
said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Paul Knepprath, a lobbyist for the American Lung Assn. of
California: "Investing a small portion of the new tobacco tax
revenues will not only save more lives, but will save the state more
dollars down the road in health-care costs."</TE>
<TE>   Knepprath noted that Davis' new budget cuts $35 million from a
youth anti-tobacco program and borrows $4.5 billion against the
state's future share of the national tobacco settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Taken together, you have no investment in further reducing
tobacco consumption through prevention programs that have been proven
effective," Knepprath said.</TE>
<TE>   Knepprath cited an industry estimate that put the average cost of
a pack of cigarettes in California at $3.65 as of last summer. The
cost includes 87 cents in state excise taxes, 39 cents in federal
taxes and a base state sales tax rate of 7.25%.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco industry also has problems with the governor's
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris spokesman Tom Ryan said California smokers face some
of the highest taxes in the country. He also said that raising
cigarette taxes will only compound California's problems with the
black market, where smuggling and Internet sales--often without any
age verification--are cutting into the state's tax base and putting
tobacco into the hands of minors.</TE>
<TE>   "If our past experience is any indication, this is going to make
that problem worse," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Hiking state taxes on cigarettes, according to Ken August, a
spokesman for the California Department of Health Services, will
result in reduced consumption, particularly among teenagers, who are
sensitive to pricing.</TE>
<TE>   "This increase in the tax will have a great impact on reducing
youth smoking during a time when overall spending on anti-smoking
programs has to be reduced due to the budget problems in California,"
August said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokeswoman McLean said that by raising the tax, the
governor avoids making even deeper cuts to health programs.</TE>
<TE>   The timing for a tax fight could not be worse for Davis. He must
confront the fresh onslaught of criticism and the possibility of a
prolonged budget battle this summer as he seeks reelection in
November against Republican Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, who teaches political science at USC, said
that by throwing taxes on the table, Davis could find himself caught
between Democratic lawmakers seeking even greater increases, which
would allow them to restore certain spending cuts, and their
Republican counterparts who oppose any new taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts the governor in a very awkward position," Bebitch Jeffe
said. "If Democrats propose greater taxation, I think Republicans
will become more firm in their opposition. This gives them an issue
around which to unify ... which means it's going to be a very long
time before we get a budget, and that's not politically helpful for
Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tom McClintock, the Thousand Oaks Republican who has led a
crusade to eliminate vehicle license fees, said he believes the
governor's proposal will become a rallying point for Democrats and
Republicans alike.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't run into one person who doesn't know exactly how much
they're paying in the car tax," McClintock said. "All they have to do
is more than double what they are currently paying and that is what
it will cost. People know immediately what that means to them."</TE>

<HD>Pitchman Builds Project Support</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Advocates of slow growth are no fans of Tom
Tomlin, but for developers his services are seen as increasingly
critical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an age when a combative public either kills or carries
developments to approval, Tom Tomlin's services as a pitchman for
California builders are in high demand.</LD>
<LD>   Threatened with ballot measures and lawsuits aimed at halting
sprawl, developers are increasingly turning to Tomlin, a onetime
campaign operative for Ronald Reagan, and others like him for help in
winning public support.</LD>
<LD>   From Ventura to Escondido, the president of Century City-based Tom
Tomlin Associates conducts polling and runs focus groups selling
business owners, stay-at-home moms and horse enthusiasts on suburban
development.</LD>
<TE>   Tomlin organizes project supporters into "grass-roots" movements.
He buys them dinner and listens to their suggestions on everything
from equestrian trails to floor plans, which are then used to make a
project more desirable. In turn, they pack city council hearings for
him. They do the selling.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen or 20 years ago, I wasn't necessary," said Tomlin, 58.
"Now, in every community I go into, there are these 'slow-growth
environmentalists.' A developer can't build a project without
consensus-building."</TE>
<TE>   The market for consultants like Tomlin emerged in the mid-1980s,
when a real estate boom collided with a rising slow-growth movement,
said Bill Fulton, a California land-use expert.</TE>
<TE>   "Consultants who help developers have always been around," Fulton
said. "The difference is, they're moving from consultants who
schmooze the politicians to consultants who schmooze the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Any large development project in a community is essentially a
political campaign now. There's always the threat of a ballot measure
or a lawsuit. So you have to sell the public from the moment you
unveil the project."</TE>
<TE>   To date, Tomlin's strategies have helped develop 8,000 homes
statewide. He is working on half a dozen projects, with his fees per
project ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 a year. Two of his thornier
developments are in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, Unocal's the Canyons would add 1,600 homes and a
business park. The Ranch at Santa Paula by Pinnacle Development Group
would double the geographic size of the city and add 2,250 homes, in
addition to apartments and a shopping complex. Both projects require
extending city boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County-based Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources,
one of the most effective slow-growth organizations in the nation, is
pushing ballot initiatives this fall that could block both
developments. The group argues that the projects will increase sprawl
without meeting affordable housing needs.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Councilwoman Barbra Williamson said Tomlin's ability
to engage the public gives elected officials "a feel for what's
acceptable. I'm a servant of the people. If they're telling me
they've listened to Mr. Tomlin, and he's good and they're happy, what
am I going to do? Tell them they're all wrong?"</TE>
<TE>   But Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks, a slow-growth
activist, disagrees. "You'll not see Tom Tomlin come to a meeting and
say, 'Hi, I'm Tom Tomlin, the PR guy,'" she said. "It's all disguised
through these minions, shills who appear to be genuine supporters."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Tomlin's adversaries say they respect his skills but find
his work dishonest.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are in the hands of a master," said Richard Francis,
a Ventura attorney and driving force behind SOAR. "He goes into a
community, runs these little focus groups, tries to peel off the
edges, and tries to make people think they have a sense of
empowerment, when in fact there is none because he is completely
pulling the strings."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin feels an equal disdain for Francis and his crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a great way of framing the issues: urban sprawl,
traffic--all those buzzwords. I've always felt they're an elitist
group. The bottom line is, they've got theirs and they don't want
anyone else to have theirs."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin's efforts in both Simi Valley and Santa Paula are just
gearing up. But his background provides a road map of what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Tomlin saw his future in politics. At Pepperdine
University, he earned a bachelor's degree in political science. He
went to work for Ronald Reagan's 1966 gubernatorial campaign as an
assistant campaign manager. From 1967 to 1970, he ran Southern
California campaigns for the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned press relations, how to identify target publics,
strategy, research," Tomlin said. "It was like going to graduate
school--but for real."</TE>
<TE>   The money wasn't great. And burnout came quickly. When public
relations man Carl Terzian asked Tomlin to join his start-up firm in
Los Angeles, Tomlin signed on.</TE>
<TE>   He still craved politics. But then, he thought, wasn't selling
California homeowners on growth the ultimate political challenge?</TE>
<TE>   As president of Terzian's firm, Tomlin managed Fox Studios'
campaign to expand its Century City lot starting in 1991. A local
homeowners group opposed the project. While Los Angeles grappled with
recession, Tomlin made his case: The expansion meant more jobs.
Rejecting the expansion meant Fox might pick up and leave.</TE>
<TE>   He formed "Friends of Fox," tapping area business owners and
neighbors. Hundreds packed hearing rooms. Fox mounted a celebrity
campaign. In 1993, the City Council approved the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin left Terzian's firm to start his own in 1997. He took with
him client New Urban West Inc., which planned to build Long Canyon, a
650-home community in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Dominique Dunn, 56, a local resident who lives two blocks from the
development, remembers getting a call from Tomlin asking her to join
"Friends of Long Canyon."</TE>
<TE>   She accepted. "I figured it was a foregone conclusion that it was
going to be built, so my thought was to make sure it was done right."</TE>
<TE>   She told Tomlin she was concerned that the plans would raze too
many of the oak trees near her home. New Urban West agreed to reroute
a road, she said, creating a more rural look and saving many trees.</TE>
<TE>   The executive committee met once a month; the developer picked up
the dinner tab. They talked about everything, including home design.
"They'd show us the floor plans for the models and, literally, we'd
say, 'No, we don't like this floor plan,' and they'd change it," Dunn
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Her committee was given an annual stipend of $12,000 to distribute
to local charities, she said.</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to go before the City Council, she and hundreds
of others did. "You didn't feel like you were being used," she said.
"I like to know what goes on in my community and feel I have a say."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, on another New Urban West project in Escondido,
Tomlin learned that several neighbors opposed a 222-home project
because it would pave over land they used for horseback riding.</TE>
<TE>   The developer altered its plans to add a public equestrian trail.
"We were able to accommodate their needs and they supported us in the
public arena," said Tom Zanic, vice president of New Urban West.</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin hasn't won over everybody.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Lee Custodio of Thousand Oaks took issue with the
master-planned Dos Vientos community near her Newbury Park home, and
sued the developer over a road extension. Tomlin has represented one
of the project's developers since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Tommy Tomlin manages the public," Custodio said. "He keeps them
stupid. If a project is a good deal for the public, it sells itself.
You don't need an agent."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin and other consultants disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all kinds of people out there who are not aware of a
project that will benefit them," said Debra Stein, president of GCA
Strategies in San Francisco. "They need to be brought into the
process and motivated to participate. Their opinion is as valid as
someone who wants to be able to keep using someone else's property to
walk their dog on for free."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin says there is no shortage of business. The state is in a
housing crisis. And slow-growth activists become more sophisticated
every day.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a community in this state that puts up signs saying
'Developers welcome,'" he said. "If it was easy, no one would hire
me."</TE>

<HD>'We'll Always Have Newhall'</HD>
<DH>It may never have the allure of Paris, but Santa Clarita is
pushing to sell itself as a popular vacation spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The problem Laura Karp faces is as old as the travel industry: how to
draw visitors to a community that few people think of as a vacation
destination.</LD>
<LD>   As the first paid head of the Santa Clarita Valley Tourism Bureau,
Karp is trying to recast the bedroom community 30 miles north of
downtown Los Angeles as a place where people will spend a night or
two and a chunk of their travel budget.</LD>
<LD>   As such, it is what travel professionals refer to as an "emerging
destination"--just as Southern California itself was 75 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Will there ever be a day when a Humphrey Bogart-type will turn to
an Ingrid Bergman-type and mutter, misty-eyed, "We'll always have
Newhall," instead of Paris? Karp thinks it could happen.</TE>
<TE>   One of Karp's appointed tasks is articulating Santa Clarita's
"story," the short, resonant description of the community that will
make the family buckle the kids into the SUV, fill up the tank and
head for Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   High points of that story, according to Karp: "There's a lot to do
here. We're not just a little drive-through town. We're a great
alternative [to more urbanized destinations]. Families want to
travel, and they want to feel safe. They're a little intimidated by
Los Angeles or Santa Monica."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is cultural tourism, a hot topic ever since Frank
Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilboa, Spain, became a destination for
culture-hungry visitors from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Cultural tourism is really big," said Karp, "and we've got a lot
of Western heritage here in the Santa Clarita Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen-year-old Santa Clarita has long seen tourism as an
important potential source of revenue, according to its first and
only director of economic development, Mike Haviland.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, he said, "no one had any kind of mind-set of what
tourism is and the economic benefit it can bring to the community.
They come into the area and spend their money and then they leave,"
requiring far less investment in infrastructure and services than
residents do.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita's tourism bureau is unusual in that it is a city
department, not a function of the Chamber of Commerce, according to
Los Angeles-based travel and tourism consultant Lauren Schlau, hired
to write its three-year marketing plan.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to paying Karp's $57,000 annual salary, the city
budgets about $40,000 a year from its general fund to promote
tourism. About $1 million a year goes into the general fund from the
city's 10% transient occupancy tax, or hotel tax.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau also gets $60,000 from its private-sector partners,
including local hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, all destinations are sold the same way, according to
John Bateman, a Los Angeles-based travel marketer who currently
pitches Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   Every destination has a dream connected with it, an idyllic
picture in the traveler's mind of its special attractions, Bateman
said. "You have to take that dream and match it with the reality in
order to sell it."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Bateman marketed British Columbia. The dream of western
Canada was, he said: "Mooses, mountains and Mounties. How can you go
wrong?"</TE>
<TE>   For visitors, those images suggested both natural beauty and,
thanks to the Mounties, safety, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Security is always a concern of travelers, and never more so than
now, post-Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Ruth McGettigan was the West Coast marketer for
travel to the Cayman Islands.</TE>
<TE>   She said she sold the Caribbean community's beautiful beaches,
friendly people and low crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Caymans have the highest standard of living in the
Caribbean," she said. "If you don't have poverty, you don't have
pickpockets."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita also sees itself as rich with natural beauty, with a
crime rate to brag about. In 2001, it was named the sixth-safest city
in the country, based on FBI crime statistics.</TE>
<TE>   But safety can suggest dullness as well as security. Santa Clarita
has a number of negatives to overcome, Karp admitted.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're a fairly young city, people don't know we're out
here," she said. People who recognize Valencia and Newhall as
Southern California communities don't necessarily understand that
they are now part of the city of Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   And, Karp said, "There's still the perception that we're way out
there."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the city is 40 miles from LAX and just 30 minutes from
Burbank Airport, she said.</TE>
<TE>   To make the traveling public aware of the city's relative
proximity and such attractions as its annual Cowboy Poetry and Music
Festival, Santa Clarita is taking a multi-pronged approach. It makes
sure its brochures are displayed in local airports and reaches out to
other convention and visitors bureaus. It is working with Caltrans
for better, more alluring signs along the freeways. And it offers a
coupon on its Web site for 20% off rooms at participating hotels.</TE>
<TE>   The 800-pound gorilla among the bureau's private partners is Six
Flags Magic Mountain amusement park. Haviland said he realized early
on that Magic Mountain was key to attracting tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having Disneyland next to you," he said. "It was a
glowing opportunity to build from."</TE>
<TE>   The park attracts about 3 million visitors a year, Schlau reports.
Although that is far fewer than Disneyland's 12 million annual
visitors, Magic Mountain is a major regional draw, Schlau writes,
pulling in large numbers of people who live a two- to six-hour drive
away or who fly into Burbank Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Karp said the bureau "piggybacks" on Magic Mountain's big-budget
effort to attract tourists by making a modest contribution to its ad
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, the theme park comes up with a slogan that mentions
both park and community: "This year, it's 'Play at Six Flags, stay in
Santa Clarita,'" Karp said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita's identity--its brand, as it were--is still a work
in progress, Karp and others agree.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have the words for it yet, but I have the concept--L.A.'s
backyard playground," said Schlau.</TE>
<TE>   Karp said that the very diversity of local attractions--the
William S. Hart Museum, Castaic Lake, golf courses, multiple
locations where films are shot, Town Center Drive (which she compares
to Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade)--complicates the task of
creating a coherent image for the community.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone has got the word about Santa Clarita as a tourist
destination. Eric Onnen is chief executive of Santa Barbara Air Bus,
which runs bus excursions throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Onnen said his customers--several thousand a year--regularly ask
for trips to Six Flags Magic Mountain and its water park, Hurricane
Harbor. "Those are known attractions," he said. The Cowboy Poetry
Festival and other newer Santa Clarita venues have yet to catch the
eye of his customers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Karp is confident Santa Clarita can become a tourist mecca, or
a one- or two-night stop on the road to such established destinations
as San Diego and San Francisco. Travel by car is up in the wake of
Sept. 11, Karp said, and so is occupancy of the city's 2,000 hotel
rooms--almost 5% from a year ago, to more than 83%.</TE>
<TE>   And who cares if Santa Clarita lacks such sure-fire draws as an
ocean beach? So does Palm Springs, Schlau pointed out, and people go
there in droves, even in the summer when it is hot enough to melt
your flip-flops.</TE>

<HD>On the Trail of a Man Behind Taliban's Air Fleet</HD>
<DH>Authorities say Victor Bout supplied combatants in hot
spots around the world. The elusive entrepreneur is free in Moscow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>By Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The files on Victor Bout in government agencies around the world brim
with accounts of how he hunted game with rebel leaders, threw beer
parties on jungle landing strips and consorted with dictators to
build his business empire. For a decade, his armada of aircraft has
hauled almost anything for a price: fish, coffee, relief supplies,
flowers, and heads of state and their wives.</LD>
<LD>   International authorities say the 35-year-old Russian also
operates the world's largest private weapons transport network,
carrying military goods as small as Kalashnikov assault rifle rounds
and as large as helicopter gunships. Bout's businesses have been
blamed for arming civil wars throughout Africa, despite international
embargoes.</LD>
<TE>   "Victor Bout is like the Donald Trump or Bill Gates of arms
trafficking," said a U.S. Defense Department official. "He's the
biggest kid on the block."</TE>
<TE>   Now a Times investigation has uncovered evidence that companies
tied to Bout helped the Taliban build an air fleet that secretly
delivered weapons, equipment and recruits during a crucial period in
the late 1990s. The hard-line Islamic regime bought air freighters
from the firms and disguised some of them in the colors of
Afghanistan's national airline so that cargo could be delivered
without attracting notice. The deals were arranged while the Taliban
battled opposition forces for power and the ruling mullahs' patron,
Osama bin Laden, launched his holy war against Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations provide significant new details of how the Taliban
and Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist organization imported armaments
wielded in combat against American soldiers. Both militant groups
drew from the same arms caches, according to U.S. officials tracing
munitions found after last year's fighting. The accounts also provide
a close-up view of how weak arms-trafficking laws and poor
international coordination can hamper the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   American authorities say Bout--with operations scattered from the
United Arab Emirates to the United States--embodies a new class of
global enablers with the resources to serve terrorists. Though not
affiliated with any known faction, Bout is considered a
"transnational threat" by the U.S. government, posing danger through
his worldwide reach.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three years, the United Nations has publicly
condemned him. The White House worked quietly to build a case against
him. The U.S. secretary of State urged South Africa's president to
prosecute Bout. A ranking British Foreign Ministry official denounced
him in Parliament. Belgium is seeking his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   But Bout has been a master of fast exits. He left Belgium and
South Africa soon after police opened investigations into his
flights. As American and British officials tried to establish the
nature of his dealings with the Taliban, Bout slipped out of the
Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   He remains a free man in Moscow, sheltered by a Russian government
skeptical of the allegations against him. He declined repeated
interview requests through intermediaries during the last several
months. In late April, his lawyer, Victor Burobin, quoted Bout as
saying, "I haven't committed any crimes." Earlier, Bout told a Moscow
radio station that he had not "entered any contacts with Taliban or
Al Qaeda representatives."</TE>
<TE>   To put together a picture of Bout and his operations, The Times
conducted interviews with more than 75 military, diplomatic and
government officials in Afghanistan, the U.S., the Emirates, Russia,
Europe and Africa, as well as with air industry workers and Bout
associates in those nations. Afghan officials corroborated their
accounts with a thick stack of documents from the deposed Taliban
government.</TE>
<TE>   The chronicle of Bout's rise in Africa and his clandestine work in
Afghanistan is a narrative that is still unfolding, a tale of nations
pitted against one resourceful man.</TE>
<TE>   ORIGINS</TE>
<TE>   Billing Himself as an Average Ivan</TE>
<TE>   Victor Bout's known biography is spare. A native of Tajikistan, he
is a Soviet military veteran fluent in at least five languages.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with a Russian newspaper, Bout portrayed himself
as a hard-working, misunderstood and much-slandered businessman, an
average Ivan Ivanov of unpretentious roots, the son of a car mechanic
and a bookkeeper who went to a school for military translators and
emerged from the army with the rank of lieutenant before going into
the air cargo trade.</TE>
<TE>   The financing of his aviation network remains murky. But he found
a gold mine in surplus weaponry. Russia's discarded stockpiles "have
tremendous value to warring countries in Africa and anywhere you need
guns," said Jonathan Winer, a former deputy assistant secretary of
State for international enforcement in the Clinton administration.
"It's capitalism, comrade."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Sidorenko, a decorated former Soviet
paratrooper, recalls Bout working as a trade representative in
Luanda, Angola, when the Soviet empire collapsed in 1990. Bout joined
him, leasing and buying planes until the two men split in 1994. "If
he had a hobby, it was money," Sidorenko said.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1990s, Bout had gained a reputation for toughness and
nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "Bout was always ready to work under any risk," said Valery
Spurnov, general director of SpAir Aviation in Yekaterinburg and a
former Soviet civil aviation official. Bout spirited off
reconditioned Antonovs, "which were nothing more than piles of scrap
metal," Spurnov said. One aged plane, said another Russian aviator,
had been junked and slated for display as a monument in the Smolensk
Rocket and Artillery School before Bout revived it as a transport.</TE>
<TE>   What separates Bout from his competitors, Western authorities
said, is the size of his network. As of April, U.S. officials had
linked to Bout at least 60 planes, a private cargo wing dwarfing all
others in the Third World, registered from Aruba to Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department says Bout's companies have 300 employees. His
pilots, mostly Ukrainians and Russians, reportedly have been paid up
to $10,000 for each hazardous run into war zones. Several Antonovs
have crashed, including two that were shot down on African flights in
the early 1990s, killing all aboard, Spurnov said.</TE>
<TE>   Short-lived Bout firms have operated on  four  continents. Among
their names: Transavia, Air Pass, Centrafrican, San Air, CET, IRBIS
and Air Cess, the flagship that U.S. officials say Bout has entrusted
to his older brother, Sergei.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a wheeler-dealer who operates very effectively in a part of
the world where scrutiny is poor," said Alex Vines, a British arms
expert for the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   His planes were frequently transferred from one of his companies
to another and from country to country. One plane, for example, was
registered in Swaziland but owned by a South African company. Others
were registered in Liberia but based in the Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Bout's primary arms work is transport, U.S. and U.N. officials
say, but they say his operation also brokers weapons from stockpiles
across Eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   A U.N. report cited one spate of 38 Air Cess flights to Africa
from the Bulgarian port of Burgas, home to several weapons factories.
The arms cargoes fetched a total of $14 million, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you supply to an embargoed country, the price goes up," said
Johan Peleman, a Belgian arms expert who has spent seven years
tracking Bout for the U.N. and a research institute in Antwerp.</TE>
<TE>   Bout acquired mansions, a Porsche, a Mercedes and a Range Rover,
according to investigators and acquaintances. He co-owned an
apartment in an exclusive Moscow district and reportedly had an
estate on the Belgian coast near Ostend, a house in South Africa and
a gated residence in the emirate of Sharjah, his main air hub since
the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Stout, with a trim mustache, Bout projects charm and swagger,
intimates say. In Sharjah, where his firms competed with several
dozen Russian air cargo firms plying Asian and African routes, he was
a man apart, cultivating the powerful and cinching deals others
nervously turned down.</TE>
<TE>   While rivals scraped to stay in business, Bout hobnobbed with
royalty on the "sheikly wedding circuit," one Western diplomat said.
In the devout Islamic emirate, where liquor is banned, associates
said his office bar was fully stocked.</TE>
<TE>   He could be generous, as Vladislav Ketov, a noted Russian
bicyclist, discovered when he was stranded in Sharjah during a trip
around the world. Bout paid for a ticket home to Russia, and over the
next five years, sent $50,000 for Ketov's altruistic projects.</TE>
<TE>   In return, Ketov offered to paste the Air Cess logo on his bike.
"But he modestly declined my offer, saying, 'My company doesn't need
much advertising,'" Ketov said.</TE>
<TE>   AFRICA</TE>
<TE>   Governments and Rebels Allegedly Among Clients</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and U.N. officials say Bout and other arms suppliers
airlifted thousands upon thousands of assault rifles, grenade and
missile launchers and millions of ammunition rounds into Africa.
Clients of Bout's companies, U.S. and U.N. officials say, included
rebels or governments in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Liberia, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Uganda and Sudan. In Libya,
he developed a working relationship with Col. Moammar Kadafi, they
say, and in Angola, Bout's ventures armed both insurgents and army
regulars.</TE>
<TE>   The first hint of Bout's work came to U.S. officials in distant
snatches of Russian picked up in 1995 intercepts of African phone
conversations. Thumbing through transcripts, U.S. officials noticed a
name repeated in chatter about weapons shipments in the Great Lakes
region of Central Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The pronunciation varied, matching alternative spellings used on
five Russian passports that the U.N. alleges Bout has carried.
Sometimes, he was Bout; at other times, he was Butt, Boutov, Budd or
Bouta.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Bout seemed a minor player in the continent's tribal
and power struggles. But as months passed, "we started seeing his
fleet in all parts of Africa," a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. has accused him of violating embargoes in Liberia, Sierra
Leone and Angola. The African conflicts covered by the sanctions are
not wars in the conventional sense but anarchic slaughter. Toting
Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, teenage fighters
spray hundreds of rounds at a clip. Civilians have died by the tens
of thousands. Missiles have been fired at planes carrying relief
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   In Congo, formerly Zaire, where a 31/2-year war has claimed 2
million lives, Bout's work so pleased Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of
the rebel Congolese Liberation Movement, or MLC, that he joined the
Russian supplier on hunting trips, U.N. investigator Peleman said.</TE>
<TE>   A Bout firm serviced and chartered aircraft for Libya for several
years, U.S. officials said. Bout also provided assistance when Kadafi
negotiated the release of six European hostages held in the
Philippines by Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic rebel group whose leader had
trained in Libya. Libya hired a plane provided by Bout to deliver the
freed captives, and Kadafi later portrayed the intervention as a
humanitarian act that warranted an end to international sanctions
against his regime.</TE>
<TE>   Performing such errands "got [Bout] in good standing with heads of
state, and it was good for business," said Lee S. Wolosky, who was
the National Security Council's Bout specialist until last July.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of the Cold War, thousands of private arms brokers
and transporters have entered a munitions trade once the exclusive
domain of nations. The Wassenaar Arrangement, a 1996 pact by 33
nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the former
Soviet bloc, promised to restrict and monitor the flow of large
conventional weaponry such as tanks and fighter jets.</TE>
<TE>   But brokers and transporters of rifles and other small weapons
easily bypass even the toughest national laws by staying on the move.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. push in 1998 for standardized laws in Europe was rebuffed
by countries with deeply rooted arms-brokering industries, including
Russia, most of Eastern Europe, Spain, Portugal and Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. efforts to impose arms embargoes have been similarly
frustrated. By the late 1990s, U.N. officials acknowledged that their
sanctions were porous and dispatched experts to learn how munitions
continued to get through.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Larrain, a former Chilean diplomat who heads the
U.N.'s Angola panel, said Bout has stood out, "implicated in so many
conflicts around the world."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. and the U.S. imposed bans on military aid to the Taliban
in 2000. When a U.N. team was asked last year to examine how weapons
entered Afghanistan, Bout's name surfaced again.</TE>
<TE>   Bout catered to the opposition Northern Alliance, flying in tons
of ammunition when it ruled in the mid-1990s, former alliance
officials said. He stopped working for the alliance when the Taliban
seized power in Kabul in September 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "He was working for us," said Abdul Latif, Bout's main arms
contact in the alliance. "And then he was working for the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   AFGHANISTAN</TE>
<TE>   Alliance Contact Brought Suitcases of Cash</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the Northern Alliance found its stock of
ammunition running low, Latif said, he would bring suitcases stuffed
with cash to Bout. Between 1992 and 1996, when the alliance governed
Afghanistan, Bout-leased Ilyushins carried tons of ammunition to
troops fighting the Taliban and other factions, former alliance
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Bout's arms prices were "very expensive," said Ahmed Muslem Hayat,
a former aide to the defense minister. "One shell for tanks was $60.
And from Russia, officially, they were $10."</TE>
<TE>   The alliance had to deal with Bout, Hayat said, because the
Russian government would not sell arms to them, preferring not to
take sides in the Afghan civil war. But the Russians also did not
interfere with Bout, who holds Russian citizenship. His flights "did
not violate international laws," said veteran Russian diplomat Zamir
Kabulov.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 3, 1995, Bout's furtive business was outed by the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   A Taliban MIG fighter forced down a Bout-leased Ilyushin carrying
3.4 million Kalashnikov rounds as it neared the Taliban stronghold of
Kandahar. Taliban soldiers seized the munitions and took the
seven-member crew hostage.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian government sent Kabulov, who at times was accompanied
by Bout or his brother Sergei, to negotiate for the crew's release.</TE>
<TE>   After waiting a year, the prisoners laid plans for a break. In
August 1996, Kabulov said, Bout arranged with Iranian air traffic
controllers for a clear air corridor to the Emirates. According to
Russian accounts, the crew overpowered guards and flew the Ilyushin
to freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, U.S. officials say, a Bout firm started doing
business with the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   A 25-year-old Taliban mullah met in a Sharjah hotel room with
representatives of cargo firms owned by Bout and an Emirates
businessman to obtain supplies for the fundamentalist Islamic
movement, said a former official of Ariana Afghan Airlines, who was
present at the meeting. Ariana is the national carrier of
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The mullah, Farid Ahmed, and other Taliban officials were seeking
planes, tires, spare parts, engines, oil, hydraulic fluid--all
essential for starting up their own air cargo operation. Ahmed was
there representing the Taliban leadership, Ariana and Afghan aviation
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   They were soon scouring air cargo offices at the Sharjah airport,
shopping openly because the Emirates was one of only three nations
that recognized the Taliban. The other nations were Pakistan and
Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Mankhayev, general manager of Republic Air Co. in Sharjah,
said a Taliban broker stunned him with a shopping list of "civilian
aircraft and spare parts" and a second list of "weapons, ammunition
and MIG combat aircraft," along with several dozen armament
varieties, from grenade launchers to ground rockets. Mankhayev and
other aviators said they refused the business.</TE>
<TE>   But Ahmed found reliable suppliers in companies owned by Bout and
the Emirates' Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed al Saqr al Nahyan, described
by the U.N. as "a business associate of Victor Bout."</TE>
<TE>   Between 1998 and 2001, Ahmed bought five planes from two
companies, Vial and Air Cess, that authorities say were controlled by
Bout. A Belgian official said Bout had power of attorney over Vial, a
Delaware firm later cited in the Belgian arrest warrant for Bout.</TE>
<TE>   Bout founded Air Cess in Liberia, say U.S. and U.N. officials.
These officials say that at some point in the 1990s, Bout transferred
its daily operations to his brother Sergei. A man contacted by The
Times who identified himself as Sergei Bout declined to discuss
details of his business.</TE>
<TE>   Spurnov, the Russian air executive, said Victor Bout also provided
pilots to the Taliban. Spurnov said about 50 of his pilots were hired
by Bout companies in the late 1990s. Spurnov said some told him of
repeated runs hauling green crates, standard containers for Eastern
European-made ammunition and weapons, into Afghanistan. The flights,
he said, continued even after 1995, when Russian aviation companies
were notified by their government that they could no longer fly into
Taliban-controlled territory. But the rule didn't apply to Bout
because his companies were licensed in Sharjah.</TE>
<TE>   Five more planes were sold to the Taliban by Flying Dolphin and
Santa Cruz Imperial, which were owned by Bin Zayed, a former Emirates
ambassador to Washington. Santa Cruz Imperial has been accused by the
U.N. of trafficking arms to Angola.</TE>
<TE>   The sheik angrily insisted in an interview that "he had no
clue" why Afghan records detail sales of five of his Antonovs to the
Taliban. He said he knew Ahmed and Bout but never worked with them.
He said his former "Russian partners" owned the planes. He said he
parted with the men five years ago, but he would not name them.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed, working in the same cargo terminal as Bout's Air Cess,
remained a visible figure in Sharjah until shortly after the
Taliban's collapse last November.</TE>
<TE>   He had little to say when reached by The Times last month at a
Dubai phone number.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not Taliban," he said, adding that "the Russian companies
helped us, yes, but only in fixing the planes." And, "I have nothing
to do with guns."</TE>
<TE>   He then turned the phone over to a companion who insisted, in
quick succession, that Ahmed was unavailable, living in Sharjah, in
Kabul--and, finally, unknown to him altogether.</TE>
<TE>   THE TALIBAN AIRLIFT</TE>
<TE>   Planes Had Key Role in Arming the Movement</TE>
<TE>   Five of the planes sold to the Taliban--all Antonov 12s--became
important tools in the covert arming of the movement's forces.</TE>
<TE>   "It was special aircraft," said an Afghan air force brigadier who
recalled watching the planes in action. And their purpose "was
secret," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The Antonov-12s had been registered as civilian planes but were in
reality the property of the Taliban air force. As they took custody
of the Antonov-12s, Taliban officials ordered some of the planes
camouflaged in the colors of Ariana Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban's new acquisitions flew in tons of heavy artillery and
assault rifles, said the brigadier, a senior military intelligence
official who served with the Taliban until he was dismissed in a
purge in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "They directly brought the military equipment to Kabul and
Kandahar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On several occasions, the brigadier said, he watched the
Antonov-12s being unloaded at an air base in Kabul, the capital. He
said he saw heavy artillery, Kalashnikovs, aerial bombs and Russian
BM-21 Hurricane rocket batteries.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. defense official said that American forces have since
retrieved BM-21s from Taliban and Al Qaeda storehouses in Afghanistan
and are working to trace their provenance.</TE>
<TE>   On other trips from the Emirates and Pakistan, the brigadier said,
the planes brought "armed Taliban." The Antonovs shuttled back and
forth several times a night, he said, ferrying as many as 800 to
1,000 recruits to Kabul and Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The airlift made possible by the plane sales kept the Taliban
supplied as the Islamic movement worked to tighten its grip on the
nation. Within months, the Taliban took the strategic northern
enclaves of Mazar-i-Sharif and Taloqan. By 1999, it controlled about
90% of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   All of the planes were placed on the civil air registry at the
command of the Taliban aviation minister, Mullah Aktar Mohammed
Mansour, who also ran the Taliban air force. Mansour was reportedly
killed in an American airstrike last October.</TE>
<TE>   Mansour's cowed underlings did not object. "From the legal point
of view we should not have done it," a senior Afghan official said.
"But what could you do? The minister ordered it, and we had no
choice."</TE>
<TE>   All the Afghan officials interviewed by The Times declined to be
identified in print. Having endured the Taliban's five-year rule,
many said they fear terrorist reprisals for speaking out. But they
decided to answer questions, some said, to distance both the airline
and the Afghan government from the Taliban scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The officials allowed The Times to review documents left behind by
the mullahs. The records show the serial numbers for each of the 10
planes sold by Bout's and Bin Zayed's companies and the dates they
entered the Afghan civil air registry. In addition, two other planes
purchased during this period could not be linked to Bout or Bin
Zayed.</TE>
<TE>   Among the documents was a detailed protocol, signed by both
Aviation Ministry and Ariana officials, outlining their plan to paint
some of the air force turboprops as Ariana planes.The file also
included false Ariana ID cards for four Taliban pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was to fly to destinations outside Afghanistan without
interference, an Ariana official said. Another official said he was
told by the Taliban "that if it did not go under the color of Ariana,
maybe Sharjah airport would have to get special permission" from
Emirates air officials to permit military landings.</TE>
<TE>   The plan worked, according to Afghan officials who were aware of
the flights and air industry workers who saw the turboprops on
Sharjah's runways.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials said five remaining planes were actually sold to
Ariana, and they too might have been used to ferry weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ghanem Hajri, the director-general of the Sharjah Airport
Authority, insisted that no military cargo went out on Afghan-bound
flights. The planes carried only "general cargo," he said, and were
"thoroughly checked and rechecked by our security services."</TE>
<TE>   The secret fleet ended up decimated by American bombs. On a
military runway in Kabul, two blackened, shredded Antonov-12s lie in
piles of metal scraps, angry sculptures rusting in the sun. The tail
and wing fragments still bear Ariana's blue and white colors.</TE>
<TE>   THE CHASE</TE>
<TE>   Activities in Africa Focus of U.S. Meeting</TE>
<TE>   In late summer 2000, soon after the Taliban took possession of the
last of the Antonovs sold by Bout and Bin Zayed's firms, six National
Security Council, diplomatic and intelligence officials gathered in
the executive building next to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   They knew nothing about the Afghan airplane acquisitions. But they
had learned a lot about Victor Bout's activities in Africa. They knew
that Bout had talked openly on the telephone about weapons shipments,
and they had tracked the runway movements of planes he controlled,
according to sources familiar with the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In a high-ceilinged suite, the officials laid out their facts
to the NSC's counter-terrorism director, Richard Clarke. After 20
minutes at the conference table, Clarke had heard enough. His
marching orders were terse.</TE>
<TE>   "Get me a warrant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton had raised the issue of unfettered arms trading
in an earlier speech at the United Nations. A directive he signed
afterward made the mission clear: Suppliers who catered to criminal
enterprises had to be confronted before they linked up with
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Stopping Bout, Clarke told aides, could be a lesson in how to stop
others.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the international options were limited, the U.S. turned to
a "campaign to disrupt Bout and his assets," a former NSC official
said. The strategy was to urge nations where Bout had operations to
file charges against him and shut him down.</TE>
<TE>   In return, the U.S. promised to back them up with the full force
of its intelligence and diplomatic machinery.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Americans focused on South Africa. Bout had shown up
there in 1997, flying planes out of Pietersburg Gateway airport. He
had left in 1998, after police had begun investigating his
activities. But U.S. officials felt that the South Africans could
still target him under an anti-mercenary law.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright brought up the subject with
President Thabo Mbeki during a visit that September. Mbeki said he
wanted to work with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But optimism fizzled when Jan D'Oliveira, a top South African
prosecutor, said he could not make a case.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone says that Victor Bout landed at a certain point, can
you connect it with a certain offense?" D'Oliveira said later. The
Emirates seemed more promising. The British wanted help in their own
Bout strategy: an attempt to publicly shame him and drive him from
the Emirates. A top Foreign Ministry official, Peter Hain, denounced
Bout as a "merchant of death" in Parliament speeches.</TE>
<TE>   But Western diplomats discovered how difficult it was to stir the
Emirates to action.</TE>
<TE>   Bout had an influential partner in Sharjah, Sultan Hamad Said
Nassir al Suwaidi, advisor to the ruler of Sharjah. A 1998 Emirates
document obtained by The Times says he was a co-owner with Bout of
Transavia. The royal aide did not respond to attempts to interview
him.</TE>
<TE>   Emirates bureaucrats also proved frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as [Bout] complies with the norms and regulations here,
he is most welcome," said Hajri, Sharjah's airport administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke, who had close ties with senior officials in the Emirates,
took on the task of high-level contacts with the Persian Gulf nation.
U.S. officials discussed Bout during a White House visit by Emirates
Foreign Minister Sheik Hamdan bin Zayed al Nahyan. The Emirates said
they needed hard evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. did not always oblige. For example, the Emirates offered
to crack down on Bout's assets if the Americans would provide
specifics about his bank accounts. But the U.S. did not want to
compromise intelligence sources, a former federal official said.</TE>
<TE>   After President Bush took office, Clarke authorized State
Department officials to ask the Emirates to take specific measures to
pressure Bout.</TE>
<TE>   Emirates officials recently informed the U.N. that Air Cess and
Transavia had been de-registered and that the Bout brothers no longer
had visas to enter the nation.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, said one Emirates official, "we decided we don't
need this guy's money and we don't need him going back and forth in
the UAE."</TE>
<TE>   AMERICA</TE>
<TE>   Obstacles to Obtaining a Warrant on U.S. Soil</TE>
<TE>   Bout's American pursuers also explored whether the warrant Clarke
wanted could be produced at home. Federal law enforcement agencies
were uncovering evidence that Bout had interests in several U.S.
cities.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice and Treasury departments saw some of the same hurdles
that had surfaced in the Emirates. Proving a criminal case would be
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, the U.S. had a stronger law than most. The 1996 Arms
Export Control Act mandated that all weapons brokers with U.S.
operations had to register with the State Department. Under the act,
munitions sales were allowed only to national governments or others
specifically approved by the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   American dealers who violate the law anywhere in the world can be
prosecuted. So can foreign nationals who break the law while
conducting business within the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   To charge Bout, authorities would have to prove that he had
operations here, then find clear evidence of crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, San Air General Trading was established in Plano, a
Dallas suburb. San Air's agent was Richard Chichakli, a Syrian-born
U.S. accountant from nearby Richardson who had met Bout while he
managed Sharjah's free-trade zone from 1993 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Bout's name did not appear on the corporate papers. But two
Russian associates, based in the Emirates, were listed as directors.
Federal agents pored over the company's phone records, learning that
callers from Plano were in frequent communication with Bout's
enterprises abroad. But there was no evidence of wrongdoing. The
Texas branch of San Air is now defunct.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Chichakli said he "set [San Air] up for
Victor," who aimed to build a factory to manufacture plastic parts
for the Russian planes central to his business. But the U.N. arms
allegations, which also mention him as a Bout financial advisor, made
it impossible to proceed, Chichakli said.</TE>
<TE>   Bout applied for a visa in summer 2000 at the U.S. Embassy in Abu
Dhabi, listing the Plano corporate address as his destination.
Authorities learned that Bout also intended to shop in Florida for
high-tech telecommunications equipment regulated by the federal
government, a former U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   The officials hoped that investigators might catch their quarry in
the act of violating the anti-brokering law or committing other
crimes. They were unaware until later that Bout's visit was held up
by consular officials who discovered that he was on an embassy watch
list. Bout never reapplied.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a good thing to let him come and watch what he
did," the former official said.</TE>
<TE>   And abroad, the failure to share information took a toll.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2001, U.S. officials tried to persuade a Belgian
prosecutor to file money-laundering charges against Bout. The meeting
at the U.S. Embassy in Brussels went nowhere. The prosecutor would
not say where his investigation was going. And the Americans, also
reluctant to disclose sensitive information, could not help him.</TE>
<TE>   SEPT. 11</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence Reports Alarmed Authorities</TE>
<TE>   After months of dead ends and missed opportunities, the shock of
Sept. 11 rekindled the American campaign against Bout.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities were alarmed by intelligence reports that Bout
crews serviced Ariana planes in Sharjah. They knew that the Taliban
had allowed Bin Laden to charter Ariana planes, but they were unsure
of Bout's connection to the airline. "Except for the maintenance
work, we lost the trail after 1996," one official said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the post 9/11 atmosphere," a former NSC aide said, "that was
enough to dramatically escalate interest." NSC officials pressed
federal investigators for a renewed effort.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military analysts found vast Al Qaeda and Taliban munitions
caches ringing the runways at Kandahar airport. Finding the source
has become a high priority.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks after the terrorist attacks, a Kenyan mine owner approached
the FBI in Brussels hinting that he could offer information about
Bout's ties to the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The FBI flew the mine owner,
Sanjivan Ruprah, to Washington three times. A U.S. source familiar
with the meetings said Ruprah failed to impress.</TE>
<TE>   But Belgian authorities arrested him in February on suspicion of
conspiring to print counterfeit Congolese currency. Ruprah became the
first Bout associate to be taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, the Belgians moved against Bout. A federal prosecutor
issued an arrest warrant, alleging that Bout headed a complex scheme
to launder African weapons profits. Interpol followed with a
worldwide alert.</TE>
<TE>   This was the action the Americans had urged during their visit the
year before. According to Belgian law enforcement officials, the
police investigation into Bout led to the discovery of a massive flow
of money coursing through two Bout-controlled firms: Air Charter
Center, a Brussels aviation firm, and Vial, the Delaware firm that
sold Antonovs to the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   A Belgian law enforcement official said that "several hundred
million in Belgian francs" moved into bank accounts across Europe.
The funds, a U.S. official said, allegedly came from Angolan weapons
profits.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. investigator Peleman uncorked a bottle of champagne after he
learned about the warrant.</TE>
<TE>   But Bout, it turned out, was still beyond the reach of the law.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. had assumed that he would be in the Emirates if a warrant
came down. Instead, he was in Moscow, where authorities would not
arrest him on the basis of an Interpol alert.</TE>
<TE>   After years of shying away from publicity, Bout was suddenly
accessible. He swept into a Moscow radio station defending himself as
a simple dealer in "supply transportations."</TE>
<TE>   A flurry of news accounts suggesting that he had dealings with the
Taliban and Al Qaeda were "monstrous," he said. He belittled his
American pursuers. They seethed in Washington. "There was a lot of
egg on faces when Bout went on the radio," a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   In Brussels, a dispirited Belgian diplomat recalled America's
promises to help bring Bout to justice. "I think we will need a
little pressure from Washington" for Bout's extradition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But even as some NSC and State Department officials argued that
Bout was a priority, Russia was also a key ally in the war against
terrorism. A tug of war over Bout might damage that new relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very limited in what we can do," a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian Interior Ministry has looked into the Belgian charges.
"If there were evidence, I think Interpol would offer it," diplomat
Kabulov said. He added, "This country is probably the safest place
for him now."</TE>
<TE>   But Bout was still rumored to be on the move.</TE>
<TE>   In late February, Greek intelligence received a tip that he was
flying through the Athens airport on a commercial jet. Greek police
later told their Belgian counterparts that agents filed onto the jet
with arrest papers, but the passenger they sought was not aboard.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps he was on another stage of the voyage," said Jos Colpin,
an official with the Belgian public prosecutor's office in Brussels.
"But with Bout, who ever knows?"</TE>

<LD>Irvine public schools got some encouraging but mixed news this month.
Private donations amounting to $1.3 million will make continued
class-size reductions possible in some of the lower grades. However,
the inevitable budget cuts that still must be carried out as the
district tries to make ends meet will cost dozens of teachers their
jobs.</LD>
<LD>   While some of this news is bad, Irvine's success in fund-raising
shows that it remains one of the few lucky ones. Several years ago,
the Donald Bren Foundation came forward to preserve art and science
programs with a hefty donation. Irvine is a city where new housing
developments sell out in a hurry because of its attraction as a place
to raise families. It has a broad parent base and a core of business
supporters who value education.</LD>
<LD>   How many others can rely on wealthy benefactors, committed parents
and even an assist from the city government to make up the difference
when the going gets tough? As much as this is about one district's
successful rally, it is also an ominous warning that less affluent
public districts may suffer most if the state's budget crisis
deepens. What will happen to Santa Ana as ambitious programs must
give way to fiscal realities? Certainly parents in less affluent
areas have no less desire to see their children get the best.</LD>
<TE>   The budget crunch in Irvine and other districts is in some ways
the story of how the suburban dream can be jeopardized by cracks in
its fiscal underpinnings. The state's multibillion-dollar budget
shortfall has put a lot of pressure on districts everywhere. Irvine
has shown that it can meet the test, but it is hard to imagine too
many other public school systems in the county or region in which
parents would say, as one reportedly did during the recent
fund-raising campaign, "Just double mine."</TE>
<TE>   Other affluent areas in Orange County are now facing tough
choices. Should they make do with less or dig deep and pay extra?
Capistrano Unified faces millions in cuts, potential layoffs and
delays in construction of school facilities. Parents in Saddleback
Valley Unified have rallied just as Irvine parents have, but even as
their district faces staff cuts, there is concern about the future of
some programs. Nor is Irvine out of the woods by any means. The
largess closes the budget gap for the short term, but the long-range
prospects of retaining smaller classes in the critical early years
will still be a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   While many of the families who live in these districts are
affluent on a relative scale, lots have made it in on a shoestring
family budget, scraping together a down payment with the help of
family and then curbing their entertainment and vacation budgets. The
imposition of parcel taxes, previously rejected in Irvine, now may
have to be revived there and/or implemented in some form elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The translation is: Taxes may have to go up to keep quality high.
What long has been a system of public education in suburbs now is
taking on some of the earmarks of a tuition plan, called by another
name. Administrators, parents and officials from the local districts
to Sacramento must recognize that the game is about paying somehow or
losing favored programs. These aren't pleasant choices, but they call
for a robust debate on the very aims of public education.</TE>

<LD>Re "Don't Renew Sewage Treatment Waiver," Editorial, May 5:</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Sanitation District is not, as you stated,
largely "self-monitored," nor do we have latitude in what we
communicate to the public. We are, in fact, highly regulated. Our
waste-water collection, treatment and disposal operations are closely
monitored and regulated by state and federal agencies, including the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board and the South Coast Air Quality Management
District.</LD>
<LD>   We agree with The Times that we can do a better job of
communicating with the public. Over the years we have held meetings
and workshops, conducted tours and open houses, distributed
newsletters, addressed civic and volunteer groups, participated in
the Orange County Fair, met one-on-one with people and posted
information on our Web site.</LD>
<TE>   The 20-meter study that was conducted in 1996, and which was the
subject of your editorial, tracked treated waste water released
offshore. The sanitation district invited residents, environmental
groups and regulators to an August 1997 meeting with district staff
to discuss results of the offshore bacterial study. An oral report on
the study was presented at the meeting, which was attended by
representatives of the California Regional Water Quality Control
Board and others. The issue was addressed without concern by
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   District staff members are always available to meet with residents
and business owners to answer questions about how we process and
release treated waste water more than four miles offshore and to give
an overview of our 25-year ocean monitoring program. Anyone who has
questions or who would like to speak with me or my staff should call
(714) 962-2411 to set up an appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Our mission is to protect public health and the environment
through responsible waste water management. We do this with a sense
of responsibility to the 2.4 million people we serve and to the
regulatory agencies that govern us.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Huntington Beach Stretch Opens After Month Off-Limits," May
10:</TE>
<TE>   Since the Orange County Sanitation District's board of directors'
meeting April 24, 4.8 billion gallons of partially treated sewage
have been discharged into the Pacific off Huntington Beach. More than
2 billion gallons received advanced primary treatment. Four billion
gallons of sewage discharged in 17 days--and sanitation district
experts don't have the slightest idea what's causing the bacteria
forcing beach closings.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook is right when she says the
discharge from the sanitation district's outfall pipe is part of the
beach contamination problem. The lack of rain in Orange County this
spring reduces the validity of an urban runoff argument, and the
beach cities have inspected sewer lines. The only thing that has not
changed is the sanitation district's sewage treatment protocol.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, a district director, has properly embraced the role and
responsibility of a city representative to the district.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Jewell</TE>
<TE>   Westminster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook's argument that
the discharge of 250 million gallons a day of partially treated
sewage by the Orange County Sanitation District may be the culprit in
Huntington Beach. There is plenty of evidence that the sewage plume
makes its way back toward the shoreline, despite being discharged 4.5
miles out to sea. When will the sanitation district wake up and hold
itself accountable? At least Orange County cities can see the
evidence staring them in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Just this last week, La Palma passed a resolution opposing the
waiver that allows the sanitation district to get away with this
malfeasance. Thanks to La Palma Mayor Paul F. Walker for taking the
initiative and leaving a legacy for his children. We need more cities
to have his vision.</TE>

<LD>Re "Board OKs Strip Mall at Cook's Corner," May 8:</LD>
<LD>   Your article on the Board of Supervisors approving the commercial
center at Cook's Corner was accurate, but our firm has represented
the developer and I would like to clarify the following:</LD>
<LD>   The project's commercial zoning continues to be questioned, even
though the Board of Supervisors approved the zoning in 1997. Three
years of litigation that challenged the board's vote and the adequacy
of the environmental impact report--which went all the way to the
California Supreme Court--resulted in the validation of the county's
actions. The Cook's Corner intersection draws 7,000 to 12,000 daily
trips by vehicles. A small commercial center is the best use for this
site.</LD>
<TE>   This project represents a careful balance between the rural
character of the area, the environmental resources on the site and a
reasonable use of Live Oak's land.</TE>
<TE>   Close to 15 acres of Live Oak's 23 acres at Cook's Corner are
being preserved as permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   W. Dean Brown</TE>
<TE>   President,  Planning Consortium</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So what else is new? The Board of Supervisors has never seen a
development it didn't like--and the uglier the better. Drive around
Orange County and see how easy it is to pick out developments that
were approved by the board. If the houses are crowded together and
all you can see is roofs, then you know it is one of their projects.
I can't understand why we name anything in Orange County after a
supervisor except maybe a garbage dump.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Keithahn</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano</TE>

<TE>   Please tell the residents of Trabuco Canyon who are mourning the
approval of a shopping mall at Cook's Corner that all they have to do
is not buy gas at the filling station, not drop off film at the photo
shop, not pick up prescriptions at the pharmacy and not shop in the
gift shop. Tell them not to support any of the new businesses. Then
the mall will die and the residents will have the ultimate revenge.</TE>
<TE>   I predict that residents will enjoy the convenience of the
shopping area. All the fighting will die out as the locals discover
they have an easy place to drop off their dry-cleaning.</TE>

<HD>CPAs Find Correa's Facts Don't Add Up</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "State Needs to Rein In Accountants," Commentary, May 5:</LD>
<LD>   I was disappointed to read the serious inaccuracies included in
the opinion piece written by Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim). He
says stockbrokers can own an interest in California accounting firms.
This is misleading. The law he refers to was designed to keep
unrelated businesses from taking over accounting firms, and contains
a number of safeguards to this effect. As such, a stockbroker would
never own an interest in a CPA firm.</LD>
<LD>   Correa also suggests that self-regulation has failed. This is also
false. The profession has worked diligently to pursue state, national
and self-regulation that is meaningful, effective and in the public
interest. Mandatory peer review, continuing education and state and
national regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
other agencies demonstrate that the profession is highly regulated.</LD>
<TE>   We are committed to restoring faith in our profession and the
financial marketplace, and our state association, CalCPA, supports
the creation of an independent panel to oversee the profession's role
and responsibilities in performing audits of public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Lastly, I disagree with the assemblyman's state-by-state approach
to his accounting proposals. A hodgepodge of conflicting state and
federal regulations would create enormous public confusion. Investors
would not be served if they were confronted with questions about
whether auditors complied with special and disparate rules adopted by
California, New York, Maine, Arkansas or other states.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Wheeler, CPA</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The recent op-ed piece by Assemblyman Lou Correa contained false
and misleading information. Professional audit standards and public
expectation demand that auditors be independent and objective. This
is a responsibility taken seriously by auditors and their firms. Our
reputations and livelihood depend on it.</TE>
<TE>   Correa was wrong when he wrote that stockbrokers can own an
interest in California accounting firms, something that would create
an obvious conflict of interest. California law contains many
safeguards to ensure that non-accounting entities cannot take over an
accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Correa accused accountants of refusing to participate in the
reform process. Nothing could be further from the truth. Legislators
have received hundreds of letters from California-based CPAs on a
variety of bills being considered. Dozens of CPAs have traveled to
Sacramento to testify at hearings where Correa was present.</TE>
<TE>   The California Society of Certified Public Accountants has been
working to help craft effective reforms at the national level that
would restore faith in our profession and the financial marketplace.
It appears Correa is less interested in reform and more interested in
political posturing.</TE>

<LD>   I have a fairer solution than burdening the 241 and 261 tollway
customers with the costs of the 73 toll road. The 73 was built solely
to allow development of Newport Coast. Without a major access road,
this area would have had very low density. The beneficiaries of the
73 construction should make up the revenue shortfalls.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine Co., the builders, or the homeowners should be assessed
a special fee or yearly tax to pay back the 73 bonds.</LD>

<LD>Re "Columnist Is Right: Kline Should Resign," Letters, May 12:</LD>
<LD>   Whittier Law School professor Mario W. Mainero Jr. said the Orange
County Bar Assn. "didn't do its job" by not evaluating the write-in
challengers to Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline.
Mainero penned his letter without learning the facts: Time
constraints made an evaluation impossible.</LD>
<LD>   The list of judicial candidates was set by the registrar of voters
Dec. 10. The bar had prepared a draft of its questionnaire ballot
form by Dec. 21. The printed forms, cover letter and envelopes were
mailed to about 7,000 bar members Jan. 14, and the committee's
ratings were released Feb. 26, just days before the March 5 election.
The process included interviews with the candidates and with lawyers,
judges and others who were in a position to evaluate the candidates.</LD>
<TE>   The write-in situation was different. Write-in candidates had to
submit signatures to become certified by the registrar. The deadline
was Feb. 19, just 14 days before the election. The registrar
certified 11 write-in candidates, but there was no time to mail 7,000
questionnaires, retrieve and tabulate them, identify and investigate
references and interview 11 candidates. In a perfect world, it would
have been nice; in the real world, it was impossible.</TE>

<LD>Re "Thinking Outside Big-Box Zoning," April 29:</LD>
<LD>   In the summer of 2000 I traveled with the Cypress Masterworks
Chorale to Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland, where we performed
in beautiful churches, soaring cathedrals, ancient castles and even
quaint little pubs. We sang sacred and secular music representing
Cypress College and the city of Cypress. They loved our hymns and
gospel spirituals such as "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" and classic
American tunes like "Route 66."</LD>
<LD>   My overseas tour was an experience I will never forget. I was an
ambassador representing the United States, California and Cypress. I
will also never forget how my soul and spirit soared, singing in
those echo-filled cathedrals. God was present in those moments. His
spirit was almost palpable.</LD>
<TE>   So what do I tell my friends now in Ireland when they want to
visit Cypress? Do I tell them that we don't support churches where
people can sing freely to God, that Cypress turned down the
opportunity to have a beautiful church in their community that would
hold up to 4,000 people?</TE>
<TE>   Cypress' opposition to Cottonwood Christian Center means opposing
a cultural asset. Cypress will be enhanced and glorified by the
church that we intend to build and by the joy and beauty it will
bring to the citizens.</TE>

<LD>Re "Donations to Maintain K-3 Class-Size Limits in Irvine," May 8:</LD>
<LD>   It is a widespread misconception that kindergarten classes in
Irvine are (or will be) limited to 20 children. Kindergarten classes,
which are 200 minutes long, have a maximum of 33 students with two
teachers for half of that time, and spend the remaining 100 minutes
in groups of 16 or 17 with one teacher. On rare occasions, a
kindergarten class will have 20 pupils with one teacher for the
entire 200 minutes. This situation will not change next year, which
is why many parents who moved to Irvine for the schools are enrolling
their children in private schools that offer more hours of
instruction and smaller class sizes.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "O.C. Judge Faces Review," May 8:</LD>
<LD>   The criticism of the manner in which Judge James O. Perez
processed the "finger burn" case leads me to defend Perez. The cry to
hang the judge is not justified. Perez's decision, with the probation
supervision and the $100 fine, carries a message that is meaningful
to a working man.</LD>
<LD>   Perez served the court system in Orange County for 20 years before
retirement. Since retirement he has taken assignments to help carry
the load of the understaffed courts. He should be applauded, not
condemned.</LD>
<TE>   Walter W. Charamza</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am outraged by the $100 fine that was imposed on Wellington Soto
for burning his son's hand as punishment for stealing a package of
gum. What can we do to see that Perez never sets foot in a courthouse
again?</TE>
<TE>   I am the mother of three grown children, a grandmother to five, a
college graduate with degrees in nursing and psychology and am a
Realtor. I point these things out to stress that I am exposed to
people from all walks of life. I have met many people of different
cultures, and I know that none would use this as a form of
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Is Soto of sound mind? This is such irrational thinking. God only
knows what the next form of punishment might be. This is child abuse
any way you spell it. The father should have been sentenced to jail
and this child should be placed in a loving home.</TE>

<LD>Re: "Air War's Next Likely Target: John Wayne," May 13:</LD>
<LD>   El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon and the Air Transportation Assn.'s
desire to terminate flight restrictions at John Wayne Airport should
make every resident of Newport Beach question the leadership of their
city officials. After all, it was the Newport Beach City Council,
along with the Airport Working Group based out of Newport Beach, that
overturned Measure F in the courts, acting under the badly mistaken
belief that an airport at El Toro could be forced on a disapproving
electorate. I know because I was the official proponent of Measure F.</LD>
<LD>   Now that El Toro is but a memory, those in Newport Beach would
have been protected against an expansion at John Wayne by Measure F,
as it is a virtual certainty that two-thirds of Orange County voters
would never have approved the expansion. The lesson here: Be careful
what you wish for.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Illegal Immigrants' Best Form of ID Is Ingenuity," May 12:</LD>
<LD>   The Times' article seems to laud illegal immigrants. You describe
how a family is able to hold jobs, own a car--though with no driver's
license and auto insurance--own a house and buy furniture. Untold
numbers of illegal immigrants are undercutting an orderly society by
manipulating the system in the same manner as the Rodriguez family.</LD>
<LD>   Gustavo Rodriguez is paid in cash, so he pays no worker's
compensation, Social Security or income tax. Who does he think is
paying for the services his family receives? How many laws has this
family broken with its strategy of living in our society illegally?</LD>
<TE>   I am tired of being told that these are just hard-working people
who want the American dream, and that they pay more into the system
in taxes than they use. This article puts an end to that big lie.</TE>
<TE>   On the same page was an article that states the swelling
California budget gap leaves Gov. Davis with few options except to
raise taxes for law-abiding and taxpaying citizens. If there is a
growing segment of our population that pays no taxes, it does not
take a genius to conclude that our taxes will be increased.</TE>

<LD>Re "More Hospitals Can Use Angioplasty, Study Finds," April 17:</LD>
<LD>   The findings published in the Journal of the American Medical
Assn. demonstrate that heart attack patients who get immediate access
to angioplasty have fewer strokes and recurrent heart attacks than
patients treated initially with medications, especially anticoagulant
therapy (TPA). The article also described a "two-tiered system" that
exists in Orange County in which cardiac emergencies are take to the
nearest hospital by paramedics.</LD>
<LD>   When we developed the Orange County Emergency Medical System in
the 1970s ( I was a principal architect), all that was required in a
cardiac center was an intensive-care unit and a cardiologist. Thus
every receiving hospital in the emergency system became a cardiac
center.</LD>
<TE>   Technology has exploded since then, and there are several
excellent cardiac facilities in Orange County, yet cardiac
emergencies are still taken to the nearest hospital. I have been the
unfortunate victim of this situation on two occasions. Heart attack
victims are being taken to a community hospital, and after much time
is lost, are transported to a cardiac center for definitive
evaluation and treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The time is long past for the county's Emergency Medical Care
Committee to establish criteria and designate cardiovascular
emergency centers, and to develop criteria for the diversion of
cardiovascular emergencies by the base stations to those centers.</TE>

<LD>Jenny Bioche should spend fewer Fridays at Fashion Island with the
"haves" of south Orange County and do more investigation into sexual
child abuse, whether committed by parents, family members, educators,
baby-sitters or clergy.</LD>
<LD>   To suggest that teachers and parents were asleep at the wheel
because they should have known is ludicrous. Rape victims hesitate
coming forward, and battered women hold their tongues ... yet she
expects children to speak out?</LD>
<LD>   I, too, am a proud Roman Catholic. I have never felt stereotyped
or that my religion was unfavorably portrayed. Bioche can bury her
head in the sands of the Atrium at Fashion Island and refuse to
believe that far too many priests are predators and that bishops
covered up for them. The sheer numbers, admissions and documentation
that predatory priests were moved from parish to parish speak for
themselves.</LD>
<TE>   I have not yet determined how I feel about priests marrying. But
for Bioche to suggest that you must choose one profession, similar to
deciding whether to be a doctor or lawyer because you can't do both,
is silly. Are the successful doctors and lawyers who are married
considered dual-professionals?</TE>
<TE>   If the church is brought to its knees in the search for truth and
justice, perhaps it belongs there. It has much to repent for.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Lynch</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Bioche puts the capital A in Apologetics. She epitomizes the
Roman Catholic Church's head-in-the-sand approach to solving
problems. The church is fortunate in not having Bioche as legal
counsel, for she'd dig it into a deeper mess.</TE>
<TE>   Especially choice is her assertion that " ... I don't believe
there was the intent to endanger children; I think the church didn't
know how to handle it." What most people do when they don't know how
to "handle" something is to hire an expert. They shouldn't have swept
it under the rug for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   I don't believe the church had any intention of endangering
children, but in its attempt at self-preservation, children--lots of
them--became victims. Bioche also displayed a puzzling lack of
knowledge about her own church by stating that "allowing priests to
marry can be problematic." Evidently, she is unaware that married
priests do exist in the Catholic Church. In the Eastern Rite, which
is loyal to and in communion with Rome, priests may marry prior to
ordination, and the Catholic Church accepted dozens of disaffected
former Episcopal priests in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Both classes of married priests perform parochial duties, and I
know of no reports or studies indicating these priests are less
effective than their celibate peers. If removing the celibacy ban
increased the abysmally low number of men entering the priesthood,
the married priests would make up in numbers what they may lack in
terms of availability.</TE>

<LD>Re "Rail Issues Lack Easy Fixes," Editorials, May 5:</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to what your editorial states, high-speed rail will do
little to relieve traffic congestion. Traffic is caused by too many
commuters driving between their homes and jobs, not by vacationers
traveling through the dairy farms and pistachio groves along
Interstate 5 between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Spending $25
billion, or $35 million per mile, on a rail system of questionable
benefit is insane. Dedicating the resources to developing, upgrading,
and expanding urban, commuter-oriented transit systems, such as
Metrolink, will do far more to relieve traffic problems and improve
quality of life than high-speed rail ever will.</LD>

<LD>Re "Lack of Housing for the Disabled Alarms Groups," April 14:</LD>
<LD>   Your story stated that "although there is no official count of how
much housing is available for the disabled, none has been built in at
least five years." This reflects a lack of civic responsibility for a
group that has the least options for accessible housing. A similar
situation exists in San Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, most people think that since the Americans With
Disabilities Act was signed 12 years ago, all the problems for this
population were taken care of by providing a few reserved parking
spaces. As baby boomers retire, they will be disappointed if they
think they will find housing suitable for limited mobility that often
accompanies old age.</LD>

<LD>Victor Bout is fluent in five languages and is described by intimates
as a tough but charming man and a hard bargainer.</LD>
<LD>   Bout's business dealings have enabled him to buy expensive cars
and residences in Moscow, on the Belgian coast and in South Africa
and the emirate of Sharjah.</LD>
<LD>   He has left several countries one step ahead of official inquiries
into his businesses and has been accused by United Nations and U.S.
officials of supplying weapons to regimes around the world.</LD>
<TE>   After the 1990 collapse of the Soviet Union, Bout began leasing
and buying old Soviet planes.</TE>
<TE>   Bout has worked both for governments and for the forces that seek
to overthrow them, including Afghanistan's Taliban regime and the
opposition Northern Alliance. According to U.S. officials, he even
picked up six freed hostages from the Philippines for Libya's Col.
Moammar Kadafi.</TE>
<TE>   Although Belgian officials issued a warrant for his arrest in
February, Bout was last seen in Moscow.</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: Associates say Victor Bout, left, exudes charm and
swagger. In making deals, Bout--who allegedly delivered weapons to
governments and rebels--cultivated the powerful and went after
business that others rejected.</CP>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Army said one of its gunship aircraft had killed about 10
people in a new operation against remnants of Al Qaeda and Taliban
forces, but it rejected a report that the crew had mistaken
celebratory gunfire for an attack.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a 1,000-strong force led by British Royal Marines was
airlifted to the turbulent Paktia-Khowst region for Operation Condor,
aimed at hunting down a "substantial" force of suspected Al Qaeda and
Taliban militants in the area, a coalition spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. warplanes and helicopters took off from Bagram air base, the
headquarters of the U.S.-led coalition, throughout Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "We have gone out in support. If we come across Al Qaeda, we will
engage. We are searching," Royal Marines spokesman Lt. Col. Ben Curry
told reporters at the allied headquarters inside Bagram, north of
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani-based Afghan Islamic Press agency reported Friday
that U.S. planes had pounded Bul Khil village in Khowst province for
several hours Thursday night, after a U.S. helicopter crew mistook
traditional firing at a wedding for an attack.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. Army spokesman Maj. Bryan Hilferty said the air attack
was launched after coalition forces came under fire from suspected
Islamic militants belonging to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network or
their Taliban allies.</TE>
<TE>   "About 10 people were killed in Thursday night's bombing on an
uninhabited ridge line," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the report about the wedding is all wrong.... We
believe this is an Al Qaeda and Taliban area. There were people on
the ridge line who fired heavy weapons on an Australian patrol and
then chased them. We have a right to self-defense."</TE>

thousands of cheering youngsters but read only a few lines of his
speech before deferring to an aide.</LD>
<LD>   John Paul looked tired during the brief marking of the day in a
Vatican auditorium, where a youth band played "Happy Birthday."</LD>
<LD>   Ushers wheeled the pope into and out of the room on a platform.</LD>
<TE>   A hand tremor, slurred speech and difficulty walking--symptoms of
Parkinson's disease--have plagued the pope for years, and doctors
have told him to conserve his strength whenever he can.</TE>

Azerbaijan and Bulgaria.</TE>

<LD>Acting on fears of bioterrorism, the 191 World Health Organization
members formally reversed a long-standing order for the destruction
of all smallpox virus stocks and recommended that they be retained
for research into new vaccines or treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The World Health Assembly, the United Nations health agency's top
decision-making body, decided to drop a 2002 deadline for destroying
the virus, held at top-security laboratories in the United States and
Russia.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. health official at the Geneva meeting said smallpox
research was needed because Sept. 11 showed how far terrorists would
go.</LD>

<HD>A War-Torn Village Finds No Sanctuary</HD>
<DH>Colombia: Army knew of a looming rebel battle but didn't
act. As many as 119 civilians perished.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BELLAVISTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>They came seeking sanctuary. Instead, they found death.</LD>
<LD>   About 300 villagers crowded into St. Paul the Apostle Church here
two weeks ago to escape a battle between leftist rebels and
right-wing paramilitary fighters that raged around this muddy
riverfront town.</LD>
<LD>   As they huddled inside, they cried and sang and prayed for
deliverance. And then, a little after 10 a.m. on May 2, they heard a
thump and a long, moaning whistle.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, the ceramic tile roof shattered and an explosion ripped
through the church. The rebels had launched a homemade mortar, its
path tragically awry.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an indescribable sound, like nothing I have ever heard
before," said Diofanor Romana, 26, who was sitting in the rectory
next door when the bomb hit. "Everywhere there was blood. Some people
had no hands. Some people were crawling away with no legs."</TE>
<TE>   The blast resulted in the worst single-day massacre of civilians
in decades in Colombia's long and bloody civil war, killing as many
as 119 people, including 46 children. More than 100 people were
injured.</TE>
<TE>   The mortar that turned the tiny concrete church into a human
slaughterhouse underscores several terrible new trends in Colombia's
four-decade internal conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Since the collapse of peace talks this year, the war has
increasingly become a contest between two giant clandestine armies:
the leftist guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, and the right-wing paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces
of Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   The two forces have grown considerably in recent years, thanks to
drug trade profits, and are becoming more closely matched in both
arms and men. Just last week, scores of paramilitary fighters and
rebels were killed in a battle in northwestern Colombia, about 100
miles east of Bellavista.</TE>
<TE>   As the two groups have repeatedly clashed, the Colombian army has
shown an inability to intervene, despite millions of dollars in U.S.
aid designed to increase the military's ability to quickly reach
far-flung battle sites.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials were warned about the possibility of an attack
near Bellavista a week before by the government's top human rights
official. After the killings, it took five days to get to the town,
by which time the combatants had fled and the residents were burying
their dead.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to outrage over the slow response, top military
officials said that such warnings are too common and too imprecise to
merit a response from an army stretched thin by combat. There are
only 1,000 soldiers stationed in the 10,000-square-mile region that
includes Bellavista.</TE>
<TE>   But in the weeks since the massacre, fresh evidence has emerged
that the military was not so much doubtful about the warning's
veracity, but simply unable or unwilling to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Military intelligence quickly confirmed the civilian report of
impending trouble. And the night before the attack began, the
military obtained infrared images of rebel forces massing just
outside the town but decided against airstrikes or a troop invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to do movements in this area," said Col. Juan
Alfonso Bautista, a local military official.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the massacre in Bellavista shows that as Colombia's
violence spirals to ever greater levels, those most likely to pay the
price are the rural poor, abandoned by a distant central government
to the depredation of vicious private militias.</TE>
<TE>   Bellavista today is a haunted place, empty of people and filled
with the stench of death. The church is destroyed, the sacristy is
shattered.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't be safe in a church, then where can you be safe?"
asked Father Antun Ramos, who was injured by shrapnel as he witnessed
the destruction of his flock. "It's a horrible choice. You either die
in your home or you die in your church."</TE>
<TE>   Prelude</TE>
<TE>   The Atrato River is a wide, muddy thoroughfare that snakes more
than 200 miles through the thick rainforest of Choco, one of
Colombia's poorest, meanest and most forgotten provinces.</TE>
<TE>   There are only three colors in this flat, humid region, which
boasts the second-heaviest rainfall on Earth: the green jungle, the
brown river and the gray, overcast sky.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the descendants of black Spanish slaves eke out a living,
fishing and farming in scattered river communities of about 50 wood
huts without electricity or running water, hemmed in by the jungle.</TE>
<TE>   The region is attractive for one reason: transportation. The river
is a key corridor for smuggling out the cocaine that fuels Colombia's
multi-front war--and smuggling in the chemicals needed to manufacture
it and the guns needed to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, rebels seized control of the middle section of the
river, blowing up the church and police station in Vigia del Fuerte,
a town just across the river from Bellavista. Twenty-four policemen
were killed. The town, like nearly 200 others in Colombia, was left
without a police force.</TE>
<TE>   In April, paramilitary fighters decided to win it back. About 400
men made their way upriver, apparently passing through several
military checkpoints. The Colombian military has frequently been
accused of cooperating with paramilitary forces, because both are
battling the leftist guerrillas as a common enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitary fighters arrived by boat in Vigia del Fuerte on
April 21, calling residents together at a meeting. "They said not to
worry, that they weren't going to harm any civilians," Romana said.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas were taken by surprise. Their ranks had been
thinned by fighting nearby with local Colombian army units, who were
trying to rescue the governor of a nearby province who had been
kidnapped by the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas immediately placed a blockade on the river, cutting
off food and fuel to strangle the paramilitary fighters. They
attacked Noah's Ark, a tug that makes its way up and down the river
to deliver food to the communities once a month.</TE>
<TE>   The events were enough to alarm Eduardo Cifuentes, the country's
top human rights defender. On April 24, he issued an alert, warning
of a possible clash in the area. His office has issued 44 such
warnings this year, he said, about one every three days.</TE>
<TE>   But Gen. Mario Montoya told reporters later that the armed forces
cannot respond to every such alert. He said recent operations had
overextended the military.</TE>
<TE>   "The capacity of the armed forces is being reduced each day due to
the number of missions we take on," Montoya told reporters when he
arrived in Bellavista on May 8.</TE>
<TE>   But if there were doubts, military intelligence had backed up
Cifuentes' report by April 26, confirming the presence of the two
sides in the general area around Bellavista. And on the night before
the attack began May 1, an air force plane captured infrared images
of a mass of fighters gathering just outside Bellavista.</TE>
<TE>   Bautista, the local military official, said the navy sent an armed
troop transport ship up the Atrato River. But it simply took a long
time to get to the site, about 105 miles south of the Gulf of Uraba.</TE>
<TE>   The air force, he said, rejected a bombing mission because the
guerrillas were too close to the town. And the army could not land
troops because flooding had left the airstrip in Vigia del Fuerte
covered by nearly three feet of water.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was flooded up to six feet deep," Bautista said. "It
was too difficult to move in."</TE>
<TE>   The people of Bellavista were left alone to face the violence.</TE>
<TE>   The Attack</TE>
<TE>   Bellavista is a tiny town, perhaps 1,000 people. Most are
descended from a handful of families. It's a place where everyone is
related to everyone else and fear spreads like a lighted fuse from
home to home.</TE>
<TE>   When the bullets started flying early May 1, most of those in the
northern part of town headed for the church, one of the few buildings
with concrete walls.</TE>
<TE>   More and more people began to crowd inside as an estimated 800
guerrillas exchanged gunfire with the 400 paramilitary fighters.
There was fear, but most felt safe inside.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody thought that a bomb was going to hit," said Rosa Mercedes
Caicedo, 19, whose 1-year-old daughter was injured in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the battle was going badly for the paramilitary fighters,
who were pushed into the center of town by rebels approaching from
high ground to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Rains had flooded the town, and the paramilitary fighters found
themselves trapped. They plunged into chest-high water, shooting from
beneath the wooden sidewalks that surround the basketball court in
the town's central square.</TE>
<TE>   Bullet holes that punched through tin roofs and wooden walls
testify to the ferocity of the combat. Those who were in the church
said that on the first day, the gunfire never seemed to stop.</TE>
<TE>   During the night, the guns quieted. Those inside huddled together
and slept fitfully. At dawn, the gunfire began again.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the paramilitary forces suffered injuries. Around 9
a.m., fighters bearing two injured men tried to enter the church. One
of the men was a paramilitary commander, known as Camilo. He was
bleeding badly.</TE>
<TE>   But civilians inside prevented the men from entering. So the
fighters sought refuge in the medical clinic that adjoins the church.</TE>
<TE>   There, Camilo spent his desperate last moments bleeding to death
on the floor of the clinic's labor room. Even today, a bloodstain the
size of a kitchen table coats the floor. Flies cover the walls.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 a.m., Father Ramos entered the church to calm down the
townspeople, who had become increasingly restive under the constant
barrage of gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Just after he had asked everyone to sit down, he heard a noise,
then a sound like the droning whistle of a train. The rebels had just
launched a homemade mortar, manufactured from propane gas cylinders,
from a soccer field about 150 yards to the north.</TE>
<TE>   The mortar came blasting through the roof, smashing into the
altar, around which many of the women and children had crowded.</TE>
<TE>   "It was horrible, terrible. The blow was so powerful. People were
running everywhere [outside the church] in water up to their necks,"
said Yenny Adriana Palacio, who lost two nieces in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   The devastation was astonishing.</TE>
<TE>   The church's tile roof shattered, sending shards as sharp as
knives raining down. The mortar was filled with shrapnel that went
flinging through the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The force of the blast blew through a wall and hurled several
people into the adjoining school. Some were decapitated. Others lost
arms or legs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was chaos. I was bleeding all over myself. There were
mutilated people everywhere, " Ramos said. "There was so much blood.
I totally lost control of the people."</TE>
<TE>   The church today is a silent witness to the mortar's profane work.
Pews are scattered and overturned. The walls behind the sacristy have
collapsed. But there are few holes in the walls, most of the shrapnel
having been absorbed by the bodies of the children and adults.</TE>
<TE>   Bits of flesh still cling here and there, covered with flies. A
young girl's braids, attached to what appears to be a small piece of
scalp, peek out from under the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   There is nobody to talk to in town. All have fled.</TE>
<TE>   Exodus</TE>
<TE>   In the moments after the bombing, chaos ensued. People ran in all
directions as gunfire continued. Most headed for a nearby convent of
Augustinian missionaries, a two-story concrete building about 70
yards away. There, nuns laid the dead and dying onto a floor, which
soon became slick with blood.</TE>
<TE>   As the battle continued, the priests feared that the guerrillas or
the paramilitary fighters would attack again. They consulted with the
townspeople and decided to risk flight across the river.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided we have to leave, or we will die," said Avelantonio
Chala, 35, who was among those gathered in the convent.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos, going first, tied a white rag to a pole and led a group of
about 150 people toward the bank of the river. The group chanted as
they walked.</TE>
<TE>   "Who are we?" Ramos asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We are civilians!" the people shouted back. "Don't shoot!"</TE>
<TE>   Father Antonio Mena led a second group, also behind a white flag.
The two groups mounted a small flotilla of the long, thin canoes used
to haul plantains and pineapples up and down the river.</TE>
<TE>   At last, around 2 p.m., about 200 survivors straggled across the
river to Vigia del Fuerte, exhausted, bleeding and in shock.</TE>
<TE>   In the days that followed, the villagers would return to the
church, placing the dead in plastic bags and ferrying them three
miles downriver to a high bank that stood above the floodwaters.</TE>
<TE>   There, in a mass grave about 10 feet by 10 feet, they buried their
loved ones in thick, red soil. They tied two sticks together to make
a cross.</TE>
<TE>   The exodus from the mid-Atrato River region has continued, with
boatloads of people from surrounding villages arriving daily in
Quibdo, the regional capital. More than 3,000 have descended on the
city in the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The military, which arrived on the scene five days after the
massacre, now controls Bellavista and Vigia del Fuerte, although
guerrillas can still be seen patrolling the river between those towns
and Quibdo, about 60 miles south.</TE>
<TE>   Locals and church officials said people are continuing to flee
because of worries about renewed combat. They said that paramilitary
fighters are now wandering openly in Vigia del Fuerte, mixing with
army soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Although those claims could not be verified, light-skinned men in
civilian clothes could be seen moving about the town Tuesday. Those
men stood out, because the region is populated mostly by dark-skinned
townspeople.</TE>
<TE>   Still, military officials denied that there was any intentional
cooperation, and they asked locals to come forward and identify the
suspected paramilitary members.</TE>
<TE>   "The paramilitaries are horrible to us. How could we cooperate
with such criminals? It's just that we don't know who is who," said
Maj. Juan Mauricio Prieto, an official with the local battalion. The
locals "don't tell us anything."</TE>
<TE>   There is still some skepticism among Colombian officials over the
final death toll, which was tallied by locals who stand to receive
benefits for the dead.</TE>
<TE>   So far, forensic investigators have pulled only 16 bodies from the
mass grave, although they suspended work after more rains turned the
grave into a bog. Ramos made an initial estimate of about 30 dead as
he fled the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nobody has come forward to contradict the list of dead,
which has been widely circulated in an attempt to find people who may
simply be missing.</TE>
<TE>   And so for now, Ramos says he is convinced that 119 were killed.
And something must be done, he said, in remembrance of them. "The
deed," he said, "cannot be forgotten."</TE>

<HD>South Korea's 'Love Hotels' Put Out the Welcome Mat for
World Cup Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUWON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>When soccer enthusiasts check into their motel rooms for the World
Cup games that begin next week, many will find beds with round
mattresses and wall art that runs to the risque.</LD>
<LD>   The Honeymoon Park Inn, Eros Motel, Love-In Park and Valentine
Motel are among the suggestively named lodgings being used during the
games, which will be jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan from May
31 to June 30.</LD>
<LD>   The explanation lies in simple arithmetic. South Korea is
expecting 650,000 World Cup visitors but has only 40,000 regular
hotel rooms for them. Tourism authorities have had to commission
about 4,000 smaller inns that are known colloquially as "love
hotels."</LD>
<TE>   "This is a place for couples who need some space for themselves,"
explains Chung Bung Jo, whose family runs the Eros Motel in Suwon,
where the U.S. team will play its first game June 5. He shows off a
scrupulously clean room, with a gilt-edged mirror facing a round
orange-leather bed. Complimentary toothbrushes and condoms are placed
neatly on the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating an influx of foreign tourists, the Eros has installed
a special telephone that connects to an interpretation hotline
supporting seven languages and has filled its tiny lobby with
brochures listing restaurants and attractions. "This is new to us.
None of our guests have ever requested these kinds of services,"
Chung says, explaining that his inn has never had foreign guests.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to clean up the image of the love hotels, the
country's Culture and Tourism Ministry has hung official-looking
plaques designating them as "World Inns." Motel managers have been
instructed in sanitation and etiquette and received decorating
advice.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us to put more tasteful art on the walls," says Lee
Jung Yeon, manager of the Romance Inn, where a black-and-white
photograph of a partially clad couple adorns a wall and rooms are
furnished with curiously shaped chairs that do not appear to be
designed for sitting. "They don't want the places to be vulgar."</TE>
<TE>   The use of the love hotels is a delicate subject, as South Koreans
are extraordinarily sensitive to how their country will appear during
the World Cup--especially since the games are being co-hosted with
archrival and former enemy Japan. Officials have planted flowers
along busy roads, renovated public toilets, commissioned cheerleading
squads and corrected English spelling mistakes in signs. They have
spent $2 billion to build soccer stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   Though the foreign visitors are expected to bring in revenue of
nearly $800 million, it is also feared that they could expose the
country to criticism or even ridicule. Under pressure from the
government, a group of dog-meat restaurant owners in Seoul recently
canceled plans to distribute free samples of their cuisine outside
the World Cup stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens outside the stadium is as important as what happens
inside. This is an opportunity to enhance our image," says Suwon
Mayor Sim Jae Duck, who expects 30,000 to 50,000 visitors to his
city--one of 10 South Korean venues for World Cup games. He says he
hopes that many of the newly converted "World Inns" can remain part
of the tourist infrastructure after the games are over.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government says no more than 2% of the hotels
being used for World Cup visitors are love hotels. That appears to be
the case in Seoul, which has many visitors. But a glance at the
motels in a smaller city such as Suwon, 20 miles south of the
capital, suggests that most of the accommodations are designed for
romantic trysts.</TE>
<TE>   Among the telltale signs are the basement parking lots with vinyl
curtains hung at the entrances to prevent nosy passersby from
spotting the cars. On a recent weekday afternoon, the only car parked
at the Eros Motel had a license plate that was covered with a board.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, maybe some Koreans are using these inns for purposes of love.
But regular travelers use them too. They are cheap and comfortable,"
says Choi Won Il, deputy director of the Culture and Tourism
Ministry. "Besides, any hotel can be a love hotel. It is the same in
every country."</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon of the love hotel is even better known in Japan
than in South Korea. It is a business that has found a niche in a
culture in which unmarried people usually live with their parents in
apartments that offer little privacy. The motels can be spotted along
any highway, some built like ersatz castles with wild architectural
flourishes; others are simple brick boxes clustered together on
discreet side streets in South Korean downtowns.</TE>
<TE>   Park Bong Gang, head of the Korean Lodging Assn., says the
prevalence of love hotels doesn't mean that life in South Korea is
more licentious. Quite to the contrary, he insists, "Korea is a moral
country that lives with Confucian values of respect and decency."</TE>
<TE>   "In America, people do it in cars or in the park. In Korea you
have to be very conscious about selecting a place to have sex," Park
says. "Although the rooms are rented hourly, they aren't used only
for sex. People do rent rooms to play mah-jongg or cards or to drink
with their friends."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, the motel owners are not wildly enthusiastic about
the onslaught of foreign tourists. Business is slow on weekdays, but
on weekends, they say, one room can be rented five times in a single
day (a room with a shower goes for about $23 and a room with a sauna
brings in $55). During the World Cup, rooms may not be rented by the
hour, which could mean a considerable loss for some motels.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally we are not happy about it," says one motel owner, who
asked not to be quoted by name. "We were asked by the city to take
reservations over the Internet. But we don't have a computer. We were
asked to be kind and polite to customers. But our type of inns don't
function in that way."</TE>

<HD>Kashmir Feud Troubles U.S.</HD>
<DH>Asia: As India expels the Pakistani ambassador and
thousands flee regional fighting, American officials seek to quell
tensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senior State Department officials are growing increasingly troubled
by deteriorating political conditions in South Asia, as India said
Saturday that it was expelling the Pakistani ambassador to New Delhi
and thousands of villagers fled fighting in the disputed Kashmir
region.</LD>
<LD>   "We have repeatedly stated our strong concerns about the potential
for conflict between India and Pakistan," Jo-Anne Prokopowicz, a
State Department spokeswoman, said Saturday. "We continue our
long-standing effort to lower tensions between India and Pakistan,
and encourage them to engage in a dialogue."</LD>
<LD>   The two nuclear-armed neighbors have long been at odds over
Kashmir, the Himalayan region split between them. Fighting in the
area escalated last week to its highest level this year, causing
officials in Washington as well as in South Asia to wonder whether
the area was again on the brink of all-out war.</LD>
<TE>   To try to calm matters, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke
in recent days by telephone with Indian and Pakistani government
leaders, Prokopowicz said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, Christina B. Rocca, assistant secretary of
State for South Asian affairs, returned Thursday from the area after
high-level attempts at mediating the growing crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States, including Secretary Powell, is very engaged in
this region," Prokopowicz said, adding that the nuclear capabilities
of both countries remained among the top U.S. concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for an official U.S. comment about the ouster of the
Pakistani ambassador to New Delhi, she said: "We're looking at the
macro picture. We are engaged and concerned, and we are hoping that
the Indian and Pakistani governments continue their open dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Kashmir has long been a political trouble spot between India and
Pakistan. India is mostly Hindu; Kashmir, like Pakistan, is
predominantly Muslim. India and Pakistan have fought two of their
three wars over the region.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee met Saturday with his
senior Cabinet ministers and intelligence officials in New Delhi,
trying to come up with a response to an attack on an army camp
Tuesday that killed more than 30 people. India blames the attack on
Pakistan-based Kashmiri separatists.</TE>
<TE>   After the sessions ended, the prime minister announced that
Pakistan's ambassador to India was being ordered out.</TE>
<TE>   In December, India pulled its ambassador from Pakistan after a
militant assault on the Parliament complex in New Delhi. Since then,
the rivals have cut back their diplomatic corps, halted airplane
flyovers and stopped rail service between the countries.</TE>
<TE>   With both sides facing off, Pakistan's ambassador to India, Ashraf
Jehangir Qazi, has remained in the Indian capital, even though Indian
government officials have declined to meet with him.</TE>
<TE>   But India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, said Saturday that
because India no longer has an ambassador in Pakistan, it was time
for the Pakistani ambassador to leave India "for the sake of parity
of representation between the two countries." Qazi was given one week
to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Singh was one of the Indian officials to whom Powell had been
reaching out in an attempt to ease tensions.</TE>
<TE>   In Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, a Foreign Ministry spokesman
told state-run television that the diplomatic expulsion would serve
only to increase ill feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "Actions like these add to tensions, whereas efforts should be
made to reduce tension," said the spokesman, Aziz Ahmed Khan.
"Pakistan, despite this action of India, which has disappointed us,
will continue to strive to resolve all issues with India through
peaceful negotiations and through peaceful means."</TE>
<TE>   Fighting along the frontier in Kashmir intensified Friday night
and Saturday, and an estimated 10,000 people were forced to flee
their homes as both sides used heavy artillery to pound selected
targets, Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   Separatists in Kashmir have been fighting for years for
independence from India or merger with Pakistan.</TE>

<HD>Irish Leader's Party Set to Win</HD>
<DH>Elections: The IRA's Sinn Fein also makes gains, including
a seat for a convicted gunrunner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN, Ireland</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's Fianna Fail party was on track today
for a sweeping victory--but just short of the predicted overall
majority--in a parliamentary election that also saw big gains for
Sinn Fein.</LD>
<LD>   Center-right Fianna Fail had won 71 of the 166 seats in the lower
house of Parliament by early today, with 23 results yet to be
declared. Some counting centers closed until later in the day.</LD>
<LD>   Though jubilant at his party's blistering performance, Ahern
dampened expectations that he would gain the 83 seats required for an
outright parliamentary majority. Lawmakers will convene June 6 to
reelect Ahern.</LD>
<TE>   Ahern, who can rely on a few sympathetic independents to boost his
numbers, said he would be happy to renew his outgoing coalition with
the smaller Progressive Democrats, who had so far secured four seats.</TE>
<TE>   The election, held Friday, has changed Ireland's political
landscape, as voters delivered a devastating blow to the main
opposition party, Fine Gael, and a significant breakthrough to Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.</TE>
<TE>   Fine Gael leader Michael Noonan said he would resign immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Sinn Fein, long shunned by the Dublin political establishment and
with just one member in the outgoing Parliament, has so far won five
seats, including one in the southwestern constituency of North Kerry,
won by convicted IRA gunrunner Martin Ferris.</TE>
<TE>   The party, which is dedicated to ending British rule in Northern
Ireland, has reinvented itself as a radical social crusader in the
Irish republic, focusing on issues such as drugs, crime and poverty,
and targeting the younger vote.</TE>
<TE>   Led by party President Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein activists roared
with joy as initial results announced in Dublin's urban
constituencies indicated that their candidates fared strongly.</TE>
<TE>   In North Kerry, Sinn Fein activists hefted Ferris onto their
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Ferris spent 10 years in a top-security Irish prison after being
caught in 1984 running guns to the IRA in a boat from Boston.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, Ferris was a key Sinn Fein negotiator in the
run-up to Northern Ireland's 1998 peace agreement, but security
sources and political opponents allege that he remains a senior
figure in the IRA.</TE>
<TE>   Ferris rejects the charge, saying he is dedicated to politics.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of North Kerry described the 50-year-old father of six
as a "hard man," tough on drugs and concerned about social issues.</TE>

<HD>Kim's Son Is Held in Graft Scandal</HD>
<DH>South Korea: The graduate student allegedly took $2 million
from a lobbyist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The youngest son of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung was arrested
Saturday night on charges that he took nearly $2 million from a
lobbyist in return for helping businesses win contracts.</LD>
<LD>   Although there has been no suggestion that the president is
implicated, the scandal is certain to tarnish the legacy of the Nobel
Peace Prize winner and to complicate Kim's efforts to advance peace
negotiations with North Korea during his last year in office.</LD>
<LD>   The youngest of three sons, 39-year-old Kim Hong Gul is a graduate
student who was working most recently as a researcher at Pomona
College. He lives in Rancho Palos Verdes in a house reported to have
cost $950,000, raising questions about how a student could afford
such a lavish lifestyle.</LD>
<TE>   The younger Kim voluntarily flew back to Seoul last week to face
questioning by prosecutors. He turned himself in Saturday night after
an arrest warrant was issued. South Korean television showed the
exhausted-looking man being taken to a Seoul detention center.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sorry to have caused concern to so many people. I am sorry
to my parents," he murmured to television reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The son's arrest caps a tumultuous scandal, complete with secret
tape recordings and shocking headlines, that has been swirling around
the president's family for months. The charges center on a business
relationship the younger Kim had with a Korean American lobbyist,
Choi Kyu Sun, who also has been arrested. According to a court
statement, the son received nearly $2 million in cash and stock from
the lobbyist to help various companies, including a sports-betting
company called Tiger Pools that was trying to obtain a national
lottery.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the president said today that the South Korean
leader is aware of the arrest but will continue to concentrate on
conducting official business.</TE>
<TE>   The president's second son, Kim Hong Up, also is under
investigation on allegations that he mishandled money that belonged
to a peace foundation set up by his father.</TE>
<TE>   There is a long tradition in South Korean politics of the children
of politicians being prosecuted for corruption, especially during
election years. Almost five years ago, the son of then-President Kim
Young Sam was summoned to the same prosecutors' office to face
similar corruption charges. The son, Kim Hyun Chul, was later
sentenced to two years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats say they expect more arrests and allegations as
the presidential campaign heats up. Under South Korean law, President
Kim cannot seek another five-year-term.</TE>
<TE>   The presidential election is to be held Dec. 19, with conservative
opposition leader Lee Hoi Chang running against Kim's ally, Roh Mu
Hyun.</TE>

<HD>Developers Bet on Macao as the Next Gambling Capital</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MACAO</DL>
<LD>When Macao's civic leaders announced plans last year to break up a
long-standing gambling monopoly and invite bids for three new casino
operating licenses, it was the first step toward a big dream.</LD>
<LD>   Their vision was simple but ambitious: Transform this sleepy,
slightly seedy gambling enclave into a glitzy gaming, convention and
tourist center--a Las Vegas East, an Asian Atlantic City.</LD>
<LD>   Macao's proximity to a huge potential market of Chinese gamblers
and the fact that most of the 10 million visitors who came last year
headed straight to the casinos made interest intense.</LD>
<TE>   A special government commission sifted through 18 proposals,
including ones from Donald Trump, MGM Mirage Inc. and a Monte Carlo
syndicate, before deciding in February on two of the biggest names on
the Las Vegas gaming scene: Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson.</TE>
<TE>   The third license went to the holder of Macao's existing gambling
monopoly, a flamboyant 80-year-old named Stanley Ho. A
larger-than-life character, Ho has been married four times, has 17
children, a personal fortune in the billions and a stake in just
about everything of real value in Macao.</TE>
<TE>   The selection has set up a classic battle between total opposites
for what could become one of the world's biggest gambling markets.</TE>
<TE>   On one side are a pair of experienced outsiders with impressive
track records of taking gambling mainstream. One Las Vegas casino
executive who knows both men described them as "two of the biggest
independent tigers in the world." On the other side is the ultimate
insider, a Chinese businessman whose knowledge and control of the
local scene give him enormous power.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how anyone can start a gambling business here without
dealing with Stanley," said longtime resident Warren Rooke, a local
businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn discovered that quickly enough. As the American started
negotiating for a prime spot of land to erect a $500-million resort,
he found himself across the table from the man who controlled it:
Stanley Ho.</TE>
<TE>   For all involved in Macao's transformation, the stakes are high.</TE>
<TE>   Macao, one of Europe's first colonial outposts in Asia, was ruled
by Portugal for more than four centuries until, like its bigger
neighbor Hong Kong, it reverted to Chinese rule 21/2 years ago.
Today, the wealth of China's newly rich is nowhere more visible than
around Macao's gambling tables. For those coming on organized tours,
the smallest gambling chip costs $12; the largest, $12,500.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a transforming moment in Macao's history," Wynn said in a
telephone interview from Las Vegas. "We're going to have a helluva
place there."</TE>
<TE>   Adelson was said to be unable to comment for this article because
of Securities and Exchange Commission rules that block public comment
during the refinancing period of his Las Vegas casino, the Venetian.</TE>
<TE>   For Ho, who at first fought the planned changes but now talks of
leading them, the battle brings genuine competition for the first
time since he purchased Macao's gambling monopoly 40 years ago. It's
been a lucrative business ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly through his principal holding company, best known by its
Portuguese initials STDM (Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes de Macao),
Ho today controls all 11 of Macao's casinos, its five-star hotels, a
major bank, the horse track, the dog track and a lucrative online
betting service. His money built Macao's new 1,100-foot-high
observation tower and its convention center. He is the largest
shareholder in the region's airline, Air Macao, as well as the new
airport. He owns the high-speed ferry service and a helicopter link
with Hong Kong that together bring the majority of Macao's visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, taxes from Ho's business interests account for about
60% of Macao's annual government revenues.</TE>
<TE>   For Macao, the dream isn't so much about survival as it is ending
an era. The move represents a fundamental shift for a quiet backwater
that lost its role as a main trading gateway to China well over a
century ago to Hong Kong. Macao has lived comfortably since then off
what one local dubbed "the three Gs"--gambling, graft and girls.</TE>
<TE>   Although the stakes in Ho's casinos are high, the slightly rough,
hard-edged ambience inside them is not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like being in a Greyhound bus station," said Rooke.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hong Kong, Macao enjoys the status of a special
administrative region within China and a similar quasi-autonomy from
Beijing. Its population of 450,000--one-fifteenth that of Hong
Kong--lives amid the rolling hills of a small peninsula and two tiny
islands that add up to just over 9 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   The main architect of Macao's vision for the future is its
dynamic, 47-year-old top political figure, Chief Executive Edmund Ho,
a Canadian-educated son of a respected local community leader. He is
no relation to Stanley Ho.</TE>
<TE>   Well into his third year on the job, he enjoys popularity ratings
between 70% and 80% because of his successes and his plans for the
future. Shortly after taking over, he cracked down on an epidemic of
gambling-linked violence that had given Macao an aura of Al
Capone-era Chicago. The region's most notorious gangster, known as
Broken-Tooth Koi, quickly ended up behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to broadening its gambling appeal, Macao plans a
$125-million Fisherman's Wharf tourist attraction replete with an
African fort and an erupting volcano. The government has also hired
New York-based Chinese architect I.M. Pei to design a science and
technology museum.</TE>
<TE>   Although the government leader restricts his media contacts to
occasional news conferences and rarely grants personal interviews, an
eager young team around him stresses that the changes are essential
to guarantee long-term prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely important," said Eric Ho, executive director of
Macao's Trade and Investment Promotion Institute, and no relation to
either Stanley or Edmund Ho. "If we can succeed, people not just in
greater China but elsewhere in the [East Asia] region will come to
see Macao as a destination in itself."</TE>
<TE>   The change is especially important to absorb the job losses
expected with the decline of Macao's second industry, textiles. The
enclave's export quotas, set by international agreement, are expected
to end in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Central to Macao's transformation is expanding its attraction
beyond the current hard-core, moneyed gamblers.</TE>
<TE>   "The high rollers have been very good for us, but if you look at
the Las Vegas model, it's easy to see the potential for developing
Macao as a family-oriented entertainment center," said Eric Ho, who
was also secretary of the casino license-tendering commission.</TE>
<TE>   The selections of Adelson and Wynn appear to fit Macao's
ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn, who arrived in Las Vegas as a liquor distributor, built his
empire on marketing flair and an instinct for what people want in
their free time. In the process, he helped change the image of Las
Vegas from Sin City to a glossy, family-friendly town. His Bellagio
is the grandest hotel on the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In an hourlong telephone interview, Wynn left little doubt that he
believes a similar formula can work in Macao.</TE>
<TE>   "Entertainment attractions of the first order, high-end shopping,
eating in fanciful restaurants--it's going to be an amazing place,"
he predicted. "Look around Asia--Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo,
Singapore--there's nothing that can come close. You don't have to do
a deal with the devil; just make a nice place and treat people well."</TE>
<TE>   He said that negotiations with the Macao government for a
20-to-25-year casino license were "99% complete" and that he expected
to sign a final agreement in the next two to three weeks. He said he
planned to spend about $500 million on a hotel-casino complex.</TE>
<TE>   Adelson is best known for his ability to draw convention business.
He struck gold in Las Vegas by launching the mammoth computer
industry Comdex convention many years ago, then selling it to
bankroll the Venetian as the Strip's first all-suites hotel catering
to businessmen, and targeting the convention trade.</TE>
<TE>   According to Macao authorities, Adelson's Galaxy Casino Co. has
pledged to invest $1 billion to build an Italian-style casino resort
complex replete with gondolas plying Venice-like canals. Adelson is
said to be nearing completion of complicated negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all this, Stanley Ho shows no signs of slowing
down--whether it's his weekly tennis games, ballroom dancing with his
40-year-old wife, Angela, or expanding his existing business empire
to meet the American challenge.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the three new licenses were granted, he announced
a $600-million plan to build a luxury hotel for mainstream customers
and an exclusive private club for high-stakes gamblers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's helped modernize Macao," said STDM senior executive Joaquim
Morais Alves. "I think he's looking forward to the competition."</TE>
<TE>   Despite investment commitments measuring well into the billions of
dollars and talk of more to come, many locals fret about whether
Macao can really make the leap from gambling den to family draw. They
look at the rough-and-tumble customers with their big chips, the loan
sharks circling the tables ready to stake losers with new cash, and
the young Chinese prostitutes waiting just outside for a share of the
action, and wonder if the distance might be too great.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even among seasoned residents, there is a guarded optimism.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly not geared up for this yet," said Father Lancelot
Rodrigues, a 78-year-old Roman Catholic priest whose preferred
daytime beverage is a tall scotch and water. "Today, they [gamblers]
come in at 4 in the afternoon, gamble until 4 in the morning and then
go down to the wharf and leave. But we've got a golf course, good
food and, if the new licensees come, then our future could be
bright."</TE>
<TE>   Added Promotion Institute director Eric Ho: "We don't have to
duplicate Las Vegas, we just have to draw the right lessons from it."</TE>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>An unmanned U.S. spy plane crashed Saturday near a remote village in
southern Pakistan, not far from a military base being used by
American forces, U.S. and Pakistani officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Predator's wreckage was found near Karim Bakhsh, about 15
miles northeast of Jacobabad, and was being examined by U.S.
soldiers, local police official Mohammed Mustafa said.</LD>
<LD>   "The plane, which was on a routine surveillance mission, lost
contact with the Jacobabad air base at 3:30 a.m.," he said.</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Humm said the
plane was returning from a mission when it crashed and that enemy
fire was not involved.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash was under investigation, he said.</TE>

<HD>Professor Sets Sights on Filling Arafat's Shoes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The first man to officially declare his desire to succeed Yasser
Arafat as president of the Palestinian Authority is a die-hard
Missouri Tigers basketball fan who does not condemn suicide bombing
attacks on Israeli civilians.</LD>
<LD>   "Palestinians have the right to do whatever possible to regain
their rights and their land," said Abdel-Sattar Qassem, a 53-year-old
political science professor with ties to Hamas and Islamic Jihad,
radical groups that have claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide
bombings against Israeli civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Qassem, who teaches at An Najah University in the West Bank city
of Nablus, said Saturday that he plans to challenge Arafat in a vote
that the Palestinian leader's aides say could be held within six
months.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Arafat agreed to implement a list of demands from
Palestinian lawmakers, including new elections for president and
parliament, and a fresh and leaner Cabinet. He appeared to back away
Friday from the promise of elections, saying Israel must first pull
back troops from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But the push for
change continued Saturday as 20 Cabinet ministers--two-thirds of the
Cabinet--offered to resign, saying it was a gesture to spur reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat won 88% of the vote in elections in 1996, and few people
expect Qassem--or any other challenger--to unseat him. But there is
growing dissatisfaction with the Palestinian leader and his Cabinet,
and Qassem is hoping to tap into those sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   Qassem said his platform would emphasize two main points: the need
to return millions of Palestinian refugees to their homeland in what
is now Israel, and to stamp out what he and many other critics say is
rampant corruption in Arafat's government.</TE>
<TE>   Qassem's stubborn opposition to both Arafat and Israel and his
blunt writings advocating the establishment of a free Palestinian
state have landed him in jail several times.</TE>
<TE>   He was imprisoned three times by Israeli when it controlled the
West Bank. In 1996, Palestinian police arrested him briefly after he
assailed the 1993 Oslo peace accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, saying they offered Palestinians little freedom and
turned Arafat into Israel's chief policeman in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Qassem spent six months in a Jericho prison
after depicting Arafat in a book as a Machiavellian ruler who
maintains control by pitting his underlings against one another.</TE>
<TE>   "Look where Arafat's rule has gotten us," Qassem said in an
interview Saturday. "The refugees are still in camps, the
Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza are still oppressed by the
Israelis, but the men closest to Arafat are well taken care of."</TE>
<TE>   Many Palestinian towns and villages are still reeling from
Israel's recent six-week offensive in the West Bank, launched in late
March after a suicide bomber killed more than two dozen Jews in a
crowded seaside hotel in the Israeli city of Netanya.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops remain in many Palestinian areas of the West Bank,
controlling roads and preventing residents from traveling freely.
Soldiers carry out almost daily raids in some towns and villages.
Dozens of Palestinians whom Israel describes as suspected militants
have been arrested in the last week.</TE>
<TE>   Casualties continued to mount Saturday. A Palestinian riding in a
car was killed in the West Bank when Israeli soldiers opened fire on
the vehicle, which the army said attempted to run a roadblock.</TE>
<TE>   Qassem studied in America's heartland, receiving a master's degree
in political science from Kansas State University and a doctorate
from the University of Missouri, where he was a regular at Tigers
basketball games. He said he keeps abreast of the team's progress
through his 20-year-old son, Mohammed, who is a computer engineering
major there.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the American people," Qassem said. "I just don't like
their government's support of Israel. The United States, which is
quick to [trumpet] human rights around the world, should be helping
to champion human rights for the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   Although Qassem said he does not belong to any political party or
religious group, he said he plans to court Islamic
fundamentalists--including Hamas and Islamic Jihad--in his campaign
for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not far away from them," he said. "We might disagree on the
issue of women: I believe that women should have full rights, and
they might have some problem with that. But we can talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst, said Qassem would
be easily beaten by Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "He will get some votes because people are disenchanted with the
[Palestinian] Authority," Khatib said. "But in the end, Qassem is too
extremist for the Palestinian people."</TE>

<HD>Polio Could Be Gone by 2004, Agencies Say</HD>
<DH>Health: Cooperation of poor countries in vaccine programs
and $275 million are all that are needed, according to U.N. experts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- Polio, which only decades ago killed thousands and
crippled millions, could finally be eradicated--everywhere,
forever--by the end of next year, say the leaders of a global
campaign against the infectious disease.</LD>
<LD>   All that is required is the continuing collaboration of some of
the world's poorest and most turbulent countries--plus $275 million
in long-requested funding that U.N. agencies need to reach the
remaining unvaccinated children.</LD>
<LD>   "Eliminating polio within the next 18 to 20 months is definitely
feasible, depending on whether we are able to get all the funds we
need and all the political and civil cooperation we need," said Bob
Keegan, deputy director of the global immunization division of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which is
providing technical assistance to the U.N.-managed campaign.</LD>
<TE>   When the U.N.-affiliated World Health Organization and the United
Nations Children's Fund launched their joint anti-polio drive in
1988, an estimated 350,000 children in 125 countries were newly
paralyzed from the disease. Then, after spending billions of dollars
vaccinating billions of children around the world, health agencies
were able to identify just 480 fresh cases in 2001, all of them in
the 10 nations where the U.N. is now concentrating its eradication
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extraordinary achievement already, when you think of
the millions of cases averted and the hundreds of lives saved,"
Keegan said.</TE>
<TE>   Civil wars, sprawling shantytowns and competing health emergencies
have kept polio alive in impoverished communities throughout South
Asia and Africa. But at 9 cents a dose, the oral polio vaccine may be
the greatest public health bargain of all time. U.N. workers say they
can get it to children in all these places, from the refugee camps of
Afghanistan to the satellite slums of Lagos, Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all tough areas, with dense populations and lots of
other problems," said Dr. Ciro de Quadros, a WHO polio specialist who
is credited with cleansing Latin America of the disease. "But by
vaccinating and re-vaccinating, we are getting rid of it. We are very
near the end, but the last leg of a race is the most difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Still, De Quadros says he is confident that the funds will be
found and the campaign will achieve its goal. "By the end of 2003,"
he said, "polio should be eliminated completely."</TE>
<TE>   Like smallpox before it, medical experts say, polio may soon
survive only as sample cultures in a few research laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are out there seeing the end of a disease, you feel that
you are participating in history," said Sebastia~o Salgado, a
prizewinning Brazilian photojournalist who spent much of last year
visiting polio clinics and vaccination brigades in Africa and South
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado's photos starkly document the work that remains to be
done.</TE>
<TE>   On a muddy bend of the Congo, bare-chested health workers with
bullhorns stop every passing boat--every ferry, every dugout
canoe--to give children their mandatory two droplets of vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   In southern India, a packed third-class passenger train is halted
between stations as doctors clamber aboard with vaccination kits,
distributing doses on the spot. In Sudan, two volunteers, resplendent
in crisp white "Just Two Drops" T-shirts, tote a cooler of vaccine to
a village a day's walk across the baking plains.</TE>
<TE>   The photographs also chronicle the human devastation of the
disease: a clutch of pleat-skirted New Delhi schoolgirls, giggling
and vibrant in every respect except the withered legs encased in
their metal braces; Mohammed, a disabled Somalian nomad left behind
by penniless parents; paralyzed Congolese teenagers with makeshift
wooden crutches and wheelchair contraptions fashioned from bicycle
parts.</TE>
<TE>   There is still no cure for polio, and paralysis can follow
infection in a few hours. Yet just four doses of vaccine during
childhood will protect against polio for life, and systematic
vaccination can rid a region of the disease permanently.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado took on the assignment at his own expense after being
approached by U.N. officials who were trying to publicize their
underfunded campaign. His first reaction to their request, he said in
an interview at a New York gallery that is showing the photographs,
"was surprise--I said, there is still polio around the world?"</TE>
<TE>   In Brazil, like almost everywhere else in the Americas, polio was
wiped out decades ago. The last documented outbreak in the Western
Hemisphere was in an isolated town in the Peruvian Andes in 1991; the
Shining Path guerrillas, who controlled the area, clandestinely aided
a door-to-door vaccination drive, De Quadros said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, where the global fight against polio began in
earnest half a century ago with the "March of Dimes" and public
inoculation drives, has been free of the disease since 1979, when
vaccinations short-circuited an outbreak in a Pennsylvania Amish
community that had previously rejected immunization.</TE>
<TE>   What most motivated Salgado, he said, was the contrast between the
polio campaign and his previous work, which focused on the
relentlessly harsh lives of indentured workers and refugees from wars
and famines. "Those are things that seem in some way to never
change," he said. "I was eager to work on a story where you see the
end of the story."</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the sales of Salgado's photos will go to the polio
fund, as will money from UNICEF's annual Halloween collections and
individual donations raised through a new campaign Web site that went
online Thursday (www.endofpolio.org).</TE>
<TE>   The United States, Japan and several European governments recently
increased donations to the U.N. Global Polio Eradication Initiative,
as have the Rotary International clubs that are by far its biggest
source of private support, giving $462 million to date. But the
vaccination campaign still needs $80 million this year alone to reach
all its targeted communities, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The next target for the WHO and UNICEF is measles, which kills a
million children each year in the world's most impoverished
countries. As with polio, massive vaccination campaigns could
virtually eliminate these fatalities. The U.N. agencies say that by
stamping out polio, they hope to be able to convince impoverished
countries and foreign donors to mobilize the resources needed to
control measles and other infectious diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first goal is the eradication of polio," De Quadros said. "If
we fail in this, we will never be able to do anything else."</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The governor of the western state of Colima ordered the evacuation of
a small town on the flanks of Mexico's most active volcano Saturday
as scientists warned that an eruption may be imminent.</LD>
<LD>   "Conditions exist for an eruption due to an increase in the
volcano's internal seismic activity," said a news release from the
office of Gov. Fernando Moreno.</LD>
<LD>   Moreno ordered the evacuation of Yerbabuena, a town of about 200
people near the peak of the 13,000-foot volcano. The governor also
issued an order prohibiting anyone from going within four miles of
the volcano, about 300 miles west of Mexico City.</LD>
<TE>   Several towns, including Yerbabuena, were evacuated in February
after hot rocks began rolling down the volcano's slope.</TE>
<TE>   Volcanologists consider the Colima volcano to be the most active
of nine volcanoes across the middle of Mexico. It has erupted
violently dozens of times in recent years.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Like Amelia Earhart, Jennifer Melvin knew at an early age that she
wanted to fly.</LD>
<LD>   A 34-year-old San Franciscan, Melvin was born 31 years after the
famed aviator disappeared on an around-the-world flight. She was
among the younger of the 120 participants in a weekend symposium of
the Amelia Earhart Society marking the 65th anniversary of the start
of Earhart's final flight.</LD>
<LD>   Various speakers discussed their theories on what happened when
Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared July 2, 1937, on
a flight from Lae, New Guinea, to Howland Island. Those theories
include that the Electra sank in the ocean or that the fliers landed
and died in the Marshall Islands.</LD>

over on Interstate 15, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The accident involving a Ford Explorer occurred about 9:30 p.m.
just north of Barstow on the major thoroughfare between Southern
California and Las Vegas, said Tracey Martinez, a spokeswoman for the
San Bernardino County Fire Department. There were no survivors, she
said.</LD>
<LD>   It was not known whether any other vehicles were involved. The
California Highway Patrol was investigating the cause of the
accident.</LD>
<TE>   Several of the victims were thrown from the SUV as it rolled, said
CHP Officer Alex Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   That stretch of Interstate 15 is one of the deadliest in the
state, with at least 127 people killed in the last three years on the
highway between Barstow and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Barstow is about 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Peter Bauer, 86; Economist Fought Foreign Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Bauer, a Hungarian-born British economist who opposed
development aid for poor countries as a waste of money, has died at
age 86.</LD>
<LD>   Bauer, who became a life baron in 1982, died May 3 at his home in
London, the House of Lords said.</LD>
<LD>   Before becoming a peer, the iconoclastic Bauer divided his
professional life between the London School of Economics, where he
was professor of economics, and his old Cambridge college, Gonville
and Caius, where he was a fellow.</LD>
<TE>   Bauer believed that governments of poor countries used Western aid
more for self-aggrandizement than for the benefit of their people.</TE>
<TE>   He maintained that the character of a country's institutions and
the aptitudes of its people, not the provision of such aid,
determined a nation's progress.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Thomas Bauer was born in 1915 in Budapest, where his father
was a bookmaker. He attended the Scholae Piae school there. When he
was 18, a friend of his father volunteered to pay for him to go to
Britain to further his education. Despite having little money and
less command of English, he was accepted by Gonville and Caius
College in 1934, where he studied economics.</TE>
<TE>   After earning a doctorate, he went back to Hungary to complete a
law degree and perform military service before returning to England.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer, who never married, taught agricultural economics at the
University of London in 1947, returning to Cambridge a year later to
lecture in economics until 1956.</TE>
<TE>   He undertook a study of Malaysia's rubber industry in 1948 for the
Colonial Office. In 1954, Bauer produced a further report for the
Colonial Office on West African Trade.</TE>
<TE>   Years of studying small-scale trade in Africa and Asia convinced
him that the poor were held back rather than helped by central
planning, large-scale government investment, trade barriers and
foreign aid--solutions almost universally urged by other development
economists.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer was Smuts Reader in Commonwealth Studies at Cambridge from
1956 until he was appointed professor of economics at the London
School of Economics in 1960. He gained emeritus status in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer explored his views on aid to poor countries in numerous
articles and books on applied economics, including "The Economics of
Underdeveloped Countries" with B.S. Yamey, published in 1957;
"Dissent on Development" in 1972; and "Equality, the Third World and
Economic Delusion" in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer's contribution to economics was recognized last month when
it was announced that he had been awarded the first Milton Friedman
Prize for Advancing Liberty, for which he was to have received
$500,000--prize money that has now gone to his estate.</TE>
<TE>   The Cato Institute cited him for his courage in espousing an
approach almost universally opposed in post-World War II
international economic circles.</TE>
<TE>   When the award was announced, Bauer told London's Daily Telegraph:
"I am truly honored. I have long admired the Cato Institute and
Milton Friedman, and recognition by both could not be more
delightful."</TE>
<TE>   Bauer's views were considered similar to the Nobelist Friedman's.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer was admired by former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who instigated the granting of his life peerage.</TE>

<HD>Mike Bearzi, 49; a Veteran Climber of the Himalayas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran Himalayan climber Mike Bearzi has died after falling during a
climb in Tibet. He was 49.</LD>
<LD>   Bearzi, who lived in Boulder, Colo., and made his living as a
master carpenter, fell May 9 while attempting to climb the northeast
face of Gyachung Kang, which at 26,085 feet is the world's
15th-highest mountain.</LD>
<LD>   Climbing partner Bruce Miller told Bearzi's family that Bearzi was
descending across a rocky snow slope late in the day when he fell
about 1,600 feet.</LD>
<TE>   Miller, who spotted the body the next day, decided it would be too
dangerous to try to retrieve it, Bearzi's brother James, of Santa Fe,
N.M., said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Bearzi's family learned of the fall about four days later when
Miller reached the Mt. Everest base camp and called on a satellite
phone.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bearzi and Miller had attempted the climb without extra
oxygen or established camps, and were accompanied only by a cook and
a porter.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike was one of the proponents of the clean alpine style, which
is quieter, lighter and doesn't use a lot of support," his brother
said. "Philosophically, he was uncomfortable with laying siege to the
mountain."</TE>
<TE>   Bearzi tried to ascend Everest three times, including two
alpine-style attempts, but was stopped each time by bad weather
during monsoon season.</TE>
<TE>   A lifelong Colorado resident, he grew up in Colorado Springs and
climbed in the mountains and canyons around Cheyenne Mountain and
Pikes Peak.</TE>
<TE>   He invented the widely used "M" system for ranking the difficulty
of mixed alpine climbs containing rock, snow and ice.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his brother James, Bearzi is survived by his wife,
Renee St. Aubin; his parents, John and Joan Bearzi of Colorado
Springs; another brother, Peter of Sisters, Ore.; and a sister, Judi
Johansen of Portland, Ore.</TE>

<HD>Airports Bracing for Really Jumbo Jet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it arrives in the U.S. later this decade, the world's largest
passenger jet will be quieter, less polluting and more comfortable
than its predecessors, its makers boast.</LD>
<LD>   The 555-seat behemoth will be able to travel 9,200 miles--or from
Los Angeles to Singapore--fully loaded, without refueling. The
super-jumbo jet might also provide greater profitability for airlines
and cheaper air fares for passengers; not to mention more legroom and
headroom, and on-board duty-free shops and cocktail lounges.</LD>
<LD>   But for all the grace it's supposed to exhibit in the air, the
Airbus A380 is already causing big headaches on the ground. The
nation's largest airports worry that they won't be ready to wedge the
239-foot-long plane into their aged and cramped facilities.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is most evident at Los Angeles International Airport,
where executives expect more A380 operations than at any other
facility in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Runways need to be separated and taxiways widened at LAX, and
passenger jet ways, connecting planes and terminals, must be
reconfigured to ensure that the two-deck planes don't hopelessly clog
the airfield. New methods will be needed to speedily service the huge
airplane with fuel and food and to unload trash and thousands of
gallons of waste.</TE>
<TE>   Time is running short to complete years of planning and
construction at airports from Anchorage to Miami in time for the
A380's expected American debut in 2006. As that date approaches, the
stakes for both Airbus and airports such as LAX are escalating.</TE>
<TE>   The European consortium has bet its future on the jumbo jet, which
is 35% larger than the Boeing 747. And officials at the Los Angeles
agency that operates LAX say their ability to accommodate the plane
is crucial to preventing San Francisco International Airport from
snatching away Los Angeles' status as the gateway to the Pacific Rim.
Bay Area leaders have been more willing to push for airport expansion
than their counterparts in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On one thing everyone agrees: This big bird will need a whole new
kind of nest. Its enormous, 261-foot wingspan is ample enough for
three blue whales to stretch out head to tail. On each flight, it can
transport the weight of 37 MTA buses, or 560 tons. It's so tall that
airport firefighters will have to double the length of their ladders
to reach doors on the second deck.</TE>
<TE>   These revolutionary dimensions prompted federal officials, who
make rules governing airport design, to review 19-year-old guidelines
for larger aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA had previously called for a 30% widening of taxiways and
runways, but now officials say the plane might need less extra space.
The agency's final ruling, expected next year, is crucial because
airports that accept federal funds must comply with the guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The delayed FAA decision makes airport officials nervous because
it typically takes 11 years, from design to construction, to create
airport facilities.</TE>
<TE>   For now, airport managers are left to speculate about how much
retrofitting their facilities will need for the A380. One estimate,
provided in a recently released report by the federal General
Accounting Office, predicts that it will cost $2.1 billion for 14
large airports to prepare for the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials provided the cost estimates to the GAO, which
tallied them and drafted the report. Researchers hoped the data would
lead to more specific parameters for accommodating the big planes.
Instead, the study raised doubts about how airports can prepare for
the A380.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some uncertainties involved in terms of what needs to
be done," said Belva Martin, an assistant director at the GAO and one
of the report's authors. "Do we have to make major changes? Can
airports get waivers? Will airlines that serve our airports actually
buy these aircraft and bring them here?"</TE>
<TE>   The logistics and cost of accommodating the A380 are of no small
consequence to Airbus, which hopes the plane can supplant Boeing's
venerable 747 as a long-haul workhorse.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus is putting $12 billion into the new plane.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge bet," said Richard L. Aboulafia, director of aviation
consulting for the Teal Group, a Fairfax, Va.-based research and
consulting firm. "They've made a whole lot of risky bets before and
haven't been wrong. But this time they're really betting the
company."</TE>
<TE>   In the future, Airbus expects more air travel between hub
airports--tilting aviation in favor of larger airplanes that can
consolidate several flights into one.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing, in contrast, predicts that air travel will continue to
fragment and that more travelers will want to bypass hubs, making
large aircraft less necessary.</TE>
<TE>   With the stakes so high, Airbus is fighting any suggestion that
its double-decker plane won't fit into America's airports.</TE>
<TE>   The company came out swinging at the GAO's findings, saying many
of the $2.1 billion in predicted upgrades are needed to accommodate
more passengers, not for A380 operations. The company puts the figure
needed to modernize the 14 airports for the A380 at $520 million.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of myth surrounds the A380 as far as what airports will
have to do to prepare for it," said Allan McArtor, chairman of Airbus
North America Holdings Inc. "It's a big airplane--there's no doubt
about it--but its turning radius is no larger than Boeing's new 747."</TE>
<TE>   The GAO debate is centered largely on LAX, which expects to be
among the first destinations for the A380. Los Angeles World
Airports, the city agency that operates the aging facility, has
estimated that it would take $1.2 billion to modernize LAX for the
plane.</TE>
<TE>   That figure is likely to drop by more than $500 million, after a
meeting last month at which Airbus and LAX officials agreed that an
extension of a runway on the airport's north side is not needed. But
with more than $700 million in other potential costs looming, LAX's
modifications still represent about one-third of all those predicted
by the GAO.</TE>
<TE>   LAX expects to log more A380 visits than any other airport because
of its status as the principal gateway to Asia, where air carriers
prefer to use aircraft that carry more passengers, said Michael
DiGirolamo, the airport's deputy director of operations.</TE>
<TE>   Already, several LAX carriers--including Singapore Airlines,
Qantas Airways, Germany's Lufthansa, Virgin Atlantic Airways, Air
France and cargo carrier FedEx--have said they will fly the
super-jumbo to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus has received 97 orders for the aircraft from nine buyers.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the plane, LAX officials estimate that it will take
$400 million to move the airport's two sets of runways farther apart,
and to build parallel taxiways between them, to provide safe
clearance between planes.</TE>
<TE>   The cost estimates were calculated as former Mayor Richard Riordan
planned a massive expansion of LAX. The numbers have not been updated
since James K. Hahn became mayor last summer, and the Hahn
administration has not said whether it is committed to making
improvements to accommodate the A380.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is of no small import to the city and the mayor. An
expansion for the big planes stands to solidify the city's
substantial share of Asian trade and tourism. But airport neighbors
are poised to criticize Hahn for any signs that he is backing down on
a campaign promise to limit expansion at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to airfield modifications, LAX officials say they must
figure out how to load and unload the 555-seat aircraft. Planners are
studying a terminal design that would allow jet ways from terminals
to connect to each of the plane's two decks.</TE>
<TE>   There are also hurdles to servicing the A380. "The limited apron
space around the plane is a major issue," said Kim Day, deputy
executive director of project and facilities development. "As it's
taking on twice the luggage, twice the meals, twice the trash is
coming off. And there is not twice the apron area. This means the
turnaround time will be increased."</TE>
<TE>   The airport will also have to revamp fuel facilities to fill the
A380's 81,890-gallon tanks. A fill-up will take two pumps 45 minutes.
In contrast, it takes about 25 minutes to fuel a 747.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus disagrees with many of the upgrades described by LAX
officials. A company letter states that LAX can successfully
accommodate the A380 for $177 million, or about one-quarter the cost
estimated by the airport.</TE>
<TE>   The company even suggests that LAX could handle the airplane today
by simply adjusting its flight operations. Airport officials
disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do nothing, the airplane will operate out of here safely,"
DiGirolamo said. "But it will create delays. Airplanes will have to
hold at the gates until the taxiways are clear. It will be a very
inconvenient problem for the traveling public."</TE>
<TE>   If the A380 landed at LAX today, air traffic controllers would be
forced to close taxiways and to taxi the jet to and from remote gates
at the far western edge of the airfield to provide safe clearances.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at San Francisco International Airport estimate that
they will require $76 million for similar fixes and modified gates
that are already being designed.</TE>
<TE>   Though Los Angeles politicians waver about how to modernize LAX,
San Francisco officials believe that their improvements for the big
planes may help them challenge LAX for more of the lucrative Asian
market.</TE>
<TE>   "It is absolutely critical to our economy and to our desired
position as the gateway to the Pacific Rim that SFO modernize," said
P.J. Johnston, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown's press secretary.
"And to do so, we have to address the runways."</TE>
<TE>   Even the nation's newest airport, Denver International, says it
will need modifications so the world's largest passenger jet can land
at the 7-year-old rural facility. Officials are spending an
additional $11 million on the airport's sixth runway, a
16,000-foot-long strip of concrete, said Steve Snyder, an airport
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Back at LAX, officials say that even if they do nothing to prepare
for the A380, the aircraft will land here in four years.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't not address these issues and say they will go away,"
said DiGirolamo, the airport agency's deputy operations director.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some time. But in long-term time sequence, we don't have
a lot of time."</TE>

<HD>Project Pitchman Builds Key Support for Developers</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Slow-growth advocates are no fans of P.R.
specialist Tom Tomlin, but for builders his services are seen as
increasingly crucial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an age when a combative public either kills or carries
developments to approval, Tom Tomlin's services as a pitchman for
California builders are in high demand.</LD>
<LD>   Threatened with ballot measures and lawsuits aimed at halting
sprawl, developers are increasingly turning to Tomlin, a onetime
campaign operative for Ronald Reagan, and others like him for help in
winning public support.</LD>
<LD>   From Ventura to Escondido, the president of Century City-based Tom
Tomlin Associates conducts polling and runs focus groups selling
business owners, stay-at-home moms and horse enthusiasts on suburban
development.</LD>
<TE>   Tomlin organizes project supporters into "grass-roots" movements.
He buys them dinner and listens to their suggestions on everything
from equestrian trails to floor plans, which are then used to make a
project more desirable. In turn, they pack city council hearings for
him. They do the selling.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen or 20 years ago, I wasn't necessary," said Tomlin, 58.
"Now, in every community I go into, there are these 'slow-growth
environmentalists.' A developer can't build a project without
consensus-building."</TE>
<TE>   The market for consultants like Tomlin emerged in the mid-1980s,
when a real estate boom collided with a rising slow-growth movement,
said Bill Fulton, a California land-use expert.</TE>
<TE>   "Consultants who help developers have always been around," Fulton
said. "The difference is, they're moving from consultants who
schmooze the politicians to consultants who schmooze the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Any large development project in a community is essentially a
political campaign now. There's always the threat of a ballot measure
or a lawsuit. So you have to sell the public from the moment you
unveil the project."</TE>
<TE>   To date, Tomlin's strategies have helped develop 8,000 homes
statewide. He is working on half a dozen projects, with his fees per
project ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 a year. Two of his thornier
developments are in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, Unocal's the Canyons would add 1,600 homes and a
business park. The Ranch at Santa Paula by Pinnacle Development Group
would double the geographic size of the city and add 2,250 homes, in
addition to apartments and a shopping complex. Both projects require
extending city boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County-based Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources,
one of the most effective slow-growth organizations in the nation, is
pushing ballot initiatives this fall that could block both
developments. The group argues that the projects will increase sprawl
without meeting affordable housing needs.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Councilwoman Barbra Williamson said Tomlin's ability
to engage the public gives elected officials "a feel for what's
acceptable. I'm a servant of the people. If they're telling me
they've listened to Mr. Tomlin, and he's good and they're happy, what
am I going to do? Tell them they're all wrong?"</TE>
<TE>   But Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks, a slow-growth
activist, disagrees. "You'll not see Tom Tomlin come to a meeting and
say, 'Hi, I'm Tom Tomlin, the P.R. guy,'" she said. "It's all
disguised through these minions, shills who appear to be genuine
supporters."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Tomlin's adversaries say they respect his skills but find
his work dishonest.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are in the hands of a master," said Richard Francis,
a Ventura attorney and driving force behind SOAR. "He goes into a
community, runs these little focus groups, tries to peel off the
edges, and tries to make people think they have a sense of
empowerment, when in fact there is none because he is completely
pulling the strings."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin feels an equal disdain for Francis and his crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a great way of framing the issues: urban sprawl,
traffic--all those buzzwords. I've always felt they're an elitist
group. The bottom line is, they've got theirs and they don't want
anyone else to have theirs."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin's efforts in both Simi Valley and Santa Paula are just
gearing up. But his background provides a road map of what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Tomlin saw his future in politics. At Pepperdine
University, he earned a bachelor's degree in political science. He
went to work for Ronald Reagan's 1966 gubernatorial campaign as an
assistant campaign manager. From 1967 to 1970, he ran Southern
California campaigns for the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   The money wasn't great. And burnout came quickly. When public
relations man Carl Terzian asked Tomlin to join his start-up firm in
Los Angeles, Tomlin signed on.</TE>
<TE>   He still craved politics. But then, he thought, wasn't selling
California homeowners on growth the ultimate political challenge?</TE>
<TE>   As president of Terzian's firm, Tomlin managed Fox Studios'
campaign to expand its Century City lot starting in 1991. A local
homeowners group opposed the project. While Los Angeles grappled with
recession, Tomlin made his case: The expansion meant more jobs.
Rejecting the expansion meant Fox might pick up and leave.</TE>
<TE>   He formed "Friends of Fox," tapping area business owners and
neighbors. Hundreds packed hearing rooms. Fox mounted a celebrity
campaign. In 1993, the City Council approved the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin left Terzian's firm to start his own in 1997. He took with
him client New Urban West Inc., which planned to build Long Canyon, a
650-home community in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Dominique Dunn, 56, a local resident who lives two blocks from the
development, remembers getting a call from Tomlin asking her to join
"Friends of Long Canyon."</TE>
<TE>   She accepted. "I figured it was a foregone conclusion that it was
going to be built, so my thought was to make sure it was done right."</TE>
<TE>   She told Tomlin she was concerned that the plans would raze too
many of the oak trees near her home. New Urban West agreed to reroute
a road, she said, creating a more rural look and saving many trees.</TE>
<TE>   The executive committee met once a month; the developer picked up
the dinner tab. They talked about everything, including home design.
"They'd show us the floor plans for the models and, literally, we'd
say, 'No, we don't like this floor plan,' and they'd change it," Dunn
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Her committee was given an annual stipend of $12,000 to distribute
to local charities, she said.</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to go before the City Council, she and hundreds
of others did. "You didn't feel like you were being used," she said.
"I like to know what goes on in my community and feel I have a say."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin hasn't won over everybody. Laura Lee Custodio of Thousand
Oaks took issue with the master-planned Dos Vientos community near
her Newbury Park home, and sued the developer over a road extension.
Tomlin has represented one of the project's developers since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Tommy Tomlin manages the public," Custodio said. "He keeps them
stupid. If a project is a good deal for the public, it sells itself.
You don't need an agent."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlin and other consultants disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all kinds of people out there who are not aware of a
project that will benefit them," said Debra Stein, president of GCA
Strategies in San Francisco. "They need to be brought into the
process and motivated to participate. Their opinion is as valid as
someone who wants to be able to keep using someone else's property to
walk their dog on for free."</TE>

<HD>Tunnel Under Border May Be 20 Years Old</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Secret passage was used to transport drugs
to U.S. and weapons to Mexico, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>At least once a week, the Tijuana attorney would pay a visit to his
white ranch house on the outskirts of Tecate, just south of the U.S.
border. Come on, he told the two caretakers living in the house. I'll
take you to town and we'll do some shopping.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican federal police believe the lawyer, who has since
disappeared, was distracting the occupants while drug traffickers
transported billions of dollars worth of illegal narcotics through a
secret tunnel that ran underneath the house to the U.S. side of the
border.</LD>
<LD>   A 21/2-month-long investigation of the underground passageway,
discovered by American drug agents in late February, has revealed a
sophisticated operation that officials believe was active for at
least a decade, far longer than they originally thought.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials say the tunnel was
one of the most profitable smuggling avenues used by the notorious
Arellano Felix drug cartel to transport drugs to the U.S. and bring
weapons and money back into Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "What's scary is that here we have so much security along the
border, yet they could have moved so much product without being
caught," said Donald Thornhill Jr., a spokesman for the DEA's San
Diego office. "It's humbling when you just consider the length of
time we think this thing was being used."</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has been charged with building the tunnel or
smuggling narcotics through it. DEA officials declined to comment on
whether they have any suspects, citing an ongoing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first drug tunnel found burrowed under the
U.S.-Mexico border, but it is one of the most elaborate. The
examination of the secret corridor, which has been cemented shut,
provided agents with clues to an extensive construction process that
may have taken as long as two years.</TE>
<TE>   Digging through the hard soil, pocked with rocks, would have been
a backbreaking endeavor that required the use of jackhammers, drills
and picks, at a pace of probably a foot a day, DEA officials said.</TE>
<TE>   When it was completed, however, the corridor provided a
near-foolproof way to transport contraband undetected. In fact, the
smugglers using the corridor were so confident in its security that
when DEA agents discovered the passageway on Feb. 27, acting on a tip
from a previous drug seizure, they found 300 pounds of marijuana
inside.</TE>
<TE>   The tunnel began under a fireplace in the ranch house outside
Tecate, where a hydraulic lift was used to move a steel grate in the
floor, revealing a passageway below.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe a small room below the fireplace was used as
a staging area to sort and package drugs. From there, the 875-foot
passageway wended its way through the earth to a barn-style house in
a rural area of eastern San Diego County known as Tierra del Sol. At
the end of the tunnel, a ladder led up to a floor safe hidden behind
a staircase in the house. The safe and the staircase could be swung
open with levers.</TE>
<TE>   The designers of the operation had to know about engineering,
welding and electrical wiring, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a real bang-up job," Thornhill said.</TE>
<TE>   The 4-by-4-foot tunnel was reinforced with planks of wood that
covered the entire length of the passageway. Railroad tracks were
laid along the floor to transport a battery-operated cart, which
pulled two flatbed cars. A ventilation pipe ran the length of the
passageway, and lightbulbs were strung from the ceiling every 50
feet.</TE>
<TE>   Using the rail carts, a shipment of drugs could reach the other
side of the border in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe the tunnel may have existed in a rough form
as long as 20 years ago, as a small "rabbit hole" used by traffickers
to get drugs north without detection.</TE>
<TE>   A more formal tunnel was probably constructed about 10 or 12 years
ago, when the homes that covered the openings on either side were
being built, Mexican and U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, neighbors on the Mexican side saw trucks carting
away large amounts of dirt from the site, but never thought much of
it, according to Miguel Angel de la Torre, general director of
tactical support for the Mexican federal preventive police.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials suspect Manuel Herrera Barraza, the Tecate head of
the Arellano Felix drug cartel, of running narcotics through the
tunnel or charging other smugglers for using it. Herrera is in
custody in Mexico City on separate narcotics charges, and Mexican
federal police said they are still investigating his connection to
the underground passageway.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the discovery of the tunnel, Mexican officials
detained the two caretakers who lived in the Tecate house, but de la
Torre said they are no longer suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The couple told Mexican investigators they were hired by a Tijuana
man several years ago to take care of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us there was something funny about it, because of how
often he took them shopping," de la Torre said. "But he bought
groceries and clothes for them and their neighbors. That hooked them
into going with him and not asking questions."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican investigators, who believe the man was using a pseudonym,
have not been able to locate him.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a long way to go" to apprehend those involved, de
la Torre added.</TE>
<TE>   During the time the tunnel was active, the 50-acre property on the
U.S. side was a pig ranch owned by a man named Elbert Johnson, who
was arrested in Hope, Ark., in November 2001 for transporting 2,500
pounds of cocaine, according to federal law enforcement authorities.
He was convicted and is serving a 30-year sentence in federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   The land was then purchased by a couple, Belinda and Raul
Alvarado, according to property records, who rented out the buildings
on the property. When drug agents discovered the passageway, the home
concealing the tunnel had been unoccupied for six months.</TE>
<TE>   The Alvarados told investigators they were not aware of the
tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   When contacted by a reporter, Belinda Alvarado said she could not
comment on the matter, upon advice of her attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Since the recent death of one of the Arellano Felix brothers and
the apprehension of another, U.S. officials said they have been
receiving tips about more tunnels under the border.</TE>
<TE>   But finding the passageways is not easy, Thornhill said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just go onto private property and look for tunnels," he
said. "We have to have a reason."</TE>

<HD>GOP Senator Criticizes FBI for Response After Warning</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Shelby says the bureau should have
aggressively investigated flight schools. Sparring persists over
briefing given to the president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A key Republican senator said Saturday that the FBI was "either
asleep or inept or both" when it failed to act more aggressively on a
warning last July about an unusual number of Middle Eastern students
enrolled in U.S. flight schools.</LD>
<LD>   The accusation by Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the top
Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, stoked a growing
political furor over whether the government should have done more to
anticipate the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   While assailing the FBI's actions in response to the flight school
information, Shelby defended President Bush's handling of a warning
he received in August about possible hijacking of U.S. aircraft.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe President Bush, if he had had information to act on, he
would have acted on it," Shelby said in an interview broadcast by
CNN. Administration officials have said the information was not
specific and provided no warning that hijackers would crash planes
into buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby was highly critical of the FBI, however, for its response
to a July memo from an agent in Phoenix urging a full-scale
investigation of whether followers of Osama bin Laden were taking
flight training. He said the information was never passed on to the
CIA or the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI was either asleep or inept or both," Shelby said.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller: Response Could Have Been Stronger</TE>
<TE>   In an appearance before a congressional committee this month, FBI
Director Robert Mueller acknowledged that the bureau could have
responded more aggressively to the memo. But he also noted that,
"even if we had followed those suggestions at that time, it would
not, given what we know since Sept. 11, have enabled us to prevent
the attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to Shelby's comments, FBI Assistant Director John E.
Collingwood said the agency was "working diligently with the joint
congressional committees to ensure a full understanding by the
American public of what the FBI did and did not know prior to Sept.
11."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), another member of the Intelligence
Committee, brushed aside Republican criticism that Democrats were
playing politics by seeking to investigate what the administration
knew before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It is wrong, Wyden said on CNN's "Saturday Edition" program, "to
call anybody irresponsible who asks tough questions about what sure
looks like an intelligence failure."</TE>
<TE>   Wyden said he plans to grill officials at a Senate aviation
security hearing Tuesday on what warnings were given to airlines and
when. Associated Press reported Saturday that the Federal Aviation
Administration on April 18, 2001, warned airlines that Middle Eastern
terrorists might try to hijack or blow up a U.S. plane and that
carriers should "demonstrate a high degree of alertness."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, meanwhile, were stepping up their counteroffensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans know that President Bush, when faced with credible
information about a threat, would act swiftly and strongly," the
Republican National Committee said in a message posted on its Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Suggestions to the contrary, the statement said, are
"irresponsible and politically motivated."</TE>
<TE>   Bush was told during an Aug. 6 briefing about possible hijackings,
but the discussion did not address the possibility that aircraft
could be used as missiles to destroy buildings, the committee said.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby said the Aug. 6 briefing dealt with general information,
nothing specific. "There was not anything in there that most of us on
the committee didn't already know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Newsweek poll conducted Thursday and Friday found that opinion
is split on whether the president did all he should have with the
information he received prior to Sept. 11, with 48% saying he did and
39% saying he didn't. But Bush's approval rating remains a strong
73%, according to the telephone poll by Princeton Survey Research
Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Majorities of poll respondents said they thought top FBI and CIA
officials did not do all they should have with the information they
received. Still, most participants retained a favorable, though
"significantly reduced," opinion of the agencies, according to the
survey.</TE>

<HD>She's Getting the Skinny on Food Labeling</HD>
<DH>Diet: Meredith Berkman went after the makers of Pirate's
Booty, whose claims seemed too good to be true. The issue, she says,
is public health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When Meredith Berkman's 2-year-old daughter chanted, "Booty! Booty!"
for breakfast, the New York mom often gave in.</LD>
<LD>   After all, the package of the toddler's favorite snack, Pirate's
Booty, declared it was "Good for you!" The nutritional panel claimed
the rice puffs contained very little fat--and even a few vitamins.</LD>
<LD>   But it was wrong.</LD>
<TE>   Last December, an astute Good Housekeeping Institute staffer who
thought it was all too good to be true tested the booty and blew the
whistle. It seems the rice puffs were not manna for moms but ordinary
junk food in disguise, containing as much fat as a bag of corn
chips--and more than three times the amount advertised.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Berkman launched a $50-million, class-action lawsuit
claiming "emotional distress" and nutritional damage. Jay Leno mocked
the suit on his show, saying: "Here's a tip: If the snack you're
eating contains the word 'booty,' you're probably not going to be
losing much weight."</TE>
<TE>   Berkman, a fit and fashionable 37-year-old writer and mother of
two, didn't mean to become the Erin Brockovich of low-fat food. But
she found herself butting into strangers' conversations about the
lawsuit to explain that, really, it was the principle of the thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The specifics of this case are about the fat, but the larger
context is truth in labeling," she said. "I don't want their
money--any rewards will go to charity. I just want them to be
accountable."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer, Berkman's brother-in-law, assumed a New York-ironic
tone when he wrote the complaint, noting that Berkman represents all
consumers who ruined their diets, had to spend more time at the gym
and fattened up their kids while thinking they were actually cutting
calories. She realizes the whole thing can sound absurd. "I feel like
I'm in the 'Seinfeld' episode about the yogurt shop that made
everybody fat because it was really selling high-calorie ice cream,"
she said. "My husband paces the apartment, muttering that he's so
glad I kept my own last name."</TE>
<TE>   But the issue, she emphasized, is quite serious: a misleading
label can be a matter of life and death for people with food
allergies.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration agrees. While it doesn't verify
every company's nutritional panel information, it does issue
mandatory guidelines to safeguard consumers' health. And it wasn't
the first time the maker of Pirate's Booty, Robert's American Gourmet
Foods Inc., was caught mislabeling products.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, the FDA warned the company for asserting that its
Fruity Booty was mostly fruit, when in fact the rice and corn puffs
contained very little. It also was reprimanded for making health
claims for echinacea, gingko biloba, St. John's Wort and spirulina in
other snacks. Robert's withdrew or amended the products, although a
spokesman said the changes weren't prompted by the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   Robert's snack line, however, continued to grow in popularity
because of its purported low-fat content. Weight Watchers' members
traded notes on Internet chat rooms, health clubs sold the rice puffs
as diet food and in New York nearly every stroller seemed to have a
package of "booty" in the basket. Pirate's Booty even made Vanity
Fair's "in" list.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Delia Hammock, Good Housekeeping's director of
nutrition, decided to have the snack her colleagues kept raving about
tested. "It didn't taste low-fat to me," she said, "and when it
tastes too good to be true, it usually is."</TE>
<TE>   At an independent laboratory, chemists ground up samples, bathed
them in acid until only the soluble fat was left, then dried and
weighed the fat. They found 8 grams of fat and 147 calories--a far
cry from the 2.5 grams of fat and 128 calories the package claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Another lab found that Veggie Booty, a high-in-vitamin spinach and
kale coated rice puff that was a favorite among moms whose kids
wouldn't eat their greens, had 10 grams of fat--the same as a candy
bar.</TE>
<TE>   After Hammock confronted Robert's, the company issued a recall in
January and explained on its Web site that new machinery had
necessitated a change in the recipe. A company spokesman, Griffin
Douglas, refused to comment on the label's discrepancy, saying only,
"There's no explanation."</TE>
<TE>   The nutrition panel now shows Pirate's Booty has 5 grams of fat. A
follow-up test showed it was closer to 6 grams, said Ron Schnitzer at
Sani-Pure Labs in New Jersey. "It's a little closer, but they still
don't have it right." The FDA allows a 20% variation.</TE>
<TE>   The new label surprises some folks who thought they had finally
found a guilt-free snack food. "I would give Veggie Booty to my
daughter when she didn't eat her vegetables. The label said it had
all those vitamins," Susanna Jacobs said while watching her
3-year-old at a Central Park playground. "I might as well have been
giving her Haagen-Dazs for dinner. I feel deceived."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Berkman tolerates the jokes about her "booty"
fetish, saying it's worth it if it brings consumers closer to knowing
that what they see on labels is not always really what they get.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans assume that someone is watching, that the companies'
claims are policed carefully," said Berkman. "Well, the FDA is
overburdened. This lawsuit is our message to the company."</TE>

<HD>Lynne Cheney Champions the Need to Learn History</HD>
<DH>Education: The vice president's wife says it's vital for
America's youth to understand the past. She has written a book to
help them do that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For much of her public life, Lynne Cheney has been an apostle of the
American faith, a vocal advocate of teaching children history as a
heroic narrative linking turning-point events.</LD>
<LD>   But since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the wife of Vice
President Dick Cheney has become even more passionate about
instilling in American youth an appreciation of the values that
underpin democracy.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the things you learn from studying history is about
contingency," she said in an interview. "You learn that our situation
right here, right now, is so fragile and ... that liberty is a very
precious thing and it's worth our thoughtful attention and our ardent
defense."</LD>
<TE>   That was one of the key themes of a speech Cheney gave Saturday in
Beverly Hills to a luncheon benefit for Childhelp USA, a nonprofit
group dedicated to fighting child abuse. The group honored Cheney as
its "woman of the world" for her contributions to the lives of
children.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at war, our nation has been attacked, and we will continue
to be threatened," Cheney, wearing a red suit with an American flag
pin, said in the interview Friday. "When you have to defend your
country, I think it's very wise to teach the next generation what it
is that we're defending--and why it's worth defending."</TE>
<TE>   History a Favorite Topic</TE>
<TE>   That is not a new theme for the 60-year-old Cheney, who said she
has been fascinated by history for as long as she can remember. It
was a topic she addressed frequently as head of the National
Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to 1993. And it's one she's
continued to expound upon as a senior fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall she took a stand against educators who had asserted that
the United States might have made the attacks more likely by failing
to instill an understanding of other cultures. A higher-education
group she founded issued a report that said universities were doing
an inadequate job of teaching Western culture and American history.
That led to charges that Cheney was trying to stifle criticism of the
Bush administration's conduct on the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In February, in an address to a group of politically conservative
activists in Virginia, she urged the staging of "teach-ins" to
promote understanding of U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   The recent release of scores on a history test given in 2001 by
the National Assessment of Educational Progress seems to support
Cheney's concerns. The results showed that only 11% of American high
school seniors had adequate knowledge of U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Such results, Cheney said, demonstrate that American teachers are
poorly prepared to teach history. And for that she blames the
nation's colleges of education. Cheney said few colleges require
undergraduates to study history. But even more damaging, she said, is
that prospective elementary school teachers aren't studying it
either.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a country that has made progress in terms of living up to
our founding ideals, the chief of those, of course, being the ideal
of equality. We have not achieved a state of perfection, but we've
gotten closer to it," Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   But schools are not solely responsible for conveying that message,
she said. "We're all teachers," she said, calling on Americans to
look to history for stories to inspire children.</TE>
<TE>   She told two such stories during her speech Saturday--those of
Frederick Douglass, the former slave who became an influential
abolitionist, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the suffragist leader and
early women's rights leader.</TE>
<TE>   Book for Youngsters</TE>
<TE>   Cheney also is doing her part to convey lessons of the past in a
book she's written for youngsters called "America," with the subtitle
"A Patriotic Primer."</TE>
<TE>   "A," not surprisingly, "is for America, the land that we love."
"D" is for the "Declaration that proclaimed we were free." That page
bears these words of Thomas Paine: "We have it in our power to begin
the world over again."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney said she recently was sitting with her 7-year-old
granddaughter as the child read those words. "For her, it was an
introduction to the American story, this amazing, amazing tale,"
Cheney said. "One we need to protect."</TE>

<DL>LITTLETON, Colo.</DL>
<LD>LITTLETON, Colo. -- Sean Graves spent three years having to use a
wheelchair after being wounded in the Columbine High massacre. But
Saturday, aided by a crutch, he walked across the stage to a standing
ovation to receive his diploma as the last class to witness the
shooting rampage graduated.</LD>
<LD>   Graves was shot four times April 20, 1999, leaving him nearly
paralyzed from the waist down. He began walking short distances this
year with the help of a crutch. Graves was wounded as he stood
outside the school with a friend, Daniel Rohrbough, who was killed by
the two gunmen.</LD>
<LD>   The 450 close-knit graduates of the Littleton school received
their diplomas at an amphitheater south of Denver. But first they
paused to remember two classmates who didn't survive the attack,
Steven Curnow and Rohrbough, as well as two students who were killed
during an unsolved shooting at a sandwich shop in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Inside their diplomas, graduates received a second tassel in
memory of their fallen classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Frank DeAngelis, the only remaining administrator from
the time of the shootings, thanked the class for supporting him the
last three years. He apologized because they did not have a "normal
high school life."</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe that you have gained strength because of the
obstacles that you have had to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   There also were signs of a typical graduation. Air horns sounded
during the ceremony and one graduate mooned the crowd with a "Hi Mom"
message.</TE>
<TE>   The graduates lined up along the back of the amphitheater, facing
the crowd, as their class song, "Bittersweet Symphony," played over
the loudspeaker. Just after they threw their caps in the air, four
military jets flew across the sky in formation.</TE>
<TE>   Just more than three years ago, students Eric David Harris and
Dylan Bennet Klebold opened fire at the school, killing 12 students
and a teacher before killing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Marie Hochholter, who was paralyzed in the shooting and
graduated two years ago, came to Saturday's ceremony to watch her
brother Nathan graduate.</TE>
<TE>   "They're strong kids," she said. "They stuck with it for three
more years."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Hooker, whose two sons escaped unharmed, expressed amazement
at the graduates' strength as he watched his youngest son receive his
diploma.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who said, 'We are Columbine.' It was their
example that inspired the staff and the community."</TE>

<HD>With a 'Goodbye, Denver,' City Loses Longtime Voice</HD>
<DH>Journalism: Columnist Gene Amole, faced with dying, decided
to chronicle his last days for his readers. The series ended Monday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>In a city focused on the future, Gene Amole was the elegant spokesman
for the past.</LD>
<LD>   Change made him cranky. Sprawl made him cross. As a columnist for
24 years at the Rocky Mountain News, he played the role of nostalgic
old-timer in a town swarming with newcomers.</LD>
<LD>   He could be stubborn, contrary, out of step with the times. But
his abiding decency and generous spirit made him the dean of Denver
journalists, the city's answer to Herb Caen or Mike Royko.</LD>
<TE>   The typical Amole column was a diatribe against the
taxpayer-funded airport, or a screed against taxpayer-funded
stadiums, or a wistful paean to the old days, when Denver's air and
water were clean, its politics dirty. (Colorado's governor in the
1950s pulled a gun on Amole, a memory he treasured.)</TE>
<TE>   Change was Amole's subject, his constant foe, until October, when
he encountered one change he couldn't fight: His own mortality. In a
memorable column that caught even his colleagues by surprise, the
78-year-old columnist announced that he was dying and that he would
cover his last days as a story.</TE>
<TE>   For months Amole wrote about the pain of death, the humor of it,
the inconvenience. He rambled and rhapsodized and wept on the page,
and described the dying of the light. During one 17-week span he
wrote a column every day the newspaper published, outworking
colleagues a third his age.</TE>
<TE>   His chronicle of a death foretold drew thousands of e-mails and
letters and phone calls, and his long-standing connection with the
city grew even deeper.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the chronicle ended. One day after Amole died of
"multi-system failure," the News published his farewell, one last
column Amole had left in reserve.</TE>
<TE>   "Goodbye, Denver," read the front-page headline, above the
familiar photo of Amole, hand to his temple, smiling wistfully. It
was a sterling piece of journalism, more for what it was than for
what it said. Even in death the consummate newspaperman had managed
to make one last deadline.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, capping a week of remembrance, Denver honored Amole by
doing what it seldom does, what Amole was forever telling it to do:
It paused. Hundreds gathered in Civic Center Park for a reading of
Amole's finest columns, an unusual tribute for a man who didn't
consider himself a great writer.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gavin, a friend and former managing editor of the News, told
the crowd that Amole would be sorely annoyed to see them all there.
"If ever there was a man noisily intent on slipping quietly away,"
Gavin said. "Yet here we all are, trampling his careful plans."</TE>
<TE>   He closed with a fitting send-off for a curmudgeon: "May flights
of angels sing him to his rest," Gavin grumbled. "Whether he likes it
or not."</TE>
<TE>   Amole was born in Denver, and seemingly born to newspapers. He
learned to read by studying the News through his grandfather's
magnifying glass.</TE>
<TE>   In his inaugural column, and often thereafter, he spoke of the
newsroom as his paradise, his home, his destiny. "Everyone has to be
somewhere," he wrote in 1993. "My somewhere is the newsroom."</TE>
<TE>   That may be why he treated the News as he treated people, with a
cherishing tenderness, an old-fashioned courtliness. Sometimes,
referring to the News, he would adopt a reverent tone normally
reserved for his wife, Trish, his four children and his grandson.</TE>
<TE>   Long before he walked into the newsroom, however, Amole was
already a household name in Denver. Popular disc jockey, pioneering
TV personality, wealthy businessman--and, above all, war hero.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the 6th Armored Division when he was barely out of his
teens, he fought in many of the epic battles of World War II,
including the Battle of the Bulge. War formed him. War hardened his
head and softened his heart. War made him permanently wistful, and
writing a column helped him work out why. Readers often held their
breath as he struggled with the poignancy of his war memories and
tried to translate their emotional aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, nearly 44 years after the day he came home, he wrote
about the scene:</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, Pop and Grandpa were waiting for me at the top of the
passenger ramp at Denver Union Station. I tried to hug them all at
the same time and still keep my duffle bag on my shoulder. My mother
was crying as she counted the battle stars on my ETO ribbon. I was
alive and home. The war was over and I wanted nothing more than to
put it behind me forever.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't long, though, before I began to realize that it would
never be over for me."</TE>
<TE>   The young veteran suffered flashbacks and nightmares and insomnia,
which lasted for decades. He also endured bouts of survivor's guilt,
as one of only three young men from his neighborhood who returned
from the battlefields. He never forgot the five who didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the war columns were rare. He much preferred writing about
autumn, Dvorak or dinner. He could make a column from a beautiful
sunrise and the smell of fresh-brewed coffee. He was a renaissance
man, equally able to discuss French impressionists, Colorado poet
laureate Thomas Hornsby Ferril or the proper way to cook a meatball.
In one of his best-known columns he divulged his secret recipe for
Thanksgiving stuffing, mixing the ingredients with references to
Lao-tse and Gertrude Stein.</TE>
<TE>   "The authenticity of Gene Amole really spoke to people," said
Patricia Raybon, associate professor of journalism at the University
of Colorado-Boulder. "When we talk about writing a personal essay,
the name Montaigne always comes up, and one of the things about the
Montaigne model that Gene practiced is an element of self-abrasion, a
kind of dismissive quality about yourself and your own importance."</TE>
<TE>   Read one after another, Amole's columns could also be viewed as a
series of 600-word love letters to a vanished Denver. For a 1991
column, he simply walked downtown, sat on a bench and closed his
eyes, recalling how everything looked and smelled half a century
before. He could remember every bar, every brothel, every barbershop,
and he evoked them all with a mapmaker's precision.</TE>
<TE>   "I can still hear streetcars clanging their way from one
intersection to the next," he wrote. "Joe 'Awful' Coffee, owner of
the Ringside Lounge on lower 17th Street, would shadowbox with you as
he escorted you to a booth for dinner.... Clark's Drug Store in the
Albany poured the richest, thickest chocolate shakes in Denver. The
'Mayor of 17th Street' was Danny Abeyta, whose shine parlor was right
next door. Every morning, bookies, horse players, stock brokers and
other gamblers lined up for a Kiwi luster on their Florsheims while
Danny's wife blocked Stetsons at the rear of the store."</TE>
<TE>   Some read Amole's columns as the diary of an honest man's life. So
it made perfect sense that he would attempt an honest diary of
dying--though a few colleagues cringed, fearing readers would recoil.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the response was "almost overwhelming," said News editor
and publisher John Temple. "Wherever I went in this city, I heard,
'Thank you for letting Gene Amole write this column.'"</TE>
<TE>   Most of the final columns were written from home, in the study
where he would die. No longer strong enough to visit his beloved
newsroom every day, he made one last trip to the newspaper, in
December, for a ceremony in which Mayor Wellington E. Webb officially
renamed the street outside the News: Gene Amole Way.</TE>
<TE>   Dapper in a tan hat and trench coat, Amole choked up as he told
the crowd, "I'll always be here," then walked off on the arm of his
daughter, a former reporter at the News.</TE>
<TE>   Many who gathered Friday at Civic Center Park agreed that Amole
would always be in the News. Some said he would also always be in
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of kept my dad alive for me to read his column," said
Evelyn Drake, a retired teacher, wiping tears from her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   But the columns became something more, she added, when she
realized each one might be the last.</TE>
<TE>   "He made us realize that dying is a part of living," she said.
"There's nothing to be afraid of, but you have to face these things.
There's nothing to fear, but you just have to help those you love get
through it."</TE>

<HD>The CIA Rebuilds on War Footing</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Under scrutiny for intelligence failures, the
agency is adding staff and resources at a pace not seen since
Vietnam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The CIA, battered by harsh new questions of what it knew before the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, has struggled for the last eight months
to recover from the staggering intelligence failure.</LD>
<LD>   America's long-troubled spy service is ramping up at its fastest
rate since the Vietnam War era. Money is pouring in--$1 billion so
far, with more expected. So are bugged conversations, satellite
photos and other raw intelligence about Al Qaeda cells and operations
around the world.</LD>
<LD>   "Today, the year 2002, I have more spies stealing more secrets
than at any time in the history of the CIA," Jim Pavitt, head of the
agency's clandestine service, told a Duke University Law School
conference last month.</LD>
<TE>   Among the CIA spies: an Afghan aide to Osama bin Laden who says he
was paid nearly $50,000 to report on the Saudi dissident's terrorism
organization, Al Qaeda, and recently was asked to pose as a prisoner
and go as an informant to the U.S. detention center for suspected
terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA's Counter-Terrorist Center, a hub in the war on terrorism,
has nearly tripled in staff, to about 1,200. Mock street
signs--including Bin Laden Way--hang from the ceiling to help
newcomers negotiate the ever-expanding maze of map-lined cubicles and
conference rooms filled with computers.</TE>
<TE>   How well the CIA's secret war is going is far less clear, however.</TE>
<TE>   Intercepted conversations and other intelligence reports suggest
another major terrorist attack may be in the works. A senior
intelligence official said Saturday that ''threats, things of
concern'' have increased again in the last month.</TE>
<TE>   ''These things, the noise, the chatter, go in cycles,'' he said.
''We've seen this several times since Sept. 11. We are in an up cycle
at the moment.''</TE>
<TE>   But the official said the threats were not specific as to when,
where or how an attack might take place. ''There's stuff
everywhere,'' he said. ''It may indicate something is up, but we
don't know what.''</TE>
<TE>   Another senior intelligence official warns that the CIA is at a
crossroads. ''If there's another terrorist act, and we're caught
flat-footed again, we run the risk of being dismantled,'' he said.
''We're on a high, but it's fragile.''</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, last week's disclosure that the CIA on Aug. 6 told
President Bush about the possibility of an Al Qaeda hijacking attempt
has fueled a furious debate about whether the U.S. intelligence
apparatus failed to detect or avert the Sept. 11 attacks on the
Pentagon and the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the intelligence community's latest classified scorecard
of Al Qaeda's top 27 leaders shows more than half--including Bin
Laden--are believed to still be alive. The agency recently got a DNA
sample from a Bin Laden family member in the event a body is found.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the list indicates, nine Al Qaeda leaders have been killed
and four are in custody, including operations chief Abu Zubeida and
Ibn Al-Shaykh al-Libi, the alleged head of a terrorist training camp.</TE>
<TE>   The four-page classified accounting also names about 65 lesser Al
Qaeda and Taliban members believed to have survived the U.S.-led
assault so far. Not all the names are known to be accurate, however,
and photographs are missing for many.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Select
Committee on Intelligence, says the CIA deserves an "A-plus for
effort, but six or seven out of 10 for results" so far. "I'm
frustrated we can't do better," Goss said.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA still has too few skilled analysts and too few overseas
operatives able to penetrate and eliminate terror cells and networks,
he said. "We are undermanned and overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   Spy planes, surveillance sensors and other high-tech hardware have
provided "extraordinary" intelligence, Goss said, but most spy
satellites were built to watch ships and tanks during the Cold War.
"We have a lot of capability that's not designed to peek in a cave."</TE>
<TE>   Others are more critical. A congressional aide griped that the CIA
still doesn't coordinate enough with other government agencies:
"Things don't get shared like they're supposed to get shared."</TE>
<TE>   And a former senior CIA official who retains close ties to the
intelligence community says the CIA remains in the dark about key
issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have answers yet to the fundamental questions" about Al
Qaeda, said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"Who's in charge? How do they communicate? How are they wired
together? What are their capabilities? Is the U.S. their principal
target? Are they still trying to get sleepers in? What are their
operational plans?"</TE>
<TE>   In response, a senior CIA official said Bin Laden holds
operational plans so closely that even some of his top aides might
not know the answers. "They continue to operate with extraordinary
compartmentalization," he said. "There's hardly anyone in Al Qaeda
who can answer those questions."</TE>
<TE>   The CIA clearly had tried. "On Sept. 10, we were devoting more
resources against the terrorist target than at any other intelligence
challenge we faced," said Pavitt, the CIA spy chief.</TE>
<TE>   The agency began targeting Bin Laden when he moved his base of
operations to Afghanistan in 1996. The counter-terrorist center set
up a Bin Laden "station," assigned to track the terrorism chief.</TE>
<TE>   Covert teams went into Afghanistan at least once in the late 1990s
to plant surveillance devices, while other operatives mapped and
prepared a desert airstrip south of the Afghan capital of Kabul in
case they found a chance to grab Bin Laden, according to a former
Clinton administration official.</TE>
<TE>   Other CIA operatives met with anti-Taliban guerrillas in
Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. Pilotless Predator aircraft, then
armed only with cameras, were sent aloft to aid the search. Back at
headquarters, senior CIA officials met each morning "to specifically
discuss, 'What's Bin Laden up to and how can we get him?'" another
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the possibility of various snatch operations," the
official added. "We looked at getting locals to go after Bin Laden,
but it was very hard. He and his crew were very security conscious."</TE>
<TE>   The CIA relied, in part, on an Afghan spy inside Bin Laden's
entourage.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with The Times, the Afghan said he had volunteered
his services at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
on Oct. 16, 2000, just days after Al Qaeda operatives bombed the U.S.
destroyer Cole while it was docked in the port city of Aden, Yemen.
"I have been working with Osama if you want my cooperation," he
recalled saying.</TE>
<TE>   During interrogations, ultimately backed by polygraph tests, the
Afghan told the CIA he had been a low-level aide in Bin Laden's camp
for several years and had joined the renegade Saudi for meals and
prayers. "In all, I saw Osama more than 100 times."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two years, the CIA paid the Afghan $500 to $1,000 a
month for details about Al Qaeda operations, staff and infrastructure
in Afghanistan. "They wanted to know: how many people? How many
camps? How many houses? They had many maps. We were always working on
that."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, he was issued two satellite phones to call in
coordinates for U.S. airstrikes on Taliban and Al Qaeda military
positions in eastern Afghanistan, including four that ultimately were
bombed.</TE>
<TE>   And in March this year, the Afghan said, his U.S. handlers asked
him to pose as a prisoner and go in as an informant to the Al Qaeda
detention center at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay. He didn't
go, but agreed to help identify mug shots of those in custody.</TE>
<TE>   The Times was able to verify key parts of the man's story and is
withholding his identity for his safety. A CIA spokesman declined to
comment, other than to say that the agency had informants inside Bin
Laden's camp.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, they weren't enough. The CIA had been battered by
budget and staff cuts, revolving-door leaders and plummeting morale
in the 1990s. The crisis eased after the current director, George J.
Tenet, was confirmed in 1997. But repeated screw-ups, including the
failure to foresee India's nuclear test in 1998 and the U.S.'
mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in
1999, suggested an agency adrift.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11. CIA headquarters at Langley, Va., was
evacuated for fear it might be a target. By the time the shaken staff
went back inside, the world was a different place.</TE>
<TE>   "By midafternoon on Sept. 11, the mission of the CIA was
permanently and radically changed," a senior intelligence official
said. "We're a lead agency now. People know it. There's high energy;
no time for conferences and reviews and panels. There's focus. We're
hiring. We're talking to foreign governments, foreign [spy] services.
We're the go-to guys.</TE>
<TE>   "It impacts on every nook and cranny in the building," he added.
"There's a new machismo. People say: 'We're gonna get the bastards.
We're gonna kick ass.' A few years ago, if you talked like that,
you'd be marginalized."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Intelligence Committee, agrees. The terrorist attacks
"unleashed" an agency he had long called hidebound and timid. He sees
a "different attitude at the CIA" since last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Money has helped. Congress authorized $1 billion in emergency
funding for the CIA last fall, on top of its estimated $3-billion
annual budget. The agency will get more under proposed bills in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   And after the attacks last fall, Bush quickly authorized the use
of targeted killings and other no-holds-barred tactics that had long
been restricted.</TE>
<TE>   A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard, the CIA's executive director, told a group
of Washington investment advisors in October that the Bush
administration had "showered" the CIA with cash and power. "Today,
there is only one rule, and that is, there are no rules," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the frantic all-nighters have largely faded at headquarters.
But behind the barbed wire and black-uniformed guards with M-4
rifles, cars still jam the parking lots and pack the roadsides.</TE>
<TE>   The counter-terrorism center, which includes experts from the FBI,
Secret Service, Pentagon and other agencies, has spilled out of its
ground floor facility. A veteran undercover officer will take over
this summer from the longtime director, Cofer Black, who is taking a
new job.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all those at the center were pulled in from other CIA
units, so the agency has rehired several hundred retirees and other
former employees to fill the gaps. Those fluent in Dasi, Pasto, Farsi
and Arabic got special attention.</TE>
<TE>   And more expansion is planned.</TE>
<TE>   Next month's graduating class of more than 100 CIA officers from
"The Farm," the agency's boot camp near Williamsburg, Va., will be
the largest since the Vietnam War, officials said. Far more want to
join: The agency has logged a staggering 80,000 job applications
since last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Some seek to join the CIA's Special Activities Division, the part
of Pavitt's clandestine service. It has deployed about 150 former
Navy SEALs and other Special Forces soldiers to Afghanistan since the
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the first American into Afghanistan in September was a
30-year CIA veteran operative, fluent in Arabic and Farsi, who was at
a desk job at headquarters awaiting retirement. .</TE>
<TE>   The first American killed in Afghanistan in the campaign, Johnny
"Mike" Spann, also was a CIA covert commando. To mark his sacrifice,
the agency will chisel a 79th black star into the headquarters lobby
wall this month. The white marble "wall of honor" commemorates
members who died in the line of duty.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA teams did little fighting themselves; they helped hire,
arm and pay Afghan proxy forces. The operatives also searched and
mapped at least two empty foreign embassies in Kabul in November
after the Taliban abandoned the city. CIA officials decline to
comment, but the agency elsewhere has reaped valuable intelligence by
bugging foreign missions.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA also remote-controls the small fleet of pilotless Predator
aircraft. In late 2000, a CIA drone filmed a tall, bearded man in
flowing robes, flanked by deferential guards. Bin Laden, it appeared,
was crossing the street.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't look at that and not say, 'Damn, I wish I had a missile
on this thing,'" said an official who had viewed the tape. The
Clinton White House agreed, and authorized arming Predators with
Hellfire antitank missiles. The first were deployed just as the war
began.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their fame, the Predator missiles have missed several
high-profile targets in Afghanistan. They scored their most notable
success when a drone helped laser-target an Al Qaeda compound for Air
Force bombers. CIA operators, alarmed that video monitors showed
several men running away, launched the Hellfire. Among those who were
killed was Mohammed Atef, Bin Laden's military commander.</TE>

<HD>FBI Report on Bomber Denied</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ex-informant denies a statement that she saw
Cherry plant device at church in 1963.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>A former FBI informant testified Saturday that she never told the
agency she saw Bobby Frank Cherry plant the bomb that blew up a
church at the height of the civil rights era and killed four black
girls, contradicting a 1964 agency report.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI report quoted Mary Frances Cunningham, who worked for the
bureau after the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963, as
saying she saw Cherry place the bomb at the church. The report also
said she witnessed Cherry and three other Ku Klux Klan suspects
sitting in a car near the church the morning of the bombing.</LD>
<LD>   As the defense began calling witnesses Saturday, Cunningham said
she never gave the FBI that information.</LD>
<TE>   "I did not make that claim. I did not make that statement to
anyone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham is the sister-in-law of Robert Chambliss, a Klan member
charged in the bombing and convicted in 1977. He died in prison.
While an informant, Cunningham said she told the FBI information she
learned from Chambliss' wife.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry, 71, a retired trucker from Mabank, Texas, is charged with
murder in the deaths of four girls on a Sunday morning before church.
He faces life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Mickey Johnson is expected to rest his case
Monday, and jurors could get the case by Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   An investigator for the Alabama attorney general's office in the
1970s testified Saturday that Cunningham told him another story. In
an interview with Cunningham, investigator Bob Eddy said she told him
she made up the information she gave the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "She stated she just overheard things from the FBI and made up the
story," Eddy said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors finished calling witnesses against Cherry on Friday.
Their case included haunting testimony from the lone survivor of five
girls who went into a church lounge on a Sunday morning to get ready
for services.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Collins Rudolph, now 51, was temporarily blinded in the
blast that brought debris and glass crashing down on the girls in the
basement lounge of the church. The Sept. 15, 1963, explosion killed
Rudolph's sister, Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia
Wesley, all 14, and Denise McNair, 11.</TE>
<TE>   Rudolph said she was standing at a sink washing her hands and
watching her sister tie the sash on Denise's dress when she heard a
loud noise and was blinded by glass flying into her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I began to call Addie. I said, 'Addie, Addie, Addie,'" Rudolph
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Did your sister ever answer?" prosecutor Doug Jones asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No, sir, she didn't," Rudolph said.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry is the third ex-Klansman to go to trial for the bombing.</TE>

<HD>Brotherly Love Is Missing in Keystone State</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Democratic primary battle for Pennsylvania
governor pits candidates with stark differences in experience and
style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The night began peacefully enough, with cold beer and steaming-hot
ribs at a local Democratic fund-raising dinner last week. Until the
banner went up.</LD>
<LD>   Then the veneer of civility came down in the bitter race for the
party's gubernatorial nomination between ex-Philadelphia Mayor Ed
Rendell and state Auditor Gen. Robert P. Casey Jr., which will be
settled in a primary Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   For more than a year, Casey and Rendell have banged heads in a
fierce contest that has exposed the deepest fault lines among
Democrats--in Pennsylvania and nationally. Casey embodies a vanishing
strain: He's an economic liberal and social conservative who quotes
Hubert H. Humphrey to justify new government programs and supports a
ban on abortion. Rendell offers a mix of economic moderation and
social liberalism similar to Bill Clinton's "New Democrat" agenda.</LD>
<TE>   These contrasts, accentuated by differences in experience and
style, have produced a race of unusual intensity and antagonism. And
when two burly Casey supporters tried to raise a sign on the stage as
their man spoke at the party dinner, that bitterness burst forth like
one of the thunderstorms rumbling outside.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Rendell--who had already spoken and left the
hall--tried to tear down the sign. The two groups jostled, the
competing supporters in the crowd chanted angrily at each other and,
for a moment, it appeared that the campaigns would settle their
accumulating grievances with fists.</TE>
<TE>   Cooler heads prevailed, the sign went up and Casey delivered his
speech--but not before the vivid demonstration of just how much this
race has split Democrats along lines of ideology, region and class.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the easiest election to understand," said Terry Madonna,
a political scientist at Pennsylvania's Millersville University. "We
have two candidates who, on almost every dimension you want to
examine, are appealing to a different constituency base within the
Democratic Party."</TE>
<TE>   The latest public polls give Rendell a lead of 5 to 10 percentage
points. But Casey's support from organized labor--which grew
alienated from Rendell when he demanded union wage givebacks to help
solve Philadelphia's budget crisis in the early 1990s--will provide
him a powerful turnout operation on election day. As a result, while
most local observers give Rendell the edge, few count out Casey.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will face Republican Atty. Gen. Mike Fisher in a state
that has leaned toward Democrats in recent presidential elections but
tends to back GOP candidates for most statewide offices.</TE>
<TE>   From almost every angle, Casey and Rendell give Democrats as clear
a choice as they ever receive.</TE>
<TE>   Rendell, 58, has been in politics long enough--first as
Philadelphia's district attorney, then as mayor from 1992 to
1999--that he lost a gubernatorial primary in 1986 to Casey's father.
The late Bob Casey went on to serve two terms as governor. The
younger Casey, 42, is serving his second term as the state auditor
general, the first elected office he's held.</TE>
<TE>   Rendell has made experience the central argument in his campaign;
Casey has tried to undermine that effort with biting television ads
denouncing his opponent's record.</TE>
<TE>   Rendell is a large man with a booming voice who doesn't so much
court voters as invade them. Mingling with the lunch crowd at a
Philadelphia mall last week, he leaned into tables, laughed loudly,
generally appeared oblivious to the concept of personal space and
left every target with the same admonition: "Don't forget to vote."</TE>
<TE>   That same day, Casey was friendly but somewhat reserved as he
shook hands at a Philadelphia supermarket accompanied by his wife and
officials from the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Casey
usually didn't approach shoppers or workers until the union officials
brought them over; often he said little more than, "Nice to see you."
Typically it was his wife, Terese, who tried to close the sale by
asking for votes.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his opposition to abortion rights, Casey is dubious
about new gun control legislation. Rendell supports legal abortion
and generally embraces gun control. Both sides, however, agree that
these issues have attracted less attention locally than nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Abortion hasn't vanished. Casey recently said it was relevant to
the race because he would sign legislation banning the procedure in
the state--except in cases of rape, incest and a danger to the life
of the mother--if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the national
right to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   But because Pennsylvania Democrats are more closely divided on
abortion than in California or New York, where the liberal position
dominates, neither side has seen much advantage in emphasizing their
disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   The two candidates have a raft of other policy differences that,
taken together, embody different generations of Democratic thought.
Casey harks back to the themes and priorities of New Deal liberalism,
while Rendell identifies more with Clinton's "third way."</TE>
<TE>   Both say the state is suffering economically. But in response,
Casey puts the greatest emphasis on strengthening the social safety
net by providing health-care coverage for more unemployed workers and
prescription drug assistance for more Pennsylvania senior citizens.
Rendell, by contrast, stresses measures meant to expand opportunity,
primarily by doubling the cigarette tax and legalizing (and then
heavily taxing) slot machines to pay for a dramatic increase in state
education funding.</TE>
<TE>   Casey wants to expand the state minimum wage; Rendell says any
increase should come at the federal level because a Pennsylvania-only
hike would hurt the state's competitiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Casey denounces Rendell for supporting the privatization of public
services and says he opposed the recent decision by a state board to
let private contractors, including for-profit companies, run dozens
of failing Philadelphia schools this fall. Rendell hails that
decision--which the teachers unions have fiercely opposed--as "a
worthwhile experiment."</TE>
<TE>   Looming over these differences are regional divisions. As happens
in many parts of the country, it's been difficult for politicians
from Pennsylvania's biggest city to win support statewide. As Rendell
readily reminds his audiences, no Philadelphian has been elected
governor since 1914. Candidates from Philadelphia also struggled in
several recent Democratic primaries because the area's voters
(especially in the suburbs) haven't turned out as heavily as voters
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the gubernatorial race is breaking sharply
along regional lines. Despite Casey's support from municipal unions
still angry over their budget battles with Rendell, the former mayor
has a huge lead in Philadelphia and its suburbs. Casey leads across
the more socially conservative northern and central parts of the
state and in much of the southwest outside the Pittsburgh area. In
and around Pittsburgh, however, Rendell is running unusually well for
a Philadelphia candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast between the two men and their coalitions makes the
race more than just a collision of ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   A Casey victory would suggest a continued advantage for the
socially conservative, organized-labor coalition that has long
defined Democratic politics in this historically industrial state. A
Rendell victory would signal a shift toward an alliance of urban
minorities and suburban moderates.</TE>
<TE>   Those stakes help explain why the race has become a wrestling
match every bit as heated as the struggle over the sign the Casey
backers hoisted the other night.</TE>

<HD>2 Charged in 1993 Slayings of 7 in Ill.</HD>
<DH>Crime: Juan Luna and James Degorski face first-degree
murder charges. They could get the death penalty for the killings at
a restaurant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PALATINE, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Two men charged with killing seven people at a fried chicken
restaurant in 1993 carefully planned the slayings, filling their
pockets with bullets and wedging the back door shut so no one could
escape, authorities said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "They just did it to do something big," Palatine Police Chief John
Koziel said. "They're people without a soul, and that's all we know
about them."</LD>
<LD>   Juan Luna, 28, and James Degorski, 29, have been charged with
seven counts of first-degree murder and could face the death penalty
if convicted.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a horrible, brutal series of murders and one that we
look at in the most serious way possible," Cook County State's Atty.
Richard Devine said.</TE>
<TE>   A judge on Saturday ordered the suspects held without bail.
Prosecutors said Luna made a videotaped confession, and Degorski
confessed orally before stopping a videotaped confession.</TE>
<TE>   The pair were arrested Thursday, two months after Degorski's
former girlfriend, a 26-year-old college student, went to police with
information she had kept secret for nearly 10 years, fearful Degorski
would kill her, said Linas Kelecius, an assistant state's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   She "is the real hero in this case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The case has been filled with twists and turns over the years,
with police and news media identifying possible breaks that never
panned out. A large task force of investigators had dwindled to just
a few officers in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite false leads in the past, Kelecius said police believed the
woman because she knew a detail never made public: One of the victims
had become ill before he died. She also allegedly knew a motive for
the slayings: that Luna allegedly wanted to kill someone and Degorski
volunteered to help, Kelecius said.</TE>
<TE>   The pair were arrested after police taped a 45-minute telephone
call the woman made to Degorski, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   During the conversation, she asked Degorski what "cover story" he
wanted her to use with police. Degorski never denied involvement and
told her what she should say, Kelecius said.</TE>
<TE>   At Saturday's bail hearing, the prosecutor revealed new details
about the grisly slayings Jan. 8, 1993, at Brown's Chicken &amp; Pasta
restaurant in Palatine, a Chicago suburb.</TE>
<TE>   He said the seven victims were shot and some were stabbed around
closing time after they had been forced inside a cooler and walk-in
refrigerator. The .38-caliber revolver used in the slayings belonged
to Degorski but was allegedly used by both men, he said. The victims
were shot a total of 24 times.</TE>
<TE>   Luna, a former restaurant employee, also was linked to the crime
by DNA evidence found on a dinner he allegedly ordered before the
murders, Kelecius said.</TE>
<TE>   Both suspects have arrest records.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this is a break we have been waiting for during the past
nine years," Jennifer Shilling, now a Democratic state representative
in Wisconsin, said Friday. Her parents, Richard and Lynn Wiese
Ehlenfeldt, owned the chicken restaurant and were among the seven
victims.</TE>

besieged Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.</LD>
<LD>   Schurr claimed that she was assaulted by Israeli soldiers, jailed
for a week without charges and forced to fly home without most of her
belongings, including filmed records of her experience with about 150
Palestinians and nine fellow foreign "peace workers" who were holed
up with little food or water inside the ancient basilica.</LD>
<LD>   But she would very much like to go back, and in a news conference
here Saturday she urged other Americans to follow her example. "I
think that if more people here really knew what was happening there,
they wouldn't be so supportive of [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel]
Sharon," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Schurr, a 33-year-old doctoral student and self-described peace
worker, is one of a small minority of non-Arab Americans who have
embraced the Palestinian cause. She traveled to the West Bank two
months ago under the auspices of the International Solidarity
Movement, which organizes nonviolent protest actions against Israeli
policies there.</TE>
<TE>   Most of its members are Europeans, but Schurr's predominantly
American contingent scored one of the movement's biggest coups this
month by sneaking into the church during the 39-day showdown between
Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen there.</TE>
<TE>   To Israelis, these pro-Palestinian visitors are an irksome
annoyance at best, and at worst a serious security risk, as officials
contemplate the political consequences of European or American
casualties in places that can quickly become free-fire zones. To
Palestinians, though, they are enthusiastically welcomed as proof of
international support.</TE>
<TE>   Limited Effect in U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the homegrown Palestinian solidarity
movement has had limited political effect so far, acknowledged Adam
Shapiro, a movement leader who joined Schurr at the news conference
Saturday. Public opinion polls show Americans overwhelmingly
supportive of Israel, and in Congress pro-Israeli sentiment runs even
higher.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro's parents received death threats after he appeared in news
broadcasts worldwide as a spokesman for the foreign activists who had
joined Yasser Arafat in his blockaded Ramallah headquarters. His
father, a math teacher, was fired last week from a part-time job at a
private Jewish academy in what the family believes was a reprisal for
his son's political activity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been called a traitor; I've been called a 'Jewish Taliban,'"
Shapiro said.</TE>
<TE>   But the publicity surrounding their recent endeavors has made it
easier to recruit Americans for solidarity missions to the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, they say. In the last few weeks alone, they have
recruited 30 volunteers in Michigan, 50 in San Francisco and 200 in
New York, all of whom hope "to work against the occupation" in the
Palestinian territories this summer, Shapiro said.</TE>
<TE>   When the Manger Square standoff finally ended, the armed men
inside the church--some from Palestinian Authority security forces,
others from local militias--were expelled to Gaza and, for 13 whose
ultimate fate still appears unclear, to Cyprus.</TE>
<TE>   Only the foreign activists were taken into Israeli custody. "I was
never arrested; I was never charged with anything," Schurr said
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Five Americans in the group remain in Israeli custody in the Ramle
prison outside Tel Aviv, according to Israeli press reports,
relatives and movement spokesmen here. Most were detained by the
Israeli army in Bethlehem's Manger Square on May 2, after they
deliberately distracted troops to let Schurr and nine colleagues
sneak into the cordoned-off church with food.</TE>
<TE>   Several still in jail are now on a hunger strike, protesting what
they consider to have been their illegal capture by Israeli forces in
Palestinian-governed central Bethlehem. But relatives and movement
associates say that the only obstacle preventing the Americans'
release is their refusal to accept an Israeli deportation order. They
are demanding written assurances from Israel that they will be able
to return to the West Bank, which can be reached only from Israel, or
through an Israeli-controlled border crossing from Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis say they are free to go," said Neil Musselman, the
father of 24-year-old Nathan Musselman, who has been fasting in
protest for 13 days. But after three years of postgraduate Arabic
studies at a West Bank university, Nathan Musselman "hopes to return
to the area to work for peace," his father said in a telephone
interview from the family's Roanoke, Va., home.</TE>
<TE>   Another jailed member of the group, Trevor Baumgartner, was
released from custody by the Israelis on Friday, reportedly after
falling ill from a prolonged fast, and arrived at his Seattle home
Saturday, according to colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't broken any rules or laws within Israel, and there is
no legal reason that they should be deported by Israel," Shapiro
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the pro-Palestinians readily admit to activities calculated to
make them unwelcome in Israel, such as handing out Hebrew- language
leaflets to Israeli soldiers that call on them to refuse service in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro met recently with his congressman, Anthony D. Weiner,
whose Brooklyn district was previously represented by Charles E.
Schumer, New York's staunchly pro-Israel senior senator. It didn't go
well.</TE>
<TE>   "He just wanted to lecture me on how misguided I am," Shapiro
said.</TE>

<HD>Study Says NYC Stress Disorder Declining</HD>
<DH>Health: Depression rose after World Trade Center attacks,
but New Yorkers are 'getting better.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. PETE BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>New Yorkers took an emotional battering after the terrorist attacks,
says a study that suggests more than 400,000 city residents have
experienced post-traumatic stress disorder.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a very large impact on the population of New York,"
said researcher Michael Bucuvalas, whose firm has extensive
experience measuring stress from disasters. "A lot of that has
persisted, but the population is getting better."</LD>
<LD>   Researchers had released results taken in October and November,
covering Manhattan below 110th Street. On Saturday, they announced
the findings from the second wave of surveys, which included
residents throughout the city during January and February.</LD>
<TE>   The number of residents who have experienced post-traumatic stress
disorder since Sept. 11 related to the attacks was put at 7%, or
425,000. The estimate of people experiencing the disorder related to
the attacks over the last month was 140,000.</TE>
<TE>   Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms include nightmares,
anxiety, irritability or outbursts of anger. The symptoms are usually
present for at least two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials say the existence of certain groups of these
symptoms qualifies as post-traumatic stress disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are conducting a third wave of interviews to include
the city's suburbs, such as Long Island and northern New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Almost half a million residents have experienced a serious episode
of depression since the attacks, and about 212,000 of those cases
were in the last month. Bucuvalas estimated about half of that was
related to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The study will also examine the effect of such a high number of
psychological stress victims on the health system.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of our analysis will focus on increased use of mental health
facilities," Bucuvalas said. "All of a sudden, half a million people
need treatment."</TE>
<TE>   The study found that Latinos were very likely to have higher rates
of the disorder, though Bucuvalas said it is unclear why. Also,
people who had experienced other stressful situations were more
likely to have the disorder.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the disorder has persisted because they were used to
seeing the twin towers each day, either from work or home.</TE>
<TE>   The study is being done in conjunction with the New York Academy
of Medicine. Funding for this wave of the research was supplied by
the Sept. 11 Fund, the Commonwealth Fund and the National Institute
on Drug Abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The results were released at the annual meeting here of the
American Assn. for Public Opinion Research. The survey is being done
by the New York research firm Schulman, Ronca &amp; Bucuvalas Inc.</TE>

<HD>Bolsa Chica Fight Isn't Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Orange County's longest-running controversies--what to do with
the Bolsa Chica mesa and wetlands--took another unexpected turn this
month when the Orange County Planning Commission approved
construction of 388 luxury houses on land overlooking the north end
of the estuary.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal marked yet another reduction from the original
development plan that would have blanketed Bolsa Chica with a marina,
hotels and 5,700 homes.</LD>
<LD>   The latest iteration won't end the long-running land dispute. This
is, after all, Bolsa Chica. Proponents of an outright ban on
development at the site will appeal the commission's decision to the
Board of Supervisors. The developer is heading into a courtroom to
fight a California Coastal Commission decision that severely
restricted its development rights.</LD>
<TE>   This argument has been raging for more than 30 years--a figure
that approaches the median age of county residents.</TE>
<TE>   One overriding truth is that Bolsa Chica's heritage as a natural
gem is going to be preserved. Despite significant environmental
damage, the 1,200-acre wetlands is an important refuge for migratory
birds and endangered species, including chatty California least terns
that nest there each May.</TE>
<TE>   A big piece of the Bolsa Chica puzzle was solved last year when
the state, which now owns 800 acres of the wetlands, announced plans
for a $100-million restoration plan. The agreement guarantees that
the wetlands won't dissolve into a mirror image of the upscale
Huntington Harbour development just north of Warner Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the thornier problem of an acceptable level of
development on the so-called lower and upper mesas, land near Warner
Avenue that overlooks the wetlands. The attitude among those who
oppose any construction is summed up in a line from a recent letter
to the editor: "Compromise is not acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   The next move is up to Signal Landmark, the landowner that had
hoped to build more than 1,000 homes on the 230-acre mesa. The state
Coastal Commission in November limited development to 65 acres on the
upper area of the mesa, a move that prompted the lawsuit alleging
that the commission's development restrictions effectively have
"taken" the land away.</TE>
<TE>   Development opponents might be hoping to hear a judicial response
that echoes a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision involving
property-rights advocates in Lake Tahoe. The landowners in that case
unsuccessfully argued that the government owed them "just
compensation" because development restrictions had prevented them
using their land during a construction moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   Signal Landmark hopes to recoup costs of buying the land and
planning for development by squeezing a check out of the state
Coastal Commission. If the court challenge fails, it would mean that
a sale of land once slated for development would make more sense than
ever. It could be time for Signal Landmark and development opponents
to discuss a fair purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   Those who wish to see the land saved from development must be
prepared to come to the table with a realistic proposal. Signal
Landmark, aware of the proposed project's history of delays and
reversals, should come to the table ready to negotiate. The question
remains, at what price can a deal be done?</TE>

<HD>A Creative Housing Solution</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach is a nice place to live, not only for its picturesque
coastal setting, but also for its many places to eat, drink and spend
money. And don't forget those wonderful police officers, teachers,
cleaning crews and bank clerks who make the city work.</LD>
<LD>   Those who tackle the necessities of life in Laguna Beach, however,
face a frustrating dearth of affordable housing in this oceanfront
playground. If it were just Laguna Beach, it might be an easily
contained problem. But many South County cities deserve criticism for
their failure to push developers to include more low-income housing
projects.</LD>
<LD>   No one expects a breakthrough any time soon in a city where the
median price of a house has soared to $707,000. The creative thinking
behind the proposed 30-unit apartment building on Glenneyre Street,
however, shows that upscale communities can make a ripple in a county
where rents average $1,100 and the vacancy rate has plunged to 2%.</LD>
<TE>   The $4.8-million apartment complex will stand on land that the
city purchased about four years ago. Laguna Beach's creative solution
to the lack of affordable housing stemmed from a decision to buy the
land with fees collected from developers who had made payments in
lieu of including affordable housing in their developments.</TE>
<TE>   Funding is coming from the county, Laguna Beach, the developer and
the contractor. All but one of the new apartment units will be
reserved for people who earn 40% or less than the county's median
income, or about $30,350. The last unit will be reserved for a
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Buying land, and then funding construction with money supplied by
a consortium of private and public sources, represents a small step
toward ensuring that the some of the city's working poor can enjoy a
comfortable home without enduring a long and possibly dangerous
commute.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 units being created in Laguna Beach aren't enough to blunt
criticisms that the city isn't doing its part to provide affordable
housing for the working poor. It does, however, illustrate how the
county's municipalities can use creative solutions to provide
affordable housing even when developers won't do so.</TE>

<HD>Time to Escalate the War on AIDS</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>PEARL JEMISON-SMITH</AU>
<BD>Pearl Jemison-Smith is a founding board member of the
AIDS Services Foundation, and co-chair of AIDS Walk Orange County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Declaration of Independence states that life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness are inalienable rights. We as a nation stress
saving lives. We are concerned about driving as a risky activity so
we have seat belts, air bags and speed limits. After Sept. 11, we
acted rapidly to put security measures in place, spending millions of
dollars and increasing manpower.</LD>
<LD>   These are obvious and sensible reactions to a horrific event. For
20-plus years we have been terrorized by HIV/AIDS. The federal
government responded with the Ryan White CARE Act to save lives by
funding medical care, medication, social services. However, an
all-out effort to stop the spread of the disease by a well-funded
national plan based on scientific theory has not occurred.</LD>
<LD>   In Orange County we have more than 6,000 AIDS cases. Santa Ana,
with 948 cases and 492 deaths, has been particularly hard hit. The
term "case" diminishes the reality that we are talking about
people--men, women and children. These are people with full-blown
AIDS; the number of HIV cases is unavailable.</LD>
<TE>   As of July 1, HIV will become a reportable disease, which will
finally demonstrate the magnitude and direction of the epidemic.
Every year 40,000 new infections occur in the United States. Every
hour, two teenagers become infected with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   What are we doing in response to this deadly threat? We are
teaching abstinence, telling teenagers and young people with normal
sexual drives to become celibate.</TE>
<TE>   "Just Say No" didn't work for the drug war, and it won't work as a
stand-alone message now to prevent the spread of HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, encouraging abstinence as one component of prevention
is important. But specific, targeted, repeated information and
effective prevention strategies are needed.</TE>
<TE>   On May 3, The Times reported on a study conducted by Planned
Parenthood that in Orange County 44% of Latino males are reporting
their first sexual intercourse by age 14 and 35% of Latinas by age
15. Other ethnic groups were not studied, but with the rate of
teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases it becomes
obvious that abstinence is not an effective message.</TE>
<TE>   What can we do locally? Get the facts about how HIV is spread.
Talk to your children about the consequences, as well as the personal
and moral responsibilities of being sexually active. Go to your
school boards and demand that the mandated HIV/AIDS education
programs are provided and that abstinence is not the only message.
Urge your state legislator to pass AB 2768, a bill that sets minimum
standards for HIV/AIDS prevention instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Urge your federal and state elected officials to increase
prevention funds and not allow cuts in the budget. You also can get
involved with AIDS Walk on June 2 at UC Irvine. Funds raised go to
eight agencies that provide programs including prevention education
and direct client care. The walk supplements federal and state funds
coming into the county.</TE>
<TE>   In the current economic and political climate, fund-raising is
more difficult. So join the 15,000 people expected to walk to help

<DL></DL>
<LD>A dark cloud of mistrust hangs over Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   So all-encompassing is the mistrust county residents feel toward
their local government that it prevents them from supporting actions
they truly desire. Worsening traffic and crowding, beach closures,
the bankruptcy and other assaults on their quality of life leave
Orange County residents frustrated and turned off.</LD>
<LD>   They believe their county is badly mismanaged, and they do not
trust local government's ability to correct itself. As a consequence,
they are wary of even the most appealing programs to improve traffic,
housing and Orange County's frayed infrastructure.</LD>
<TE>   This is one of the insights from a series of three daylong
dialogues conducted in February with representative cross-sections of
Orange County residents on how to cope with growth in the county. The
Orange County Business Council sponsored the project and La
Jolla-based Viewpoint Learning Inc. conducted the citizen dialogues.</TE>
<TE>   The dialogues also revealed that the mistrust should not be
mistaken for apathy. The crust of suspicion, pessimism, isolation and
NIMBY sentiment is actually quite thin. Beneath it, the researchers
found a fierce desire for greater engagement and getting things done.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of their diversity of viewpoints, Orange County residents
find common ground on a number of key points:</TE>
<TE>   * Anger at the disconnection between citizens and government.</TE>
<TE>   * A hunger for continued engagement.</TE>
<TE>   * A conviction that growth should not be left to chance or to
short-term circumstances, but be part of a long-term plan with
housing, traffic and infrastructure improvements closely integrated.</TE>
<TE>   * Support for genuine partnerships among government, business and
the community to reconnect government to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Participants devoted intense effort to learning about growth and
its consequences. They returned again and again to the pros and cons
of trying to hold back growth versus taking proactive positions on
ways to ameliorate traffic, improve infrastructure and move toward
regionwide decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   Participants willingly accepted the rules of dialogue rather than
debate. Given the opportunity, two of the three dialogues were able
to move on to construct positive scenarios for the future. In one, it
proved difficult to move beyond venting, showing how difficult the
situation in Orange County is.</TE>
<TE>   The dialogues had some serendipitous side effects. Participants
enjoyed talking with one another. They generated a sense of
community, and they offer the hope of revitalizing public engagement.</TE>
<TE>   So how do we translate this information into action? Where are the
opportunities for leadership?</TE>
<TE>   Orange County residents have told us their agenda: dissatisfaction
with the status quo, mistrust of government and institutions, and a
desire to focus on our common infrastructure priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, beneath the mistrust was a strong desire for more
effective political leadership that they can trust. The challenge, as
well as the opportunity, is to build on that underlying support. The
biggest clue the dialogues have given us is that if we continue to
engage the public on these issues, trust and credibility can be
rebuilt in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Residents liked best the option that focuses on infrastructure as
the highest priority for Orange County's future. They recognized a
direct connection between aging and inadequate infrastructure and our
problems with pollution and beach closures.</TE>
<TE>   After considering the ramifications of various options for Orange
County's future, participants said they would be willing to spend
more to support our common infrastructure, through reallocation of
resources or increased taxes.</TE>
<TE>   However, their support was contingent on more accountability,
better planning and a clear investment strategy. Residents wanted to
be sure that the dollars would actually go to fund these priorities
and that taxpayers would get their money's worth from the new and
improved infrastructure systems.</TE>
<TE>   We believe that the widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo
in Orange County opens the door for new ways of looking at our common
future, including the creation of a neutral body that explores
public-private partnerships in the area of infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   We're calling this new organization the Center for a New Orange
County. It will convene Orange County residents, elected officials,
government leaders and the business community to engage in a dialogue
to find greater common ground about priorities for Orange County's
future.</TE>
<TE>   The most important tool for finding this common ground is an
effort by the center to promote civic engagement and dialogue among
all Orange County citizens. Without those things, the county will
continue to experience a climate of mistrust, indifference and
gridlock. With them, it can build sustained public support for
innovative, collaborative initiatives, such as infrastructure, that
benefit long-term countywide prosperity.</TE>

<HD>The Season of Their Discontent</HD>
<DH>THE CITY OF YOUR FINAL DESTINATION, A Novel, By Peter
Cameron, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 312 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARINA BUDHOS</AU>
<BD>Marina Budhos is the author of two novels, "House of
Waiting" and "The Professor of Light."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It takes a certain sleight of hand to write a novel that is so
suffused in place, yet one in which place is largely absent from its
pages. Peter Cameron's "The City of Your Final Destination" is set in
the deep forest of Uruguay. However, this remote locale is almost
incidental to the novel; the real focus is the relations among a
group of eccentric characters, who are all disconnected--from their
homes, their pasts, even from themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Razaghi, an Iranian-born, hapless graduate student, sets off
to Uruguay to gain permission to write the biography of Jules Gund, a
Jewish writer who committed suicide after publishing a masterpiece,
"The Gondola." There, Omar encounters an odd trio: Gund's widow, his
mistress and his brother, all of whom live on a crumbling family
estate and are caught in a state of suspended animation, as if Jules
had put the pistol to his head only yesterday.</LD>
<LD>   They are like characters in a Chekhov play, only they don't have a
Moscow to dream of. The family's gondola, now sunk in mud and weeds
next to a lake, is the central image of rot and stasis, and it is
into this swamp that the clumsy, innocent Omar stumbles.</LD>
<TE>   What's sly about this novel is that the bigger dramas are kept
offstage. After all, there is a dead writer, a wife and mistress who
live in the same house but barely speak and the possibility of
smuggled goods from Nazi Germany through Adam, the bitter and
sardonic brother. Though this is the stuff of melodrama and thriller,
Cameron has crafted a fascinating domestic drama as if he wanted to
settle down in the courtyard and listen to these people talk, snared
in their suffocating web of old hostilities. The novel often reads
like a play as the characters wander around the dilapidated set,
quarreling and quibbling, and getting nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron's sketch of the passive Omar is dead-on: "I am afraid I am
very cowed by reality," he admits to Caroline, the mistress, when he
is supposed to be convincing her of the merit of his biography
project. So is his portrait of Omar's annoying and willful
girlfriend, Deirdre, who shows up when Omar has an accident, and only
makes matters worse.</TE>
<TE>   Deirdre is the only character who does not seem a part of this
hermetic world, and who believes she can direct fate, only to botch
up everything. "These people are awful," she thinks at one point.
"They're all thwarted and poisonous. They need lots of therapy."</TE>
<TE>   Arch, ironic, "The City of Your Final Destination" also succeeds
as a comedy of manners that pokes fun at literary careerism and turns
entertainingly on the testy exchanges between people who are not
happy, and would not admit it if they were. I kept envisioning this
as a cross between a West End Edwardian play with characters hitting
the dusty pillows and flinging themselves into chairs, and a
Merchant-Ivory production in which the lush visuals would fill in.
When Adam asks Deirdre about Omar, it becomes a game of
double-entendre:</TE>
<TE>   "'And how is he?'</TE>
<TE>   "'He seems well, considering.'</TE>
<TE>   "'Considering what?'</TE>
<TE>   "'Considering his accident,' said Deirdre.</TE>
<TE>   "'Aren't we all.'</TE>
<TE>   "'Aren't we all what?' asked Deirdre.</TE>
<TE>   "'Aren't we all well, considering our accidents,' said Adam.</TE>
<TE>   "Deirdre did not reply."</TE>
<TE>   Omar's dreamy, intuitive nature eventually leads him toward a
career and life that make sense. And ever so gently, without meaning
to, he is the one who tilts everyone toward their final destination.
This quiet unfolding is Cameron's most subtle--and
grand--achievement. For it is the ill-equipped Omar who magically
holds the power to bring change to others, and it is his story we
ultimately cheer.</TE>
<TE>   The spirit of poet Elizabeth Bishop comes to play a nice, literary
role in the book, and her famous line--"Should we have stayed at
home, wherever that may be?"--hovers gently over these dispossessed
souls.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron has always had a delicate touch that harks back to the
minimalist writers of the '80s who, with one devastating stroke of a
line, could evoke an entire substrata of emotions. But this technique
can sometimes feel a bit thin, for so much takes place in the here
and now that we rarely glimpse the memories that lie beneath the
surface.</TE>
<TE>   In a novel that is so much about characters trapped by the past, I
could have used a stronger sense of the writer Gund, who exerted such
power over everyone. The triangle of the mistress and wife is only
glancingly referred to, and we never quite grasp how these two women
came to live under the same roof, and how they could bear it.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron is almost too modest in his uncovering; too careful in
avoiding the implied melodrama. I wouldn't have minded a little more
of the muck that covers and traps them all.</TE>

<DH>ON A WAVE: By Thad Ziolkowski, Atlantic Monthly Press: 260
pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN FREEMAN</AU>
<BD>John Freeman writes for the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and the Washington Post Book World.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Afew years ago, Thad Ziolkowski crashed into middle age jobless and
out of shape. "I had an armchair slouch," the poet and onetime surfer
admits in his debut, "On a Wave." "My hair, once bright, was a lank
dishwater blond; teeth yellow from Camel Lights; pad of fat around my
waist, care of Guinness."</LD>
<LD>   Fed up with this crummy existence, Ziolkowski headed to Queens'
Far Rockaway Beach one day, thinking a glimpse of a wave, however
oily and small, might rejuvenate him. He strolled into a surf shop
and inhaled the odors of neoprene and resin. All at once, memories of
his childhood came flooding back.</LD>
<LD>   Thus begins Ziolkowski's evocative memoir of growing up in the
late 1960s, when surfing was his religion and the ocean his "pagan
cathedral." The book proper begins in 1968, when Thad is 8 and his
family moves from Alabama to Florida's eastern shoreline. Although
his mother and her moody boyfriend, Pat, are excited by this fresh
start, Thad isn't too thrilled. He enrolls in Apollo Elementary; pale
and pudgy in a land of bronzed skin, he is taunted by other students.</LD>
<TE>   Due to this snubbing, Thad gravitates toward the beach, where
older teenagers suck down joints before paddling out into the waves.
For months, Thad begs his mother to buy him a board so he too can
surf. On his 10th birthday, he finally gets one, and through steady
emulation, learns to stand up on it. Soon he is throwing in twists,
leaping off the lip of waves and riding all the way to shore.</TE>
<TE>   As his skills progress, surfing becomes Thad's obsession, and
Ziolkowski beautifully captures the way the sport defined his life.
It's an occult world with free-love undertones. Every day, Thad rubs
Sex Wax on his Plastic Fantastic, zips into a wetsuit and surfs until
his eyeballs bleed. When he and his friends ride bicycles, they
imagine they're on their boards, tracing miniature S-shapes on the
pavement. At night they fall asleep in their swimming trunks,
"whispering about waves and surf stars."</TE>
<TE>   Like Daniel Duane's 1996 memoir "Caught Inside," "On a Wave" goes
beyond the lore of the sport and brings to life its natural venue. At
first, the beach seems a strange and dangerous place to Thad. "It's
littered with Portuguese man-of-wars, electric-blue tentacles snarled
on the sand. The flotillas writhe and stretch, gleaming like internal
organs." Over time, though, it evolves into a place of holy
tranquillity. One morning, the sky is an "Arctic blue, so high and
stretched so thin that it seems on the verge of vanishing, of
revealing all."</TE>
<TE>   Though Ziolkowski's language is as brisk and frothy as Hawaiian
surf, what makes this memoir so affecting is how he mines his
emotional life as a child. At first surfing is a way for Thad to duck
Pat's volcanic mood swings. Yet after Pat and his mother marry, Thad
dedicates himself to developing a keener understanding of the man.
After all, Pat is the one who comes with him to buy the first board;
later, when Thad spills, Pat is there to patch him up.</TE>
<TE>   As Thad nears the end of high school, his surfing nearly becomes
his occupation. If he keeps going, he's looking at a pro career. But
before Thad can make a decision that might change his life forever,
Pat gets a job in Wichita, Kan., and the family abruptly abandons the
beach for a landof silos and endless horizons.</TE>
<TE>   This may sound like a pretty standard turning point of
adolescence--forfeiting that which one has known for something
new--but given how effectively Ziolkowski conjures his boyhood world,
it's hard not to wince at this leave-taking. It's also easy to
understand why, from a distance of nearly 30 years, Ziolkowski sat
down and put pen to paper to bring it all back again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `On a Wave'</TE>
<TE>   I wrapped the leash around my ankle, peeled off my shirt and ran
down the sand. The man and two kids stopped digging to watch me
plunge into the shallows like a horse.</TE>
<TE>   The warm foamy water splattered my thighs and baggies. I held the
board out in front of me and leapt, floating briefly, and when I came
down and started paddling, a deep Ahhhh! rose from me like a vapor,
all the toxins of New York, the cigarette smoke and second-guessing,
alcohol and elbow-throwing and worry about work. Every cell in my
body opened its mouth in astonishment and sang with happiness.</TE>
<TE>   This truly was the same Atlantic I'd grown up in. The rhythm of
the water, the way the waves mobbed through the bluish later
afternoon light--it was like opening a book to a poem I'd memorized
in childhood.</TE>
<TE>   After a minute, a wedge-shaped peak lurched up in front of me. I
turned and paddled for shore. I noticed the pressure of my chest on
the board, the spray in my face, a blade of light on the glassy
surface below.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as it gathered me up, I hopped to my feet. It was going to
be a short ride. Sucking everything up into itself, the wave prepared
to close out in shallow, sand-choked water.</TE>
<TE>   My mind went blank; I leaned into a turn and rose back up the face
of the wave. Then, without really deciding to, I attempted an
off-the-lip--which was a bit like climbing on a bike for the first
time in forever and trying to pop a wheelie.</TE>
<TE>   But I did it. Or rather, it did itself: the nose of the board
punched through the crest of the wave and snapped back around and at
the bottom I stayed on my feet, bouncing up and down in knee-high
white water before flopping off the board.</TE>
<TE>   When I surfaced, another jet was bearing down on Queens. I'd
forgotten where I was.</TE>
<TE>   I looked back at the beach--at the housing projects, the man and
kids. It was all still there, of course, but I was seeing it as
through a membrane. Land no longer seemed real.</TE>
<TE>   The ocean did, though. Even here at the foot of a crumbling
Babylon, it was alive and well.</TE>

<DH>A MEMOIR OF NO ONE IN PARTICULAR: In Which Our Author
Indulges in Naive Indiscretions, a Self-Aggrandizing Solipsism, and
an Off-Putting Infatuation With His Own Bodily Functions, By Daniel
Harris Basic Books: 240 pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GILES</AU>
<BD>Patrick Giles is associate editor of Interview
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Well what's to be done about our 'lives' I wonder?" Virginia Woolf
asked her diary in 1934. It was not the living of lives she was
considering but the writing of them. She was even more astonishingly
perceptive than usual when contemplating the daunting synergy of
honesty, insight and persuasiveness needed to write one's own story:</LD>
<LD>   "After all," Woolf wrote 11 years earlier, "in the whole of
literature, how many people have succeeded in drawing themselves with
a pen? Only Montaigne and Pepys and Rousseau, perhaps."</LD>
<LD>   What would Woolf think of today's abundant literature of memory
(some call it self-centeredness) which has managed to crowd (some
fear diminish) our novels, drama and poetry? Would she approve of the
legions picking up their pens to turn piles of empty pages into
mirrors?</LD>
<TE>   Daniel Harris fiercely engages this autobiographical downpour in
"A Memoir of No One in Particular," in which he eschews the usual
strategies of chronology, sensitivity and confession, aspiring
instead to an alternatively sharp and "impersonal" view of himself.</TE>
<TE>   "When I began to write this book, I viewed it as a satirical
attack on the recent fashion for memoirs," he begins. He thought he
could best convey himself by writing not the traditional (and often
self-congratulatory) trial-to-triumph account, but by undertaking a
scrutiny of his habits, appearance and environment: "a memoir without
time, an account of a man without a past."</TE>
<TE>   But his opinions and memories, almost as if talking among
themselves, organize into narrative. The difficulty of sticking to
his original plan should have alerted Harris that his writing had
commandeered an agenda of its own. "The thick armor of vanity," he
writes, "that protects my ego from the knowledge of its own
insignificance has at least been pierced by the dawning realization
... that I will probably never secure the audience that I once
believed I would reach." This reads almost as the writer's hand
turning upon itself, and an unfair verdict on an author with plenty
of opportunities left who has already produced one admirable book
("The Rise and Fall of Gay Culture") and some worthy essays.</TE>
<TE>   The self-dismay strengthens with each sentence: "Perhaps even here
I am simply making a case for myself, expressing resentment, railing
against the injustice of neglect, begging for my fifteen minutes of
fame. But if there is a chip on my shoulder, I must remove it." For
the next 200 pages, chip away he does. We're almost blinded by an
onslaught of data on Harris' aging body, peculiar habits, his
pretensions and inadequacies--almost all angrily, unrepentantly
unpleasant: "I am a remarkably unsensual person whose attitude toward
sex is aridly intellectual" or "My drag routines form an essential
part of a lifelong campaign of self-deprecation in which I vilify
myself as a 'fat old fag.'"</TE>
<TE>   Quotes like these can be giddily iconoclastic. But an entire book
of embarrassing breast-beating that leads to nothing but a
confirmation of their correctness? Something besides satire or candor
is being written here, perhaps without the author's informed consent.</TE>
<TE>   This memoir's unrelieved obsession with unattractiveness and
inadequacy suggests its real purpose might be punishment--of its
author for not being the writer he wants to be, and of his readers
for not validating those literary dreams. Some will find this
impressive; but it's hard not to see "A Memoir of No One in
Particular" as a deceptively excoriating example of the very
navel-gazing that has come to make autobiography something of a joke.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of hard-line approach to the self has been attempted
before (most successfully in Michel Leiris' "Manhood"); but the
harshness of Harris' book has a particular familiarity. Anyone who's
done time in 12-step or self-help groups will recognize this kind of
haughty, furtively seething lament hissed by group members thrashing
in self-dissatisfaction while relishing the secret pleasures such
misery confers (to say nothing of the admiration--"so brave,"
"movingly honest"--it provokes).</TE>
<TE>   (The book's accumulated sourness also makes one wonder why
positive attributes seem so far from its author's attention.)</TE>
<TE>   Harris' book frustrates because he seems to be more than capable
of a large-scale scrutiny of the self-memorializing frenzy. There are
many critical and cultural questions this phenomenon raises.Amid this
country's collapse of shared religious and social beliefs, it seems
that being celebrated (or at least noticed) by millions of strangers
is our version of immortality--and being noticed for suffering
(whether from identity or experiences) our post-religious sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   Woolf was drawn like one of her fictional moths to a flame by the
generosity of autobiography. "I sometimes think only autobiography is
literature--novels are what we peel off, and come at last to the
core, which is only you or me," she wrote a fellow writer.</TE>
<TE>   Woolf was our last great commentator on self-literature--and we
need a newer one. Perhaps, having vented so many frustrations so
thoroughly, Harris can now investigate what has made writing about
ourselves  a far more popular assignment than developing the products
of our imaginations--those overshadowed fictions that free writers
and readers from self-consciousness, only to leave us, after their
last pages, readier to contemplate who we really are.</TE>

<HD>The Name Behind the Face</HD>
<DH>THE SHORT SWEET DREAM OF EDUARDO GUTIERREZ, By Jimmy
Breslin, Crown: 214 pp., $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It began as a routine news story: In November 1999, an undocumented
Mexican worker was killed when part of a condominium complex under
construction collapsed in Brooklyn. He was on the third floor, which
plunged to the basement, where he drowned in wet concrete 3 feet
deep. He was 21.</LD>
<LD>   Then the story, from a media standpoint, became sexy. Big names
and deep-seated corruption were involved. The condos collapsed
because the developer, Eugene Ostreicher, was cutting corners. New
York City building inspectors' warnings about shoddy construction
went unheeded. Ostreicher and his son, Richie, were major
contributors to then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani's chief of staff, Bruce Teitelbaum, a Jewish Republican,
"was the major fund-raiser for Giuliani in the Hasidic communities."
The Hasidim, who fled Eastern Europe after the Holocaust, included
Ostreicher, an immigrant from Romania. Teitelbaum, according to Jimmy
Breslin's brief but passionate account of the case, was "the
connection, the pull, the clout, in the city administration ... there
were no rules for a builder, particularly in Hasidic neighborhoods,
other than putting up money on demand for politicians."</LD>
<TE>   Nor did Democrats look any better. Just down the street from the
collapsed condos, another Hasidic sect--belying the otherworldliness
implied by its black Old World garb--set up a phantom "university" in
the '80s and bilked the federal government of $40 million in Pell
grants. Some of the money was funneled to religious schools. Some
went to the organizers' bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   After a 1999 trial, four members of the sect went to prison but
had their sentences commuted by President Clinton. The sect voted
overwhelmingly for Hillary Rodham Clinton in her Senate race. This
much--the celebrities, the scandals--we can imagine any competent
reporter putting together. But Breslin does more. In 40 years as a
syndicated columnist and as the author of several books of fiction
and nonfiction, including "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight" and
"I Don't Want to Go to Jail," he has shown a strong Populist bent.
He's a writer who would rather get out from behind his desk to mingle
on the streets and in the saloons with ordinary people and hear their
stories.</TE>
<TE>   And so it is that "The Short Sweet Dream of Eduardo Gutierrez"
tells the story of the man whose death had previously been only a
footnote: the Mexican construction worker. Breslin gives him back his
name--Tomas Eduardo Daniel Gutierrez--and explains how he came to be
lifting sacks of cement onto that third floor whose shaking, he'd
confided in phone calls to the woman he loved, had frightened him for
days.</TE>
<TE>   Breslin visits Gutierrez's birthplace, San Matias Cuatchatyotla, a
dusty town near Puebla whose main industry is brickyards. Gutierrez
started working there at age 4, lugging a single cement roofing slate
at a time. Painfully shy, he never officially declared his feelings
for teenage Silvia Tecpoyotti, whose own quest for "the Job" led her
across the border to College Station, Texas, where she worked 65
hours a week at two restaurants, earning $420 (a rich person's salary
in Mexico) and thinking "it was glorious" until word of his death
came.</TE>
<TE>   Breslin interviews Guiterrez's relatives and reminds us of how, to
the Mexican poor, even substandard wages in the United States seem
like a fortune. (Ostreicher was paying Gutierrez a third of union
scale.) Breslin goes to the border and describes the flood of people
trying to cross, the hardships they endure, the risks they run as
stepped-up enforcement at urban checkpoints forces them into the
desert.</TE>
<TE>   Breslin weighs in on the immigration debate--squarely on the side
of the immigrant. He scoffs at the government's claims that it can
stop the flood of people (much less the flood of drugs). "The Border
Patrol," he says, "is the most untruthful of government agencies
after the White House."</TE>
<TE>   He fingers a central American hypocrisy: the "worship of commerce
that piles money to the sky and makes all good people rich"
accompanying "an older belief ... of the Puritans, who came to run
the morals of a nation ... their teachings that dourness is good and
laughter is bad still cause Washington to make the control of
strangers of great importance. If they are not white, then they come
from the devil."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't impartial journalism, but it's a precious kind that
threatens to die out with Breslin's generation. When only the
celebrity chasers are left, who will tell of the next Eduardo
Gutierrez--a young man whose life nobody bothers to protect because
he's "illegal" and brown-skinned, but who is "the most invaluable
part of the economy of the world ... cheap labor"?</TE>

<DH>WEALTH AND DEMOCRACY: A Political History of the American
Rich, By Kevin Phillips, Broadway Books: 474 pp. $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>Paul Kennedy is the author of numerous books, including
"The Rise and Fall of Great Powers: Economic Change and Military
Conflict From 1500 to 2000." He is a history professor at Yale
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a truth universally acknowledged that as individuals become
more successful, more established and older, they generally become
more attached to a socio-economic order that rewards success. It is
unusual and extraordinary, therefore, for an individual, while living
comfortably, to grow increasingly critical of the existing order.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the case with Kevin Phillips, who has been one of the most
distinguished and thought-provoking commentators on the American
political scene for more than 30 years. With roots firmly anchored in
the Republican Party, Phillips became a young chief political analyst
during the 1968 presidential campaign, which culminated in Richard
Nixon's victory. In light of that campaign, he wrote his first major
work, "The Emerging Republican Majority" in 1969, a daring book that
peered through the tumults of radical protest, the women's movement,
human-rights campaigns and antiwar feelings to see that the
Democratic party was losing much of its traditional base and that the
South and West could fall increasingly into the Republicans' lap.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-one years and four books later, a different sort of
Phillips emerged in the form of "The Politics of Rich and Poor." The
title itself was a giveaway: In some Republican circles, the mere
mention of "the poor" is bad form, but here was Phillips discussing
the socioeconomic clefts that had emerged by the end of the Reagan
era and raising the issue of fairness. This did not cause the already
rich and successful to pause, nor did those who frantically
endeavored to emulate them during the Wall Street boom of the 1990s
lose their eagerness to become rich. It did, however, make Phillips
something of a maverick and a doomsayer. One critic called him a
Nostradamus. Cassandra might have been better.</TE>
<TE>   If that book made the defenders of great riches and low taxes
irritable, "Wealth and Democracy" will give them apoplexy. Phillips'
new book is subtitled "A Political History of the American Rich," and
so it ranges back to the late 18th century, chronicling the growth of
the great family fortunes, like those of the Vanderbilts, the Astors,
the Rockefellers and the Morgans through the hurly-burly of gaining
and spending wealth in the last century. The reading is wide but not
exhaustive, and the narrative is complex because it is more thematic
than chronological. There are lively chapters on political influence,
corruption and speculative bubbles, others on the role of technology
and the sources of wealth. But this is no mere social history of the
wealthy in America. It comes with a punch.</TE>
<TE>   At one level, what Phillips says is predictable. It follows "The
Politics of Rich and Poor" but with even more power and more
statistics, drawing upon census figures and other data that point to
the ever-increasing unevenness of American incomes as the 1990s
unfolded. The broad trends are well known, though they are presented
in withering detail here.</TE>
<TE>   Top executives, who in general were content with earning around 40
times their workers' average pay a quarter-century ago, were in many
cases pocketing more than 200 times by the end of the last decade.
Successful company leaders were awarded, by grateful boards, annual
compensations that leaped ever higher. In an amazing chart titled
"Up, Up and Away," Phillips shows that while the highest-earning
executive in 1981 made a then-mind-boggling $5.7 million, his
equivalent in 1988 received $40 million, and his successor to that
title in 2000--John Reed of Citigroup--accepted $290 million in
compensation. Tax breaks and special concessions for special
interests--agriculture, oil and gas--were negotiated with an obliging
Congress. Welfare mothers, by contrast, lost out, as did virtually
all other vulnerable elements of our society. Tens of millions of
Americans live under the poverty line, without the basic welfare net
that is commonplace in Canada and Europe. Though this imbalance of
wealth does not exist in any other Western society, it is commonplace
in corrupt regimes in the developing world, like Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Within a short while, free-market economists and conservative
professors will be wheeled out in droves to attempt to pick holes in
Phillips' statistics and to demolish his arguments. But such a
reaction to prove Phillips wrong may miss two important aspects of
"Wealth and Democracy."</TE>
<TE>   The current celebration of wealth in this country is nothing less
than an abdication of the philosophies of some of the greatest
Republican leaders, Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt, who were the
most unrestrained in their condemnation of excessive concentrations
of wealth, of its capacity to corrupt true democracy and of the need
to rein in its excesses and to pay more attention to the country's
social fabric. In his preface, Phillips quotes from a stunning Nov.
21, 1864, private letter from Lincoln in which the president sounds
eerily like George McGovern or Ralph Nader when he confesses his
worry and trembling that "as a result of the war, corporations have
been enthroned, and an era of corruption in high places will follow,
and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign
by working upon the prejudices of the people...."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips has a similar field day in quoting statement after
statement from Roosevelt reiterating the opinion that labor is more
deserving of support than capital and that too much wealth in the
hands of a small minority is not only offensive to the American sense
of fairness, it is dangerous to the republic itself. Excess money, in
this view, purchases special privileges, corrupts low-paid officials
and distorts the electoral will. In a narrower sense, it is also
dangerous to the Republican Party, which brings us back to where
Phillips started off his long career.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the niftier sections of "Wealth and Democracy," we are
reminded that Nixon was in favor of higher taxation of unearned
income, as opposed to earned income, and increased subsidies for the
poor. Such embarrassing details are assembled not by someone who has
drifted into the ranks of the Democratic party but by a Republican
who thinks his own party has lost its roots and its decency.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips then goes on to argue that such excesses of wealth and
greed and inequity have helped bring down--or may even have been the
chief cause in bringing down--virtually all flourishing great powers
in the past and that the United States will be no exception. More
than in any previous work, the author has scoured the history of
other countries (Rome, the Dutch republic, the British empire) to
prove his point, and his examples are convincing. For all the claims
of American exceptionalism and for all the evidence around us of this
country's preeminence in the fields of military, economic and
technological power, Phillips assembles too many troubling historical
analogies for the reader to shrug off his point. The Dutch in their
golden age of the early 18th century, and the staggeringly rich
landowners and bankers of late Victorian Britain were, though they
did not know it, not far from their slow demise.</TE>
<TE>   This is, then, a call to action. The political analyst of 30 years
ago has become the soothsayer, social critic and economic reformer of
the early 21st century. Predictions nearly a half century ago about
the spreading grip of the Republican Party have been replaced by
stern warnings that this very party is treading on dangerous waters
and harming the American democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Wealth and Democracy" is a brave book. It will be interesting to
see how it fares as this year's election campaigning develops. But my
guess is that it will outlast most of the cant that passes as
political discourse today, and we will be better for it.</TE>

<HD>Three Questions for Kevin Phillips</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: When did "class" become the third rail of American
politics?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Conservatives tried to make class conflict something to
frown on in 1896 and 1932, but without great luck. The turning point
came when the success of the New Deal greatly reduced the share of
wealth and income going to the top 1%, and as democracy and a
middle-class ethos carried into the 1950s and 1960s, "plutocracy"
began to seem like an old threat that no longer existed. Now the
concept of an economic "over-class" is as relevant again as it was in
1896.</LD>
<LD>   Q: To what extent does the health of America's democracy rest on a
prosperous middle class, and how seriously is that prosperity
compromised by a widening gap in relative wealth?</LD>
<TE>   A: Plato thought that the conflict between the rich and the poor
threatened democracy. Aristotle thought that a strong middle class
was the best basis for politics. Both were right, and still are. In
today's United States, the widening wealth gap helps breed
survival-of-the-fittest attitudes and monied control of politics
which further undercut the middle class. The share of U.S. household
income going to the middle quintile of the population, for example,
has been falling for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Gore Vidal insists that the country is ruled by a single party
with two virtually indistinguishable factions, one called
"Democratic," the other "Republican." Do you agree? And, if so, what
danger does this pose for the political health of the republic?</TE>
<TE>   A: In different ways, the late George Wallace and Ralph Nader have
said much the same thing. My view is that there are real differences
between the parties, but the economic ones are not as sharp as they
should be because too many politicians, including too many liberals,
have to raise too much money from corporations and fat cats. On many
backstairs issues, big contributions call the shots, and what used to
be the Vital Center of American politics has become a Venal Center.</TE>

<DH>GOLDEN STATE, GOLDEN YOUTH: The California Image in Popular
Culture, 1955-1966,  By Kirse Granat May, University of North
Carolina Press: 256 pp., $18.95, paper * Kirse Granat May reveals how
California's youth culture was the work of media marketing
entrepreneurs driven by profits and fear of class and race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold Story of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"All good teenagers go to California," Brian Wilson once quipped,
"when they die." Wilson's remark, far edgier and more richly ironic
than any of the hit songs he wrote and sang for the Beach Boys, is
invoked by Kirse Granat May in "Golden State, Golden Youth," a study
that deconstructs the popular culture of postwar America and shows
exactly how the California dream and the cult of youth came to be
linked in powerful but also cynical and even ominous ways.</LD>
<LD>   May, a historian who lives in Boston, digs through the
accumulation of cliches and conventional wisdom about the California
youth culture, and reveals how the whole phenomenon can be seen as
the handiwork of media and marketing entrepreneurs, driven by the
profit motive and something much deeper and darker--the fear of
class, race and generational conflict.</LD>
<LD>   "Aware of the possibilities of television, music, and film to
create a model of the good society, popular culture focused on the
commercial possibilities of the baby boomers," writes May. "A new
definable teenage type was created, and it was an ideal of exclusion:
white, middle-class, mobile, carefree and conformist."</LD>
<TE>   May is willing to name names, and she assigns Walt Disney a
crucial role in the invention of the youth culture and the conscious
decision to plant it in the rich soil of California. The opening of
Disneyland in 1955 fixed California in the collective consciousness
of a whole generation--and, indeed, the whole world--as "the land of
America's destiny." Above all, Disney elevated the pursuit of
happiness from an aspiration into a commodity to be packaged and sold
to what May dubs "the child imagination market."</TE>
<TE>   "By creating a monument to the dreams of youth, Disney offered a
privileged model of life for mass consumption," she explains. "He
turned his corner of the California world into an international
symbol of 'the good life.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Golden State, Golden Youth" invites us to regard the debut of
Disneyland as the first of two defining moments for the baby-boom
generation, a dividing line between an open-eyed if sometimes grim
view of the world and a more comforting but also delusory one that
was sold to us along with movies and music, T-shirts and lunch boxes,
housing tracts and fast food.</TE>
<TE>   By way of example, May reminds us that "Blackboard Jungle" and
"Rebel Without a Cause," both released the same year in which
Disneyland opened for business, offered a dark and dire vision of
adolescence in America, but these movies did not depict the
experience of the boomers and did not address them as an audience; we
were still wearing our Davy Crockett coonskin caps and watching "The
Mickey Mouse Club." By the time the boomers were old enough to buy
their own records and tickets, we put former Mouseketeer Annette
Funicello's "Tall Paul" on the charts and lined up to see Sandra Dee
in "Gidget."</TE>
<TE>   At its highest and purest expression, the California youth culture
is captured in the iconic image of a buxom Funicello on an
idyllically empty beach, dressed in a one-piece swimsuit and holding
a surfboard--a promotional photo for "Muscle Beach Party," one of a
series of beach-party movies from American International Pictures.
The promise of freedom and pleasure, sexual and otherwise, is
unmistakable, especially for a generation of young men who had passed
into puberty watching her grow up on "The Mickey Mouse Club," but the
beach-blanket movies were ultimately as safe and sexless as a Disney
cartoon.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave the illusion of being daring, but there was a lot of
teasing with no real payoff," Sam Arkoff, co-founder of the company
that produced "Muscle Beach Party," once told a reporter. The
beach-party movies, he explains, depicted a teenage utopia in which
there were "no parents, no school, no church, no legal or government
authorities, no rich kids or poor kids, no money problems--none of
the things that plague the young people today."</TE>
<TE>   The same kind of deception and manipulation, as May shows, was
practiced in the music industry. Dennis Wilson was the only member of
the Beach Boys who actually surfed, but they elevated the surfing
subculture into a shiny new symbol of the California youth culture.
The Beach Boys may have lifted their guitar riffs, note for note,
from Chuck Berry but, no less than "The Mickey Mouse Club" and
"Gidget," they conjured up "a white, middle-class version of youth."</TE>
<TE>   "As the Beach Boys told Time," May writes, "'We're not colored;
we're white. And we sing white.'"</TE>
<TE>   The second defining moment, as May sees it, came nine years after
the opening of Disneyland: the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley,
which captured the attention of national media in 1964. The Free
Speech Movement can be seen as an example of how baby boomers
rejected the phoniness of the California youth culture that had been
peddled to them all of their lives. "The Berkeley conflict challenged
one of the most powerful and reassuring myths of the postwar period,
altering the images of California's young people that had pervaded
popular culture," writes May. "Berkeley came to represent 'the depths
of disaffection in Nirvana.'"</TE>
<TE>   But the California youth culture did not end with the coming of
the counterculture. Indeed, May shows how the phenomenon came full
circle, ironically enough, in the gubernatorial candidacy of Ronald
Reagan in 1966--the former actor who had hosted the live broadcast
from Disneyland on opening day in 1955 now played on the same old
Disneyesque themes in his own campaign, setting himself against the
"filthy speech movement" and embracing a safe and wholesome vision of
youth.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan, for example, was accompanied on campaign appearances by a
covey of "Reagan girls," a carefully orchestrated crowd of young
women who wore costumes designed by Nancy Reagan (the maximum waist
size was 25 inches) and whose presence was meant to cast the
reflected glow of golden youth on the visibly aging Reagan. An
instruction manual issued to the young women, as May reveals,
reminded them that they "'represent the young, wholesome, vivacious,
natural, all-American girl' and warned against smoking, chewing gum,
drinking alcohol or giving out phone numbers."</TE>
<TE>   "Golden State, Golden Youth," wholly fascinating in its savvy take
on the making and manipulation of popular culture, ends on an
admonitory note: "California represented a cautionary tale," writes
May, "instead of a fairy tale promise." The baby-boom generation is
still enchanted with itself, of course, still gripped by a sense of
entitlement and still at risk of sinking into mindless self-regard.
As May demonstrates so compellingly, that's exactly how we were
raised, from birth and far beyond.</TE>

<HD>Postmodern Zionism</HD>
<DH>ELVIS IN JERUSALEM: Post-Zionism and the Americanization of
Israel, By Tom Segev, Translated by Haim Watzman, Metropolitan Books:
168 pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER LAQUEUR</AU>
<BD>Walter Laqueur is the chairman of the Research Council
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, editor of the
Yale "Encyclopedia of the Holocaust," and the author of many books,
including "A History of Zionism" and "Generation Exodus: The Fate of
Young Jewish Refugees From Nazi Germany."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, Tom Segev has been writing a column in a leading Israeli
daily titled "Katav sar" which, literally translated, means "foreign
correspondent." But since Segev is not a foreign correspondent in his
homeland, it points to an element of detachment if not alienation, as
if he were seeing his country from the outside.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike some other critics, he is not predictable. He does not, for
instance, believe that Norman Finkelstein or even Hannah Arendt are
the highest authorities on the Holocaust. And this unconventional
viewpoint has given his columns an interest and freshness that other
critics don't have.</LD>
<LD>   In "Elvis in Jerusalem," he deals with certain cultural trends in
Israel over the last decade, and it appears at a time when these
issues are not exactly on the top of our agenda. But the comments of
a shrewd observer are still of interest, not only to professionals in
the field of cultural studies but to anyone interested in
understanding the continuing debates in Israel over its ideological
foundations.</LD>
<TE>   Americanization in Israel has expressed itself in a variety of
forms: culinary, linguistic, musical and so on. Its impact cannot
possibly be overlooked even by a casual visitor, but I do not think
it has gone further than what has taken place in other countries. If
the term "bye" has entered the Hebrew language, for instance, then
"design" and "date" (replacing "rendezvous") have become German,
"high life" and "parking" Russian, the French "ordinateur" fights an
uphill struggle against "computer," and there are a thousand other
examples. It is also true that, in some respects, Israeli mass
culture has moved beyond being Americanized, going for better or
worse its own ways.</TE>
<TE>   One of the byproducts of Americanization, Segev suggests, was the
appearance of post-Zionism, a small but articulate political-cultural
trend confined almost entirely to the universities. Post-Zionism was,
grosso modo, the Israeli equivalent of postmodernism and
post-colonial studies. (True, some post-Zionists were not
postmodernists, but this hardly affected the general picture.) It
challenged the founding myths of Zionism in a variety of fields:
history, archeology, sociology, even theology.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Zionist writings scandalized many the traditional Zionists,
who thought them sacrilegious. At one stage, Segev relates, the
Israeli parliament decided almost unanimously to have a history
textbook rewritten; admittedly it had gone a little far in the
direction of post-colonialism, featuring a picture of Gamal Abdel
Nasser but not of David Ben-Gurion.</TE>
<TE>   I found post-Zionism not particularly revolutionary but a little
provincial; it ignored the fact that the origins of all nations are
shrouded in mythology, that Israel has no monopoly in this respect.
(Even the term "post-Zionism" is not really new, it appears on the
first page of my "History of Zionism," written more than three
decades ago, and I was certainly not the first to use it.)</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Israeli school system had indoctrinated its children
too intensively; they had come to take the Bible as a guide to
history which, in the end, provoked a rebellion. Much has undermined
the myths: Revisionist archeologists have recently claimed that the
children of Israel were not in Egypt in the first place, that the
walls of Jericho did not crumble when Joshua sounded his trumpet, and
that King David's kingdom, if it existed, was not a mighty empire but
more a modest collection of villages in the Judean hills.</TE>
<TE>   As to the truth in these claims, the debate continues. But
whatever the outcome, the political-philosophical consequences are
not readily obvious. If the Israelites were not serfs in Egypt and
did not cross the Red Sea, they must have lived in Palestine all
along, and this does not weaken their claim to have had an ancient
link with the country. For those who did not pass through the Israeli
school system, the excitement of the post-Zionists about their
discoveries, their demystification and deconstruction is not easy to
understand. The same is true with regard to their shock and
indignation at having discovered that, in contrast to what the early
Zionist leaders argued, Palestine was not an empty country waiting
for the Jewish people to take possession. Few Zionist leaders did
claim this; only the blind could have made such claims. The truth was
more prosaic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1897, the year of the first Zionist Congress, the total
population of Palestine was about one quarter that of the city of
Vienna, in which Zionism's founder, Theodor Herzl, lived. In other
words, it was not exactly overpopulated. He might perhaps be forgiven
for believing that the presence of a few hundred thousand in
Palestine should not make it impossible to establish a Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Zionism appeared on the Israeli scene after the demise of the
old (Marxist) left; there was a vacuum which it tried to fill, but it
failed to do so for a variety of reasons. One reason was
predominantly linguistic: The language of postmodernism and
post-colonialism does not always travel well; translated into another
language it became even more obscure and limited its appeal to a few
cognoscenti.</TE>
<TE>   It was meant to reach, above all, the "oppressed minorities" such
as the "Mizrahim," Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin
which, given their values, mentality and political outlook, was a
hopeless enterprise. The last thing they wanted was a demystification
of their traditions, and their brotherly love for their Arab
neighbors was strictly limited.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the ideologues failed to understand that their total
critique nurtured in the safety and seclusion of American campuses
would not travel well to a small country in the Middle East whose
very survival was not assured. For these and other reasons,
post-Zionism remained a marginal phenomenon, and of late, even the
attacks against it have ceased.</TE>
<TE>   These are not, to put it mildly, happy days for the state of
Israel. The Israeli electorate in its wisdom has elected a government
that has led to the isolation and weakening of the country. This has
brought about the polarization of political attitudes; the right has
become more extreme and the left more confused. It is not a very
pleasant situation, and in many ways, one looks back longingly to the
days, not so long ago, when Segev's book was written and people had
the time and the inclination to engage in cultural and ideological
battles of the kind he vividly describes.</TE>
<TE>   "Elvis in Jerusalem" is, in many ways, an ideological guidebook to
the world of yesterday; perhaps this world will be resurrected one
day, but chances at the moment are not too good.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Elvis in Jerusalem'</TE>
<TE>   One day when I was a student at the Hebrew University High School
in Jerusalem, our literature teacher stormed into the room, beside
himself. The teacher, A.B. Yehoshua, now a leading Israeli novelist,
would often share his most deeply felt thoughts with us, and an
experience he'd had the previous evening had roiled him badly. While
walking down Hakeren Hakayemet Street in the Rehavia neighborhood,
not far from the Hebrew Gymnasium, another high school, he had
noticed a group of teenagers having a loud discussion under a
streetlight. He was elated--he loved impassioned young people. But
when he came closer and heard what they were talking about, he was
terribly disappointed. They weren't debating Zionist values. The
subject being discussed so fiercely was the cost of a Volkswagen
Beetle in Germany.</TE>

<HD>A Room of One's Own</HD>
<DH>CAMILLE CLAUDEL: A Life, By Odile Ayral-Clause, Harry N.
Abrams: 280 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA MacADAM</AU>
<BD>Barbara MacAdam is a senior editor at ARTnews.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the public imagination, Camille Claudel (1864-1943) is remembered
mostly as Auguste Rodin's lover--the one whose ideas Rodin may have
stolen or the one who stole his, the one whose career and life were
ruined by their torrid affair. Heartbroken at failing to break up
Rodin's relationship with his longtime companion Rose Beuret, Claudel
stopped sculpting and succumbed to bouts of irrationality and
paranoia. Her embarrassed family had her committed to asylums, where
she remained the last 30 years of her life.</LD>
<LD>   This is the subject that has most fascinated Claudel's previous
biographers and exemplifies how a life and career can become obscured
in the effort to devise a simple, coherent narrative, highlighted by
popular romance and social and political agendas. And while Odile
Ayral-Clause's new biography, "Camille Claudel: A Life," may not be
groundbreaking, it is, mercifully, myth-dispelling. By excavating
Claudel from the edifice of victimization, Ayral-Clause frees us to
focus on her work and the factors, both Rodin- and non-Rodin-related,
that nurtured and hindered her career.</LD>
<TE>   Claudel was a beautiful and intense young woman. Certainly she
suffered the constraints of the period's conservative attitudes
toward women and of a mother who subscribed to the provincial values
of the day: Her mother was scandalized by her daughter's desire to
sculpt nudes and was so cold that Claudel's brother, Paul, would
write, "Our mother never kissed us."</TE>
<TE>   But while Claudel's mother was discomfited by her daughter's
bohemian lifestyle, Claudel's father fully supported her career, even
pushed her to assert her independence, which Ayral-Clause observes in
a measured and nuanced way. She acknowledges how Rodin, dominant by
virtue of his fame, his age (he was 24 years older than she), his
role as teacher and her role as assistant, was also a staunch
supporter, arranging for exhibitions and reviews and even helping
financially. After her death, he established a room for her work in
the Musee Rodin in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The moment seems right for a surge of interest in Claudel, whose
artistic achievements were largely neglected during her lifetime. In
an art environment as eclectic as today's, the past can look fresher
than it did in its own time. Ironically, Claudel's work can seem more
modern than Rodin's, owing to its rawness, angst and vulnerability.
Where his works are characteristically balanced, composed and smooth,
hers can be angular and marked by violent plays of light and shadow.
Her strongest sculptures are her portrait busts, which seem to owe
little to Rodin and much to the personalities of their subjects.
Rodin called her 1892 bust of him "the finest sculptured head since
Donatello."</TE>
<TE>   A professor of French and the humanities at Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, Ayral-Clause has drawn from abundant unpublished materials,
including photographs, letters and medical records, along with the
diaries and journals of Claudel's brother, the playwright and poet
Paul Claudel (1868-1955). She offers considerable information,
sufficient to stand as an armature for more expansive studies. In
fact, with its plain, sometimes almost naive language, the book
serves best as an introduction to the subject. What is missing is a
more vivid picture of Claudel's intellectual milieu, her interactions
with other contemporary artists and writers and a more in-depth
consideration of her relationship with Paul and how his notoriety and
ideas affected her work.</TE>
<TE>   Claudel's artistic inclination was apparent before she was 12. In
school, she became noted for her drawings, mostly portraits. But she
was also interested in sculpting, inspired by the red clay and the
gnarly rock formations near her grandparents' home in Villeneuve sur
Fere. Noticing her talent, the sculptor Alfred Boucher offered to
assist her, and finally, along with her tutor, recommended that she
and Paul study in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1881, and Claudel was 17. The family got an apartment in
Montparnasse, and she enrolled at l'Academie Colarossi. Artists were
everywhere in Paris, and Ayral-Clause paints a smart, occasionally
cliched picture of the atmosphere. Women could not enter the Ecole
des Beaux-Arts, but they could study at the all-female atelier of
Charles Chaplin, or at Julian's, which offered women access to nude
models and visits by prominent artists. Exclusion from depicting
nudes had denied women access both to the mainstream and to
commissions. Claudel shared a studio with two British women and
Boucher visited regularly, giving them free advice. He introduced
Claudel to his friend Paul Dubois, director of the Ecole des
Beaux-Arts, and she studied with him for a year. She then studied
under Rodin for two years and proved to be especially adept at
modeling hands and feet, which Rodin later had her do in his
"Burghers of Calais." Claudel entered Rodin's studio as an assistant
in 1884, when he was sculpting "The Gates of Hell." They quickly
developed an intense artistic and romantic relationship that was to
continue for 15 years. Ayral-Clause points out that "much has been
made of Rodin's 'exploitation' of Camille's work because ... when she
became his assistant, he finished and signed a number of her
sculptures." The truth is, it was often hard to determine authorship
since it was the nature of the studio system for all works to
essentially belong to the teacher. But just as Claudel had responded
to the strength of Rodin's work, it is apparent that he was
influenced by some of her softer, more expressive figures.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1890s, Claudel was gaining her own voice, even as her
relationship with Rodin began to deteriorate. (It ended in 1898.) She
produced her famous "Clotho" (1893), a figure her friend Claude
Debussy considered fearsome. In mythology, Clotho was one of three
sisters who wove the fate of man. Claudel represented her as an old
woman caught in the threads of her manipulative weavings. For writer
Octave Mirbeau, it was a vision of death with "nimble and nervous
legs whose strides cut human lives, she laughs in her death mask."
She looks like a figure out of the Baroque, and like a lacy rock in
art nouveau guise, a grotesque inversion of the "Winged Victory of
Samothrace."</TE>
<TE>   And though Claudel continued to produce such potent works as "La
Valse" (1892) and "L'Age Mur" (the first version of which she
produced in 1895), "Les Causeuses" (1897), and "La Vague" (1900), the
latter two showing the influence of japonisme and art nouveau, she
was also growing increasingly paranoid. Rodin had promised at one
point that after six months he would leave Beuret and marry Claudel,
but he never did.</TE>
<TE>   Claudel expressed her anguish in "L'Age Mur" (The Age of
Maturity). The sculpture portrays a middle-aged man moving toward an
elderly woman and turning from a beautiful young one. People
immediately recognized that Rodin was the subject. He became
infuriated and tried to prevent it from being shown. This only fueled
her paranoia as she accused Rodin of interfering with her career and
stealing her ideas.</TE>
<TE>   In 1907, Claudel began destroying her work with a hammer. Her
paranoia was such that when the French bureaucracy did not pay her
promptly for the bronze version of her "Niobide blessee" (1907) she
launched into a tirade, blaming Rodin first, and then attacking the
art inspector for the Ministry of Culture Eugene Morand "with such
vulgar postcards, and with envelopes containing such foul-smelling
filth, that I want to have nothing to do with Mlle. Claudel." The
filth was cat feces.</TE>
<TE>   Ayral-Clause describes how only days after Claudel's father died,
her mother and brother committed her. She spent much of her time in
complete isolation, cut off from her family, though Paul saw her
twice. She had abandoned her art, did some gardening and was allowed
few visitors and often no mail so as not to excite her.</TE>
<TE>   As a poignant summary, Ayral-Clause quotes Louis Vauxelles on the
occasion of a 1934 Claudel retrospective at the Salon des Femmes
Artistes Modernes, recalling the words of art dealer and Claudel
defender Eugene Blot: Claudel "was to Rodin what [Berthe] Morisot was
to Manet. Each one working next to a crushing master, keeps her own
personality ....this rustic woman from Lorraine, hard, willful,
untamable, remained herself."</TE>

<HD>The Poetry of Engagement</HD>
<DH>FINDERS KEEPERS: Selected Prose, 1971-2001, By Seamus
Heaney, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 432 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN PALATTELLA</AU>
<BD>John Palattella writes about poetry for the London
Review of Books, the Nation and Dissent.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Very late in his life, W.B. Yeats imagined himself in the Municipal
Gallery of Dublin among paintings honoring the heroes of recent Irish
history. "Around me the images of thirty years," the poet writes in
"The Municipal Gallery Revisited," and after lingering among the
portraits and the memories they evoke, he concludes, "Think where
man's glory most begins and ends/And say my glory was I had such
friends."</LD>
<LD>   In a discussion of these lines in his 1995 Nobel lecture, Seamus
Heaney contends that, despite being expansive and thrilling, "they
are an instance of poetry flourishing itself rather than proving
itself," and of a poet who, captivated by the cut of his singing
robes, ignores the circumstances that pricked him into song. In
"Finders Keepers," Heaney has gathered some of the best prose he has
written during the last 30 years, and the pieces are vivacious
portraits of poets who have mostly avoided Yeats' indulgence.</LD>
<LD>   Heaney's central preoccupation is with the truth-telling capacity
of poetry, or a poet's ability to grapple with social reality without
feeling vindictive or overly triumphant about his or her art.
Although catastrophes such as the Holocaust, Heaney writes, have led
people to wonder "if it is a delusion and a danger to expect poetry
and music to do too much, it is a diminishment of them and a
derogation to ignore what they can do."</LD>
<TE>   In the work of the poets he highly prizes--Zbigniew Herbert, W.H.
Auden, Paul Muldoon, Czeslaw Milosz and even Yeats, in his unhaughty
moments--Heaney detects a fluent, unresolved dialectic between lyric
as pure lyric and lyric as moral conscience, between a language of
expressionist exuberance and one of reasonable engagement.</TE>
<TE>   What's reasonable? As Heaney explains in "The Redress of Poetry,"
poetry "does not intervene in the actual, but by offering
consciousness a chance to recognize its predicaments, foreknow its
capacities, and rehearse its comebacks in all kinds of venturesome
ways, it does constitute a beneficent event."</TE>
<TE>   Heaney also devotes a corner of his gallery to untrammeled
romantics such as John Clare and Osip Mandelstam, whose lyrical raids
on the word-horde were acts of defiance against a forced social or
political role. Verbs that appear frequently in these pages are
"outstrip" and "outface," and whether Heaney uses them to describe
Irish poets of his own generation or Mandelstam's impudent notes on
Dante's "Inferno" (which he wrote in the early 1930s before being
packed off to the gulag for attacking Stalin in a poem), they refer
to the complex act of a poet telling hard social truths without
allowing them to harden his or her mind or art.</TE>
<TE>   An Irish Catholic raised in Northern Ireland and living in Ulster
when the Troubles erupted, Heaney is equally preoccupied with the
intricacies of culture. He writes often about the indigenous but
stresses that it rarely springs from bucolic turf. In "Mossbawm," he
recalls bathing in a moss hole as a child, "treading the liver-thick
mud, unsettling a smoky muck off the bottom and coming out smeared
and weedy and darkened." The episode was not a baptism into
territorial piety, however. In "Feeling Into Words," Heaney
chronicles how he came to believe in the confluence between poetic
memory and the Irish bog- land, which archeological excavations in
the late 1960s had revealed to be the preserve of ancient treasures
and horrors.</TE>
<TE>   Among the artifacts extracted from the murky waste were not only
glistening slabs of white butter and the skeleton of a great Irish
elk but also the remains of several Europeans ritually slaughtered
during the Iron Age, whom Heaney views as the ancestors of civilians
murdered during the Troubles. What's salubrious about "Finders
Keepers" is how Heaney manages to fathom such cultural fissions and
fusions without resorting to the cant of postmodernism.</TE>
<TE>   In Heaney's lexicon, a poem is a piece of art, not a textual
operation, and culture, no matter how murderous or divisive its
history, can still bear value.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few lulls in "Finders Keepers," and they occur when
Heaney travels beyond Europe's western border. There are essays on
Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop and Sylvia Plath, whom Heaney likes
mostly because they have achieved a particular style. The essays are
as stylish and intelligent as any in the book, but they don't deliver
provocative insights about the poets. They are best read as
barometers of Heaney's formal preoccupations.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, considering Heaney's fascination with the subcultural
life of indigenous speech and how it might irrigate national
identity, one wonders what Heaney would say about the lyrics of W.C.
Williams, Allen Ginsberg or Susan Howe, all of whom satisfy Heaney's
requirement that poetry "be antic, mettlesome, contrary, [retaining]
the right to impudence." Still, what one admires in much of "Finders
Keepers" is the same tenacious curiosity that Heaney admires in the
poetry of Herbert: the desire "to discover whether the inner citadel
of a human being is a selfish bolt-hole or an attentive
listening-post."</TE>

<DH>AIN'T NO TOMORROW: Kobe, Shaq, and the Making of a Lakers
Dynasty, By Elizabeth Kaye, Contemporary Books: 230 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL PLASCHKE</AU>
<BD>Bill Plaschke is a Times sports columnist. He is the
author of "Hard Knox: The Life of an NFL Coach" with Chuck Knox and
"No More Mr. Nice Guy: A Life of Hardball" with Dick Williams.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA playoffs this spring has
been like watching that nutty couple from next door walking
arm-in-arm down your street. There was a time when all you heard
coming from their window was the sound of flying pots and flailing
invectives. Now all you see is love. You want to applaud them, you
want to embrace them, but, mostly, you want to ask them: So what
happened?</LD>
<LD>   In "Ain't No Tomorrow: Kobe, Shaq, and the Making of a Lakers
Dynasty," Elizabeth Kaye answers that question the way the nosy
organizer of the annual block party might. There's some juicy new
dish; there're some unexplained rumors; mostly, though, there's a
harmless recounting of the war, the truce and the 2001 Laker
championship forged by a cocky David--Kobe Bryant--and an anxious
Goliath--Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   Kaye, a respected freelancer who spent quality time with the team,
attempts to make sense of it all with a final note about the logo
painted on the floor of the team's practice facility. Instead of
neatly spelling HEALTHSOUTH--the name sponsor of the building--the
letters were irregularly arranged around center court as
"HEALTHSOUTH."</LD>
<TE>   "Seen from a distance, for a moment these letters appeared to
spell out the legend HEAL THYSELF," Kaye writes, in conclusion.
"That's not what they said. But it's what happened."</TE>
<TE>   It is a wonderful observation that applies to the current Lakers,
a team that is difficult to read and impossible to understand. Kaye
makes a good effort, but the problem with "Ain't No Tomorrow" is a
problem related to the peculiar position the Lakers occupy in a city
and a society defined by the Hollywood entertainment machine.</TE>
<TE>   No longer just basketball players, Bryant, O'Neal and the gang are
movie stars with million-dollar contracts guaranteed far beyond the
life of an average flick. They don't need Kaye. They don't need the
media. They don't even need their fans. They have no reason,
financial or otherwise, to offer the public any sort of peek into
their souls.</TE>
<TE>   So, unlike the Showtime Lakers of two decades ago and in spite of
the best efforts of writers such as Kaye, the Lakers of today remain
elusive and enigmatic. We don't know them, and we never will.</TE>
<TE>   Kaye clearly worked hard and scratches the surface here with some
interesting information that paints both sides of a feud that will
remain with the Lakers as long as Bryant and O'Neal are each wearing
a uniform. In fact, it is their competing personalities that lie at
the heart of each Laker success and disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Some would say it was O'Neal's fault. Kaye writes about the team
bus passing a huge billboard featuring Bryant, at which point many on
the bus glanced back at O'Neal because they knew he was jealous and
his jealousy often got in the way of his game. She also writes about
the time coach Phil Jackson called out O'Neal in the locker room for
partying too hard, one of the best fresh stories here.</TE>
<TE>   Others would say it was Bryant's fault. She writes about guard Ron
Harper challenging Bryant to a fight if he did not pass the ball. She
recounts that poignant moment when Bryant apologized to the team for
taking too many shots. There is also a compelling scene when Jackson
stopped a team bus and canceled practice because of Bryant's repeated
insistence on hogging the ball during a recent game.</TE>
<TE>   Kaye describes both players stooping to the level of whining
children, which is nothing we didn't already suspect. The real
problem is she doesn't tell us how they came to behave like men. The
guess is she wasn't able to uncover that information.</TE>
<TE>   She did much better with Jackson, taking us into his home and into
his head, allowing, for example, us to witness Jackson's apology to
Bryant for that now-famous interview in which he claimed that Bryant
would sabotage his high school games so he could be the hero in the
final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But we never learn how Bryant felt about the apology, only that he
nodded. In another instance, she writes about the rumor that O'Neal
used hand signs to order teammates to keep the ball away from Bryant,
but she never tells us if the story was true.</TE>
<TE>   For a book that is episodically told, these stories read like non
sequiturs, portions of which we know. In a notable exception, Kaye
recounts Bryant's late-season dinner last year with Jerry West, the
moment when Bryant finally realized that the Lakers could win only if
he became a team player.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hate you, too, if I was your teammate," West reportedly told
him. Though the dinner was public knowledge, that quote is new. If
only the book contained more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   While Kaye clearly worked overtime on this book, the Lakers in the
end proved as difficult to examine as they are to score upon. But
parts of the book are great fun. One of my favorite anecdotes--one of
Kaye's three-point baskets--describes the time the rascal Isaiah
Rider missed the Laker bus to the last game of the NBA finals in
Philadelphia last year. While providing light, easy-chair
accompaniment during the commercials in this spring's playoffs,
"Ain't No Tomorrow" somehow misses that same championship bus.</TE>

<LD>ACROSS OPEN GROUND</LD>
<LD>   By Heather Parkinson</LD>
<LD>   Bloomsbury: 248 pp., $23.95</LD>
<TE>   When you read a beautifully written love story, love awakens
wherever it has been sleeping in you. Not a simpering sentimental
story, not a sex manual, but a story that conveys the balance of pain
and sweetness that love is. You lean into stories like these, turning
the pages quickly to get to the parts where the lovers finally enter
their own world and leave the world of suffering outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Across Open Ground" is such a story. It is set in Idaho in 1917.
The characters are sheepherders and women who depend on the kindness
of strangers. The landscape includes forked lightning, gullies and
other natural and man-made hurdles. There is the rumble of world war
and a lame red horse that must be shot.</TE>
<TE>   Walter is a fine young man (perhaps in his early 20s) who doesn't
understand the heat that sweeps over him when he meets Trina. It
takes a long time to get to their shivering kisses. We live through a
lot of weather and hard work and misunderstandings and dreams to get
there.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Parkinson's writing is strangely awkward at times; the
sentence structure can seem strangled. But sometimes the awkwardness
is like the fumbling that comes before grace, a stop on the learning
curve, a point on the arc between humans and God.</TE>

<TE>   CLIMBING FREE</TE>
<TE>   My Life in the Vertical World</TE>
<TE>   By Lynn Hill with Greg Child</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton: 288 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   It can't hurt that Lynn Hill is stunningly beautiful (which
doesn't affect her climbing but does enhance her celebrity status),
this 5-foot-tall phenom who began climbing at 14 and kept doing it
until she had won a World Cup and made the first free ascent of El
Capitan's notorious Nose route in one day (much of it in the dark).
"Climbing Free" is one of those portraits of the good side of
obsession: the side that leads to success and proficiency. But along
the way, Hill loses many friends, particularly to high-altitude
mountaineering. She decides early in her climbing life that what she
loves is the feel of rocks, preferably without too many ropes and
tools. She ascends above the machismo of the sport: "Everyone was
equal before the rocks, it seemed to me. The beauty of climbing is
that each person is free to choreograph his or her own way of
adapting to the rock."</TE>
<TE>   Hill was born in 1961 in Michigan in a family of seven kids whose
father left on Christmas in 1976. She discovered her love for
climbing, like so many, in California at Joshua Tree and then
Yosemite. The book is also a history of the sport, of the groups and
ideas and evolution of climbing, from the Stonemasters, a group of
California climbers in the 1970s, to the Camp Four Yosemite climbers
in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   These were the kids from all walks of life who lived to climb,
redeeming soda cans and selling marijuana to live as close to El
Capitan as they could get. Hill's personal life is as chaotic as her
climbing life is focused. She wins competition after competition and
travels around the world-climbing in Vietnam and Tasmania and Europe.
"It was clear to me," she writes, "that the further I went toward the
'extreme,' the further I was from achieving a harmonious balance in
my life."</TE>
<TE>   "Climbing Free" marks the point of change. "No matter where I am
in the world or what summit I've attained, the greatest sense of
fulfillment in my life is connected to people." The book's
photographs of grinning friends on various peaks are a testament to
that.</TE>

<TE>   DIRT UNDER MY NAILS</TE>
<TE>   An American Farmer</TE>
<TE>   and Her Changing Land</TE>
<TE>   By Marilee Foster</TE>
<TE>   Bridge Works: 176 pp., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Marilee Foster farms 600 acres of family land in Sagaponak, N.Y.,
one of the most beautiful places on eastern Long Island, the most
fertile and the most threatened to become "Hamptonized,"
overdeveloped and crowded.</TE>
<TE>   Foster's claim to and love for this part of the world goes back
four generations to her great great-grandfather, a whaling captain in
the 1880s who purchased the land. She and her brother plant potatoes
and various farm-stand vegetables. She is only vaguely tolerant of
summer people who fall in love with the Atlantic Coast, and more than
a little gleeful, it seems to me, when their enormous houses are
pulled out to sea in winter storms. There's nothing a farmer likes to
see punished more than hubris.</TE>
<TE>   Foster writes simply and specifically about the birds and seasons;
you can smell the new asparagus and the strawberries. But she is also
eloquent on the subject of weeds and ants and burrs and buying farm
equipment from the Amish in Pennsylvania. She's no romantic. "Dirt
Under My Nails" gives the pleasant feeling of reading a local column
or that testament to practical literature, "The Farmer's Almanac."</TE>

<DH>SPLENDIDE CALIFORNIE!: Impressions of the Golden State by
French Artists, 1786 to 1900, By Claudine Chalmers The Book Club of
California: 146 pp., $160</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>Thomas Sanchez is the author of two California novels,
"Rabbit Boss" and "Zoot-Suit Murders," and the novels "Mile Zero" and
"Day of the Bees."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Splendide Californie!" Splendid California indeed.</LD>
<LD>   With this simple exhortation, Claudine Chalmers has crafted a work
that transcends its original premise: the impressions of California
by French artists from 1786 to 1900. This is not simply an account of
the earliest French explorers to Spanish California, and the Gallic
parade that followed through the serene, then shifting and ultimately
tumultuous landscape of California in the 1800s.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, there is a stunning balance among paintings, woodcuts,
lithographs and sketches of an exquisite nature paired with judicious
and juicy anecdotal accounts of those who created them. There is no
Francophile pretense here, only the flesh and bone of those French
people who made their way to the island of gold, the western
Valhalla, seeking to get rich quick, to sketch an immortal moment in
art or to roam free in a new world of infinite possibilities; all is
rendered real. The drama of what the French encountered is captured,
from elegant Californio dons mounted on magnificent silver-saddled
steeds, to Mission scenes portraying the stripped-down military
occupation that they actually were, to young Frenchmen spending the
better half of a year on ships sailing to El Dorado, only to then
journey for months into wilderness, where many died of hunger,
disease, snakebite or the hostile arrows of the local inhabitants.</LD>
<TE>   There are vainglorious ambitions here: making enough of a kill in
the gold fields to buy this New World, three-quarters the size of
France itself, or setting up a new Napoleonic empire, or carving out
kingdoms of opulence such as the Old World had never dreamed. But
there are also the gold nuggets of ordinary people in extraordinary
times, artistic interpreters flush with the discovery of fresh
landscape as yet unpolished by the eyes of the masses, beckoning to
be revealed in paint, pen, pencil and charcoal, transformed to art.</TE>
<TE>   What spirals out from the center of this enterprise is the sense
of the vast canvas of early California, and the overriding confluence
of cultures and races that spilled across that canvas, anticipating
the California now inherited: freeways, smog, urbanization and
diminution of natural space. But for a moment, while turning the
pages of this book and traversing the visuals and stories of
California's lost world, the dream of the possible exists, history is
glimpsed, grandness is embraced, and the mundane celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   One wants to linger over all of the narrative illustrations: the
swiftly executed watercolor of a Monarch butterfly; the minimal but
dense sensibility of an 1851 watercolor of a brick-facade San
Francisco cityscape that Edward Hopper surely must have studied; the
hallucinogenic and giddy tilt of an 1865 lithograph of San Francisco
after a big shake, titled "Earth Quakey Times"; or the
light-up-the-night sky 1880 lithograph of "A Holiday in Chinatown";
or the spooky and mythological redolent 1881 scene in towering
redwoods aptly tagged "The Cremation of Care."</TE>
<TE>   So many jewels here, displayed with adroit panache in a book
handsomely crafted by California's Yolla Bolly Press. The book
itself, which was recently awarded a silver medal by the Commonwealth
Club of California for notable contribution to publishing, is a work
of art, rare and expensive, with a limited-edition printing of 450
copies. The most a reader can hope to do is visit this beauty of a
creation at one of the few libraries prescient enough to have secured
a copy for posterity. Another reasonably priced edition should be
published so that adventurous explorers of California art and history
can roar down the breathtaking visual and textual river that this
book offers.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, is left the reverberating memory of images
both intimate and monumental, the lavender light-infused sweep of
Santa Monica Beach in all its early holiday glory, the haughty peak
of Mt. Tamalpias before it was chained by suburbia.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the revelation of Pauline Aimee Schoenmakers.
Schoenmakers created more than 100 artworks in California between
1889 and 1899, while she was mostly in her 20s. When she had her
first child, she laid down her paintbrush; her life as a painter came
to an abrupt stop.</TE>
<TE>   Of her works, the one that particularly inspires is "Chinese Woman
Sitting in Chair," the portrait of a young Chinese woman reading from
an open book. It is a vision of contemplative beauty and
intelligence, infused with subdued mystery, like California herself
in one of her many guises, simply transporting.</TE>

<DH>SONS OF HEAVEN: A Novel, By Terrence Cheng, William Morrow:
310 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN SCHRANK</AU>
<BD>Ben Schrank is the author of the novels "Miracle Man"
and "Consent."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember the photograph of one man standing in front of a column of
tanks during the political uprising in Tiananmen Square in 1989? The
picture is not unlike Eddie Adams' famous 1968 photo of a South
Vietnamese officer shooting a man in the head or any of a great
number of photos that win Pulitzer Prizes because they can reduce
massive political struggles to a single moment and an all-too-human
scale.</LD>
<LD>   Novels don't do the same thing. They poke around for answers,
often find nothing and are often most successful when they linger,
when they give birth to a sense of doubt. Novels are not immediate.
But like Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs, they can embellish big
historical events with little human emotions. A good novel might try
to explain just what that man in Tiananmen Square was thinking.</LD>
<LD>   "Sons of Heaven" is a first novel about three Chinese men. One of
them, Xiao-Di, stood in front of that tank, while his brother Lu is a
common soldier, an enemy of such a dissident. The third is Deng
Xiaoping, who ordered the tank into the square. Terrence Cheng's
three men are more than simple characters (each with his own chapter)
in a novel. They signify the major political forces at play in modern
China.</LD>
<TE>   Cheng sets himself up for a high-wire act. Can "Sons of Heaven"
break out of the genre of the political novel? Can Xiao-Di, Lu and
Deng breathe and live as men, with such a huge burden of
representation on them? It's an arduous battle, set mostly in
Beijing, though with excursions into China's countryside, to the
Great Wall and even to Ithaca, N.Y. Cheng uses a large field to give
his novel historical scope.</TE>
<TE>   Xiao-Di is raised with his older brother by his grandparents. He
is destined to live a peasant's life in Beijing. But then he meets
Xiao-An, an unattractive young woman from a prosperous Party family.
Her family arranges to send him to Cornell University, where he is
somewhat politicized (more, sexualized) by a young woman named Elsie.
She calls people who are not white "colored" and, upon graduation,
immediately goes to work in the movie industry.</TE>
<TE>   Crushed by the loss of Elsie, Xiao-Di returns to Beijing with a
math degree and refuses to marry Xiao-An. Her family attempts to
destroy him; even his poor grandparents are furious with him. He
falls in with a friend called Wong, an embittered university student
who involves him with the protests at Tiananmen. The travels and
education that make up his fractured life feel like a recipe for
protest. If anyone might find himself standing in front of a column
of tanks, it's him.</TE>
<TE>   Xiao-Di's older brother Lu stands in stark contrast. Lu has always
been a soldier. He hasn't risen in the ranks because of his horrible
temper, and he believes in fighting. He hurt his leg as a child, and
his face has been disfigured. Unattractive, unthinking and prone to
violence, he is meant to embody all that is wrong with China's old
guard.</TE>
<TE>   Comrade Deng's chapters are woven into the narrative less
frequently. Deng ruminates about Mao and history. He dreams in great,
significant detail. But it's difficult to take the dream events too
seriously (in one, Deng cries in front of Mao, while in another he
kneels in a cave with Xiao-Di).</TE>
<TE>   Really, do men such as Deng sit back in their screening rooms, nap
and dream of dissidents? Luckily these dreams are short, and other
chapters employ far more action than farfetched political exegesis.
There's also plenty of violence. Lu not only believes that political
power grows out of the barrel of a gun. He uses the butt, too.</TE>
<TE>   The writing here is terse and often beautiful. It improves as the
violence increases, so when a house burns unjustly: "He listened now
to the crackle and blaze as the small house crumbled and cut itself
in half."</TE>
<TE>   There is not so much detail attached to the street life of
Beijing. There's little here about Tiananmen Square save for the
banners ("Newspapers Should Speak the Truth") and the white plaster
statue of the Goddess of Democracy that the students erect across the
square from the portrait of Mao.</TE>
<TE>   Cheng's concise style works better with people. He wonderfully
describes the brothers' blinded, furious grandfather, drunk and
raving in a miserable house in a hutong, a Beijing neighborhood slum
with a stinking communal bathroom. And in the sparse details of the
skirmishes around the square, the terror of being a dissident in
Beijing comes through.</TE>
<TE>   There's a not-unwelcome action-movie feel to "Sons of Heaven." The
two brothers are such opposites, and waiting for their meeting is
like waiting for the clash between two mortal enemies in a war movie.
Meanwhile, Deng paces his living quarters, thinking about his place
in history. And this, too, is cinematic. But there's an epic sweep
here as well, and the dissident's cries feel real.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the novel stays within the confines of its genre. But
what's wrong with that? There's no reason that these characters
should transcend politics when politics is crushing them. The novel
closes in on itself in a way that's similar to the real-world
conclusion to the tragedy at Tiananmen Square.</TE>
<TE>   And given today's political clashes and their hopeless outcomes,
the political novel genre may deserve to be revived. If we accept
that sometimes politics is all we are, than this clash between
polemic-heavy brothers glows with truth.</TE>

<DH>STARDUST MELODY : The Life and Music of Hoagy Carmichael,
By Richard M. Sudhalter, Oxford University Press: 432 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID THOMSON</AU>
<BD>David Thomson is the author of "The New Biographical
Dictionary of Film." A fourth, fully revised, edition will be
published this fall.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard M. Sudhalter begins this invaluable book with the memory of
meeting two college juniors, female and blond, on a United flight.
You see, these kids don't know who Hoagy Carmichael (1899-1981) was,
even though Sudhalter has just told them that work on Carmichael is
dominating his life.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't matter what Sudhalter looks like; just evoking
Carmichael's name--for those who knew who he was--summons up the lazy
stare, the bravura deadpan teasing, the looking the girls over. It's
the way he eyes Lauren Bacall in "To Have and Have Not" after she's
asked him about the song he's playing, and he comes back with: "Did
you say something?" Bacall, 19, tawny and untamed. And Carmichael
sitting at that upright, playing a guy named Cricket, with a match in
his mouth, 45 or so, and catnip all the way home. No wonder Humphrey
Bogart worried once he saw how seriously this novice was approaching
the movie without ever losing his sultry cool: "Did you say
something?" he asks, instead of signing away his soul, his songs and
the mineral rights of Indiana just to look at her.</LD>
<TE>   What I mean is, if you "get" Carmichael, it doesn't matter if you
don't know all the wistful, dreamy songs, "Star Dust," "Skylark,"
"One Morning in May," "Rockin' Chair" and "Lazybones." If you take
one look at his sly act--sitting at a piano in the corner of life's
cafe-cabaret, cool, collected and canny if talked to, picking out
some back-country tune that keeps slipping closer to jazz--then
you're hooked. That Hoagy Carmichael is an icon of style, not just a
provider of music, but somewhere between Feste and the Fool, a
sublime, benign attendant to the action. Indeed, after "To Have and
Have Not," "The Best Years of Our Lives" or "Young Man With a Horn,"
how did anyone ever make a movie again without Carmichael at a piano
straddling that soft line where the light meets the shadows?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he was a songwriter too, with an ease, a completeness and a
presence that just about every songwriter since has envied. Don't
think I'm putting him down in ranking the songwriting second, and I
haven't even mentioned the best song yet. But try forgetting that
lean, taut face, the horny eyes, the suave, rustic voice and the
absolute aplomb of just being there, doodling, noodling, coaxing some
shy cat of melody out of the keys. But for Carmichael, we might not
have the classic Sinatra pose of the '50s, the one more for the road.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there are United flights flying the friendly skies,
loaded with kids who don't know the song titles and who can barely
summon up the memory of their mother humming "Two Sleepy People" or
some similar tune, some moment after their parents made love. All the
more reason to appreciate Sudhalter's "Stardust Melody."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, there has been no objective book on Carmichael
before. Carmichael himself published two memoirs, "The Stardust Road"
(1946) and "Sometimes I Wonder" (1965), but Sudhalter is a dedicated
researcher who has to admit that his hero sometimes made a few things
up, tricked cold facts into a wry story and generally saw himself in
a smoky light akin to that of movies. He was a character.</TE>
<TE>   Sudhalter doesn't let the gaps and cracks of history spoil his
fondness. That's fair enough, even if it leads to one serious
shortcoming that I'll address. But as an author, he is also a
musician (a trumpet player) and the coauthor of a biography of Bix
Beiderbecke. Though he stresses this point a few times too many,
Sudhalter is very good on the impact of the early friendship between
Bix and Hoagy (cut short by Bix's death in 1931) and, above all, on
the inspiration left by the ill-fated crystal cornet player whose
melodic and harmonic inventions were as startling as Louis
Armstrong's but who lacked the vitality or the racial need to be the
great jazz trumpeter of that day.</TE>
<TE>   Sudhalter's credentials mean that the tracking of Carmichael's
songwriting is in reliable hands. Still, Carmichael was not just a
songwriter, but also an actor or storyteller in his great songs. He
was candid about his own vocal limits (but sure of their charm). He
sometimes elected to speak the lyrics as much as sing them. And in
his most characteristic work, we feel we are listening to a yarn. For
that reason alone, Sudhalter's strictly musical exegeses can be a
little chilly or off-putting. For instance, I can think of warmer
ways of elaborating on "Georgia on My Mind" than this:</TE>
<TE>   "The melody, as with all else Carmichael has written to date,
spills off the page like a hot chorus--a Bix chorus. Not only is the
'correlated' phrasing of the first eight bars readily apparent, but
the half-step downward shift from tonic to E7 in bar 5 is a
particularly subtle move."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, writing about music for the untrained is hard, and
Sudhalter has every reason to quote so much musical notation. Still,
while something of the innate Carmichael is missing, most keen
readers may do as I did: read with Carmichael music playing at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   Sudhalter is far more successful at tracing Carmichael's role as
lyricist. By habit, Carmichael employed lyric writers, usually of a
very high order. Yet he was plainly a laconic guy who loved and felt
words deeply. By careful examination of composition notes, Sudhalter
has discovered how regularly Carmichael nagged away at his lyricists
and got his own stuff into the songs. Nowhere is that truer than with
"I Get Along Without You Very Well" (1939), a song on which
Carmichael is the credited lyricist, though he acknowledged his debt
to a poem found in an old magazine. The last lines of that song, with
poise shuddering at its own wound, make one of the most piercing
moments in popular song:</TE>
<TE>   I get along without you very well,</TE>
<TE>   Of course I do.</TE>
<TE>   Except perhaps in spring--</TE>
<TE>   But I should never think of spring,</TE>
<TE>   For that would surely break my heart in two.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the larger dilemma with "Stardust Melody." Those lines,
that song (the best, but characteristic), come from a tough, tragic,
artistic intelligence. It may be that, most of the time, Carmichael
was resolved to mask that persona from the world, his family and even
from himself. Sudhalter is good at recording the life of the poor
Bloomington boy who became a Hoosier character, the piano player at
the arty Book Nook and a halfhearted law student who sooner or later
was going to settle for the perilous life of songwriter. And maybe
that Indiana sprite was so expert at concealing himself that the
biographer must keep bumping against locked doors.</TE>
<TE>   So we hear about a "storybook" marriage that suddenly ends. But
just as that romance has gone unexplored or unfelt, it's hard to
fathom the breakup. Yet the songs and the attitudinizing of the man
are intensely seductive. You only have to look at Carmichael to feel
a sexual atmosphere. There was an affair with the English actress
Jean Simmons, but she has not helped with the book and that's a big
loss.</TE>
<TE>   Equally, we gather that Carmichael was extremely tight with money.
He was likely to take you out to dinner but then split a steak with
you. Such stories are sketchy, and the book is woefully short on the
financial life of the career free-lancer. Every now and then, we
realize how wealthy he was from song royalties, but the daily
hardness of the miser and the unshakable Republican instincts (not
unknown in Indiana, or much questioned) are missing.</TE>
<TE>   The kid who loved "hot" jazz wasn't often out of control.
Sudhalter doesn't underline such things as the Indiana band that
played one of Carmichael's first great tunes, "Washboard Blues"
(1927): eight clean-cut white guys, most of them with center partings
in their groomed hair. Carmichael liked black music, and sometimes
heard it: "When those 'dinges' whipped that tune into a wild, almost
blood-curdling shriek of weird harmony as they came into the last
chorus, I got the spirit of jazz like a Congo medicine man. I wilted
to the floor!"</TE>
<TE>   I can believe that, yet I applaud Sudhalter's sticking with a word
like "dinges" because it reminds us of the definite racial barriers
in the Indiana of Carmichael's youth. He would be a friend of Louis
Armstrong's later (they both liked marijuana), but "Washboard Blues,"
written in the character of a poor black woman, is pretty close to
black-voice (akin to blackface).</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Sudhalter is reluctant to explore such things, or is being
kind to two sons who helped him a great deal on the book. Still, if
you're going to quote the music itself, then I'd like to know the
bank balance that went with it and the details of liaisons with women
who were lost the moment that dapper wolf asked them, "Did you say
something?"</TE>

<DH>THE BUREAU: The Secret History of the FBI, By Ronald
Kessler, St. Martin's: 488 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM W. TURNER</AU>
<BD>William W. Turner is a former FBI criminal and
counterintelligence agent. His most recent book is "Rearview Mirror:
Looking Back at the FBI, the CIA and Other Tails."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ronald Kessler opens "The Bureau," his comprehensive history of the
FBI, with Sept. 11 imagery: Barry Mawn, chief of the New York FBI
office, races to the World Trade Center as the twin towers flame. He
sees a female leg on the street severed at the knee, a pink sock and
white sneaker still on. The image haunts Mawn months later.</LD>
<LD>   Kessler's book could not be more timely. Sept. 11 was a monumental
counterintelligence failure, and Kessler wonders if the bureau can be
counted upon to disrupt terrorist cells before they again wreak
havoc. It's a life-and-death issue for the agency that is charged
with averting domestic terrorist attacks, an issue that perforce
looms over every page of this volume.</LD>
<LD>   Kessler, a Washington Post reporter during the Watergate era who
gained unprecedented access to a normally cloistered agency, deftly
lays out its checkered history. The bureau's problem dates from the
days of J. Edgar Hoover when the FBI's mystique sheltered it from
congressional oversight, allowing for a fit of jurisdictional
expansion that took it into fields unsuited for its gangbuster
mentality.</LD>
<TE>   How badly has the bureau stumbled in counterintelligence?</TE>
<TE>   The news last week that President Bush was given a CIA warning,
more than a month before Sept. 11, that Al Qaeda was plotting to
hijack airliners was shocking, in that the president failed to order
a special FBI investigation. It suggests a tragic, blind trust in the
bureau, which one month before had learned from its agents in Phoenix
that Islamic militants were taking lessons on how to fly commercial
jets and, from another source, that terrorists were planning to fly
planes into office buildings. Headquarters bureaucrats sat on their
hands with these two pieces of information.</TE>
<TE>   Or take the case of FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who spied for the
Russians for two decades after a Soviet diplomat tipped off an
unheeding FBI that he had offered his services. When sentenced to
life in prison earlier this month, the prosecutor said that Hanssen
had done incalculable damage to U.S. security.</TE>
<TE>   Hoover died in 1972 after nearly 48 years as director, but his
legacy remains."Even though none of the current agents served under
Hoover," Kessler writes, "they absorbed by osmosis his instruction
about not embarrassing the Bureau." A succession of directors,
confounded by an inflexible bureaucracy, avoided a shakeup. "The
Bureau" demonstrates that the past is prologue. Following a 1919 wave
of bombings attributed to anarchists, Hoover, then an ambitious
Justice Department aide, compiled 450,000 index cards on putative
radicals, profiling them through a mix of rumor, gossip and fact. He
then orchestrated dragnet detentions and deportations based on the
cards. But, as Kessler puts it, "No one was ever apprehended for the
bombings."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, there was an eerie echo of those Red Raids, when the
FBI rounded up thousands of Middle Eastern males and conducted mass
interrogations that proved fruitless. Kessler writes that, after
becoming FBI director in 1924, Hoover, consumed by image, insisted
that his minions dress like Wall Streeters. Applicants who looked
like foreigners were rejected. To this day the bureau is hardly a
model of diversity. On Sept. 11, there were only a dozen
Arabic-speaking agents.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has said that he intends to use secret
military tribunals to try accused Al Qaeda terrorists, citing as
precedent the World War II convictions of eight German saboteurs who
landed by submarine. Morale on the home front was buoyed by the FBI's
tale of how it tracked down the saboteurs. But Kessler tells the real
story: Two of the Germans, George Dasch and Ernst Burger, tried to
turn themselves and their comrades in to the FBI, but no one believed
their story. The purpose of the secret tribunal was to seal the
truth. Ashcroft couldn't have chosen a worse precedent.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler has a unique take on the wedge issue of Waco, Texas, where
in 1993 an FBI assault on the Branch Davidian cult compound killed
close to 80, many of them children. The bureau's paramilitary unit,
the Hostage Rescue Team, became impatient with the lengthy holdout
and wanted to move in. Kessler explains: "Because the various FBI
elements at the scene--the HRT, the negotiators, and the
profilers--did not come under one commander, the HRT won out."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler scolds media colleagues who taunted the FBI for its
inability to crack the Unabomber case. Between 1978 and 1995, a
terrorist mailed 16 package bombs that killed three people and maimed
others. Working off a profiler's depiction of a blue-collar type,
possibly an electrician or plumber, a task force chased its tail
until 1996, after newspapers published his manifesto and David
Kaczynski recognized the hand of his brother, Theodore, a former UC
Berkeley mathematics professor living as a recluse in Montana. But
Kessler is tolerant, offering that when a "killer drops a bomb in a
mailbox, it is very difficult to trace him." That may be why it is
taking so long to nab the anthrax killer.</TE>
<TE>   The tendency of the FBI to focus on a handy suspect to the
exclusion of all others was illustrated in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics
pipe bombing, which took two lives and injured scores of people. For
months, agents hounded the security guard who found the bomb, Richard
Jewell, whom they viewed as a false hero. In the meantime a
survivalist named Eric Rudolph was implicated in the bombings of two
women's clinics and a gay bar. Forensic evidence linked him to the
Atlanta crime, and he remains on the FBI's most-wanted list (along
with Osama bin Laden).</TE>
<TE>   Kessler blames the bureau's then-director Louis Freeh for dragging
out Jewell's ordeal. Freeh was a Mafia-busting street agent turned
federal judge when tapped by President Clinton in 1993. The field
agents welcomed him as one of their own, but they soon soured as he
proved arbitrary, full of hubris and dictatorial. He became known
among agents as "Hoover with children."</TE>
<TE>   It was on Freeh's watch that the 1999 Wen Ho Lee fiasco broke: The
case of the Los Alamos nuclear scientist accused of passing nuclear
secrets to Beijing who was held in solitary confinement for nine
months until the case fell apart. It was a burlesque of how to handle
a counterintelligence investigation. "The problem was the FBI's sheer
ineptitude," Kessler says of the Lee fiasco. It was not an anomaly.</TE>
<TE>   But the mother of all debacles was Sept. 11. It might have been
averted had the FBI capitalized on a huge break. As Kessler tells it,
in mid-August 2001 a Minnesota flight academy official called the
local FBI to report that a student "wanted to concentrate on
navigational skills and midair turns, not landings and takeoffs." The
official was sure that the student, Zacarias Moussaoui, intended to
turn a jumbo jet into a flying bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of clamping Moussaoui under surveillance, which is
standard procedure to identify others in a terrorist cell, the bureau
hauled him in on an immigration violation. So on Sept. 11, Moussaoui
sat in jail while Mohamed Atta and 18 comrades slammed hijacked
airliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, while another
crashed into a Pennsylvania field. That the FBI hadn't rolled up
Atta's cell by then spotlights its difficulty in processing the
information it collects.</TE>
<TE>   According to ABC News, FBI headquarters decided there was "no
proof" to trigger the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which
has long authorized taps, bugs and break-ins when there is a showing
of terrorist intent by a suspect with foreign connections. But I
think it was an unduly restrictive interpretation of federal law,
which permits such surveillance for up to a year.</TE>
<TE>   Though Kessler goes along with the FBI's excuse that it was
handcuffed by the intelligence act, he acknowledges that the bureau's
National Security Division, responsible for disrupting terrorist
cells, borders on the dysfunctional. And he puts his finger squarely
on the cause. "Typically, the more aggressive agents who enjoyed
tracking the Mafia or other violent criminals did not take to
counterintelligence, which was more cerebral." Nor were they suited
for it, because the subtleties of the counterintelligence trade call
for a more sophisticated type who might not flourish in the bureau's
anti-intellectual climate.</TE>
<TE>   But radical change is not on the agenda of the FBI's new director,
Robert Mueller, who has confined himself to tinkering. Nor does
Kessler lobby for a badly needed restructuring, though the evidence
for it leaps from these pages. "After Sept. 11, the FBI performed
flawlessly, helping to restore confidence in the agency," he
perorates.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bureau" has its soft spots. One is the spotty coverage of the
1950s "Red Menace," which was artificially hyperinflated. Kessler
doesn't report, as one bureau agent recently told me, that Hoover's
archvillain, Communist Party leader Gus Hall, was on the FBI's
informant payroll. Another is Kessler's naive conclusion that anyone
knowing about a conspiracy in the John F. Kennedy assassination
"would most likely have come forth."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the book stands as a compelling and timely
exposition of the real FBI. Kessler's fresh information and command
of the facts, even if his analysis is not always impeccable, rings
with authority. He should be the first witness before any
congressional body dedicated, in the interest of public safety, to
overhauling the FBI.</TE>

<AU>EUGEN WEBER</AU>
<BD>Eugen Weber is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We're in a pretty pickle when hackers can gobble every bit of
information that concerns us, from our Social Security number, to our
next date; when brutal computer games convert from virtual to real;
when malignant fantasies smear and scarify the world real people live
in. That is one predicament Robert Andrews' "A Murder of Promise"
sketches, and that his two detective lieutenants, Frank Kearney and
Jose Phelps, have to face.</LD>
<LD>   The most senior homicide investigators in Washington, D.C.'s
Metropolitan Police Dept., Kearney and Phelps confront an ingenious
serial killer who stalks his prey on the Internet and dispatches them
with cruel stab wounds, planning his moves and plying his gory trade
with cool deliberation.</LD>
<LD>   They have to endure a despicable commander who wants to be head of
the homicide division but doesn't want to deal with homicides, or
offend the media, or roil his political bosses. They have to fight
their way through enough paperwork to kill whole forests; past
politically powerful witnesses; through hazes of politically correct
jargon and law that has been enlisted in the service of lawlessness
while they make haste before the killer strikes again.</LD>
<TE>   Undeterred by the cold smells of death, they hunt down the
psychopath and go home to feed the cat.</TE>
<TE>   An eminent and knowledgeable Washingtonian, Andrews knows whereof
he writes. His tale provides a bustling topography of the district, a
perceptive profile of intra-police relations, a lusty description of
malignant monstrousness. Last, but not least, all who distrust
politics and, even more, politicians will enjoy this book.</TE>
<TE>   Robert M. Eversz once worked in and around Hollywood. We can see
what he thought of Tinseltown from the fact that he left it for
Prague, where he makes his home in much the same spirit as W.C.
Fields, who would rather be in Philadelphia. If he really lives in
that broody city, he needs a strong sense of humor; and "Killing
Paparazzi" exhibits plenty of that, though without much good humor.</TE>
<TE>   Just released from prison, Nina Zero is danger on wheels: perilous
to herself, to those she encounters and to those she pursues. But she
creates and endures mayhem in an incandescently detached way: not
just about the paparazzi and the working girls gruesomely slain
around her, but also for the wretches who cross her and get crippled
for it. In L.A.'s three-ring circus, Nina is the angry clown who
turns torment into farce, suffering into slapstick, pratfalls into
survival skills. Where Robert B. Parker's Spenser is flippant, Nina's
choler smolders, just waiting to explode. And Eversz's dark comedy
verges on sadism.</TE>
<TE>   In Julia Spencer-Fleming's entry to the mystery stakes, "In the
Bleak Midwinter," Clare Fergusson is the new priest of the Episcopal
church at Millers Kill in upstate New York. As her welcome reception
winds down, an abandoned newborn baby is discovered bundled up at the
door of St. Alban's. Soon, a young woman is brutally murdered. Fresh
and fit from eight years as an Army chaplain, Clare joins the chief
of police in search of explanations.</TE>
<TE>   Her initiatives flutter local dovecotes and place her life in
danger. But she is as tenacious as she is impetuous, knows how to
tough things out and even learns to drive through "the bleak
midwinter." This is Spencer-Fleming's first novel, and a very
promising job it is. Very professional too: an attractive heroine as
thoughtful about others as she is thoughtless about herself, a
convincing male lead, original situations and an engaging tale.</TE>
<TE>   Death, says an Arab proverb, is the midnight runner; and there is
a lot of death in Jack Higgins' latest of that title. A lot of
drinking also (mostly Irish and most often champagne), a lot of
violence, a lot of money and a lot of thrills. "Midnight Runner's"
predecessor featured a hugely wealthy Anglo-Arab clan, the Rashids,
all of whose male members were wiped out by the end. Good riddance;
but the female of the species is more deadly than the male.</TE>
<TE>   Kate, the family's only survivor, now heads the Rashid bedouin
tribe and the Rashid business empire. She is venomously determined to
exact revenge on those who, provoked by the Rashids, had struck back
with deadly force. Her quest for vengeance and the collateral damage
that it strews around stir up old foes as determined as Kate.
Recourse to the Law won't do because you cannot rely on law when you
are seeking justice. So rival jihads face off. Washington, Belfast
and Irish pub country, London and the English Home Counties and the
Arabian peninsula and its oil wells become the stage where
skulduggery punctuated by wild action plays out. It's a relief to
find that, in the end, however, even when not quite sober, the
protagonists in Higgins' latest are more than a match for their foes.</TE>

<HD>Fox Hits 'Delete,' to Delight of Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For once, we won't talk about Rick Fox's words. We'll talk about his
play. Then we'll talk about his words.</LD>
<LD>   Fox took out Sacramento forward Hedo Turkoglu on Saturday. Wiped
him out as quickly as a few strokes of the backspace key can take out
a word on your computer.</LD>
<LD>   Fox D'd up on Turkoglu and had another smart, efficient session on
offense to help the Lakers to that decisive first quarter against the
Sacramento Kings that helped them win Game 1 and quite possibly the
entire Western Conference finals.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings were playing catch-up all afternoon Saturday, and
they'll spend the next two days doing it as well. Meanwhile, Turkoglu
will still be trying to score his first point of the series on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He missed all eight shots Saturday. He was so out of it that he
didn't even get to take one in the fourth quarter, when he sat for
all but one minute.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to hand it to Rick," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.
"He jumped in [Turkoglu's] jock and made it difficult for him right
off the bat to get shots. That was one of the keys to this game."</TE>
<TE>   As much yang as Fox was talking before the series, he needed to do
something once it started. He was coming off his best game of the
playoffs, a 17-point, seven-rebound effort in Game 5 against San
Antonio, and when the Lakers came out in an offensive groove
Saturday, it helped Fox keep gliding along. He's a perfect fit for
the triangle, a man who understands spacing and ball movement and all
that old-school North Carolina stuff. He had four assists and made
two of three shots (including a three-pointer) in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings complement the triangle pretty well, too. They didn't
rotate or recover the way San Antonio did, leading to open Laker
shots throughout the quarter. To Fox, it was further evidence of a
Sacramento characteristic he had discussed at length on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about their ability to play defensively to an extent,"
Fox reminded us Saturday. "They're good at it at early points in the
shot clock. They gamble, they get some steals. But if you sit them
down and you move the ball and you make them work defensively, then
you get better shots."</TE>
<TE>   It sure feels good to be right.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to back up what we said to begin with," Fox said. "I
said we were going to win the series. That's only one game. Right now
we have a lot of unfinished business."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Lakers just swiped the home-court advantage that
the Kings earned all season--the edge they thought would propel them
past the Lakers for their first time after consecutive playoff losses
to them--the Lakers actually let the Kings off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   They could have buried them and crushed any hopes they had of
winning this series. Instead the Kings have to feel confident they
can bounce back. They just absorbed the Lakers' best game of the
playoffs, but still came back enough to have a chance at grabbing a
victory until the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings did it despite losing out on as many officials' calls as
you will ever see go against a home team. They did it without the
injured Peja Stojakovic. For that matter, they did it without
Turkoglu. He's averaging seven points per game in the playoffs. They
lost, 106-99. Do the math.</TE>
<TE>   Fox denied Turkoglu the ball, forced him to uncomfortable spots on
the floor when he did get it and contested his shots. And, yes, Fox
was aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he was gonna do all that grabbing," Turkoglu said. "I
don't want to complain. I'll try to go to the hole."</TE>
<TE>   He needs to be more aggressive, because his confidence clearly
waned with every minute. On his final shot, he hesitated, then
finally-- reluctantly--launched a jumper that wasn't even close.</TE>
<TE>   Turkoglu was one of the question marks I had about the Kings
before this series. He didn't make the Big Leap this season after
showing signs he could do a little bit of everything last season.</TE>
<TE>   I'll give him props for this: He stuck around after the game to
face the reporters and discuss his non-performance Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "They really need me," Turkoglu said. "All other guys were doing
their job good. I couldn't do my job well."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt this was a job well done for Fox, who finished with nine
points, five assists and a blocked shot. And he's a fourth of the way
toward making good on his prediction.</TE>
<TE>   "We're one step closer to being prophets," Fox said. "When both
sides are talking a lot of trash like we did--which we'll put aside
and just play the games the rest of the way--someone's going to come
out looking like a genius. And right now, we're 1-up."</TE>
<TE>   The trash-talking cease-fire lasted about as long as that Kramer
guy's solo TV show after "Seinfeld." Fox couldn't resist noting how
the Lakers hushed the crowd when they outscored the Kings, 36-22, in
the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite the interesting start to the game, when you have an
arena going for the Guinness Book of World Records for the loudest
crowd, and then five minutes later it's the quietest crowd," Fox
said. "That was fun, too."</TE>
<TE>   Fox came through with one of the supporting performances the
Lakers need behind the usual 50-plus from O'Neal and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick played great tonight," Robert Horry said. "He's not going to
get enough credit for that. He kept the guy from getting some easy
shots because he came out and tried to be aggressive. Rick was right
there, being aggressive with him, keeping the ball out of his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick deserves a big star tonight."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rain, cold and the Seattle Mariners didn't stop Boston's Pedro
Martinez from dominating the American League West leaders again.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Sox defeated the Mariners, 4-1, Saturday at Boston, and
Martinez improved to 10-0 with a 0.94 earned-run average in 10 starts
against Seattle despite pitching in difficult conditions.</LD>
<LD>   "The guy can pitch," Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said. "Whether
it's the Mojave Desert or an igloo in Alaska, what's the difference?"</LD>
<TE>   The game was played despite a downpour that started before dawn
and ended about an hour after the scheduled start. The delay lasted 2
hours 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The teams wanted to play the game because Seattle's last
regular-season game at Fenway Park is today.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez couldn't explain his success against the team with the
second-best record in the majors at 29-13.</TE>
<TE>   Boston (28-11) has the majors' best record.</TE>
<TE>   "I just go out there and try my best," he said. "I always had the
support of my teammates who always seem to be right on top of their
game at the time we've played them and I'm pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (6-0) struck out nine in eight innings, gave up six hits
and walked none. He went to a three-ball count against only three of
the 29 batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   In the first inning, he struck out the side on nine pitches, the
first Red Sox pitcher to do that and the 35th in major league
history.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming out of the bullpen, you're pretty warmed up and you just
want to let it go right away," he said. "I knew it would take them a
little while before they got loose. So I took advantage of that."</TE>
<TE>   When the game started, the temperature was 41 degrees with winds
out of the northwest at 23 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get loose and to stay loose," Boston catcher Jason
Varitek said. "Both pitchers pitched very well in those conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox scored twice in the first inning against James Baldwin
(3-4) on doubles by Jose Offerman and Nomar Garciaparra and a single
by Brian Daubach.</TE>
<TE>   "If you give up a couple of runs," said Baldwin, who lost to
Martinez six days earlier at Seattle, "that's a lot of runs against a
pitcher like Pedro."</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Minnesota 2--Alfonso Soriano homered for the third
consecutive game, hitting a tiebreaking three-run drive against Bob
Wells in the sixth inning at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees have homered in 10 consecutive games and have 21 in
their last six, raising their major league-leading total to 69.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee starter Ted Lilly (1-3) wasted a 2-0 lead but won for the
first time in five starts. He gave up both runs--one earned--and five
hits in seven innings. He struck out nine.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Oakland 3--Former Oakland prospect Eric Hinske hit a
three-run homer, helping the Blue Jays win their first series at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland has lost 12 of 15. The Blue Jays won the first two games
of the three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Hinske, acquired from Oakland along with rookie starter Justin
Miller (3-1) for closer Billy Koch in the off-season, homered against
Mike Fyhrie (1-3) to give Toronto a 6-0 lead in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Miller gave up three runs in 52/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 8, Texas 7--Robert Fick hit a tiebreaking run-scoring
single with two out in the eighth inning at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit trailed, 7-6, in the eighth, but Ramon Santiago drove in
the tying run with his third hit, stole second and scored on Fick's
single to right-center field.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 5, Baltimore 4--Greg Vaughn ended a nine-month homerless
drought in a big way, connecting twice, including a tiebreaking
two-run drive in the ninth inning at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn had not homered in 222 at-bats dating to Aug. 5 before
hitting a solo homer against starter Sidney Ponson in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   He belted a 2-and-1 pitch from Jorge Julio into the left-field
seats in the ninth to break a 3-3 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4-1, Cleveland 2-4-- Ryan Drese (4-3) struck out 10 in
eight innings, and Omar Vizquel hit a three-run homer to give the
Indians a split of a day-night doubleheader at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Drese used a split-finger fastball to keep the Royals off-balance.
The rookie right-hander gave up four hits.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, Mark Quinn hit a run-scoring double in Kansas
City's two-run ninth inning against Bob Wickman (0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Quinn's double scored pinch-runner Donnie Sadler, and A.J. Hinch
had a run-scoring groundout in the ninth.</TE>

<HD>Ortiz Given Round-Trip Ticket</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He gives up four homers as Angels' eight-game win
streak is ended by Chicago, 10-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The unlucky number is 13. That's the number of home runs Ramon Ortiz
has given up this season. No major league pitcher has given up more.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, after the Chicago White Sox bashed four home runs off Ortiz
in a 10-4 victory Saturday, the Angels talked less about concern over
his tendency to surrender the long ball and more about his
development as an emerging ace.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Thomas tagged Ortiz for two home runs and Paul Konerko and
Jose Valentin each tagged him for one, as the Angels' eight-game
winning streak died on another chilly evening at Comiskey Park. Just
as the team played well in many facets of the game during all that
winning, the team played poorly in many facets of the game Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The starting pitcher gave up four home runs in six innings. The
relievers, Mark Lukasiewicz and Ben Weber, combined to give up four
runs in two innings. Errors by Lukasiewicz and third baseman Troy
Glaus snapped a 61-inning errorless streak and contributed to two
unearned runs. The Angels left 13 runners on base and went three for
15 with men in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Ortiz had spoiled the Angels. For the first time this
year, he gave up more than four runs.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels were anxious to see how he responded to adversity,
and on that score he received a passing grade. Four times he gave up
a home run, but four times he retired the next batter. That pleased
pitching coach Bud Black, who noted that a home run in previous years
would often be followed by a walk.</TE>
<TE>   "What we see is a guy who gives up a lot of homers but pitches
aggressively," Black said. "He's not afraid to challenge guys. In the
past, you might have seen him pitch defensively at times, and that
could lead to a few more walks."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz walked one and struck out seven Saturday. He has struck out
48 and walked 14 this season, a ratio of 3.4 strikeouts to each walk.
He struck out 135 and walked 76 last season, a ratio of 1.8.</TE>
<TE>   And, by keeping walks to a minimum, the damage from home runs also
can be kept to a minimum. Of the 13 homers he has given up, 10 have
come with no one on base.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can say the home runs have killed Ramon," Angel
Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz still ranks among league leaders in earned-run average
(3.30) and strikeouts. He's 4-4, but the Angels have scored seven
runs in his four losses--and 41 in his four victories.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about home runs," Ortiz said. "I just care about
making my pitches."</TE>
<TE>   On that score, the results were mixed. After the very first
batter, catcher Jorge Fabregas had to call timeout to calm Ortiz and
remind him to keep his pitches down. And, although one of the home
runs shattered Thomas' bat and left the Angels shaking their heads,
Fabregas suggested that Ortiz ought not to have thrown the slider
that Konerko hit out.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz faced the White Sox eight days ago in Anaheim, and Konerko
homered that day. On the pitch Konerko hit out Saturday, Fabregas
called for a fastball. Ortiz shook him off and opted for the slider,
which he hung.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a feeling [Konerko] was waiting for it," Fabregas said. "I
wanted to throw a fastball inside. But, if Ramon gets that slider
down, it's probably an out."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did their share of hitting too, albeit not in the
clutch. They outhit the White Sox, 11-10. Brad Fullmer, whose batting
average was .183 three weeks ago, had three hits to lift his average
to .294. He failed to hit a home run in April, but his homer Saturday
gave him three in his last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad, whose batting average fell to .188 last month,
lifted his average above .300 for the first time since April 2. He
extended his hitting streak to eight games.</TE>
<TE>   And, although they lost, the Angels can win their seventh
consecutive series with a victory today.</TE>
<TE>   "If we thought we were going to win them all, we were sadly
mistaken," Fabregas said. "[But] if we win every series, we'll be
OK."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Anderson Addresses Issue of Steroids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Garret Anderson won't name the fellow major leaguers who taunted him,
but when Anderson hit a career-high 35 home runs two years ago, they
weren't shy about asking him, "Are you on steroids?"</LD>
<LD>   "It was just because I started hitting a lot of home runs,"
Anderson said. "I thought it was hilarious."</LD>
<LD>   Jose Canseco raised the issue of steroid use Friday, claiming in a
television interview that 85% of major leaguers used steroids and
that "there would be no baseball left if they drug-tested everyone."</LD>
<TE>   While players in the Angel clubhouse tended to laugh off the
figure cited by Canseco, no one denied that some major leaguers do
use steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in sports and not just ours, to some degree," Anderson said.
"You see guys getting bigger and stronger very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   That was the logic behind those opposing players taunting
Anderson, though his home-run total had gradually increased from
eight to 15 to 21 in the three years before he hit 35. Anderson said
he focuses on diet, rest and proper workouts and does not even take
nutritional supplements.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm scared to take aspirin," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The players' union has yet to embrace testing for steroids,
concerned about privacy issues and about how a testing program might
be expanded beyond steroids. Said one Angel: "It could be like the
Olympics, where you can't drink a cup of coffee."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a testing program would remove the cloud of suspicion that
surrounds players who get better in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   "They could say he did it," Anderson said, "as opposed to
wondering how he did it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary DiSarcina, the Angels' opening day shortstop for nine
consecutive seasons, played the first game of his career outside the
Angel organization Friday. DiSarcina, 34, played second base for
triple-A Pawtucket and doubled twice in three at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   DiSarcina missed most of the last two seasons after shoulder
surgery, and the Angels allowed him to leave as a free agent. He
signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox, the team he
grew up cheering for, but a broken finger in spring training delayed
the start of his season. If he plays well, the Red Sox could promote
him as a utility infielder.</TE>

<HD>Salaries Cap Dodgers' Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It can be said of the Dodger offense that what you see is what you
get.</LD>
<LD>   That's a chilling prospect for a pitching staff that faces disk
damage if it has to carry the offense through a long summer.</LD>
<LD>   However, the cold reality is that given the large and inflexible
contracts handcuffing General Manager Dan Evans and management's
rigid determination--for now, at least--to avoid expanding a
$102-million payroll, it's unlikely the Dodgers will be adding a
proven run producer any time soon.</LD>
<TE>   That's not to say Evans doesn't have scouts out surveying the
market, but for now it seems they're just staying in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Our roster is more complicated than most teams," Evans
acknowledged. "I don't have the maneuverability I'd like to have and
hope to have in a few years, but that doesn't preclude us from
producing enough offense.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew going into the season that we wouldn't have the best
offense, that we'd be somewhere in the middle of the pack, and I'm OK
with that.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect an offensive juggernaut."</TE>
<TE>   Good thing, since the Dodger offense has been more naught than
juggernaut.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, as Evans put it, his club has been dodging a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers began play Saturday night against the Montreal Expos
six games over .500 despite having been shut out a major league-high
eight times. It seems that a $102-million payroll these days buys
good pitching, good defense and ... well, you can only stretch a
dollar so far.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the return of Dave Roberts Friday and the anticipated return
of Brian Jordan from nagging injuries, and a four-game series with
Montreal--none of them started by the Expos' talented Javier
Vazquez--will revitalize an offense last or close to it in most
National League categories. The Dodgers scored 12 runs--a bonanza for
them--in winning the series' first two games.</TE>
<TE>   They dominated the National League in the early to mid-1960s with
great pitching and the stolen base gymnastics of Maury Wills, but
whether they can keep pace in the wickedly tough West on pitching
alone is problematic. NL hitting is down overall, but then the
Dodgers alone have contributed significantly to that slide.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were asking people to perform at a level beyond their
capability I'd be more concerned," Evans said. "I'm not going to
panic. These guys are going to hit. We don't have to score six or
seven runs a game."</TE>
<TE>   Scoring one or two has been troublesome. Thus, the roster
complexities Evans inherited from Kevin Malone, although the Sheriff
wasn't operating in a vacuum. All of his major investments needed the
approval of Fox superiors.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, said the general manager of an NL West team, "Dan is in
a difficult situation when he picks up the phone. He has a lot of
players he can't move because of their age or contract situation,
sometimes both. He has to hope he can get enough out of them to
justify what they're making."</TE>
<TE>   It's a numbing prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Consider that Kevin Brown, 37 and coming off elbow surgery, is
owed $45 million for three years beyond 2002, and that Shawn Green,
struggling in the middle of the lineup and benched Saturday night, is
owed $47 million for that same period, and that Darren Dreifort,
sidelined after his second elbow reconstruction, is owed $45 million
for a similar span.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's first baseman Eric Karros, 34 and in his third
consecutive season of power falloff, who is owed $8 million next year
with a $9-million vesting option in 2004; starter Andy Ashby, 34 and
coming off elbow surgery, who is owed $8 million next year with an
$8.5-million vesting option in 2004; infielder Mark Grudzielanek,
whom the Dodgers have unsuccessfully tried to trade and is guaranteed
$6 million over the next two years, and the newly acquired Jordan,
who would love to be with his family in Atlanta and, at 35, is
guaranteed $9 million next year (if he doesn't exercise his trade
rights) and will receive either $10.5 million through a 2004 option
or a $2.5-million buyout.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Dodgers got out from under Gary Sheffield's
obligation (and diatribes) in obtaining Jordan and won't have to pay
Marquis Grissom $5 million next year.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, they still had to pick up the final $3.75 million owed
Tom Goodwin despite his recent release, which is enough to create
breakfast indigestion on a peaceful Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that Evans--further handcuffed by the lack of
substantial help from the farm system and limited as to where he
would plug in a new hitter unless Jordan is moved to center and the
promising Roberts is benched--seems to have only two realistic
options when considering a trade for help on offense.</TE>
<TE>   He could deal pitcher Omar Daal, who has enhanced his
marketability with his excellent and critical performances as a
starter and reliever--but who also represents the Dodgers' only
insurance policy if Brown, Ashby or another pitcher is injured.</TE>
<TE>   He could trade third baseman Adrian Beltre, but if Beltre would be
attractive to other clubs because of his age (23), potential and
modest contract, he remains attractive to the Dodgers for those same
reasons, although he has frustrated some in the organization by
failing to provide the power associated with his position.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a stretch to think the Philadelphia Phillies would jump
at Beltre in trade for Scott Rolen, whose determination to leave
Philadelphia as a free agent at the end of the season is underscored
by his personality clashes with Manager Larry Bowa.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen would pump up the Dodger offense in a hurry, but it would be
foolish to give up Beltre without first reaching a contract agreement
with Rolen, which would require about $15 million a year, probably
more than the Dodgers are willing to pay considering their operating
losses--$54 million in 2001, according to baseball's figures, or an
estimated $29 million, according to Forbes.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig recently was asked about the Forbes story
challenging baseball's financial figures and said:</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I could go to Princeton and talk about Einstein's theory
of relativity and I wouldn't know anything more about it than Forbes
knows about our numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Even Einstein might not be able to help Evans work his way out of
the Dodgers' roster equation.</TE>

<LD>The Arizona Diamondbacks, riddled by injuries but still leading the
National League West, are getting stronger as they eye their first
home-and-home series with the Dodgers, starting next weekend in
Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Erubiel Durazo, who was baseball's hottest spring hitter when he
broke his right hand in mid-March and hasn't lost a beat as indicated
by his three home runs Friday night, returned to first base Thursday,
putting Mark Grace on the bench.</LD>
<LD>   Closer Matt Mantei will return from elbow reconstruction at the
end of the month to join Byung-Hyun Kim at the back of the bullpen,
giving Manager Bob Brenly more options.</LD>
<TE>   Matt Williams, who has a broken ankle, won't be back until after
the All-Star break and Jay Bell, out because of a torn calf muscle,
is still two or three weeks away, but General Manager Joe Garagiola
Jr. said Durazo and Mantei represent impact additions.</TE>
<TE>   "To be 11 games over .500 [as the Diamondbacks were before
Friday's games], at or near the top of our division and now see some
of our key people either back or on the horizon, you have to feel
good," Garagiola said. "I mean, to have stayed on the pace without
them has to be encouraging. I think a lot of teams would trade for
our won-lost record."</TE>
<TE>   Although Arizona still is searching for consistency behind Randy
Johnson and Curt Schilling, who were a combined 15-2 before the
weekend, while four other starters were 6-11, that part of it also
may be clearing up. Garagiola said Rick Helling, Miguel Batista and
Brian Anderson all gave Arizona a reasonable chance to win in their
last starts.</TE>
<TE>   "If they keep up that level ... that's all you can ask," Garagiola
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What George wants, he still gets.</TE>
<TE>   It was Christmas Eve, long after the New York Yankees had acquired
Robin Ventura from the cross-town Mets and signed Jason Giambi,
Rondell White and Steve Karsay as free agents. General Manager Brian
Cashman and staff thought they had done all they needed to do, had
pushed the budget as far as they could and certainly didn't have room
for one more starting pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the Boss.</TE>
<TE>   Making amends for having traded Yankee-to-the-bone David Wells
three years earlier--in the Roger Clemens deal--and ignoring that
Wells would be 39 in April and had been in only 16 games last year
before disk surgery, George Steinbrenner personally signed the portly
left-hander to a two-year, $6-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, with a 13-0 shutout of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
Wells improved his record to 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   His 40-15 record as a Yankee gives him a .727 winning percentage,
best among Yankee pitchers with more than 50 decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Said Wells, "Now that I'm back, I'm just trying to make every
outing count, make it memorable."</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Joe Torre of Steinbrenner's unexpected signing: "It
was a stroke of genius, which doesn't surprise any of us. It was a
Christmas present for him, and as it turns out, everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He was the first player to steal 40 bases and hit 40 home runs in
the same season. He hit 462 homers, drove in 1,407 runs, won a
most-valuable-player award and two World Series rings, but Jose
Canseco's numbers leave him short of Cooperstown.</TE>
<TE>   If, in addition, his defense deteriorated, many have said that his
focus and priorities went with it.</TE>
<TE>   Prompted by Canseco's retirement last week, former Oakland
teammate Dave Henderson, now a broadcaster with the Seattle Mariners,
said Canseco lacked the commitment to sustain his early prowess, quit
on the 1990 A's in their World Series loss to the Cincinnati Reds and
became so lackadaisical in the field that "We all said, 'Get him out
of here.'"</TE>
<TE>   Added Henderson: "He was once the picture of speed, power and good
defense, but he got lost, got bored. The defense faded, the speed
faded, he became another average player, a guy who only hit home
runs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allard Baird, the Kansas City Royals' general manager, said it had
nothing to do with his decision to hire Tony Pena as manager, but two
unidentified players, one believed to be former Yankee Chuck
Knoblauch, had come to him and said they would ask to be traded if
Buck Showalter was hired, as many had expected. Showalter helped
build championship teams in New York and Arizona, but his
accomplishments tend to be overshadowed by his reputation as a
control-obsessed manager.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand how networking and word of mouth goes," Showalter
said, after losing out in Kansas City. "I know I've always tried to
treat people the way I would like to be treated. I can tell you,
those players don't know me."</TE>
<TE>   Any manager would have a tough time turning around the Royals, but
Pena made it clear he's in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the new DJ," he said. "I play the music and you have to
dance. If you don't know how to dance, get off the floor."</TE>

<HD>Prior to Start for Cubs Wednesday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former USC right-hander Mark Prior will make his highly anticipated
debut with the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday after only three starts at
triple A.</LD>
<LD>   Prior, the second overall selection in the 2001 draft, will pitch
at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm worried about the expectations that are going to be placed on
Mark," General Manager Andy MacPhail said. "It's a big step walking
out there for the first time and then to bring him in when the team
is struggling and have that kind of media attention that he's
garnered through his career, it's going to be hard to meet those
expectations."</LD>
<TE>   Prior, 21, considered by some the best college pitcher ever, was
dominant in nine minor league starts. He was 5-2 with a 2.29
earned-run average in double A and triple A. He had 79 strikeouts in
51 innings.</TE>
<TE>   In three starts at triple-A Iowa, Prior was 1-1 with a 1.65 ERA
and 24 strikeouts in 161/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't doubt that he'll go through some rough outings," MacPhail
said. "It's unfair to expect he'll be dominant in the major leagues
the way he's dominated in the minor leagues. But it's pretty evident
that he's ready, and it's pretty evident that we can use him here."</TE>
<TE>   Prior made an immediate impression on the Cubs during spring
training.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't tell this guy was one of the most touted pitchers
coming out of college the way he handled himself in spring training,"
Manager Don Baylor said. "He was willing to listen, to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing I can tell him. He has to experience that first
inning for himself, get his feet on the ground and let him pitch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Legislature sent Gov. Jesse Ventura a Twins' stadium
financing plan Saturday night, although leaders of the endangered
franchise haven't decided whether to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   The bill cleared the House, 72-61, and the Senate followed shortly
after with a 49-18 vote. Ventura hasn't said how he'd treat the bill,
although Finance Commissioner Pam Wheelock said it generally conforms
to the governor's wishes.</TE>
<TE>   It's the furthest the Twins have gotten in a stadium quest that
began seven years ago. And, if successfully carried out, the proposal
might stave off a plan by baseball to eliminate the low-revenue
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   But the Twins weren't celebrating the action. Instead, they spent
Saturday highlighting their concerns and questioning whether it will
result in a new ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "The test or whether or not this bill is successful is whether it
builds a new ballpark and attracts a new owner, and we're not there
yet," Twin President Jerry Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the bill saves the team, he answered: "We're not
making any promises, but we'll do the best we can."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Strangis, an attorney hired by Twins' owner Carl Pohlad to
find a new owner, issued a statement before the House vote asking
negotiators to return to the bargaining table. He urged them to
produce a bill that allows Hennepin County to join Minneapolis in its
bid to keep the Twins in that city.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become increasingly clear--as we review future ownership
options--that unless the stadium bill allows for multiple site and
local government funding options, it dramatically reduces the
likelihood that the Minnesota Twins can stay in Minnesota," Strangis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bell testified that two potential buyers, whom he didn't identify,
wanted Hennepin County in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   The House defeated an attempt by Minneapolis-area lawmakers to
send the bill back to conference committee.</TE>

<LD>That wasn't exactly a piece of baseball history for auction on eBay
the other day.</LD>
<LD>   It was three bone chips from Seattle reliever Jeff Nelson's elbow.</LD>
<LD>   Bidding reached an astounding $23,600 within about 24 hours before
eBay halted the auction because the site prohibits the sale of body
parts.</LD>
<TE>   EBay had halted previous attempts to sell a kidney and a liver, as
well as an auction by a man trying to sell his soul.</TE>
<TE>   "An eBay seller has to be in position to deliver the product,"
said Kevin Pursglove, eBay's senior director of communications.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, inspired by the $10,000 fetched by Arizona outfielder Luis
Gonzalez's gum last month, acknowledged trying to sell the chips was
"kind of sick and gross."</TE>
<TE>   But he planned to give half of the proceeds to Bear Creek High in
Redmond, attended by his daughters, with the other half designated
for the Curtis Williams fund at the University of Washington in honor
of the paralyzed football player who died recently.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can make money for charities for something that was going to
get put in the trash, why not?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Put the following WNBA teams in geographical order,
west to east: Mystics, Mercury, Monarchs, Miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Timeout: Bryon Russell of the Utah Jazz will graduate from Long
Beach State this month, nine years after leaving for the NBA in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Give him credit, but understand this: He won't be the wealthiest
among the new grads.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Spielberg also will be picking up his 49er diploma, more
than 30 years after leaving school without his bachelor's degree in
1969 to launch his film-making career.</TE>
<TE>   Lying in wait: In honor of the Colorado Avalanche-Detroit Red Wing
playoff series, the Detroit Free Press and Denver Post have launched
an insult-hurling contest.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Furman of Englewood, Colo., became the first Avalanche fan to
be published.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you hear that on the Wings' bus they hooked up a lie
detector?" he writes.</TE>
<TE>   "[Nicklas] Lidstrom hooks himself up and says, 'I think we have
the best defense in the league.'</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately, the lie detector goes off.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sergei] Fedorov hooks himself up and says, 'I think I'm the best
hockey player in the game.'</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately, the lie detector goes off.</TE>
<TE>   "[Darren] McCarty steps up and says, 'I think ... ' and,
immediately, the lie detector goes off."</TE>
<TE>   Life of a mucker: The Red Wings' Kirk Maltby is the sort of feisty
hockey player who is always getting whacked in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Albom of the Free Press decided to ask him a few questions.</TE>
<TE>   "Were you a fighter in school?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no," Maltby said. "I never got suspended."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't ask if you got suspended," Albom said.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Maltby said with a smile. "Everyone deserves detention
once in a while."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Sacramento Monarchs, Phoenix Mercury, Orlando
Miracle, Washington Mystics.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Seattle Mariner trainer Rick Griffin, pondering the
price that might have been fetched by Nelson's bone chips:</TE>
<TE>   "I can sell Ichiro's stitches. I still have them."</TE>

<HD>Green Takes Seat, Dodgers Still Struggle</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Tracy hopes night off will help slugger shake his
slump, but Expos keep L.A. down, 3-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers found futility again Saturday night, managing seven hits
in a 3-1 loss to the Montreal Expos before 42,881 in Dodger Stadium,
but unlike so many arid offensive evenings of the past, this one
could not be pinned on Shawn Green.</LD>
<LD>   The struggling right fielder and No. 3 batter was benched for the
first time in his three-year Dodger career, a surprising move Manager
Jim Tracy hopes will help Green end a season-long slump that worsened
last week, when Green went hitless in 15 at-bats and failed to drive
a ball out of the infield in five games.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy said Friday he had given no thought to benching Green or
dropping him in the order, but those sentiments changed during a
meeting with Green late Friday night. Green had missed only two
previous games as a Dodger, one because of injury and one to observe
a Jewish holiday.</LD>
<TE>   "We had a little bit of a chat [Friday] night about some things,
and I told him I think it's a good idea to give him a day off," Tracy
said. "He was in agreement. I want to get him away from the action
for a day."</TE>
<TE>   But could one day turn into two or three? Asked if Green would
play today, Tracy said, "I don't know the answer to that question
yet. We're going day to day."</TE>
<TE>   Green said he was not disturbed by Tracy's insinuation he might
sit for more than one game. "Why should I be?" Green said. "There's
nothing to be stirred up here."</TE>
<TE>   Green hit .297 with a franchise-record 49 home runs and 125 runs
batted in last season, but he has struggled to fulfill the
expectations his career year produced, batting .230 with three homers
and 21 RBIs in 41 games, amassing more strikeouts (39) than hits (35)
and grounding into a major league-high 12 double plays.</TE>
<TE>   Some scouts believe opponents have pitched Green more carefully
now that he is no longer protected in the lineup by slugger Gary
Sheffield, and Green's team-high 23 walks, including nine in his last
six games, provide some support for that claim.</TE>
<TE>   But both Green and Tracy believe the slump has nothing to do with
Sheffield's absence, or a sore left hand or a lack of confidence.
They believe Green simply hasn't corrected some mechanical flaws in
his swing.</TE>
<TE>   "You go through a list of different swing thoughts, and after a
while you realize that it's just a matter of it working itself out,"
Green said. "I never beat myself up mentally. I'm doing the best I
can."</TE>
<TE>   Green has spent countless hours in the cage working with coach
Jack Clark, and is still searching for a solution. Though he leads
the team in RBIs, Green is on pace to hit only 11 home runs, and he
has only eight multiple-hit games.</TE>
<TE>   He hates the thought of not playing, but Green couldn't put up
much of an argument with Tracy. Despite a .500 career average (5 for
10), two homers and five RBIs against Expo starter Carl Pavano, Green
did not play Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it helps to take a step back," Green said. "You can let
your mind rest when you sit on the bench. When you stay a little
detached, maybe you see things from a different perspective. I don't
like doing it, but at the same time, it's the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   What Green witnessed Saturday night was pitcher Odalis Perez's
first loss since his Dodger debut against San Francisco on April 4.
The left-hander gave up solo home runs to Fernando Tatis in the
second inning and Orlando Cabrera in the fourth and a sacrifice fly
to Jose Vidro in the fifth. Perez (4-2) gave up six hits in six
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Pavano, the right-hander who gave up 14 runs and 20 hits in 13
inning of his last three starts, was sharp Saturday night, giving up
one run and six hits in 71/3 innings. The right-hander got an assist
from first-base umpire Tim McClelland, who missed a call in the
second inning.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca led off with a double, and Mark Grudzielanek sent a
sinking liner to shallow right field. Vladimir Guerrero made a diving
catch, but Lo Duca, thinking the ball was trapped, went to third.</TE>
<TE>   McClelland ruled Grudzielanek out, even though replays clearly
showed the ball hit the ground before Guerrero's glove, and the Expos
received the benefit of the out--Lo Duca was easily doubled off
second to end the inning.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Nomo Will Stay Put</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though Dodger starter Hideo Nomo was credited with the victory over
Montreal on Friday night, the right-hander was unable to curb his
control problems.</LD>
<LD>   Nomo walked five during a 52/3-inning, three-run, six-hit
performance, bringing his season walk total to 34, second-highest in
the National League behind Colorado left-hander Mike Hampton's 35.
Nomo has given up 16 earned runs in 231/3 innings of his last four
starts, his earned-run average shooting from 2.35 to 4.00.</LD>
<LD>   But even with reluctant reliever Omar Daal sizzling out of the
bullpen--the left-hander with the Luis Tiant-like delivery entered
Saturday night's game with a 4-0 record and 1.03 ERA in 14 games and
had held opponents to a .127 average--Manager Jim Tracy said he has
not considered replacing Nomo (3-5) in the rotation with Daal.</LD>
<TE>   "Nomo pitched great early on, and we didn't score runs for him,"
Tracy said. "He's had a couple bad starts now, so do we move him to
the pen? I don't treat players like that. It's very important to give
him a window of opportunity where if things aren't going right, he's
given a chance to correct himself."</TE>
<TE>   With left-handed relievers Jesse Orosco and Terry Mulholland on
the disabled list, Tracy has to leave Daal in the bullpen for now.
Another factor, though Tracy won't discuss it: It's highly doubtful
Nomo would be an effective reliever, and not only because he's had
trouble throwing strikes, a strong deterrent to a manager wishing to
make a pitching change with runners on base.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo has been a starter his whole career and does not have a
reliever's mentality. In fact, when former Dodger manager Bill
Russell demoted the struggling Nomo to the bullpen in 1998, Nomo
asked for and received a trade.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, meanwhile, continues to excel, even though he has not backed
off his desire to be traded.</TE>
<TE>   Daal won both of the games he started in place of the injured
Kevin Brown in April and has given up only one run and four hits in
his last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   "Omar has been as valuable to our pitching staff as any guy we
have," Tracy said. "Every role he's had--starter, middle relief,
short relief, situational left-hander--he's excelled at."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An autographed bag of left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii's hair, sheared
off during a pregame haircut Saturday, will not join Arizona
outfielder Luis Gonzalez's chewing gum and Seattle reliever Jeff
Nelson's bone chips on the auction block.</TE>
<TE>   There was some thought given to auctioning the locks on EBay, with
proceeds benefiting the Dodger Dream Foundation, and Ishii said he'd
"be very happy if the money went to charity," but a team official
decided to throw the bag in the trash.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan, sidelined since Tuesday because of a
strained ribcage muscle, took some light batting practice Saturday
but was unable to play for the fifth consecutive game. With an
off-day Monday, Tracy said Jordan would probably sit out today's game
in the hopes that he'll be ready for Tuesday's game in Milwaukee.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Dodgers are 7-1 against left-handed starters, so that
should give them some confidence against Chen, the Montreal
left-hander. Ashby, who suffered a loss against the Mets despite
giving up one earned run in six innings Tuesday, is glad he won't
have to face Expo first baseman Andres Galarraga, who is on the
disabled list because of a strained lower back. Galarraga has a .419
career average (18 for 43) with five homers and 13 RBIs against
Ashby.</TE>

<KH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS/ GAME 1 REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER: LAKERS 36 SACRAMENTO 22</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: Welcome to the Cowbell Palace. Have fun storming
the castle. It's been said before and it should be noted again: Great
fans don't win games, great players do. The Lakers rose to the
challenge with their best opening quarter of the playoffs. They went
to the basket with a sense of purpose not seen since they were
dispatching the overmatched Philadelphia 76ers in last season's
final. Kobe Bryant soared above the crowd to deliver a thunderous
dunk seconds before the end of the quarter. His windmill effort gave
the Lakers a 14-point lead.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: Someone in this league who is capable of
slowing Bryant. Portland's Ruben Patterson failed. San Antonio's
Bruce Bowen failed. Now it's Doug Christie's turn to get torched.
That could change, of course. But the Kings must show a greater
desire to defend Bryant than they did in the opening quarter of this
series.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Nine of 10, the Lakers' shooting to start the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: For the Kings, it's the Lakers' 16-for-24 shooting
by quarter's end.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 10, Robert Horry 8; Kings--Mike
Bibby and Chris Webber 8.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Bryant and Horry 8; Kings--Webber,
Doug Christie and Vlade Divac 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER: LAKERS 58 SACRAMENTO 45</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Lakers seemed to be moving in slow motion,
picking apart the Kings slowly but certainly. The Kings, led by
energetic guard Bobby Jackson, made runs at the Lakers, but they
failed to trim their deficit to fewer than nine. Bryant's fallaway
and Shaquille O'Neal's drive to the hoop in the final two minutes
helped extend the Laker lead to 13 by halftime. It looked easy. The
Lakers were calm, cool and collected. The Kings were out of sync,
perhaps too emotional after a week of hearing the relentless drumbeat
of "Beat L.A!" in Sacramento. After two quarters, it appeared as if
the Kings forgot they actually have to play exceptionally well to
"Beat L.A!"</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Much of anything from O'Neal. He had three
points and one rebound in nine minutes, but he appeared to be moving
considerably better on his injured ankles and sore right big toe than
in the Lakers' five-game victory over the San Antonio Spurs in the
conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Nine points, the smallest Laker lead.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Fourteen, the points the Kings scored in the paint.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 6, Devean George 5; Kings--Bobby
Jackson 9, Webber 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry and Derek Fisher 3;
Kings--Webber 7, Divac 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER: LAKERS 82 SACRAMENTO 69</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: O'Neal made a jumper. O'Neal made a free throw.
O'Neal made a turnaround jumper. Uh-oh, the big guy is into the game
at long last, scoring at will early in the second half. The Kings had
no answer. Who does? The Kings crawled within seven points several
times, but the Lakers closed with an 8-2 run and their lead was back
to 13 by the end of the quarter. O'Neal dunked a Bryant miss and
blocked Hedo Turkoglu's shot at the other end to highlight the
closing minutes of the third. George's garbage basket completed the
Lakers' late surge.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A rival to thwart O'Neal. Divac is a clever
player with the ball, but hopelessly overmatched when it comes to
trying to defend O'Neal. San Antonio's David Robinson did about as
credible job on O'Neal as you're likely to see in the postseason.
Divac is at O'Neal's mercy.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Fourteen points on six-for-11 shooting, four
rebounds and two blocked shots, O'Neal's line.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Thirteen, the Kings' deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 14; Kings--Bibby and Christie 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, Rick Fox and George 2;
Kings--Turkoglu 5, Scot Pollard 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER: LAKERS 106 SACRAMENTO 99</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Kings cut their deficit to five points with
plenty of time to play, but Bryant made two free throws for a 102-95
lead with 59.4 seconds remaining and O'Neal swatted Bibby's
long-range jumper into the crowd with 47.2 to play. Again, it's not
about whose fans shout the loudest or dress up like it is Halloween,
but about big-time players making big-time plays. The King fans won
the screaming contest, but the Lakers won Game 1. And if the King
players and coaches don't make some adjustments before Monday's
second game, this will be a quick stay for them in the conference
finals.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A game worth mentioning from Turkoglu, who
was nothing short of brutal in attempting to fill in for injured
swingman Peja Stojakovic. Turkoglu seemed to be pressing against Fox,
trying to force the issue and making bad plays. He missed all eight
shots he took and all seemed hurried.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Three, the number of victories the Lakers need to
reach their third consecutive final.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Zero, the number of points for Turkoglu in 29
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 10, Horry 5; Kings--Jackson 10,
Webber 8.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 3, Samaki Walker 3;
Kings--Divac 5, Webber 3.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Can't Slow Preki in 2-1 Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as the Galaxy was getting sound--defender Ezra Hendrickson would
be ready to play for the first time in a month after straining his
right hamstring and midfielder Simon Elliott was making strides after
twisting his left ankle--the injury bug bit them again.</LD>
<LD>   Midfielder Sasha Victorine tweaked his back at practice on
Thursday and was unavailable for the Galaxy's game at Kansas City on
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   And while both Hendrickson and Elliott were able to play a full 90
minutes against the Wizards, it was Victorine's absence that proved
the difference in the Galaxy's 2-1 loss in front of 9,877 at
Arrowhead Stadium, a reversal of the result two weeks ago on the same
field.</LD>
<TE>   "[Last time] I thought Sasha did a good job of tying Preki up and
I think today that Preki definitely had a lot more space to play,"
Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said of the Wizards' high-scoring
midfielder. "A little bit was because of [Kansas City's] system but
also, we just didn't do a good job covering him.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Preki definitely ran havoc on us."</TE>
<TE>   Preki also scored the game-winning goal.</TE>
<TE>   In the 61st minute, Preki unleashed a wide-open left-footed shot
from the top of the penalty box that glanced off the left post before
going into the net.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy (4-2-2) scored first, in the 55th minute.</TE>
<TE>   With forward Brian Mullan on a breakaway, he was quickly marked by
Wizard defender Nick Garcia. Mullan faked to the right, losing
Garcia, and cut to the middle, just inside the penalty box. Mullan
then shot one past Kansas City goalkeeper Bo Oshoniyi.</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes later, the Wizards (2-3-2) tied the score when Diego
Gutierrez beat Hendrickson to a loose ball in front of the net.</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Moreno scored his first two goals of the season and had an
assist to lead D.C. United (3-5-1) to a 4-2 victory over New York/New
Jersey (3-5-1) in front of 20,105 at Washington.... Jeff Cunningham
had a goal and an assist to lead Columbus (3-4-1) to a 2-0 victory
over San Jose (5-3-1) in front of 15,712 at Columbus, Ohio.... Steve
Morrow scored his first two goals of the season, both on headers, to
lead Dallas (3-2-3) to a 3-1 victory over Colorado (4-3-1) in front
of 10,592 at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In WUSA games:</TE>
<TE>   Charmaine Hooper's goal in the 89th minute gave Atlanta (2-3-1) a
2-1 victory over San Jose (2-3-1) in front of 5,624 at San Jose....
Dagny Mellgren's second goal of the game, scored in the 88th minute,
lifted Boston (2-2-2) to a 2-1 victory over New York (1-4-1) in front
of 5,048 at Uniondale, N.Y.... Hege Riise scored in the 51st minute
to lift Carolina (3-0-2) into a 1-1 tie with Washington (2-3-1) in
front of 20,105 at Washington.</TE>

<HD>September Secret Earns Her Emblem</HD>
<DH>Hollywood Park: The 3-year-old daughter of sire of War
Emblem wins Railbird Stakes by four lengths as 4-5 favorite.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>War Emblem was not the first stakes winner for the sire Our Emblem on
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   About an hour before the Preakness was history, September Secret,
a 3-year-old daughter of a sire who currently commands a $4,000 stud
fee, won the $106,300 Railbird Stakes at seven furlongs as a 4-5
favorite should.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by the Lo Hi Stable and trained by Mike Machowsky, September
Secret, a $20,000 yearling purchase at Keeneland, drew away in the
final eighth of a mile to beat 5-2 second choice Affairs Of State by
four lengths in 1:224/5 .</LD>
<TE>   Ridden by Patrick Valenzuela, she won for the third time in four
starts and is perfect in two races at Hollywood Park. September
Secret had broken her maiden in her first race last June 10.</TE>
<TE>   "We had pressure applied early [by 9-2 third choice Fun House] and
outside [by 5-1 fourth choice Halo Tyra] around the turn," Valenzuela
said. "Every time [another rider] would chirp, she would just pick it
up.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought she ran a very good race even though she stayed on her
left lead throughout the stretch. She was getting to the wire all on
her own, so I never even hit her. I was really happy with her race.
She's improving every time. Her future looks very good."</TE>
<TE>   Like the winner, Affairs Of State was making her graded stakes
debut after winning her last two for trainer Bruce Headley. She
finished 21/2 lengths clear of Fun House, then came Halo Tyra and No
Turbulence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was some consolation for trainer Bobby Frankel on Saturday
at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Before Medaglia d'Oro flopped badly in the second leg of the
Triple Crown, Peu a Peu made a successful U.S. debut for Frankel,
winning the $108,700 Yerba Buena Breeders' Cup Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Last after six furlongs, the German-bred filly rallied under
jockey Russell Baze to defeat 6-5 favorite and defending champion
Janet by two lengths in a course-record 2:161/5 for the seldom-run
distance of 13/8 miles on turf.</TE>
<TE>   The old mark of 2:162/5 had been set by Golden Doc Ray, who was
also trained by Frankel, on Oct. 6, 1979.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Much to the surprise of trainer Allen Jerkens, who has pulled
quite a few major upsets, Shiny Band won the $200,000 Shuvee
Handicap, a Grade II, at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   The longest shot in the field of five at nearly 18-1, the
4-year-old Dixieland Band filly drew away from 7-5 second choice
Raging Fever in the final sixteenth of a mile to win by 23/4 lengths
in 1:344/5 for the mile.</TE>
<TE>   "Going into the race, I thought beating half the field would be an
accomplishment," Jerkens said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Niall O'Callaghan's hot streak continued when Hail The
Chief, the 2-1 favorite, rolled to a 31/4-length win over 2-1 second
choice Dollar Bill in the $500,000 Hawthorne Gold Cup in Chicago. It
was the third major stakes win for O'Callaghan in a span of a week.</TE>

<HD>Boat Tries to Survive Another Speed Bump</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Driver is on edge again today as Indianapolis
500 completes its 33-car field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>After having survived two of the most nerve-wracking "Bump Day"
experiences in Indianapolis 500 history, can it happen to Billy Boat
again?</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, Boat crashed his regular car early on "Bump Day,"
found another car and qualified it only to get bumped by Lyn St.
James at 5:34 p.m. A.J. Foyt, an old friend from U.S. Auto Club days,
offered Boat one of his cars, but it had not had a single lap on the
track and time was running out.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Drinan appeared to be the final qualifier when he took to the
track at 5:56, but when his car stalled and wouldn't start, Boat was
next in line in Foyt's car. It was 5:59 and during Boat's first lap
the gun went off signifying the end of qualifying.</LD>
<TE>   Boat's four laps at 218.872 mph bumped Jack Miller and put the
Phoenix veteran in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the scenario was reversed. Instead of being the hunter,
Boat was the hunted.</TE>
<TE>   He qualified at noon on the final day at 221.528 mph and at 5:12
he was the man on the bubble. In the next 48 minutes, 12 qualifying
attempts were made by eight drivers as Boat sweat out his fate. No
one bettered his speed and he started his fifth 500.</TE>
<TE>   This year Boat isn't on the bubble yet, but he is the slowest of
the 24 qualifiers as the final round of qualifying unfolds today.
Nine more drivers must qualify before anyone is on the bubble. Once
the field of 33 cars is filled, the slowest car on the grid,
regardless of its position, can be bumped by a faster qualifier.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the quality of the cars and drivers not yet in the
race, such as two-time champion Arie Luyendyk, CART points leader
Dario Franchitti and teammate Paul Tracy, former pole-sitter Greg
Ray, Formula One veteran Johnny Herbert and 1999 Indy 500 rookie of
the year Robby McGehee, it could be another precarious position.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't feel really good until that gun goes off at 6 p.m.
tomorrow," said Boat after practice ended Saturday. "But the Curb
Records team has done everything we can to ensure our position in the
500. Obviously, [Sunday] will be a stressful, hectic day. You know,
the unexpected is what you fear."</TE>
<TE>   Cary Agajanian, one of the car's co-owners with Mike Curb and
Boat, is optimistic that the Agajanian family will again be in the
race with the No. 98 made famous by his late father, J.C. Agajanian.
That was the number carried by Troy Ruttman in 1952 and Parnelli
Jones in 1963 when they won the 500 for Agajanian.</TE>
<TE>   "Last week at this time we were quite worried," said Agajanian,
"but with the weather as cold as it is, and few of the nonqualifiers
showing much speed, I think we're safe. Ten cars would have to beat
Billy's speed for us to get bumped and I don't see that many on the
grounds."</TE>
<TE>   Boat's qualifying speed of 226.589 mph was bettered Saturday by
only three drivers, Foyt's pair of Airton Dare, 227.015, and Ray,
226.756, and Team Green's Franchitti, 226.751.</TE>
<TE>   Oriol Servia projected himself into the picture, two days after
learning that he had lost his CART ride when team owner Derrick
Walker downsized his team from two cars to one for Scott Dixon. This
reduced CART's car count to 19, one under what is considered an
acceptable number for televised races.</TE>
<TE>   Servia had several laps in the 226-mph range in Laurent Redon's Mi
Jack backup car.</TE>
<TE>   The busiest driver was McGehee, who had been recuperating from
injuries suffered on the track's opening day until given medical
clearance to resume practice Friday. He took 108 laps, his best being
224.577.</TE>
<TE>   Luyendyk chose not to run in the final full day of practice,
saving himself and his car for today's morning practice and noon
qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more important to practice Sunday morning and tune the car
to the conditions then," he said. "It seems like the wind direction
has changed every day for the last three days so I saw no value in
running and tuning the car to [Saturday's] conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Pole-sitter Bruno Junqueira also took the day off as Chip
Ganassi's Target crew worked to repair the damage done when Junqueira
tapped the wall during practice Thursday. Crew chief Mike Hull said
the car would be ready to run Thursday on carburetion day, the last
time cars are permitted on the track before next Sunday's race.</TE>

<HD>Frankel a Favorite in Murray</HD>

<LD>The Jim Murray Memorial Handicap, named for The Times' Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist, has been kind to Bobby Frankel.</LD>
<LD>   Since the inaugural turf race in 1990, the Hall of Fame trainer
has won it five times. He'll try for a sixth this afternoon with
Skipping. The Murray will be part of a pick six that has a carryover
of $479,251.97.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Juddmonte Farms, the 5-year-old Rainbow Quest horse has
never won at the Murray distance of 11/2 miles, but he did win twice
at 11/4 miles and once at 15/16 miles in France before coming to this
country.</LD>
<TE>   In his American debut a month ago at Santa Anita, he was second to
the vastly improved Special Ring at a mile and made up ground through
a quick final quarter of a mile. Kent Desormeaux again will ride
Skipping.</TE>
<TE>   The 120-pound high weight is Startac, who was third in his first
start as a 4-year-old on April 24, beaten by favored Ladies Din and
Thady Quill. Owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson and
trained by Laura De Seroux, Startac has never tried 12 furlongs, but
he won the Secretariat at 11/4 miles last summer at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the field are The Price Spirit, Our Main Man, Lasting
Tribute, Ferrari, Poker Brad, Sharbayan and Straight Flush.</TE>
<TE>   At 11/2 miles, the Murray isn't the longest race that will be run
in the country today. That honor belongs to the $50,000 Hasta La
Vista Handicap, the closing day feature at Turf Paradise, which is
run at 17/8 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: A contentious race with 12 maiden fillies and
mares kicks off the pick four at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Don Mills. The trainer clinched the training title a
long time ago at Turf Paradise. He has won at a 35% clip during a
meet that began Sept. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Paul Lebsock. The Turf Paradise-based trainer's first
40 starters this year were winless.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta keying Wallahatchie on top in the
fifth with Khumbu and Disturbingthepeace and Silvertonguefox in the
two hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/48. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $18/$263.60. Total money bet: $328.</TE>

<KH>KING NOTES</KH>
<HD>Adelman Might Start Jackson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>King Coach Rick Adelman didn't rule out replacing Hedo Turkoglu with
Bobby Jackson for Game 2 on Monday. Jackson certainly was a far more
capable replacement for injured swingman Peja Stojakovic in Game 1.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Fox smothered Turkoglu's every move, holding him--literally,
according to Turkoglu--scoreless on eight shots in 29 minutes.
Jackson darted past the Lakers for 21 points on nine-for-15 shooting
in 25 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll think about it," Adelman said of starting Jackson as part of
a three-guard setup Monday. "Bobby was terrific. He really got us
going in the second quarter and in the second half. We need
contributions from everybody. We'll go back to the drawing board and
find a better way to beat this team Monday."</LD>
<TE>   With Fox hounding him, Turkoglu seemed to be pressing. He forced
shots and was neutralized to the point that Adelman played him for
only 12 minutes in the second half of the Kings' 106-99 loss to the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, they foul me, they grab me, but I don't want to make
excuses," said Turkoglu, who was starting for Stojakovic, an All-Star
who sprained his right ankle in Game 3 of the Kings' conference
semifinal victory over the Dallas Mavericks. "I have to play through
that and help my teammates in the second game.</TE>
<TE>   "They really need me and I didn't make any shots. I played a bad
first game, but I have to keep my head up. I wasn't nervous. I was
feeling good at home before the game. I learn from this. I have to go
to the hole and get fouls and create something for my teammates. I
had a bad game. All the other guys did a good job. Something was
missing. It was me. They were really missing me. I have to do better
in the next game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Stojakovic out for at least the first two games of the
conference finals and perhaps longer, the one thing that concerned
Adelman going into Game 1 was foul trouble. The Kings got into it in
the second half, with Doug Christie, Vlade Divac and Chris Webber
each picking up his fifth foul in the fourth quarter. Christie fouled
out with 13.8 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Divac, on the Kings' 36-22 deficit and the Lakers' 16-for-24
(66.7%) shooting in the first quarter: "We played bad in the first
quarter. Or they played excellent. However you want to look at it.
This game wasn't fun. I didn't have fun. Obviously, we put ourselves
in a big situation in the first quarter. I am not really happy with
the tempo of the game at the beginning. In the second, third and
fourth quarters, we played well. But we didn't have the energy to
finish up."</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The checklist, on the day he played a season-high 42 minutes, took 12
shots, got eight rebounds and had four steals:</LD>
<LD>   Robert Horry pointed to his mouth, his jaw, and his thigh, all
places that would require attention, starting with a trip down the
hall to the ice machine.</LD>
<LD>   "That's about it tonight," said Horry, who hadn't played as many
minutes in at least two years. "I kind of had my face in the wrong
place at the wrong time.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything's feeling pretty good. I'm just going to go back to
the room, get naked and put some ice on everything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After two series, the Lakers were still waiting for Devean
George's offense to join the postseason, and on Saturday he scored
nine points in 12 minutes off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   George, who appeared to have a breakthrough during the regular
season, when his numbers began to catch up to his athletic ability,
shot 39% from the floor and 14.3% from the arc in eight previous
playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   George was suffering from sore ankles, but Coach Phil Jackson used
him against King forward Hedo Turkoglu, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it takes a great deal of concentration sometimes,
and focus, to be able to figure a game out," Jackson said. "Right
now, he's playing half a game. He's playing good defensively for us,
but offensively he's not there yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect to get something out of him this playoffs. The last
one, the Spurs did a good job and he didn't respond."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A lot of the trash-talking before the series was attributed to
Rick Fox, who had the gumption to predict a Laker victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to back up what we said to begin with," he said. "If
you know what I said, you know I said we'd win the series. But,
that's only one game. We have a lot to finish."</TE>

<TE>   Norm Pattiz, the radio mogul and longtime Laker courtside fan
whose devotion has earned him a championship ring, missed his first
playoff game in recent memory Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Pattiz was in New York receiving the Freedom of Speech Award from
the National Assn. of Talk Radio. Although the award was given to
Pattiz for his work in creating an Arabic language radio network that
airs Voice of America broadcasts throughout the Middle East, it also
could have been given to him for his constant cheerleading. He's the
white-haired guy who stands and bangs his program at Staples Center
while sitting a couple of seats down from Laker Coach Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them the only way I would accept the award is if they set
up some televisions near the podium so I could watch the game during
breaks in the ceremony," Pattiz said.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS LAKERS 106, SACRAMENTO 99</KH>
<HD>Quiet on Western Front</HD>
<DH>Game 1: Lakers lead from start to finish, silencing Kings
and their cowbell-clanging crowd to seize home-court advantage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>At the end of a game the Sacramento Kings never led, at the end of a
day this town was sure would help alter the course of NBA basketball
forever, nothing had changed at all.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, twice-defending champions, twice at the expense of the
Kings along the way, were 106-99 winners Saturday afternoon in the
opening game of the Western Conference finals at Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant scored 30 points, 10 in the fourth quarter, and
Shaquille O'Neal scored 26, 14 in the third, and the Lakers rode a
36-point first quarter to the final seconds, when the loudest noise
was work boots on arena stairs. Game 2 is Monday night.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew my guys were going to be ready," O'Neal said. "[The Kings]
asked for us. We're here."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who had home-court advantage in the best-of-seven
series based on their regular-season record, lost six months of work
when the Lakers made nine consecutive shots early in the first
quarter. The Kings were not outscored in any of the final three
quarters, but never had another critical possession, never had a shot
that could have drawn them even, and certainly never had another
chance to win, even in the arena they believed would save them.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we've got them by the throat a little bit," Laker Coach
Phil Jackson said. "We knew how important this game was for us, and
for them."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won their 12th consecutive road playoff game--a league
record that pulled them through six previous series, including one
here last season--and their 24th playoff game in 26.</TE>
<TE>   The home-court advantage the Kings believed would be the
difference this season? The four home games--if they needed
them--that would rid them and the NBA of the Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   Gone.</TE>
<TE>   Gone when Bryant shook Doug Christie at the elbow in the fourth
quarter and made a turn-around jump shot that brought back all of the
doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "He always looks the same to me," Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman
said. "He kicks our tails every time we play them.... There's nothing
he can't do."</TE>
<TE>   Gone as early as the third quarter, when O'Neal followed a Bryant
miss with a hard, loud dunk, raced to the other end, blocked Hedo
Turkoglu's floater into the third row, and then took a rebound on
Turkoglu's next miss. He stopped shooting after that.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing really fazes us," O'Neal said. "If we do what we're
supposed to do, we're going to have a game like that."</TE>
<TE>   Unbowed by a Game 1 away from Staples Center, the Lakers were
dynamic and largely unemotional. O'Neal seemed to play from beneath
his large brow, his head tilted slightly forward. Bryant played
without expression, until the end, when he grinned at the Kings'
pleas for fairer officiating.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really been looking forward to getting back to this point,"
Bryant said. "We have been playing all season just to get here. So to
get here is kind of a relief. The challenge of playing Sacramento and
not having home-court advantage, and then our execution improving
steadily ... feels great."</TE>
<TE>   It showed in the way Rick Fox dogged Turkoglu, Peja Stojakovic's
replacement at small forward. Turkoglu missed all eight of his shots
and did not score. Stojakovic, who has a sprained ankle, is expected
to sit out at least one more game.</TE>
<TE>   It showed in Robert Horry's quest to become the third scorer for
whom Jackson had asked. He scored 18 points and took eight rebounds,
despite several hard falls and at least one rake across the mouth and
his braces, which drew blood.</TE>
<TE>   While King forward Chris Webber scored 28 points and took 14
rebounds, most of them over and around Horry, he operated mostly from
15 to 18 feet, which was the Laker strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd, the incredible noise, was not a factor. The people here
stood occasionally when it looked as though the Kings were in the
game, or about to be in the game. But they sat, even when Webber
begged them to stand and cheer, and even when Bobby Jackson, who
scored 21 points, tumbled into the stands and was kissed on the head
by two female fans.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it was too late. Stifled by the San Antonio Spurs in the
last round and sluggish against the Portland Trail Blazers in the
first series, the Lakers scored more than in any playoff game since
Game 5 of last season's NBA Finals--another road victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We take a lot of pride in our streak [of road wins]," Fox said.
"We recognize that when we win on the road, we have a good chance of
winning the series.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams will settle for a split, but we have a goal to win both
games on the road."</TE>
<TE>   The smoke had not yet cleared from the Kings' elaborate pregame
ceremony and the Lakers led, 13-4, and then 24-14 and then 31-18 and
finally 36-22, their highest-scoring quarter of the playoffs. They
had 11 assists on 16 field goals.</TE>
<TE>   They crashed into the middle of the Kings' soft interior. Every
dribble took the Lakers closer to the rim, and the quarter featured
no fewer than three Bryant dunks--two tomahawk jobs, one two-handed
alley-oop--and eight points from Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how this could have happened, Adelman raised his eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said. "I wish I knew. I guess I better find out
by Monday."</TE>

<HD>For Whom Cowbells Toll: Kings Search for Answers</HD>
<DH>Western Conference: For the first time in the postseason,
Lakers look like two-time defending champions, much to the dismay of
Sacramento and its 17,317 fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Anyone looking for a good buy on 2,000 cowbells?</LD>
<LD>   Or, "Oh, them again."</LD>
<LD>   The game the Sacramento Kings had to win to hold home-court
advantage, to show the world--and themselves--they could slay the
giant, the one they waited for all season, was effectively settled in
12 minutes Saturday, by which time the Lakers were 14 points ahead.</LD>
<TE>   After that, it was more like a game but not enough like one for
the Kings, who lost, 106-99, and reclaimed their old role: Hello,
little darkhorses.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," said Coach Rick Adelman, asked if his players had
been nervous. "I wish I knew. Guess I'd better find out by Monday
[when they play Game 2].... You could say maybe it was nerves for us
or maybe we were too pumped up, but they looked pretty pumped up and
they were doing the job."</TE>
<TE>   Nerves?</TE>
<TE>   There's one we hadn't heard in a while. Everyone at this level
gets nervous. The Boston Celtics' Bill Russell was known for being
ill before every game, on his way to 11 titles in 13 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Try this:</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers played their A game Saturday (or, as Kobe Bryant put
it, "Thank God, we played a good first quarter"), after having gone
weeks, or months, without such a display of force. The Kings aren't
good enough to beat them when they do that, nor is anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Nerves, bad defense, a rare showing for the Laker role players who
shot the lights out, bad calls....</TE>
<TE>   The Kings ran them all out, but the fact is, they've lost six of
their last seven at home to the Lakers, while going 72-13 against
everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had won seven of eight postseason games with a minimum
of domination, trailing in the second half of four of their five home
games.</TE>
<TE>   But they're never better than when they're playing one of the few
teams they actually fear a little, like the San Antonio Spurs or the
Kings, in hostile surroundings, like the Alamodome or Arco Arena,
filled as it was Saturday with 17,317 semi-civilized, redneck,
pompom-waving, cowbell-clanging fans.</TE>
<TE>   And so the Lakers came out again Saturday and pounced on the
Kings, like a lion on a hamburger.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher missed the first shot. The Lakers' next nine went in.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of those shots are shots you want them to take, not
involving No. 8 [Kobe Bryant] and No. 34 [Shaquille O'Neal].... I
haven't seen them shoot that well in a long time, as far as the other
players are concerned," the Kings' Chris Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, that's true, but that's what happens when a team gets hot,
the confidence becomes contagious.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, O'Neal made three of those shots, which was a good sign
for the Lakers. Phil Jackson said beforehand O'Neal had been "feeling
his way, more than I've ever seen him feel his way, early in games,"
but in this one, Shaq was ready from the get-go.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are certainly better than they have ever been, but so is
Bryant, which makes it hard to close the gap.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, he always looks the same to me," Adelman said. "Because
he kicks our tails every time we play 'em.... There's nothing he
can't do and he's got that killer instinct."</TE>
<TE>   The game turned into catch-up, the Kings couldn't and now they
don't have as much air in their balloon as they used to.</TE>
<TE>   The fans spent the second half booing the referees and trading
conspiracy theories. You knew lead official Dick Bavetta couldn't do
anything right when he stopped the game to have a wet spot mopped up
and was booed for that, too.</TE>
<TE>   The fans also booed Robert Horry when he left the game after
getting hit in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it reflected the overall officiating, but replays
suggested the referees blew two calls against the Kings (Doug
Christie picking up a foul for getting elbowed in the nose by Bryant,
Vlade Divac taking what should have been a charge on Horry, since he
was outside the circle under the hoop). So if the Kings and/or their
fans feel like going that way, they can cry until the cowbells come
home.</TE>
<TE>   "Seems like the schedule of this series is the same," said
Adelman, getting ready for his next last stand. "They've got to win
four. So if they beat us once, it's not over.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they're a very good road team. I mean, they've beaten us
here.... I think we woke them up a couple years ago [in the 2000
playoffs] with a couple wins here. Since then, they've been very
difficult on us."</TE>
<TE>   Very difficult?</TE>
<TE>   They ought to paint a sign on the side of the Lakers' bus: "Dreams
crushed here."</TE>

<LD>Horses stretching out from 350 yards and others shortening from 870
yards are among those competing in tonight's main event at Los
Alamitos, the $15,000 Scott Lewis Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   A field of 10 will run the 550-yard race, which is the eighth of a
nine-race card.</LD>
<LD>   Weeps, a 3-year-old filly, is the likely favorite on the strength
of her March 22 victory in the Mission Viejo Handicap.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive victory at 550 yards for Weeps.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders include War And Remebrancen, Pops Special Magic
and the Double Bar S Ranch-owned entry of Fly Home First and
Youcancallmefly.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth, a 41/2-furlong race for $2,000 thoroughbreds, could be
the best betting race.</TE>
<TE>   Feathered Friend has 15 victories and Everybody Knows has nine,
The Dancer has won 11 times, Chapie has 17 victories, Rex Royal has
seven and Star's Wild is a nine-time winner.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Fabulous Rhythm. 2. Vagabondia. 3. Im A Pritzi Boy.
4. Elmsford. 5. Kid Charismatic. 6. Rex Royal. 7. Classic Hat Trick.
8. Weeps. 9. Hugo Rules.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Fabulous Rhythm and Beda Believe It in the first, single
Vagabondia in the second, use Im A Pritzi Boy, Buzzin On By, Oh Beda
and Loves To Dash in the third and Elmsford, Brite Cat and Ang 'N'
Cyn in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Salty Toast is a firster from a good barn
(Donna McArthur) debuting in a soft spot in the fifth. Chapie has had
some trouble in his last two and is a threat off his best in the
sixth.</TE>

<LD>It's no surprise that one of trainer Donna McArthur's three entries
in Saturday's $361,000 Kindergarten Futurity took home the $151,620
purse. But It was a surprise that Morning Snow, a 9-2 choice, was the
horse that sent her to the winner's circle. The two-year old filly
made up a good deal of ground late in the race to finish in 15.47
seconds in the 300-yard race.</LD>
<LD>   Another of McArthur's pupils, 6-5 favorite Lonely Moon Sign,
finished second in 15.52 seconds. The two-year old colt had the
fastest qualifying time of 15.44 and broke well, but couldn't
overcome Morning Snow's late surge.</LD>
<LD>   McArthur's third entry of Style N Grace finished sixth in 15.68.</LD>
<TE>   With Saturday's win, Morning Snow is eligible for the Los Alamitos
Bonanza, which offers a $1-million bonus if a horse wins the
Kindergarten Futurity, the Ed Burke Futurity and the Los Alamitos
Million.</TE>

<HD>Once Again, Clippers Play the Lottery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It cannot accurately be reported that the Clippers have no shot at
winning the jackpot in the NBA's draft lottery today in Secaucus,
N.J.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, there is a 0.6% chance that they could move from 12th
place to first. They also have a 0.71% chance of advancing to the
second slot and a 0.87% chance of moving to the third position.</LD>
<LD>   What's more, the Clippers have a shot at gaining the Atlanta
Hawks' pick, giving them two in the top 13. Atlanta, currently with
the eighth pick, will fork over their pick to the Clippers if the
Hawks do not move into the top three spots. The deal was part of the
trade that sent Lorenzen Wright to the Hawks on Aug. 8, 1999.</LD>
<TE>   The lottery will determine the order of the first 13 picks of the
June 26 draft in New York. By virtue of their 39-43 record, their
best in almost a decade, the Clippers were 12th out of 13 teams that
did not make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Or to put it another way, they had the second-best record of any
team that failed to advance to the postseason. Among the
nonqualifiers, only the Milwaukee Bucks, who were 41-41, were better
than the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bulls and Golden State Warriors have the best shots at
securing the No. 1 pick, which means they each have 22.5% odds of
gaining the opportunity of perhaps selecting Yao Ming, a 7-foot-5
center.</TE>
<TE>   The Memphis Grizzlies, Denver Nuggets and Houston Rockets round
out the top five teams with the best chances of moving to No.1.</TE>
<TE>   Moving up is a distinct possibility for some teams. Last season,
for instance, the Washington Wizards moved from third to first in the
lottery and selected Kwame Brown.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers went from eighth to second, selecting Tyson Chandler
from Compton Dominguez High, then traded his rights to the Bulls for
power forward Elton Brand. They also went from third to first in
1998, taking Michael Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Clippers also have dropped several spots in the past,
falling from first to third (and selecting Darius Miles) in 2000.
They also dropped from second to fourth in 1999, when they drafted
Lamar Odom.</TE>

<HD>It's Clear Webber Needs to Do More</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK MAJERUS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this Laker opening victory, the statistics of Sacramento's Chris
Webber were like one of those Brazilian thong bikinis: They conceal
as much as they reveal.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, his numbers were impressive. But they were also a little like
what the Texans say about the cattle business--all hat and no money.</LD>
<LD>   It's easy to coach from a Lazyboy, and I'm about to do my best
work ever from that position for the rest of the Lakers' playoff
season.</LD>
<TE>   Webber's a great player, but you almost have to be better than
great--maybe superhuman--to beat the Lakers when they are playing the
way they did Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   I'll give you two instances of where Webber fell down on the job,
one a specific and one a bit more technical.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the Kings were making a run. They had cut the lead
to about seven points and had gotten the crowd back into it. Then
Webber drove, tried to dish off and was called for an offensive foul.</TE>
<TE>   What he did in that instance was complicate winning by trying a
tricky pass, when merely a functional one would have done the job. I
think it was at that moment that TV commentator Bill Walton said,
"Never let the show get in the way of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Now, for the technical stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how often the Kings went to their two-man game, to the
left side of the free-throw line, Mike Bibby and Webber. Well, the
Lakers run a defensive alignment off that called "Blue." What "Blue"
does is force Bibby left toward the baseline, where the switch draws
the big man off Webber and over to him. That's what you are seeing
when Derek Fisher jumps to the top of the pick. His body position
forces Bibby left. Bibby then does his job by getting the ball
immediately back to Webber, for the mismatch. And it was off that
play that Webber got the bulk of his points by stopping and popping.
So, on the surface, that looks like excellent strategy, but bear with
me.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings needed to do more off that play, and part of the
reason--maybe the main reason--is that it leaves Shaquille O'Neal
uninvolved, untested, free of fouls and rested. The Kings need to
test Shaq at all times, make him play more. They need to do what the
Utah Jazz do. Mix it up more. Go ahead and let Webber pop sometimes,
but also take it to the basket off that, or, quite often, run it
again, repick and start over.</TE>
<TE>   Not once all game did the Kings repick, and all that time, Shaq is
underneath, secure, resting, unchallenged and in great rebounding
position should Webber or Bibby miss.</TE>
<TE>   Other observations:</TE>
<TE>   * The Lakers love to swing the ball around the key to set up their
attack, and so it looked as if Sacramento came out determined not to
allow that. So what did the Lakers do when that was taken away? They
ran all sorts of cuts, back-door plays and lobs.</TE>
<TE>   * The Lakers may use the 24-second clock better than any team
ever. They run a mid-tempo attack. If they see an early opportunity
and it is in rhythm, they'll take a shot. If not, they swing it out
and stretch you out. The Kings? They play speedball.</TE>
<TE>   * Shaq got too many catches near the basket. If that continues,
the Kings can't win.</TE>
<TE>   * The Kings fell into a simplistic rhythm, and the Lakers are too
good, too smart, too veteran for that. You do that and they just
adjust.</TE>
<TE>   * The Kings complained to the referees too much. Too much crabbing
and too many facial expressions. Sure, they got some bad calls, but
you have to play through that. The Lakers, they just shut up and
played.</TE>
<TE>   And you saw the result.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Majerus, Utah basketball coach, will be The Times' guest
analyst on the Lakers for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the
fourth-winningest active coach in major college basketball, will
begin his 14th season at Utah this fall. Among his coaching jobs was
a one-year stint as an assistant with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1986-87,
working with Don Nelson and Del Harris. Among his former players now
in the pros are Michael Doleac and Andre Miller of the Cleveland
Cavaliers and Keith Van Horn of the New Jersey Nets. Majerus will
donate his honorarium for this column to two charities: Padua Village
group homes in Claremont, and the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt
Lake City.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Is Ready for Anything</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Team's early return flight from World Cup upsets
fans. AC Milan is opponent today at Coliseum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The message is the World Cup, and what Mexico plans to do with it,
and over the last few days, that message has been jumbled.</LD>
<LD>   "The ultimate goal," Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre said Thursday
night in San Francisco, "is to do better than all the Mexican teams
have done in the past World Cups."</LD>
<LD>   Aguirre was talking about reaching the semifinals--with a team
that had just struggled far more than necessary to defeat a squad of
young Bolivian prospects and projects, 1-0.</LD>
<TE>   "Si Se Puede!" is the official Mexican team slogan and marketing
catch phrase as the team prepares for first-round competition against
Italy, Croatia and Ecuador. Spectators at today's 2 p.m. Mexico-AC
Milan match at the Coliseum will see the words on T-shirts and other
souvenir merchandise sold throughout the stadium. They will also hear
them during a sort of halftime pep rally, designed to send the team
off for Asia in rousing fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "Si Se Puede!"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we can."</TE>
<TE>   But just in case we can't, we have booked a flight back to Mexico
on June 15, two days after the team has concluded its first-round
matches.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican Football Federation's release of the team's World Cup
travel itinerary this week caused an uproar among Mexican soccer
fans, who believe the federation was showing little faith in the
team's prospects in Japan by booking such an early trip home.</TE>
<TE>   The federation was forced to backpedal Friday. Spokesman Armando
Aceves told Reuters, "At a World Cup, you have to have all the
reservations ready because all the flights and hotels are full.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't mean to say that the team is going to return on the
15th. It's simply a question of planning, which is done by all
teams."</TE>
<TE>   Aceves said that the travel plans, originally posted on the
federation's Web site, would be removed to placate fans.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that the fans are upset, and to help put the people
at ease, we are going to remove it, because they are saying we have
no confidence in the team."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Aguirre and his team attempt to take the appeasement a step
further in their final North American match before flying Monday to
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has been less than impressive during its recent run of
warmup matches, with Aguirre tinkering with his lineup, experimenting
with players while not wanting to reveal too much to Croatia,
Mexico's opponent in its June 3 opener.</TE>
<TE>   Only late in the second half Thursday, after Aguirre had sent in
five substitutes, did Mexico play with the squad most likely to be on
the field against Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   Two of them, forwards Cuauhtemoc Blanco and Francisco Palencia,
created the only goal of the match. In the 47th minute, two minutes
after entering the game, Blanco's pass set up Palencia for a 17-yard
strike inside the left post.</TE>
<TE>   "Some players satisfied me, some didn't," Aguirre said. "Up front,
I think we lack a little imagination right now. But I think we're
very organized in the back."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday at Giants Stadium, AC Milan played to a 1-1 draw with
the MetroStars.</TE>

<HD>Newman Endures at The Winston</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Newman survived everything thrown at him Saturday night to
become the second rookie to win NASCAR's All-Star race.</LD>
<LD>   Newman endured a qualifying race, two elimination rounds, a helmet
being thrown at him, two restarts and a furious battle with Dale
Earnhardt Jr. to win The Winston--dubbed "Survival of the Fastest"
this year--at Concord, N.C., and earn the $750,000 grand prize.</LD>
<LD>   "Man, I had to drive the wheels off of it to win this thing,"
Newman said. "It's pretty cool."</LD>
<TE>   Newman, 24, joined Earnhardt as the only rookies to win the event,
and Michael Waltrip as the only drivers to take the title after
making it into the field through the qualifying race.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt, the 2000 winner, finished second and Matt Kenseth was
third, followed by Kurt Busch and rookie Jimmie Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, locked in a battle with Newman for rookie-of-the-year
honors, won the first two segments of the event and earned $100,000
in bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Newman had to win a qualifying race to make the field at Lowe's
Motor Speedway. Then he survived two rounds of cuts under the new
format and shrugged off Elliott Sadler throwing his helmet at his car
in an earlier round.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't done yet.</TE>
<TE>   Newman started the 20-lap shootout in fourth place and wasted no
time running down leader Tony Stewart, passing him in Turn 4 three
laps into it. He had opened up a three-second lead on the field and
was on his way to victory when caution came out on Lap 84 when Kurt
Busch spun out Robby Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   It bunched the field with five laps to go. Newman got a tremendous
jump on the restart, but NASCAR waved it off and made him come back
and try it again.</TE>
<TE>   So he had to do it again, duplicating the start and again pulling
away to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt could have won the race by spinning Newman out, but
backed off, allowing Newman to win the race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita's Ben Walker kept his racing season alive by going
wire to wire in the 75-lap Jani-King Super Late Model series feature
race in front of 5,842 at Irwindale Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who had said early in the season that his racing team
needs to finish no lower than third, easily held off Nathan Wulff and
Brandon Loverock for his second win of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Burns won the 75-lap Southern California Auto Club Late Model
feature race after an accident between Mike Price and Tim Huddleston
knocked out Price and sent Huddleston to the back of the pack with
seven laps left.</TE>
<TE>   David Hartsock won the 50-lap Mechanix Wear Speed Truck feature
race and Guy Tripp won the 30-lap Modified 4's feature race.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Yao Probably Couldn't Fix Knicks' Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now for the event New York has been waiting, the big fix, er,
lottery!</LD>
<LD>   At the first one in 1984, the Knicks, then, as now, in desperate
straits, stuck in their thumb and pulled out the plum of the draft,
Georgetown's Patrick Ewing.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since, the NBA has been rife with the inevitable conspiracy
rumors, among them the famous "cold envelope theory," which holds
that Commissioner David Stern felt around for the Knicks'
refrigerated one.</LD>
<TE>   The likelihood of pulling off something that smooth and keeping it
secret was nil, but the Knicks seem to think Stern will somehow
arrange it today too, dropping China's 7-foot-5 Yao Ming in their
lap.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he isn't amused by it all, but today, for the first time,
Stern will let three press people witness the actual draw.</TE>
<TE>   The New York media has been going wild about Yao's arrival, even
though the Knicks, who turned it up at the end when they should have
been shutting it down, finished No. 23, ahead of six teams.</TE>
<TE>   Now they have a 4.4% chance at the first pick and a 5% chance at
the second, which might be high enough, since either the Chicago
Bulls or Golden State Warriors would probably take Duke's Jay (nee
Jason) Williams.</TE>
<TE>   This raises another question: What were the Knicks doing at the
end of the season?</TE>
<TE>   In a three-way tie for No. 23 in March, they closed 7-13 to the
Cleveland Cavaliers' 6-14 and the Houston Rockets' 5-15.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Knicks dropped those two places in the standings, their
chances would have doubled to 9% for the first pick and 10% for the
second.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred by probability, Scott Layden, heeding the ever-shrill
demand placed on all Knick general managers to do something, flew to
China to scout Yao personally.</TE>
<TE>   When Yao journeyed to Chicago to work out, the Knicks got a
private session beforehand. Layden, Coach Don Chaney, Allan Houston
and 10 more Knick executives flew in, gave Yao a physical, put him
through a drill and took him to dinner that night.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Memphis' Jerry West asked for a private workout, was
turned down and did a slow burn.</TE>
<TE>   Then Layden lobbied the league to scratch his former coach, Jeff
Van Gundy, who was supposed to run Yao's workout for the other teams.
Layden said it was "just a matter that we didn't feel it was
appropriate at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever that meant. Anyway, Van Gundy was replaced by P.J.
Carlesimo.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the New York papers ran reams of copy, detailing the
Chinese government's desire for Yao to play in a city with a large
Chinese-American population.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, doesn't New York have a large Chinese population?</TE>
<TE>   "Yao Ming doesn't belong to any team," said Shanghai Shark General
Manager Lin Yao Min. "He belongs to the world."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, no one talked to anyone in the Chinese government, just
some basketball functionaries. The government may well conclude, as
Stern has, that as long as Yao plays in the NBA--and gets on TV--it
will work for China.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Stern seem to be putting any fix in, noting that Arvydas
Sabonis, a bigger international star than Yao, did fine in Portland,
which had no Little Vilnius.</TE>
<TE>   General suspicions to the contrary, Stern knows it's the
medium--TV--that's all-important now, rather than any market, however
huge and close to home.</TE>
<TE>   He actually rigged things against Pat Riley's Knicks, enacting
anti-thug rules, which had the effect of protecting the telegenic
Michael Jordan from Riley's "game of force."</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Stern relax rules for the Knicks. In 1997, when they led
Miami, 3-2, in the second round, he rocked them with a welter of
suspensions, one for Ewing for wandering a few feet off the bench
during a fight, after which the Heat won.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, you can get Chinese food in any hamlet in America.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Stern wanted to put Yao in New York or Golden State, he'd
face the wrath of the other teams, like West's Grizzlies, who have
guards and forwards, but no center, and still seem Yao's likeliest
destination.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely think there's a couple of markets they'd like for
him to go to," West said. "There's no question. But for a team in
this league, if you feel like he's the best player then draft him....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think teams should be blackmailed.... If he's available,
and that's who we wanted to draft, we would draft him."</TE>
<TE>   West, asked in Chicago to compare Yao to his other greats, like
Shaquille O'Neal and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, noted bluntly, "He's not
any of those guys."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Yao is 7-5, and the best center in the draft.</TE>
<TE>   There's a wide spectrum of opinions, from "looks like the real
deal" to "a freak of nature who doesn't react to game situations."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, it's impossible to reproduce NBA conditions before
the draft, and they didn't even run a scrimmage in Chicago. Yao shot
well from the outside, which means little. Guards can do that. If a
big man can't hold his ground in the lane (see: Shawn Bradley),
what's the point of being big?</TE>
<TE>   "Yao will be better than Shaquille O'Neal," declared Lin.
"Especially now in the free throw. If they bet steak for free throws,
Shaquille will owe Ming every time."</TE>
<TE>   That shows how much they know about what they're getting into.</TE>
<TE>   Yao is a huge young man with a nice touch, but he isn't used to
the faster, rougher NBA game. Everyone was hoping he'd be the next
coming of Shaq, but he's not. He's a super-project who could hit big,
or miss.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, it probably won't be in New York, which will be
a break for Yao, even if he has a few million fewer homies to hang
with. Picture the treatment he'd get next December if he were
averaging 20 minutes and eight points.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, they don't use envelopes anymore. Of course, Spike Lee
probably had a box of Ping-Pong balls on ice Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Guess who's coming to dinner: Dallas' madcap owner, Mark Cuban,
had been expected to try a trade for Yao, but it turns out the center
he wants is the Clippers' Michael Olowokandi. "I don't think Yao Ming
is as good as Shawn Bradley right now," Cuban said, ending
speculation about a Michael Finley-Raef LaFrentz offer. "Finley for
Yao Ming is the dumbest thing I've ever heard." ... Cuban also told
the Fort Worth Star Telegram he would talk to Bill Duffy,
Olowokandi's agent. Said assistant coach Donnie Nelson of Olowokandi:
"That's certainly a center with a very solid body. He'll give us
another international guy so he'll fit right in." ... Olowokandi is,
of course, only a restricted free agent, and the Mavericks are over
the cap, meaning the Clippers would have to OK a sign-and-trade,
which has no shot. On the other hand, if my favorite Clipper owner
thinks he's going to escape at $6 million a year, as he reportedly
told a season-ticket holder, he'd better think again. More Europeans
on the horizon: Three or four are expected to be drafted in the first
round, and the San Antonio Spurs hope to sign Emanuel Ginobli, a
6-foot-5 Argentine guard playing in Italy. Ginobli, who was just
chosen most valuable player of the European Final Four, was San
Antonio's second-round pick in 1999. The Pistons hope to sign Mehmet
Okur, a 6-11 Turk they selected in the 2001 second round. Team
President Joe Dumars says if Okur were in this draft, he'd be the
second- or third-best power forward.</TE>
<TE>   Oops: Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik admitted what everyone knew,
telling ESPN the league would be "very uncomfortable" with a final
series in lame-duck Charlotte. This, of course, resulted in
paranoids- delight reviews of every call against the Hornets, such as
Baron Davis' three-point shot that was waved off at the end of Game 4
in Orlando (the Hornets won in overtime), and Jamaal Magloire's
suspension for Game 1 against the New Jersey Nets (the Hornets lost.)
Coach Paul Silas, in a classy response: "The way I feel about it is
this: Blaming referees is for losers. Anytime you use referees as an
excuse, you're a loser."</TE>
<TE>   The rebuilding continues: The Bulls fired longtime PA announcer
Ray Clay, known for his bombastic ("A-A-A-N-D NOW ... FROM NORTH
CAR-O-LINA") Michael Jordan introduction. A spokesman said they
wanted to go in "a different direction." Clay said he was fired for
telling the press he was told to give a downbeat intro when Jordan
returned last season as a Wizard.... The Knicks' Latrell Sprewell, on
a length-of-the-court pass the Nets' Jason Kidd rolled to Lucious
Harris for a layup against them this season: "Jason even bowled a
pass to a guy. He put a curve on it, right to the guy. I'm looking at
guys, like, 'Did you see that?'"</TE>

<DH>Eastern Conference: Either the Celtics or Nets will go from
missing the playoffs to the NBA Finals in one season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Celtics and New Jersey Nets are the unlikeliest of Eastern
Conference finalists, teams that did not qualify for the NBA playoffs
last season, but are one series victory away from playing for the
championship. It will be the first time since 1978 that a team that
missed the playoffs the previous season advanced to the finals the
next.</LD>
<LD>   Not that anyone is bothering to pay much attention, what with the
Lakers and Sacramento Kings squaring off in the marquee matchup out
West, but the Celtics and Nets figure to put on an intriguing show in
the East.</LD>
<LD>   The Celtics' Paul Pierce has already issued a challenge that
rocketed down Interstate 95 from Boston, over the George Washington
Bridge onto the Jersey Turnpike to Exit 16W.</LD>
<TE>   "There are certain teams in the NBA that you match up against
well," Pierce said several days ago. "New Jersey is one of those
teams. I don't think they have anyone that can really defend me."</TE>
<TE>   Having averaged 37 points in four games this season against the
Nets, Pierce might be right. We'll find out for certain starting
today at 2:30 PDT, when the best-of-seven series begins at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets seemed to agree with Pierce, a standout at Inglewood High
who averaged 26.1 points during the regular season. Or at the very
least, they acknowledged their inability to halt him this season.
After all, Pierce scored 46 of his career-best 48 points in the
second half plus overtime of Boston's victory Dec. 1 over the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody on this team that can stop Paul Pierce one on
one," said New Jersey Coach Byron Scott, a former Laker guard who
also hails from Inglewood. "As good a defensive player as Kenyon
[Martin] is, Paul is going to score. Same thing with Antoine
[Walker]. Obviously, we have to limit those guys from having big
nights."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said he won't double-team Pierce, but will probably have
Martin (with help from Kerry Kittles and perhaps Jason Kidd) on the
Celtic swingman. In fact, one of the troubling aspects of facing the
Celtics is determining how to best defend a team that defies
convention.</TE>
<TE>   Boston often eschews an inside game in favor of three-point
shooting from Pierce and Walker, who at 6-feet-6 and 6-9,
respectively, are big enough to play down low, but are more
comfortable on the perimeter. Pierce made 21 of 28 three-point shots
in the four regular-season games against the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Walker averaged 22.1 points during the regular season, but only
one other Celtic, Rodney Rogers (11.9), averaged in double figures.
Pierce, Walker, Rogers, Tony Delk and Erick Strickland are all
three-point threats.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, bolstered by the acquisition of Kidd last summer from
the Phoenix Suns, completed a monstrous turnaround in 2001-02. They
were 26-52 last season, but improved to 52-30 and earned home-court
advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics finished three games behind the Atlantic Division
champion Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Kidd's wizardry with the ball and the presence of
Martin, a 6-9 power forward with an edgy side to his game, and 7-foot
center Todd MacCulloch in the middle, the Nets are considered to be a
more well-rounded team than the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be exciting," Kidd said last week. "Both teams like to
explore and get easy baskets when the situations present themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd hasn't been slowed despite a gash over his right eye he
sustained during a collision with David Wesley of Charlotte in Game 3
of the Nets' conference semifinal series.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets might also have another advantage in Scott's dislike for
Boston, dating to his days as a Laker facing the Larry Bird-led
Celtics of the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, Scott attempted to break up a scuffle between
his team and the Celtics only to have Walker scream at him. Later,
Scott said Walker "hasn't done anything in this league," and couldn't
tell him what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel the same way I did about them when I played," Scott
said of the Celtics. "It hasn't changed that much. That green and
white doesn't sit well with me."</TE>

<HD>Hat Trick by McCarty Lifts Wings</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Role player steals spotlight with his first
three-goal game in 5-3 victory over the Avalanche.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>On a team bursting at the seams with stars, a grinder stole the show.</LD>
<LD>   Darren McCarty scored three goals, all in the third period, as the
Detroit Red Wings beat the Colorado Avalanche, 5-3, Saturday in Game
1 of the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess when you only score five during the regular season and
haven't scored any in the playoffs, you're due," McCarty said before
dozens of reporters in a conference room. "I've always heard about
this room, I've just never been it. It's nice. Thanks for having me."</LD>
<TE>   McCarty's only other career hat trick didn't really count because
it came in an exhibition game against the Toronto Maple Leafs two
years ago. He's never scored more than three goals in one postseason,
or 20 goals in a regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his numbers, Hockeytown will always adore the winger for
his charisma and his series-winning goal in the finals of the 1997
Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   McCarty's rugged style provides a needed contrast on a team full
of stars.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the 10 or 11 Hall of Fame guys that get it done each
night, but when they don't get it done, we have different guys to
step up," McCarty said. "Tonight was my night. It's about time, but
it's one game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll cherish this for a couple days."</TE>
<TE>   McCarty's teammates may joke about his day in the spotlight
longer, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a better chance of winning the lottery than he does of
getting a hat trick," Red Wing captain Steve Yzerman said.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which has won nine of its last 10 games, will play host
to the defending Stanley Cup champion Avalanche again in Game 2 on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings don't think they will face a shaken team.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't get rattled," McCarty said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarty put the Red Wings ahead, 3-2--giving them their first
lead--early in the third. He provided a two-goal cushion midway
through the period, then padded the lead with 4:05 left. He was
promptly showered with hats.</TE>
<TE>   Red Wing goaltender Dominik Hasek, who is 5-0 in his last five
games at home, stopped 24 shots. Patrick Roy made 25 saves in the
much-anticipated meeting between two of the game's best goalies.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado got off to a good start despite being pushed to seven
games by San Jose in the conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit had a week to rest after eliminating St. Louis in five.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Joe Sakic and Milan Hejduk gave the Avalanche 1-0 and
2-1 leads in the first and second periods, but Detroit's Tomas
Holmstrom and Brett Hull each answered with a goal toward the end of
each period to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   McCarty's go-ahead goal was scored just above Roy's glove on a
wrist shot from between the circles.</TE>
<TE>   "That first goal got the crowd going, got the Wings going,"
Colorado Coach Bob Hartley said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the fifth time these Western Conference powers have met in
the playoffs since 1996.</TE>

<HD>Vizcaino Keeps Astros Rolling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Houston Astro Manager Jimy Williams expects a lot from Jose Vizcaino,
and the utility player has come through with clutch hits in two of
the last three games.</LD>
<LD>   Vizcaino hit a game-ending home run with one out in the bottom of
the ninth inning to lift the Astros over the Pittsburgh Pirates, 2-1,
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The victory was Houston's seventh in a row, the club's longest
winning streak in three seasons. The Astros won a club-record 12 in a
row in September 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "[Vizcaino is] always prepared. We always get the best out of him
every time he plays, his best at-bats, his best fielding, his best
everything. He's the ultimate pro," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Vizcaino, who has started 12 games this season, hit a two-run
single in the eighth inning Thursday night to put the Astros ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really that hard to come off the bench," Vizcaino said.
"I've been playing that way for four years and I'm always mentally
prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Vizcaino hit his first homer since June 15 and his second since
June 4, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, Philadelphia 4--Junior Spivey homered in the bottom of
the ninth inning, and Erubiel Durazo hit his fourth home run in two
games.</TE>
<TE>   Spivey's drive to left field against Jose Mesa (1-3) was estimated
at 461 feet, the fourth-longest in the five-year history of Bank One
Ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Curt Schilling, trying to become the season's first nine-game
winner, struck out 12 in eight innings but was lifted for a
pinch-hitter with one out in the eighth and the score tied, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, San Diego 2--Roberto Alomar hit a two-run homer in a
four-run first inning at San Diego, and the Mets won their fifth in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Estes (2-4) gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings
to improve to 11-4 in his career against the Padres. He was struck
twice by balls hit up the middle.</TE>
<TE>   David Weathers and Scott Strickland each worked a scoreless inning
of relief, and Armando Benitez pitched a perfect ninth for his eighth
save in as many chances.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 7, Atlanta 3--Denny Stark made his second strong start
for Colorado and hit a two-run homer at Denver for his first career
hit.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Ortiz had four hits and Bobby Estalella drove in three runs,
helping Colorado win for the eighth time in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Stark (2-0), called up Monday from triple-A Colorado Springs, gave
up one run and four hits, and struck out five in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Millwood (2-5) hit his second career homer, but continued to
struggle on the mound. He gave up seven runs--five earned--and seven
hits in four innings for his fourth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 7, St. Louis 3--Juan Encarnacion hit a two-run homer at
St. Louis and the Reds ended the Cardinals' five-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Rijo (4-1) gave up two runs in five innings for the Reds, who
lead the NL Central and the Cardinals by five games.</TE>
<TE>   Encarnacion's homer ended 17 consecutive scoreless innings by Matt
Morris (6-3).</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 3, Chicago 1--Jose Cabrera (2-4) pitched five scoreless
innings at Milwaukee in his second career start, and the Brewers
handed Chicago its ninth loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa batted with two men on base in the seventh inning but
struck out on four pitches against reliever Luis Vizcaino.</TE>

<HD>Giants' Bonds Makes Splashy Move</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Slugger hits two home runs into McCovey Cove and
has 582, one shy of McGwire on all-time list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds keeps moving up the career home run list, and even his
opponents are in awe.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds homered twice to move within one of Mark McGwire for fifth
place on the all-time list, leading the San Francisco Giants past the
Florida Marlins, 10-5, Saturday afternoon at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds went three for three with two walks. The home runs gave him
582 in his career.</LD>
<TE>   "He has more power than anyone in the game right now," Florida's
Eric Owens said. "Even with the wind blowing in at 50 mph, those
balls are still going out as hard as he hit them."</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker left the dugout and was helped to the
clubhouse in the eighth inning after feeling dizzy. Tests showed he
was slightly dehydrated.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to do with baseball, not getting enough sleep and a little
stress," Giant trainer Stan Conte said. "He just felt a little dizzy.
Five minutes after we got him to the clubhouse he was fine."</TE>
<TE>   Conte said the spell was unrelated to Baker's surgery in December
for prostate cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fine," Baker said 45 minutes after the game. "I'm not dizzy
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit a two-run drive against Brad Penny (3-3) in the second
inning and a bases-empty homer against Vic Darensbourg in the sixth
to give him 15 homers this season, tying Lance Berkman and Sammy Sosa
for the major league lead. Both home runs landed in McCovey Cove.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds has 59 multihomer games, fifth on the career list.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I've ever seen anybody as locked in as he is,"
Marlin Manager Jeff Torborg said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was in a hurry to watch the Laker-Sacramento King playoff
game, and didn't stick around long afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "We played great the last two days," he said, "but I've been a
Lakers' fan from Day 1, so I want to go watch the game."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Rueter (6-1) won his sixth consecutive decision. He gave up
three runs, walked two and struck out two in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry was awesome," Rueter said. "He came through big-time for
me. I don't think I've ever seen two splash hits in the same game."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin shortstop Alex Gonzalez left the game because of a
dislocated left shoulder. He was injured when he went after a single
by Bonds in the third inning, diving for the grounder and landed
awkwardly on the outfield grass. He was taken from the field on a
cart.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Fighting for the first time since stopping Zab Judah to win the
undisputed 140-pound title, Kostya Tszyu put on a boxing exhibition
on his way to a 12-round decision over Ben Tackie to retain his three
titles.</LD>
<LD>   Tszyu (29-1-1) took few chances, content to jab and pile up round
after round on the judges' scorecards.</LD>
<LD>   Tszyu won every round on two of the scorecards, 120-108, and was
ahead 119-109 on the third.</LD>
<TE>   Tackie (24-3) never was in serious trouble as Tszyu made the first
defense of his International Boxing Federation, World Boxing Council
and World Boxing Assn. 140-pound titles.</TE>

<HD>Magic Moment Has Arrived, so Start Planning the Parade</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>During each of their first two long drives toward the NBA
championship, there has been a moment when the Lakers stopped
sputtering, stopped swerving, stopped wondering.</LD>
<LD>   There has been a moment when a tired and dusty team looked down
and realized its tank was full enough and its tires were strong
enough.</LD>
<LD>   It has been at this moment when the Lakers have rolled down the
windows, stuck their arms outside, and sped toward the title shouting
something that resembled "Whoo-hoo!"</LD>
<TE>   Sort of like Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That clanging heard at the Arco barn wasn't cowbells, it was
escort sirens.</TE>
<TE>   That dull roar coming from stunned farmers wasn't booing, it was
the start of a motorcade.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' 106-99 victory over the Sacramento Kings in Game 1 of
the Western Conference finals wasn't only a game, it was a letter of
confirmation for a trip to the middle of June.</TE>
<TE>   An occasional stall notwithstanding, can the Lakers be headed
anywhere else?</TE>
<TE>   The only team that can beat them couldn't. The only place that can
faze them didn't. The only ones who can stop them now, it seems, are
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Three years, three defining moments, perhaps none so alternately
blaring and silent as this one.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of Saturday's game, the crowd of 17,317 set the
alleged world record for the loudest crowd. It was so loud, pens
rattled on press tables and Laker coaches tightened ear plugs.</TE>
<TE>   But six minutes into the first quarter, after the Lakers had made
nine of their first 10 shots, it was quiet enough to hear a Vlade
Divac flop.</TE>
<TE>   In the final minute, the loudest noise was the trudging of fans
leaving early to beat the traffic.</TE>
<TE>   What's the Guinness world record for the loudest collective whine?</TE>
<TE>   "We took what we wanted," Samaki Walker said. "We didn't just take
what they gave us."</TE>
<TE>   And in doing so, the Lakers claimed the sort of affirmation that
serves in these lengthy playoff situations as fuel.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't a championship team in the first round against
Portland. They were barely a conference finals teams in the second
round against San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, with each impossible shot by Kobe Bryant, with each
improbable dive or slap by Rick Fox and Robert Horry, with each
same-old-unstoppable layup by Shaquille O'Neal, their self-image
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Casualness became capitol punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "In each round we've played better, but not good enough to win
this kind of game," said Fox, sweating more under the postgame lights
than while running through a matador King defense. "Today, we did. It
was only a matter of time before we had one of those games that
lights us up down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Remember Game 7 against Portland two years ago?</TE>
<TE>   Remember Game 2 in San Antonio last year?</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's was a direct descendant, even if it didn't quite
resemble them during the early afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   While walking from the team bus, Phil Jackson tripped and fell
just outside the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   A security guard helped break his fall, even if Jackson didn't see
it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "He tripped me," Jackson said with a smile. "It's already
started."</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher missed a jump shot on the Lakers' first possession
and Divac moved inside for a layup and ... botched it.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, O'Neal scored on a jump hook. Fisher made a jump
shot. Bryant made a jump shot. Fox made a three-point shot. O'Neal
made another jump hook. O'Neal dunked. Bryant dunked.</TE>
<TE>   All while the Kings were taking bad shots, with no passes, while
playing no defense.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher made a jump shot. Fox made a jump shot. Fisher made a
three-point shot.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway into the first quarter, in a game that was supposed to
knock them cold, they were dancing around while leading by 10.</TE>
<TE>   It was that quick, that clean, that over.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a freedom to our game," Jackson said. "They looked like
they played a little tense."</TE>
<TE>   A freedom to pass, with 11 assists in the first quarter alone.</TE>
<TE>   A freedom to bump and run on defense, with Fox muscling Hedo
Turkoglu into a misprint-looking game of zero points in 29 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   A freedom to share the wealth, with a different player starring in
each quarter, from Horry to Devean George to O'Neal to you-know-who.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been playing all season long just to get here," Bryant
said.</TE>
<TE>   And they remember it well.</TE>

<HD>Legitimate Triple Threat</HD>
<DH>Preakness: War Emblem wins by three-quarters of a length to
move within a victory of Triple Crown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>That so-called one-dimensional colt who won the Kentucky Derby a
couple of weeks ago showed his opposition some new looks at chilly
Pimlico on Saturday. War Emblem sat off the lead instead of making
it, spurted away after he felt Victor Espinoza's whip for the first
time and, by winning the Preakness, gives trainer Bob Baffert his
third shot at the Triple Crown in six years.</LD>
<LD>   Affirmed was the 11th and most recent Triple Crown winner, in
1978, and since then no trainer other than Baffert has won the first
two legs in the series more than once. War Emblem will try to take
the 49-year-old former quarter horse trainer where Silver Charm and
Real Quiet couldn't. After winning the Derby and the Preakness, both
horses finished second in the Belmont Stakes, Silver Charm losing to
Touch Gold in 1997 and Real Quiet getting outrun at the wire against
Victory Gallop in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The Belmont, at 11/2 miles the longest of the three races, will be
run in New York on June 8. War Emblem will be running for a
$1-million purse with the rest of the horses but can earn a
$5-million Triple Crown bonus for completing the sweep.</LD>
<TE>   "Our chances are very good," Baffert said. "If I can keep him like
he is, he can do it."</TE>
<TE>   In the Derby, War Emblem set an uncontested pace, and his win at
Churchill Downs was derided in some circles even though he ran the
ninth-fastest Derby. This time, before a crowd of 101,138 on a cool,
overcast day, it was Menacing Dennis, a 51-1 shot, who made the lead.
Espinoza had a stranglehold on War Emblem going down the backstretch.
They were never more than a length from the front, and when he cut
the colt loose, on the far turn, the race appeared to be over.</TE>
<TE>   But another longshot, the 45-1 Magic Weisner, came out of the
crowd to battle War Emblem to the wire. Over a drying-out track that
was called fast, the margin after 13/16 miles was three-quarters of a
length. After brisk opening fractions of :46 and 1:103/5, the final
time of 1:561/5 was the slowest for a Preakness winner since Tabasco
Cat's 1:562/5 in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "At the eighth pole," Baffert said, "I started saying to myself,
'Where's the wire?' That's an awfully long stretch."</TE>
<TE>   This was Baffert's fourth Preakness win, and starting with Silver
Charm, he has won eight of the last 17 Triple Crown races. Last year,
Baffert finished fifth with the Derby favorite, Point Given, who
rebounded to win the Preakness and the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   Point Given was bred and owned by Ahmed Salman, the Saudi Arabian
prince and international publisher who bought War Emblem as a
pre-packaged horse for $900,000 on April 11, five days after he won
the Illinois Derby. Chicagoan Russell Reineman, who kept a 10%
interest in War Emblem, had consigned him to a yearling auction in
2000, buying him back for $20,000 when the bidding stalled.
Saturday's win, War Emblem's sixth in nine starts, was worth $650,000
and increased his earnings to $2.8 million. The total includes a
$1-million Sportsman's Park bonus for winning the Illinois Derby and
at least one Triple Crown race. Reineman, the owner of the horse for
the Illinois Derby, has said that he will sue Sportsman's Park,
claiming that he deserves half of the bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Magic Weisner, who didn't run in the Derby and is expected to skip
the Belmont, finished three-quarters of a length ahead of Proud
Citizen, who was third in the Derby. Then came Harlan's Holiday,
Easyfromthegitgo, U S S Tinosa, Crimson Hero, Medaglia d'Oro,
Straight Gin, Menacing Dennis, Table Limit, Booklet and Equality.
Straight Gin was pulled up by his jockey, Robby Albarado, after the
race and suffered a career-ending injury to his left foreleg.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, who went off the favorite, paid $7.60 to win. The $2
exacta on War Emblem and Magic Weisner was worth $327, and a $2
trifecta on the first three finishers returned $2,311.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest disappointment was Medaglia d'Oro, who was the
morning-line favorite but ran eighth as the 3-1 second choice.
Medaglia d'Oro, handicappers theorized, would move up off his
troubled fourth-place finish in the Derby, but Saturday he stayed
close to the pace for a half-mile before folding.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in a perfect spot early, but the horse just backed up,"
said Bobby Frankel, who trains Medaglia d'Oro. "I saw enough the
first time watching the race, I'm not going to watch a replay. I was
scared of War Emblem from the start. My horse is going to New York
[Saturday night]. I'll give him a month or so off, then try the
turf."</TE>
<TE>   Another bomber was Booklet, who was expected to challenge War
Emblem early if Baffert's colt attempted a rerun of his Derby
sprint-off. After running in fourth place for about six furlongs,
Booklet faded to 12th.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Smith, aboard Wayne Lukas-trained Proud Citizen, had hoped
for a better trip.</TE>
<TE>   "There were two things that really cost me," Smith said. "At the
break, I got off a step to the side, and that cost me a half-length.
Then I was hoping Booklet would keep War Emblem inside, but instead
he pushed me seven-wide around the turn."</TE>
<TE>   Lukas finished 11th with his other horse, Table Limit. Lukas
wasn't certain if either horse would try the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   As he did with Silver Charm and Real Quiet, Baffert will ship War
Emblem back to his barn at Churchill Downs today, then fly the horse
to New York a few days before the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   "Racing needs a Triple Crown winner," Baffert said, then turning
to Salman he asked the 43-year-old Saudi if he was having fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," the prince said. "And I'm losing weight, too."</TE>

<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>A year ago, the first time he ever rode in the Belmont Stakes, Victor
Espinoza was a distant second to Point Given with A P Valentine.</LD>
<LD>   Point Given was trained by Bob Baffert, but in three weeks,
Espinoza will have Baffert on his side. He'll be riding War Emblem,
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, on a day when he's in a
position to earn $560,000 with a Belmont win. That would be the
jockey's 10% share of the $600,000 winning purse and the $5-million
Triple Crown bonus.</LD>
<LD>   Espinoza, who'll be 30 on Thursday, will rattle those numbers
around later. "It's Bob's job to get the horse ready for the next
one," Espinoza said after winning his first Preakness. "I just want
to take some time and enjoy this."</LD>
<TE>   Espinoza's first Preakness resulted in a sixth-place finish with
the longshot Hugh Hefner in 2000. Last year, when Baffert pulled him
off Congaree after a third-place finish in the Kentucky Derby,
Espinoza picked up the mount on A P Valentine and finished second to
Point Given here.</TE>
<TE>   "This horse is getting better and better," said Espinoza of War
Emblem, whom he rode for the first time in the Derby. He never hit
War Emblem with his whip at Churchill Downs, but on Saturday at
Pimlico he went to his stick 10 times with the right hand as the
near-black colt fought off Proud Citizen and then Magic Weisner in
the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   "When I broke from the gate, I got bumped a little," Espinoza
said. "But I wasn't worried about that. I just focused on my horse.
When the other horse [Menacing Dennis] took the lead, my horse got
really aggressive. He wanted nobody to take his position. He wanted
to be in control of everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert gave Espinoza the mount on War Emblem after the colt was
bought 23 days before the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Victor not to use the whip in the Derby, but he was on his
own this time," Baffert said. "When he hit him, the horse re-broke.
Victor's got this horse figured out now."</TE>
<TE>   Magic Weisner, who almost caught War Emblem in the last sixteenth
of a mile, had never run in a graded stake before the Preakness. The
Maryland-bred gelding, who's owned and trained by Nancy Alberts, had
won six of 10 starts going in and was being ridden by Richard
Migliore for the first time. At 45-1, second longest shot on the
board, Magic Weisner was beaten by three-quarters of a length.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had told me this morning that I'd finish second in the
Preakness, I'd have signed the papers," Migliore said. "But now I'm
kind of disappointed, because we came so close. This horse is like a
barroom brawler, and you can never count him out. I was really just
hoping to get a check [finish in the first four]. At the head of the
stretch, I was ecstatic, thinking I might get third. But then I
thought I had a shot at second, and then I thought we were really
going to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey, aboard Medaglia d'Oro, knew early that this wasn't
going to be his colt's day.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to run through a gap halfway down the backside," Bailey
said. "But I didn't have enough horse to make it. You don't get a
very good feeling when that happens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other stakes at Pimlico, Snow Ridge, ridden by Mike Smith, won
the $100,000 Maryland Breeders' Cup Handicap by 73/4 lengths; Strut
The Stage outfinished Del Mar Show in the $200,000 Citgo Dixie;
Tenpins won the $100,000 William Donald Schaefer Handicap; True
Direction win the $100,000 Hirsch Jacobs Stakes; Chris McCarron was
aboard Quidnaskra for her win in the $125,000 Gallorette Handicap; Mr
O'Brien won the $100,000 Woodlawn; and Sarava was best in the
$100,000 Sir Barton.</TE>

<LD>Talk of winning a Southern Section title is usually confined to the
gymnasium at Compton Dominguez High, but this spring the boys' track
and field team began making its own predictions. At the Division II
finals Saturday at Cerritos College, the Dons won the first section
title for the school's track program, finalizing a plan that was
hatched in early March.</LD>
<LD>   "We had our eyes on winning the championship early on," said
senior Justin Wyatt, who was part of the winning 1,600 relay team.
"Since the first week of practice we've been talking about it."</LD>
<LD>   Lionel Larry, a sophomore at Dominguez, won the 100 and 200 meters
and ran a leg on the winning 400 and 1,600 relay teams. Craig Woods
had the other victory for the Dons, winning the 110 high hurdles in
14.67.</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly won the Division I title for the second
consecutive season and fourth in five years. The Jackrabbits, who
outscored runner-up Arroyo Grande, 79-34, won the 400 relay in a
state-leading 40.78 and the 1,600 relay in 3:14.37. Poly's Armand
Goodin won the 110 hurdles in 14.36 and Derrick Jones won the 200 in
21.24, upsetting Matt Bruno of Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills (21.32).</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, runner-up in Division III the last two
seasons, finally won the team title. Gardena Serra won Division IV,
its sixth title in the last seven years and seventh in nine.</TE>
<TE>   Noah Bryant of Carpinteria broke his own Division IV record in the
shotput with a mark of 66-1/2, which bettered his state-leading mark
of 65-11 and is fifth-best in the nation this year.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Burgess of Edwards Air Force Base Desert broke the Division
IV record in the long jump with a mark of 23-10 and Kyle Hammerquist,
a sophomore at Claremont Webb, broke the Division IV record in the
discus with a throw of 178-2.</TE>
<TE>   The two state leaders in the long jump, seniors Chris McFoy of
Chino and Ronald Hill of Walnut, went head to head in Division I.
Hill won with a state-leading mark of 24-41/2, sixth-best in the
nation. McFoy was second at 23-51/4.</TE>

<LD>Chaunte Howard of Riverside J.W. North High split her time between
the high jump and long jump for a short period during the Southern
Section divisional track and field championships at Cerritos College
on Saturday, but it didn't seem to affect her performances.</LD>
<LD>   Howard, the defending state champion in the high jump, won the
Division I title in that event with a divisional record of 6 feet and
won the long jump with a career-best 20-41/2. She also placed first
in the triple jump at 40-5 to pace North to a second-place finish
behind Long Beach Poly.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to put down some good marks today," Howard said. "I
wanted to get my confidence back up."</LD>
<TE>   Howard, who has signed with Georgia Tech, spent a short portion of
the meet running from an attempt in the high jump to an attempt in
the long jump and back to the high jump.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually I'm competing in the high jump and triple jump at the
same time," Howard said. "The triple jump takes a lot of energy out
of your legs so today was easier than usual."</TE>
<TE>   Howard was one of four individuals who posted state- or
nation-leading marks in the girls' meet.</TE>
<TE>   The others were senior Chelsea Johnson of Atascadero, who won the
Division III pole vault with a nation-leading 13-6, junior Allyson
Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist, who won the Division IV 200 meters
with a nation-leading 22.99, and senior Tunisia Johnson of Long Beach
Poly, who won the Division I 300 low hurdles in a state-leading
42.38.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's 13-6 vault topped her previous best by two inches, moved
her to second on the all-time national high school list behind the
13-8 set by Shayla Balentine of Morro Bay last year and came about 15
minutes after she ran a career-best 14.68 to place second in the 100
high hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, defending state champion in the 100, won her third
consecutive Division IV titles in the 100 and 200. She also anchored
the Knights, who won their first section girls' title, to a winning
time of 47.88 in the 400 relay and to a second-place time of 4:01.52
in the 1,600 relay with a scorching 51.47-second leg.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly, led by double individual champions Shalonda
Solomon and Johnson, won its second consecutive Division I title with
a record 129-point total. Solomon, a sophomore, anchored the winning
relay teams, including a nation-leading 45.32 in the 400. Johnson won
the 100 high hurdles in 14.18 in addition to her victory in the 300
hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Angel Perkins led Cerritos Gahr to its second consecutive
Division II title by winning her second consecutive titles in the
100, 200 and 400 and anchoring the Gladiators' winning 400 relay
team.</TE>

<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>It is so cool to be a Carolina Hurricane fan. It doesn't matter if a
Carolina Hurricane fan knows what a blue line is or the rules of
icing or that the Toronto Maple Leafs have won 13 Stanley Cups. What
matters is that the Hurricanes are hot. The Hurricanes are winners,
are in the NHL conference finals, are selling standing-room-only
tickets for today's Game 2 against the Maple Leafs for $110.</LD>
<LD>   "This is so neat," Tad Speitzer said Saturday. Speitzer stood
outside the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena waiting to buy his
ticket. "I never stand for anything," said the 28-year-old sales
representative and lifelong Duke fan. "I wouldn't pay to stand in
Cameron Indoor, but there's something about this hockey stuff. It's
gotten in my blood."</LD>
<LD>   It is so not cool to be a Charlotte Hornet fan.</LD>
<TE>   Dial up the number for the Hornets and a recording says: "Thank
you for calling the Charlotte Sting." The Sting is a WNBA team. The
Hornets are all gone, packing up and moving to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The good news: There is a hot and happening pro sports team in the
state. The bad news: It's a hockey team. The good news: There is
still a professional basketball team in the state. The bad news: It's
a women's team.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Hurricane fever is a trend or a fad in North Carolina, it
is too soon to tell.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when the Hornets were all the rage. A famous
fashion designer created a look that soon became the hottest-selling
gear in the NBA. The Hornets had a big, new building. The fan base
was supposed to be savvy, consumed with following only the very best
of college basketball--North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, North
Carolina State. For a period of nine years the Hornets had 364
consecutive sellouts. From 1990-91 through 1996-97, they led the NBA
in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   There should have been this wonderful synergy. These people who
loved basketball so much would be able to follow favorite players
from high school through college and into the NBA. The fans would
come not only from Charlotte but from Tobacco Road and South Carolina
too. It would be a regional team and the region was passionate about
two things--basketball and auto racing.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's auto racing and hockey. When NBA Commissioner David Stern
announced the official demise of the Hornets he said, "This is an
extraordinary disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   Some Charlotte fans say the NBA should pay attention. "What
happened to the Hornets is something to be careful about," said Audie
Blakely.</TE>
<TE>   Blakely said he attended 10 to 15 Hornet games a year, driving
three hours each way from Raleigh because he loves basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I was all into the Hornets for a while but I got sick of all the
bad stuff," Blakely said. "Who wants to root for a team where the
owner is a jerk and the players were in trouble all the time? That's
what I like about the Hurricanes. I don't claim I'm some hockey
expert. But I like how hard the guys play and how they mostly just
seem like nice guys."</TE>
<TE>   Blakely said he knows lots of Hornet fans who grew disgusted with
too many scandalous stories. A popular player, Bobby Phills, was
killed in an auto accident that police said happened during a drag
race with teammate David Wesley.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy owner George Shinn, a self-proclaimed Christian who
demanded his employees wear white shirts and ties and who was shrill
in his demands that the city buy him a newer, better arena, found
himself accused of sexually assaulting a female staff member whose
husband eventually committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "Who wants to root for guys like that?" Blakely asked.</TE>
<TE>   If it seems the ascendance of the Hurricanes and the descent of
the Hornets were both sudden and in synchronicity, it hasn't exactly
been that way.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes came to Carolina five years ago, a team rejected by
Hartford, where they had been called the Whalers and had been pretty
anonymous. Upon arrival, the new Hurricanes found out life could be
worse than being in Hartford. They were homeless, playing games for
two years in Greensboro while a new arena was built. For the players
who chose to live in what would be their eventual city, it was a
160-mile round-trip commute to home games.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance was dismal in Greensboro. "And let's face it,"
Hurricane captain Ron Francis said, "why would you buy tickets to see
a team that wasn't yours in a sport you didn't know much about?"</TE>
<TE>   But if paying fans in Greensboro were scarce, the eventual home
team fans were watching cautiously but with growing interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes weren't awful. Last year, when they took New
Jersey, the defending Stanley Cup champion, to six games in the
playoffs, the way the team played with heart and with total effort
won the affections of these Tobacco Road residents.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what's cool?" Speitzer said. "You have all these people
divided between rooting for Duke, North Carolina and North Carolina
State in this little area and we can all get together on this thing.
Everybody is rooting for the Hurricanes."</TE>
<TE>   Hurricane Coach Paul Maurice says it has been fun watching the
locals warm to the ice team. "They may not know all the rules and
nuances," Maurice said, "but they seem to understand how hard this
team plays and how much fun the game can be."</TE>
<TE>   After the Hurricanes eliminated Montreal in the second round of
the playoffs, the team arrived home in the middle of the night and
found 500 rooters waiting for the plane. "That was kind of beyond the
call of duty," Francis said, "but it meant something."</TE>
<TE>   As good as things seem now, it is worth noting that the Hurricanes
have sold out only 23 regular-season games here. There were some
empty seats in Thursday's Game 1 loss to Toronto. Those 18,853 seats
will all be filled today.</TE>
<TE>   But next year or the next or the year after that?</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing lasts forever," Blakely said. "I'd tell the Hurricanes
not to get greedy and don't take this all for granted. Because the
fans can turn on you. Just ask the Hornets."</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>You've probably heard a lot about the fervor of Sacramento King fans,
the noise they make, and how Laker fans fall short.</LD>
<LD>   I came here to see for myself, and right away noticed the
difference on the drive from the airport. A "Holiday Inn" dominates
the city's skyline, so there was no missing the "Go Kings" sign atop
the building's highest floor.</LD>
<LD>   I wish we had a high-rise Holiday Inn in L.A. that dominated our
skyline.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TWO HOURS before the first game of this four-game series, I was
standing in front of Arco Arena chatting with a cow. I found him very
pleasant, and a much better interview than Kevin Brown, and I wish we
had a cow like this in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento's cow was wearing a purple afro, so I have no idea if
he had a cowlick. His right eye was painted black, his left white,
his body covered in a cow costume complete with tail, and he was
telling me his wife put a stop to him filling his rubber udder with
milk and squirting people because she feared someone might take
exception. I wish I could have introduced the cow to Kevin Brown
before his wife put the clamps on his udder.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a landscape contractor in Sacramento," Scott Anderson said,
and I guess if my job was trying to make the landscape in Sacramento
more appealing I might end up dressing like a cow one day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SACRAMENTO Convention and Visitors Bureau, excited about
having outsiders in town, passed on the following information to the
media: There were 27 automobiles registered in Sacramento County in
1905. Five years later there were 700. I would guess next year local
officials will be able to tell us there are more cars than horses on
the road for the first time in county history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SHARON AND GREG Marts were wearing matching "Beat L.A." T-shirts,
and each had an $8.99 cowbell hanging around their neck. I'm sitting
here now trying to envision a cowbell around the wife's neck, and
there's almost no way to finish this sentence without getting in
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to the local feed store and tried out all the bells until
we found a really obnoxious one," said Greg, and here in Sacramento,
I'm told a night out at the local feed store is considered a hot
date.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the closest feed store to L.A. is in Sacramento, so
I paid $10 for my own cowbell. I can't wait to try it out Monday at
the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment Commission golf tournament
at Riviera during the middle of Dwyre's back swing. By the way, I
wish you would e-mail me and tell me if you think your boss plays
more golf on regular work days than my boss. I just don't think it's
possible.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALEX WOOD stood in a line more than 75-deep waiting with King fans
to have their faces painted purple and black. He was wearing a King
jersey, and think of all the possibilities. Wrong. He had Scot
Pollard's name on his back.</TE>
<TE>   I told him he could have saved money if they were charging him by
the letter, and just put "Stiff," on his back, and everyone would
have known it was Pollard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ERNIE AND DAN Heinze, father and son, were waving homemade yellow
obscene foam fingers at anyone wearing Laker jerseys. I spotted Rob
Clark, a Laker fan from Upland, here in civilian attire so as not to
draw attention to himself.</TE>
<TE>   "You see that chicken," I told father and son, "he's a Laker fan,"
and they were off to jeer him. I think it's really nice when a father
and son do things together.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SACRAMENTO Convention and Visitors Bureau wants you to know
the movie "Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle" was filmed here. It's expected to
arrive in local Sacramento theaters for the first time next year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PHIL JACKSON called Sacramento a "cow town" two years ago, and so
that's why these people bang on bells. Picture fans entering the
arena with outstretched arms, a bell in each hand and security guards
using a wand on them to detect metal. Now there's some noise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COWBELLS ARE prohibited at Raley Field, home of Sacramento's minor
league baseball team, which is good news for the River Cats' F.P.
Santangelo, now that I have my own cowbell.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MANY OF the King fans here were wearing T-shirts that read "Feel
the Roar," and a sign over the entrance to Arco said, "Welcome to the
House of Roars." As much as the wife likes to raise her voice around
the house, I didn't need to come to Sacramento to get a headache.</TE>
<TE>   To start the game, fans were urged to set a Guinness Book of World
Record with a "powerful Arco roar," the picture of a decibel reading
of 112.6 showing on the scoreboard. It set a record, but that seems
to me to fall two decibels shy of Bill Walton's voice on NBC's
broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE KINGS had their cheerleaders outside performing before the
game, and as attractive as they were, it's obvious they were shipped
in from L.A.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KOBE BRYANT went to the "Star Wars" movie Friday night and got
into a conversation with a woman, who said she's a King fan and who
had no idea she was talking to Bryant. "I had my hat pulled down over
my eyes," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman told Bryant how the Kings were going to win, and how she
was going to have some people over for a party to watch the game and
she didn't want to jinx the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be surprised what you can do," Bryant said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIS DOESN'T come from the Sacramento Convention and Business
Bureau, but speaking from personal experience, the city's finest
restaurant is located off the I-5 at J Street. A real nice "Denny's."</TE>

<HD>Koffler Means Business Trying to Rebuild Artesia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armed with a bachelor's degree in public administration from USC and
five years' experience as a backup quarterback, Matt Koffler thought
he possessed the ideal credentials for a career in business.</LD>
<LD>   He began a training program, only to discover how much he disliked
his career choice.</LD>
<LD>   "I just didn't like upper management, customers and the people in
general," he said. "I wanted my own leeway."</LD>
<TE>   Koffler decided to reverse fields, trading his suit and tie for
shorts and a whistle.</TE>
<TE>   At 24, he was hired as football coach at Rosemead High, his alma
mater, in 1999. Three seasons later, Rosemead reached the Division
VII semifinals. Last month, Koffler accepted another challenge,
taking over as coach at Lakewood Artesia, which was 2-7 last season.</TE>
<TE>   He begins spring practice Monday, thrilled to be teaching and
coaching. He's even using some of the lessons learned from his
business classes, such as how to be a turnaround specialist and what
is required to be a motivational speaker.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy people telling me, my coaches and players that we can't
do things, that we can't win at Artesia and we're not disciplined,"
he said. "That's what drives me and motivates me."</TE>
<TE>   Artesia has lost its share of players to nearby Los Alamitos, a
Southern Section Division I power, but those days are about to end,
if Koffler has any say. He's asking his players to believe in
themselves and the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We played South Hills last year," he said. "They had five guys
sign Division I. I didn't sign anyone, and we beat them because they
believed."</TE>
<TE>   Koffler had former USC coach John Robinson write a letter of
recommendation when he was interviewing for the Artesia job. Koffler
spent five seasons, from 1992 through 1996, as a reserve USC
quarterback. He completed the longest touchdown pass play in USC
history, 97 yards, to R. Jay Soward. He also received tutoring from
offensive coordinator Mike Riley.</TE>
<TE>   "I had an experience that I think is awesome," he said. "What it
is like to run out of the tunnel five times against Notre Dame and
the heated rivalry against UCLA. [Players] can go home and tell their
parents, 'My coach played at USC,' arguably one of the best football
programs of all time."</TE>
<TE>   Except what will Koffler do when UCLA fans ask why he was 0-5
against the Bruins?</TE>
<TE>   "I just present the facts," he said. "They've won five Rose Bowls,
and we've won 20."</TE>
<TE>   The first priority for Koffler is finding a quarterback. He's
putting in a West Coast offense, similar to what he ran at Rosemead,
where his quarterback passed for more than 2,000 yards last season
with only two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm searching," he said. "It's going to take extra work on my
part."</TE>
<TE>   He'll serve as his team's offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy putting on the headphones," he said. "It's still like
playing. I get nervous. I feel the same competitiveness as the
players."</TE>
<TE>   Koffler lives in Huntington Beach with his wife, an
elementary-school teacher.</TE>
<TE>   All he's going to ask of his players is that they work hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to be very positive," he said. "I think these guys need
positive. They don't want to be yelled at every day, just like I
didn't want to be yelled at every day. I'm trying to get it in their
heads, if they work hard, good things will happen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division I finalist Huntington Beach Edison is trying to rebuild
its offense around All-Southern Section quarterback Tommy Grady. The
running game should receive a boost from transfer Andy Avila, who
played at Santa Ana Calvary Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Adding speed is Jared Balbas, who was a top skill-position player
as a freshman, quit football as a sophomore to play club soccer, but
has returned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For once, Westlake, Newbury Park or Simi Valley Royal isn't the
Marmonte League title favorite. Give the nod to Agoura, which has six
starters returning on defense and five on offense. Offensive guard
P.J. Irvin, who weighs 280 pounds, has committed to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Charlie Wegher has hired three former NFL players--Clay
Matthews, Erik Kramer and Ryan Wetnight--as assistant coaches.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, Royal senior quarterback Kyle Uebelhardt will
have the best voice in the Marmonte League. He's an opera singer with
a 4.0 GPA. He's going to Harvard for a summer quarterback camp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson is keeping quiet about
which of his talented sophomores might play varsity this fall. He had
two undefeated freshman teams.</TE>
<TE>   One sophomore who will certainly be on the varsity is quarterback
Jason Forcier, a 6-foot-2, 190-pounder who could win the starting
job.</TE>
<TE>   The best player at Mater Dei is Brandon Nicolas, a 6-3, 245-pound
junior defensive lineman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It won't be long before college recruiters start paying attention
to Granada Hills lineman Matt Streid, who is 6-1, 267 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   He started on defense as a sophomore in last year's playoff
against Carson. After a year in the weight room, he's expected to do
lots of damage to West Valley League teams.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Dickson, who rushed for 1,258 yards as a sophomore at Van
Nuys Grant last season, has enrolled at Birmingham.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Greg Vanney, the former Galaxy defender who moved to the French first
division club Bastia this year to improve his chances of making the
U.S. World Cup team, saw all hope of doing so vanish Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI exam on Vanney's right knee showed that the injury he
suffered during Thursday night's 5-0 victory over Jamaica at Giants
Stadium was more severe than first believed.</LD>
<LD>   "The results came in today and unfortunately he has a
second-degree sprain in the MCL [medial collateral ligament] and he
will not make our 23-man roster," U.S. Coach Bruce Arena said. "He
would have been our 23rd player."</LD>
<TE>   Vanney, one of 10 alternates named by Arena when he selected his
World Cup roster last month, said Friday that he felt he would be
going to Korea/Japan '02 in place of Chris Armas, who was knocked out
of the final 23 when he tore a knee ligament in a 2-1 victory over
Uruguay last Sunday in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But what was initially diagnosed as a minor sprain turned out to
be worse for Vanney.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to him this morning before he left [to return to Los
Angeles]," Arena said. "Obviously, he's disappointed. I think he
suspected yesterday when he was feeling a little sore that that was
probably the case. It's going to take him probably about six weeks to
have a full recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Under World Cup rules, all rosters have to be finalized by
Tuesday, 10 days ahead of the May 31-June 30 tournament. Arena said
he will again turn to the list of alternates.</TE>
<TE>   "Take the goalkeepers away [from the remaining nine alternates],
and there are seven candidates there," he said. "We're leaning toward
a midfielder or a defender."</TE>
<TE>   The midfielder option opens the door for Brian Maisonneuve of the
Columbus Crew, a France '98 veteran; Brian West, also of the Crew,
and D.C. United's Richie Williams, who will be 32 two days before the
U.S. plays Portugal on June 5.</TE>
<TE>   If Arena decides to add another defender, the choices are Steve
Cherundolo, the Hannover '96 (Germany) right back who started seven
of the U.S. team's 16 qualifying games, and Richard Mulrooney of the
San Jose Earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   The seven have only 53 international appearances between them, led
by Williams' 20 games for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Arena said he would contact the player selected on Saturday
evening and that it was possible he could join the team before
today's game against the Netherlands at CMGI Field.</TE>
<TE>   "That person will not play tomorrow," Arena emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, of course, will most of the top Dutch players. Coach Dick
Advocaat's original 18-man squad included such international stars as
Frank de Boer (Barcelona), Jaap Staam (Lazio), Edgar Davids
(Juventus), Pierre van Hooijdonk (Feyenoord), Patrick Kluivert
(Barcelona) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (Manchester United). Van
Nistelrooy already has withdrawn, Kluivert is rumored to be out, and
it will not be until kickoff that the makeup of the Dutch team will
be known.</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands lost only two of its 10 qualifying games but still
finished third in its group behind Portugal and Ireland and therefore
failed to qualify for the World Cup.</TE>

<HD>Nation's Energy Needs Collide With a Way of Life</HD>
<DH>Policy: Bush team's push for natural-gas drilling in
Wyoming is creating havoc with ranchers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPOTTED HORSE, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>When an energy company offered to tap the natural gas deposits locked
in the coal beds under his land, Bill West thought he had finally hit
the pay dirt his father had dreamed of since homesteading the ranch
in 1919.</LD>
<LD>   Not only would he reap royalties from the gas, but the huge
quantity of ground water pumped from the wells during production
would support his crops and livestock. "My dad said he would live
easy once he struck oil," West, 69, recalled.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, with 45 wells producing methane, life is much harder on
West's picture-postcard ranch, where antelope range with his cows and
the grassy prairie melds into jagged sienna-colored hills topped with
pine trees.</LD>
<TE>   The water turned out to be the villain.</TE>
<TE>   Two winters ago, water from thousands of upstream wells flooded
Spotted Horse Creek where it flows through West's ranch. There it
iced over and remained for months. Now the 200 or so stately
cottonwood trees that line the creek--adored in this land of few
trees--are dead.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 acres of his best hay meadows were so severely damaged
that nothing has grown on them since.</TE>
<TE>   What West and other ranchers didn't know is that while the water
extracted with the methane is safefor thirsty cows, it is so salty
that it damages the soil and kills the vegetation. The problem of
what to do with the millions of gallons a day from these wells has
emerged as the most vexing environmental challenge to the promising
source of domestic energy, state and federal officials agree.</TE>
<TE>   The natural-gas boom in northeastern Wyoming pits the nation's
thirst for energy against a way of life that ranchers have practiced
for generations in this countryside where elk and wild trout still
abound and the sky goes on forever.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has designated this region's coal-bed
methane as a key part of its goal of boosting energy production.
Because the federal government owns the majority of mineral rights,
the administration has authority to set the tone for its development
here and in downstream Montana, putting to the test President Bush's
pledge to protect the environment while increasing energy supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Early indications of the Bush administration's plans trouble many
who care about the ecology of the remote and fragile region. The
Denver office of the Environmental Protection Agency was so concerned
about the Bureau of Land Management's 10-year blueprint for
developing 51,000 wells across the Powder River Basin that it gave
the plan the worst possible rating last week for failing to protect
the region's environment, particularly its rivers. The BLM's draft
environmental impact statement calls for rapidly producing 16
trillion cubic feet of natural gas (about 80% of the nation's annual
need), a goal that will bring to the surface 4.2 million acre-feet of
ground water--naturally high in sodium in these parts--enough to
cover Connecticut and Rhode Island with a foot of water, said Paul
Beels, the BLM project manager.</TE>
<TE>   Federally held mineral rights will bring in an estimated $2.7
billion in royalties, half of which will go to the state of Wyoming,
Beels added. The state also receives royalties from mineral rights it
owns and tax revenue from each well in the basin.</TE>
<TE>   That money gives federal and state officials incentive to quickly
approve production of federal minerals, which has been stalled
pending completion of the environmental impact statement.</TE>
<TE>   But many ranchers who have long been stewards of this land accuse
the state and federal governments of approving wide-scale destruction
of the arid region's fragile soil and scarce water as they speed
ahead to reap the invisible gold.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not against drilling," said Ed Swartz, a rancher who has lost
grazing land to methane water. "I'm just against how they're doing
it. They need to do it in a responsible and environmentally sound
manner. I've worked to improve my ranch my whole life. I don't want
to lose it to methane. Nobody should have a right to destroy somebody
else's way of making a living."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the hellbent gold-rush mentality that's causing a lot of the
problems," added Jill Morrison, a rancher and organizer of the Powder
River Basin Resource Council, an environmental group with almost
1,000 members, about half of them ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   But coal-bed methane producers complain that they are already
over-regulated and reject the suggestion that they are callously
harming the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people have a bad perception of the oil and gas industry,
but we are developing the resource for the consumer," said Dru Bower,
vice president of the Petroleum Assn. of Wyoming. "The bottom line is
the resource needs to be developed--even for environmentalists and
their families."</TE>
<TE>   Some ranchers--those who have benefited financially from the
methane production and whose operations haven't been harmed by the
water--say that coal-bed methane has been a godsend that has allowed
them to quit their day jobs and return to full-time ranching.</TE>
<TE>   "People told me that the whole valley would be ruined and the
grass would be dead and we wouldn't have fields," said Joanne Tweedy,
58, whose 5,000-acre ranch, small by local standards, hosts 51
coal-bed methane wells. "That never happened. The economic boon has
been wonderful for smaller ranchers."</TE>
<TE>   But ranchers downstream from Tweedy, not to mention the Denver EPA
office, have a different perspective.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA says the BLM's approach would violate federal and state
water quality laws by making at least two rivers--the Tongue and the
Bell Forche--unsuitable for irrigation. The elevated sodium levels in
this ground water prevents the soil from percolating and chokes plant
growth when used for irrigation. The soil damage can be irreversible,
the EPA said.</TE>
<TE>   And the coal beds release a lot of water. Companies discharge it
into natural drainages or hold it in hundreds of ponds--some natural
and others built or expanded for this purpose. The Wyoming Oil and
Gas Conservation Commission says 60 million gallons are extracted a
day, enough to serve Anaheim or Riverside. And the project is only a
fraction of the size that it will be at the peak envisioned by the
BLM.</TE>
<TE>   To extract the methane, companies drill wells hundreds of feet
deep to a coal seam. Then they pump out the water that has trapped
the gas in the coal. The gas flows out to a pipeline; the water is
usually released at the surface, where it flows into drainage
channels or is pumped into ponds.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies have tried to pump the water back into the ground,
but the aquifers in the Powder River Basin do not readily receive
water, said Lance Cook, the state geologist. Also, the amount of
water is enormous. For each cubic foot of methane that is produced,
these coal beds yield about 100 times more water than coal beds in
the San Juan Basin on each side of the Colorado-New Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spraying of Water Only Hardens Soil</TE>
<TE>   Some companies are trying to spray the water into the air with
tall atomizers. But when that was tried here, West said, the soil
under the atomizers became so hard that grass couldn't grow in it.</TE>
<TE>   Some operators are not so considerate. When rancher Patricia Clark
challenged her operator over the death of her edible vegetation, the
operator took her to court. She won, but only after $45,000 in legal
fees. Now she is working with a new operator, but she will not let
any new wells be drilled until she is sure there is a workable plan
to dispose of the water without additional harm to her grazing land.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to produce," said Clark, 49, who heads the fourth
generation of her family ranching this land. "I've got minerals. I'd
like to make money, but I'd like to protect my surface so I can
continue ranching and so my kids can continue ranching."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Swartz has no wells on his land, but the 8-foot-wide bed of
Wildcat Creek that meanders 11 miles through his property carries
methane water from upstream. The creek bed used to be dry for most of
the year and provided some of the best grass on his ranch. "I grazed
that all winter," said Swartz, 61.</TE>
<TE>   Now water with high sodium content runs through it most of the
year, and cows won't eat the vegetation that grows in and around it.
"Collateral damage is what they call it in the military," Swartz
said. "I don't want to be collateral damage; I worked too doggone
hard."</TE>
<TE>   After trying for many months to get the attention of state
officials, Swartz sued the state and the methane well operator
upstream from his ranch for sending salty water his way.</TE>
<TE>   "I really love this ranch," said Swartz, whose son now does most
of the ranching while he fights the methane companies. "It's
heartbreaking that because of government policies it might not be
able to continue on in the family."</TE>
<TE>   State officials, who are committed to the development but are
aware of the unintended consequences, said irresponsible operators
who don't follow guidelines or respect landowner rights are causing
many of the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got good operators; we have bad operators. We've got happy
landowners and unhappy landowners," said Cook, the state geologist.
"We've done our best to thump heads when bad operators act out."</TE>
<TE>   The battle for the basin is also about preserving the scenic
beauty of one of the least populated areas of the country as energy
companies string 5,000 miles of new power line, build 17,000 miles of
new roads and bury 20,000 miles of new pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Dowd, who runs a money management firm in Casper, was so
captivated by this region's charms that he bought a ranch on the west
side of the Powder River Basin four years ago as a retreat for
himself and his clients.</TE>
<TE>   With spectacular views of the Big Horn Mountains, a pristine trout
stream and plentiful wildlife, it seemed the perfect getaway. He was
told that the conservation easement on the property prevented mineral
development. He was misinformed.</TE>
<TE>   A coal-bed methane company called last fall to announce it had
leased the minerals under his land and planned to start drilling.
Under state law, mineral rights trump surface rights, and Dowd is one
of many surface owners who do not own mineral rights.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very aggressive," Dowd recalled. "They said, 'We're
going to do it whether you like it or not. You better cooperate or it
will be worse for you.' "</TE>
<TE>   He has tried to limit the damage to his property by requiring the
company to bury power poles, controlling where they drill wells and
limiting the heavy truck traffic.</TE>
<TE>   He has sought to keep the methane water from flowing into Clear
Creek, which now has crystal-clear water from mountain springs. His
legal bills are mounting.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't fight them, they'll destroy the place, and if I do
fight them it will destroy me financially," Dowd said.</TE>
<TE>   He paid $3.2 million for the property and still owes $1.8 million
on it. "It's not worth that," Dowd said. "It's the single worst
mistake I've ever made in my life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Effects of Emptying Aquifers Feared</TE>
<TE>   Duane Zavadil, environmental specialist for Williams, a Tulsa,
Okla.-based energy company and the biggest producer in the basin, has
no apology for the fact that surface owners are inconvenienced by the
production of minerals they don't own.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a little bit elitist when somebody in Wyoming
doesn't want a pickup truck on his road or a nice water flow going
through his property," Zavadil said.</TE>
<TE>   In a dry place like the Powder River Basin, ranchers and
scientists worry about the long-term effects of emptying the shallow
aquifers.</TE>
<TE>   Wells have already started going dry, including the Wests' wells
for livestock and home use. Water from a new $40,000 well dug by an
energy company contains so much iron that it stains clothes and
tastes too bad to drink.</TE>
<TE>   "Wyoming is arid, and here we are throwing away hundreds of
millions of gallons of water a day to make enough methane to feed our
national gas appetite for a year," said Walter Merschat, a geologist
who consults for oil and gas companies.</TE>
<TE>   Zavadil said that 95% of the water is seeping back into the ground
and will eventually refill the aquifers.</TE>
<TE>   But West doesn't believe him. "They are so dishonest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from the energy companies laughed at West three
years ago when he expressed concern about the extracted water that
would flow through his property from hundreds of wells upstream.</TE>
<TE>   Now his cottonwoods are dead and he's left with the task of trying
to figure out what to do with the decaying trunks of the
once-graceful trees.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have many trees out here, and we liked those trees; we
thought they were really pretty," said Marge West, Bill's wife.
"Isn't that just criminal?"</TE>
