<LD>Pink and black ostrich-feather boas draped a large glass case of
sequined gowns that once adorned the curvaceous figure of Mae West.
Every corner of the room glittered with rhinestones and the
oft-quoted dame looked out from several moody portraits as her fans
perused her extravagant personal effects: real hair eyelashes, a
stuffed bird of paradise, feathered headdresses, a jeweled crown and
matching scepter. "This is real Tinseltown titillation," shouted
Johnny Grant, honorary Hollywood mayor and former neighbor to West.
"I'm probably the only man in the room who Mae West told to 'Come up
and see me sometime.' "</LD>
<LD>   As Grant spoke, the room echoed with the pop of a champagne
bottle. It was Friday morning and a small crowd had gathered at the
Hollywood History Museum in the Max Factor building to celebrate what
would have been West's 109th birthday by viewing an extensive
collection of her things. The installation of eight gowns and scores
of small items represents three decades of collecting by West's
former personal assistant, Tim Malachosky, who worked with her until
her death at age 87 in 1980. "This is just a touch of what I have,"
he said.</LD>
<TE>   For some, the glamorous display brought to mind another
strong-willed blond entertainer. "There would have been no Madonna
without this woman," actress Doris Roberts said. For others, like
former bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay, the event was nostalgic. Hargitay
was just 28 when West summoned him to her Ravenswood penthouse in the
summer of 1954. She was planning a Las Vegas comeback and wanted
Hargitay and eight other "musclemen" to back her on stage. It was a
heady experience for the young Hargitay. "She always knew who she
was," he recalled. "The center of the world was always her."</TE>
<TE>   Fresh New Children's Author</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the new hip-hop Dr. Seuss," said Doug E. Fresh. "I'm bringing
it to a new level as far as flavor goes."</TE>
<TE>   The hip-hop artist had called to talk about the expansion of his
resume--he's become a children's book author. Next month, Scholastic
will publish "Think Again," an illustrated volume that includes a
"rap-along CD," the entire package written by Fresh.</TE>
<TE>   And Scholastic's got another rapper on its children's roster: LL
Cool J, whose "And the Winner Is ... "--also a book and CD
combination--comes out Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Fresh, LL Cool J wasn't in a green eggs and ham state of
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an LL Cool J book," he said. "I wasn't thinking of Seuss."
Rather, the rapper wanted to use his celebrity "in a positive way,"
he said. The story, which is illustrated and stars LL Cool J as
himself, "teaches kids to overcome adversity."</TE>
<TE>   "The photos, the cute little bodies, the stick figures, I thought
it was cool," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The two books are the first in the "Hip Kid Hop" series, designed
to help children learn how to read. Planned are books by hip-hop
artists including Shaggy, Kevie Kev and Common, and possibly one by
Missy Elliot, said Karyn Rachtman, who came up with the idea for
combining children's books with the rap-along CDs.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1970s, Carole King had a kids' record," said Rachtman.
"There's never been hip-hop music for [young] children."</TE>
<TE>   "You have adult lyrics and you have children's' lyrics," agreed
Fresh. "Children don't have no place to hear children's lyrics. It's
like going to the amusement park. There's 'The Cyclone' but there's
no Ferris wheel. You're forcing the children to go on 'The Cyclone.'
"</TE>
<TE>   In a more prosaic vein, Fresh continued: "Hip-hop can be a tool to
learn. What they can get from these stories is that they're real. You
hear slang words, and to hear that makes it so real for the kids."</TE>
<TE>   And it's good, clean fun. "It's positive. Not negative
expletives." And not cliched or silly, Fresh said. "I tried to make a
book that's not corny but hot."</TE>
<TE>   His book describes the friendship between two children, one black,
one white.</TE>
<TE>   "The story's just sly, you know."</TE>
<TE>   A Shady Past</TE>
<TE>   A contestant on the new "Survivor" show has more of a past than
the network originally let on. A CBS bio described 34-year-old Brian
Heidik as a "top used car salesman" who also had "varying acting
credits," including appearances on "Days of Our Lives."</TE>
<TE>   What CBS failed to mention were his credits (under his stage name,
Dave Roth) for such soft-core movies as "Virgins of Sherwood Forest,"
"Passions Obsession," "Sinful Obsession," and "The Pleasure Zone,"
according to the Web site The Smoking Gun (www.thesmokinggun.com).</TE>
<TE>   A CBS spokeswoman said the network was aware of Heidik's film
history but said that the network hadn't listed every credit in his
biography.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about L.A. is that it's so boring. There's
nothing going on here, so you can actually focus; you can get stuff
done." Musician and heiress Francesca Gregorini in the new issue of W
magazine.</TE>

<LD>CALIFORNIA DREAMING</LD>
<LD>   A Smooth-Running, Low-Mileage, Best-Priced American Adventure</LD>
<LD>   By Lawrence Donegan</LD>
<TE>   Atria Books</TE>
<TE>   230 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   Scottish writer Lawrence Donegan has made his career peering
behind postcard facades and uncovering the comic,
less-than-picture-perfect reality that resides there. In "No News at
Throat Lake" he moved to a small town in rural Ireland and reported
on country life there, cattle and all. "Maybe It Should Have Been a
Three-Iron" traced the year he spent as caddy to the world's
438th-best golfer. In his newest release, "California Dreaming,"
Donegan immigrates to the land of sunshine and silicon to realize his
fantasy of being a self-made man and thereby achieve the American
dream.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since he toured the U.S. 20 years ago as a 21-year-old bass
player for the Scottish pop band the Bluebells, Donegan tells us,
he'd been enamored with American life. He'd vowed to one day return
"not as a failed musician this time but as an explorer."</TE>
<TE>   Making a pledge, though, is much easier than actually doing it.
Investigating U.S. immigration laws back in Scotland, he finds only
two possible routes: "You could live a life of such abject poverty in
a Mexican shantytown that you became desperate enough to throw
yourself at an electric fence on the Texan border .... Or you could
throw yourself at the mercy of an avaricious immigration lawyer in
New York," he writes. "Both options were out of the question."</TE>
<TE>   Just in the nick of time, an old college buddy who now owns a
successful computer chip company in Silicon Valley happens along. He
helps Donegan arrange the immigration details and provides him with a
lucrative job offer. "The starting salary for someone with your
experience--i.e., none--is sixty thousand dollars a year," he tells
Donegan, "plus twenty-five thousand shares in the company." Welcome
to the land of opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Only Donegan had been hoping for something more exciting, a job to
prove his mettle. His quandary is clarified when a used-car salesman
convinces Donegan that there is only one way to access the genuine
American dream: through sales. "When you get out of bed in the
morning, you can't bargain for your shoes, or the pants you're
wearing, or the life you're leading," the salesman explains. "But you
can come down here and haggle for a car all day long, and if you
don't like the salesman, or his price, you can walk out the door. You
know what that is? ... Undiluted capitalism--America."</TE>
<TE>   Donegan is converted. He skips the computer job and takes one at
Orchard Pre-Owned Autos, a grubby place topped with a 20-foot
inflatable Godzilla. "I suspected I wouldn't make a million in the
car business but I was utterly convinced I would discover the America
that I was looking for."</TE>
<TE>   What he finds is a comic journey of self-doubt, moral wrestling
and the payoff of indefatigability. Donegan's is a story of survival
on the asphalt jungle, and he keeps readers laughing at his foiled
strivings for America's glossy details.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed "Scotty" for his fresh-off-the-boat accent, Donegan
quickly becomes a target of ridicule as the worst car salesman ever
to work the lot. He won't give up, though, and eventually his
tenacity pays off.</TE>
<TE>   He graduates from being a "green pea," or novice salesman, when he
pursues a couple to a competing dealership.</TE>
<TE>   "Forgive me if this sounds boastful," writes the former journalist
for the Guardian in London, "but I've enjoyed a varied life. I've
played in a rock band in front of eighty thousand people ... I've
worked for the world's best newspaper ... I've birdied the 17th hole
at the Old Course .... But nothing, and I mean nothing, had ever come
close to the sense of achievement and self-worth I felt" at closing
that sale.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the America I had come to find, with Sunny slapping me
on the back and Frankie telling me I was a real car salesman now."</TE>
<TE>   But there's unease in his moral fiber. He's shocked at what he's
willing to do to sell cars and be in contention for the biggest prize
of all: being named salesman of the month. "In the world beyond the
car lot I was ... good-natured and honest ... it was only when there
was a sales contest to win that I started to behave erratically ....
In my natural state I was ... harmless ... but pin a name tag to my
tie, then set me loose among 250 used cars, and I became dangerously
unstable."</TE>
<TE>   Donegan's story is lighthearted, filled with self-deprecating
humor as he takes readers along on a kind of anti-adventure.</TE>
<TE>   In its more serious moments, the tale is also a caveat emptor,
reminding us not only of what's at stake when we walk onto a car lot,
but what's on the line when we buy into earnest ideals like "American
dream" without first kicking the tires.</TE>

<HD>For Opening, They'll Pray-- Then Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN CONWAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a place of worship, but when the new Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels opens next month, its grounds will become a place to
party. At two social events--one formal, one less so--Catholics and
non-Catholics will gather on its 2.5-acre Grand Plaza to celebrate
what billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad calls another "jewel in the
crown of Grand Avenue."</LD>
<LD>   Along with a dedication Mass on Sept. 2 and an ecumenical prayer
service on Sept. 4, two fund-raising galas on Sept. 7 are what remain
of a larger initial plan to celebrate the opening with 16 events. "We
canceled them for economic reasons--we were a little ambitious in our
original thinking," said William M. Close, vice president of the
cathedral advisory board and gala co-chairman. (The Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles has curbed spending in many areas in
response to stock market losses. The prospect of future settlements
in sexual abuse cases is also a concern.)</LD>
<LD>   After the celebrations were scaled back, efforts were focused on
drawing guests from the community at large to the opening-week
activities.</LD>
<TE>   Partygoers on Sept. 7 will be wined and dined and, among other
activities, explore the cathedral's main terrace with its pool and
cascading waterfall by Lita Albuquerque; pass through the 5-ton
bronze cathedral doors cast by sculptor Robert Graham; and view the
muted tapestries of painter John Nava.</TE>
<TE>   They will also hear a demonstration of the cathedral's 6,000-plus
pipe organ, with its ranks of horizontally mounted trumpets. "We want
to show it off--demonstrate that it's not only for religious music,
but for many other types of music," said Phyllis Hennigan, cathedral
donor and gala co-chairwoman. Bach--but not pop--is on the playlist.
"This is an opportunity for everyone to enjoy the cathedral and learn
about the ways they can use it--spiritually or socially--in their
lives," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve hundred tickets--a sellout--ranging from $1,000 per person
to $25,000 for a table for 10 have been purchased for the black-tie
gala that aims to net $1.5 million for the cathedral's community
outreach programs.</TE>
<TE>   For those who purchased tables at the $25,000 level, there is a
social bonus: a private dinner hosted by Broad and his wife, Edythe,
on Sept. 3 at the California Club. It Will be attended by Cardinal
Roger Mahony, cathedral architect Jose Rafael Moneo and cathedral
artists, including Graham and Nava. "I wanted to have this dinner
because it's time to celebrate the fact that we have artists involved
in a great piece of architecture," Broad said.</TE>
<TE>   Guests were beckoned to the formal "Celebration of Dedication"
with the words: "Just as the concrete shingles of the cathedral walls
form the architectural shape of the building, the gathering of the
Los Angeles community at this celebratory event will help to shape
the spirit of the cathedral." The inspiration for the artwork on
4,000 invitations mailed to community leaders and cathedral donors
were the quartet of gilded angels wrapped around the base of the
cathedral's Rosso Laguna marble altar table.</TE>
<TE>   The gala will include a cathedral tour, a formal dinner--filet of
beef and angel food cake catered by Patina and wines from the
cathedral cellar served on tables lighted from beneath--a multimedia
presentation called "A Journey to Light," and dancing to the band
Super Diamond, with its roster of Neil Diamond hits. Lladro
International, a Spanish maker of artistic porcelains, is providing
the party favors.</TE>
<TE>   Held later on the same evening as the black-tie celebration, will
be the less formal, $125-per-person "La Luz" party for 400 people in
another area of the plaza. Two hundred tickets are still available
for that party; invitations went out just last week. The event will
feature a tour, cocktail reception--the menu is tapas, white-wine
sangria and mojitos--and the same media presentation and
entertainment as the formal gala.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guest list will be primarily in their 30s," noted Amanda
Mansour, "La Luz" co-chairwoman. "We wanted to make it possible for
that generation to participate in an event that might otherwise be
prohibitively expensive; for a lower ticket price, they will be
treated to much the same experience as those at the gala
celebration."</TE>
<TE>   Among those planning to attend the festivities are Tom and Margie
Romano of Arcadia. They bought a table for the black-tie gala and
plan to celebrate the historic opening with their three daughters and
other family members. "When cathedrals were built centuries ago, it
took generations," said Margie Romano. "And here we have an
opportunity to not only watch one go from the ground up, but be part
of the opening ceremonies."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Romano loves the idea of being present at the launch of a
cathedral in the city where he grew up. "This is the largest diocese
in the country--4.5 million Catholics," he said. "Being at the
opening will give me satisfaction personally and spiritually."</TE>
<TE>   Buying a gala table "wasn't a religious issue at all" for Roger
Kozberg, senior vice president of insurance brokerage firm Marsh in
Los Angeles. "It had to do with the fact that we are a major downtown
employer," he said. "The cathedral is an important statement and a
wonderful focus for downtown. I'm very interested in downtown being
the real center of Los Angeles. It seemed like an important thing for
us to support. We're no better than the health of our community."</TE>
<TE>   With its new cathedral in the heart of downtown, Los Angeles has
become "a world-class city," said Joanne Kozberg, president of the
Music Center. "L.A. is now among the great cities of the world where
you find your civic, cultural and religious edifices all together in
a cluster."</TE>
<TE>   As Broad observed, "The cathedral is a very important piece of
architecture in what is becoming the city's vital core. And with its
facilities and meeting rooms, it will be a great community asset."</TE>
<TE>   The gala committee has invited Robert H. Egan, producing director
of the Mark Taper Forum, to create "a unique program worthy of a
cathedral opening that will inspire and entertain," said Hennigan,
chairwoman of the Center Theater Group. The 30-minute multimedia
presentation will tell the story of the cathedral using original
music, light, imagery and the spoken word.</TE>
<TE>   "The foremost thing in my mind when I created the program was the
significance of the building on both the sacred and secular levels
and how those two engage each other in the life of this community,"
Egan said. "The program celebrates what is and what is possible in
the church today--the building is a huge symbol of that."</TE>
<TE>   Not only will the social events capping the dedication welcome the
community to the cathedral, "it will raise funds for the poorest of
the poor who live only blocks away," Close said. "It's important to
recognize that a great cathedral has been built in a city that needed
one."</TE>

<HD>A Lot on Their Plates</HD>
<DH>The hunt for antique Czech and German ceramics takes couple
around the world</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 12 years ago, Brenda and Ken Fritz walked into an antique shop
and opened up Pandora's box. Actually, it was a cupboard, a piece of
Americana they were considering buying to add to their already
well-established collection of folk art. It was a pricey piece, and
Brenda wanted to see the inside. And in that one small act, she got
distracted--a distraction has kept the couple busy ever since.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a piece of pottery," she remembers. "And I said,
'What's that?' And the dealer said, 'It's nothing you collect; it's a
piece of Czech pottery.' " The pair walked out of the store with the
pitcher and left the cabinet behind. Neither can remember how much it
cost: Ken thinks $45, Brenda says $65, but both agree they paid much
less than what the sales tax would have been on the kind of
collectibles they were used to buying.</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks later, they were in another shop in another state, again
looking for folk art. In a dusty cabinet behind a counter, they saw
two vases and a pitcher with the same decorative pattern as the
pitcher they now owned. "I said to Brenda, 'Any time you have three
or more of something, you have a collection,' " Ken says. Today, the
couple own 1,000 pieces of Czech and German ceramics, all dating from
the period of that first piece--about 1919 to 1933. Two years ago, in
downsizing from their Westside home of 30 years, the place where they
raised their two now-adult daughters, they sold virtually all of
their vast folk art collection, but they kept the ceramics. Over the
past decade, they have become--they and others believe--the foremost
collectors in the United States of Eastern European Bauhaus-style
ceramics, a very specialized and not at all well-known arena.</TE>
<TE>   The ceramics that fill their current home--a lovely
Mediterranean-style manse on a quiet Venice Beach canal--do not
resemble the expected image of classic Eastern European tableware.
There are no floral patterns, no gold-leaf flourishes. Rather, these
hefty-yet-well-proportioned dinner plates and cake platters, mantle
clocks and vases, biscuit holders and spatulas all are decorated with
bright, colorful geometric patterns that draw upon the international
abstract vocabulary of 1920s and early '30s Modernist art--the
Russian Suprematists and Constructivists, the Italian Futurists and
the German Bauhaus school.</TE>
<TE>   A pie-slice quarter of the surface of a platter is decorated with
a gray-and-white grid, for example; the rest of the circular surface
is a more erratic red and gray pattern of lines and squares. A set of
plates, cups and saucers is striped red, green and blue in colors
reminiscent of a Tartan plaid, then overlaid with a thick black
spider web of radiating lines. A clock and two candleholders on a
mantle display a mix of partial circles, stepped lines, arrows and
other eccentric geometric forms.</TE>
<TE>   It is a vocabulary of forms that to this day can be identified
with its forward-thinking period, shorthand for what was considered
truly modern among people interested in being avant-garde. The Czech
and German ceramics that the Fritzes collect are not art in its high
form, but rather objects made to be used every day--to serve dinner
and dessert, or to top a sideboard. But for a brief time, such
quotidian objects brought the art world into people's homes and made
it an integral part of daily life. Until the Nazis stopped all that.</TE>
<TE>   For the Fritzes, the attraction takes on many layers. They love
the forms and marvel at the variety of the patterns. They love the
hunt and have endless stories of uncovering troves of long-forgotten
treasures at flea markets and in shops all over the world. And they
care deeply about poignant story behind the goods, which were made in
factories largely owned by Jews who employed Jewish workers, people
whose vision the Nazis abhorred and whose mark on the world can be
remembered today, in many cases, only by these remaining
mass-produced objects.</TE>
<TE>   At the Fritzes', the Czech and German pottery pops up everywhere.
A corner display of dozens of cake platters covers the walls, floor
to ceiling, in the dining room. The long upstairs hallway is lined
with rows of biscuit jars, each pot different in shape and pattern
and all of them delicately decorated with the geometry of Modernism.</TE>
<TE>   It is a beautiful and somewhat unfamiliar sight, the useful turned
into formal, artistic arrangements. For the Fritzes, the pieces are
still valued for what they once served up, and they have some pieces
that they actually use as they were originally intended. As
collectibles, however, most of these objects have now become more
precious than their original manufacturers ever could have imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Married 39 years, Ken and Brenda Fritz finish each other's
stories, laugh at each other's jokes and clearly love the same
things. Ken is a producer and manager of musicians who got his start
with the Smothers Brothers--he was executive producer of the
folk-singing duo's original TV show, "The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour"--and has worked with such legendary artists as Peter, Paul and
Mary. These days he's scaled back considerably, representing only one
singer, a jazz vocalist named Steve Tyrell who's been touring this
summer with Linda Ronstadt.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda is active in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's
volunteer Art Museum Council, helping to place art in corporations,
and is a co-chair of the Los Angeles Antiques Show. The pair travel
often, much of their unscheduled time centered around looking for
treasure.</TE>
<TE>   On one trip to Germany a few years ago, Brenda says, they went to
every small decorative-art museum in every small town, just to
educate themselves. "Nobody was in them but us; nobody goes to them,"
she says. They also shopped along the way, traveling by train
throughout. "We looked like fleeing refugees," she says, laden with
packages of goods to bring home.</TE>
<TE>   Exploring often yields some real high points for such passionate
collectors. "We were in Darmstadt" three years ago, Ken remembers,
"one of the major factory centers where a lot of this stuff was made.
We were walking down the street, on our way to get lunch, and there
was a junk shop--a knickknack shop for antiques. And I said, 'OK,
let's go in.' The room was small, and when we walked in the front
door, we did what we always do: She went in one direction and I went
in the other. I walked over to this corner, and there under these
shelves ... I put my hand over my mouth and I said 'Bren, it's the
mother lode.'</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it," he continues, smiling broadly at the
pleasure of the memory. "It was as if someone had picked up our
collection and put it under these shelves. And I was on my hands and
knees pulling stacks of dishes and objects out, and I started
carrying them over to the counter. And the woman said. 'What would
you like?' She spoke to us in English, and I said, 'Everything.' And
she just was so flustered, and she said, well, this will take me a
long time; I don't have enough packing material. And I said, 'We're
going to have lunch, and we'll come back. Let us know how much it
is.' " Many of the best platters now on display in their dining room
came from that one fortuitous find.</TE>
<TE>   Ken won't say how much they paid that day, but he does say that in
the early days, you could buy pieces for $20 or less. These days, the
same material would cost many hundreds. Pieces they've bought for $35
can now go for $250 or $350. A friend paid $3,500 for a bowl, and
they have one like it that they found in Australia for less than
one-tenth the price, Ken says. So where buying in bulk once made
sense, today the Fritzes carry pictures of what they own to make sure
they're not duplicating themselves. And the time they've spent
looking and holding the materials has made them connoisseurs,
settling now only for the good stuff. "We've never thought of it as
investments," Ken says. "If it doesn't appeal to you, it doesn't
matter if you get it for a nickel."</TE>
<TE>   Ken says that having bought 1,000 pieces, they've probably
considered--and handled--about 25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "If my eyes are closed and I pick up a piece, I can tell generally
whether it's German or Czech by the weight, and almost always by the
feel. There's no question that a German glaze is different than any
other glaze. It's more silky, it's more a satiny, silky feel." And
because much of the work was made for export, the finds can come
anywhere. The Fritzes have found pieces in England, Argentina, Brazil
and even Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Gerhard Westermeier, an art and antiques dealer whose gallery is
in Munich but who also often brings material to New York, says that
over the last eight or so years he has come to know the Fritzes as
friends and as customers. "When they first visited me in my gallery
and saw some pieces, I was astonished that somebody from America was
interested," he said by phone from Munich. "Most Germans don't know
what it is. Ken asked me if I had any more, and I said, 'Yes, it's in
the backyard,' a place where I put things that have minor value, that
I don't want to show. I like these works personally, but most people
don't know about it. He was so eager, I invited him to come to my
house."</TE>
<TE>   The relationship grew, and as Westermeier over time brought
hundreds of such pieces to the U.S. to sell at New York antiques
shows, the Fritzes were always there, getting the first look. "They
came when I was unpacking," Westermeier said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way you have to do it," Ken says when told what
Westermeier said. "We have climbed in and out of the back of a lot of
vans in our lives." Adds Brenda: "The fun of it is the exercise of
your eye being honed--it's easy to buy from a dealer on Madison
Avenue."</TE>
<TE>   If it means getting up at 5 a.m. to be first at a flea market,
even after working on a concert that ended just three hours before,
the Fritzes don't mind. It's their passion. "I think there's a
feeling all collectors have when they see something they want to own.
It gets you emotionally. You're compelled to buy. You appreciate the
aesthetic of the thing, and you just want to live with it."</TE>
<TE>   They've slowed down on the ceramics now--their house is full, and
they regret that some of the pieces have to be stored in the garage,
waiting for Brenda to create a new corner where they can place them.</TE>
<TE>   The advent of EBay has also changed things, replacing and
diminishing the camaraderie of the swap meet, with its exchange of
not only goods, but also information. But the Fritzes are still
researching what they own, cataloging and looking for new finds. They
say they are ever ready to buy, in bulk or not, when something
catches their eye.</TE>
<TE>   "If you see things, and they're really good, you have to buy it
right then," Ken says. "You don't get a second chance, usually, to
consider."</TE>

<HD>It's Hardly All Greek to Students</HD>
<DH>The ancient empire must now jostle for time in the
classroom</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP KENNICOTT</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The multicultural dust may finally be settling on the ancient Greeks,
those deadest of the Dead White Males supposedly evicted from the
cultural center ring over the last three decades by a new national
educational focus on minorities, women and non-Western cultures.
Despite dire predictions--consider the title of the 1998 book "Who
Killed Homer?" by two conservative California classicists--the
ancient Greeks are still holding on, if only by their teeth in some
cases.</LD>
<LD>   At a recent weeklong seminar about ancient Greece at the
University of Maryland, given for Maryland middle and high school
teachers, two things are clear: The Greeks have become more foreign
and exotic, and now jostle for a place with societies and cultures
once deemed "distant" from the United States, such as ancient China
and the Islamic world; at the same time, good teachers can keep the
Greeks vital by learning how to teach about them surreptitiously.</LD>
<LD>   The Greeks will survive, according to participants, because those
who teach about them are learning to do what the Greeks never could
do back when they ruled the Mediterranean 2,500 years ago: Adapt.</LD>
<TE>   The seminar, organized by the university's Center for Renaissance
and Baroque Studies and co-sponsored by the state Department of
Education, brought together two dozen middle and high school teachers
for lectures, discussions and workshops with area theater
professionals. It attracted a cross-section of teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The seminar was held against the backdrop of changing educational
mandates, many of which place an increasing premium on testing and
evaluation, and curriculum standards that lay out in detail what
students must know and when.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say the Greeks have been de-emphasized," says Nan
Collins, a high school art teacher in Maryland. "But there is a new
recognition of non-Western cultures and rightly so. The problem is
that teachers have had a lot added to their plates, while nothing has
been removed," says Collins, who has taught for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Many state guidelines around the country tend to focus high school
history and social studies lessons on American history and civics.
That leaves ancient Greece primarily as fodder for middle school,
after which, unless teachers are creative, it's entirely possible
that students won't hear any more of it until college.</TE>
<TE>   "The tendency is to cover this material in seventh grade," says
Penny Cipolone, a classics teacher who is also public relations
chairwoman for the National Junior Classical League, an organization
for students and teachers of Latin and Greek at the middle and high
school levels.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very badly about that, because while there is a lot you
can do with younger children, you can't get them into philosophy or
reading theater," says Cipolone. "I certainly wouldn't hand a
seventh-grader 'Oedipus.' And so you end up with a very superficial
knowledge of ancient civilization."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly frustrating for high school teachers, says Collins,
is dredging up the mostly forgotten remnants of junior high lessons
when it's necessary to make connections--to show, say, the influence
of Athenian democracy on American democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge gap between sixth and ninth grade," she says.
"Even with very bright kids, the foundation isn't there to make the
connections you want to make later on....A lot of teachers feel that
they don't have the time ... to go back and revisit the history."</TE>
<TE>   The Greeks (and Romans) may also suffer because much of what is
most fascinating about them is generally considered well past a PG
rating (especially for middle school); it was a society of
intellectual complexity, and great violence, and it is riven with
sexuality in a way that is difficult to scrub clean for student
consumption.</TE>
<TE>   This creates interesting dangers for teachers. One Latin teacher
remembers sending a student off to research the vestal
virgins--seemingly a safe topic, given that they're virgins--only to
find that the student had downloaded an Internet picture of the god
Priapus trying to get his hands on a vestal virgin. "That one did not
get included on the poster we were making," she says.</TE>
<TE>   A persistent question hangs in the air at the seminar: Just how
foreign are the ancient Greeks?</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, author Eva C. Keuls described them as "a society
dominated by men who sequester their wives and daughters, denigrate
the female role in reproduction, erect monuments to male genitalia,
have sex with the sons of their peers, sponsor public whorehouses,
create a mythology of rape, and engage in rampant saber rattling."
Foreign indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath--the authors of "Who Killed
Homer?"--took a very different view, arguing that the Greeks, for all
their faults, are the source of everything that is good about
democracy and capitalism. And so the Greeks remain as they ever were:
wildly strange and uncannily familiar, a source of embarrassment and
a source of pride.</TE>
<TE>   Except in many middle and high schools, where time constraints and
other pressures have left little time to explore the Greeks even as a
flash point for cultural controversy. Instead, they've become
interesting oddities on a vast smorgasbord of ancient and foreign
cultures that, some feel, leave them merely ciphers.</TE>
<TE>   At the seminar, there was a sense that the best one can hope to do
is deal with the form, rather than the content, of Greek culture. One
can show students an ancient amphitheater, but there's rarely time to
actually read a Greek play.</TE>
<TE>   If the Greeks are becoming more foreign and exotic in this
country, there's evidence that they're being adopted by people
seemingly remote from their legacy. Karen Carr, an associate
professor of history at Portland State University in Oregon, has
created a Web site to introduce students to ancient Greece
(www.historyforkids.org). She's noticed the usual pattern in this
country: lots of hits from middle school students, and a smattering
of hits from high school students who are reading "The Odyssey" in a
literature class. And one other thing: "I would say a third of the
visitors are from Hong Kong, China, Singapore, other Asian countries.
And they're very interested."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers face pressure to move past the Greeks at the same time
that schools are trying to concentrate more on what traditionalists
consider the greatest legacy of the Greeks: democratic society. "As a
result of Sept. 11th, and the sense of being more embattled in a
hostile world, there's a greater concern with what it means to be
American and the American legacy," she says. "And yet there's a
tendency to focus on the shaping of American identity without the
roots. It's an identity cut off from the past, more insular."</TE>

<LD>Pop Quiz: Sharks and Their Relatives</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean on the planet. It is home
to many kinds of fish, including sharks and their relatives. Try to
match the right fish with the clue given below.</LD>
<LD>   A. thorny ray; B. sand tiger shark; C. nurse shark; D. round ray;
E. sawfish; F. blacktop reef shark.</LD>
<TE>   ___ 1. This shark has very strong mouth suction. It can suck up
its prey from hard-to-reach places.</TE>
<TE>   ___ 2. This ray is also called a porcupine ray shark because of
sharp "thorns" on its back.</TE>
<TE>   ___ 3. This animal is related to sharks and rays and has a large
"saw" at the front of its head for digging in the sand in search of
fish and for stunning its prey.</TE>
<TE>   ___ 4. This shark lives around coral reefs and has black tips on
its dorsal (top) fins and caudal (tail) fin.</TE>
<TE>   ___ 5. This large shark has gotten a bad reputation because of its
outwardly pointed teeth. In fact, it is generally harmless to people.</TE>
<TE>   ___ 6. This small stingray gets its name from its round body
shape.</TE>

<HD>Sounds Like a Plot Worthy of 'Friends'</HD>
<DH>It's just another 'boyfriend debut,' until she finds out
her husband was once the shrink of her girlfriend's new flame</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE MARIE LASKAS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new boyfriend debut is, of course, the single most thrilling event
to be shared among loyal and caring and inquiring-minds-want-to-know
girlfriends. It's what we live for. It's what we've worked so hard
for. It's the beautiful manifestation of all that talking we did over
all those years while we imagined and erased and imagined ... the
One.</LD>
<LD>   "So, is he the One?" Kathryn asks. "Oh, please," Linda says,
throwing her hand up dismissively. "He's just someone ... I've been
seeing," she says. "A lot."</LD>
<LD>   Oh, my. Sure seems like the One to us. We are old friends, the
sort who can go a year without seeing one another and then pick up
right where we left off.</LD>
<TE>   "He's just stopping by for dessert," Linda says. "I didn't want
this to be some high-pressure thing."</TE>
<TE>   "Of course not," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "No big deal," Kathryn says.</TE>
<TE>   Nosiree. We stir our noodles in silence. We can't eat! We have so
much to do! We have notes to prepare in our heads, silent strategies
to develop and transmit over well-worn paths of girlfriend telepathy.
A new boyfriend debut!</TE>
<TE>   Holy Babe Convergence! We will have to move in quickly, assess,
construe, deduce. We will need to see how he looks at her, we will
need to note body language. We will need to find a polite way of
garnering factual material, including any details of pivotal past
relationships. We will need to move on to his relationship with his
mother, its entire history and present state. We will need to know if
he is good enough for Linda.</TE>
<TE>   He enters. We stand and shake hands. He is open and friendly and
easy and sweet; the first-impression factor is indeed quite high.
He's cute, he's got curly hair, he's a dentist who has the good sense
to not, in our presence, utter the words root canal. His adoration
for Linda is palpable, as is hers for him. But now the real work
begins, the digging for morsels of background material that might
provide keys to character.</TE>
<TE>   I make an awkward joke about dental versus mental health and then
somehow find myself talking about my husband's new slippers, which
feature a cartoon rendition of Sigmund Freud and which he refers to
as his "Freudian slippers." The new boyfriend smiles politely and
says, "So your husband is a psychologist?" I confirm and say that
Alex works downtown. He says, "Alex? " He asks me where his office
is. And when I answer, I watch the face of the new boyfriend go from
Earth to Mars and back again. "My shrink!" he says. "That's my
shrink!"</TE>
<TE>   Oh, my. Oh-my! I must say this is a first. His shrink!</TE>
<TE>   Not that having a shrink is a red flag. We think shrink-having is
a good sign in a man. But--my husband? "I haven't seen him in a few
years now," he says. "Tell him I'm doing great, OK?"</TE>
<TE>   "Um, I'm not sure I'm supposed to do that," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my life is an open book," he says. "Just ask Alex."</TE>
<TE>   We have been thrown off our game plan plenty of times and in
plenty of ways, but never quite like this.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we get up to leave, we feel as if the new boyfriend is
a member of the family. A nice, normal guy with seemingly little to
hide. "Tell Alex I said hi!" he says to me.</TE>
<TE>   So when I get home I do. I look in Alex's eyes for a glimmer, a
smile or a split second of horror--just a sign. Instead, I am met
with the blankest of stares. He won't say anything. I am at once
frustrated and relieved and amazed at his ability to keep so much
intrigue locked in his head. He goes to the freezer, gets out a bowl
and we sit through one, two, three silent scoops of mint chocolate
chip.</TE>

<HD>How the Cathedral Will 'Become Catholic'</HD>
<DH>Oil, incense and relics will figure prominently in the
ritual-intensive dedication ceremony</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The invitation is for a Mass of Dedication, but that barely hints at
the elaborate plans for the opening of Our Lady of the Angels
Cathedral. On that day, Sept. 2, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, five
bishops and a monsignor will bless the new building from its bronze
entrance doors to its red marble altar, in a service modeled on the
first sacrament for all Christians. Our Lady of the Angels is about
to be baptized.</LD>
<LD>   "A church becomes a Catholic the same way a person becomes a
Catholic," says Paul Ford, a professor of liturgy at St. John's
Seminary in Camarillo, who is among those overseeing plans for the
event. A simple baptism takes a few minutes to complete, but this one
will be far from simple. "Many things can be done during the
ceremony," Ford says. "We're doing them all." The dedication ceremony
is expected to last three hours.</LD>
<LD>   Invited guests only will fill the 3,000 spaces in the sanctuary,
led by some 500 priests, 65 bishops, archbishops and cardinals and 40
seminarians. Six hundred practicing Roman Catholics have been invited
by their parish priests; a number of them will assist during the
service by lighting candles, ushering, preparing the altar for Mass
and attending to the cardinal and bishops.</LD>
<TE>   Several of the main financial donors, construction workers,
artists and craftsmen who worked on the building and its furnishings
also have a role to play in the ceremonies. When Cardinal Mahony
leads the opening procession across the plaza to the main doors,
starting at 10 a.m., construction workers will meet him there and
present him with the plans for the building along with a list of all
those who worked on the city block-sized compound.</TE>
<TE>   The scale of the cathedral and the rarity of the event have
inspired one such dramatic gesture after another. (The last time a
cathedral was dedicated in California was 1971, when the Cathedral of
St. Mary of the Assumption in San Francisco was blessed.) Relics of
several saints will be carried in the procession and later buried in
the floor near the altar. Among them is a relic of Blessed Junipero
Serra, the 18th century Spanish priest who founded a number of the
California missions, starting in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Nigerian and Scottish drum music and a 75-member choir will
capture most of the attention until the crowds are settled inside the
building. Then the Mass begins. "It is the longest rite in the Roman
Catholic Church," Ford said of the ritual-intensive program. "We
expect it to last three hours, but at one time it would have lasted
six."</TE>
<TE>   In the 13th century, when the basic steps for the dedication of a
new cathedral were first written down, instructions included three
processions around the building's exterior followed by 125 procedures
that were mainly intended to exorcise demons. "Many of the earliest
churches had been Roman government buildings, or basilicas," Ford
said. "They were considered pagan."</TE>
<TE>   After the Second Vatican Council of the mid-'60s, when plans for
modernizing the ancient Catholic traditions were laid out, the
dedication rite was trimmed to its current form. It now more closely
resembles the Easter Vigil Mass in which new members of the church
are baptized as part of the service.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the first blessings of the morning, Mahony will pray at
the new cathedral's 12-foot-wide baptismal pool near the entrance to
the sanctuary. From there, he and his assisting bishops will walk the
aisles, sprinkling the congregation and the walls with newly blessed
water from the pool as a sign of cleansing.</TE>
<TE>   The dozens of candles, statues and flower vases found in most of
the world's Catholic cathedrals will be noticeably absent here. Bare
walls, as austere as a monastery chapel, are a striking feature of
the interior of Our Lady of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   After three Scripture readings and a homily, attention turns back
to the building and its furnishings. Mahony will pour oil over the
marble altar and rub it into the stone with his hands. If he were
dedicating a cathedral in the Middle Ages, the altar would then be
covered with charcoal and wax, to represent the wounds of the
crucified Christ, and set on fire to symbolize its purification.</TE>
<TE>   "Some very old altars still have melted wax embedded in them,"
Ford said. "But you run the risk of cracking the stone. These days it
is rarely done."</TE>
<TE>   From the altar, Mahony and his assistants will go to the walls,
place their hands in bowls of oil set there and smear it on the
absorbent concrete walls in the form of a cross--the largest one they
can manage. "It is much more meaningful to use religious symbols in a
large way," says Sandra Dooley, associate director of the Los Angeles
Archdiocese's Office for Worship.</TE>
<TE>   Washed with water and sealed with oil, the new cathedral will
carry the same markings as the baptized Catholics who hope to make
Our Lady of the Angels a spiritual home. As a final step in the
dedication, Mahony will cense the altar, a symbol for prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Starting that day, a priest saying Mass at the cathedral will kiss
the altar before he begins. For the dedication Mass, however, Mahony
will wait until after he has consecrated it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an important moment when the cardinal kisses the new altar,"
said Ford. "An anointed altar becomes a sign of Christ." In a similar
way, the blessed walls represent the Apostles, who were the
foundation of the early church.</TE>
<TE>   To extend the censing of the altar through the building, a group
of Vietnamese nuns from the Lovers of the Holy Cross religious order
will walk the sanctuary carrying incense burners and singing in
Vietnamese and English.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hymn is about God's love for all people," said Sister Mary,
one of the nuns, whose convent is in Gardena. "The rhythm of the hymn
is unique and close to our Vietnamese culture."</TE>
<TE>   When all the steps are complete, the Mass will resume, celebrated
by all of the priests, who will wear vestments made for the occasion.
These identical garments will be the first additions to the
cathedral's wardrobe closet.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare the altar, it will be covered by a patchwork of fabrics
that represent the largest ethnic groups in the archdiocese:
Hispanic, African American, Asian as well as Caucasian.</TE>
<TE>   Assistants (about 100 in all will play a part in the ceremonies)
will carry baskets of food to the altar to be distributed later as
part of the cathedral's social outreach program. "A liturgy is the
work of the people," Dooley explained. "In this case, lots of people
and lots of work."</TE>
<TE>   After the Communion service, Mahony will place the extra Communion
bread in the Blessed Sacrament chapel to the side of the main altar.
An extended "Alleluia" chorus and one last procession will end the
ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   Some people will probably stay and listen to the organ music that
will continue afterward, or they may walk the aisles for a better
look at the alabaster windows, the cardinal's chair of exotic woods,
the bronze angels at the base of the dedication candles.</TE>
<TE>   Ford expects guests to do this based on what happened when he
brought his seminary students to tour the building several weeks ago.
"We walked from the plaza inside, along the corridor into the main
space, singing," he recalled. "All of a sudden, everyone stopped.
They just wanted to look."</TE>

<LD>Maria and her younger brother Alfonso were finishing their camp
lunch, which included fresh-roasted corn on the cob.</LD>
<LD>   "Isn't that delicious?" asked their Uncle Ruben, who was the
nature guide at the camp.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes," said Maria.</LD>
<TE>   "It's better than corn from the can," said Alfonso, smacking his
lips.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know that we grow that corn here at camp?" asked Uncle
Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   "No," said both children.</TE>
<TE>   "And it tastes so good because we grow it using compost that we
make out back," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "What's compost?" asked Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "Compost is when you pile up all the grass clippings, old leaves
and all the kitchen scraps from our meals. It slowly turns into rich
black soil--compost, and it's great for gardening. Come on, I'll show
you."</TE>
<TE>   Maria and Alfonso went in the back of the large camp kitchen to a
sunny flat area.</TE>
<TE>   "First, we make a large square from these big cement blocks," said
Uncle Ruben, pointing to the cement block bin. The square measured 4
by 4 feet. It was about 3 feet high on all sides except the front,
where it was only about 2 feet high.</TE>
<TE>   The children looked carefully as Uncle Ruben pulled back an old
carpet that had been covering the top, letting out steam. There were
lawn clippings, leaves and kitchen scraps. "I water it sometimes
too," said Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   He shoveled out a bucketful of the rich black soil and poured it
at the base of the nearby corn plants. He dug his fingers into the
soil at the base of the corn, and showed the children that the soil
was soft and full of hundreds of red earthworms.</TE>
<TE>   "That's living soil," said Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," said Maria, "I can hardly wait to make compost at home."</TE>
<TE>   "We'll grow corn too," Alfonso said with a smile.</TE>

<TE>   Christopher Nyerges and his wife, Dolores, are the directors of
School of Self-reliance, www.self-reliance.net. They have taken
hundreds of children on nature walks since 1974. Christopher Nyerges

<HD>If There Are No Words to Describe It, Well, You Can Just
Make Them Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJA MILLS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spread by e-mail, Web sites and plain old-fashioned word-of-mouth,
new words bounce around English faster than dictionary editors--or
anyone else--can track.</LD>
<LD>   Often, people come up with new terms to fill what dictionary
editor Erin McKean calls English's "semantic gaps," where a word
could exist but does not.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the terms arise as pure whimsy. Others are sure signs of
the times, such as "e-dress," an e-mail address.</LD>
<TE>   Most made-up words never gain wide circulation, but every now and
then one emerges with staying power.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," says McKean, a senior editor with Oxford
University Press-USA. After a recent article about McKean, readers
sent in words they have made up or noticed being used.</TE>
<TE>   Linguistic legs or not, here is a sampling:</TE>
<TE>   Cellicide (cell-a-cide) n . Killing of pedestrians, cyclists,
motorists and passengers in accidents caused by drivers distracted by
use of their cell phones. Cellicidal--adj.--Duane Carlson, Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Chillaxing (chill-axing) n. Chilling out and relaxing. Spotted
online and heard in conversation with area teens.--Kathleen Eng,
Skokie, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Frustankerous (frus-tank-er-us) adj. My wife (Olena) and I have
invented a word to describe the behavior of our 11-month-old boy who,
when he doesn't get what he wants, acts both frustrated and
cantankerous. This behavior includes yelling, pounding fists, working
up his face to cry, but also looking angry.--Robert S. Marshall,
Evanston, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Chompacuted (chom-pac-uted) vt.  When you get mangled and
electrocuted at the same time. My friend Jesse was always scared at
the elevated stations of getting hit by a train and kept saying, "I
don't want to get chompacuted!" ... He is an aspiring filmmaker and
plans to use it in a film someday, so maybe it will see the light of
day sometime.--Brendan Walsh, Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   E-dress (e-dress) n.  An e-mail address. Several months ago, in
the midst of retrieving/logging daily e-mail and phone messages to
paper, and quite by accident, I elided the words for "e-mail address"
into "e-dress." As I read it back, I thought it quite clever, and
asked my co-workers if they had ever read or heard of such a term. It
seems to be a natural reference to such a, now, often-used term. No
one I have spoken to has seen or heard of it since I suggested
it.--Karin Magnuson, Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Disenhancement (dis-en-hance-mint) n.  To be used as follows: (1)
When a computer company issues a new, expensive update of its
software, which fixes current bugs and introduces new ones. (2) When
an airline, along with some minor changes, requires 25,000 instead of
20,000 miles for a free ticket. At the present time these are called
"enhancements."--Alan D. Corre, Milwaukee, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Gak (gack) n. Here's a word I made up in the '70s....It was the
sound my cat made while coughing up hairballs. The word "gak" later
evolved from onomatopoeia to a noun, as in "What is this gak in the
sink?"--Linda M. Cain, Schaumburg, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Ginormous (gin-or-mus) adj. Uncommonly large; ridiculously out of
proportion with surrounding environment; large beyond all
expectations. [This] is a word I think my sister made up, but
everyone who hears it begins to use it because it sounds funny and is
just the perfect word to describe certain things.--Michael Page,
Geneva, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Kinly (kin-lee) adj.  Someone who is not blood relation, nor an
in-law, but is nonetheless connected to a family. Such as my
brother's in-laws ... his mother-in-law is my "kinly."--Michelle
McMullin, Aurora, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Natchachuk (natch-a-chuk) v. My mom, Arlene Schau, made this word
up so long ago we grew up thinking it was a real word--either
Hungarian or Polish (which our mother is). Its meaning has evolved to
be either "give that to me" or "let me do that."--Tim Schau, Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Shophopping (shop-hop-ping) n.  As in "I refuse to go
'shophopping,' hunting sales or bargains from store to store." Going
from one store to the next in search of the right fit or a flattering
style qualifies too.--Joan R. Hahn, Arlington Heights, Ill.</TE>

talked about, whether well known or not.--John O'Neal, Glenwood, Ill.</TE>

Stephen Conard made up (but my friends are starting to use) is
"verbivore," a noun to describe those of us who thrive on
words.--Linda Conard, Springfield, Va.</TE>

<HD>From Girl Power to Star Power: What's Next for 'Idol'
Maker?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only a few moments after a live broadcast of Fox's "American Idol"
had gone off the air and the cameras had gone dark on the Hollywood
sound stage where the series is taped, the already giddy level of the
contestants vying for fame and fortune went into overdrive as they
made a beeline for Simon.</LD>
<LD>   "How do you think we really sounded?" asked one "Idol" hopeful of
the smiling British show-business mogul. "Does Madonna watch the
show?" inquired another. Simon good-naturedly fielded the questions
as the throng surrounded him as if he were a teen idol.</LD>
<LD>   This Simon is not Simon Cowell, the sharp-tongued judge whose
scathing criticisms of the wannabe idol has been a key factor behind
the success of the unscripted series, in which young performers
compete for a recording contract.</LD>
<TE>   This is the kinder, gentler Simon--Simon Fuller, the creator of
"American Idol" who is better known as the creative and marketing
guru behind the Spice Girls and the internationally popular youth
group S Club 7. Fuller, who lives in Britain, was making his first
visit to the set (CBS' Television City, next to the Farmers Market).</TE>
<TE>   An unassuming multimillionaire who seems as comfortable with crew
members as he is around British pop stars and royalty, he runs his
production company, 19 Entertainment, with a roster of top artists,
producers and songwriters. Despite the pronouncements of Howard
Stern, it's Fuller who might have the rightful claim to the title of
King of All Media.</TE>
<TE>   Under Fuller's guidance, the Spice Girls sold more than 38 million
albums, starred in a movie, were endorsed by Pepsi and were featured
on numerous pieces of merchandising. Fuller also manages the solo
career of former Eurythmics member Annie Lennox.</TE>
<TE>   However, it's the breakthrough of "American Idol," combined with
the popularity of its British predecessor, "Pop Idol," that has made
Fuller a force to be reckoned with in American TV circles. As he did
in Europe, he hopes to conquer Hollywood with his brand of trendy
music-flavored projects.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had lots of ideas," Fuller said of his flurry of
meetings with TV and movie studios during the last few months. "I'm
finding that there are more doors opening now thanks to 'American
Idol.' "</TE>
<TE>   He has new ventures set up with NBC and ABC, and the sequel to
"American Idol" for next summer is already being mapped out for Fox.
And no wonder Fox wants more. "Idol" is the second-highest-rated
original show of the summer (after NBC's "Dog Eat Dog"), averaging
more than 10 million viewers each Tuesday and Wednesday it airs. Even
that number is somewhat misleading, because the show's ratings are
growing each week as it approaches its finale.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Darnell, Fox's executive vice president for specials and
alternative programming, called Fuller a "terrifically creative"
insider who works "with a gleam in his eye. He seems to have a pulse
on what's really going to work. And when it comes to the marriage of
music and television, he's the master. He told us in detail what
would happen with 'American Idol,' how the whole country would be
watching. And that's exactly what's happened."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller's specialty is spotting trends and expanding on them: "I'm
always looking for them, looking for ways to expand them." Part of
the inspiration for the Spice Girls was the film "Clueless," in which
Fuller saw young girls "being sassy and funny. I thought that was a
concept that could be expanded on."</TE>
<TE>   Like the musical and marketing strategies that made the Spice
Girls omnipresent during their late '90s heyday, Fuller's visions are
not unlike synergistic building blocks constructed into a multimedia
whole. The marketing and commercial potentials are critical
components of the concepts.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone talks about synergy, but no one really does it," he
says. "I like to cover all the bases. We can cross over into all
kinds of genres with the same idea. A good idea can work on many
levels."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Fuller is making a valiant effort to relax in the
living room of a West Hollywood hotel suite during a recent
interview, his enthusiasm seems to put him in constant motion. He is
surrounded by music: A tape machine and several CDs are within arm's
reach.</TE>
<TE>   And though he is encouraged by his growing status in Hollywood,
don't expect to see him popping up in the tabloids or on
"Entertainment Tonight." Fuller is determined to stay behind the
scenes. Pictures of him, even from the Spice Girls heyday, are rare.
His shyness is offset by a personable, disarming confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Said Nigel Lythgoe, chief executive of 19 Television, a division
of 19 Entertainment: "Simon likes to be the Charlie in 'Charlie's
Angels.' He's not one for the spotlight. He feels there'll be a
certain longevity to your career if you don't get the spotlight.
People don't get tired of you or discard you. He's just really
focused on building his ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Taking top priority now with Fuller are the few remaining
installments of "American Idol," which is also produced by
FremantleMedia, and its Sept. 3 and 4 finale at the Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood in front of thousands of screaming fans. The winner--chosen
from 10 finalists--will be selected in a national telephone poll and
will get a recording contract.</TE>
<TE>   Under Fuller's supervision, the finale of "American Idol" will
really be just the beginning. The winner will release a single in
October, followed a few weeks later by a single from the runner-up.
All 10 finalists will be featured on an "American Idol" compilation
album, and the first few dates of a possible nationwide tour by the
10 finalists, which went on sale last weekend, have sold well.</TE>
<TE>   The two "American Idol" finalists will also star in a film musical
that will be released next summer, just in time to hype the beginning
of "American Idol 2."</TE>
<TE>   "My brother Kim [who wrote "Spice World," the Spice Girls movie]
is writing the script now," Fuller said. "It will be a very cute
story. The timing will be perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Other "Idol"-type series are underway or planned for Poland, South
Africa, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries. Fuller is
looking forward to a "World Idol" showdown in which the finalists
from all the "Idol" shows face off for the ultimate "Idol" crown.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller hopes "American Idol" has the same impact that "Pop Idol"
has had in Britain, where it finished its first competition early
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the competition's winner, Will Young, have a
chart-topping hit there, but so have both runner-up Gareth Gates and
Darius Danesh, who had been voted off earlier in the contest.</TE>
<TE>   NBC has already signed on for Fuller's update of "The Monkees,"
about a male musical group "that will also be very heavy on comedy.
They will be great-looking guys. Every other guy in the world will
want to be them."</TE>
<TE>   He is also developing a series for ABC, tentatively called
"Supergirl," on which young women will compete to "become the
ultimate American dream girl." "Each show will be about a different
discipline," he said. "One show will be about singing, one about
acting, one about intelligence. It won't be all about singing and
dancing."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller predicts his other projects will be at least as successful
as "American Idol." He says he is not surprised that the series,
which combines the flavor of a talent show with the edge of
"Survivor," has caught on.</TE>
<TE>   "It really worked in Britain, and it's a great format," he said.
He maintains that he is often surprised by the show's outcome, saying
he was caught off guard when provocatively dressed 19-year-old Ryan
Starr was voted off by viewers a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what makes it a great show," he says. "Maybe the world is
looking for more than just looks. It really is anyone's race. And the
show just keeps getting better and better."</TE>
<TE>   Public and industry response to his projects has more than made up
for his disappointment at being dismissed by the Spice Girls at the
peak of their popularity. The group has since broken up.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed because my vision for them had not reached
completion," he said. He had planned more albums and solo ventures
for the singers that would have built on their massive popularity.</TE>
<TE>   He is managing Emma "Baby Spice" Bunton. As for a possible Spice
Girls reunion, he smiled, saying, "Who know what the future holds?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite the mountain of projects, he said he is not stressed or
tired: "I really do love what I do, no kidding. When it's like that,
there is no such thing as getting fatigued."</TE>

<HD>Reviving 'Kiss Me, Stupid' Is a No-Brainer</HD>
<DH>Movies* Restoration of a censored seduction scene improves
the overlooked 1964 Billy Wilder-Izzy Diamond comedy starring Dean
Martin as 'Dino.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere Billy Wilder and his writing partner Izzy Diamond must be
having a good laugh right now, because "Kiss Me, Stupid," the late
pair's most maligned comedy, a 1964 meltdown of the American Dream
and the Rat Pack mystique starring Dean Martin as a version of
himself, is making the retro rounds with great success.</LD>
<LD>   The film screens tonight through Thursday at the Nuart Theater
after being held over for more than a week in New York this summer.
The print then travels to Chicago this weekend before moving on to
Berkeley, Detroit and Austin, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The good news is that the print contains a once-censored seduction
scene that MGM recently discovered when comparing the international
and domestic versions. This crucial scene, which takes place in a
trailer, had been re-shot by Wilder for domestic release in an
attempt to appease the then-influential Catholic Legion of Decency,
which had threatened to condemn the film for lewd sexuality and
marital infidelity. It's been reinstated with the approval of
Wilder's widow, Audrey.</LD>
<TE>   In many ways, "Kiss Me, Stupid" was jinxed from the start. First,
original co-star Peter Sellers had a heart attack four weeks into
production and was replaced by "My Favorite Martian's" Ray Walston.
Next, co-star Kim Novak sustained a painful back injury. Then the
Legion of Decency condemned it despite the re-shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Kiss Me, Stupid" flopped with American viewers and
critics, with the notable exception of the perceptive Joan Didion,
who heralded "Wilder's world ... seen at dawn through a hangover." As
far as Wilder was concerned, the film did not translate well from the
Italian costume farce "L'Ora della Fantasia," even though he loved
working with Martin.</TE>
<TE>   It's taken nearly 40 years and the death of Wilder to rehabilitate
this unappreciated gem, though Andrew Sarris and a few other
contemporary critics have been singing its praises for quite some
time. In fact, when Sarris wrote a tribute to the legendary
writer-director this year in the New York Observer, he included "Kiss
Me, Stupid" among his 10 Wilder favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing "Kiss Me, Stupid" today makes one wonder what all the
censorship fuss was about. It's almost quaint compared to the
mean-spirited and gross-out comedies made today (Wilder predicted the
coming of a more vulgar trend right after he made the film). But it's
important to remember that in 1964, sexual mores were just beginning
to change on screen as a result of best picture winner "Tom Jones"
(1963) and such popular imports as "Divorce, Italian Style" (1961).</TE>
<TE>   At the height of their popularity with a string of hits that
included "Some Like it Hot" (1959), "The Apartment" (1960) and "Irma
la Douce" (1963), Wilder and Diamond wanted to experiment with
something more hip and daring. What they didn't realize was that
people in this country were not quite ready to watch such a sordid
comedy about America. They not only demystified the Rat Pack at the
peak of its popularity but also debunked marriage and middle-class
virtue.</TE>
<TE>   Walston and Cliff Osmond play a couple of aspiring songwriters in
godforsaken Climax, Nev., who try to hustle Martin into buying their
lousy songs (which in reality are unpublished works by George and Ira
Gershwin, so the joke's on us) by stranding him for the night and
setting him up with a waitress-prostitute (Novak).</TE>
<TE>   Novak is supposed to pretend to be the wife of the insanely
jealous Walston, who meanwhile picks a fight with his real wife
(Felicia Farr, Jack Lemmon's wife in real life) and sends her packing
to mother to get her out of the way. In a delicious twist of fate,
when she realizes the ruse, Farr can't resist pretending to be Novak,
seducing Martin in Novak's trailer when he comes looking for
"action." She not only fulfills her own personal fantasy but tries to
seal the deal for her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the original trailer scene makes all the difference in the
world. It's funnier, sexier and far more satisfying. "Kiss Me,
Stupid" may be more painful than funny to watch, with its nasty setup
and sadistic husband, but as with Wilder's earlier flop, the acidic
journalistic critique "Ace in the Hole," the audience is glued to the
dreary black-and-white display (in Panavision, no less).</TE>
<TE>   One can only imagine what Sellers might have brought to the role
of insecure piano teacher Orville J. Spooner, who is married to the
prettiest woman in town; more of a madcap innocent, no doubt. But
we're stuck with the awkward Walston, who does grow into the role in
the second half, when his sweet romanticism first comes through with
the help of the melancholy Novak (as Polly the Pistol). Dreams really
can come true in Wilder's world, if only for an instant and when one
least expects it.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the added pleasure of watching Martin as Dino. At
first glance, he appears to be doing a caricature, but don't be
fooled by his ease. Martin is more intoxicating than intoxicated, a
lothario lounge act who is at peace with his own weaknesses and the
most honest character in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron Crowe likes to call Wilder the master of the bittersweet.
It's hard to find a more literal example than "Kiss Me, Stupid." It
may not be up there in the pantheon with "The Apartment," "Some Like
it Hot" and "Sunset Boulevard," but it's not far below other Wilder
favorites.</TE>

<HD>The Lure of the Blockbuster</HD>
<DH>In lusting too feverishly after tourists' dollars, shows
like MOCA's Warhol retrospective play a dangerous game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the first exhibitions the Museum of Contemporary Art organized
when it opened its warehouse space in Little Tokyo was a sprawling
$700,000 survey meant to demonstrate the effect of the automobile on
the creation of important 20th century art. Oddly enough, 1984's "The
Automobile and Culture" demonstrated just the opposite: The effect of
the horseless carriage on painting and sculpture was virtually nil.
Pretty much all cars, no culture, the lackluster show was a critical
flop.</LD>
<LD>   It was also a popular success. One hundred eighty thousand people
streamed through the doors during the lengthy run--a healthy average
of some 1,200 daily visitors to a then-rarely visited part of
downtown.</LD>
<TE>   Next up at MOCA was a terrific mid-career retrospective of
important L.A. Conceptual artist Allen Ruppersberg, modestly budgeted
at $55,000. He first came to attention around 1969 with such
eccentric projects as a cafe and hotel that functioned as actual
businesses and, simultaneously, fictive works of art. The show's
knockout piece consisted of 20 big canvases on which the artist had
handwritten the entire text of Oscar Wilde's illustrious 1890 novel
"The Picture of Dorian Gray." Wilde insisted that life should imitate
art, not the other way around--a philosophy reflected in
Ruppersberg's quirky cafe and hotel. His sprawling homage on canvas
transformed the tidy dictum into a mind-bending meditation.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA's attendance promptly plummeted, cut almost in half.</TE>
<TE>   I thought of those two exhibitions the other day, when I was
making a final visit to MOCA's "Andy Warhol Retrospective" during its
last week. (The show closed Sunday.) You might think a Warhol show
represents the best of both worlds--quality art with popular
appeal--and on one level it does. On a Tuesday morning the galleries
were packed, while lines of waiting visitors stretched down Grand
Avenue. (Over the last six days, it was averaging 5,000 visitors a
day.) And the carefully paced installation was wonderful, populated
with excellent examples and offering a rare opportunity for L.A.'s
art audience to reassess the paintings of a pivotal artist of the
postwar era.</TE>
<TE>   Still, despite loving the show, I was made somewhat queasy by the
enterprise. Not since "The Automobile and Culture" fiasco 18 years
ago has an art exhibition at MOCA been so baldly contrived as a
commercial entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   First MOCA's notorious 2001 billboard and TV ad campaign, whose
Conceptual Lite cute-isms alienated art enthusiasts all over town.
Now this.</TE>
<TE>   The significance of the art was never the principal motivation for
booking the Warhol show, merely a supporting requirement. Nor was
covering costs--nearly $3 million--the goal. The show's priority was
making money, for MOCA and the city.</TE>
<TE>   Final tallies are coming in (see box, F5), but it does seem to
have done that. To which I say: Who cares? Since when should we give
a hoot whether a not-for-profit museum has made a profit?</TE>
<TE>   The profit-driven blockbuster mentality isn't new, of course. Ever
since King Tut's touring tomb relics became a national craze 25 years
ago, blockbusters have mushroomed into a staple of our cultural life.
Indeed, the current exhibition at Washington's National Gallery of
Art--"The Quest for Immortality: Treasures of Ancient Egypt"--is a
kind of silver anniversary of Tut-mania. By most reports the show is
more concerned with ethnology than art history, but its tour of U.S.
museums is scheduled to ramble on for at least five years. Americans
do love their mummies.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the show will drive you to come and visit Egypt," that
country's ambassador explained to the Washington Post about Cairo's
willingness to extend such unusually lengthy loans. In the wake of
Sept. 11, tourist-starved Washington no doubt harbors similar hopes.
Tourists are any blockbuster's lifeblood--which is why MOCA partnered
with the L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau to sell the show to
regional summer tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, tourists are a flimsy visitor base for almost all art
museums. Paris, Florence, New York--only if a city is already
identified with art in the mind of the general public can its art
museums count on general tourist income to fuel operations. Eight
million New Yorkers aren't enough to make its art museums thrive
without the international tourist trade--which is why they're
struggling post-Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Until the past year, Manhattan's art museums were a glorious
aberration. You might say they're currently grappling with the
ordinary dilemma faced every day by art museums in every other
American city: not just how to run a lively, compelling program when
the base constituency is primarily local--but how to afford it.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA has a mixed record on that count. You'd be hard-pressed to
name another contemporary art museum with a better lineup, year in
and year out. But sometimes the museum seems to think its primary
audience lives in the art capitals of Europe, not L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because museum curators know there are lots more professional
colleagues out of town than in town; with an eye on their careers,
they play to it. But most of the art public is composed of amateur
enthusiasts, not professionals. Locally they're the folks who become
museum members, visit commercial galleries now and then, seek out art
when they travel and generally enjoy the experience. Creating a
program that satisfies all art constituencies--professional and
amateur, local and not--is the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Tourist-oriented blockbusters, however, represent a tear in the
art museum fabric. While the general public is being seduced, the art
public is abandoned. "The Automobile and Culture" was pitched toward
anyone who'd ever been in a car. "Andy Warhol Retrospective" was
pitched toward anyone who'd ever been to the movies.</TE>
<TE>   What's the harm in that? Nothing in the short term. For an art
museum, it's quick cash. The risk is slow-motion suicide. The general
public is where the fast action is, but it certainly won't stick
around for the long haul. Lose the art public through attrition,
though, and you might as well close up shop.</TE>
<TE>   Tourist-oriented blockbusters are the art museum equivalent of a
bubble economy. In addition to inflated ticket sales and swollen gift
shop revenues, membership rosters balloon artificially, as shoppers
take advantage of member discounts to see Tut, Van Gogh, Warhol or
another celebrity. When the sales extravaganza is over, the balloon
loses air.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, membership nearly doubled
in the frenzy over 1999's pleasant but unremarkable "Van Gogh's Van
Goghs." From 64,000 it climbed to an astronomical 118,000.
Inevitably, membership has since been floating back to earth, now in
the vicinity of 75,000.</TE>
<TE>   Quick-cash infusions from the general public do little to mitigate
the huge expense involved in servicing that kind of churn in
membership, as the museum labors mightily with mailings, special
offers and events, to retain its hold on people with little real
interest in art. Still, when museum numbers drop, heads must roll.
Sources say LACMA's top staff fund-raiser, vice president for
development Katharine De Shaw, took the fall for the Van Gogh bubble;
hired just after the show closed, she left the museum in May. It's
standard museum Kabuki, creating a ritualized illusion of sound
management.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a fundamental truth gets papered over. The real money
that has always been the bedrock of major art museums is never found
in the wallets of the general public--private, civic, corporate or
foundation. The real money is in the deep pockets of passionate
individual enthusiasts, scattered here and there within the art
public. Design a program that regularly privileges a general public
over an art public, relying on packaged extravaganzas that chug into
town trailing VIP hotel deals, and you'll never tap that.</TE>
<TE>   The good news about MOCA is the 18-year gap between "The
Automobile and Culture" and "Andy Warhol Retrospective." Plus, the
museum doesn't have a large pool of artist-celebrities from which to
draw. Few contemporary artists have Warhol's star power, which
resonates with a general public. Perhaps we can look for the next
blockbuster tourist gig somewhere around 2020.</TE>
<TE>   In his "Dorian Gray" preface, Wilde judiciously observed: "We can
forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire
it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it
intensely. All art is quite useless."</TE>
<TE>   The art museum as tourist trap gives the place a useful job, which
it was never meant to have.</TE>

<DH>Television* The reality is that as 'reality' shows get more
popular, the contestant agreements get more complicated.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rumors and Internet sniping aside, the producers of "American Idol"
insist they have not already designated a winner of the Fox talent
showcase and are not tampering with the rules to manipulate the
outcome.</LD>
<LD>   If push comes to shove, however, they can--or at least are allowed
to under the phone book-thick agreements signed by contestants.</LD>
<LD>   In what they characterize as a corporate necessity of so-called
reality programming, producers say they must retain such options to
protect themselves from litigation--the fear factor, in this case,
being contestants who have demonstrated that they will do just about
anything, from eating bugs to fudging on background information, in
pursuit of a few minutes of fame and financial rewards.</LD>
<TE>   This uncertainty has led to intricate contracts meant to forestall
lawsuits on every conceivable level. So while Fox and "American
Idol's" producers stress that the millions of calls logged from the
public determine who advances toward the show's Sept. 4 finale, the
producers reserved "sole discretion" in determining the winner if
there are problems with the voting procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, contestants agreed that the producers can amend the
rules at any point along the way, though the producers say that
provision exists to ensure the game stays fair, not to dictate who
wins--as an example citing an earlier British version, which allowed
a singer who became ill time to regain his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you do a contract, you have to try to anticipate every
angle, because you can't tell what's going to happen," said Nigel
Lythgoe, one of "Idol's" executive producers, adding that the show
faced rigging accusations in Britain--a contention he unequivocally
denied. "Why on Earth would we want to go against the public?" he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such assurances, Internet sites have second-guessed
"Idol's" results, and rumors have even circulated that the winner has
already been chosen. In addition, Fox acknowledged last week that
overly eager fans have sought to skew the outcome by using
autodialing and high-speed computer connections to submit thousands
of votes from a single line.</TE>
<TE>   Having endured a public-relations nightmare when embarrassing
details surfaced about the would-be groom on "Who Wants to Marry a
Multi-Millionaire?," Fox was quick to say that the volume of calls
from "power dialers" is statistically insignificant and won't affect
who wins; still, the report has fueled suspicions, particularly in
online chat rooms, that the voting is tainted and, more generally,
that "reality" programs can't be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   Although scripted series yield their own headaches, the questions
surrounding "Idol," whether real or imagined, underscore that such
programs pose their own set of problems. Executives admit they are
especially wary of those who appear on the shows--some of whom
function as near-professional contestants, bouncing from one audition
to another.</TE>
<TE>   Given that contestants are willing to risk humiliation or even
death, industry representatives say they must err on the side of
caution legally. "You're dealing with a subculture that makes me, as
a lawyer, antsy to begin with," said one entertainment attorney, on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Kunitz, an executive producer on NBC's stunt-oriented shows
"Dog Eat Dog" and "Fear Factor," has seen such concerns grow since he
started out on MTV's "The Real World."</TE>
<TE>   "The second season of 'The Real World,' the contract was 12 pages
long, and every year it got bigger and bigger," Kunitz said, noting
that the waiver contestants sign on his NBC series currently runs
about 50 pages.</TE>
<TE>   "Every show has a new obstacle ... [because] so many things are
uncontrollable," added Chris Sloan, senior vice president of reality
programming for the USA network. "You're always dealing with
unpredictability."For all the contractual safeguards put in place,
several disgruntled contestants have sued networks and
producers--among them original "Survivor" player Stacey Stillman, who
contends that producer Mark Burnett manipulated the voting to
engineer her ouster. CBS responded with a $5-million countersuit last
year, and that legal battle is still wending its way through the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   A couple featured on "Temptation Island"--kicked off the show
because they had a child together--also filed a defamation suit
against Fox, which stated that Taheed Watson and Ytossie Patterson
didn't divulge the child's existence (the pair said the producers did
know but chose to overlook it), violating the rules. "Big Brother 2"
contestant Krista Stegall, meanwhile, claims CBS was negligent in
failing to unearth assault charges against fellow housemate Justin
Sebik, who was kicked off the program after holding a knife to her
throat.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical principle to keep in mind is that no one is forcing
anyone to participate in these shows," said Jonathan Anschell, a
partner in White O'Connor Avanzado, the Century City law firm
representing CBS in the Stillman case. "When people do participate,
they're told very clearly what rights they're giving up in exchange
for the opportunity to be seen."</TE>
<TE>   Contestants have various motives for appearing, but TV exposure is
certainly among them. In their complaint, Patterson and Watson said
they hoped being on "Temptation Island" would create "positive
television and press exposure to advance their acting/modeling
careers."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the threat of legal action, attorneys concede
waivers only go so far. "No contract can prevent someone from suing,"
Anschell said. "It can prevent someone from winning."</TE>
<TE>   Producers also say they must be particularly diligent in the case
of game shows--a description that does not apply to "American
Idol"--which are held to a higher standard, stemming from the
quiz-show scandals of the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even programs lacking a game element could be undermined if
the public believes them to be rigged.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very careful to keep the game fair and not affect the
outcome," Kunitz said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, "Idol" producer Lythgoe agreed with the notion that
"reality TV" is something of a misnomer. "I never believe in a
'reality' show," he said. "As soon as you turn the camera on, people
start performing."</TE>

<LD>   Simon Will Fill Kennedy Center Slot</LD>
<LD>   Having been stood up temporarily by Paul McCartney, the Kennedy
Center Honors program turned its lonely eyes to Paul Simon,
announcing Monday that the folk-pop icon will join conductor James
Levine and actors Elizabeth Taylor, James Earl Jones and Chita Rivera
as this year's honorees at a gala Dec. 8 at the Kennedy Center in
Washington, D.C. The awards are given in recognition of lifetime
contributions to American culture.</LD>
<TE>   George Stevens Jr., co-founder of the awards program and producer
of its annual CBS telecast, said that McCartney wrote to him about 10
days ago expressing "profoundest apologies" for being unable to keep
his commitment because of a niece's wedding. He didn't know of the
family commitment when he accepted the invitation, the singer
explained.</TE>
<TE>   The former Beatle was the first honoree in the program's 25-year
history to bow out after the announcement had been made. According to
Stevens, the Kennedy Center board embraced McCartney's request that
he be feted in 2003 instead.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's spokesman, Dan Klores, said the singer-songwriter had been
told he was in line for the award in 2003 and was happy to move up.
"I don't think he thinks of himself as a substitute for McCartney,"
he said. "He is honored and feels as if he is blessed."</TE>

<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Controversial Mexican Film Opens Strongly</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's latest controversial film, "El Crimen del Padre Amaro,"
scored big at the box office. In its first weekend, the movie grossed
$3 million--the largest opening ever for a Mexican movie.</TE>
<TE>   The film stars hot young actor Gael Garcia Bernal ("Amores
Perros") as a wayward priest who impregnates a young parishioner. The
theme caused a furor among the country's conservative Catholic
community and prompted a firestorm of publicity that benefited the
film.</TE>
<TE>   The movie was such a lightning rod that even Mexican President
Vicente Fox's mother weighed in over the weekend. Mercedes Quesada
called it "a piece of trash" that was made with the sole intention of
"aggravating Catholics."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico City's major newspapers, however, gave the $1.8-million
film mainly positive reviews. "It shows different views on the
clerics," La Jornada critic Leonardo Garcia Tsao said in a telephone
interview. "It is very well-rounded."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the audience members interviewed by the Mexico City
newspaper Reforma said Carlos Carrera's movie had a simple message:
Men of the cloth have weaknesses and the church has its own interests
to protect. The producers of "El Crimen del Padre Amaro" are in
negotiations with Sony Pictures, which distributed the film in Mexico
through its Buena Vista/Columbia Tristar partnership, for release of
the film in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Tainted Journalist Subject of New Movie</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Glass, whose journalism career took a dive after stories
he wrote for the New Republic, George and Rolling Stone magazines
were shown to contain fabrications, provides the inspiration for
"Shattered Glass," a movie being shot in Montreal this month.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a Vanity Fair story by former Philadelphia Inquirer

<TE>   Glass, then about 25, made headlines when it was revealed that he
had embellished a New Republic piece about computer hackers.
Researching his work, the magazine found that 27 of the 41 pieces
he'd written over the course of three years took liberties with the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Glass graduated from Georgetown Law School and worked

<TE>   Gallery Owners Sue Kinkade Estate</TE>
<TE>   Larry and Susan DiGiovanni, owners of Minneapolis' Twin Cities
Galleries, are trying to liquidate their inventory of works by Thomas
Kinkade, who describes himself as "the most collected living artist."</TE>
<TE>   What's the problem? The couple claims that Media Arts Group
Inc.--the artist's licensing agency--diluted the value of their
holdings by saturating the market and selling so much of his work on
TV's QVC cable shopping network.</TE>
<TE>   The couple has filed a lawsuit claiming that the company misled
and defrauded them of more than $1.3 million in life savings. Theirs
is one of about 10 suits filed by galleries across the country,
according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Martin, vice president of marketing for Media Arts, said that
the DiGiovannis' losses were triggered by bad business practices or
bad luck rather than by fraud. Most of the more than 300 Kinkade
galleries are doing well, he said.</TE>

<TE>   Tim Conway, Harvey Korman, the late John Frankenheimer, Bob
Mackie, Jean Stapleton and Bud Yorkin will be inducted into the
Television Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences' Hall of Fame at the Beverly
Hills Hotel on Nov. 6.... Steven Bochco ("NYPD Blue") is creating
another police drama--this time, a show following New York City cops
in the year 2069, for Fox Broadcasting.... Former Motley Crue member
Tommy Lee and his band will fill the void on the Ozzfest tour left by
Drowning Pool, the main-stage band whose lead singer was found dead
last week on a tour bus. Ozzfest arrives at the Glen Helen
Blockbuster Pavilion on Aug. 31. The investigation continues,
meanwhile, into the cause of death of Drowning Pool frontman Dave
Williams.</TE>

<HD>Exposing a Plague of Killings</HD>
<DH>Television* The haunting documentary 'Senorita Extraviada'
looks at the slayings of nearly 300 women in a Mexican city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They asked for it.</LD>
<LD>   That seemed to be the disturbing suggestion behind the first young
women who began to turn up, raped and murdered, in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico. If they had not worn miniskirts or gone to nightclubs,
authorities suggested, they would not have gotten into trouble. Some
even dismissed the victims as prostitutes.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, many were workers in the maquiladoras, the
light-assembly plants that are a mainstay of the new global economy
and rely on cheap female labor. Other victims were teenage
schoolgirls, mothers, a Sunday school teacher.</LD>
<TE>   Who is killing the young women of Ciudad Juarez? By now, the
bodies of some 270 young women, some with signs of torture, have been
dumped in the desert. And a growing wave of international scrutiny
has focused on the inability of the authorities to halt the killings
in this Mexican city across the border from El Paso, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco filmmaker Lourdes Portillo steps into this chilling
murder mystery with a haunting documentary, "Senorita Extraviada"
(Miss Missing), that will air on KCET-TV at 10 tonight. Portillo, a
veteran documentarian whose credits include the Oscar-nominated "Las
Madres: The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo," has already won a special
jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for "Senorita Extraviada."
She said she was drawn to the Ciudad Juarez murders by a sense of
outrage.</TE>
<TE>   "I found it astounding. I thought, 'My God, this is such an
injustice,' " said Portillo, 58. "How can anything like this have
been going for 10 years and not be stopped? These are schoolgirls,
from all walks of life."</TE>
<TE>   Supported by a Soros Foundation grant, and later, the MacArthur
Foundation, Portillo began to interview the relatives of the victims
in 1998. Their stories are searing: the father whose eyes fill with
tears as he tells of his daughter's ordeal; the brother who protected
his little sister from schoolyard bullies but lost her to murderers;
the mother whose daughter's killing brought back memories of her own
rape in the desert, years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The murdered women smile out from photographs, optimistic and
young, playing with their toddlers, or walking away from a factory in
the grainy footage of a security camera. "I wanted to tell the story
through the eyes of the victims," Portillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the filmmaker hears some disquieting allegations.
One woman, picked up by police and raped in jail, tells Portillo a
man walked into her cell and showed her photos of men raping and
killing women. Later, at a new factory job, this man turned up--as a
security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion of police involvement is one of a number of theories
that have arisen since the women's bodies began turning up in the
early 1990s. The victims tended to be young women, with
shoulder-length hair, who were sexually abused, strangled and dumped,
some with telltale markings carved into their backs. Some had been
asked to sit for "model" photographs at factories days before.</TE>
<TE>   Official ineptitude and insensitivity became legendary. In 1999,
then-Chihuahua Atty. Gen. Arturo Gonzalez Rascon suggested that the
victims' provocative clothing had aroused their attackers--attitudes
that critics viewed as a backlash against cultural shifts triggered
by female employment on the border.</TE>
<TE>   "Women have more freedom on the border," said Portillo, who was
born in Chihuahua and moved to the United States in 1960. "They can
wear a short skirt without their aunt saying it's too short. They're
being blamed for being modern. The women don't deserve to die because
they wear miniskirts."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested a group of gang members, but that failed to
halt the killings. In March 1999, a bloody, dirt-streaked 14-year-old
girl staggered out of the desert, saying she had been attacked by a
factory bus driver. Three bus drivers were arrested. Prosecutors said
an Egyptian already jailed as a murder suspect in 1995 paid the
drivers $1,200 a month to kill two women a month. But more recently,
a drug trafficker was arrested, reportedly wearing a woman's body
part on a chain.</TE>
<TE>   "The question remains," Portillo says, "who are the killers? The
Egyptian, the Rebels gang, the bus drivers, the police, the drug
traders or all of them?" The most formidable culprit, Portillo said,
may be impunity. During the documentary's 18-month production, 50
women were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "Opportunistic killers come and do the same thing, knowing there's
not going to be any punishment," she said. "My hope is to open
people's eyes and sensitize people to the plight of these girls."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing ordinary about the Millers--except, perhaps, the life
they lead.</LD>
<LD>   When Fritz and Cindy Miller of Soldotna, Alaska, learned in 1989
that their infant twins, Mariya and Michelle, had spinal muscular
atrophy, they wondered if the family could enjoy a normal life
together. But they didn't waste time worrying about it.</LD>
<LD>   The family rebuilt their home from the ground up, accommodating
the quadriplegic girls' special needs with a veritable funhouse of
wide ramps and open spaces. Because no commercial motorized
wheelchairs offered the kind of mobility these parents demanded for
their kids, the Millers and family friend Jim Van Sickle, a retired
engineer, designed and built turbocharged versions of their own in
the garage.</LD>
<TE>   That's the kind of tenacious spirit that sparks "Normal for Us:
The Miller Twins," a one-hour documentary at 9 tonight on KCET.</TE>
<TE>   If the girls have been sapped of much of their strength by a form
of muscular dystrophy, their souped-up chairs help give them the
power to lead as normal a life as possible.</TE>
<TE>   These gizmos, which the Millers rebuild and upgrade every couple
of years, handle more rocky terrain than most SUVs, allowing the
twins to zip around like other kids--with the skinned knees and
tattered shoes to prove it. A spinning function provides endless
hours of dizzy fun. A catapult lever allows the girls to fling
basketballs from half court, apparently with more accuracy than many
highly paid NBA veterans.</TE>
<TE>   For Mariya and Michelle, who go to a regular public school,
getting teased is not the problem. What they have to watch out for,
they say, is so-called friends who only like them for their chairs.</TE>
<TE>   It's a price worth paying. As any kid knows, the only thing better
than being normal is being cool.</TE>

<HD>SEC Says AOL Certified Results</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday that it accepted
signed certifications by top executives at AOL Time Warner Inc. of
the company's 2001 and 2002 financial reports.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's action boosted shares of the media giant, which has
acknowledged that its accounting practices are under investigation by
the SEC and the Justice Department. AOL Time Warner's stock rose 77
cents to $13.33 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC uses an Internet site to keep a running tally of the
certification status of the 947 major corporations, AOL Time Warner
included, whose chief executives and chief financial officers are
required to attest under oath to the accuracy and completeness of
their companies' 2001 and first-half 2002 financial statements.</LD>
<TE>   The certification requirement was adopted this year in response to
the accounting scandals that have spawned dozens of investigations
and led to the bankruptcy filings of firms such as Enron Corp. and
WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   On its Web site, the SEC indicated that its inspectors had
verified that the company's certification documents had been received
and were in the proper format, spokeswoman Christi Harlan said.</TE>
<TE>   The documents were submitted on the Aug. 14 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day, AOL Time Warner disclosed that an internal
investigation had disclosed that three transactions totaling $49
million may have been improperly booked as "advertising and commerce
revenue" within its America Online unit.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that SEC and Justice
Department lawyers were probing "dozens" of America Online
transactions, some of which may have involved "round-tripping," an
illegal practice used to artificially boost reported revenue.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner executives did not return calls for comment
Monday.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Adopts Reforms on Conflicts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Employees' Retirement System adopted reforms at
the urging of state Treasurer Philip Angelides that will require
banks to root out potential conflicts of interest if they want to do
business with the largest U.S. pension fund.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS, which manages about $140 billion, also said it will give
"significant consideration" to the reforms in hiring money managers
to pick stocks and bonds on its behalf, though it won't necessarily
make the reforms a condition of hiring.</LD>
<LD>   Investors, regulators and lawmakers have stepped up calls for
reform after the bankruptcy filings of Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.,
which cost pension funds billions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   New York and North Carolina and the California State Teachers
Retirement System were the first pension funds to adopt measures to
change corporate practices in July.</TE>
<TE>   The states want brokers and money managers to adopt the
conflict-of-interest rules Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to in a May
settlement with New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who accused
Merrill of producing biased stock research.</TE>
<TE>   The principles call for brokerages to separate analyst pay from
investment banking revenue, create a committee to review and approve
all stock recommendations and for brokerages to disclose whether they
have been paid by companies they research.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides, who sits on the CalPERS board, has asked brokerage
firms to state that they plan to comply by the rules by Sept. 15 and
to provide details about how they will enforce the guidelines by
December.</TE>
<TE>   Ted White, CalPERS director of corporate governance, said the
staff will send a copy of the guidelines to money managers asking
them how they would comply.</TE>

<HD>CKE Reports Sluggish Sales</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: Analysts say the owner of Carl's Jr. and
Hardee's chains needs another hit like the Six Dollar Burger to boost
its performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CKE Restaurants Inc.'s turnaround appears to have hit a bump as sales
at restaurants open at least a year, a key industry measure, fell at
its Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chains.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara-based company said Monday that same-store sales
at Carl's fell by 3% in the four weeks ended Aug. 12, versus a 6.8%
jump for the same period a year earlier. Hardee's sales dropped 2.8%,
compared with a 1.3% hike.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Andy Puzder warned in a release that although the
Carl's brand remains strong, its future same-store sales are expected
to fluctuate because of comparisons against last year's strong
performance.</LD>
<TE>   To attain comparable sales growth, the chains must come up with a
hit product on the magnitude of the Six Dollar Burger, said Mary
Gilbert, an analyst with Imperial Capital in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to be able to sustain that level of growth without
coming up with another strong product introduction," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A premium sandwich that actually costs $3.95, the heavily promoted
Six Dollar Burger has fueled growth at Carl's since its introduction
last June and at Hardee's since its appearance in November.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Lacey, CKE's chief financial officer, said Carl's and
Hardee's plan to roll out new products in the late fall. He declined
to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Although disappointed by the decline in same-store sales, Lacey
said he is heartened by the growth of gross margins at Hardee's,
which is expected to come in at 12.3% or more for the quarter ended
Aug. 12, more than a 20% increase. He attributed Hardee's margin
growth to an increased emphasis on premium products such as the Six
Dollar Burger and chicken-breast strips.</TE>
<TE>   CKE shares lost 35 cents Monday to close at $6.85 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than 24% of its value since
the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Like other burger chains, CKE faces cutthroat competition in the
fast-food industry, said Janet Lowder, president of Restaurant
Management Services in Rancho Palos Verdes. Recently, Burger King
unveiled a slew of successful menu items, including the Chicken
Whopper, and Taco Bell has just rolled out chicken and beef bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to CKE's difficulties, burger sales are soggy. Consumers
are increasingly flocking to fresher, healthier fare offered by
fast-casual chains such as Baja Fresh, Panda Express and Panera Bread
Co.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, hamburger sales hit nearly $47 billion, only a 2.7%
increase compared with a year earlier. By contrast, the $269-billion
restaurant industry grew 4.5%, according to Technomic Inc., a
restaurant research and consulting firm in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   CKE has taken important steps to position the chain for future
success, CFO Lacey said. The company has paid off about $300 million
in bank debt over the last two years. CKE has closed 40 unprofitable
Carl's and 300 underperforming Hardee's since 1999, he said. To
improve food quality, charbroilers have been installed at most
Hardee's.</TE>

<HD>Veteran to Lead Clear Channel's Radio Division</HD>
<DH>Media: John Hogan will succeed his former boss, Randy
Michaels, as chief executive in what sources say is a bid to ease
relations with record labels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entertainment conglomerate Clear Channel Communications Inc. plans to
appoint John Hogan as chief executive of its sprawling radio division
today, making him one of the most powerful figures in the radio
industry, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment of Hogan as head of the 1,200-station operation,
the nation's biggest, had been expected. He will succeed Randy
Michaels, the often controversial radio chief who stepped down last
month.</LD>
<LD>   Hogan, 45, spearheaded the company's development this year of a
specialized sales unit to push advertisers to commit to broad deals
across Clear Channel's diverse assets, which include radio stations,
concert venues and billboards. Before becoming the division's
president and chief operating officer in August 2001, Hogan oversaw
Clear Channel operations in radio markets such as Los Angeles,
Atlanta, Houston and Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   Clear Channel is not expected to name a replacement for Hogan, who
likely will move to San Antonio where Clear Channel is headquartered,
sources said. But it was unclear whether the conglomerate's top
programming officials, based in Covington, Ky., would be asked to
relocate there. Also unclear was whether Clear Channel would continue
to program its stations with "brand managers" overseeing various
music formats--a structure developed by Michaels.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders say the appointment of Hogan, who worked as Michael's
deputy and has little programming experience, is part of an effort by
Clear Channel President Mark P. Mays to take more of a role in the
day-to-day operation of the $3-billion-a-year radio division, Clear
Channel's biggest.</TE>
<TE>   Last month Mays helped engineer the exit of Michaels, who stepped
down to run a newly created internal think tank focusing on wireless
and broadband technology. His departure from the job came as the Mays
family had grown uncomfortable with Michaels' management style.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels long had been a controversial figure in the radio and
music industries, in part because of his flamboyant public
appearances and occasional confrontations with record executives. But
Michaels was credited in the last three years with orchestrating
Clear Channel's consolidation of radio stations and with developing a
national pop radio format. His exit sent Clear Channel's stock
plunging.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan takes the reins at a time when the company is battling
congressional critics who say it engages in anti-competitive
practices, capitalizes on regulatory loopholes and skirts anti-payola
laws by cutting deals with independent record promoters paid by major
record labels to get airplay. Critics also say the company has
leveraged its massive holdings in stations and concert venues to
squeeze competitors and prevent artists from appearing at rival
stations or concerts.</TE>
<TE>   A source said Monday that Hogan's mandate includes taking a
"kinder, gentler" approach in dealing with record labels.</TE>
<TE>   A Clear Channel spokesperson declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel's shares closed Monday at $32.50, up $1.93, on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Leading Index Drops in July on Stock Slump</HD>
<DH>Economy: Conference Board's gauge declines 0.4%, but the
decrease is smaller than expected. Some analysts see positive signs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILL EDWARDS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. index of leading economic indicators fell in July, pulled
down by stock market declines and a drop in consumer optimism,
according to a report released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board's index, a gauge of the economy's performance
over the next three to six months, declined 0.4% last month, after
falling 0.2% in June. The decline was the largest since a 0.6% drop
10 months ago, when terrorists attacked New York and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks gained after July's drop in the leading indicators was
smaller than expected and retailers including Lowe's Cos. reported
improved results. Lowe's said it had a 42% rise in second-quarter
profit.</LD>
<TE>   Stocks contributed the most to the index's decline in July, but
they have rebounded this month and consumer confidence has leveled
off. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 21.93 points, or 2%, to
950.70 on Monday, the highest since July 9.</TE>
<TE>   Although the recent rise in stocks and strength in retail sales
are positive signs, the economy's recovery remains sluggish.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic growth in the second half will be slower than people
were expecting," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC
Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.1% annual pace in the
second quarter, down from a 5% growth rate in the first three months
of the year, and an increasing number of economists expect growth to
stay slow for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "The latest reading was heavily skewed by a big drop in the stock
market, which isn't going down in August," said Ken Goldstein, a
Conference Board economist. "Unless the shoe drops somewhere else,
we're going to continue to muddle through."</TE>
<TE>   The leading index has fallen in three of the last four months and
risen only once since February. Six of the 10 indicators tracked by
the Conference Board pushed down the July index.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based research group bases its index on seven
previously reported economic statistics and on estimates for three
others.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to falling stocks and consumer confidence, negative
contributions came from a drop in factory hours worked, a decline in
building permits, a narrower spread between the yield on 10-year
Treasury notes and the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate, and
faster supplier deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Positive contributors to the index were a rise in the money
supply, fewer jobless claims and increased orders for capital and
consumer goods.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's index of coincident indicators, a measure
of current economic activity, rose 0.1% last month after a 0.3%
increase in June.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in nonfarm payrolls, industrial production, manufacturing
and wholesale sales, and personal income excluding Social Security
and other transfer payments make up the index.</TE>

<HD>Layton-Belling Seeks Industrial Sites</HD>
<DH>The company will buy about $180 million worth of properties
in an effort to create a portfolio that will produce a steady cash
flow from rent payments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Beach real estate firm Layton-Belling &amp; Associates plans to
buy about $180 million worth of Southern California industrial
properties through its latest investment fund.</LD>
<LD>   LBA Industrial Fund I, backed mostly by institutional investors,
just acquired two multi-tenant complexes in Orange County for about
$32 million, said Steve Briggs, the fund's portfolio manager. The
fund will continue buying well-occupied, high-quality industrial
buildings over the next year and a half, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The managers' strategy is to assemble a portfolio of stable,
well-located properties that produce steady cash flow from rents.
There is strong demand for such buildings from tenants and other
investors, Briggs said, so there is a good chance rents and property
values will appreciate before the fund sells the portfolio in about
seven years.</LD>
<TE>   Targeted property types include distribution, light-manufacturing
and multi-tenant business parks costing between $5 million and $30
million, primarily in the thriving industrial core of central Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The fund has acquired two warehouse and light-manufacturing
complexes: the 215,682-square-foot Canyon Corporate Center in Anaheim
and a 268,612-square-foot facility at 2100 E. Valencia Drive in
Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Layton-Belling's previous funds targeted office and industrial
properties that needed improvements and could grow in value with
capital investments and better management, founding principal Phil
Belling said. The industrial funds will be less risky and hence
aren't expected to generate returns as high as those achieved by the
firm's so-called opportunity funds.</TE>
<TE>   A cross-section of institutional and individual investors joined
Layton-Belling principals to pool nearly $80 million to create the
fund, Belling said. By taking advantage of today's historically low
interest rates, fund managers anticipate they will be able to buy
about $180 million worth of real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial rents continued to fall during the second quarter in
certain markets such as south Orange County, according to brokerage
Colliers Seeley. Activity has picked up in other areas including the
western Inland Empire and San Gabriel Valley. Rents have generally
flattened, but sales prices have typically continued to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Colliers Seeley also reports plenty of investor competition for
quality industrial properties. Though few such assets are listed for
sale, numerous buyers armed with low-cost financing are scouring the
Los Angeles Basin in search of acquisition opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Layton-Belling, which will manage the fund's properties, acquired
more than $1 billion worth of Southern California real estate over
the last seven years, primarily through its investment funds. More
than one-third of the activity has been in the industrial category.</TE>

<HD>Lowe's Net Income Up 42%; Toys R Us Loss Beats Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHOBHANA CHANDRA and ANDRIA CHENG</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WILKESBORO, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Second-quarter earnings for Lowe's Cos. surged 42% as the nation's
second-largest home-improvement retailer expanded into big cities and
controlled expenses.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Toys R Us Inc. reported a narrower loss that
beat forecasts, as the No. 2 toy retailer controlled inventory, cut
costs, remodeled stores and boosted sales of traditional toys.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe's said net income increased to $467 million, or 59 cents a
share, from $329.1 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier, spurred by
22 new stores that helped boost sales by more than a fifth. Sales
climbed 22% to $7.49 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 2. Analysts on
average had forecast earnings of 54 cents at Lowe's, according to
Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   The better-than-expected results sent shares of both retailers
soaring and helped lift other U.S. stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe's key, according to analysts, is that it is opening
more-profitable stores in larger cities, such as Boston, to compete
directly with bigger rival Home Depot Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Toys R Us, which said its loss narrowed to $17 million as it saved
money by combining departments and administrative functions, is
revamping its stores to make shopping easier and to woo customers
from rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not experiencing the collapse in consumer spending that
some have predicted," Lowe's Chief Executive Robert Tillman said in a
conference call. "Consumers view home improvement as synonymous with
home investment."</TE>
<TE>   Sales at stores open at least a year increased 6.8%. Same-store
sales at Home Depot, which is scheduled to release quarterly results
today, may rise to the low end of its forecast for gains of 2% to 4%,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe's also boosted its annual profit forecast to as much as $1.75
a share. Analysts on average had forecast $1.70.</TE>
<TE>   Toys R Us reported a net loss of 8 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $29 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 2.4% to
$2.07 billion in the period ended Aug. 3.</TE>
<TE>   On average, analysts were expecting a loss of 11 cents a share,
according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The retailer said it trimmed advertising spending on concern that
sales may slow as the economy falters. The company also canceled some
seasonal orders to avoid being stuck with merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of traditional, or core, toys, including learning and

<HD>Stocks Continue Recent Surge With Broad Rally</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow climbs 212.73 points as investors
disregard weak economic data and focus on positive retail news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks continued their recent surge Monday, rallying broadly as
investors shrugged off sluggish economic data and focused on positive
retail news.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 212.73 points, or 2.4%, to
8,990.79 despite a report by the Conference Board that its index of
leading U.S. economic indicators fell in July for the second straight
month.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a surprising reaction by the stock market," said Gary
Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Capital Management in San
Francisco. "The specter of a 'double dip' recession looks that much
more real, although I still think we can avoid it."</LD>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 21.93 points, or
2.4%, to 950.70, increasing the gain from its July 23 low to 19.2%.
The technology-oriented Nasdaq composite index rose 33.53 points, or
2.5%, to 1,394.54.</TE>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are coming off four straight positive
weeks, and Nasdaq has a two-week winning streak, boosting hopes that
the 2 1/2-year-long bear market might have reached its end last
month. But if the economy sinks back into recession, stocks could
tumble below the multiyear lows reached during the summer sell-off,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Schlossberg said traders may have been relieved that the index of
leading indicators slipped less than forecast, even though it was the
first consecutive monthly decline since April-May 2001. The index
sagged 0.4 point to 111.7, versus expectations of a 0.5-point drop.</TE>
<TE>   Also, much of the index's decline came from its component that
tracks stock market performance. The S&amp;P 500 was down 7.9% last
month, but with the recent rally, that negative effect on the economy
may be fading a bit, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to falling stocks, negative contributors included
declining consumer confidence, a drop in factory hours worked, a
decline in building permits and a narrower spread between the yield
on 10-year Treasury notes and the Fed's benchmark overnight lending
rate.</TE>
<TE>   Positive contributors to the index were a rise in the money
supply, fewer jobless claims, and increased orders for capital and
consumer goods.</TE>
<TE>   Strong earnings reports Monday from home products retailer Lowe's
and toy seller Toys R Us bolstered investor confidence that U.S.
consumers can keep the economy out of recession, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe's surged $4.21 to $41 after saying second-quarter sales and
earnings rose sharply; Toys R Us gained $1.08 to $13.90 after noting
a narrower-than-expected loss in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are ignoring the soft economic data and focusing on
company news," Schlossberg said.</TE>
<TE>   More retail earnings reports expected this week, including one
today from Home Depot, will offer better guidance about the strength
of the consumer, said Russ Koesterich, U.S. equity strategist at
State Street Global Advisors in Boston. Home Deport shares rose 93
cents to $29.03 on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Noting the day's modest overall volume, Koesterich said he
believes the market has been "moving based on momentum, not
fundamentals."</TE>
<TE>   Semiconductor equipment stocks continued their recent rally
despite a report from Deutsche Bank analysts warning that earnings in
the sector could weaken in the coming months, Koesterich said. A
report from brokerage UBS Warburg cutting its S&amp;P 500 profit
estimates for this year and next "went virtually unnoticed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the chip sector, Micron Technology rose $1.28 to $22.13, Xylinx
gained $1.28 to $22.24, Applied Materials added 77 cents to $15.47
and Advanced Micro Devices climbed 57 cents to $10.50.</TE>
<TE>   In the Treasury market, yields fell for the first time in four
sessions as traders reacted to the weak economic data. The yield on
the benchmark 10-year T-note eased to 4.28% from 4.32% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the dollar surged against the yen after Standard
&amp; Poor's said it may cut Japan's credit rating. The greenback also
strengthened against the euro as U.S. stocks rose.</TE>
<TE>   Gold futures plummeted $7.70 to $306 an ounce in New York trading
as investors, emboldened by a steadier tone on Wall Street, ditched
safe-haven investments and moved funds into U.S. stocks.</TE>
<TE>   In foreign stock trading, Japan's Nikkei-225 slid 1.9%, but key
indexes rose 4.2% in Germany, 3.5% in France and 2.2% in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Big stocks helping to lead the rally included General Electric,
up $1.34 to $32.89; Microsoft, up $2 to $52; Pfizer, up 95 cents to
$34.07; and Alcoa, up $1.34 to $26.11.</TE>
<TE>   * In the retail sector, Circuit City climbed $1.13 to $15.86,
Target gained $1.26 to $36.80 and Wal-Mart Stores rose 90 cents to
$54.69.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks also helped lift the market, including J.P.
Morgan Chase, up $2.35 to $27.21; Citigroup, up $1.45 to $36.35;
Merrill Lynch, up $1.77 to $37.86; and insurer AIG, up $2.91 to
$67.91.</TE>
<TE>   * In the energy sector, Dynegy rose 60 cents to $2.29 after
completing its sale of a natural gas pipeline, which investors hope
will help the company ward off a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   * EarthLink gained 56 cents to $6.63 after it said it will offer
free software that blocks pop-up ads.</TE>

<HD>Home Buyers Turning to Interest-Only Loans</HD>
<DH>Real estate: As prices surge, mortgages that allow lower
payments gain popularity. Experts warn of risks later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A growing number of consumers are betting that home values will
continue to appreciate as they take on mortgages that sharply lower
their monthly payments but require them to shoulder far more risk.</LD>
<LD>   Interest-only mortgages have surged, particularly in California,
as prices spike and mortgage rates plunge. The loans, which once were
aimed at a small pool of affluent borrowers, have gone mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   At Washington Mutual Inc., the nation's largest residential
lender, such mortgages have accounted for roughly $1 billion a month
since being introduced last summer. As mortgage rates fell to the
lowest levels in decades, the loans were the most requested of all
categories, said Gregory Sayegh, a senior vice president in the
Irvine office.</LD>
<TE>   "We've seen a dramatic shift over the past 30 days," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This type of mortgage, designed for buyers who intend to live in
their homes for less than the length of the loan, allows borrowers to
make lower payments than a traditional mortgage because none of the
monthly payment goes toward the principal. Interest rates generally
are up to 1 percentage point lower than fixed-rate mortgages, and the
full payment is tax-deductible.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, payments on a 30-year interest-only mortgage at 5.5% on
a $500,000 home would be set at $2,292 a month, compared with a fixed
loan at $2,839. That represents a monthly savings of $547.</TE>
<TE>   After five years, when repayment of the interest-only mortgage
typically converts to an adjustable rate for the last 25 years of the
loan, the borrower could have saved about $33,000, which might be
used to pay for a child's education or to invest in other ways.</TE>
<TE>   In a traditional mortgage, part of each payment is applied to the
principal of the loan. Using the same example, a borrower after five
years would have accumulated about $38,000 in equity, which also
could be tapped for other uses through another loan.</TE>
<TE>   "The question the consumer has to ask is: Am I further ahead [with
an interest-only loan] rather than having the money sit in equity?"
said Brad Blackwell, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   No group tracks the use of the loans. But Blackwell said
interest-only loans, though they make up only about 5% of overall
volume at Wells Fargo, are rapidly gaining in popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "What's driving demand is that people are saying, 'I don't know if
I'll be in the house for three to seven years. Why pay a higher rate
of interest to lock in a rate for 30 years when I know my
circumstance will be changing?' " said Craig Cole, a senior vice
president at Union Bank of California, where use of interest-only
loans also has soared.</TE>
<TE>   But the loans could leave borrowers worse off if home values
should stop rising or decline. At the end of the interest-only
period, generally five to 10 years, consumers could be left owing
more than the home is worth.</TE>
<TE>   Even if prices keep appreciating, analysts said, borrowers may
need to refinance to more-favorable terms when the loan's interest
rate becomes adjustable.</TE>
<TE>   Interest-only loans, which have been around for about a decade,
generally appeal to wealthy buyers who need large loans to purchase
expensive homes. Those borrowers usually know they plan to move into
another home or to refinance before the loan is repaid.</TE>
<TE>   The loans now are pitched to a broader audience as a way to buy
more house for the money and to offset rising prices.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is talking about the risks," said Keith Gumbinger, an
analyst at HSH Inc., a New Jersey firm that tracks the mortgage
market.</TE>
<TE>   "Markets do turn around and turn around uncomfortably, and not
paying equity on a home means a borrower will still owe a lot of
money down the road."</TE>
<TE>   But many borrowers have found an interest-only loan too good to
pass up. A similar product based on the concept also is gaining
considerable steam as a method to purchase homes. Borrowers pay only
interest on a line of credit for 10 years that can be used like a
checkbook to pay off the home or to make other purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell said California accounts for about 40% of the national
market at Wells Fargo for super-jumbo interest-only loans. With rates
now in the mid-4% range for such loans, Blackwell predicted that the
concept would draw "more and more people."*</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Weigh the Risks Before Applying</TE>
<TE>   Interest-only loans are suitable for some borrowers, but they're
not for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   The loans are intended for those with top credit, a strong cash
flow and a willingness to refinance or move when the interest-only
period ends.</TE>
<TE>   Before applying for such a loan, be sure to understand the risks:</TE>
<TE>   * None of the monthly payment counts toward the actual cost of the
home. At the end of the interest-only period, the borrower still owes
the full amount of the original loan.</TE>
<TE>   * If property values decline, the borrower could owe the lender
more than the home is worth.</TE>
<TE>   But such home loans have certain advantages:</TE>
<TE>   * Monthly payments are smaller than in traditional mortgages. Some
borrowers use the savings for other investments.</TE>
<TE>   * The entire payment is tax deductible.</TE>

<LD>AstraZeneca, Europe's second-largest drug maker, said its lung cancer
pill Iressa didn't help patients live longer when added to standard
chemotherapy. The news sent the company's shares tumbling 12%, a
record drop for AstraZeneca.</LD>
<LD>   Iressa is the most advanced of a class of experimental cancer
drugs called epidermal-growth factor-receptor inhibitors. The study
results raised concerns about the prospects for this group of drugs,
which is similar to medicines being developed by U.S. companies. As a
result, shares of OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc., ImClone Systems Inc. and
Abgenix Inc. also went down.</LD>
<LD>   OSI fell $18.74, or 57%, to $14.05 on Nasdaq, the biggest
percentage decliner on U.S. markets. ImClone fell 98 cents, or 11%,
to $8.26 and Abgenix fell $1.95, or 20%, to $7.89.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. is suing Tribune Co. and Knight Ridder Inc. for more than
$31 million, alleging that the media giants defaulted on contracts
related to the price of newsprint.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies terminated multiyear agreements early, the lawsuit
alleges, and therefore must pay termination fees plus amounts equal
to the estimated remaining value of the contracts, based on current
newsprint prices.</LD>
<LD>   Enron said that Chicago-based Tribune owes $22.9 million and that
San Jose-based Knight Ridder owes $8.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   The media companies stopped making payments shortly after Enron
revealed questionable accounting practices and filed for bankruptcy
protection in December.</TE>
<TE>   Knight Ridder did not return a call seeking comment. A spokesman
for Enron said the company would not comment on the lawsuits. A
spokeswoman for Tribune, owner of The Times, said the company does
not comment on pending litigation.</TE>

<HD>Continental Recalls Ford SUV Tires</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continental Tire North America announced that it is recalling more
than half a million tires installed on Ford Motor Co. sport utility
vehicles after some of the tires lost their tread.</LD>
<LD>   Tread separations led to the recall of millions of Firestone tires
in the last two years that were used primarily on the Ford Explorer.
Ford officials said they discovered the Continental problem through a
process put in place after the Firestone recall to quickly identify
possible tire defects.</LD>
<LD>   The recalled Continental tires were installed as original
equipment on 106,701 two-wheel-drive Ford Expedition and Lincoln
Navigator SUVs from the 2000 and 2001 model years. About 60,000
additional tires were sold as replacements on light trucks, for a
total of 596,610.</LD>
<TE>   The recall involves the P275/60R17 size of the ContiTrac AW and
General Grabber AW tires. Those involved in the recall have
Transportation Department codes that end with numbers ranging from

<HD>Oil Prices Jump as Kuwait Sees No Changes by OPEC</HD>
<DH>Energy: Rally extends last week's increase that came on
fears of a possible military strike by the United States against
Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surging oil prices hit 15-month highs just below $30 a barrel Monday
as Kuwait said it did not expect the OPEC cartel to ease supply curbs
despite falling U.S. stocks and fears of military conflict in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Oil traders had expected OPEC ministers meeting in Japan next
month to loosen tough production limits as crude prices are nearing
pain levels for Western consumer nations and demand normally balloons
in the last quarter of the year.</LD>
<LD>   At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for September
delivery rose 51 cents to $29.84 a barrel, its highest close since
May 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The day's rally extended a rise of more than $2 last week that
came on fears of a possible military strike by the United States
against Iraq and on a steep slide in U.S. crude oil stockpiles to the
lowest levels in 17 months.</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has held
official production levels at the lowest level for a decade this
year, helping to push crude prices up almost 50% despite sluggish
fuel demand in a downbeat economy.</TE>
<TE>   Middle East-dominated OPEC, which controls two-thirds of world
exports, meets on Sept. 19 to chart output policy for the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwait's acting oil minister, Sheik Ahmed al Fahd al Sabah, said
Monday that he did not expect the OPEC cartel to raise output unless
the price of its basket of crudes went above $28 per barrel. OPEC's
export price stood at $26.58 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Rothman, oil analyst at investment bank Merrill Lynch, said
he expected OPEC to sanction higher output levels.</TE>
<TE>   "Our view is that prices are approaching levels making both
producing and large consuming nations uncomfortable," said Rothman.
"We sense that the pieces are in place for OPEC to formally implement
quota hikes sooner rather than later."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer governments, led by the White House, fear that prices
above $30 for U.S. crude could hit growth and endanger the tentative
global recovery. A White House spokesman said Monday that President
Bush had no plans to tap into the nation's emergency oil stockpile,
despite the recent price spike.</TE>
<TE>   "The reserves are meant for times of emergency," White House press
secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, the world's largest oil consumer, has called on
OPEC to raise flows by 1 million barrels a day from October to avoid
a price spike this winter.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC is cautious about raising supply too soon and jeopardizing a
three-year oil price boom that has generated windfall revenues to its
governments.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect strong gasoline demand to make another dent in
U.S. crude stocks when the industry group American Petroleum
Institute releases its inventory report today.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were divided on whether U.S. crude-oil inventories rose
or fell last week, after the American Petroleum Institute reported
the biggest decline in 14 months the week before, a Bloomberg survey
showed.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates from nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey ranged from a
decline of 3.5 million barrels to an increase of 5 million. Supplies
plunged 9.5 million barrels to 295.6 million the previous week.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in inventories during the week ended Aug. 9 was the
biggest since the week ended June 8, 2001, and pushed supplies to
their lowest level since March 2001, the institute said last Tuesday.
Supplies were 3.8% lower than a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Company Directors See Rising Salaries</HD>
<DH>Workplace: Pay rose 11% while CEOs' increased 6.9%. Outside
members may be offered more amid corporate scrutiny.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMY HELLICKSON</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Directors of U.S. companies saw their compensation rise about 11%
last year and they can look forward to higher pay growth as they face
greater scrutiny after this season of corporate scandals, according
to a study released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Pay for chief executives, meanwhile, increased 6.9%, the smallest
increase in at least a decade, to $7.04 million, according to the
survey of 350 large companies conducted by Mercer Human Resources
Consulting. Excluding stock options, annual pay for CEOs fell 2.8% to
about $1.6 million in 2001, the study said.</LD>
<LD>   The accounting scandals at Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and other
companies have put outside directors under increased pressure to
ensure that executives aren't improperly boosting earnings to protect
the value of their stock incentives.</LD>
<TE>   Compensation for outside directors in 2001 was $115,687 in fees,
options and other stock pay, up 11% from 2000. That's up 48% since
1997, as companies have given more options and stock to align
directors' interests with those of investors. Median pay for outside
directors exceeded $100,000 for the first time in 2000, rising 6.8%
to $104,439 from $97,750 in 1999, and then surged last year, Mercer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of board members are "becoming increasingly wary of
the risks involved in board service," said Peter Oppermann, a senior
executive compensation consultant at Mercer. "The current rash of
problems will make it harder for companies to attract good directors
in the future."</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are going to have to pay more to get the level of
competency they need on boards," said Judith Fischer, managing
director of Executive Compensation Advisory Services in the
Washington suburb of Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Directors "are certainly in the limelight now, and they're taking
on more fiduciary responsibilities," Fischer said. "Their toes are to
the fire."</TE>
<TE>   With legal risks and workloads increasing and stock prices down
from highs of 2000, companies are planning to increase cash pay for
directors, according to Oppermann.</TE>
<TE>   Stock has accounted for an ever larger share of board members'
compensation over the last half decade, rising each year from 44% in
1997 to 59% last year, the Mercer study found. Oppermann said
companies are aiming for a 50-50 mix between stock and cash.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the directors' 2001 pay raise came from increases in
stock-derived compensation, according to the Mercer study. The
figures for last year, derived from proxy statements of 350 companies
with median annual sales of $6.2 billion, do not yet reflect
increases stemming from new responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Mercer found computer-and data-service providers gave the biggest
pay packages, worth $238,494. Computers and office equipment makers
followed with $225,724. Retailing was the lowest-paying industry,
with a median of $94,145, trailing industrial and farm equipment
companies with $95,984.</TE>
<TE>   The average board has 11 members, including two executives and
nine people from outside the company.</TE>
<TE>   Those outside board members were the subject of the survey. The
average workload last year was eight full board meetings, plus
committee work, according to Mercer.</TE>

<HD>Qwest to Sell Directories Business for $7 Billion</HD>
<DH>Telecommunications: A group led by Carlyle and Welsh Carson
is reportedly the buyer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. is selling its directories
operation to a group led by Carlyle Group Inc. and Welsh, Carson,
Anderson &amp; Stowe for $7.05 billion, Dow Jones Newswires said, citing
the Wall Street Journal.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts have valued the Yellow Pages business of Qwest, the
biggest local telephone company in 14 states, at as much as $10
billion.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is expected to be the largest leveraged buyout since
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989 for
$25 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Qwest spokesman Tyler Gronbach had no comment about the sale.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified sources, said the
deal would call for Qwest to sell the eastern half of its directories
business first for $2.75 billion, which includes directories in
Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota and
North Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said that Qwest would sell the western half for $4.3
billion in six to 12 months, pending regulatory approvals. The
western portion includes operations in Arizona, Idaho, Montana,
Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal, on its Web site, said Carlyle and Welsh Carson would
each contribute $750 million in equity.</TE>
<TE>   The sale is expected to be announced today.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest has been under heavy pressure to sell QwestDex or other
assets to unload some of its $26.6 billion in debt. Under its bank
covenants, debt can be no more than 4.25 times its earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That ratio falls to 4
by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, Qwest offered more details of its second-quarter
results and said it expects to restate revenue while working with its
new auditor, KPMG, to restate financial results from 2000 and part of
2001.</TE>
<TE>   According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company was renegotiating its agreements with lenders. Qwest said
it needs to amend the agreement or get a waiver from its banks before
Sept. 30 or it would violate its financial covenants by the end of
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the second quarter is down $903 million from the same
period last year, with revenue for the second quarter at $4.3
billion. The company attributed the decline to a weak economy, a drop
in long-distance business, a decrease in optical capacity sales and
the loss of 687,000 access lines.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest has said it was reviewing optical capacity sales, equipment
sales, publication schedules of its phone directories and services
from other telecom companies that it believes may have been
improperly recorded.</TE>
<TE>   Some employees were disciplined for improperly recording equipment
sales, but Qwest spokesman Chris Hardman would not say which
employees or discuss consequences.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Qwest started booking directory revenue when the
directories were published, instead of over the life of the
directory.</TE>
<TE>   It said Arthur Andersen, the auditor at the time, signed off on
that method, but KPMG advised Qwest to change the practice and
account for the directories over time.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Qwest rose 31 cents to $2.24 on Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange but fell 15 cents in extended trading.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advanced Micro Devices Inc. landed its first deal for a top-tier U.S.
personal-computer maker to use AMD chips in a PC aimed at the
business market.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett-Packard Co. said that it's selling a Compaq-branded PC
powered by AMD Athlon XP processors. The PC model is aimed at the
small-and medium-business market as well as the government and
education markets.</LD>
<LD>   The HP deal shows how far Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD has come
since introducing the Athlon processor in 1999, analysts said. AMD
has at times been written off as an also-ran behind mighty Intel
Corp., while at other times earning praise as a scrappy competitor.</LD>

<HD>Apple Receives Emmy for Video Editing Tool</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apple Computer Inc. has won its second Primetime Emmy Award for
engineering in two years, getting recognition for the widespread
adoption of its Final Cut Pro video editing tool.</LD>
<LD>   The software retails for about $1,000 and allows users to
manipulate content in a number of formats with the ease once
available only on machines costing tens of thousands of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   "Before it was mostly a consumer product, but now it's evolved
into a professional product that is used by many networks and is
really a cutting-edge choice for editing on a budget," said Cristy
Trembly, co-chair of the engineering awards committee for the Academy
of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. Last year, Apple won for its FireWire
wireless connectivity system for home networks, which is now an open
industry standard.</LD>
<TE>   Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who also heads animation
technology powerhouse Pixar Inc., said the award validates the
Silicon Valley computer firm's emphasis on media functions in its
machines.</TE>
<TE>   "We think computers will be the hub of the digital lifestyle, for
consumers and also pros," Jobs said. "To use a digital camera and an
MP3 player, you need a computer. There will be more and more devices
like that."</TE>

<HD>AOL May Buy AT&amp;T's Share of Entertainment Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. is poised to simplify one of its most complex
business units by buying out AT&amp;T Corp.'s stake in Time Warner
Entertainment for $9 billion in cash, AOL stock and shares in a new
publicly traded cable business, people familiar with the situation
said.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, expected as early as today, would give AOL Time Warner
full ownership of Warner Bros. studios and cable networks HBO, Court
TV and Comedy Central, and could help bolster AOL stock by showing
investors that the company is serious about cleaning house.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides were still haggling over the key issue of AOL
gaining access to AT&amp;T's cable networks, and an announcement on that
aspect of the deal might not come for several more days, people
familiar with the negotiations said. AT&amp;T is selling its cable
business to Comcast Corp., and it is unclear whether the access deal
would include Comcast's networks. Neither AT&amp;T nor AOL and Comcast
would comment.</LD>
<TE>   Although AOL Time Warner's payments for TWE would dampen its 2003
earnings by a few cents a share and possibly threaten its credit
rating, the media company would benefit by eliminating the headache
of TWE, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "A TWE restructuring should remove a strategic overhang and a
cloud of uncertainty around AOL Time Warner's stock. In addition, a
deal probably would simplify the capital structure," JP Morgan
analyst Jason Bazinet said in a research report.</TE>
<TE>   Securing access to AT&amp;T's networks is important because it would
give AOL a much-needed pipeline for high-speed Internet access and
its cable channels and would help convince cable operators it is not
an adversary.</TE>
<TE>   The complex TWE agreement would end more than two years of
negotiations, which languished amid disagreements over price, the
venture's complex mix of businesses, and the two partners' own
financial constraints.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, AT&amp;T would receive about $2 billion in
cash and about $1.5 billion in AOL common stock in exchange for its
27.6% stake in TWE, which includes the Warner Bros. film studio, most
of Time Warner Cable, as well as the three cable TV networks. AT&amp;T
also would get a stake of more than 20% in a new cable TV business
that would have about 9 million subscribers, which AOL Time Warner
would sell to the public, depending on market conditions, people
familiar with the deal said. The 20% stake would be valued at about
$5.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The deal will help AT&amp;T cut its debt load and strengthen its
balance sheet as it prepares to sell its cable TV business, AT&amp;T
Broadband, to Comcast.</TE>
<TE>   JP Morgan's Bazinet estimated that the sale of AT&amp;T's stake in TWE
would generate about $5.8 billion to $6.5 billion in after-tax
proceeds and help the combined AT&amp;T-Comcast maintain investment-grade
debt ratings.</TE>
<TE>   To fund the TWE purchase, Bazinet said, AOL would issue about 136
million shares of common stock and use about $2 billion from its
existing credit facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AOL rose 77 cents to $13.33 in NYSE trading. AT&amp;T shares
closed at $10.76, up 31 cents, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Execs in Talks on Deals for Universal</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Options could involve a buyout of movie, TV
and theme park properties or the creation of a new firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's top executives have begun exploratory talks with
several companies interested in Vivendi's American entertainment
assets, according to sources familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The prospective deals could involve either a buyout of Vivendi's
movie, television and theme park properties or the creation of a new
entertainment company to be run by Barry Diller, the current chairman
of Vivendi Universal Entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Among those who have expressed interest are cable industry magnate
John Malone, who already owns 3.5% of Vivendi. DreamWorks SKG, the
8-year-old entertainment company financed by Microsoft co-founder
Paul Allen and owned and run by filmmaker Steven Spielberg, veteran
studio executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and music industry icon David
Geffen, also talked with Diller.</LD>
<TE>   While other sources at Universal Studios dismissed the idea of a
DreamWorks-Universal deal, the studios have a long-standing
relationship, with Universal distributing the smaller company's films
and housing some of its executives in offices on its lot. Before
DreamWorks' formation, Spielberg produced some of his biggest box
office hits, including "Jaws," "E.T." and "Jurassic Park," for
Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Malone nor DreamWorks executives returned calls.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of Universal Studios, estimated to worth at least $20
billion, would go a long way toward solving Vivendi's crippling debt
problem. That is, if buyers are willing to pay something close to
what the assets are worth.</TE>
<TE>   With shares of leading media companies AOL Time Warner Inc. and
Walt Disney Co. selling at record lows and Wall Street struggling
under the cloud of corporate malfeasance, it couldn't be a worse time
to try to sell anything.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal's shares rocketed more than 20% on Monday as
investors reacted to word that the conglomerate could secure $2
billion in financing and had entered talks to sell its stake in a
money-losing Internet venture.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the prospect of the loan package and the possible
sale of the half-stake in the Vizzavi wireless Internet portal helped
rally the shares, which plunged 45% last week after Chief Executive
Jean-Rene Fourtou warned of a liquidity crunch. Selling its stake in
Vizzavi, however, would do almost nothing to alleviate Vivendi's
$19-billion media-related debt burden--the stake is considered
worthless. But it would mark another symbolic nail in the coffin of
former CEO Jean-Marie Messier, who was ousted over the costly bid to
become a media titan.</TE>
<TE>   Messier had touted Vizzavi as a distribution system that would
play a pivotal role in Vivendi's move to build synergy. He said the
Internet portal would be a means of selling Universal's music and
films to mobile-phone customers. But more than two years after
launching, the service remains riddled with technical problems and
offers little content.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi executives confirmed they are in talks to sell their stake
to Vodafone Group, Vivendi's partner in the 50-50 joint venture.
Vodafone probably would absorb Vizzavi equipment and services and
eliminate the Vizzavi brand. Vivendi's bid to jettison the stake
follows a failed revival of the Internet portal. In January,
Vizzavi's owners undertook a management shake-up and laid off about
100 employees. But the restructuring failed to staunch the losses.</TE>
<TE>   The move also comes as Fourtou is accelerating an auction of
Vivendi's assets. He has put U.S. publisher Houghton Mifflin on the
block, as well as a stake in satellite-television provider EchoStar
Communications Corp. and part of French pay-television firm Canal
Plus. Fourtou has declared he plans to raise $9.8 billion from asset
sales during the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   According to Vivendi sources, the company also plans to sell the
rest of its European publishing units. However, Fourtou told the
company via e-mail this week that he would do no such thing.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's exit from its touted wireless distribution venture,
executives say, also underscores the message Fourtou has conveyed to
them.</TE>
<TE>   Although early asset-sale plans have not included entertainment
assets, Fourtou has made it clear that Vivendi has little intention
of remaining a major player in the entertainment business.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, an open letter sent by Fourtou to employees and

<HD>Reviving the Village</HD>
<DH>Despite Westwood's affluent demographics, competing
interests have hampered efforts to renew the area</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The long-standing effort to revive Westwood Village has produced
uneven results despite its prime location and hundreds of millions of
dollars in private and public investment.</LD>
<LD>   The arrival of new restaurants and a much-needed supermarket are
offset by the absence of high-profile retailers and stalled
development projects. Merchants grumble about the lack of affordable
and convenient public parking, while complaints about Westwood's
business improvement district have put the organization's renewal
process on hold. Developers and homeowner groups, meanwhile, continue
to wrangle over proposed projects.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a challenge because there are so many players with so many
disparate interests," said Los Angeles City Council member Jack
Weiss, who represents the area. "It's very hard to get people on the
same page to agree to the same vision."</LD>
<TE>   The lack of a cohesive vision has undermined the strengths of
Westwood Village, which is surrounded by UCLA, some of the city's
most affluent neighborhoods and the high-rent office towers of
Wilshire Boulevard, retail and urban planning experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The demographics around Westwood are phenomenal and UCLA is a
great benefit," said retail consultant Rob York. But, he said, "I
don't think there is any clear vision of what Westwood Village is or
wants to be."</TE>
<TE>   Westwood Village has come a long way since it bottomed out in the
early 1990s, when the recession and the emergence of new malls and
other pedestrian-oriented hot spots siphoned away retailers and
shoppers. Bursts of youth violence also tarnished the area's image
and kept older and more affluent customers away.</TE>
<TE>   In the latter half of the decade, public and private money began
to pour into Westwood. The city funded construction of a parking
garage as well as street and sidewalk improvements along Broxton
Avenue. The Westwood Village Business Improvement District was formed
to help maintain cleanliness and attract businesses and shoppers to
the area.</TE>
<TE>   Experienced and well-funded developers such as Ira Smedra, Regent
Properties and Madison Marquette unveiled ambitious plans to build
theaters and stores. About 100 businesses, including several high-end
restaurants, a boutique hotel and Westwood Village's first
supermarket in 25 years, have opened in recent years, cutting the
retail vacancy rate to about 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Though far smaller in size and scope than when it was first
announced five years ago, the Regent Properties' Westwood
Marketplace--which includes a Whole Foods market--is finally taking
shape on the west end of the village on a block between Broxton and
Gayley avenues.</TE>
<TE>   "Westwood has great demographics, great architecture and great
demand," said Doug Brown, managing partner of Regent Properties.
"People want to be in Westwood."</TE>
<TE>   Despite these signs of progress, the pace of change has been far
slower and more spotty than many observers had expected. The retail
scene remains uneven, with some new stores reporting healthy sales
while others have struggled or failed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going in the right direction," said Bob Walsh, executive
director of the Westwood Village Business Improvement District. "Does
that mean we are done? No, we have huge challenges before us."</TE>
<TE>   On Westwood's eastern flank, Smedra abandoned his proposed
$100-million project on Glendon Avenue after facing stiff opposition
from residents and other village groups. The five-acre site remains
mostly empty as a second developer, Casden Properties, seeks to build
a mixed-use project featuring 350 apartments and ground-floor shops.
The fate of that project remains to be decided as the developer,
residents and public officials debate whether it exceeds
city-mandated limits on density and height.</TE>
<TE>   In the heart of the Village, Madison Marquette, a national retail
development specialist, opened a Ralphs supermarket in the former
Bullock's department store space and leased the many storefronts it
controls along Westwood Boulevard, the Village's main drag. But the
company concedes that the Village still needs a more dynamic retail
scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd still like to see more of a critical mass of retail--things
that will create a reason to hang out in the Village," said Robert A.
Baker, leasing director for Madison Marquette.</TE>
<TE>   While the Village's retail vacancy rate has declined, Madison
Marquette and other Westwood landlords have been criticized for
failing to attract more high-end, fashion-oriented chains. Steve
Sann, a Westwood neighborhood activist, was taken aback when Madison
Marquette signed Office Depot to occupy space on Westwood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't find Office Depot on the Third Street Promenade or
Montana Avenue," Sann said. "Office Depot is great, but it's a
question of good urban planning. These landlords are making these
very shortsighted deals."</TE>
<TE>   The owners of Tengu, a 3-year-old Asian fusion restaurant, say the
addition of more high-end retailers as well as improved parking and
districtwide promotion would help boost business during lunch and on
weekend evenings.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't hang out here," said general manager Guy Ravid.
"They are not coming out here for the weekend to go shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very optimistic," he added. "I still love the Village. It's
such a beautiful, quaint neighborhood. I'm still hoping it will kick
in, but with some more retail and parking."</TE>

<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission accepted accounting
certifications from top executives at AOL Time Warner Inc.,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Reliant Energy Inc. on Monday, while
listing one from Mirant Corp. as not in compliance.</LD>
<LD>   Mirant, a big North American natural-gas trader whose accounting
is under review by the SEC, joined 12 other companies whose
certifications were listed earlier as not in compliance. AOL Time
Warner and Bristol-Myers were reported as acceptable by the SEC even
though they have said their financial results may need to be
restated. Reliant's trading arm, Reliant Resources Inc., is under SEC
investigation for sham trades and other transactions.</LD>
<LD>   The agency had posted certifications from about 769 companies on
its Web site as of Monday night, with several companies still under
examination. Most were reviewed last week.</LD>

<HD>Road Warfare Takes a Toll on Survivors</HD>
<DH>Researchers have found post-traumatic stress disorder, long
associated with battle, in people who live through highway crashes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Post-traumatic stress disorder has long been recognized as a syndrome
afflicting battle-scarred soldiers, sexual assault victims and
survivors of catastrophic natural disasters. But it has been only in
the last decade that it has been linked to an occurrence so common as
to be considered routine: motor vehicle accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers, in fact, now believe that by virtue of their very
frequency, serious car crashes are the leading--and most
overlooked--cause of the disorder in the general population.</LD>
<LD>   Recent studies have put the number of people at risk of developing
post-traumatic stress after an accident in the hundreds of thousands,
or 25% of the 3 million Americans injured in collisions each year.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a bit of a notion when the disorder was introduced to
the professional world that it had to be something outside of the
range of normal experience to count as a stressor," said Edward B.
Blanchard, coauthor of the book "After the Crash: Assessment and
Treatment of Motor Vehicle Accident Survivors." "People have come to
realize that, when there is a noticeable threat to life or limb, and
you are frightened by it, that is enough to lead to PTSD."</TE>
<TE>   Post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychiatric condition whose
symptoms include re-experiencing a life-threatening event through
mental flashbacks; intrusive thoughts or nightmares; a psychic
"numbing" that presents itself as diminished interest in people and
activities, as well as in efforts to avoid situations that arouse
memories of the trauma; and increased irritability, fearfulness and
difficulty concentrating.</TE>
<TE>   While it is normal for someone who has been in an accident to
exhibit one or more signs of the disorder, people who fully develop
the condition continue to be tormented by anxiety long after their
physical injuries have healed. To be diagnosed with the disorder, a
patient must usually have symptoms that persist for three months or
more.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say the immediacy of the situation is dissipated. You got
your new car. You got the attorney. And yet you notice you don't feel
any better than at the time of the accident. In fact you may feel
worse," said C. Scott Saunders, co-director of the UCLA Trauma
Psychiatry Service, which evaluates and treats patients suffering
from the disorder. "Whenever you are caused to remember the accident,
it will be fresh and vivid, like it was yesterday. That is your first
clue."</TE>
<TE>   The mental anguish that sufferers experience can strain personal
relationships and cause difficulties on the job. Another frequent
by-product is difficulty getting back behind the wheel of a car, or
even riding as a passenger.</TE>
<TE>   According to Saunders, it is very common for his patients to drive
slowly in the left-hand lane of the freeway to minimize their
exposure to other vehicles, to freeze when they hear fire engines or
ambulances or to go miles out of their way to avoid road conditions
similar to the ones they encountered during their accident.</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol statistics show the stunning frequency
of serious car accidents. During 2000, the last year for which data
are available, 303,023 Californians--one in every 114 residents--were
injured in collisions. (In Los Angeles County, the figure was one in
every 109 people.)</TE>
<TE>   That means that, if the one-quarter measure that Blanchard and
other researchers use to predict the prevalence of post-traumatic
stress disorder is accurate, 75,755 new crash-related cases would
have developed statewide that year.</TE>
<TE>   According to UCLA's Saunders, who began his career by treating
Vietnam War veterans, car accident survivors constitute the single
largest category of post-traumatic stress patients he has treated.
Interestingly, though, half of them weren't even seriously injured in
their crashes.</TE>
<TE>   "The odd thing about a motor vehicle accident is, it isn't what
happened, per se," Saunders said. "What matters is that, in the
course of those events, you believed there was no way you were going
to survive. You needed to have the moment of feeling helpless as you
met what seemed obvious to you as the face of death. You can be in a
horrific accident and if you were taking evasive measures, had a good
idea of what was happening and never reached that point of
hopelessness, you won't develop PTSD."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, his patients who walked away with only bumps and bruises
are often the ones who suffer the most because their psychological
pain seems out of proportion to the event.</TE>
<TE>   "A person who is devastated by PTSD can begin to wonder if he is
losing his mind because he tells himself, 'It can't be that little
auto accident that caused me to change the course of my life
forever,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   While clinicians used to think that children's emotional
immaturity afforded them immunity from the psychological trauma of a
traffic accident, recent research has shown that they are just as
vulnerable as adults, perhaps even more so.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Pynoos, a nationally recognized child psychiatrist who
directs the UCLA trauma center along with Saunders, said it is easy
for adults to overlook the traumas that children experience "as if
they didn't appraise the threat for what it was."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he thinks that, since children do not know how
to drive, their sense of helplessness may actually be greater.</TE>
<TE>   Although many psychiatrists believe that the disorder often goes
undiagnosed in children and adults, some clinicians believe the
number of people at risk of developing it has been overestimated in
recent studies. Mark Levy, a forensic psychiatrist who teaches at UC
San Francisco, said the promise of multimillion-dollar pain and
suffering awards has prompted personal injury lawyers to seek
post-traumatic stress diagnoses for their clients.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fairly new idea that PTSD is in the 25% incidence range,
so for auto accidents I would think it is an inflated figure driven
by compensation and the plaintiff's bar," Levy said. "The fact that
someone was shook up or even had some symptoms doesn't mean they have
PTSD."</TE>
<TE>   According to Blanchard, many, or even most of the patients with
post-traumatic stress resulting from traffic accidents, will get over
it on their own, usually within six months. For the rest, intensive
psychological therapy may be required.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment methods include encouraging patients to confront their
fears in a safe environment, helping them counteract their
catastrophic thoughts with healthier ones and teaching them
relaxation techniques.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of people who have been scared off from driving, that
might also mean easing them step-by-step into the driver's seat,
starting with simply sitting in a car and working their way toward
putting the key into the ignition and driving around the block.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting back behind the wheel is a very hard thing, but it is a
good thing," Blanchard said.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Time Yet for Slavery Reparations</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Reparations for slavery, once a fringe issue touted by a motley mix
of black separatists, zealots and crackpots and that respected
mainstream civil rights leaders shunned, have now been slammed onto
the nation's public-policy plate.</LD>
<LD>   NAACP, Urban League and Congressional Black Caucus leaders all
agree that reparations have merit. Outside of President Bush's
national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, no other prominent black
dares to publicly denounce reparations. Even some top white
politicians, such as Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, have given a
passing nod to reparations as valid for consideration. The
Washington, D.C., reparations march Saturday aimed to put pressure on
Congress and the administration to soften their resistance to
reparations.</LD>
<LD>   However, there is a simple reason Bush will not embrace
reparations. He reads the opinion polls, and they show that the
overwhelming majority of whites, other nonblacks and even many blacks
think that reparations are a bad idea. And the numbers aren't close.
A CNN/USA Today poll taken after blacks filed two well-publicized
reparations lawsuits last February found that 75% of Americans said
corporations should not pay reparations, and a whopping 90% said the
government should not pay reparations.</LD>
<TE>   Reparations advocates have grabbed at every argument in the book
to dent the wall of public resistance. They offer assurances that
black millionaires, corporate presidents, superstar athletes and
entertainers won't get a dime of reparations money, that it will go
to programs to aid the black poor and that it won't guilt-trip all
whites. They point out that Japanese Americans and Holocaust
survivors have gotten reparations.</TE>
<TE>   These arguments still fall on deaf ears. The reparations movement
can't shake the public tag that it is a movement exclusively of, by
and for blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite countless speeches pleading for racial brotherhood and
interracial cooperation by Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil
rights leaders, that same tag was imprinted on the civil rights
movement in the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   It took national shock and revulsion over Southern mobs beating,
maiming and killing white civil rights workers, and the massive
presence of thousands of white students in Southern backwater towns,
to shake the "for blacks only" label from the civil rights movement.
Only then did it gain widespread public and political acceptance as
an authentic movement to change laws and as public policy that would
benefit labor, women, minorities and even whites as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   The reparations movement does not possess the inherent racial
egalitarianism of the civil rights movement. It is ensnared by its
racial isolationism. The focus is solely to compensate the
descendants of black slaves and whipsaw whites for modern-day racism.
Most whites almost certainly applaud the fight to improve failing
inner-city public schools, to provide better housing and health care
and to battle drugs and the scourge of HIV/AIDS among blacks. But
they also believe that these are social ills that afflict other
minorities, the poor and marginally employed working-class whites
nearly as hard. Reparations advocates make no mention of this.</TE>
<TE>   As a consequence, reparations come off as a scam that would
squander hard-earned tax dollars with nothing in return. In a time of
soaring budget deficits, corporate meltdowns, the stock slide and the
looming peril of massive layoffs that batter middle-class workers,
reparations seem like a frivolous issue that is politically divisive
and racially polarizing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the colossal resistance to reparations, a compelling
argument still can be made that it is in the interest of government
and business to pump more funds into specific projects, such as
AIDS/HIV education and prevention, remedial education, job skills and
training, drug and alcohol counseling and rehabilitation, computer
access and literacy training. Such projects would boost the black
poor, not gut public revenues and, most important, not finger all
whites as culpable for slavery.</TE>
<TE>   The issue won't go away, but as long as most Americans are
convinced that reparations are a terrible idea, a march won't do much
to change their thinking.</TE>

<HD>Simplistic Hunt for Evil in a Complex World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doomed by the incoherence of a foreign policy defined largely by
biblical notions of the struggle between good and evil, the Bush
administration thrashes about in its hunt for the devil. Sadly, all
that has produced are shopworn enemies that were once our surrogates
in battles we would rather forget.</LD>
<LD>   That is the case with Saddam Hussein, whose war against Iran in
the 1980s was decisively aided by a U.S. eager to protect pro-Western
Arab oil sheikdoms from the contamination of Iran's virulently
anti-American Islamic revolution. Hussein's use of chemical weapons,
now cited with horror in the Bush administration's daily demonization
of Hussein, occurred early in that war and was well known to U.S.
officials, who at least implicitly condoned his war crimes.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent evidence of this complicity was reported Sunday in
the New York Times: "A covert American program during the Reagan
administration provided Iraq with critical battle planning assistance
at a time when American intelligence agencies knew that Iraqi
commanders would employ chemical weapons."</LD>
<TE>   Iran, which also used chemical weapons, still is ruled by the same
type of religious zealots who once seized the U.S. Embassy and kept
Americans captive. But while President Bush early this year placed it
in his "axis of evil," along with North Korea and Iraq, Iran is now
viewed more ambiguously because Hamid Karzai, the president of
Afghanistan, is dependent on Tehran for his life.</TE>
<TE>   The Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance--our ally in fighting the
Taliban and which now controls the Afghan military--was long backed
by Iran. A brutal bunch, it stands accused by the United Nations of
having suffocated hundreds, if not thousands, of Taliban prisoners
whom the U.S. entrusted to Northern Alliance care.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, the token representative of the country's Pashtun majority
and hand-selected by the U.S., is no match for the Northern Alliance
thugs and will be gone the day their Iranian sponsors give the word.
Thus the warm greeting extended by Karzai to Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami on his visit to Kabul last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan nightmare, as the Russians learned, never ends. Our
current allies will be tomorrow's enemies, as it has always been.
Recall that the Taliban's members and its Arab supporters in Al Qaeda
are veterans of the moujahedeen, who  were once hailed by the Reagan
administration as anti-Soviet "freedom fighters.'' And that the
Taliban government was congratulated by U.S. officials only weeks
before Sept. 11 for having dramatically eliminated Afghanistan's huge
opium harvest and was rewarded with increased U.S. economic aid
through the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   In the area controlled by the Northern Alliance, however, the
opium trade was still king. And, not surprisingly, with the Taliban
gone, Afghanistan is again the major supplier to the world heroin
market.</TE>
<TE>   Conveniently, the drug war that obsessed this administration
before Sept. 11 is now ignored. Our new enemy is not dope growers but
Iraq, even though Bush has produced no convincing evidence that
Baghdad has anything to do with the Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   The country that clearly does, of course, is that hotbed of
hypocrisy, Saudi Arabia, homeland of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the
Sept. 11 hijackers. The sheikdom is now being sued for $1 trillion by
families of the Sept. 11 victims. But President Bush would never move
against the Saudis because American corporations, some led by close
Bush family friends and associates, do too much business there.</TE>
<TE>   So who else can Bush invade to take our minds off the dismal
economy that his much-ballyhooed tax cut failed to save and may have
helped wreck? Not North Korea, the third member of Bush's evil axis,
which is proving a major disappointment by giving strong signals of
embracing Chinese-style capitalism while courting its rich neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   How depressing for Bush administration militarists that the world
is such a complex place. For a few months, it seemed that the
invasion of Iraq was the ticket to ride into another four-year term,
but then the most respected of GOP elders, Brent Scowcroft and Henry
Kissinger, rose up to remind Junior that just such hubris had
destroyed his father's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Time to forgo the biblical allegories of good and evil and
recognize that in the 21st century, smiting one's enemies is an
elusive goal requiring patience and subtlety, as well as timely
heroics. The enemy, whether it be global warming, addictive drugs,
endemic poverty, religious fanaticism, terrorism or weapons of mass
destruction, is best thought of as a dangerous disease succored by
ignorance, pride and avarice--sins of which the U.S. too is sometimes
guilty. That is why we will continue to be tormented by monsters of
our own creation.</TE>

<HD>Bluff and Bluster Never Are Effective With North Korea</HD>
<DH>Diplomatic give and take would get a better response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEON V. SIGAL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is no surprise that North Korea is reviving efforts to reconcile
with South Korea and will soon reopen long-stalled normalization
talks with Japan. North Korea has even been waiting since April to
resume arms talks with the United States. Yet North Korea is now
warning that it may break the October 1994 "agreed framework" with
the U.S. that froze its nuclear arms program. What is the North up
to?</LD>
<LD>   North Korea's talks with South Korea, Japan and the U.S. are a
continuation of a decade-old effort by North Korea to end enmity with
its Cold War rivals. In the late 1980s, the North's longtime ruler,
the late Kim Il Sung, decided to give up his country's nuclear arms
program in return for ending adversarial relations with the United
States. At the same time, Pyongyang has threatened to resume nuclear
bomb-making as a way of pressuring Washington to live up to its end
of the bargain--delivering a replacement reactor by 2003, easing
economic sanctions and taking other steps to end enmity.</LD>
<LD>   When Washington was slow to do so from 1995 to 1998, Pyongyang
threatened to break the accord. It has now also demanded electricity
to compensate for the delay in constructing the reactor.</LD>
<TE>   Pyongyang has now been applying the same tactics with its
missiles. Starting in 1998, it expressed readiness to freeze its
missile program. It may eventually be willing to give up that program
and ease its artillery threat to Seoul as well, but North Korea's
tough bargaining has led many foreign policy observers to accuse
Pyongyang of engaging in blackmail to coerce economic aid without
giving up anything significant in return. It is not. It is simply
playing a diplomatic game of tit for tat, cooperating whenever the
U.S. cooperates and retaliating when Washington reneges.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the U.S. did improve relations with North Korea,
and in October 2000 the two countries issued a joint communique
declaring that "neither government would have hostile intent toward
the other." North Korea's latest threat to renege on the October 1994
agreed framework is its response to a Bush administration campaign to
repudiate the "no hostile intent" pledge and unilaterally rewrite the
agreed framework.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration signaled this most clearly at a ceremony
Aug. 7 in North Korea to mark the belated pouring of concrete for the
first light-water nuclear reactor to be built under the accord. It
was here that administration officials renewed their insistence that
Pyongyang cooperate immediately with inspectors of the the United
Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, who want to
determine how much plutonium North Korea has produced.</TE>
<TE>   However desirable knowing that may be, the North is not obliged to
do so until 2005, when construction of the long-delayed reactor nears
completion, according to Robert Gallucci, chief U.S. negotiator with
North Korea during the Clinton administration. The Bush
administration's "unilateral reinterpretation of the agreed framework
... is not supported by the framework's language or any reading of
its negotiating history," Gallucci told the Arms Control Assn. last
April. He added that the accord provides that when a significant
portion of the light-water nuclear reactor is completed, but before
delivery of key nuclear components, North Korea "will come into full
compliance with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA."</TE>
<TE>   It seems as if the unilateralists on the right wing of the Bush
administration are eager to trash the agreed framework, no matter
what. That would be foolish because last year Pyongyang hinted that
it was willing to make a deal to trade electricity for inspections.
Its latest statement on this subject, on Aug. 13, makes that offer
more explicit and adds that the North "will move if the U.S. does."
It also reiterates its tit-for-tat threat to break the accord if
Washington proves unwilling to deal.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomatic give and take also offers the best way to address the
administration's other nuclear concerns. Undersecretary of State John
Bolton has accused North Korea, along with Iraq, of having "covert
nuclear weapons programs, in violation of the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty." On June 1, referring to North Korea as
well as Iraq, President Bush threatened to "confront the worst
threats before they emerge."</TE>
<TE>   But even if other nuclear sites do exist in North Korea, how can
they be attacked without knowing their precise location? Saber
rattling also puts the U.S. squarely in the way of North-South
reconciliation and antagonizes Japan and China as well.</TE>
<TE>   Bluffing has never worked before with Pyongyang, and it won't work
now. Sooner or later, every president since Ronald Reagan has given
diplomatic give and take a try, to good effect. President Bush needs
to take a lesson from his predecessors and do the same.</TE>

<LD>The innocent pleasures of summer are gone forever. When I was a boy,
I played in the sun from morning until dusk, my skin burning
dutifully on Memorial Day and turning a dark brown by Labor Day. Now,
the same sun is an unstable nuclear reactor melting down the soft,
pale DNA of my four defenseless kids. After an hour on the beach, I
rush my kids into a dark, air-conditioned room like rare mushrooms
that are not yet mature.</LD>
<LD>   The traditional summer foods of my childhood--hamburgers and hot
dogs, cole slaw and potato salad--today are biohazards. The July 4th
picnic struck me as a terrifying game of Russian roulette, so my kids
eat veggie burgers and soy dogs on whole wheat buns. We track E. coli
and salmonella outbreaks the way other families follow the Yankees or
the Dow Jones.</LD>
<LD>   In the summer I lived on Hi-C and bug juice, Pixie Stix and
Sno-Cones, but my kids are rationed to one glass of orange juice and
two sugar-free cookies a day.</LD>
<TE>   When I was a kid, I rode off on my bike and returned home 12 hours
later, knees bloody, clothes torn, hair thick with burrs and thorns.
My kids can't ride their bikes past the lip of the driveway, which I
blockade with orange traffic cones. They can't even walk down the
block to see their friends--not with Fox News blaring live kidnapping
updates 24 hours a day. I walked to Little League games alone, a
phenomenon my kids will never experience, like drive-ins and disco.</TE>
<TE>   My brother and I wandered off down a local creek bed in search of
frogs. My kids can explore the attic. There are no frogs left out
there anyway, just walking carnivorous fish.</TE>
<TE>   My brother and I went on impromptu bowling trips, to concerts and
on hayrides. Now, any activity that requires adult supervision means
investigative services and itchy parental coalitions. The new music
teacher is taking the kids to Hollywood Bowl? That's nice. Please
provide a cheek swab and urine sample.</TE>
<TE>   We watched TV late at night, unsupervised; my mom knew every show
on the dial. Now, we micro-monitor the kids to shield them from
deviant sex specials on HBO, pay-per-view blood spectacles and
Eminem. Meanwhile, on good old PBS, Muppets are dying of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The price of parenthood is eternal vigilance. I'm exhausted; I
need a vacation but I'm afraid to fly.</TE>

<HD>An Ax Over Homeowners</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For sale: charming house  near the Sonoma County coast. Market value:
$300,000. Asking price: $2,403. That's not a typo. It's the
steal-of-a-deal that a real estate partnership snagged at a
foreclosure auction. The owner had fallen $567 behind in homeowner
association dues, used to maintain the development's swimming pools
and other amenities. He got his title back, but only after a yearlong
court fight.</LD>
<LD>   Many Californians lose their homes after missing a single payment
of the dues used to keep up common areas. This legal rip-off allows
homeowners associations to add collection fees and lawyers' costs to
the missed payment, quickly ballooning the amount owed.</LD>
<LD>   Condos, townhouses, mobile homes and houses in subdivisions that
share grounds or amenities too quickly go to auction. Bidding starts
low, at an amount equal to the delinquent dues, other fees and
foreclosure costs. At some sales, the winner is a single bidder who
obviously knows something that desperate house-hunters do not.</LD>
<TE>   California law should protect property owners by giving them 30
days to catch up before homeowners associations impose
debt-collection and attorney fees and threaten to impose liens. The
owners also should get a fair chance to discuss payment plans with
association boards before liens are recorded and their homes are
sold.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature can help by approving a bill, AB 2289, that would
require adequate notice and a reasonable period before a homeowners
association pounced. The measure, by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe
(D-San Diego), on behalf of the California Congress of Seniors, has
already passed the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   This bill does not excuse missed payments or forgive back dues. It
would stop boards and their predatory hired guns from rapidly taking
advantage of owners who were slightly behind on their association
dues.</TE>
<TE>   In May, a student missed a $31 payment for the upkeep of a little
green space in her townhouse complex near Sacramento. On May 16, she
was delinquent. She included the amount and a $10 late fee with her
June payment. Because part of that payment was delinquent, the
homeowners association returned her uncashed check and sicced its
lawyer on her. By June 24, she faced a bill nearly 10 times the
original amount. She didn't pay that $307. She did send in her July
payment on time. Back went that $31 check. The lawyer's meter kept
running until she paid $598.72 early last month to satisfy the
original dues and avoid a lien and foreclosure. She kept her home.</TE>
<TE>   A missed payment shouldn't double, triple or quadruple in a couple
of weeks. Thirty days would be fair to property owners as long as
they received proper and timely notification. AB 2289 would require
those consumer protections. The state Senate is scheduled to vote
this week. The bill should become law.</TE>

<LD>Violence tends to spike in hot weather, and Los Angeles during the
last month suffered the gangland equivalent of global warming:
triple-digit highs and 50 homicides. As of Monday, the body count for
the year was 407, up 22% from this time last year. The killings don't
stop at the city border. Homicides in unincorporated areas and cities
patrolled by the county Sheriff's Department stand at 217. The
victims include 2-month-old Teiana English, who died on a hot night
in Compton after thugs fired into her father's car.</LD>
<LD>   Although L.A. city homicides are well below the record 1,092 set
in 1992, the proportion attributed to gangs has doubled since then,
to almost 60%. Crime researchers blame the rising violence on the
stalled economy, the wave of inmates jailed in the 1990s who have
served their time and are returning to the streets and a population
bulge of crime-prone adolescents.</LD>
<TE>   They also point to neglect. The history of anti-gang programs is a
story of high-profile starts that peter out unnoticed. Take the
response in 1988 when rival Crips gangs brought their feud to upscale
Westwood Village and killed Karen Toshima, a 27-year-old graphic
artist caught in crossfire. Or in 1995 when gang members shot
3-year-old Stephanie Kuhen after her family made a wrong turn in
Cypress Park. Both killings sparked public outrage but not sustained
action. Attention waned when the mayhem stayed within poor
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   It's not too late to learn from our lapses. Two years ago, the
state Legislature passed the Schiff-Cardenas Crime Prevention Act,
which allocated money for anti-gang policing and an equal amount for
mentoring, job training and other preventive programs. But today what
was supposed to be an annual source of funding languishes in the
budget impasse between the Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In May, L.A. Mayor James K. Hahn announced an anti-gang plan that
redeployed cops from desk work to street patrol and matched at-risk
kids with summer jobs. Hahn also has improved lighting and installed
police drop-in centers at besieged city parks. Now the mayor needs to
appoint someone to lead the city's anti-gang efforts and link them to
federal, state, county and private programs.</TE>
<TE>   Gang violence is a complex, deeply rooted problem with no quick
fix. But research and experience show that a broad approach,
combining law enforcement and social services and coordinating
federal, state and local programs, is effective--as long as cops,
social workers, community leaders and politicians keep at it, day
after day, year after year.</TE>
<TE>   The cost for not doing so adds up to more than the numbers killed.
Ask Meichelle Isrel, who stepped out of a car in front of her
grandmother's house in Compton, heard shots and turned to see her
baby, Teiana, covered with blood. She became one of 624 city and
county homicide victims so far this year. But how do you measure the
heartache she leaves behind?</TE>

<LD>Israel's agreement Sunday to withdraw troops from the West Bank city
of Bethlehem and parts of the Gaza Strip in exchange for a
Palestinian crackdown on militants has produced a limited, shaky
cease-fire. It could, however, open the way to a broader halt in the
two years of violence that has killed nearly 600 Israelis in mostly
suicide bombings and 1,500 Palestinians in targeted assassinations
and army assaults.</LD>
<LD>   The most obvious stumbling block is the refusal of radical
Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad to stop their
terror attacks no matter what the Palestinian Authority agrees to.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's security forces must make serious,
visible efforts to stop terrorists from killing Israelis. Israel must
fulfill its promise to end the hardships imposed by nearly
around-the-clock curfews that have devastated the Palestinians'
economy and their quality of life.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement between Israel's defense minister, Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, and the Palestinian Authority's interior minister, Abdel
Razak Yehiyeh, was the first notable accord between the two sides in
months and the first negotiated without mediation by the United
States or other referees.</LD>
<TE>   The first Israeli pullbacks Monday coincided with reports that Abu
Nidal, a breakaway Palestinian terrorist whose Revolutionary Council
of Fatah has killed hundreds of people, was found dead of gunshot
wounds in Iraq. Abu Nidal's victims included both Israelis and aides
to Arafat, a reminder that Palestinians do not constitute a
monolithic group. Last week, for instance, an Arafat aide criticized
Hamas for blocking a unified Palestinian front against suicide
attacks and for rejecting coexistence with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   If Palestinian security forces can reduce the violence, Israeli
troops are expected to withdraw from other occupied West Bank
territories. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Gulf states allied with
the Palestinians should help train security forces to collect
intelligence and arrest terrorists before they attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which has strongly backed Israel and has
also proclaimed its support for an eventual Palestinian state, has a
role as well. CIA Director George J. Tenet outlined plans for a
cease-fire more than a year ago, but it never took hold. Tenet met
with Palestinian officials in Washington this month. He and other
U.S. experts can help keep negotiations going, but it's up to Israel
and the Palestinians to do the early work, to provide a first,
tenuous thread of trust.</TE>

<HD>Ignoring an Economy in Need of Repair</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many readers may construe Arianna Huffington's viewpoint as just so
much carping without a positive alternative (Commentary, Aug. 16). As
easy as it is to knock the president when the economy is this bad
off, no one has at his or her disposal the huge resources of George
W. Bush to initiate constructive repair to this country's economy
right now. Even one historical reference--Roosevelt's public works
programs--shows what true leadership can provide.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Huffington admirably paints a dismal picture of what has
happened to the presidency when a second-rate, out-of-touch and
unresponsive figurehead who was put in office by a Supreme Court paid
for by Republican funds tries to make it look like he's "working."</LD>
<LD>   David Goldenberg</LD>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Huffington's commentary is an insult to people of any religion and
to Texans, especially the citizens of Waco. Equating the Branch
Davidian tragedy with the meeting that President Bush held in Waco is
exaggeration in the extreme. There is room in this country for "the
traditional venue of old-time religion--Baylor University" just as
there is room for less traditional Christians, Muslims, Jews and
people of all faiths. When someone uses terms and phrases such as
"Branch Bushians," "the hallelujah chorus that was determined to
drown out facts with blind faith" and "the Burning Bush preached,"
the credibility of that person is certainly called into question.</TE>
<TE>   And central Texas is really not known as a "flat, featureless"
plain to Texans. Huffington would learn a great deal about the great
strength and fortitude of the western ranchers in the state that she
mocks by reading Elmer Kelton's "The Time It Never Rained." (I am
speaking from my own experience growing up in flat west Texas, a land
that I love.)</TE>

<LD>John Balzar hit home again, this time in "Ah, Sweet Nature ... but
Only If You Can Afford a Piece of It" (Commentary, Aug 18). The Bush
administration's arrogant, environment-trashing policy keeps me
sputtering. When it gets through, what will be left of our public
lands and water? Where will ordinary Americans--the majority of whom
care about the environment--find natural places of solitude and
renewal?</LD>
<LD>   At least I see a glimmer of light from the efforts of Rep. Hilda
Solis (D-El Monte), working so that every California urban dweller
has only an hour's drive to wilderness opportunities. Her bill (HR
4947) is the Southern California counterpart to Sen. Barbara Boxer's
(D-Calif.) bill (SB 2535), which stands like a beacon amid the Bush
administration's environmental double talk. Boxer's measure would add
2.5 million acres to California's federally protected wilderness
system, plus 22 streams with wild and scenic river protection. I hope
other representatives have the courage to co-sponsor these bills,
protecting California's wild heritage for us commoners and those of
future non-elite generations.</LD>

<TE>   Given the cavalier attitude displayed by our appointed president
regarding ownership of property, let Bush participate in the reality
show that most of us do. What if nothing in life was handed to him on
a platter, including the presidency? Where would he be now? At least
he wouldn't be in the position to give away our public lands to oil
interests for their exploitation. We wouldn't have to experience his
disdainful attitude toward the landless poor, his mindless
malapropisms and his boorish dismissal of scholastic achievement.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The Dodgers' Team Color Is Now a Deep Shade of Red" (Aug. 18),
James Bates relates the $41-million deficit this year to "$13 every
time a fan walks through a turnstile." In fact, the Dodgers make $13
every time a fan walks in, and fans account for almost two-thirds of
the Dodgers' operating revenue. Bates should be focusing on the real
reasons for the deficit: $5,000 for every pitch that Kevin Brown
doesn't throw, $3,000 for every pitch that Darren Dreifort doesn't
throw or $11,000 for every at-bat where Eric Karros grounds into a
double play or just strikes out.</LD>
<LD>   Now, this fan's had it with the spoiled-brat players and their
indulgent, pouting owners. I pay about $1,000 each year just for
tickets, and I've paid my last $1,000. The other night I attended an
Angels game and boy, what a thrill it was. The players, none of whom
makes the big bucks that the Dodgers' players undeservedly get paid,
are still excited about the game.</LD>

<TE>   I cannot say how deeply moved I was by President Bush's prolific
response that a baseball strike would be "bad" ("Bush May Whiff if He
Mediates Dispute," Aug. 17). If only the players and owners could
articulate it as well, perhaps we wouldn't have this crisis. Yet I am
curious as to whether this "bad" is as bad as the economy he chooses
to do nothing about. Or is it as bad as our health-care system that
he chooses to ignore. Or perhaps it is as bad as our "we are tough on
Iraq, but we really can't decide what to do about it" problem. All I
know is that accomplishing nothing is bad. I would elaborate further,
but I feel that I may want to run for president someday.</TE>

bankruptcy.</TE>

to the radio. No empty words of anger from fans. This time, action.</TE>

<LD>Re "Senate Passes Gun Liability Bill," Aug. 15: Let me see if I
understand the California Senate's actions clearly. If a product
(e.g., car, household appliance, toy) malfunctions while being used
properly and responsibly by its operator, injures the operator and/or
anyone else, the victim or victims of that malfunctioning product can
seek legal recourse against the manufacturer. Now the Senate states
that even if the product (e.g., gun) does not malfunction but is used
improperly by the operator, the victims of that nonmalfunctioning

<LD>Re "Ex-D.A. Nominated for City Ethics Panel Post," Aug. 15: It was
wholly inappropriate for Los Angeles City Council President Alex
Padilla to appoint former Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti to the city of Los
Angeles' Ethics Commission, because his son Eric Garcetti is a member
of the L.A. City Council. A conflict of interest is inherent in the
position to which the elder Garcetti is appointed. It also shows
that, despite term limits, a new "old boys' network" exists. It is
naive to think that having a Garcetti on the City Council didn't help
secure the appointment.</LD>

<LD>Re "Youth Gets 50 to Life for Shootings" (Aug. 16), on Charles "Andy"
Williams' school rampage: Trigger locks are well made and difficult
to remove. Many young men think a lot about guns, and sometimes about
using them to get revenge. Chances are that the kids will know where
the gun is hidden, but with a lock inserted it would be inoperable.
If the gun owner had spent about $20 for a trigger lock this horrible
situation may not have happened, and these young lives could have
been saved. Is that too much to ask of a gun owner?</LD>

<LD>Norah Vincent's vision that the European Union's proposed anti-spam
legislation would protect consumer privacy is a forlorn hope
(Commentary, Aug. 15). It is unlikely that limiting spammers to
contacting only consumers with whom they had a preexisting business
relationship would decrease the amount of spam e-mail. Any consumer
reading a company's privacy policy will find that ubiquitous phrase
"our trusted business partners" neatly buried in the policy.
Accepting e-mail from the company with which one has a preexisting
relationship means accepting spam from its partners as well, and from
the partners' partners, ad infinitum. In short, this limitation would
be no limitation at all.</LD>
<LD>   Only empowering consumers to completely opt out from receiving all
unsolicited commercial e-mail and enacting penalties against spammers
and their abettors (e.g., Internet service providers, third-party
re-mailers, e-mail list distributors) who violate consumer privacy
will lead to a decrease in spam.</LD>
<TE>   But it should surprise no one that on the same page Mike McCurry
and Larry Purpuro proposed exempting politically oriented e-mail from
any anti-spam legislation. When California Senate Bill 771 (limiting
unsolicited telephone sales calls) was passed in 2001, the
Legislature exempted political calls from the prohibition. This was
hypocritical, but not unexpected, and McCurry and Purpuro will,
undoubtedly, get their wish. Although political speech is important,
unwanted e-mail (and unwanted telephone calls) is still an
unnecessary intrusion on privacy.</TE>

<TE>   Just as door-to-door salesmen do not enter my house without my
permission, unsolicited commercial e-mail should not be permitted to
enter my computer without my permission. We need a federal law to
require that all unsolicited commercial e-mail be coded so that
consumers can easily block this spam through ordinary Internet
security software. Political e-mail might also be coded to give the
consumer the choice of accepting or blocking political advertising.</TE>

<HD>E. Bredsdorff, 90; Hans C. Andersen Biographer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elias Bredsdorff, a biographer who sought to take Hans Christian
Andersen out of the nursery and present him as a serious adult
writer, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Bredsdorff died Aug. 8 at his home in Copenhagen. The cause of
death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   He was the author of what is considered a landmark biography of
Andersen, his 1975 "Hans Christian Andersen: The Story of His Life
and Work," which sought to establish the 19th century writer, known
primarily for his fairy tales, as a serious literary figure.</LD>
<TE>   "Bredsdorff presented how full of conflicts [Andersen] was and
that he also had dark sides in his life and works," said professor
Klaus P. Mortensen, a leading expert on Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, the son of a shoemaker's apprentice, wrote dozens of
fairy tale classics before his death in 1875, including "The Ugly
Duckling," "The Emperor's New Clothes" and "The Little Mermaid."</TE>
<TE>   For Danes, Andersen was always thought to have as much appeal to
adults as children--an attitude Bredsdorff sought to spread abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "The British and Americans ... have pushed him into the nursery
and locked the door on him," Bredsdorff said in the biography's
preface.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1912, the youngest son of a high school headmaster,
Bredsdorff got a degree in Danish and English languages from
Copenhagen University in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   During his student years, he was a communist and an outspoken
opponent of Nazism. He broke with the Communist Party in 1939, when
the Soviet Union invaded Denmark's Nordic neighbor Finland.</TE>
<TE>   During Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark in 1940-45, he worked
for the resistance movement as publisher of illegal leaflets and as a
fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Bredsdorff moved to England, where he was a
professor in the Scandinavian department at Cambridge University
until his retirement in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   He moved back to Denmark and continued to publish books, including
biographies on Charles Dickens and Oscar Wilde and several Danish
authors, and was a prominent figure in public debate through his
articles in the newspaper Politiken.</TE>
<TE>   Bredsdorff is survived by his wife, Anne-Lise Neckelman; two
children; and three stepchildren.</TE>

<HD>Peter W. Dauterive, 83; Executive for S&amp;L Was on Board of
L.A. Zoo</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter W. Dauterive, a savings and loan executive and community leader
who served on boards of such institutions as the Los Angeles Zoo and
the California Science Museum, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Dauterive died Friday in Los Angeles of natural causes, according
to his wife, Verna Dauterive, principal of Franklin Avenue Elementary
School.</LD>
<LD>   Dauterive was an executive with Broadway Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Assn. for 23 years, rising to executive vice president. He served the
Crenshaw area throughout his career.</LD>
<TE>   In 1972, Dauterive was the founding president and chief executive
officer of Founders Savings &amp; Loan Assn., which bought the Santa
Barbara Avenue branch of Santa Barbara Savings. In starting the new
company, he told The Times, he wanted to provide home loans for a
community scarred by the 1965 Watts riots, which had made many
financial institutions abandon the area.</TE>
<TE>   "I look on this as an opportunity to provide this community with
financial services it needed pretty badly," he said in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   After Dauterive stepped down in 1986, he formed the Peter W.
Dauterive &amp; Associates property management firm.</TE>
<TE>   Active in the Republican Party, Dauterive served as a national
convention delegate from 1976 through 1996 and served on the
Republican National Committee, the California Golden Circle, the
Ronald Reagan 10 Club and the President's Committee of Citizens for
the Republic. He was chairman of the Metropolitan Los Angeles Lincoln
Club and finance vice chairman of the State Committee to Elect the
President.</TE>
<TE>   Dauterive served as a director of the California Savings and Loan
League and director and president of the American Savings and Loan
League. Reagan named him to the National Commission for Employment
Policy, and he also served on several state commissions, including
the California Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his death, Dauterive was a director of the
California Science Center in Exposition Park, a trustee of the
Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. and a trustee of the Children's Bureau
Foundation of Southern California. He was also active in the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, the Los Angeles Figueroa
Corridor and the Access to Loans for Learning Student Loan Corp. He
was a director of the Los Angeles County Health Facilities Authority
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Highly respected in the business community, he helped break racial
barriers in many areas. In 1964, he became one of the first three
blacks admitted to the previously all-white Western Avenue Golf Club
after the late Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and colleagues ordered a halt
to discrimination on county golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New Orleans, Dauterive earned a bachelor's degree from USC
and a master's in executive management at Indiana University. He was
an Army veteran of World War II, earning the rank of staff sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   Dauterive is survived by his wife, Verna.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday at Holman United
Methodist Church, 3320 W. Adams St., Los Angeles. The family has
asked that donations be made to a charity of the donor's choice.</TE>

<HD>John Roseboro, 69; Dodgers All-Star Catcher Gained
Notoriety Following Melee in 1965</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Roseboro, an All-Star catcher for the Dodgers and a key figure
in one of the most violent brawls in baseball history, has died. He
was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Roseboro died Friday evening at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles of complications from a stroke. He had been hospitalized for
most of the last two months.</LD>
<LD>   During his final days, he received calls from many former Dodgers
and other former players, among them Sandy Koufax and Juan Marichal,
with whom his name will forever be linked.</LD>
<TE>   "He was a Dodger until the end," said his wife, Barbara
Fouche-Roseboro. "He was a man of dignity and class, and it was a
distinct honor to be his wife."</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro was hit over the head with a bat by Marichal, then a
pitcher for the San Francisco Giants, during a game Aug. 22, 1965,
setting off a bloody, 14-minute melee. For many, that fight
exemplified the bitterness of the Dodger-Giant rivalry, which began
long before both teams had moved to California from New York after
the 1957 season.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro acknowledged the incident's place in baseball history in
the first two sentences of his 1978 autobiography, "Glory Days with
the Dodgers and Other Days With Others."</TE>
<TE>   He wrote: "The thing I'm remembered best for is the Juan Marichal
incident. It's too bad, because a ballplayer would like to be
remembered for something better than a bloody brawl, but that's what
everyone always remembers, even those who weren't there or who
weren't even following baseball back in 1965."</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley remembered Roseboro for his
toughness, which was exemplified in the way Roseboro handled the
Marichal incident and his approach to the game in general.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have to say anything," O'Malley said. "His presence,
his leadership by example--he had the respect of teammates and
opposing teams because of his toughness. When the name Roseboro came
up, it got everybody's attention."</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro played in the major leagues from 1957 to 1970 with the
Dodgers, Minnesota Twins and Washington Senators (now the Texas
Rangers).</TE>
<TE>   He was named to All-Star teams in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1969, and
won Gold Gloves for his defensive play in 1961 and 1966.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro, who succeeded Roy Campanella as the Dodgers' catcher,
was behind the plate for two of Koufax's four no-hitters and caught
more than 100 games in 11 of his 14 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro, a left-handed hitter, batted .249 with 104 home runs and
548 runs batted in during his career.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, he hit a career-high 18 homers and in 1964 had a
career-best .287 average.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his modest productivity on offense, Roseboro was regarded
as one of the Dodgers' best clutch hitters. He hit only .157 in 21
World Series games, but won Game 1 of the 1963 World Series with a
three-run homer against Whitey Ford of the New York Yankees, then won
Game 3 of the 1965 World Series with a two-run single against Camilo
Pascual of the Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always like that," former Dodger first baseman Wes Parker
said. "He didn't hit for a high average, but he always seemed to come
through when we needed it most. He was a professional."</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro was born May 13, 1933, in Ashland, Ohio. His father, John
Roseboro Sr., was a mechanic, and his mother, Cecil Geraldine, took
care of John and his older brother, Jim, and worked for a department
store.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro played football and baseball at Ashland High and earned a
football scholarship to Central State College--now University--in
Wilberforce, Ohio. He played one season of football before signing
with the Dodgers for $5,000 after a workout at Crosley Field in
Cincinnati in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro began his pro career as a catcher, switched to the
outfield in his second season in the minor leagues, then went back
behind the plate. However, he made his major league debut for the
Brooklyn Dodgers in 1957 as a first baseman when he was summoned, at
24, to temporarily replace Gil Hodges.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro, nicknamed "Gabby" because he went about his business
quietly, became the Dodgers' starting catcher in their first season
in Los Angeles, after Campanella had been paralyzed in an off-season
automobile accident.</TE>
<TE>   "John emulated Roy in a lot of ways," said former Dodger pitcher
Don Newcombe, who roomed with Roseboro in 1957 and part of 1958. "He
gave his target the same way, and he was very smart calling pitches.
He knew what he was doing, so you never had to shake him off, but
both he and Roy made sure pitchers did that on purpose in order to
confuse hitters. He became very successful with that."</TE>
<TE>   But Roseboro's permanent place in baseball history was secured the
moment Marichal swung a bat at Roseboro's head.</TE>
<TE>   Marichal had earlier knocked down Maury Wills and Ron Fairly with
brushback pitches when he came to bat against Koufax in the third
inning at Candlestick Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to retaliate," Roseboro told The Times in 1997. "When
Marichal came up to bat, I tried a knockdown from behind the plate,
throwing the ball close to his nose when I returned it to the
pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected Marichal to attack me in some way. If he had said
anything to me, I had studied karate, and I was ready to annihilate
him."</TE>
<TE>   The players exchanged words, though Marichal said he'd questioned
Roseboro about his intent, then reacted in self-defense because he
thought Roseboro was going to hit him with the catcher's mask.
Roseboro said Marichal had told him, " 'You better not hit me with
that ball,' so I got up ... and here came the bat."</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro forgot about karate as a melee ensued. He suffered a
two-inch gash in the head that required 14 stitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Willie Mays telling me to stop fighting, because my
eye was out," Roseboro said.</TE>
<TE>   When the brawl ended, most of the 42,807 booed Roseboro as he was
escorted to the Dodger clubhouse, a bloody towel wrapped around his
head, by trainer Bill Buhler.</TE>
<TE>   Marichal was suspended for eight days and was fined $1,750, a
National League record at the time. Roseboro later sued Marichal for
$110,000, but settled for $7,500.</TE>
<TE>   Marichal also suffered damage to his reputation. Despite 243
victories and 2,303 strikeouts, he was not voted into baseball's Hall
of Fame until his third year of eligibility, thanks to an assist from
Roseboro.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro, who had not spoken to Marichal in 17 years, spoke up for
him in 1982, saying that he thought the pitcher, who had finished his
career with the Dodgers in 1975, was being unfairly kept out of the
Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no hard feelings on my part, and I thought if that was
made public, people would believe that this was really over with,"
Roseboro told The Times in 1990. "So I saw him at a Dodger
old-timers' game and we posed for pictures together and I actually
visited him in the Dominican [Republic]. The next year, he was in the
Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, over the years, you learn to forget things."</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro was traded to the Twins after the 1967 season and helped
Minnesota reach the American League playoffs in 1969. He made the
American League All-Star team in 1969 but was released by the Twins
after that season. He played part of the 1970 season with the
Washington Senators before finishing that season as a coach with the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro was the Angels' bullpen coach from 1972-74 and later
worked for the Dodgers as a minor league instructor.</TE>
<TE>   He also worked for the National League.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, he is survived by daughters Shelley,
Staci and Morgan Nicole; son Jaime; and five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A public memorial service will be held Saturday at 11 a.m. at
Forest Lawn Hall of Liberty, 6300 Forest Lawn Drive.</TE>

<HD>Panel Votes to Expand Burbank Airport Facilities</HD>
<DH>Policy: Commissioners act to comply with federal safety
rules. But a voter-passed city law limits new construction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To comply with new federal safety requirements, Burbank Airport
commissioners voted Monday to begin expanding terminal facilities
even if it means violating a city law that prohibits new
construction.</LD>
<LD>   The $24.5 million in contracts that the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena
Airport Authority awarded Monday means that construction of a
40,000-square-foot expansion project may start as early as this week,
said spokesman Victor Gill.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion is necessary, Gill said, to accommodate beefed-up
luggage-screening technology and improved passenger checkpoints
mandated by the Transportation Security Administration to be
implemented by the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>   However, Burbank's voter-approved Measure A so severely restricts
any airport expansion that it amounts to a moratorium on permits for
any new construction.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a major responsibility to make the airport as safe as we
can," said Jerry Briggs, who was among the six airport commissioners
who voted in favor of awarding the contracts without first obtaining
the building permits to expand the 173,000-square-foot terminal to
213,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Commissioner John Crowley said, "Assume you're walking
along a beach and you see someone drowning. A sign says city
ordinance prohibits swimming. Do you obey the sign, or do you save
that person ... and jump in?"</TE>
<TE>   The airport was caught "between a rock and a hard place," said
commission Vice President Charles Lombardo, one of two who opposed
Monday's action; a third member, Don Brown, abstained.</TE>
<TE>   Lombardo said he is personally against Measure A, but "there's
still a law on the books that the people of Burbank voted for."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a federal mandate," he added. "Then you have a conflict
with local law."</TE>
<TE>   The city of Burbank has sued to overturn Measure A, and a Los
Angeles County Superior Court judge has scheduled a hearing on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Lombardo said the airport should wait until the court resolves the
legality of Measure A, which he thought could take place within two
weeks. But other commissioners feared the litigation could drag out.</TE>
<TE>   Construction crews will need to work 24 hours a day, seven days a
week to complete the expansion in time to accommodate the new safety
requirements by year's end, so there's no time for delay, Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   The airport commission's action raised eyebrows at Burbank City
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as Measure A is the law of the land, there can be no
building permits for the airport," said City Manager Bud Ovrom.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard of a contractor who would do work without a
permit," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A, which Burbank voters approved in November, prohibits
any expansion or remodeling of the airport unless the airport imposes
a 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew on all flights and caps all future
aircraft operations and passenger growth of the airport at 10%.</TE>
<TE>   But under federal law, the airport cannot impose such restrictions
without doing an extensive study, which is underway, Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole airport issue is a mess," Lombardo said, adding that as
a commissioner, "you're damned if you do and you're damned if you
don't."</TE>

<HD>UC Davis Researcher Found Not Guilty in Trade Secrets Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WOODLAND, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In what was originally presented by prosecutors as a high-profile
trade secrets case, a jury Monday found a Chinese American researcher
at UC Davis innocent of charges that he embezzled laboratory
materials with the intent of starting up a business overseas.</LD>
<LD>   The acquittal, which was celebrated by supporters in the
California Asian American community, ended a three-month ordeal for
researcher Bin Han, a 13-year employee at the Davis campus. Han's
troubles began in May when his research contract was terminated by
supervisors at the university ophthalmology labs. On May 17, he was
arrested at home by university police and held in jail for 18 days
without bail.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very happy," said Han, who was surrounded by supporters in
the Yolo County courthouse after the verdict. "I love this country.
Now all I want to do is get back to work."</LD>
<TE>   Han has an administrative legal action for wrongful termination
pending against the university.</TE>
<TE>   In his defense, Han, who is married with two school-age children,
insisted that he had no plans to keep the university
materials--protein gels used in cornea repairs and transplants--that
police found in his home freezer. He said a round-trip plane ticket
that police found in his home was to visit his ailing mother in the
western Chinese city of Xian.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, the case was presented by Yolo County
prosecutors as an international scientific espionage plot in which
Han was accused of attempting to smuggle proprietary protein gels
from the United States to China.</TE>
<TE>   Portrayed as a flight threat, Han was ordered to surrender his
American passport.</TE>
<TE>   But the trade secret case soon evaporated after it was shown that
the protein gels and the machines used to produce them are readily
available in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong as well as other
locations.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the remaining two charges against Han were reduced from
felonies to a single charge of petty theft by embezzlement.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the controversial federal prosecution of Los Alamos
National Laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee, the case against Han
rallied support in the California Asian American community.</TE>
<TE>   Ivy Lee, leader of the Sacramento-based Chinese-American Political
Action Committee, said she hoped that the Bin Han case would embolden
the many Chinese American and Asian American researchers in
university labs.</TE>
<TE>   "I do hope it will give them some sense of security," said Lee, a
retired sociology professor at Cal State Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen so many of our people buckling under to the might of
the university. Han is a model of courage, the antithesis of the weak
and defenseless Chinese person in America. His courage inspires us
all."</TE>
<TE>   The university was steadfast Monday in defending its case against
Han.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we are very respectful of the criminal process and the
jury's decision," said UC Davis counsel Steve Drown, "we still feel
the university had a reasonable basis for the issuance of a search
warrant. We take these matters very seriously. We feel the university
police acted appropriately."</TE>
<TE>   The verdict by the jury was met with applause and cheering by an
audience of Asian American supporters and employee union leaders from
the UC campus. The defendant's wife, Hong Xia, broke down in tears.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the university witnesses in the trial walked by Han's
supporters, the group chanted, "Shame! Shame!"</TE>
<TE>   Part of Han's defense in the case was that he was being prosecuted
because of his attempts to act as a whistle-blower to the federal
Food and Drug Administration for what he described as improper or
unethical activities in the Davis labs.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which contained no Asian members, took two hours and 30
minutes to reach its verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "I think ultimately the jurors saw that the case was a shameless
attempt by the university to bully and intimidate an individual,"
defense attorney Stewart Katz said. "They were hoping to get a
criminal conviction or a hung jury to insulate them from facing any
accountability for their own actions.''</TE>

<LD>The union representing more than 8,000 Los Angeles police officers
has laid out the qualities and views it would like the city's next
police chief to have.</LD>
<LD>   In letters to police commissioners, who are screening applicants,
and Mayor James K. Hahn, who will select the chief, the Los Angeles
Police Protective League said members want a leader who will fight to
add officers and will support community policing. The chief should
realize the importance of officers' morale and be "a good listener

<LD>Former Bell Gardens City Manager Maria Chacon pleaded not guilty to
conflict-of-interest charges at her arraignment Monday in Los Angeles
Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   A pretrial hearing was scheduled for Oct. 15.</LD>

that she pressured council members to vote for her appointment as
city manager.</LD>
<TE>   Chacon, a former city councilwoman, was appointed to the
$89,000-a-year post of city manager in December 2000. She was fired
after prosecutors filed charges in June 2001.</TE>

<LD>After being jailed in Los Angeles for six months, the founder of a
worldwide network of charities agreed Monday to be extradited to
Denmark, where he has been charged with tax evasion and embezzling
about $10 million from one of his nonprofit organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Mogens Amdi Peterson, 63, leader of the Tvind organization, also
known as Humana, could be returned to Denmark by the end of this
week, said his Los Angeles lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro.</LD>
<LD>   Shapiro had been prepared to contest Peterson's extradition at a
hearing scheduled to begin Monday in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Over the weekend, however, Peterson changed his mind "against my
advice," Shapiro said. Peterson cited health problems and a desire to
confront his critics in Denmark.</TE>

<LD>Testing of DNA found on the sweatband of a baseball cap led

against a man already facing trial in a killing, a Los Angeles County
prosecutor said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Renal Wise Jr., 31, of Hawthorne was arraigned Monday on charges
of stabbing and killing Alina Casteleiro and Nicole Paquette during a
burglary and robbery on Dec. 22, 1992, in Hawthorne. The baseball cap
was found in the backyard of that home, Deputy Dist. Atty. Darrell S.
Mavis said.</LD>
<LD>   Wise also is charged with strangling Mary Ella Shoupe, 57, on
Sept. 10, 2000. He could face the death penalty if convicted.</LD>

<HD>Antelope Valley Man Pleads No Contest in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Field representative to an assemblyman may get
three years for lewd act on a boy, 12.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Antelope Valley man pleaded no contest Monday to committing a lewd
act on a 12-year-old boy.</LD>
<LD>   Howard L. Brooks, a field representative for Assemblyman Phil
Wyman (R-Tehachapi), will be sentenced by Superior Court Judge David
Mintz on Sept. 19 to three years in state prison under a plea
agreement reached between his defense attorney and prosecutors. If he
fails to appear, the judge has the discretion to sentence Brooks to a
maximum of eight years behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   The plea deal, which also requires the Quartz Hill man to register
as a sex offender, avoids a trial that was supposed to begin later
this month. Brooks' attorney did not return calls seeking comment.</LD>
<TE>   Brooks, 61, was executive director of the Antelope Valley Board of
Trade for 12 years before taking the job with Wyman's office last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Rouman Ebrahim said he was satisfied with the
outcome, especially since the young victim will no longer have to
endure a lengthy trial.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very difficult thing for anyone to go through, much
less a child," Ebrahim said. "This way, Mr. Brooks is held
accountable for his actions, and the child doesn't have to go through
the experience of testifying in court."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks was arrested last year after sheriff's investigators
received a letter that he allegedly sent to an inmate at the state
prison in Sacramento detailing sexual conduct with young boys.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that Brooks abused the child between March and
November 2000 while the boy was living with the Brooks family.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks was charged with five felony counts carrying a maximum of
17 years in prison, including committing a lewd act on a child,
continuous sexual abuse of a child, oral copulation with a minor
younger than 14, providing lewd material to a minor and possession of
child pornography.</TE>

<HD>Board Is Accused of Violating State Law</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A legal complaint filed Monday against the Ventura County Community
College District contends that the $203,000-a-year contract awarded
to Chancellor Phil Westin was approved in violation of the state's
open-meetings law and should be declared invalid.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint alleges that the district's board of trustees failed
to properly notify the public on its May 28 agenda that it would be
considering a salary increase for Westin, according to the grievance
filed on behalf of local taxpayers. The board also made the decision
in closed session, the complaint contends.</LD>
<LD>   Under the Brown Act, the state's open-meetings law, a public board
may hold closed sessions to consider the performance evaluation or
dismissal of an employee. But decisions regarding salary increases
have to be made in open session, according to the complaint.</LD>
<TE>   "The VCCD Board violated the Brown Act in considering and acting
on the salary increase issue and such action must therefore be
declared null and void," states the complaint, jointly filed by the
Quisenberry law firm of Los Angeles and Benton, Orr, Duval &amp;
Buckingham of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Leavitt and Gerard Kapuscik are named as plaintiffs in the
legal action, which demands that Westin's contract be revoked on
behalf of "all taxpayers of Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   A district spokesman was not available to comment on the
complaint, the first step before a lawsuit can be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Stevens, an attorney with Quisenberry, said the complaint
provides a way for the board to move against Westin and spend as
little taxpayer money as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "It really gives the board an opportunity and a lot more freedom
to deal with the chancellor," Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees awarded Westin a $30,000 pay increase in May, saying it
would make the chancellor's salary more competitive with other
college districts.</TE>

<HD>Budget Impasse Enters Week 8</HD>
<DH>Politics: Nearly 400,000 elderly and disabled people wait
for checks. Funding problems for other programs are looming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A partisan standoff over the California budget has claimed a new set
of vulnerable victims as it enters its eighth week: hundreds of
thousands of poor people who are blind, disabled and elderly.</LD>
<LD>   The budget impasse has prevented payment of nearly 384,000 claims
totaling $116 million to elderly, blind and disabled Californians who
participate in a program of assistance for homeowners and renters.</LD>
<LD>   The payments, which average about $302, usually go out in July or
August after a new state budget is approved. By law, the budget is
due each July 1.</LD>
<TE>   Legislators are more than seven weeks late.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we have a budget, the state of California cannot pay those
claims," said Patrick Hill, a spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board,
which handles the assistance program. "We're still processing them
and are receiving new ones, but the spending authority comes from the
budget."</TE>
<TE>   The annual payments are provided to the blind, the disabled and
people 62 or older who either rent or own homes and earn $37,119 a
year or less. The payments reimburse applicants for property taxes
they pay, either directly on their homes or indirectly through rent.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Cordova, 62, of Inglewood is one of thousands of
Californians waiting for the checks. Cordova, who is disabled and
lives on a little more than $9,000 a year, said the money would help
her cover her rent and perhaps allow her to buy a pair of stockings
and some food.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't get very much as seniors as it is," Cordova said. "We
need our money now."</TE>
<TE>   Passage of a new state budget is being delayed by a partisan fight
over a $4-billion tax and revenue package. Democrats are seeking the
new revenues, which include hiking the state excise tax on cigarettes
to $3 per pack, to help close a $23.6-billion budget gap. Republicans
want spending cuts in lieu of new taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a perfect example that real people get hurt when we
don't pass a budget," said Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver
City). "This could be, in some respects, a gradual shutdown in state
government orchestrated by my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans countered by reiterating their determination not to
adopt a budget that does not limit the size of the government.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to pass a budget, but we want to pass one that doesn't
spend more than last year's budget and doesn't increase taxes," said
Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine). "Thus far, the governor has not
made any effort to move anywhere near our requests."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved a new spending package on June 29, prompting
Davis to contend that he does not need to call a meeting of
legislative leaders to discuss the budget because the plan has
already cleared the Senate. Davis is trying to peel off the minimum
four Republicans needed to approve the budget in the Assembly, rather
than negotiate with party leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Other casualties of the standoff include needy college students
who rely on the Cal Grant Scholarships, vendors who are owed millions
of dollars for providing goods and services to the state and
lawmakers and their staffs, whose checks are being withheld.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, letters went out to 10,000 clients of a Sacramento-area
regional center that helps connect the developmentally disabled to
services including transportation, residential care and day programs,
said Robert Baldo, executive director of the Assn. of Regional Center
Agencies. The letters warn clients and their families that, if the
center does not get money soon, it will be forced to shut down Sept.
1.</TE>
<TE>   More centers are expected to send out similar closure warnings
between now and Sept. 15, unless a budget is approved. California is
home to 21 such centers serving 170,000 people. Many of the centers
have been tapping a line of credit from a private bank--an option
that is soon expected to end.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to those casualties of the political standoff, broader
problems could emerge if some resolution is not reached soon,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell has previously warned that, if a
new budget is not in place by mid-August, her ability to borrow
billions of dollars could be impeded. That money is needed to keep
the state's finances operating smoothly, she and others said.</TE>
<TE>   With no budget in place, programs and services, for the most part,
are being funded at levels for the prior year.</TE>
<TE>   In cases where the new spending package proposes to reduce
expenses by changing pharmaceutical and Medi-Cal rates, the delay in
approving a new plan is costing the state money--by one count as much
as $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   That is because any cuts in annual spending that are delayed will
have to be made up in less than a year, forcing monthly reductions
larger than would have been necessary if the reductions had been
adopted on time.</TE>
<TE>   The state could also choose to go without the savings, though that
would create other budget complications.</TE>

<HD>Childs Accused of Changing Her Story</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutor grills Simi woman charged with attempted
murder of husband. Judge warns he may declare mistrial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors launched a withering assault Monday on a Simi Valley
woman accused of trying to kill her husband for his insurance money,
saying she made contradictory allegations of abuse and numerous
misstatements to police.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Herbert
Curtis III, who is presiding over the case, warned attorneys that
unless they finish soon he may declare a mistrial.</LD>
<LD>   "At the moment, I see no end in sight," said Curtis, who
admonished both sides to shorten their arguments or risk a new trial.
"If the case goes into next week and jurors say they can't be here,
they will be excused and I'll declare a mistrial."</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee spent Monday grilling Eileen Childs,
37, about her allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the hands
of her husband, Larry Childs.</TE>
<TE>   Childs and her 19-year-old daughter, Jennifer, are accused of
setting fire to Larry Childs' mattress and then beating him with a
baseball bat last March. Prosecutors contend the motive was a
$1.4-million insurance policy that Eileen Childs planned to use to
open a Jiffy Lube station and launch her daughter's singing career.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs said her husband "snapped" the night of the fire. He
attacked her and Jennifer and the two were simply trying to protect
themselves, she said. Larry Childs, 57, has denied ever abusing his
wife and family.</TE>
<TE>   Lee asked why Eileen Childs, in a restraining order filed after
the incident, said her husband only hit her the night of the fire,
without mentioning the dozens of beatings she alleged in testimony
last week. She also asked why Childs and her daughter thought it was
so strange that her husband ran screaming from his burning bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Did it occur to you that maybe he was screaming because there was
a fire in the bedroom?" Lee asked. Childs, who said the cerebral
lupus from which she suffers seriously impairs her memory, said she
didn't know why that didn't occur to her.</TE>
<TE>   Lee also asked if Childs ever considered that her husband was
pulling her and her daughter down the hall to get them away from the
fire. But Childs said her husband hit her in the nose that night and
pulled her and Jennifer by the hair. It was then, she said, that the
two began hitting him with the baseball bat and a glass mug.</TE>
<TE>   "He was screaming like a woman, pulling me down the hallway," she
said. "It was like an unrecognizable man was in my home."</TE>
<TE>   Before the fire, Childs had cashed in a $132,000 life insurance
policy. She told the court she wanted the money to pay off her debts
in case the lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease, killed her.</TE>
<TE>   "You believed you were dying and you bought a $41,000 car? You
bought a car and you did not pay off all your debts," challenged Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Lee also noted that Childs had been divorced twice before. In one
case, she filed for divorce claiming physical abuse. "If [Larry
Childs] abused you, why didn't you divorce him?" Lee asked.</TE>
<TE>   Childs, who appeared unruffled throughout the day, said she wasn't
sure herself why she didn't get a divorce, though she filed for one
the day after the fire. She said her husband could be charming and
eloquent. He even wrote her love songs, including one called
"Firestarter."</TE>
<TE>   Lee grew increasingly frustrated with Childs' faulty memory.
Childs often confused the sequence of events from the night of fire,
correcting interviews she'd given earlier to the police.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's proceedings were marked by testiness among Lee, the judge
and the two defense attorneys. When the jury had been sent home,
defense attorney Jenny Scovis complained that Lee was hounding Childs
over her memory loss.</TE>
<TE>   "This woman has lost her memory," Scovis said. "And she [Lee] is
pounding her to death. This woman really doesn't remember."</TE>
<TE>   Lee called the charges from opposing counsel "100% untrue" and
"slander."</TE>

<HD>Cyber Cafe Laws OKd in Santa Ana Are Not as Strict as
Garden Grove's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana's City Council approved permanent regulations for cyber
cafes Monday night, requiring new security measures that were
prompted by a recent outbreak of violence linked to cyber cafes in
neighboring Garden Grove.</LD>
<LD>   Business owners must install security cameras and hire guards
under the new city ordinance regulating the cafes, which rent
computers to a mostly young clientele who play video games and chat
with friends online.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Nichols, a representative from Busquelo Aqui, one of the
businesses affected, said his company opposes having to pay for the
added security measures. "There has never been a single incident [of
crime], and I do not expect it," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Countered Councilwoman Claudia C. Alvarez: "We do want to be
preventative. The last thing we want is for someone to be killed
around the corner from your business."</TE>
<TE>   The council decided against adopting stricter regulations similar
to those recently imposed in Garden Grove, which require minors to
leave the cafes by 8 p.m. and mandate that business owners log in
customers. The Garden Grove ordinance is being challenged in court by
cafe owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Ana's ordinance is different than Garden Grove's, and I
think it is more flexible and I think it is legal," said Ben Kaufman,
Santa Ana chief assistant city attorney. Santa Ana also will not
require businesses to get a conditional-use permit, as Garden Grove
does.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana measure was approved 6 to 0, with council member
Brett Franklin absent. A final vote will be cast Sept. 3, and if
approved again, the measure will go into effect Oct. 3, Kaufman said.
The new permanent ordinance would replace interim rules put into
place six weeks ago. Businesses would have until Jan. 3 to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Cyber cafe hours have captured public attention because two recent
homicides linked to Garden Grove establishments. On June 8,
14-year-old Edward Fernandez was followed from a cyber cafe and shot
to death, and in December, a 20-year-old was stabbed to death after
leaving another cafe.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Garden Grove imposed new restrictions on the cafes in
July. However, this month, cafe owners convinced a Superior Court
judge to issue a temporary restraining order halting implementation
of the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   The judge was concerned that the measure infringed on free speech
rights and also might cause irreparable financial damage to cafe
owners. He ordered the city and business owners to try to reach a
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 18 cyber cafes in Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana, which has only four cyber cafes, established an interim
ordinance last month that required new cyber businesses to close by
midnight, close to minors by 8 p.m. on school nights and 10 p.m.
otherwise. New businesses were required to install surveillance
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   The permanent ordinance relaxes the limitations on teen visitors.
No matter the day, they can stay until 10 p.m., the same time as the
city's teen curfew, Kaufman said.</TE>

<HD>Probe Nets Captain of Fishing Boat</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Yearlong effort focuses on violations such
as exceeding catch limits and using illegal hooks. Others face
allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BODEGA BAY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The fishing boat captain had little clue that, this time, he'd become
the catch of the day. But when he stepped outside his tackle shop
Monday, state Fish and Game investigators were waiting with a net of
their own.</LD>
<LD>   Skipper Rick Powers was handcuffed by a phalanx of officers and
charged with one count of felony conspiracy to violate Fish and Game
laws and six misdemeanor infractions that include using illegal
hooks, exceeding catch limits and keeping prohibited species. The
arrest of the 48-year-old Bodega Bay captain and a 33-year-old crew
member culminated a yearlong state undercover probe known as
Operation Near Shore.</LD>
<LD>   Later this week, state officials said, misdemeanor complaints will
be filed against 13 other party boat skippers in nine counties--from
Mendocino to Orange--on a host of additional allegations that involve
wounding pelicans and seals, fudging records to avoid catch limits
and catching fish out of season.</LD>
<TE>   In a probe that swept the entire California coast, undercover
wardens posed as recreational fishermen, boarding charter boats from
San Diego and Sausalito to Emeryville and Bodega Bay to photograph
and videotape violations.</TE>
<TE>   State officials boarded vessels up to 200 miles offshore, the
limit of federal waters.</TE>
<TE>   "Wardens have been overwhelmed with complaints about party boats,"
said Warden Bob Aldrich, based in Bodega Bay. ''Guys who are over
limit for fish get encouraged to continue fishing, and their catch is
distributed to other passengers who were seasick'' or didn't catch
their limit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   No recreational anglers were targeted because they are often
unaware of state regulations, officials said. Instead, wardens went
after the people they believe should know better: boat captains and
crews.</TE>
<TE>   Operation Near Shore kicked off more than a year ago after several
amateur fisherman hired out Powers' boat. "They were just appalled by
what they saw," said Fish and Game Deputy Chief Frederick Cole. "This
guy broke just about every ethical rule of fishing on the open seas."</TE>
<TE>   Officials soon expanded their search. Eventually, other complaints
came from passengers who didn't like captains or their crews
encouraging them to violate the law. "I don't understand why party
boat skippers think they're going to take people out on the ocean and
do things that just aren't right and not expect that the passengers
aren't going to call us as soon as they get back to shore," Aldrich
said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials say the charter boat industry in California is big
and growing and that lawbreakers are helping to quickly deplete fish
numbers. Statewide, 408 boats take thousands of day trips annually
for an average price of $50 to $100 per passenger, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge industry," said Fish and Game spokeswoman Chamois
Andersen. "Our recreational fishery isn't just some Joe Blow out on a
rowboat with a hook and line. There are a lot of sophisticated boats
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen's groups on Monday were shocked by the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Rick Powers, and I don't think of him as the kind of
person you arrest and handcuff," said Zeke Grader, executive director
of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these charter boat captains up and down the coast are
responsible individuals. I hope people don't think these few are
indicative of the whole."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities on Monday characterized Powers as a leader in Northern
California's commercial fishing industry who was an advisor to state
and federal committees setting fish catch limits and other matters.
He is also a board member of the Pacific Coast Marine Fisheries
Advisory Committee and is vice president of the Golden Gate Sports
Fishing Assn., officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is someone who knew the rules and should have known better,"
said Sonoma County Deputy Dist. Atty. Brooke Halsey Jr. "If you have
someone in his capacity hiding fish and encouraging over-limit
fishing, you are endangering the entire fishery by allowing this to
continue."</TE>
<TE>   Bail for Powers was set at $100,000. If convicted, he could face
up to three years in prison. Bail for his crewman, Atsushi Yamashita,
was set at $75,000.</TE>
<TE>   The most troublesome violations, wardens say, include exceeding
limits on the number of fish, catching undersized fish and then
masking their size by fileting them before the boat returns to the
dock; using four hooks instead of the legal limit of two; and using
barbed hooks while fishing for salmon. Salmon that are caught for
sport and then released have much better odds of survival if the
fishermen used a barbless hook.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got reports of boats catching undersized salmon, chilling
them and then later throwing the dead fish overboard," Aldrich said.
"The same goes with rock fish. They take juvenile fish just a few
inches in length and cut them up for fish bait. It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to figure out that if you pull in fish 3 or 4 inches
long, you're not going to get much of a filet. So, why take that
fish? Why waste it?"</TE>
<TE>   State and federal authorities--including the National Marine
Fisheries Service, California Legislature, state Fish and Game
Commission and Department of Fish and Game--rely on accurate catch
reporting by captains to determine the health of fish populations and
allocate sensible quotas.</TE>
<TE>   Both commercial and recreational fishermen must follow such
seasonal bag limits and restrictions on the size of particular fish
as a way to ensure that no species gets overfished, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   If authorities cannot rely on boat captains to tell the truth, he
said, how can they accurately surmise how many fish are being caught?
One season's catch bears direct influence on the rules for the
following year.</TE>
<TE>   "We put a lot of reliance on those fishing logs, and inaccurate
reporting can have serious consequences," he said. "We have reports
that some skippers are deliberately not filling out logs. That's a
lot of missing information."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, negligent captains have wounded pelicans and seals
that pursue their baited hooks. Aldrich said one San Diego boat
reportedly hooked 150 brown pelicans and still did not relocate to a
safer fishing spot. He did not know how many of the birds were killed
or injured.</TE>
<TE>   "If bait hits the water and there's pelicans around, they're going
to go after it," Aldrich said. "After several of the birds are
hooked, the captain should change his tactics, even if it means
moving on. Instead, they're hooking the pelicans helter-skelter."</TE>
<TE>   He said many boats will take the chance at being caught to
increase their catch.</TE>
<TE>   "These captains know the consequences," he said. "Many are now
asking customers: 'Are any of you game wardens?' They know what
they're doing is wrong. But that doesn't stop them."</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in blue jeans, T-shirt and sunglasses, Powers on Monday
sat handcuffed in the back seat of a patrol car as officers searched
his office and the 65-foot lime-green party boat New Sea Angler that
was docked nearby. Neither he nor family members could be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in front of a gallery of pictures of amateur anglers and
their catches taken on the boat, officers confiscated numerous
three-and four-hook fishing leaders that are considered illegal
equipment in California.</TE>
<TE>   "When people boarded this boat with legal gear, this captain would
change their gear to the four-hook bait," Halsey said. "That way, he
provided them with a distinct, if illegal, advantage in catching
fish."</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Will Hear Case for Latino Market</HD>
<DH>Retail: Vote is over a liquor license for the Mexican chain
Gigante, which has alleged bias. City says its only concern is
whether the store is a regional draw.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mexican supermarket chain Gigante USA, facing resistance from
Anaheim city officials over plans to open its first Orange County
grocery store, will plead its case to the City Council tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Although the vote will deal solely with Gigante's liquor license
application, the case has attracted national media attention because
of allegations that Anaheim is discriminating against the company
because it caters to Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   Council members must decide whether to overturn the Planning
Commission's vote rejecting Gigante's liquor license application. The
council also could allow Gigante to buy an existing license from an
establishment within three-quarters of a mile.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know what's going to happen, but I hope and pray for a
positive resolution," said Gigante USA President Justo Frias.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante's supporters have produced a memo from Redevelopment
Director Elisa Stipkovich criticizing the store for being "too
specialized," with its Spanish-language signs and Spanish music piped
over loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   Stipkovich has said that memo was taken out of context and insists
her only problem with Gigante is that it will not be a regional draw
for Anaheim Plaza, a struggling, renovated, outdoor mall north of
Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   Frias said the city had persuaded him to abandon another location
that may soon house an Albertsons.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear which way the council is leaning, but at least one
council member, Tom Tait, said he supports Gigante.</TE>
<TE>   "I am for Gigante," Tait said. "I plan on voting for them. I think
they have the right to be there, and they have the right to sell what
they want to sell."</TE>
<TE>   City staff initially recommended against granting the liquor
license because there is a high concentration of liquor licenses in
the area, as well as a high crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   Now, they recommend approval if Gigante can buy an existing
license. The supermarket already has bought a license, but from an
Anaheim business outside the area.</TE>
<TE>   Tait said he does not believe there would be a correlation between
Gigante selling alcohol and the area's crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   At tonight's meeting, only four of the council's five members will
vote, setting up a potential tie.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Tom Daly has been advised to abstain from the vote because
of a conflict of interest, City Atty. Jack L. White said. Daly is a
consultant for a business association that includes Gigante. He could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "His role relates to advising the [association] about potential
sites for markets and so there's a direct nexus between what he does
in the private sector and what his decision would be," White said.</TE>
<TE>   City Council member Lucille Kring said she visited a Gigante store
in Covina and found a clean, well-stocked market with wide aisles,
friendly employees and a huge produce section.</TE>
<TE>   The liquor department, Kring said, was "extremely small"--smaller
than those at Ralphs, Vons or Pavilions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her findings, Kring said she is not sure how she will
vote. She does not support a new liquor license, but is open to a
transfer.</TE>
<TE>   City Council member Frank Feldhaus said he plans to listen to both
sides, but added, "I can guarantee I don't do anything predicated on
racial issues."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Shirley McCracken declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante has more than 200 stores in Mexico, where it is one of the
country's top retailers. In 1999, it entered the United States with
three stores in Southern California. Five more are on the way.
Anaheim, where nearly half the population is Latino, is considered a
prime place to expand.</TE>
<TE>   After coverage in local and national media, several people
contacted the city with criticism, including one man who said he
would cancel his trip to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   The United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce wrote that the
Gigante issue is "disturbing the city's international aura" and
giving the appearance of discrimination toward a Mexican-owned firm.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Coe, president and founder of the Huntington Beach-based
California Coalition for Immigration Reform, said she plans to speak
at the council meeting to voice "total opposition" to Gigante in
Anaheim because she fears it will become too much like Santa Ana,
which she says has become "the place to go" for prostitution, drugs
and fraudulent documents.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante's president scoffed at those stereotypes. Frias said
Gigante is a supermarket for families, and that where Gigante wants
to locate is already about 60% Latino.</TE>

<HD>City Tries to Predict Westerfield Verdict</HD>
<DH>Deliberations: As jury keeps reviewing testimony, opinions
vary on what long process means.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>As the jury in the David Westerfield case completed its eighth day of
deliberation on Monday, the biggest guessing game in San Diego has
become: What does it mean that the jury has taken so long?</LD>
<LD>   "It means nothing, absolutely nothing," said Colin Murray, a
former prosecutor in private practice. "It would be nice to be able
to predict what the jury is doing. It would also be nice to be able
to predict who the winner of the ninth race at Del Mar is going to
be."</LD>
<LD>   Other attorneys disagree, saying the deliberations--particularly
the extensive testimony that the jurors have asked to have read back
to them--indicate either that the panel is deadlocked or that one or
more members are not convinced on a verdict.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, for example, the jury spent most of the day listening
to a court employee read aloud the testimony of entomologist David
Faulkner, according to Judge William Mudd.</TE>
<TE>   Faulkner, who has testified in hundreds of cases, said that the
number and size of bugs found on Danielle van Dam's mummified body
suggest that the body was dumped along a rural road in the days after
Westerfield was being watched 24 hours a day by police.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Feldman, Westerfield's attorney, said this proves that
Westerfield could not have been the killer.</TE>
<TE>   According to the notes passed to Mudd by the jury foreman, jurors
have not asked to review testimony by two bug experts called by
prosecutors who disagreed with Faulkner.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine they'd go through all this process if they all
agreed," said Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence
Project at California Western School of Law in San Diego. "Nobody
spends a week listening to testimony if they're all in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Each additional day they're out gives more hope to the defense,"
Brooks added.</TE>
<TE>   Murray disagreed. "It could be that they're looking at it to feel
good about rejecting the defense theory," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed design engineer, is accused of
the kidnap and murder of 7-year-old Danielle, whose family lived two
doors away in the upscale neighborhood of Sabre Springs. If
convicted, he could face the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran defense attorney Mary Ellen Attridge said that trying to
determine how a jury is leaning "is like reading tea leaves."</TE>
<TE>   Many juries, she said, complete their task quickly because the
issue is one of degree of guilt, not the identity of the criminal,
because the evidence against the accused is overwhelming. The
Westerfield case, she said, does not fit this mold.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of cases are not whodunit cases," she said.
"Whodunit cases take longer. A jury in a case like that is likely to
be out longer because they have serious issues of fact to decide."</TE>
<TE>   Although the jury has deliberated for eight days, on several days
they were together for only a few hours. As the jury continued its
deliberations--and took its lunch break in a newly designated spot in
the courthouse to avoid the media--the judge reacted crossly to an
editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune that accused him of acting
improperly when he banished from his courtroom the field producer for
a radio talk-show that broadcast information from a closed session of
the court.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd responded: "I had no idea that, in this community, I was the
Saddam Hussein of the 1st Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Mudd refused a request from media attorney Guylyn
Cummins to release transcripts of 17 closed sessions, many of which
involved disputes between attorneys about whether certain evidence
was admissible.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need the headaches frankly of picking up the paper each
morning and reading stuff that has been excluded from the trial,"
Mudd said.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd said he is determined to divulge only information that he has
ruled admissible. "What the public has heard is what the jury has
heard," he said.</TE>

<HD>Area's June Gloom Still Hovering in August</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The June gloom that has returned to the Los Angeles area the past few
days, dropping temperatures well below normal and scattering a few
light showers, is expected to continue through Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Skies remained cloudy along the coast Monday, with only partial
afternoon clearing in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys.
Forecasters said the weather should remain gray and dank for a few
days, with gradually clearer skies and higher temperatures toward the
end of the week.</LD>
<LD>   The thermometer topped out at 75 degrees in downtown Los Angeles
on Monday, 10 degrees below the normal high of 85 and far below the
record of 106, set in 1885.</LD>
<TE>   It was even cooler at the beaches, with highs of 66 in Malibu, 67
at the Santa Monica Pier, 68 in Newport Beach and 69 in Avalon.</TE>
<TE>   Misty morning sprinkles were reported across the Southland, with
the heaviest showers in the foothills of the Santa Monica and San
Gabriel mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're having is mid-June weather pattern in the middle of
August," said Chris Stein, a meteorological technician with the
National Weather Service in Oxnard. "Normally, this is the warmest,
driest part of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Stein said a trough of low pressure has strayed down into Southern
California from the north, drawing in a deep layer of cool, moist air
from the Pacific. He said that when this 4,000-foot-thick layer of
clouds collides with the mountains that ring the Los Angeles Basin,
the moisture condenses, falling as light rain.</TE>
<TE>   The low-pressure trough is expected to begin dissipating by
Thursday, replaced by a weak ridge of high pressure. With the ridge
in place, the onshore flow of marine air will weaken, the clouds will
retreat to the coastline, and temperatures will start to climb.</TE>

<HD>High Desert Hospital Aims to Escape Ax</HD>
<DH>Medicine: The Antelope Valley facility hopes to be
persuasive today in effort to save services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the weeks since the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
approved deep cuts to the county's health-care system, a home-grown
crusade to save High Desert Hospital has sprung to life on the
county's northeastern edge.</LD>
<LD>   The High Desert Hospital Advisory Council has lobbied county
officials, drummed up community support and crafted a new business
plan that includes innovative moneymaking ventures.</LD>
<LD>   Their labors now come to this: a two-hour bus ride from the
Antelope Valley to downtown Los Angeles to attend today's public
hearings on the planned cuts. The 21 members of the hospital council
hope for a last chance to make their case and persuade supervisors to
spare their facility.</LD>
<TE>   Before the financially strapped county can move forward with plans
to close 11 clinics and end inpatient services at High Desert, it
must hold public hearings mandated by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of people countywide would be affected by the cuts,
including emergency room patients, health-care workers and the
"medically indigent," who lack insurance and depend on county
facilities for health care.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many will show today to plead with the county to
find a way to avoid the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But the hearings will undoubtedly highlight the painful choices
the county faces in reducing health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The people across the table from us are mostly bookkeepers,
accountants, finance guys," said Tom Craft, a retired Navy captain
and member of High Desert's advisory council. "They're looking at
numbers. We're looking at lives."</TE>
<TE>   County officials reply that the cuts aren't a matter of valuing
dollars over lives but an attempt to bring balance to an overextended
health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   "The county has a proud tradition of providing a very high level
of service to a very wide population," said John Wallace, a spokesman
for the county's Department of Health Services. "Unfortunately,
sources of funding that have been available in the past are either
declining or capped."</TE>
<TE>   Though county officials and health-care advocates acknowledge the
need for changes in the sprawling county health system, their visions
diverge widely on what those changes should be.</TE>
<TE>   The county envisions a health system that relies heavily on a
network of outpatient clinics to funnel the most medically needy
patients to the system's largest hospitals, County-USC Medical Center
in Boyle Heights and King-Drew Medical Center in Watts.</TE>
<TE>   But High Desert Hospital is 75 miles from County-USC, and 87 miles
from King-Drew, distances that Craft says could doom severely ill
patients forced to travel that far for a hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll die on the way," Craft said at a meeting last week.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles off Highway 14 and hidden by the barbed-wire fences of
Mira Loma Detention Center, High Desert Hospital provides some unique
services.</TE>
<TE>   The nondescript one-story building houses the only ward in the
state equipped to house the most contagious tuberculosis patients and
the only skilled-nursing program in the county system.</TE>
<TE>   High Desert, the county's sole public hospital north of the San
Gabriel Mountains, is also the one hospital targeted by the county in
the first of three possible rounds of health-care cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The county voted in June to trim $57 million from next year's
health budget, $10 million through service reductions at High Desert.
Under the county plan, High Desert would be converted to an
outpatient clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Grusing, former CEO at High Desert, says that rather than
scaling back inpatient services at the 42-year-old hospital, the
better solution is to increase them.</TE>
<TE>   Though licensed to provide 170 beds, High Desert has the budget
for 72. With only two other hospitals in the Antelope Valley, Grusing
and other members of the advisory council say eliminating beds at
High Desert is folly.</TE>
<TE>   A plan submitted by Grusing and the other members of the
hospital's advisory council to the Department of Health Services
projects that the hospital could raise more than $10 million a year
by contracting out unused beds.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing the plan, the Department of Health Services is
still urging cuts at High Desert but is now advising the county to
"conduct further evaluation and negotiations" about using the
hospital's skilled-nursing capacity.</TE>
<TE>   There is no guarantee that the High Desert's advisory council will
get to address the supervisors this morning, no guarantee that the
supervisors will change their minds about the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   But the council members are still making the trip, armed with
charts, arguments and their plan.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a tenacious bunch," Wallace said.</TE>

<HD>Man Guilty of Hospital Killings</HD>
<DH>Crime: Dung Trinh could get death for slaying three and
injuring one in Anaheim in a rage over treatment given his late
mother.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors deliberated less than three hours Monday before convicting an
Anaheim man of killing three hospital workers and wounding a fourth
during a shooting rampage at West Anaheim Medical Center in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana Superior Court jurors found Dung D. Trinh, 46, guilty on
three counts of first-degree murder and one of attempted murder, as
well as the special circumstance of multiple murder. Trinh, who could
face the death penalty, will return to court next week for the
penalty phase.</LD>
<LD>   Trinh's lawyer did not dispute the fact that her client pulled the
trigger during the Sept. 14 rampage.</LD>
<TE>   However, Deputy Public Defender Sharon Petrosino said Trinh was
suffering a mental and physical breakdown because of his mother's
death that morning. Trinh, she said, believed that the hospital had
neglected his ailing mother and hastened her death.</TE>
<TE>   That argument will play a key role in Trinh's sentencing.
Petrosino has argued that Trinh is not a cold-blooded killer and
consequently does not deserve the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors told the seven-woman, five-man jury that Trinh
acted willfully and deliberately, loading up on ammunition and
packing two guns before security cameras recorded him walking through
the hospital and firing at employees.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Bruce Moore told jurors that
Trinh's actions were not random. Instead, he said, Trinh coolly
waited for targets before firing and initiated the slaughter without
arguing or complaining.</TE>
<TE>   Those killed were hospital maintenance director Ronald Robertson,
50; nurse's aide Marlene Mustaffa, 60; and pharmacist Vincent
Rosetti, 50.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the shooting, Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas announced
that he planned to seek the death penalty against Trinh--and would
against anyone else who goes on a killing rampage. The defense had
sought to remove the district attorney's office from the case,
alleging that Rackauckas had a conflict of interest because he had
visited his ailing father at the same hospital two days before the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Petrosino told jurors that Trinh's despair was heightened by the
fact that the hospital could not offer Vietnamese translators to his
72-year-old mother.</TE>
<TE>   Trinh's mother had died at another hospital the morning of the
shootings, but her hip had been replaced at West Anaheim Medical
Center months earlier. Petrosino said it was then that the elderly
woman's health began to fail.</TE>
<TE>   The trial began two weeks ago. After closing arguments, the jury
began deliberating about 10:15 a.m. After an hour lunch, the panel
announced its verdict at 2 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Funding OK Is Expected for O.C. Airport Security</HD>
<DH>Safety: Officials hope to speed installation of
bomb-screening devices to meet federal deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Racing to comply with federal airport security rules that take effect
Dec. 31, Orange County supervisors are expected today to spend $15.5
million to install a dozen bomb-detecting baggage screening devices
at John Wayne Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes as airports across the nation are questioning
whether they will make the deadline set last year by President Bush
to screen all checked and carry-on baggage for explosives.</LD>
<LD>   John Wayne Airport managers on Monday asked the Board of
Supervisors to take emergency action so the equipment could be
installed without normal bidding procedures. The streamlining is
needed, officials said, to make sure all the security systems are
ready for operation by the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>   The airport has the funds available to make the security upgrades
now and will seek a reimbursement from the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "John Wayne Airport is committed to providing a safe and secure
facility for the traveling public and all visitors to the airport,"
Airport Director Alan Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Hensel Phelps Construction Co., which airport officials have
recommended for the job, completed similar security projects in
Denver, Los Angeles, San Jose, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and
Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   The detection equipment should cause passenger delays of no more
than 15 minutes as their bags are checked, John Wayne officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Without the equipment, passengers would have to wait up to 10
hours to board flights while their bags were searched by hand--as
would be required under the federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of three of California's largest airports told a
U.S. Senate committee this month that they were having difficulty
meeting the bag-screening deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for airports in Sacramento, San Francisco and San Diego
complained that the rule requires the costly installation of devices
that cause long lines, crowding and confusion. The equipment is
cumbersome and has an unacceptably high false-alarm rate, those
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Green, chief operating officer for Los Angeles World
Airports, told the committee that its four airports could meet the
Dec. 31 deadline if enough machines were available and enough federal
employees were available to operate the equipment. The agency
oversees Los Angeles International, Ontario International, Palmdale
and Van Nuys airports.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at LAX declined Monday to say how many devices it would
need to meet the federal mandate, citing security concerns.</TE>

<HD>Assembly OKs Classes on Gay Foster Children</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Bill on sensitivity training passes on party
lines after heated debate. Lawmakers also vote to bring state in line
with U.S. law on abortion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON ORTIZ and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Assembly passed a bill Monday to establish gay and
lesbian sensitivity training for foster parents, but only after an
acrimonious debate that exposed some of the cultural and political
fissures regarding homosexuality that divide the state's elected
leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Entering into the last two weeks of the legislative session,
legislators also approved a measure that would strengthen state
abortion law and allow nurses to prescribe so-called morning after
drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The day's most impassioned debate, however, was over the foster
care legislation.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans decried the sensitivity training bill as a piece of
social engineering that would move the state one step closer to
sanctioning immorality.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats brushed aside the attacks as narrow-minded and
insensitive.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia) fired the opening salvo
in the 30-minute debate with a plea to his colleagues to turn back
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not OK to be gay," he said, predicting that religious groups
that are active in foster care programs will back away from
supporting the system if the bill becomes law.</TE>
<TE>   "You think you've got a foster care crisis now, pass this and see
what happens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mountjoy's remarks drew a sharp response from Assemblywoman Gloria
McLeod (D-Chino). "Do you think it's OK for gay and lesbian foster
children to be thrown away? Is that what you want?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, AB 2651 by Assemblywoman Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park),
requires the state Department of Social Services to expand its foster
parent education program to include sexual orientation sensitivity
training.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, state officials would be required to offer the
training, but prospective foster parents could opt not to go through
the portion that deals with sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also mandates that the Department of Social Services
recruit gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender adults to become
foster parents to children with similar sexual orientations.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly passed the bill along party lines, 41 to 28, and it
already has cleared the state Senate. As a result, all that is
required for it to become law is Gov. Gray Davis' signature. Davis
has not taken a position on the measure, according to a spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Over the objections of Republicans, the Assembly's Democratic
majority also approved abortion legislation that puts state law in
harmony with the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision,
and allows nurses to prescribe the "morning after" pill.</TE>
<TE>   Abortion rights groups support the measure by Sen. Sheila Kuehl
(D-Santa Monica), arguing that it is time for the state's abortion
laws to mirror federal standards.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would eliminate state laws that are inconsistent with the
Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision and would add language intended
to incorporate that decision into the state code.</TE>
<TE>   According to proponents, that would protect abortion rights in
California if the U.S. Supreme Court were ever to roll back the
standards established by Roe vs. Wade.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of California have made it very clear .... This is a
woman's choice," said Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa
Barbara), citing the electorate's support for abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   But GOP legislators opposed to legalized abortion called it yet
another step toward the legitimization of a court ruling, and a
practice that they will never support.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the proper roles of government is to protect those who can
least protect themselves ... in this case, the unborn child in the
womb," said Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park).</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tim Leslie (R-Tahoe City) attempted to introduce an
amendment to block the one provision that expands abortion law by
letting nurses prescribe nonsurgical abortion drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Only doctors can now prescribe the medication.</TE>
<TE>   His effort was rebuffed by Democrats on a party line vote, and the
measure passed, 44 to 23. It now goes to Davis, who is expected to
sign it.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * Ending months of gridlock, the Assembly Utilities and Commerce
Committee approved legislation requiring utilities to generate or
acquire at least 20% of their electricity from wind and solar power
or other forms of renewable energy.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists hailed the passage of the measure, SB 1078 by
Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford), which is one of their biggest
priorities of the year.</TE>
<TE>   It had been stuck in committee, where San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and
other large utilities had fought it with the help of committee
Chairman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles). Wright ultimately supported
an amended version that requires the companies to increase their
renewable energy portfolio by at least 1% a year.</TE>
<TE>   * The Senate passed a bill by Senate Republican floor leader Jim
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga that would authorize local jail and state
prison officers to use reasonable force to extract DNA from felons
who refuse to provide it voluntarily. The vote on the bill, SB 1242,
was 39 to 0.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, DNA from violent criminals such as murderers and
rapists is required to be taken and filed in a law enforcement
database.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Department of Corrections estimates there are 300
hard-core convicts who refuse to give up their DNA, mostly from fear
that it would expose their participation in other crimes, many of
them unsolved for years.</TE>
<TE>   Violent convicts must give at least two specimens of blood and a
saliva swab. Use of reasonable force to obtain the DNA would be
videotaped.</TE>
<TE>   * The Senate approved legislation, SB 1670, by Sen. Jack Scott
(D-Altadena) that would make it illegal to sell any gun safety
mechanism that is not approved by the state Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Violators would be subject to a $500 fine for the first offense
and a maximum $5,000 fine for a third or subsequent violation. The
measure passed, 25 to 12.</TE>

<HD>Just Plain Folks Run for Mayor</HD>
<DH>Election: Most of the 10 hopefuls in Valley city race are
not politicians, and some proudly defy typical campaign logic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would have been a sight to behold: Wayne "T-Bear" Crochet, a
candidate for San Fernando Valley mayor, toddling down the campaign
trail in a polar bear suit.</LD>
<LD>   But Crochet, nicknamed Teddy Bear for his love of children's books
and music, failed to qualify for the Nov. 5 ballot. Several
signatures on his nominating papers were deemed invalid, sending
T-Bear's campaign into hibernation.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves 10 other contenders for an office whose very existence
remains questionable. If voters reject Valley cityhood--which must
win majority approval both in the Valley and in Los Angeles as a
whole--the mayor's post would evaporate along with the city it would
represent.</LD>
<TE>   That creates an unusual political dynamic, and even without
T-Bear, the race already defies many political conventions.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates plan to raise little or no money. Hardly
any of them have hired campaign workers or lined up endorsements.
Only two--Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) and Mel Wilson, a
real estate agent--say they have collected more than $30,000 in
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   By and large, the candidates are just ordinary folks, hoping to
make the Valley a better place. They're polite but unpolished,
excited by a call from a reporter, not really expecting to win.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the field has been shaped by the political calculations
of secession. Municipal labor unions have threatened to never support
those who run in the proposed city, chasing some possible candidates
from the arena. And much of the city's business and political
establishment is lined up against the idea as well. As a result, many
big-name politicians have elected to sit out this race.</TE>
<TE>   Left are mostly novices with an array of views and campaign
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Computer Campaign</TE>
<TE>   So far, Marc Strassman is proud to report, his biggest campaign
expense has been the six bucks he paid Kinko's to copy some fliers.
Strassman, a 54-year-old computer consultant whose mayoral platform
includes solar energy and Internet access for all, directs his
campaign from a Dell laptop in his Valley Village apartment.</TE>
<TE>   It's a one-room operation, with a rumpled bed and 15 paper bags
crammed with books (Strassman's version of a bookcase) alongside his
computer table. Strassman pecks away at the keyboard so often that
most of the letters have worn off.</TE>
<TE>   Every morning, the Harvard graduate runs his name through an
Internet search engine to see if he has been mentioned in the news.
If so, he creates links from his Web site to the articles.</TE>
<TE>   "The laptop is mightier than the lawn sign," Strassman said. "If
one person with no money and no help can get himself elected, imagine
how much more efficiently the city could be run."</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away in North Hollywood, Gregory Roberts has yet to
start actively campaigning. He's still miffed that the county
registrar refused to list his occupation on the ballot as "Public
Corruption Fighter."</TE>
<TE>   "I fight corruption," said Roberts, a former freelance writer who
said he has been sidelined for several years with epilepsy.
"Sixty-five percent of that whole City Hall operation is corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Asked for an example, he pointed to what he considers the
totalitarian rule of the guards at the County Hall of Administration
(which, as a county building, is beyond the reach of City Hall.)</TE>
<TE>   "They got a 'No Food or Drink' sign there," Roberts said. "Their
main obsession seems to be telling elderly ladies they can't have
orange juice in their purse. They're a law unto themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Gadfly on the Stump</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the 82-year-old Leonard Shapiro, a longtime (and
loud) government critic who has spent much of the last two decades
bellowing into a microphone at the City Council and county Board of
Supervisors during public comment periods.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the only guy in the whole city who knows what the hell is
going on," said Shapiro, who keeps five filing cabinets filled with
newspaper clippings and city audits. "Richman's up in Sacramento. He
means well, but he has no idea what's happening." Richman is a likely
front-runner with modest name recognition and more than $100,000 in
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates have yet to hold a single campaign event.</TE>
<TE>   One notable exception is David Hernandez Jr., an insurance
adjuster who is also the Republican candidate in the Valley's 28th
Congressional District. (He's pretty sure he's going to lose that
race--he's running against Howard L. Berman, who has held office for
20 years.) Hernandez, who wore a sombrero to one secession news
conference, has spent the last eight months traveling across the
Valley to attend community meetings.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, he showed up in Lake View Terrace, where
residents had gathered to hear filmmakers describe a plan to shoot an
action flick (working title: "Helldorado"), complete with a cattle
stampede, at Hansen Dam. One woman asked whether the plot included
any explosions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the idea of doing something that might entail a
fireball," conceded Murray Miller, the movie's location manager. But
he said it probably wouldn't be so loud as to rattle people's
windows.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez sat quietly throughout the hourlong meeting. Another
mayoral candidate, Jim Summers, a real estate salesman, slipped in
near the end and stood in the back, chewing gum.</TE>
<TE>   Finally Hernandez piped up: "How does this particular project
benefit this community?"</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Nina Royal, a local activist who helped start the
Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood council, scolded him.</TE>
<TE>   "It benefits the people who work here, David!" she said. "One of
the problems with the city of Los Angeles is, they've made it almost
impossible to do business here. That's why people are fleeing."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said he just wanted the community to get accurate
information about the project.</TE>
<TE>   Summers ambled over and started chatting with Hernandez and Royal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just one of those guys who listens in the back of the room,"
he said. The only reason he's running for mayor, Summers added, is to
urge more local control over land use.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody takes my platform, they can gladly be mayor," he
chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   The First Big Chance</TE>
<TE>   Far from hitting the ground running, some candidates seem to be
waiting for invitations to appear. Their first big chance came last
week, at a Granada Hills seafood luncheon hosted by the Valley's
United Chambers of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   All the mayoral candidates were asked to give three-minute
speeches, but only seven showed up: Hernandez, Shapiro, Strassman,
Summers, Wilson, alarm company manager Bruce Boyer, and auditor Henry
Divina.</TE>
<TE>   Earnest enthusiasm abounded. Candidates fumbled for the
microphone, praised the secession group Valley VOTE for bringing them
this far, and vowed to fight for accountable government, Internet
access and all the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer, casual in black jeans and a fanny pack, told the audience:
"I want a new city so we're a new city. Not just a different name. A
new city." He said he hopes to bring the Valley freedom, security and
prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   He was followed by Divina, who promised to slash the city's
business tax, hire more police and set up a telephone hotline
"directly to the mayor's office," so all 1.35-million Valley
residents could voice service complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a favorite of many business-minded secessionists and the
last to speak, grabbed the mike and strode closer to the crowd.
"Quality leadership, strong neighborhoods," he said. "That's the
theme of my campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was the only candidate to appeal for money--a much-needed
resource for the cash-poor secession movement. Separatists have
collected only a tiny fraction of the $4 million they once vowed to
raise, and they're counting on candidates to help make up the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley mayoral field also includes Benny Bernal, a bus driver
and union activist. (He missed the luncheon, he said, because he was
mediating a gang dispute in the northeast Valley.)</TE>
<TE>   No matter who wins the election, most of the would-be mayors seem
delighted with their moment in the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "I calculate that I'm in fifth place, based on the news stories,"
Strassman said, his eyes lighting up behind his thick glasses. "It's
the classic existential quest."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ojai voters can't be told that "worthwhile projects" in the city
could still be built if a growth-control measure on the November
ballot is approved, a judge has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Measure C would require the City Council to reject any future
development that would increase traffic in the rural city of 7,800.
In ballot arguments, initiative supporters wanted to include a
sentence that a yes vote would still allow Ojai voters "to approve
worthwhile projects that generate traffic that cannot be mitigated."</LD>
<LD>   The council, which opposes the measure, challenged the statement
as misleading and asked a judge to delete it. Superior Court Judge
Steven Hintz agreed with the city in a ruling issued Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no voter approval for any project. All projects would
have to be denied," said Katherine Stone, an attorney representing
the city. "We felt really good that at least that language was taken
out."</TE>
<TE>   Stone contends the city will be unable to undertake a number of
proposed projects if the traffic initiative is approved. Those
include planned expansions of a community hospital, the city's
library and the elegant Ojai Valley Inn, a primary source of tax
revenue for the city.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure's supporters say desired projects could still be
built--as long as voters give the council permission to alter
existing traffic standards.</TE>
<TE>   "We included that provision, but the judge was not familiar with
it so he went along with their argument that the initiative does not
directly say that," said Stan Greene of Citizens to Preserve the
Ojai, the measure's sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders contend the initiative is an attempt to halt all
growth in what is already the smallest and slowest-growing city in
Ventura County. But supporters say they were forced to place the
initiative on the ballot because the city was not addressing a
worsening traffic problem.</TE>
<TE>   They point to the city's approval of a 23-unit condominium complex
in the downtown area as evidence of bad decision-making. The city
proceeded with the Los Arboles project over the objections of
environmentalists, who said it would bring too much traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The legal tussle over Los Arboles is continuing. Citizens to
Preserve the Ojai argued in a separate court hearing last week that a
second environmental study analyzing the project is flawed and should
be thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   A decision by Judge Melinda Johnson is expected in coming weeks.</TE>

<HD>Well-Intentioned Samaritan Halts Shooting by Tackling a
Gun-Toting Actor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man with a gun was chasing three people through an alley in San
Diego the other day when an onlooker jumped on his back. Cut! The
onlooker didn't realize he had interrupted the shooting of a scene
from a movie based on the old TV series "Hunter."</LD>
<LD>   A city film commission rep told columnist Diane Bell of the San
Diego Union-Tribune that neither the good Samaritan nor the actor was
injured. Then again, the actor has bumped bodies before. He is
6-foot-5-inch Fred Dryer, the ex-L.A. Rams football star.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes bad Samaritans are star-struck too: The makers of the
"Columbo" TV show once converted a vacant store on Wilshire Boulevard
into a make-believe jewelry shop, stylish nameplate and all. After
the first day of shooting there, some fake jewels were left in the
front window. That night, burglars broke in and stole the unprecious
gems.</LD>
<TE>   Modern living: Today's fashionable exhibits (see photos) include:</TE>
<TE>   * An apartment that Ed Carter of Culver City suspects has "a
tenant in the attic."</TE>
<TE>   * A home that might be in need of a ceiling (submitted by Brian
Sullivan of Santa Ana Heights).</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, a restroom that would seem uninviting at first
glance. But the sign was in Denmark, explained Shirley Myers of La
Canada, and what we'd take for an ominous adjective actually means
"bath."</TE>
<TE>   "Duh!" award winner? After I bought a pair of socks, I at first
thought the label was telling me not to put them on over shoes (see
accompanying). But For Bare Feet is the name of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason not to drink and drive: The crime log of the L.A.
Independent reported that a driver became upset when someone pulled
in front of her into a parking space. The angry motorist "shook her
soda can at the man, getting him and his car wet," the police log
said. "The man became angry and kicked the door of the woman's car."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Insults of the Day: Recent stories about the possible moving
of the Academy Awards ceremonies to New York wouldn't have upset the
character played by Maggie Smith in Neil Simon's "California Suite."</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, Smith is a grouchy actress jetting into town from
England for the Oscars when she hears the flight attendant announce
the plane will soon be "landing in Los Angeles." Says Smith: "I
suppose we must?"</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, played by Michael Caine, is reminded by the
stewardess about the no-smoking sign. Caine points to the
smog-shrouded city below and says: "I thought it was meant for the
people down there."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The other day, Bill Fawcett sent along a "tide"
reading for Beverly Hills that appeared on the Weather Channel's
online site. No mystery there, writes Deloris St. John. "It was for
the swimming pools and spas," she surmised.</TE>

<HD>Cable Offerings Can't Match Rigas Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rigas family had homes in all the best banlieues of Mexico, the
Rocky Mountains and Manhattan, and three private jets to take them
there, or on an African safari, or to the south of France--much of
that bankrolled, so the federal court documents say, by the duped
stockholders of Adelphia Communications.</LD>
<LD>   But a letter to "Dear Valued Customer" (they must have run out of
the "Dear Sucker" form) informs me that my monthly cable fee is going
up--excuse me, adjusting--by $2.37 a month.</LD>
<LD>   While they ran Adelphia, the Rigases--again according to court
papers--lavished almost $13 million of company money on their own
private golf course; evidently that $700,000 country club membership
wasn't enough for one of the Rigas boys to chip away at his handicap.</LD>
<TE>   But Los Angeles City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel couldn't for the
longest time get a working cable box to replace her broken one,
because Adelphia hasn't got the dough to keep its system in repair.</TE>
<TE>   John Rigas, the company founder, the son of immigrants who grew up
above the family hot dog joint, couldn't scrape by on a $1.9-million
annual salary, and started sucking so much money out of the company
that his own son had to put him on an unreported $1 million-a-month
limit.</TE>
<TE>   But the good employees of Adelphia, about 3,000 of them in
Southern California--like the stalwart Bill Rosendahl and the staff
of his invaluable public affairs show--saw the value of their
nest-egg stocks drop by 99%, and wonder how long they'll still have
paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   So let's sum up: I am one of a million-point-two Adelphia
customers in Southern California--about a fifth of Adelphia's total
nationwide. In my neighborhood, as in others, it's the only cable
service I can get.</TE>
<TE>   In the years that the Rigases have allegedly treated themselves to
more than two billion bucks in "off-balance-sheet" loans (down at the
Burrito King they'd call that dipping into the till, and they'd call
the cops), my cable service has shriveled as my cable rates have
risen from about $24 a month to--hang on, let me look at my checkbook
here--to about $400 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Okay, I'm exaggerating that part. But give it another year, and I
may be right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I love Angelenos. We swan through quake and riot and no pro
football with hardly a peep. But mess with our cable, and the phones
and computer lines overflow like the Danube.</TE>
<TE>   A man called the city attorney's office from his car after getting
his "adjustment" letter. "I'm furious," he complained, "about
Adelphia and I'm on my way to court to file my own lawsuit, but I
need their proper corporate name."</TE>
<TE>   A Tarzana e-mail to Councilman Dennis Zine read, and very
politely, considering, "Please consider non-renewal of the Adelphia
cable contract.... Adelphia has the lowest level of high-speed
Internet access, charges the highest fees for the least amount of
programs/services...."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of callers--hundreds of voters--want to know: Why are we
dealing with Adelphia, especially after it filed for bankruptcy
protection? Will my monthly check go for a Dream Team defense of the
Greed Family? Should I stop paying my bill in protest? Where can I
buy a set of rabbit ears? (That's my question; it may come to that.)</TE>
<TE>   Zine met the senior Rigas last year at a big lunch here. "I
thought, 'What a wonderful man.' You hear his story.... Then you see
how he looks in handcuffs."</TE>
<TE>   Zine, who just got redistricted into Adelphia territory, is joined
by the others on the information technology committee, Councilmen
Mark Ridley-Thomas and Jack Weiss, to find out what kind of wiggle
room the city has in this, being as handcuffed by federal cable
regulations as the Rigases were by federal agents. They can't even
find out with one phone call how much Adelphia rates have gone up
compared to other L.A. cable companies. (If it helps, gentlemen, I'll
dig out my canceled checks.)</TE>
<TE>   How did cable get this high and mighty? I wanted to hunt for clues
on the city's ethics Web site--a repository of records on lobbyists,
contributions and connections--but it was down. It's probably powered
by Adelphia Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases, like Charles Keating and his campaign against naughty
words and pictures, primly congratulated themselves for being too
moral to profit by airing a soft-porn cable channel. Then, like
Keating, they may have gone on to commit the greater obscenity of
ripping off the unworldly and unwary.</TE>
<TE>   If the Rigases ever go to prison, you just know it'll be one of
those honor farms with a low-carb menu and cable. So let's really
punish them: for starters, no golf channel. And since they're such
cable geniuses, let them become their own programming. Train a
cell-cam on each of them, 24 hours a day. Their lives, their
loves--all Rigases, all the time.</TE>
<TE>   That, I'd pay premium for.</TE>

<HD>Toddler Stable After Attack; Pit Bull to Die</HD>
<DH>Mauling: Mother thanks La Habra neighbor and roofers who
saved her boy from dog. Police are still investigating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Family members crowded into the pediatric intensive-care unit of UCI
Medical Center in Orange on Monday to show support for a critically
injured 2-year-old boy mauled by a pit bull over the weekend.
Authorities said the dog's owner has agreed to have the animal
euthanized.</LD>
<LD>   John Michael Macias-Drisner of Orange remains in stable condition
after three hours of surgery Saturday night following the mauling
that day in La Habra.</LD>
<LD>   "I really want to thank the neighbor and the roofers who were able
to help," Suzette Macias, the boy's mother, said of those who pulled
him from the dog. John Michael was attacked as he and his grandmother
returned with other relatives from a garden shop Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   "If it weren't for them," the mother said, "this miracle would not
have happened. The doctors said the dog was set to kill him."</TE>
<TE>   Boy Has Nightmares</TE>
<TE>   Though responding well to their voices, relatives said, the
toddler is having nightmares. "He's just very clingy to me right
now," Macias said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was expected to be transferred to the hospital's pediatric
ward within two days; doctors said the greatest danger now is
infection.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the dog ran past several adults and straight for
the boy. Annette Briers of Huntington Beach, John Michael's aunt,
said grandmother Rosalie Macias tried to protect her grandson by
lifting him above her head, but she lost her balance and fell as the
dog ran between her legs.</TE>
<TE>   The dog sank its teeth into the boy's head, tearing away part of
his scalp.</TE>
<TE>   The toddler also suffered lacerations to his forehead and right
cheek, and punctures to his chest, legs and eyelids, said Dr. Jay
Calvert, UC Irvine assistant professor of clinical surgery in the
division of plastic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   He said a CAT scan of the boy's skull showed bruising, but no
evidence of brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   "The injuries were of a very vicious nature," Calvert said. "Based
on the amount of dead tissue, and the extent of the injuries ... if
this attack was allowed to continue we wouldn't be talking about the
patient Michael Macias, but the fatality.</TE>
<TE>   "Pit bulls kill people; we know that," he said. "It's not a big
secret."</TE>
<TE>   The dog was subdued by neighbor Don Beaman and two roofers working
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The dog's owner, Jonathan Beasley, 21, relinquished ownership of
the animal, which is being held for four days in mandatory quarantine
before being put to death, authorities said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   No Charges Filed</TE>
<TE>   No charges have been filed against Beasley pending further
investigation, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll continue to see if there are other circumstances, such as
whether the dog was trained to attack," said Cindy Knapp, La Habra
police spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest [impact] may not be so much criminal liability but
civil liability."</TE>
<TE>   Beasley could not be reached for comment Monday, but family
members expressed shock at the dog's behavior and denied that it had
ever been aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "This has never happened before," said Beasley's cousin Jennifer
Kenison of Norwalk.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is just really heartbroken, and our prayers go out to
the little boy and his family."</TE>
<TE>   3,000 Bites This Year</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 people have suffered dog bites in Orange County this
year, and about 4,000 were attacked last year, said Kathy Francis,
Animal Care Services spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen a huge increase," Francis said. "We seem to go
seasonally. It generally peaks in the summer months and declines in
the winter."</TE>
<TE>   Dog lovers in the La Habra neighborhood Monday worried that this
latest attack will add to the reputation for viciousness the pit bull
breed has earned in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear it on the news that the breed is vicious, but it's
really all about the owners," said neighbor Michael Beaman, Don's
son, as he patted his own 2-year-old pit bull, Jake. "They really are
beautiful dogs. I love them."</TE>

<HD>Forum Explores Police Abuses</HD>
<DH>Misconduct: Eight members of Congress come to Inglewood to
discuss the problem and possible solutions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The eight members of Congress who came to Inglewood High School on
Monday hailed from five states, each bringing their constituents'
horror stories of police misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   They told of brutal beatings and shootings and of confessions
coerced from innocent men after hours of interrogation in Illinois,
Michigan, Virginia, Alabama and California.</LD>
<LD>   They had a receptive audience: an auditorium half-filled with
people who had seen the July 6 videotaped beating of Donovan Jackson.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson sat with his family in the second row, listening as
lawyers, politicians and law enforcement experts talked about how to
prevent and combat police misconduct, which Rep. Earl Hilliard
(D-Ala.) called "a national problem."</TE>
<TE>   The forum offered no new insights into the lawsuits that resulted
from Jackson's beating, and Jackson did not speak. But the forum,
which attracted about 300 people, gave experts a chance to discuss
police brutality.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd favorite wasn't Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca or
state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer--who detailed how their departments
handle abuse claims--but Preston Gilstrap, the chairman of the
National Black Police Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Gilstrap said the solution to police brutality is simple: "When
you start sending police officers to jail, excessive force will
stop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We must stop putting lipstick on this gorilla," Gilstrap repeated
often, to howls and applause from audience members.</TE>
<TE>   The eight members of Congress are all members of the Congressional
Black Caucus, and the forum was organized by Rep. Maxine Waters
(D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   The forum also sought to garner support for House Bill 3981, the
Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act. If passed, the bill would
commission several studies on police brutality, increase spending to
prosecute cases, train officers and collect data on racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Several people said they were glad the forum examined police
misconduct issues. Some, including an Inglewood resident, Byron
Scott, lamented that it focused on experts and didn't offer more time
for public comment.</TE>
<TE>   Scott said he wished the caucus members could have heard more "of
what the brothers are really feeling."</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Curb Banks' Data Sharing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Leading Democratic lawmakers have reached agreement on legislation
that would give California consumers the power to prevent banks from
selling or trading their personal information.</LD>
<LD>   The compromise by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) and
Assemblyman Joe Nation (D-San Rafael), who had pushed rival
protection plans, could pave the way for lawmakers to put a privacy
bill on the desk of Gov. Gray Davis before the Legislature adjourns
at month's end. Davis pledged in his State of the State address to
sign a privacy bill this year.</LD>
<LD>   "If you do not want your information shared, sold or otherwise
used, you have that right," Nation said.</LD>
<TE>   Banks, insurers, credit card companies and other financial
services firms, however, remain firmly opposed to the new measure,
and the lawmakers acknowledged that they still lack the votes to get
it through the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a very powerful force in this building," Speier said of
the financial firms' clout in the state Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   A recent federal law that broke down some of the traditional
barriers between financial institutions in hopes of creating a more
vibrant marketplace of services already requires banks and other
firms to let consumers "opt out" of having their information shared
or sold.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal law does not cover much of the information sharing
within huge conglomerates, which has become increasingly common
because of consolidation. And the cumbersome notices now being sent
out have been widely criticized by consumer groups, which contend
that the notices are intentionally misleading and designed to end up
in the wastebasket.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise bill, SB 773, would increase privacy protections by
requiring firms to send consumers simple, clearly written
notices--not the legalese now favored by banks and insurers, which
she said requires a graduate degree to comprehend. The notices would
have to be approved by the attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   If a firm wanted to share a California customer's financial
information within the "family of companies" in its corporate
umbrella, or with another firm, it would have to first send that
customer the state-sanctioned opt-out notice.</TE>
<TE>   And if a firm wanted to share a customer's information with a
third party for non-financial purposes, it would first have to obtain
the customer's written consent--a stricter, "opt-in" standard. The
bill also increases penalties for identity theft, the growing crime
of stealing a person's financial information. Consumer and
privacy-rights groups, which have been pushing for tougher
protections on financial data for several years, lauded the
compromise measure as a significant step forward.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should have their personal financial information, their
credit card numbers, their spending habits, sold to the highest
bidder without their consent," said Betsy Imholz of Consumers Union.</TE>

<HD>Racers a Drag for Residents</HD>
<DH>Driving: Police cite 28 in what has become a regular event
on PCH near Ventura.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With electronic gates and bougainvillea hedges to guard their 70
homes, residents of Solimar Beach Colony north of Ventura have come
to expect a little peace and quiet.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not Malibu," said Jenney Colborn, president of the
colony's homeowner association. "This is a colony that is quiet.
Retired people and families."</LD>
<LD>   But the community's tranquillity was shattered early Sunday
morning by screeching tires and police sirens.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities swooped in to bust up an illegal drag-racing
competition, sending street racers scurrying--some scaling fences and
others scrambling through an electronic gate of the gated community.</TE>
<TE>   A few followed close behind residents' vehicles entering the
community before ditching their souped-up cars and fleeing, with
Ventura County sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol
officers in pursuit, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Once the commotion subsided and a few people were pulled from the
bushes, 28 citations were handed out, CHP Officer Dodd Stolworthy
said.</TE>
<TE>   One car was impounded for vehicle code violations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also recovered a video camera containing footage of
the illegal races, although no one had come forward to claim the
equipment, Stolworthy said.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime residents of the beachside community along the Ventura
Freeway said they were more curious than concerned by the flurry of
noise that jolted them awake.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good thing I didn't get ahold of them," homeowner Tina
Osborne said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe they would be so stupid. They could have killed
someone."</TE>
<TE>   Residents say the revving engines and screeching tires recently
have become a weekly event behind their homes, on a strip of Pacific
Coast Highway stretching to Emma Wood State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Several said they have expressed their concerns to deputies and
CHP officers who patrol the coastal strip from Silver Strand Beach in
Oxnard to the Santa Barbara County line.</TE>
<TE>   Colborn said that the homeowner group will consider making a
formal presentation to the county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a wake-up call for a sleepy little community,"
said resident Phillip Lee, who shined a floodlight on a group of
young men hiding in a clump of bushes behind his beachfront home.</TE>
<TE>   He said on a typical Saturday night this summer, between 30 and 40
cars would line up to race on either side of Pacific Coast Highway.
He said that they hadn't caused any major problems.</TE>

<LD>Police issued 28 citations after the tranquillity of the Solimar
Beach Colony north of Ventura was shattered by drag racers, officials
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The street racers scaled fences and broke through an electronic
gate before dawn Sunday in a largely unsuccessful attempt to evade
pursuing sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers.</LD>
<LD>   Residents said the street races have become a weekly event along
the strip of Pacific Coast Highway behind the gated community.</LD>
<TE>   One of the cars involved in the races was impounded because of
multiple vehicle code violations, CHP Officer Dodd Stolworthy said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mexican supermarket chain Gigante USA, facing resistance from
Anaheim officials over plans to open its first Orange County grocery
store, will plead its case to the City Council tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Although the vote will deal solely with Gigante's application for
a liquor license, the case has attracted national media attention
because of allegations that Anaheim is discriminating against the
firm because it caters to Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   Council members must decide whether to overturn the Planning
Commission's vote rejecting Gigante's liquor license application. The
council also could allow Gigante to buy an existing license from an
establishment within three-quarters of a mile.</LD>

<HD>Fire Chars New San Jose Complex Before It Opens</HD>
<DH>Blaze: The posh development of shops and high-rent
apartments was expected to boost faltering economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fire on Monday raced through Santana Row, San Jose's new
$500-million housing and shopping center that was expected to help a
region reeling from the dot-com bust and sagging economy.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a major loss for this project to go down," said Fred
Phillips, a local retail consultant. "There are millions and millions
and millions of dollars going up in flames right now."</LD>
<LD>   The center, intended to draw shoppers and residents from
throughout Silicon Valley, had been scheduled to open Sept. 19.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1,500 construction workers had been rushing to put
finishing touches on the complex in time.</TE>
<TE>   Burning embers from the fire ignited a nearby apartment building,
rendering 39 apartments uninhabitable and leaving more than 100
people homeless, said Lisa Smyth of the San Jose Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   The fire erupted about 3 p.m., eventually consuming one of nine
buildings at the 42-acre complex.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Miles, general manager of the property, said he was in his
office in an adjacent building when he saw billowing smoke.</TE>
<TE>   He ran outside and saw the flames, and he and co-workers began
running around the site calling workers to safety.</TE>
<TE>   Battalion Chief Greg Stence called the blaze "the biggest I've
been through" in 27 years on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "At its peak, the whole place was in flames, corner to corner and
edge to edge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a huge column of black smoke, sections of the wall were
falling down. It was adrenaline-raising."</TE>
<TE>   Homes and businesses within half a mile of the site were
evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   As flames reached 100 feet, cinders blew onto nearby apartments,
where residents tried to douse them with garden hoses and packed
their possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Miles said it was too soon to know whether the destruction was
total or only partial.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty sure from the looks of it that the 246 residential
units are a complete loss," he said. "We hope we'll be able to
salvage a lot of what's on the parking deck. It's still smoldering
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters from San Jose and neighboring cities extinguished the
fire in about three hours.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blow," said San Jose Councilman Ken Yeager. "Everyone had
high expectations.... There's just a big sense of loss."</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials said it will be a few days before they know the
cause</TE>
<TE>   The project was designed to replicate the feel of a European
street scene and was billed as a vibrant new urban neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   It was to include 1,200 luxury residences, a hotel, a 36-store
shopping center with high-end retailers such as Escada and Gucci, a
farmers market, restaurants and cafes.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 people had been expected to move into apartments on
the north end of the property in October.</TE>
<TE>   Developers don't know yet if those apartments were damaged or will
be habitable in time. Studios in the development start at about $700.
A two-bedroom loft rents for about $3,200 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Taylor, 27, who lives about half a mile from the blaze, had
planned to rent one of the new two-bedroom apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just the ultimate place you would want to live," Taylor
said. "I would only have to walk down the stairs. It is a
self-contained community."</TE>

<LD>For the third time in a year, all but one of the California Highway
Patrol's 14 Cessna 206 airplanes have been grounded because of a
chronic engine malfunction.</LD>
<LD>   The planes, which were bought last year, were grounded Friday and
their engines sent to the manufacturer for repair of the crankshafts.
CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick said they should return to duty
within days.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, the engines of two planes abruptly died in flight.
Metal shavings were found in the crankshaft of a third. No one was
hurt in any of the incidents.</LD>

<HD>Pros and Cons of L.A. Breakup Are Spelled Out</HD>
<DH>Secession: Arguments for ballot pamphlet are expected to be
approved today. They could play a critical role in the fall election,
expert says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In arguments that will accompany the November ballot, opponents of
breaking up Los Angeles warn that the city faces a "financially risky
future" if the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood leave while
supporters contend smaller cities would be fiscally viable and more
responsive.</LD>
<LD>   The written arguments are expected to be approved today by the
county registrar-recorder to be included in the sample ballot
pamphlet for the Nov. 5 election, when voters will decide whether the
San Fernando Valley and Hollywood should become independent cities.</LD>
<LD>   The concise ballot arguments represent an important opportunity
for each side. Though the various campaigns have said they plan to
spend a combined $11 million or more on television and mail ads
between now and Nov. 5, political scientist Tom Hogen-Esch said many
voters may make up their minds based on the ballot arguments, which
were limited to 300 words each.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of voters tend to make up their minds at the last minute,
so this is pretty important literature," said Hogen-Esch, a professor
at Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   The cityhood measures must win a majority vote both in the
breakaway areas and in Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley cityhood argument is signed by Valley Independence
Committee Co-Chairs Richard Katz and Laurette Healey, as well as
county Supervisor Michael Antonovich, Valley VOTE board member Carlos
Ferreyra and Andrew Mardesich, a leader of the harbor area secession
drive that failed to make the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles residents would benefit from secession because they
would be better represented in smaller council districts, their
smaller city would have to operate more efficiently and City Hall
would no longer have to worry about Valley issues, the argument says.</TE>
<TE>   Payments to Los Angeles over 20 years to make the city financially
whole would be reduced gradually, so "$1.3 billion in Valley taxes
stays in the Valley to pay for local services ... ," the argument
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Power and water rates are protected. Taxes will not increase," it
says.</TE>
<TE>   Countering that argument is a statement signed by Mayor James K.
Hahn, former Mayor Richard Riordan, businessman and former Lakers
star Earvin "Magic" Johnson, county Supervisor Gloria Molina and
former Valley Congresswoman Bobbi Fielder.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is stronger when we are united and weaker when split
apart," it says.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of the 1994 Northridge earthquake would have been
"dramatically worse" for the Valley if the area had not been
supported by the resources of the entire city, it says.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding finances, the argument for Valley cityhood notes that in
studying secession, the Local Agency Formation Commission concluded
the new cities would be financially viable without causing fiscal
harm to the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But secession opponents disagree.</TE>
<TE>   According to the anti-secession argument, a Valley city would have
to pay "additional annual fees" for 20 years to make Los Angeles
financially whole.</TE>
<TE>   Further, an independent study found secession could cost the rest
of Los Angeles $3.9 billion over that period, "resulting in tax
increases and cuts to essential services," the argument says.</TE>
<TE>   The breakup is also "likely to result in higher water and electric
costs for everyone," it says.</TE>
<TE>   Like its Valley counterpart, the argument against Hollywood
cityhood warns of financial risks but adds that secession could
"destroy Hollywood's revival."</TE>
<TE>   It was signed by City Council members Tom LaBonge and Eric
Garcetti and honorary Hollywood Mayor Johnny Grant.</TE>
<TE>   The supporting argument promises a revitalized Hollywood, an end
to runaway film production and cleaner, safer streets.</TE>

<LD>Three men were killed in separate South Los Angeles shootings Sunday
night and early Monday, police said. No suspects were apprehended.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the dead men were identified as Carlos Florina, 22, and
Manuolevao Stibbie, 23, both of Los Angeles, said an LAPD spokesman,
Jack Richter. The third victim was not identified, pending
notification of his family.</LD>
<LD>   Florina died outside the Margarita Jones nightclub at 37th Place
and Flower Street, near the Los Angeles Coliseum. Police said someone
walked up to him at 2:20 a.m. Monday, accused him of being a gang
member and shot him. Police said Florina was not a gang member.</LD>
<TE>   The assailant left with the driver of a newer model silver or gray
Ford Expedition, according to witnesses, Richter said. The shooter
was described as a Latino, 21 to 27, about 5 feet, 6 inches tall and
weighing about 150 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Stibbie was shot about 8:40 p.m. Sunday while driving east on
223rd Street near Western Avenue in Harbor City. He was fired upon
from another car, police said. Richter said Stibbie lost control of
his vehicle, which overturned and hit several parked cars.</TE>
<TE>   A third fatal shooting took place at 12:10 a.m. Monday on 40th
Street between Vermont and Menlo avenues. Richter said the victim was
on foot.</TE>
<TE>   Less than an hour later, four men were wounded, one seriously, at
the El Culichi nightclub on Imperial Highway in La Mirada. Three
suspects were being sought, according to Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputies.</TE>

<HD>Simon Chides Davis Over Link to Metabolife</HD>
<DH>Politics: Though he too has accepted a donation from the
company, the Republican says a veto demonstrates 'pay-for-play'
approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. on Monday rebuked
Gov. Gray Davis for taking a six-figure donation from a major
marketer of herbal weight loss pills two years ago and then ceding
regulation of the product to the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   While criticizing Davis for taking contributions from the company,
Simon acknowledged that he too had accepted money from an officer of
San Diego-based Metabolife International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Simon said he had no plans to return the $10,000 donation, but
stressed that he was criticizing Davis for the governor's inaction
after receiving the money, not merely for accepting or keeping the
contributions. Vowing to "end pay-to-play once and for all" if he is
elected governor, Simon appeared outside the state Department of
Health Services building and declared: "Gray Davis, the buck stops at
your desk."</LD>
<TE>   Davis in 2000 accepted $150,000 in political donations from
Metabolife. The firm's flagship product, Metabolife 356, contains
herbal ephedrine, a stimulant that some health experts believe can
contribute to heart attacks, seizures and strokes.</TE>
<TE>   After taking the money, Davis declared in 2000, in a veto
statement on legislation related to the issue, that regulation of
herbal ephedrine was the responsibility of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of taking strong action and exhibiting any leadership at
all," Simon said, "Gray Davis passed the buck, as usual, and turned
the issue over to the federal government."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Davis promised to sign legislation regulating the
product if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration failed to act within
30 days.</TE>
<TE>   Davis made his statement after the U.S. Justice Department
announced it is investigating whether Metabolife's founder, Michael
Ellis, had lied in a letter to the FDA suggesting that the company
had received no consumer complaints about illnesses caused by its
product.</TE>
<TE>   The company had accumulated 13,000 complaints. Ellis' attorney has
said those complaints were not forwarded because company officials
had no evidence that their product had caused the health effects.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' campaign spokesman, Roger Salazar, said Davis had no plans
to return the donations, which include $100,000 in campaign donations
in 2000, $50,000 to a nonprofit corporation that Davis established to
host a party for delegates to the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles in 2000, and an additional $25,000 from Ellis last June.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said Simon's acceptance of $10,000 from a Metabolife
executive "underscores the hypocrisy of this guy."</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign aide called on Simon to bring up the issue of
regulation of herbal ephedrine when President Bush arrives in
California later this week to campaign for him.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had any guts, he'd call on the president to have his FDA do
its job," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   When he was governor of Texas, Bush's health department proposed
requiring that herbal ephedrine be sold only by prescription. That
was not approved; instead, another Texas regulation took effect last
year that requires that manufacturers place an 800 number on product
labels so consumers can call the FDA with any complaints of ill
effects.</TE>
<TE>   Simon defended his decision to accept the $10,000 from the
Metabolife executive and to not return it, saying: "They know I am
not for sale. Unlike Gray Davis, I can't be bought. The outrage here
is, once again, that Gray Davis let his fund-raising compromise his
responsibility to the state and to its citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he intends to spend much of the remaining 2 1/2 months
of the campaign criticizing Davis on those grounds. "</TE>

<HD>First Gold Line Rail Cars Arrive</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marking a major step forward, the builder of the railway connecting
Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles has received its first shipment of
light-rail cars.</LD>
<LD>   The two cars, each about 100 feet long and costing about $2.3
million, arrived recently at a stretch of track near South Pasadena.
They initially will be used to test track on the railway, expected to
open in July.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a huge milestone for this project," said Rick Thorpe, chief
executive of the group building the Gold Line.</LD>
<TE>   Thorpe said the South Pasadena segment will be finished and tested
first, probably by November. The $725-million railway is expected to
have 26 cars covering the 14-mile route in 30-minute trips.</TE>
<TE>   Construction is proceeding rapidly. Concrete columns now rise
nearly 25 feet over parts of Chinatown. Overhead power lines extend
along the Pasadena Freeway, and stations from Mount Washington to
Highland Park are almost finished.</TE>
<TE>   Construction was delayed early this year when local activists
asked the state to review their safety and environmental concerns. In
May, the Public Utilities Commission, the state agency in charge of
rail safety, rejected most of the activists' complaints in a vote
that allowed construction to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the activists are appealing that ruling. The PUC is
expected to consider the appeals in a closed meeting set for Thursday
in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Line will be run by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and will connect to the MTA's hub at Union Station,
allowing riders to transfer to the subway, Metrolink or countywide
buses and Amtrak.</TE>

<HD>Trump Buys Golf Course With Quite a Handicap</HD>
<DH>Sale: The 15-hole links in Rancho Palos Verdes lost the
18th green to the sea in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cliff-top golf course in Rancho Palos Verdes that shrank from 18
to 15 holes three years ago when part of it slid into the sea is
being sold to tycoon developer Donald Trump, a course employee said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Trump visited the Ocean Trails golf course Monday, called a staff
meeting at 2 p.m. and announced the purchase of the property, said
the employee, who asked not to be named.</LD>
<LD>   Trump could not be reached for comment Monday.</LD>
<TE>   His plans for the land with spectacular oceanfront views were not
known.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Zuckerman, a co-owner of the course with his brother until
Bankruptcy Court stripped them of the property in February, said he
met with Trump to discuss the property last year.</TE>
<TE>   Zuckerman said he was not surprised by the sale.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew [Trump] was interested in Ocean Trails because he told me,
so it's not a name totally out of the blue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken and Bob Zuckerman had tried to restore the full course after
the landslide, but eventually ran out of money. Credit Suisse First
Boston called in their loan, and Bankruptcy Court transferred
ownership to the bank.</TE>
<TE>   The bank hired Douglas Wilson Co. of San Diego to manage the
property.</TE>
<TE>   The firm could not be reached for comment Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   A chunk of land around Ocean Trails' 18th hole plunged into the
Pacific in June 1999, while the course was still under construction.
Two other holes--the 9th and 12th--were closed during subsequent
preparations to ready the course for play.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of the par-4 10th hole lies above what has been
described as a dormant landslide. Geologists said that area is
similar to the piece of land that fell into the sea. But city
officials and the owners said in May 2000 that all 15 holes were
stable and safe for play.</TE>
<TE>   The abridged, 15-hole course opened to the public in November
2000.</TE>

<HD>College District Trustees Meet on Chancellor</HD>
<DH>Education: Ventura County board will hear results of an
investigation of embattled chief Philip Westin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District are
scheduled to meet tonight behind closed doors to discuss the fate of
embattled Chancellor Philip Westin, but they are unlikely to take
action despite his demands for an immediate resolution.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the five-member board will receive an update from a Los
Angeles attorney hired to investigate Westin, who is under fire for
charging taxpayers $119,000 in expenses over a four-year period.
Trustees placed him on paid administrative leave five weeks ago,
which means he can continue to collect his $203,000-a-year salary by
staying home.</LD>
<LD>   In an apparent effort to force the board's hand, Westin sent a
letter last week to trustees and acting Chancellor Jim Walker,
demanding to be paid for the next 18 months while he looks for
another job and that he retain the title of chancellor. He also
demanded that the board issue a public statement saying he had done a
good job.</LD>
<TE>   "I think he's got a lawyer and I think it's his opening
negotiating stance to get as much money out of the taxpayers as he
can," said Larry Miller, president of the Ventura County Federation
of College Teachers. "His greed knows no end. He thinks he can get
another job, which is a real fantasy because he is the talk of the
state community college system."</TE>
<TE>   Westin declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Board members said they could not discuss Westin's future or the
contents of his letter because he has a right to privacy regarding
his employment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to put the district into future liability by saying
things that I shouldn't be saying," trustee Art Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a personnel matter and we need to take it up with the
board," trustee Allan Jacobs said. "Everyone has a right to privacy
regarding a personnel matter and that includes Dr. Westin."</TE>
<TE>   Board President Norman Nagel said trustees will hear a report
tonight from attorney Mary Dowell of the law firm Liebert Cassidy
Whitmore, who was hired last month to investigate the allegations
against Westin and to advise them on how to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   The trustees remain under pressure by taxpayers angered that the
board gave Westin a $30,000 raise last spring, two months after
demanding his resignation over allegations that he abused his expense
account. After Westin was cleared of criminal wrongdoing and
violating district policy, board members said they acted too hastily
in demanding his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   They said they agreed to boost Westin's salary to make the
chancellor's pay more competitive with other college districts. But
as the public's outrage grew, the board switched course and decided
to place Westin on administrative leave while it conducted an
investigation of his expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The district would have to pay Westin $305,000, or 18 months' pay,
if he is forced to resign, according to the terms of his contract. If
trustees can demonstrate he violated district policy or broke the
law, they could fire him "with cause," voiding his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Two trustees, Hernandez and John Tallman, are up for reelection in
November. Jacobs is facing a recall effort in his east county
district because of his support for Westin.</TE>
<TE>   The board meeting begins at 7 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Afghans Muster Unity for First Post-Taliban Independence
Day</HD>
<DH>Celebration: Karzai, his defense minister and the ex-king
appear before a stadium jammed with spectators, who include thousands
of women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A nation struggling for unity managed a convincing display of it
Monday at Independence Day observances, Afghans' first since the
Taliban was booted out of the country.</LD>
<LD>   Flanked by aged former monarch Mohammad Zaher Shah and
warlord-turned-Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim, President
Hamid Karzai told an estimated 30,000 people assembled at an outdoor
stadium that the nation's youth are the key to Afghanistan's
salvation.</LD>
<LD>   "You, Afghanistan's boys and girls, are our future hope. And never
forget that we owe our current independence to the martyrdom of a
million of your brothers and sisters," Karzai said, referring to the
Afghans who died in 23 years of war that ended with the Taliban's
defeat.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of youths assembled according to the sports they
participate in--including judo and boxing, bicycling and
weightlifting--paraded before Karzai, the ex-king and Cabinet
members. Also in attendance were thousands of women, whose presence
at such celebrations was forbidden by the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel happy and proud because this year we can participate in
this glorious day and we are no longer confined to the corners of our
rooms," said onlooker Sherzad Aqela, a schoolteacher.</TE>
<TE>   The sight of the three leaders sharing the reviewing stand was
meant to reassure the nation that its chiefs are united as it embarks
on a reconstruction effort expected to last at least 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's economy is shattered, and much of its
infrastructure--including roads and telephone service, electric power
and water service--has been obliterated. Afghanistan is one of the
poorest countries in the world, with a low life expectancy and a high
rate of infant mortality.</TE>
<TE>   The postwar period has also been marked by violent clashes among
various regional militias led by rival commanders or warlords.</TE>
<TE>   The former king returned to Afghanistan from Italy earlier this
year after 29 years of exile. In June, on the eve of a nationwide
tribal gathering known as a loya jirga, he announced that he did not
want any formal role in the new government, paving the way for Karzai
to become chief executive until elections planned for 2004. There was
widespread speculation at the time that Zaher Shah had acted under
U.S. pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim, the principal military leader of the victorious Northern
Alliance, called a news conference Saturday to rebut published
reports that he and Karzai were at odds. He insisted that he is a
team player eager to help lead Afghanistan toward stability and
security.</TE>
<TE>   After Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir was assassinated in July,
Karzai replaced his Afghan bodyguards with U.S. Special Forces
troops. The killing hasn't been solved.</TE>
<TE>   Politics seemed beside the point Monday as many Afghans relished
their national holiday. Despite the struggle ahead, many appeared
happy about the freedoms that have been restored to them.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel liberated from a very bad time of cruelty and
oppression. I saw some horrible things under the Taliban--women being
beaten in public for wearing dresses that showed their ankles, which
I will never forget," said government employee Ahmed Wali. "So this
is a day to feel proud. Freedom is beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Ali Shah Khan Mazlumyar, who represented Helmand province at
June's loya jirga, said: "Last year at this time, I was in exile and
there was a lot of fighting and bloodshed. Now, with God's grace, we
are living in peaceful conditions."</TE>

<HD>Brazil Works to Thwart Collapse</HD>
<DH>Latin America: President tries to win concessions from two
of his possible successors. But both fail to fully support IMF's
required belt-tightening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR and PAULA GOBBI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>Amid growing concern that a massive bailout by the International
Monetary Fund may not be enough to stave off financial panic and
collapse in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso held
emergency talks Monday aimed at winning concessions from the two
leftist politicians who lead the race to succeed him.</LD>
<LD>   The candidates, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party
and Ciro Gomes of the Labor Front, both made conciliatory statements
after the meetings. But both stopped short of offering full support
for the belt-tightening program the IMF has attached to its
$30-billion loan package.</LD>
<LD>   They have criticized IMF officials for imposing loan conditions,
including reductions in government spending and currency controls,
that they say hurt Brazilian workers and the poor.</LD>
<TE>   Political uncertainty and mounting debt have combined for weeks to
unhinge the Brazilian economy, Latin America's largest. The country
has been edging closer to the sort of financial meltdown experienced
last year by its neighbor Argentina, raising fears of a "contagion
effect" throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina defaulted on its debt earlier this year after protests
drove President Fernando de la Rua from office. Earlier this month,
the Bush administration agreed to a $1.5-billion emergency loan for
Uruguay in the wake of a financial crisis that sparked rioting in the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Other South American countries including Peru, Bolivia, Colombia,
Venezuela and Ecuador are suffering political or economic woes.
Ecuadorean Finance Minister Francisco Arosemena announced Monday that
his government had reached preliminary agreement with the IMF on
fiscal targets, a key step before receiving its own emergency loan.</TE>
<TE>   In Brazil, both the value of the currency and the government's
bond rating have dipped since the IMF agreed Aug. 7 to grant Brazil
the largest bailout in the fund's history.</TE>
<TE>   "We are conscious of the gravity of the situation, and are ready
to speak with all sectors of society in order to prevent the crisis
from bringing more suffering to the Brazilian people," Lula said in a
written statement after completing his meeting with Cardoso in
Brasilia, the nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Lula's comments helped bring a measure of calm to Brazil's
turbulent markets. The national currency, the real, gained about 2%
in value and closed at 3.10 to the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Lula holds a strong lead in nearly every poll ahead of the Oct. 7
election. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two candidates
will move to a runoff three weeks later. The ruling-party candidate,
Jose Serra, is the preferred candidate of the investment community,
but has been running a poor third.</TE>
<TE>   In reaching their agreement with the Brazilian government, IMF
officials asked that the leading presidential contenders in the race
sign off on the conditions attached to the loan.</TE>
<TE>   But the opposition candidates--Lula, Gomes and Anthony Garotinho,
who is running fourth in polls--are reluctant to do so, mindful of an
electorate that appears to be increasingly disenchanted with
Cardoso's pro-market reforms.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to criticizing the conditions on the IMF loans, Lula
and Gomes have said Brazil needs to increase spending for health and
education, and pull back from free-trade negotiations with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Lula also said after meeting with Cardoso that if elected
president he would break with the current government's policies "from
the first day I am in office."</TE>
<TE>   While reminding his audience that his party had agreed to abide by
all of Brazil's international commitments--including those with the
IMF--Lula also said he would remain true to his principles and would
not adopt policies that hurt Brazilian workers.</TE>
<TE>   Lula is a lifelong trade unionist who cut his political teeth as a
labor organizer in the factories of Sao Paulo.</TE>
<TE>   Gomes emerged from his own meeting with Cardoso to say he had
asked the president for a draft of the IMF agreement and that as soon
as he received one he would render his opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a jab at the government, he said Cardoso's "economic model"
was to blame for the crisis, as are "international [investors]
unwilling to understand the potential of the Brazilian economy."
Garotinho took an even tougher stance, saying Cardoso was trying to
"impose the straitjacket of a monetary policy monitored by the IMF."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such criticism, Cardoso was ready to declare victory
Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "The only one who has to give explicit support to the [IMF]
agreement is me," the president said. "The question is whether the
candidates will honor it if elected. All of them told me they will."</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of economists and observers--including financier
George Soros--have also criticized the IMF package, saying it dooms
the incoming government, whoever leads it.</TE>
<TE>   "The agreement is a life vest for President Cardoso but an anchor
around the neck for the next president," said former Economy Minister
Delfim Netto.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the agreement makes the aid conditional on
Brazil maintaining a budget surplus of 3.75% before taking into
account the interest it pays on its debt. But running such a surplus
will mean the government will probably have to sharply reduce
spending or raise taxes--either of which could bring recession.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that this package failed to bring relief [to Brazil]
indicates that something is fundamentally wrong with the
international financial system," Soros wrote recently.</TE>
<TE>   Similar concerns have been expressed by some of the business
leaders who form the core of support for Cardoso and Serra.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Bernardini, vice president of Sao Paulo's Industrialists
Federation, expressed skepticism that the IMF deal can pull Brazil
out of its deepening budgetary hole.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's public debt stands at about $250 billion. That number
grows as the value of the real drops and as market jitters drive up
interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   "We have only bought time," Bernardini said. "Maybe six to eight
months."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Moody's Investors Service, the rating agency,
downgraded the country's foreign-currency bonds five levels below
investment grade.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter which candidate wins this fall's presidential election,
the new administration will face growing fiscal pressures," Moody's
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lula leads in every poll here, pulling as far as 24 percentage
points ahead of the ruling party's Serra. And his campaign shows few
signs of losing momentum.</TE>
<TE>   The Sao Paulo Industrialists Federation has quietly announced it
will back Lula in the runoff election if, as expected, Serra is
eliminated in the first round of voting.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula has the profile of a negotiator, he grew up where
negotiating was the way you solved problems," Bernardini said. "We
need a national consensus, and Lula has more possibility of making
that happen."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Serra's grim demeanor and failure to make headway in
the polls has led to a near rebellion in the ruling coalition.
Members of the government- allied Brazilian Democratic Movement Party
reportedly gave him an ultimatum recently: If his standing in the
polls doesn't improve by Sept. 1, they will abandon him.</TE>
<TE>   Failure by Serra to revive his campaign would probably give
Brazilians the choice of two left-leaning candidates in the runoff:
Lula, who is known for his fiery speeches attacking the nation's
oligarchy and the vagaries of the capitalist system; and Gomes, who
despite having once been Brazil's economy minister has cultivated a
reputation as an unpredictable and mercurial leader.</TE>
<TE>   Gomes only enhanced that image with his remarks at a dinner with
financial leaders last week. Asked what he might do to calm Brazil's
roiled markets, Gomes exploded. "I would cut off my own hand to avoid
signing Brazil away to the bankers!" he shouted.</TE>

<LD>Iraq's National Assembly has unanimously backed the nomination of
Saddam Hussein, president since 1979, to run unopposed for another
seven-year term in voting scheduled for October.</LD>
<LD>   "The historic leadership of President Saddam Hussein will remain a
thorn in the eyes of our enemies ... and this march will continue
until it is consolidated by victory, end of sanctions and driving
back the aggression," the assembly said.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. has been pushing for a "regime change" in Iraq, which has
been under U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in 1990.</LD>

<LD>Thousands of people have been battling massive forest fires sweeping
across Mongolia and shrouding the capital, Ulan Bator, in thick
smoke, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   About 110 fires were raging in eight provinces, and 64 were out of
control, civil defense officials said. The blazes are thought to have
been started by vacationers visiting the countryside parched by a
hot, dry summer.</LD>
<LD>   "The situation is catastrophic," civil defense spokesman
Luvsanjamba said. The fires are the latest blow to a country reeling
from two years of drought followed by harsh winters that killed huge
numbers of livestock from 1999 to 2001.</LD>

<DH>Disaster: Huge army chopper full of soldiers goes down in
Chechnya. Rebels say they shot it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A mammoth Russian helicopter crashed into a minefield in strife-torn
Chechnya on Monday, reportedly killing about 85 soldiers and giving
this country a brutal reminder of the costs of a war that has been
slipping from public view. Chechen rebels claimed they shot down the
helicopter.</LD>
<LD>   Reports from witnesses and Russian defense officials suggested
that the MI-26 helicopter--dubbed the korova, or "cow," by the
military because of its size and shape--might have been hit by an
antiaircraft rocket. However, there was no official confirmation, and
both the number of casualties and the cause of the crash were
unclear. The Interfax news agency said this morning that as many as
100 soldiers may have been killed.</LD>
<LD>   The Itar-Tass news agency reported that witnesses spotted a
missile trail before the helicopter crashed. The State Civil Aviation
Service and prosecutors investigating the crash said the cause was a
missile or a fire. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin named a top
military commission to carry out an urgent investigation.</LD>
<TE>   The chopper, jammed with soldiers, was approaching Russian
military headquarters at Khankala, near the Chechen capital, Grozny,
after flying from the Mozdok base northwest of the breakaway region
when it went down.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot reported a fire in one engine, requested permission for
an emergency landing and managed to avoid houses. However, the
helicopter crash-landed in a minefield just 300 yards from the
runway, complicating the rescue efforts. Sappers had to go in to
clear mines before rescue workers could reach the crash site.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials initially said there were 117 people on the
helicopter, which can carry more than 100 troops plus armored
vehicles. The estimate of the number on board then crept up to 142,
including three civilians. Military sources reported that 80 to 85
people had died and that 32 had survived. That left the possibility
that the death toll could rise.</TE>
<TE>   A report on state-owned ORT television suggested that there were
more survivors initially but that some men were killed by mines as
they struggled to escape the wreckage. The mines were planted by the
Russian military to protect the base from the Chechen rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the crash, a Web site used by the rebels claimed
it was the result of a carefully planned attack.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the mobile groups, part of a special antiaircraft unit of
the Chechen forces, which was following the routes of transportation
of units of occupiers, succeeded in destroying an enemy helicopter,
causing significant loss of life among the enemy," said an urgent
announcement on the site. The rebels have claimed success at shooting
down planes and helicopters in Chechnya in the past, but some of
their claimed hits, denied by Russians, may have been simple air
crashes.</TE>
<TE>   If the rebel claim proves true, the death toll could surpass the
most deadly attack on Russians in the current conflict. In February
2000, 84 Russian paratroopers were killed in a battle with rebels.
Most of them were from the northwestern Russian city of Pskov.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the loss of life will once again focus Russian
attention on a conflict that has faded from public consciousness but
still claims hundreds of lives a year.</TE>
<TE>   Chechen separatist fighters are outgunned by Russian forces but
have never been defeated. Waging a guerrilla war, they exact a steady
toll of Russian casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the crash, smoke still rose above the high grass in
the field where the helicopter was burning. Reporters were not
allowed within 300 yards of the site.</TE>
<TE>   Russian forces entered the breakaway region in the Caucasus in
1994, suffered heavy casualties and withdrew defeated in 1996. When
Putin became prime minister in 1999, he gained popularity with a
gruff pledge to exterminate the rebels. His effort to regain control
of Chechnya became the centerpiece of his successful presidential
campaign in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   By early 2000, Russia controlled most of Chechnya, but rebel
commanders continued to mount tough guerrilla operations. Russia's
response has been to round up Chechen men, hundreds of whom have
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   At a distance, the MI-26 appears similar to any other helicopter.
However, as it approaches, its size becomes apparent. It looms about
26 feet high and 110 feet long. Soldiers can enter the cavernous
interior via a large rear hatch, which gapes open to admit tanks,
military trucks and jeeps.</TE>
<TE>   There have been at least seven helicopter crashes in Chechnya
since the second war began in 1999, some as a result of rebel
missiles. Last September, two Russian generals and 11 soldiers died
when Chechens shot down their copter.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander I. Zhilin, defense analyst at the Moscow News weekly,
said continuing rebel acts in Chechnya expose the Russians' weakness
in military intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict "will continue indefinitely if the Kremlin doesn't
change its tactics in Chechnya and if it doesn't make it a priority
to carefully and painstakingly build up a network of special services
agents in Chechnya which could gather information in time to prevent
acts of terror," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Zhilin added that the Russians have no choice but to remain in
Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most difficult time of the war now, but there is no
way back," he said. "It is clear that whatever the setbacks, the
Kremlin just can't withdraw its military forces from Chechnya. This
will very quickly plunge all of Chechnya into banditry and
lawlessness."</TE>

<LD>Elbe River flood waters overwhelmed a dike and swamped part of this
eastern German city Monday, forcing more evacuations as Europe
wrestled with the aftermath of violent storms.</LD>
<LD>   German authorities reported three more deaths Monday, increasing
the Europe-wide toll to 109. European leaders also grappled with how
to pay for damage put at as much as $20 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Germany rescinded a planned $6.8-billion tax cut, and the Czech
Republic's Defense Ministry said it would scrap a $2-billion plan to
buy 24 fighter jets.</LD>
<TE>   In the Czech capital, Prague, officials were inspecting buildings
for flood damage after three collapsed in recent days. But they hoped
to reopen the 14th century Charles Bridge today.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of German soldiers and emergency workers shored up flood
barriers as the Elbe rolled northward after forcing 80,000 people
from their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Military helicopters ferried sandbags to a dike being built to
protect a key highway linking Berlin and Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Floods have wiped out or severely damaged scores of roads, rail
lines, bridges, stores and private homes in Germany, Austria, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   In Prague, authorities examined structures damaged by flooding
from the Vltava River. Pumps were installed to drain water from a
cemetery where 10,000 Holocaust victims are buried at the site of a
former Nazi concentration camp, Theresienstadt.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers in Germany, meanwhile, captured a sea lion that
escaped from the Prague Zoo during the flooding and swam 150 miles,
zoo spokesman Vit Kahle said. Gaston, a 12-year-old male, is to be
returned home today.</TE>

<HD>11 Charged as Immigrant-Smugglers</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Prosecutors say indictees were part of a ring that
left 14 men to die in Arizona last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexican prosecutors brought immigrant-smuggling charges Monday
against 11 people who allegedly worked for a ring that left 14
Mexican men to die in the Arizona desert last year.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest of the alleged smugglers over the weekend, together
with U.S. convictions against three other smugglers, has reportedly
dealt a severe blow to the ring.</LD>
<LD>   However, Mexico's Justice Department said in a statement that the
suspected top leaders of the ring had fled a raid in the Mexican
border city of Nogales. The fugitives apparently include Ebodio
Manilla Cabrera, a Mexican who has been indicted in the case in the
United States.</LD>
<TE>   Organized crime and human-trafficking charges were brought against
four women and seven men, described by prosecutors as principal
members of the ring. The raid also netted a number of Central
American migrants.</TE>
<TE>   Smugglers abandoned 25 Mexican migrants in late May 2001 in the
Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge near Yuma, Ariz. The bleak
terrain where they were left is known as the Devil's Path.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen died and 11 others survived in one of the deadliest such
attempts in Arizona history.</TE>

<HD>Bethlehem Is Skeptical Over Pullout News</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Relieved residents are able to move freely under
deal with Israel. But many expect the army and the curfews to return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Residents of this biblical city reacted with measured relief Monday
to news of the Israeli military's withdrawal under a deal between
Israeli and Palestinian officials.</LD>
<LD>   "The Israel Defense Forces have pulled out of Bethlehem and
redeployed around the city," the army said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, shopkeepers dusted off their merchandise. Vegetable
markets reopened, and traffic jams returned to commercial areas.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very happy," said Raida Hroub, a 28-year-old mother standing
beside plum, date and peach hawkers, her four children in tow. "We've
had it up to here," she added, lifting her hand to her chin.</TE>
<TE>   After so much turmoil, however, many Palestinians refused to
believe that the curfews, incursions, arrests and military searches
that have been so much a part of their lives in recent months were
over.</TE>
<TE>   "They know the road back here very well," Ruba Magdi, 22, said of
the Israeli army. "There have been many withdrawals, but they keep
coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Under a deal reached between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
late Sunday, Israel agreed to pull out of Bethlehem and parts of the
Gaza Strip within 48 hours. In return, the Palestinian Authority said
it would endeavor to prevent attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said the relaxation could be extended to other West Bank
cities if all goes well, although militant Palestinian groups have
already denounced the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Our rifles will remain directed against the Zionist enemy," said
Abdulaziz Rantisi, a senior official of Hamas, which has been behind
many suicide attacks that have killed scores of Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing the Moment</TE>
<TE>   Even if the cease-fire turns out to be temporary, Bethlehem
residents were quick to grab the opportunity to shop, see friends and
enjoy a bit of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll enjoy it while it lasts," said Isaac Hazboun, a 60-year-old
commercial photographer. "It makes us feel like human beings again."</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest problems ahead will be resuscitating an economy
crippled by travel restrictions and conflict. Palestinian Labor
Minister Ghassan Khatib recently reported that unemployment in the
Palestinian areas is 80%, twice what it was five months ago. Only
about a third of Bethlehem's shops were open Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't sold a single thing yesterday or today," said Khalid
Fauzi, a tangle of souvenir necklaces draped over his arm as he
trolled Manger Square for nonexistent tourists. "Before the intifada,
I'd pull down $100 on a good day. Now I have to borrow from relatives
just to make ends meet."</TE>
<TE>   Living under four months of intermittent curfew has also taken its
toll in less obvious ways. Many complained of gaining weight after
being forced to stay in their homes with little to do but eat and
watch television.</TE>
<TE>   "I competed with my kids for the video game machine," said Elias
Hazboun, owner of a small liquor and snack store on Star Street
opposite the Church of the Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   Extended periods together in close quarters put emotional strain
on many families. Omar Habib, a 17-year-old dubbed the "Church Guy"
by his friends after spending 23 days in the Church of the Nativity
during the April-May siege, said spending so much time at home made
him claustrophobic.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've been in jail," he said. "My mother, father,
older brother, they all tell me what to do all the time: 'Go get
this,' 'Go do that.' We've had a lot of arguments."</TE>
<TE>   Life as Improvisation</TE>
<TE>   But the restrictions also have forced people to become more
flexible. Wedding ceremonies and receptions typically held in the
afternoon and evening were shifted to mornings and lunchtimes, when
curfews were more likely to be suspended. Local television stations
would then broadcast wedding and funeral "rain dates" in the event
that curfews were reimposed at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser, a Palestinian policeman who gave only his first name,
expressed confidence that he and his colleagues would be able to
maintain security, provided that the Israelis withdrew and gave them
enough room to do their job.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe step by step we can extend the freedoms to other West
Bank cities," he said. "Both sides are tired of the fighting."</TE>
<TE>   But others were more skeptical. Khader abu Abbara, a local
official with the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, predicted that the hastily arranged deal would fall apart.
He said Israel is demanding that the weakened Palestinian Authority
do what the strong Israeli army could not--end suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   "Palestinians are tired and think we should go for a peace plan,"
he said. "But the way it stands now, one operation by a Palestinian
militia will end the whole thing. The only solution is a political
deal with the promise of statehood."</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Nablus on Monday, several Palestinians
reportedly were injured after shooting broke out between Palestinians
and Israeli soldiers. The army also said it destroyed a bomb lab.</TE>
<TE>   A 14-year-old Palestinian boy reportedly was shot and killed near
Jenin in the West Bank. The Israeli army said it was investigating.
Other reports said four Palestinian policemen and two members of the
militant Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade were arrested at a police station in
Ramallah in the West Bank.</TE>

<HD>Terrorist's Alleged Death as Mysterious as His Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>If terror mastermind Abu Nidal is indeed dead, how did he die?</LD>
<LD>   The aging Palestinian, one of the Middle East's most notorious
killers of Jews, Israelis, Westerners and other Arabs, reportedly was
found dead in a Baghdad apartment over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Some said it was suicide. But reports said he had multiple bullet
wounds. He had been ill. He was hated by many.</LD>
<TE>   The purported demise of Abu Nidal was announced in a two-paragraph
item at the top of the front page of Monday's Al Ayyam newspaper,
published in the West Bank and circulated in Jerusalem. Al Ayyam is
edited by a close confidant of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat, one of countless enemies who would like to see Abu Nidal
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Senior officials of Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization,
especially those who advocated negotiating with Israel, were among
Abu Nidal's many victims through the years.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials confirmed Abu Nidal's death to reporters at
Arafat's headquarters. But the terrorist's family, including a
brother in the West Bank city of Nablus, expressed doubts. And a
deputy in Damascus, Syria, denied the report.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Nidal, which means "father of the struggle," is the nom de
guerre of Sabri Banna, born 65 years ago in Jaffa in what was then
British-ruled Palestine. His well-to-do family fled to the West Bank
after Israel declared independence in 1948, and then to Saudi Arabia
after the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel captured the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Once regarded by the U.S. government as the most dangerous
terrorist group in existence, Abu Nidal's organization had been much
less active in recent years. His death, if confirmed, was not
expected to change today's violence in the Middle East or the state
of international terrorism, experts here said. But it would represent
a symbolic closing of one of the bloodiest chapters in the history of
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "The world would certainly be a better place without people like
Abu Nidal," State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Nidal was essentially the Osama bin Laden of his day, a
ruthless killer whose name became synonymous with terrorism. A master
of disguises and illicit finance, he was a mysterious figure whose
whereabouts and activities had always been the stuff of rumors.</TE>
<TE>   He broke with Arafat's PLO in 1974 because it wasn't radical
enough for him. Initially, he was based in Iraq and worked with
intelligence officials in attacking Iraq's Syrian rivals. At the same
time, he was building his own Revolutionary Council of Fatah.</TE>
<TE>   Never one to let loyalty get in the way, Abu Nidal switched sides
in 1983 and worked under Syrian auspices to strike out at Arab states
attempting rapprochement with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Nidal commandos attacked synagogues in Europe, hijacked or
bombed international airliners, shot up restaurants and hotels, and
assassinated diplomats the world over. Hundreds of people were killed
or wounded in attacks in 20 countries throughout the 1970s and '80s
and into the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after Christmas in 1985, in his most infamous assault,
Abu Nidal deployed suicide squads armed with machine guns and
grenades to the airports of Rome and Vienna. Simultaneously, they
strafed the ticket counters of Israel's El Al airlines, killing 20
people, including five Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Abu Nidal was the 'ultimate terrorist': cruel, uninhibited,
efficient and devoid of ideology," Yossi Melman, a commentator for
the Israeli Haaretz newspaper and author of a book on Abu Nidal, said
Monday. "In the 1970s and 1980s, he was considered something of a Bin
Laden, a man of terror who had his hand in everything."</TE>
<TE>   Melman described Abu Nidal as a "terror contractor" who served
many masters. He worked for the Iraqis against Syria, the Syrians
against Jordan, and the Libyans against a variety of opponents,
Melman said. In return for his services, he received money,
intelligence, logistical assistance and cover.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is believed that he never attacked inside Israel, Abu
Nidal was responsible for the 1982 attempted assassination of an
Israeli ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov. That incident provided
Israel's defense minister at the time, current Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, with a pretext for invading Lebanon to oust Arafat's PLO from
Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Abu Nidal killed key officials in the PLO,
including several of Arafat's closest associates.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians sentenced him to death in absentia for what was
reported to have been an attempt to assassinate Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they believe that Abu Nidal moved to Iraq in
1999, given sanctuary by President Saddam Hussein after being booted
from Egypt and Libya.</TE>
<TE>   He had been rumored to have cancer or leukemia. Azzam Ahmad, the
former Palestinian ambassador to Iraq, said in an interview that Abu
Nidal had undergone at least two major heart surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation was abundant about how and why Abu Nidal died. Several
Palestinian reports, including the Al Ayyam story, suggested that he
had committed suicide--but it didn't explain how he could have shot
himself more than once. The reports suggested that he had been
despondent over his illness.</TE>
<TE>   Other theories suggested that he was killed by a Palestinian rival
settling old scores, or by his Iraqi hosts. Hussein is said to be
trying to stave off an American attack and might have decided that
Abu Nidal was too much of a liability.</TE>
<TE>   "Since most security apparatuses in the world haunt the man, any
information about him or his followers brings about waves of rumors
and guesses as to his whereabouts," Reuven Paz, an Israeli expert in
counter-terrorism, wrote after the rare arrest two years ago of a
member of the Abu Nidal group.</TE>
<TE>   Halima Nimer was apprehended by Austrian police as she tried to
withdraw the equivalent of $7.5 million from a bank in Vienna.</TE>

<HD>Woman's Stoning Sentence Is Upheld</HD>
<DH>Nigeria: Lawyers for Amina Lawal plan to appeal the Islamic
court's decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>FUNTUA, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>An Islamic court in northern Nigeria ruled Monday that a young mother
must face death by stoning according to Muslim law for having sex
outside marriage.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling upheld a decision by a lower court. The woman's lawyers
said they planned to file an appeal to a higher Islamic court. If
that fails, they can appeal to the Supreme Court, where the case
would force a showdown between Nigeria's constitutional and religious
authorities.</LD>
<LD>   The introduction of Islamic law in a dozen northern states has
sparked sectarian clashes. President Olusegun Obasanjo's government
has declared Islamic punishments such as beheadings, amputations and
stonings unconstitutional.</LD>
<TE>   Clutching her 8-month-old daughter, Amina Lawal burst into tears
as the judge delivered the ruling. Lawal, 30, was first sentenced in
March after giving birth more than nine months after divorcing.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those in the packed courtroom shouted, "God is great!" in
Hausa, as Lawal wept.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders and human rights groups were dismayed.</TE>
<TE>   "The application of [Islamic law] is unconstitutional, and we must
not tolerate it further," John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan, archbishop of
Abuja, the capital, told the Italian-based missionary news service
MISNA.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the sentence would be implemented as soon as Lawal
finishes breast-feeding her baby.</TE>

<HD>Peru Reportedly Will Free Pilots Who Downed Cessna</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru</DL>
<LD>A Peruvian court has ordered the release of two air force pilots who
were jailed after they mistakenly shot down a small plane last year,
killing an American missionary and her infant, their lawyer said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Jorge Power said his clients' right to be charged within
nine months of incarceration had been violated. They had been in jail
more than 10 months.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Jose Antonio Redhead and Lt. Richard Hercilla should be
released this week, Power said. He said the court made its decision
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The release order followed a successful appeal to the
Constitutional Tribunal, Peru's highest court for constitutional
matters, Power said.</TE>
<TE>   Redhead and Hercilla piloted a fighter jet that shot down a Cessna
seaplane, killing American missionary Veronica Bowers, 35, and her
7-month-old daughter, Charity, in a botched drug interdiction mission
in April 2001. The pilot and Bowers' husband and son survived.</TE>
<TE>   The Peruvian plane downed the Cessna after a CIA-operated
surveillance flight identified it as a possible drug courier.</TE>
<TE>   Power said the pilots may still face trial on charges including
disobedience and negligence, but he did not know when those cases
would go to court.</TE>

<HD>Pope Bids Farewell to His Native Poland</HD>
<DH>Europe: 'It's so sad to leave,' says the ailing pontiff,
who referred to his mortality more than once during his pilgrimage
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KRAKOW, Poland</DL>
<LD>Concluding a nostalgic journey home, Pope John Paul II prayed Monday
at a mountain monastery for the strength to carry on with his work,
then bid his nation an emotional farewell.</LD>
<LD>   "At the end, I must say, it's so sad to leave," John Paul, 82,
said in his final words at Krakow's John Paul II Airport before
flying back to Rome.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd responded with chants of "Stay with us" and "Come back."</LD>
<TE>   The stooped and ailing pontiff, who suffers the trembling hands
and sometimes slurred speech of Parkinson's disease, expressed hope
that he will indeed visit again. "Many have wished to meet me,
although not all were able to do so," he said in a departure speech.
"Maybe next time....</TE>
<TE>   "In my spirit, I embrace the whole of my beloved homeland," he
said, before climbing the stairs of his airplane on his own strength,
an aide at one arm.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, while celebrating Mass at a mountain sanctuary that he
often visited as a boy, John Paul prayed to the Virgin Mary for his
nation and himself:</TE>
<TE>   "Open the hearts of the prosperous to the needs of the poor and
the suffering. Enable the unemployed to find an employer. Help those
who are poverty-stricken to find a home.... Obtain also for me
strength in body and spirit, that I may carry out to the end the
mission given me."</TE>
<TE>   The pontiff's failing health has prompted speculation that he
might resign, but he has repeatedly expressed his desire and
intention to carry on.</TE>
<TE>   The Kalwaria Zebrzydowska monastery was one of many stops in this
pilgrimage that brought the pontiff to places dear to him from his
youth and early career. Monks said that during one childhood visit
there by the future pope after the death of his mother, his father
pointed to a painting of the Virgin Mary and told the boy: "This is
your mother now."</TE>
<TE>   During his visit Monday, John Paul repeated a request he made
Sunday at a Krakow church, asking his listeners to pray for him "when
I am alive and after I die."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul spoke repeatedly during his trip of the impact on
ordinary people of Poland's difficult transition from communism to a
market economy. Unemployment is at 18%, and economic growth is
running at only about 1% after a period of much better performance in
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very difficult period in Poland now, but you can see there
are more and more people gathering around the pope," said Ludmila
Gzowski, 50, an engineer who attended the morning Mass. "I think
people are searching for guidance, for something normal in their
lives, some security."</TE>
<TE>   With the fall of communism a decade ago, Poles "are a people who
are kind of thrown into deep water," added her husband, Tadeusz, 50.
"We have a lot of possibilities. But somehow we don't always know how
to choose the right road. The pope is a guiding light. From his
words, we can know how to act."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest event of this pilgrimage, which began Friday, was an
open-air Sunday Mass that John Paul conducted for more than 2 million
people, the largest crowd ever assembled in Poland to hear him.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the pontiff also flew by helicopter over his hometown
of Wadowice, circling three times over the main square and a crowd
estimated at 12,000, with many people waving white-and-yellow Vatican
flags. The papal helicopter also flew above the Tatra Mountains,
where he loved to hike and ski in his younger days. People in the
mountains lighted bonfires Monday to greet him.</TE>
<TE>   In his departure speech, John Paul expressed the hope that Poland
will not simply become more like Western Europe but will transmit
spiritual values to its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "I do hope that by cherishing those values, the Polish nation ...
will find its due place in the structures of the European Union and
not only will not lose its own identity but will enrich this
continent and the whole world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That comment could be seen as a political gift to the Polish
government, which is seeking more active Vatican support for the
country's EU membership bid. Although a clear majority of Poles favor
EU entry, backers of the effort fear an erosion of public support due
to frustration over some of the likely terms, including rights of
foreigners to buy land, temporary limits on the free movement of
labor and lower-than-hoped-for farm subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   After becoming pope in 1978, John Paul played a key role in
undermining communism here, largely by inspiring Poles to seek
change. But he has not hesitated to criticize shortcomings in the
country's new democratic and capitalist system.</TE>
<TE>   In bidding John Paul farewell, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Polish
primate, noted that it is often said Poles "will hear and applaud but
not listen to the pope." Such comments refer to practices such as
widespread consumerism and corruption in a country that is nominally
90% Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   But John Paul "has made an immeasurable contribution to this
nation," Glemp said.</TE>
<TE>   He then told the story of how once, while teaching a religious
class, he noticed a boy who "was not paying attention."</TE>
<TE>   "However, when asked, he was able to tell me precisely what I was
talking about," Glemp continued. "It seems to me that we resemble
this boy a little. He was listening in another way. We, too, more
often than not, leaf through albums about the Holy Father rather than
read texts by him. This may be true, but we know what the Holy Father
means."</TE>

<HD>Singapore Politician Loser in Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Asia: Opposition leader is convicted of defaming the
city-state's premier and senior minister.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE</DL>
<LD>An opposition politician lost a defamation suit Monday brought by
Singapore's top leaders, in a ruling that could lead to costly
damages and make him ineligible to run in national elections.</LD>
<LD>   A judge ruled that Singapore Democratic Party leader Chee Soon
Juan defamed Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong with comments he made while campaigning last year, court
documents showed.</LD>
<LD>   "People will see it doesn't really pay to speak up in Singapore,"
Chee told reporters after the closed-door hearing. He said he was
already nearly bankrupt and probably wouldn't be able to pay. The
exact amount of damages was not announced.</LD>
<TE>   Bankrupt citizens may not run for Parliament, and critics charge
that the government has employed defamation suits and their
accompanying penalties to drive the opposition out of politics.</TE>
<TE>   All but two elected seats in the legislature are held by Lee and
Goh's People's Action Party.</TE>
<TE>   Chee, while running unsuccessfully for a seat in Parliament last
year, questioned the fate of a $10-billion loan made in 1998 to
neighboring Indonesia, then ruled by strongman Suharto.</TE>
<TE>   Chee is already banned from Parliament for five years following an
earlier legal dispute about comments on religion he made at
Singapore's Speakers Corner.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Envoy Hopeful That Deal Can Be Made to End Sudan War</HD>
<DH>Africa: Ex-Sen. Danforth predicts a pact between nation's
Islamic regime and rebels in the south. But he adds: 'Peace is not
paper. Peace is work.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>President Bush's special envoy to Sudan expressed optimism Monday
that an agreement could be reached to end a nearly 20-year-old civil
war in the African country that has killed an estimated 2 million
people and caused millions more to flee their homes.</LD>
<LD>   After he met with leaders of the Sudanese government and the main
rebel group who are negotiating here, former Sen. John C. Danforth
predicted that a written peace deal would be reached by year's end.</LD>
<LD>   But he warned that any such agreement would be merely a first
step, adding that both parties and the international community would
have to work hard to implement it.</LD>
<TE>   "I've always believed that paper litters the landscape with
respect to peace agreements and that a piece of paper is only a piece
of paper," Danforth said. "Peace is not paper. Peace is work."</TE>
<TE>   Since Bush appointed him five days before the Sept. 11 attacks,
the former Missouri senator has been skeptical that a meaningful
peace deal could be forged to end one of Africa's longest-running and
most brutal conflicts. Even early last month, Danforth said he did
not foresee a peace deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I optimistic? No," he said in an interview with the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch. "I think optimism requires some tangible basis, that
you're confident that this will work. I don't know if it will or
not."</TE>
<TE>   But later last month, in talks sponsored by the Kenyan government,
both sides surprised analysts by announcing that they had settled
their differences on two of the most contentious issues. The
government agreed that its Islamic Sharia law would not be enforced
in southern Sudan, and both sides agreed that six years after a final
peace deal, people in southern Sudan would vote whether to remain in
Sudan or secede.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict pits the Muslim-dominated government in the north
against rebels seeking more autonomy in the south for Christians and
those practicing traditional African religions. In the United States,
a coalition of African American leaders and conservative Christians
has been pressuring the Bush administration to take action against
the government, which they say oppresses Christians and encourages
slave raids on southern Sudanese civilians.</TE>
<TE>   At the second round of talks, now taking place in Machakos, about
30 miles southeast of Nairobi, the capital, the government and rebels
from the Sudan People's Liberation Army are discussing how to divide
power in the national government and how to share money flowing from
oil fields in the south.</TE>
<TE>   While talks continued Monday, Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed
Bashir reshuffled his Cabinet to include seven members of a breakaway
faction of a leading opposition party.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have said that since seizing power in 1989, Bashir and
leaders of his radical Islamist government have been eager to broaden
their base.</TE>
<TE>   Agreeing to an interim deal is a key way to win support from a
large segment of the population, the analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to be seen as the party that delivers the peace and
delivers the oil," said John Prendergast, a Sudan specialist with the
International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Prendergast, who was a member of the U.S. National Security
Council during the Clinton administration, reported that despite the
peace talks, the Sudanese government has intensified efforts to clear
civilians from an area around prospective oil fields.</TE>
<TE>   Prendergast visited Sudan earlier this month and interviewed many
people among tens of thousands of civilians who were forced to flee
the government's new offensive in western Upper Nile province.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Prendergast said that the current peace talks represent the
"best chance" for peace since Bashir's coup.</TE>
<TE>   But he said that the United States needs to do more to nudge the
parties toward a final deal. Bush, he said, should personally involve
himself in the process, making telephone calls to participants in the
talks--as he does in the Middle East peace process.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Danforth described Bush as "fully engaged" in Sudan,
saying the president has met with him repeatedly to discuss the
issue. Danforth said the president wants to use any successful peace
deal in Sudan as a model to solve other conflicts. Bush believes that
"if Sudan can work out a peace deal, it could be possible for
anywhere in the world," Danforth said.</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Two U.S. Special Forces soldiers were shot and wounded on an
intelligence-gathering mission in central Afghanistan, the U.S.
military said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   One soldier was shot in the calf and the other in the upper thigh
in the attack early Sunday in Oruzgan province, Col. Roger King said
at Bagram air base, the U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Four men were detained for questioning. The soldiers, whose names
were not released, were being treated at Bagram until their
conditions stabilized. A spokeswoman said they would be flown to
Germany late Monday.</LD>
<TE>   A U.S. air raid in Oruzgan in July killed more than 40 civilians,
according to Afghan authorities, who say that many of those who died
were celebrating at a wedding party.</TE>
<TE>   Results of investigations by the United States and a separate U.N.
fact-finding group have not yet been released.</TE>
<TE>   It was not known whether the troops injured Sunday were part of
the investigation. U.S. troops have also been pursuing remnants of Al

<HD>Labor Bills Test Davis the Centrist</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor will try to balance interests of
business as he considers proposed legislation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Shortly after Gray Davis was elected governor in 1998, jubilant labor
leaders--statehouse pariahs during 16 years of Republican
rule--handed the victorious Democrat a lengthy wish list.</LD>
<LD>   Davis scanned labor's pie-in-the-sky priorities for his first year
in office, then offered a gentle rebuke. His advice to labor, aides
recall: Spread the shopping spree over four years.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the final legislative session of Davis' first term draws
to a close nearly four years later, labor groups are lined up at the
Capitol checkout counter with a cart full of bills.</LD>
<TE>   For Davis, who has courted and cashed checks from unions and
business groups alike, the 20-odd pieces of labor legislation about
to land on his desk might just as well be a basket of political hand
grenades.</TE>
<TE>   At stake are the interests of two key Davis constituencies, labor
and business, and the governor's goal of preserving politically
beneficial relationships with the natural rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Labor unions have been the single biggest source of financial
support for the Davis reelection effort, accounting for more than 13%
of the governor's campaign donations at one point earlier this year,
a Times analysis found.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, business groups have given generously to the
governor, and the continued patronage of this traditionally
Republican bloc provides substance to Davis' claim to rule from the
center.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor doesn't see it as an either/or proposition," said
Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "You can be pro-family and
can be good for business."</TE>
<TE>   But in the days ahead, Davis' political dexterity will be tested
as he weighs union pressure to sign their bills against appeals that
he veto what business groups are calling labor's "job-killer"
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Labor advocates insist their legislative offensive isn't an
election-season strategy to force Davis to sign bills he otherwise
might veto--or pay a price at the polls in November. Other Capitol
lobbyists and business interests, however, contend that labor, and
liberal legislators who disdain Davis' professed centrist philosophy,
are trying to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   "Organized labor knows that with the power they have in the
Legislature, they can get almost every bill to [Davis'] desk," said
Tom Nassif, president of the Western Growers Assn., a farmers group
that is battling a bill that would give unionized farm workers
binding arbitration in contract negotiations. "I don't think [labor
unions] do him any favor when he has to decide between the future of
the California economy and agriculture and having to do them a
favor."</TE>
<TE>   Of all the labor-sponsored bills heading toward Davis' desk in the
coming days, SB 1736--binding arbitration for farm workers--seems
destined to generate the most political grief for him. The bill is
sponsored by the United Farm Workers union and authored by Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), a Davis nemesis.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW and its hand-to-mouth members aren't major campaign
contributors, but the union packs a powerful symbolic punch as the
bearer of the banner raised on behalf of California farm workers by
the late Cesar Chavez. The union has launched a Chavez-inspired
campaign of marches, fasts and vigils to pressure Davis to sign the
bill, or to embarrass the governor if he doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, Davis isn't tipping his hand. His spokesman says the
governor will be guided by his middle-of-the-road instincts on SB
1736 and the other labor bills.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the wish list of both labor and business, I think
you can tick off things that have made both business and labor
angry," Maviglio said. "When [the California Chamber of Commerce]
'job-killer' list comes out, the governor does pay attention to this,
just as he pays attention to labor's priority list. He's very careful
of charting a centrist course."</TE>
<TE>   An example cited by Davis supporters is workers' compensation.
Unions were frustrated by the governor's three consecutive vetoes of
labor-sponsored bills expanding coverage for injured workers before
he finally signed a modified bill in February.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups carped about Davis driving up their costs, and
some business lobbyists are still furious they were excluded from the
legislation's final fine-tuning. But more forgiving business
advocates note that the governor parried union demands for three
years and headed off a potentially costly ballot initiative
threatened by unions and their supporters in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in the bigger picture, the governor has been very fair
with the [agriculture] industry," said Don Gordon, president of the
Agricultural Council of California, which represents farm
cooperatives and associations around the state. "The governor has
been fairly consistent in being the sort of moderate centrist that he
is."</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Davis is that labor and business have vastly
different definitions of centrist, leaving both sides feeling abused
by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   On the labor side of the political equation, the disaffection of
the California Teachers Assn. highlights the governor's mixed reviews
among the state's unions.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are very angry at Davis," said Wayne Johnson, president
of the powerful state teachers union. "They feel betrayed by him.
He's been, I think, very pro-business, and there's nothing wrong with
that. But he didn't really do the kinds of things for labor and
teachers they anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   The same sort of grousing echoes from business groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Over a four-year period, 100% of the labor agenda has been put
before [Davis] and he's signed at least 75% of it," said Julianne
Broyles, a veteran lobbyist for the California Chamber of Commerce.
"A lot of things are being delivered to his desk that we hoped he
would have vetoed and a lot of previous governors would have
[vetoed]."</TE>
<TE>   Even worse, says Willie Washington, a lobbyist for the California
Manufacturers and Technology Assn., what labor hasn't already gotten
from Davis, "they have in the oven as we speak."</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by the workers' compensation victory and encouraged by
liberal state lawmakers, the California Labor Federation,
AFL-CIO--the state's largest labor umbrella group--has bombarded the
Legislature with 27 bills.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd love for [Davis] to have signed all these bills in Year
One," said Art Pulaski, the federation's leader. "We respect what
he's done for working families. [But] 27 bills in the hopper now
suggest that our druthers would have been he had done more."</TE>
<TE>   Labor's blitz is ambitious in its breadth.</TE>
<TE>   SB 1661, for example, would provide California workers with paid
family leave for medical emergencies or the birth, adoption or
foster-care placement of a new child. Union officials say the bill
resolves the predicament of families that can't afford to take the
unpaid family leave allowed under California law.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't need it 20 years ago because one spouse was at home,
but nowadays families can't afford to have a spouse at home and not
working," Pulaski said. "It doesn't cost much money. That's the thing
the business community cries the most about, when CEOs are walking
away with millions of dollars or in some cases hundreds of millions."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the proposal would force businesses and workers to
pay billions of dollars in new taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very anti-business bill," Broyles said. "This is not any
time to be looking at a bill like this."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, business groups say virtually all of the pending labor
bills would drive up costs--and drive some companies out of business.</TE>
<TE>   AB 2989, for one, would require California companies that offer
management severance packages to also compensate rank-and-file
workers who lose their jobs. Labor advocates say the bill would deter
companies from cutting jobs merely to impress Wall Street or boost
executive pay.</TE>
<TE>   AB 2242 would give workers earning the minimum wage annual
cost-of-living increases, reversing a trend of declining purchasing
power for the poorest workers, labor groups say. The bill also would
increase penalties for employers who fail to pay the minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   AB 2957 would require a company to notify workers and government
agencies 60 days before a mass layoff, relocation or termination but
goes beyond the federal requirement for such notifications. BH</TE>
<TE>   Labor leaders contend these and other bills would merely return
California workers to the point where they were in 1982, when George
Deukmejian was elected governor and ushered in 16 years of Republican
control of the California governor's office. They say Davis' go-slow
approach has forced them to flood the Legislature with bills the
governor wouldn't sign in his first three years in office.</TE>
<TE>   "There are choices to make," said Marc Grossman, chief spokesman
for the United Farm Workers union.</TE>
<TE>   "You can anger a couple of dozen rich people, or you can help the
poorest of the poor with some modest social justice."</TE>
<TE>   Business groups fear that the sheer number of pending bills
virtually ensures that labor will win passage of some of its
proposals, even if it loses some high-profile battles.</TE>
<TE>   The political costs of Davis' choices won't become clear until the
Nov. 5 election, but the stumbling campaign of Republican challenger
Bill Simon Jr. could shield the governor from serious damage, labor
and political experts say. California businesses, in fact, have gone
beyond hedging their bets, contributing heavily to Davis and
sparingly to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   The California Labor Federation has endorsed Davis, although
Johnson, the teachers union leader, says labor support for the
governor is "very unenthusiastic."</TE>
<TE>   Pulaski is more generous in his praise. However, he does suggest
that union members might work harder on Davis' behalf if the governor
remembers his friends as he reviews their bills.</TE>
<TE>   "For every one of these bills that the governor signs, he's going
to get more votes," the labor federation leader said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how many labor bills Davis approves, Pulaski insists
that the Democratic governor will have merely shaken the status
quo--not turned the world upside-down.</TE>
<TE>   "It was outrageous we were left out for all those years because of
partisan politics," Pulaski said. "We just wanted to level the
playing field, and we have achieved that. If only Gray Davis had been
as responsive to us as the previous administrations had been to
business."</TE>

<HD>Wildlife Shares Nest With Profit</HD>
<DH>Nature Conservancy defends 'working' landscapes, says it
can both produce gas and protect rare birds. Other activists
disagree.</DH>

<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEXAS CITY, Texas</DL>
<LD>On a swath of grassland, tucked among belching refineries, a power
plant and a busy highway, sits the last known breeding ground on
Earth for one of North America's most endangered birds. There are
fewer than 40 of the ungainly Attwater's prairie chickens left in the
wild, half of them here at the Nature Conservancy's Texas City
Prairie Preserve.</LD>
<LD>   Yet when the Nature Conservancy, the world's wealthiest
environmental organization, was given this 2,263-acre oil field by
Mobil Oil Corp. in 1995 because of low production levels, the
nonprofit organization did not shut off the petroleum spigots.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, it drilled new natural gas wells, and kept cattle grazing
too. The conservancy--the 10th largest charity of any kind in the
United States--has reaped $5.2 million in royalties from the preserve
so far.</LD>
<TE>   Conservancy officials insisted that, under their careful
management, neither gas lines nor cattle hoofs will harm the
endangered bird. The conservancy called its prairie chicken preserve
cum petroleum patch a "working" landscape, a harmonious mixture of
commerce and conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Long noted for its low-key, apolitical philosophy of acquiring
land from willing sellers or donors, the conservancy under a new boss
is forging closer ties with industries that other environmentalists
often think of as the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's time we all took a walk in the oilman's shoes," said
Niki McDaniel, spokesman for the Texas Nature Conservancy. "We
believe the opportunity we have in Texas City to raise significant
sums of money for conservation is one we cannot pass up, provided we
are convinced we can do this drilling without harming the prairie
chickens and their habitat. And we are convinced."</TE>
<TE>   Others disagreed, saying that, even if there has not been a
pipeline blowout, for instance, it is impossible to eliminate all
risk. They said that development, including oil and gas refineries,
is what devastated the bird's habitat to begin with.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me be generous," said Clait E. Braun, president of the
Wildlife Society, and one of the nation's leading experts on prairie
chickens and other grouse. "There are no data to indicate that the
Attwater's prairie chicken can coexist with oil and gas drilling. All
the evidence indicates clearly that what you get is a fragmentary
population straggling toward extinction."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of the 7 million acres that the conservancy said it is
protecting in the United States is now being grazed, logged, farmed,
drilled or put to work in some fashion. The money earned from such
activities--about $7 million this year--is less than 1% of the
group's $732 million in annual revenues.</TE>
<TE>   The Nature Conservancy, which turned 50 last year, was founded by
New York state residents who bought a small piece of land near the
Hudson River to keep it from being developed. That "bucks for acres"
concept caught on, spawning other national land trusts, open space
initiatives and preservation efforts. The conservancy distinguished
itself by focusing on acquiring biologically significant lands.</TE>
<TE>   The organization has long prided itself on collaboration, rather
than confrontation. That has paid off handsomely in corporate
donations and government contracts, from the world's largest oil,
paper, automobile and software companies and the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   A list of donors to its recent $1-billion Campaign for
Conservation is a who's who of American industry--in the $20 million
or more category are General Motors and the David and Lucille Packard
Foundation of Silicon Valley fame. In the $10-million to $20-million
category are mega-developer Donald Bren and American Electric Power.
Chevron Texaco Corp. pitched in $5 million to $10 million, and Centex
Homes, Georgia Pacific timber and paper company, Arrow Last &amp;
Livestock Inc. and Public Service Co. of New Mexico each gave between
$2.5 million and $5 million. The organization also has nearly 1
million individual members, who pitched in more than $200 million
last year.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several years, under the leadership of John Sawhill,
the organization adopted new fund-raising and conservation tactics,
from licensing its name to granola bar and coffee bean companies to
doing research funded by General Motors on climate change. GM could
win mitigation credits for greenhouse gas emissions it causes as a
result of the research, according to a footnote in the conservancy's
latest tax filings.</TE>
<TE>   "Land acquisition will always be an important tool, but not
necessarily the major tool" of the organization, said its national
spokesman, Jordan Peavey.</TE>
<TE>   A key in-house architect of the changes was Steve McCormick, 50,
longtime head of the California Nature Conservancy, who became
executive director of the entire organization last year, after
Sawhill died.</TE>
<TE>   Petroleum, timber and farming royalties made up the bulk of the
Texas chapter's budget in 2001--$6.5 million of $7.6 million--and the
lion's share of that was gas royalties from the Texas City Prairie
Preserve. But McCormick said the primary aim of the "working"
landscapes is not to make money. In numerous cases, the conservancy
is paying ranchers, farmers and others to use more environmentally
friendly practices, he said.</TE>
<TE>   McCormick conceded that there are potential biological risks to a
strategy that puts industry side by side with conservation. But it is
a necessary strategy, he said, because buying isolated fragments of
land has not been enough to protect rare species that need whole
mountain ranges or watersheds stretching hundreds of square miles.</TE>
<TE>   There will never be enough money to buy such vast stretches, he
said. The solution, he said, is to stitch together habitat by forging
partnerships with ranchers, timber companies and other rural
landowners who have often opposed environmental laws, such as the
Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   "Our desire is to work with those rural communities in ways that
respect their culture, respect their economies ... but in a fashion
that is compatible with preservation of endangered species,"
McCormick said.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that risky terrain? Yes, it is, because it puts us in a
position of working with extractive uses" such as oil drilling, he
said. "But the alternative is to stand on the side wishing it weren't
so."</TE>
<TE>   Critics said that doesn't justify the conservancy's taking similar
risks on its own land.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the founders of this organization on a first-name basis,
and they would be turning over in their graves," said Huey Johnson, a
Northern California environmentalist who was the Nature Conservancy's
first Western region manager, 40 years ago. "It would take just one
dumb move to destroy the integrity accumulated over 50 years by this
organization."</TE>
<TE>   "There are millions of acres being logged already by timber
companies, millions of acres being grazed by private cattle ranches.
Why does the Nature Conservancy have to become a timber baron?" asked
Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological
Diversity, which has the same mission as the conservancy, but uses
lawsuits and other adversarial tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Conservancy officials and supporters said they provide a valuable
example by demonstrating on their own lands that conservation and
commerce can go hand in hand.</TE>
<TE>   In New England, as paper companies have sold off whole forests in
recent years, the conservancy has participated in deals on nearly a
million acres of Maine and New Hampshire woods, McCormick said.
Though some small pieces will be preserved, most of the land will
continue to be logged. The forests will be thinned rather than shorn
of trees, using "sustainable" forestry practices.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy is far different from those of other environmental
groups in the region, which have pushed for the creation of a
national park.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea of a park, with a loss of forestry jobs and
restrictions on motorized recreation, is not popular with many
residents. That includes workers at paper factories, hunters and
snowmobilers who have ranged freely on the privately owned backwoods
for centuries. Under the conservancy's stewardship, those traditions
will continue.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southwest, where conservancy staff members said encroaching
subdivisions represent the single greatest environmental threat, the
group now controls 2.1 million acres of livestock range, including
ranches it has bought and interests in other lands. The conservancy
has even funded a business venture called Conservation Beef to market
hormone-free steaks described on the venture's Internet site as
"rapturously tender, undeniably charismatic" and "like the free-range
beef our grandparents grew up on."</TE>
<TE>   "Your purchase of Conservation Beef is worth feeling good about.
You're becoming a partner in helping us protect the Great American
West," the Web site says.</TE>
<TE>   Conservancy officials said they are moving cattle from place to
place to protect stream beds and using other ecologically sound
measures. They said that all ranchers they work with must follow
rigorous plans for land stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the partnerships have on occasion put the conservancy in
the position of siding with ranchers against other environmentalists.
In 1999, 18 Arizona environmental groups wrote a joint letter to the
organization, asking the conservancy to stop siding with ranchers in
negotiations to change federal and state environmental laws governing
grazing and to stop perpetuating "myths about environmental
protection and rancher(s) which are flatly untrue."</TE>
<TE>   As for the conservancy's argument that by "working" its own land
it is showing private landowners that business ventures can prosper
under an environmental ethos, some of those landowners disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say it's the opposite, in fact. It would be our view that
they would learn from us," said a spokesman for Exxon Mobil Corp.,
Bob Davis, noting that many of the environmentally sensitive industry
practices used by the conservancy on its Texas City preserve had been
developed by Exxon and Mobil researchers. But Davis said that the
company supports sustainable development and that the conservancy's
petroleum production on the preserve is "admirable."</TE>
<TE>   Some ranchers and property-rights advocates said the nonprofit's
deep pockets enable it to take steps that private, for-profit owners
would find difficult--grazing fewer cattle per acre, for example, or
keeping the animals out of stream beds during drought years.</TE>
<TE>   The larger question is whether working landscapes actually provide
protection for fragile terrain and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is not whether working landscapes are a good idea in
the abstract, but whether it's a good or a bad idea for a particular
species," said Michael Bean, director of the wildlife division of
Environmental Defense. "I certainly am not prepared to say it's
always a good idea."</TE>
<TE>   But Bean said that the conservancy has an "outstanding track
record" of preserving land and that, in specific cases, research has
shown the approach could work.</TE>
<TE>   "The Nature Conservancy fills an important niche. [It] accepts
money from large corporations and big polluters who we could not take
money from," said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Waterkeeper
movement, which works to clean up U.S. waters. "But it's possible to
compromise your ideology, your reputation by making too risky
choices."</TE>
<TE>   Braun, the grouse expert, is more critical: "The Nature
Conservancy is speaking out of both sides of its mouth: 'We can have
this wildlife, and we can make money too.' ... Well, that's not
true," he said. "They're exploiting the Attwater's prairie chicken to
make money."</TE>
<TE>   At the conservancy's Texas City Prairie Preserve, none of the more
than $2 million set aside to help in the bird's recovery had been
spent as of this spring. Conservancy officials and others said the
money will be vital to fund captive breeding programs; to try to
persuade a host of other wary private landowners to set aside
additional habitat for the birds; and to reseed prairie grasses.</TE>
<TE>   The homely bird once numbered about a million, its habitat
stretching across the Texas and Louisiana coastal prairies. In
pioneer days, it was a familiar figure, strutting across dusty
farmyards and oil fields, the males flapping and "booming" loudly
during the spring mating season.</TE>
<TE>   They are a Southern cousin of another bird greatly reduced in
number--the prairie chickens of the Midwestern prairies.</TE>
<TE>   Like them, the Attwater's has been pushed almost out of existence
by over-hunting, overgrazing, farming, roads and other development.</TE>
<TE>   "Their habitat is now Houston, NASA and Galveston," said Mark
Klym, a biologist who runs a fund-raising
effort--"Adopt-A-Prairie-Chicken"--for Texas Parks and Wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The prairie chickens aren't the only ones crowded onto this
remnant coastal grassland.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of bird species are visible on a given day--many of them
raptors that could wipe out the tenuous Attwater's population for
breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   As for the drilling and grazing on the preserve, conservancy
officials insisted that rigorous protections are in place and that
there is no evidence of harm from the commercial activities.</TE>
<TE>   Surface pumping is confined to small areas, and drilling is
limited to months when there is no mating and nesting.</TE>
<TE>   Close to 50,000 nonnative Chinese tallow trees that threatened to
choke out native grasses vital to the chicken's survival have been
ripped out.</TE>
<TE>   As for grazing, state fish and game biologists said the cattle
help to create the clumpy patches of grassland that the bird needs,
much as bison historically did.</TE>
<TE>   But even those who think that the conservancy is making valiant
efforts to preserve the bird have misgivings.</TE>
<TE>   Staff members at the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, the
Houston branch of the Audubon Society and area federal regulators
said there always will be a risk, however small, of a major pipeline
blowout, a bad spill or even the gradual sinking of the bird's mating
ground as natural gas is sucked out from underneath.</TE>
<TE>   And for all the intensive restoration work, without the regular
release of captive-bred birds here and elsewhere, the species
probably would already be gone, said Braun and others.</TE>
<TE>   "The Attwater's prairie chicken doesn't really exist anymore,"
said Braun, noting that many of the introduced birds have been
crossbred with Midwestern prairie chickens.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not extinct, but that's in name only," Braun said. "All I
can say is, it's a poor end for a fine American bird."</TE>

<HD>National Seashore Washing Out With Bush Administration</HD>
<DH>California coast: 'Land acquisition is not a priority,'
federal official says of proposed park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUELLTON, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Monday edged away from a Clinton-era
proposal to create a national seashore on one of the last undeveloped
stretches of Southern California's coast, just north of Santa
Barbara. The administration's reaction came during a meeting here to
review a National Park Service study to establish a Gaviota National
Seashore. Such a designation would protect 46 miles of dramatic
cliffs, remote beaches and terraced grasslands. It could also halt
the advance of urban sprawl by buying land for permanent
conservation.</LD>
<LD>   In the weeks leading up to the meeting, U.S. Department of the
Interior officials had expressed interest in coming up with a plan
that would offer protection for the land while honoring private
property rights.</LD>
<LD>   But the tone was standoffish Monday as Lynn Scarlett, assistant
secretary of the Interior, distanced the administration from any plan
that would establish a national park.</LD>
<TE>   "This administration and this Interior secretary are operating
with a vision: private stewardship of land, partnerships with private
landowners and retaining working [agricultural] landscapes. Land
acquisition is not a priority of this administration."</TE>
<TE>   Although the administration convened the meeting, local
environmentalists dismissed it as a forum to give opponents a chance
to shoot down the plan.</TE>
<TE>   It was part of "an effort to kill the national seashore through
delays and meetings with deliberately hostile ranchers and property
rights groups," said Mark Massara, manager of the Sierra Club's
coastal program.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) called for the national seashore
feasibility study, which the Park Service began working on in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Applauded by conservationists, the proposal is an anathema to
others, including owners of small parcels of land and some very large
developers. They seethe at the prospect of rules and restrictions
that can accompany government designations of public parks and
preserves. They fear a national seashore would limit how they could
use or market their land.</TE>
<TE>   Scarlett, who lives in Santa Barbara, said that she has no
personal vision for the Gaviota Coast and that it would be
inappropriate for her to have one. Instead, she said, her goal is to
be fair to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 13 months, she said, she talked to residents and
property owners and detected signs of common ground, including a love
of the land and a willingness to consider some form of conservation,
providing it was not forced on people by Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard from almost everybody that whatever happens it should be
through local action, not federal action. And, 'Gee, a big federal
presence? We don't think that's a good idea.' "</TE>
<TE>   So Scarlett helped arranged Monday's meeting, which was sponsored
by the National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   Scarlett said she was not prepared for the verbal bashing the
administration has taken since the announcement of the meeting
earlier this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I was perhaps Pollyannaish in my notion that good intentions
would be enough," said Scarlett, a former director of the
Libertarian-leaning Reason Public Policy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The angriest reaction has come from property rights activists,
people the administration has sought to mollify with its emphasis on
local control of land use decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Blame this one on George Bush, not Bill Clinton," reads an action
alert issued last week from the American Land Rights Assn. "A
top-level Bush administration appointee, ... Lynn Scarlett, has
joined forces with a left-wing extreme enviro member of Congress,
Santa Barbara's Representative Lois Capps.</TE>
<TE>   "Together they are attempting to jam a 215,000-acre national park
down the throats of unwilling residents, all in the name of currying
favor with the politically powerful environmental lobby."</TE>
<TE>   The scolding continued Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to know, what's the difference between a national park
study and stealing?" asked one rancher.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal Threat</TE>
<TE>   "What I see as the biggest threat to the Gaviota coast is those
who want to save it," said Nancy Crawford-Hall of the Santa Barbara
Cattlemen's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service study focuses on 200,000 acres from Coal Oil
Point on the UC Santa Barbara campus in Isla Vista to Point Sal at
the northern boundary of Vandenberg Air Force Base.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force controls nearly half of the area, about 102,000
acres, followed by the 24,500-acre Bixby Ranch, which straddles Point
Conception and has sought in recent years to subdivide its historic
family cattle ranch among heirs.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Padres National Forest is the third-largest landowner,
with about 20,000 acres in the study area. It's followed by the
Hollister Ranch, a gated community of ranchettes of 100 acres or more
with celebrity owners who include movie producer James Cameron and
singer-songwriter Jackson Browne.</TE>
<TE>   Private property owners from the Hollister Ranch and elsewhere
sued the Park Service three times to short-circuit the study. All
three attempts were rebuffed by a federal judge.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollister Ranch Homeowners Assn. assessed its members at least
$300,000 to hire a former congressman in Washington as its lobbyist
to scuttle the study or influence its outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Hollister Ranch has tried to keep its eight miles of beachfront
closed even though the California Coastal Act specifically calls for
public access to that stretch of coast. Visiting surfers have written
to the National Park Service, complaining about being driven off at
gunpoint when they tried to reach some spots by boat. Some of them
have joined the push for a national seashore.</TE>
<TE>   But that pressure has come mostly from environmentalists who fear
that development will spread up the coast from fast-growing Goleta.</TE>
<TE>   The northward push has already begun. The 360-room Bacara Hotel
and Spa recently opened on a piece of undisturbed shoreline. A golf
course and luxury home subdivision is proposed a bit farther up the
coast at Naples Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A number of nearby ranches have been sold in recent years to
developers or real estate speculators. Other land owners have
indicated an interest in developing. They have not renewed contracts
to preserve agricultural land in exchange for lower property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the history of Southern California, you have to
ask yourself, 'Why would development stop here?' " said Mike
Lunsford, president of the Gaviota Coast Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the largest remnant of non-urbanized coast in Southern
California. If you look down the coast, with the exemption of Camp
Pendleton, it's all gone."</TE>
<TE>   Park officials said they have no choice but to finish the study
because it was ordered by Congress in 1999. After much delay, the
first draft is set for release in January.</TE>
<TE>   The draft will not make a recommendation, but rather spell out
five options, including establishing a national seashore, doing
nothing, enhancing state and local protections or setting up a
national reserve or preserve. The final report, after 90 days of
public comment, will recommend to Congress what option is best.</TE>
<TE>   A national seashore would offer the most protection. It would
designate a specific area that would allow the Park Service to set up
a program for buying land, establishing a coastal trail and public
access ways to the beaches, and preserving Chumash Indian sites as
well as habitat for 13 endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   But Park Service officials said they would have no control over
private property and would not force the sale of private land.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Scarlett said, "The Park Service has done other
feasibility studies, and whenever the local folks don't want a park
presence the Park Service has walked away."</TE>

<HD>Black Bear Grabs, Kills Infant in N.Y.</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FALLSBURG, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A bear killed a 5-month-old girl Monday after knocking her out of a
stroller and dragging her into the woods, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The baby had been in her stroller near the porch of a vacation
bungalow with family members when the black bear approached, said
Fallsburg Police Chief Brent Lawrence.</LD>
<LD>   The mother hurried her two other children inside, Lawrence said.
When she came back for the baby, it was gone.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses told police the young bear had the infant, Ester
Schwimmer, in its mouth as it ambled into dense woods 20 feet from
the family's Catskills' bungalow.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be the first season that it may have been on its own, and
it may very well have perceived this infant as a food source,"
Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   Isaac Abraham, another vacationer, said people desperately tried
to save the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "People started chasing the bear, throwing rocks at it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bear dropped the infant, but she had severe injuries to her
head and neck, and was pronounced dead at a hospital, Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers with the Department of Environmental Conservation and
local police tracked the bear into the woods and shot it.</TE>
<TE>   Ward Stone, the state's chief wildlife pathologist, said it was
the first time he could remember a black bear killing a human.</TE>

<LD>The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that a judge whose sloppy

bench.</LD>
<LD>   Criminal District Judge Sharon Hunter went on leave in March,
before a hearing on whether she should be suspended. The state
Supreme Court suspended her with pay in June, and decided unanimously
Monday that she should not return.</LD>
<LD>   In its ruling, the court said the 11 cases--which included four
murder convictions--were reversed because Hunter failed to produce
transcripts in time, accurately or not at all.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wealthy publicist accused of injuring 16 people when she backed her
sport-utility vehicle into a crowd at a trendy Hamptons nightclub is
apparently on the verge of a plea bargain.</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Grubman, 31, has pleaded not guilty in a 26-count
indictment that includes charges of assault, leaving the scene of an
accident and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman could plead guilty as early as Friday in exchange for
serving at least 60 days in a special lockup that provides counseling
for alcohol abuse, according to two people close to Grubman who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Grubman was charged with backing her Mercedes into a crowd of
partygoers outside Conscience Point Inn in Southampton in July 2001.
Lawyers for some of the injured said they did not object to a plea
deal, which would require a judge's approval.</TE>

<HD>As Man Waits in Prison, Sibling Admits to Crime</HD>
<DH>Robbery: A third felony conviction put James Byrd away for
30 years. His brother eventually confessed, but not everyone believes
him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>About the robbery, this much is certain: In the spring of 1997, a man
driving a mustard yellow Subaru pulled up to a house on the east side
of Fort Worth. The driver eased out of the car, strolled into an open
garage and stole a leaf blower and lawn edger.</LD>
<LD>   The homeowner, Sandee White, ran outside and screamed at the thief
to stop. "Get back or I'll shoot you," he shouted back, gesturing
with what appeared to be a gun in his pocket. White scribbled down
his license plate number as he sped away.</LD>
<LD>   The event marked the beginning of a long, unhappy trail for a
two-time felon named James Byrd, who was sentenced to 30 years in
prison for the aggravated robbery. The case fractured Byrd's family,
who insisted that his brother Donnie Johnson stole the lawn gear to
support a crack cocaine habit. Now Johnson has confessed. And yet
White remains convinced that the jury rightly convicted Byrd.</LD>
<TE>   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is now considering Byrd's
petition for clemency--which is backed by the district attorney's
office that prosecuted him but not by the victim of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an ambiguous situation," acknowledged Alan Levy, chief of
the criminal division at the Tarrant County district attorney's
office here. "The law doesn't provide for ambiguity, and that's the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   History of Drug Use</TE>
<TE>   Donnie Johnson steals for drug money. That's just a fact, said his
mother, Olivia Byrd, 73. "When Donnie got to have that drug, he got
to have it," she said of Johnson's long-standing pattern of theft,
drug use and prison. "It don't matter if he hurts his own family."</TE>
<TE>   In March 1997, Johnson was fresh out of drug rehabilitation and
broke. He asked his younger brother James to sign for a car loan.
Byrd hesitated, then agreed. "Donnie had a drug problem, but people
can change," said Byrd, who knew about second chances.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd already had served two jail sentences, for possession of
cocaine and for theft. When he got out of prison in 1995, he found a
$13-an-hour job rebuilding automobile drive shafts. He bought a small
house and moved in with his fiancee and two children. "I grew up," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Donnie will make it this time, Byrd thought as the car
salesman slid the loan papers across the desk.</TE>
<TE>   The man driving the Subaru hatchback robbed White a few months
later. Fort Worth police traced the car to Byrd, whose stomach
lurched when he saw the police at his front door. "I told them,
'Y'all must have me mistaken for my brother Donnie. I signed for the
car, but it belongs to him.' They said, 'Yeah, right,' and handcuffed
me and took me to jail."</TE>
<TE>   The family begged Johnson to confess. "Your life ain't going to
get no better till you tell the truth," scolded his sister Ammy
Sewell. "James is your brother. Do right by him." Johnson wavered. No
one in the family thought a jury would convict Byrd. Though their
stories sometimes conflicted, a dozen alibi witnesses, including his
supervisor at work, put him elsewhere at the time of the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Gamble Didn't Pay Off</TE>
<TE>   Johnson would later say, "I gambled on my brother winning his
trial." He testified that on the day of the robbery, he had lent the
car to a friend, who must have taken the lawn equipment. Prosecutors
later told jurors that the friend was in jail when White was robbed.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, White insisted that it was Byrd who rummaged through
her garage as if it were a hardware store. "I'm not an 80-year-old
woman with cataracts who couldn't see who it was. It was broad
daylight and I could clearly see his face," the 48-year-old said
recently.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are sitting on that witness stand and someone's life is
in your hands, you want to be absolutely sure that you know what
you're talking about," she said. "I am positively 100% sure that
James Byrd threatened my life and stole from me."</TE>
<TE>   The jury believed White and, because it was Byrd's third felony
conviction, sent him to jail for 30 years as a habitual criminal. "I
had a steady job, a house, and money in the bank," said Byrd, 38.
"Why would I steal a Weed Eater?"</TE>
<TE>   After that, the 45-year-old Johnson knew no peace. The family
pressured him for a year before he signed a confession in January
1999. "I committed the robbery for which my brother James was
convicted," it read. "I am a drug addict and this particular theft
was one of many that I have committed in order to get money to supply
my drug habit."</TE>
<TE>   But the Texas Court of Appeals denied without comment a motion to
consider the confession.</TE>
<TE>   'I Am Innocent'</TE>
<TE>   Five years passed as Byrd cleared prison cafeteria tables by day
and studied law books at night. He wrote to dozens of people for
help, carefully noting their names on a square of gray cardboard that
came to represent his ticket out of prison. "I am innocent," Byrd
wrote to lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and TV talk show host Montel
Williams, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Other inmates rolled their eyes. "They said, 'Everybody's innocent
in jail.' Then they laughed. No one believed me," Byrd said.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Cathy Helenhouse, a second-year law student, was
assigned to look into Byrd's case as part of a class at the
University of Houston. She reviewed Byrd's file and found herself
drawn to long letters from his family. "They were just begging for
help," she said. "All these questions were coming to my mind and you
wonder, did this really happen?"</TE>
<TE>   After she told a Fort Worth television reporter about Byrd, a
local defense attorney took up the case. In June, after polygraph
examiner Eric Holden concluded that Byrd and Johnson were telling the
truth, Tarrant County Dist. Atty. Tim Curry wrote to the state Board
of Pardons and Paroles.</TE>
<TE>   "From our own experience, and from his reputation in the law
enforcement community, we can be confident that Mr. Holden's
conclusions are reliable," Curry wrote. "At this point, we are no
longer certain of Mr. Byrd's guilt. Given the unique facts of the
case, including the complete absence of physical or scientific
evidence, the polygraph results have created a doubt that he is
actually guilty of this crime."</TE>
<TE>   Similar letters followed from State District Judge Sharen Wilson,
who presided over Byrd's trial, and Tarrant County Sheriff Dee
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Victim, Police Opposed</TE>
<TE>   White also has written the board--to fight Byrd's release. "When I
first found out what was happening, I thought, 'Oh my God, he has an
identical brother and I made the wrong identification.' But they do
not even look alike. The right man is in prison," she said. White
fears that Byrd will be released despite her efforts to keep him in
jail. She has sold her house and is moving, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief of the Fort Worth Police Department also opposes Byrd's
release. "What's interesting to us is that the case to release him is
based on a polygraph examination, which is not admissible at trial,"
police spokesman Lt. Jesse Hernandez said. "We have decisive
eyewitness testimony and a thorough investigation. This is what the
jury considered, and they found him guilty."</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen a case like this before," said Levy, the Fort
Worth prosecutor. "I'd be very hesitant if not for the interlocking
polygraphs. I'll be surprised if it meets muster at the parole
commission, but it might."</TE>
<TE>   It's unknown when the parole board might take up the case.</TE>
<TE>   But at the Gurney prison unit southeast of Dallas, Byrd already is
planning a new life. He'll finally get married and find a new job. He
thinks about Johnson, who cried and apologized to Byrd during an
emotional televised meeting, their first in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Not long afterward, police in nearby Mansfield arrested Johnson in
a separate burglary and on suspicion of drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   "Donnie's in the house [jail] again," his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "It never ends."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Jailed Over Alleged Terrorist Links Will Be
Deported</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian imprisoned twice for immigration violations and
suspected terrorist ties will be released this week from a federal
prison and deported to a Middle Eastern country, his attorneys said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Mazen Al-Najjar, 45, has been held since November on a deportation
order for overstaying his visa, which was issued 20 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Al-Najjar, who has never been charged with a crime, has been held
in solitary confinement at the federal prison in Coleman, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no justification for the fact he's been detained all this
time and there's no justification for sending him to a country and
splitting him up from his family," said Martin Schwartz, one of the
attorneys involved in Al-Najjar's case.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Najjar was jailed from 1997 to the end of 2000 on secret
evidence that he helped support terrorists through an Islamic think
tank and charity he founded with his brother-in-law, Sami Al-Arian.
Both men consistently have denied any connection to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Najjar was free for nearly a year but was taken into custody
again for the visa violation after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He will be deported this week, but an exact time of deportation
will not be released for security reasons, said Rodney Germain, an
Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Najjar has acquired travel documents from the Palestinian
Authority and will be deported to an Arab country "with friendly
relations with the United States," such as Egypt, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar or Bahrain, said Joe Hohenstein, another
attorney for Al-Najjar.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard concluded in February that the
government had legitimate reasons for keeping Al-Najjar behind bars
for at least six months while trying to deport him.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Najjar's wife, Fedaa, is also under a deportation order and is
trying to find a country that will accept her, so that at some point
she and her three U.S.-born daughters can be reunited with Mazen
Al-Najjar, Hohenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Arian, a tenured computer science professor at the University
of South Florida, has been on paid leave since September. University
President Judy Genshaft is expected to decide whether to fire him
before fall semester classes begin next week.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Arian is the former head of a university-based Islamic study
think tank and charity the FBI has accused of being a front for
terrorists. He denies any wrongdoing and denies knowing that speakers
his group sponsored were terrorists. Al-Arian has never been
arrested.</TE>

<HD>Students' Reading of Koran Text Is Upheld</HD>
<DH>Islam: The ruling rejects a conservative Christian group's
federal appeal to halt study of the book by the University of North
Carolina's freshmen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court on Monday tersely turned down an attempt by a
conservative Christian group to halt the University of North Carolina
from using a text on the Islamic holy book, the Koran, to teach new
students.</LD>
<LD>   Without elaborating on the reasoning behind its decision, the U.S.
4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., said lawyers for the
Family Policy Network had "failed to satisfy the requirements" for
halting the study program. The decision upheld a lower federal court
ruling in Charlotte, N.C., last week allowing the university to use
the book.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit had become a dividing line between conservatives who
questioned the use of uncritical texts on Islam after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, and civil libertarians who feared a chilling
effect on college campuses.</LD>
<TE>   Even as lawyers relayed word of the ruling from Richmond, 180 UNC
professors and administrators were sitting down Monday with more than
4,000 incoming freshmen and transfer students on the Chapel Hill
campus, debating the introduction to the Koran that had been assigned
as a summer reading project.</TE>
<TE>   One of the group leaders was UNC Chapel Hill Chancellor James
Moeser, who said later that "we are clearly delighted with the ruling
of the court."</TE>
<TE>   Huddled for two hours in a classroom with 20 students, Moeser said
the discussion group "spent a lot of time talking about religious
commonalities."</TE>
<TE>   Moeser added that several students, who came from small towns
across the South, told him they had been "harassed for going to a
university that would make them read this book. They were appalled at
the lack of understanding of this project."</TE>
<TE>   UNC Chapel Hill had assigned "Approaching the Qur'an: The Early
Revelations" to the 4,200 incoming students--who started the fall
session this week--as part of an effort to better understand the
religious underpinnings of Muslim culture.</TE>
<TE>   A deeper knowledge of Islam, Moeser reasoned, "helps us from
demonizing a whole group of people who are associated with being an
enemy simply by practicing the same religion" as the Sept. 11
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Family Policy Network officials had claimed that using the book
uncritically was "indoctrination" and had questioned why author
Michael Sells, a professor at Haverford College outside Philadelphia,
had focused on passages in the Koran that could be viewed as inciting
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Moffit, the network's chairman, insisted Monday from his
Virginia office that the group was trying to prevent the school from
forcing students to use the book "as a hard and fast requirement."</TE>
<TE>   Saying the group had no plans to appeal the case to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Moffit said he took the court's ruling as a victory,
even though the use of Sells' book continued. UNC Chapel Hill, Moffit
noted, had agreed in a court brief to allow students to be excused
from reading the book if they submitted an essay explaining their
religious objections.</TE>
<TE>   "The UNC realized they had erred in making it a requirement," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moeser countered that the university had never intended to force
students to learn the text. The reading project occurred before the
official start of school, he said, and "there was never any penalty
for nonparticipation."</TE>
<TE>   Sells also said he was satisfied with the court's ruling, praising
UNC Chapel Hill for doing "what a courageous university should do.
The fact is that this controversy has allowed anger to fester about
Islam generally and promoted people to go on the AM radio shows and
on television."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy also has had a useful side, Sells said, "allowing
people to debate an emotional issue that needs to be talked through."</TE>
<TE>   But Monday's court ruling has not completely settled the issue.
The North Carolina House Appropriations Committee voted this month to
ban using public funds for the UNC assignment unless other religions
get similar attention. The bill is expected to be voted down in the
state Senate, but it still looms.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why you don't want state legislatures controlling
religious instruction," Sells said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 500 known religions in the world."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ROSWELL, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Two thousand missiles seized by federal agents from a
counter-terrorism school in New Mexico were licensed and had been
obtained legally, an official of the training firm said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   David Hudak--president of HEAT, or High Energy Access Tools, an
anti-terrorism and police-training company--was arrested last week on
federal explosives and immigration charges.</LD>
<LD>   Hudak, a Canadian, was taken on Monday to El Paso, where he had an
"identity hearing" with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
His arraignment on federal weapons charges is likely to take place
today in federal court in Las Cruces, N.M., officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said they
found 49 crates of armor-piercing missiles at the school, which had
clients from Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, and believe there
are about another 4,000 pounds of munitions on the premises.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Fish, HEAT's director of security, said Hudak's visa had
expired, but he insisted his boss had obtained the weapons legally.
"The weapons that he had are licensed. We do have the paperwork for
that," Fish said on CBS' "The Early Show."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure after the ATF have finished their look, they'll see that
everything is in order."</TE>
<TE>   The weapons had come through customs legally from Canada and were
on HEAT's inventory, which had been inspected by the ATF, Fish said.</TE>
<TE>   ATF agents said Sunday that they and the FBI had seized more than
2,300 unregistered missiles at the school, but that there was no
reason to think Hudak had any ties to terrorist groups such as Al
Qaeda. They said the missiles were worth about $54 million.</TE>

<HD>Lack of Leads Frustrates Police Seeking Va. Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLLINSVILLE, Va.</DL>
<LD>The search for 9-year-old Jennifer Short stretched into a fifth day
Monday as frustrated authorities said they had found no signs of a
struggle in the home where the girl's parents were slain.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Frank Cassell also confirmed that phone lines to the home
had been cut some time before Thursday's slayings and kidnapping. He
has said the culprit likely knew Michael and Mary Short.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, a search warrant released Monday revealed that
officers had found a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle, a 12-gauge
semiautomatic shotgun, shell casings and boxes of ammunition in the
home.</LD>
<TE>   But there were no signs that the couple or Jennifer resisted the
intruder. Their red brick ranch home was notably uncluttered after
the crimes, Cassell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bedcovers were thrown back and that's about it," he said on NBC's
"Today" show. "Rooms were clean, neat, well-maintained. That's what's
frustrating about this investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the guns and ammunition, investigators seized bedcovers, a
note on paper from the kitchen table and an impression of the words
"I'm glad to see" written on a window.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell said he could not comment on last week's search or on any
evidence. It was not known whether the guns found were linked to the
slayings.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they have picked through the evidence, tips
from around the country and calls from 20 to 30 psychics. Cassell
said they still have few leads.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid it's more of the same," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell said nothing was found Monday in searches of a pond behind
the Shorts' home and horseback canvassing of woods in the area.
Officials were also checking known sex offenders in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Police have not ruled out robbery as a motive for the crimes, but
a bag containing $485 in cash and a $211 check was found on the
kitchen counter, according to the search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell said on "The Early Show" on CBS that authorities are
looking at the crime "from every angle" but that they had not been
able to determine whether the target "was the child or the parents,
or both."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any suspects," he added.</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Security Poor, Lawmaker Says</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Number of guards has been slashed at many sites.
Energy Dept. defends its efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Energy Department has cut security forces at nuclear weapon
installations and other sensitive facilities by nearly 40% in the
last decade, leaving them vulnerable to terrorists, a veteran
Democratic lawmaker charges in a report to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The report by Rep. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts found that
the number of uniformed security guards within the department's
complexes nationwide--including nuclear weapon labs, test sites, the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve and other facilities--had dropped from
5,640 in 1992 to 3,500 in 2001. In addition, Markey found that
security support staff at the installations had dropped to 762 from
1,451 a decade earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Markey also said the department was slow to plan for security and
that its computer systems had been potentially compromised by a
number of serious cyber-attacks.</LD>
<TE>   A 13-term congressman who is a longtime foe of the nuclear power
industry and a critic of U.S. nuclear programs, Markey released the
report after the department responded in detail to concerns he raised
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-page report includes unclassified portions of roughly 250
pages of material the department gave to Markey in May, plus some
information he received in two briefings.</TE>
<TE>   The report's release follows a decision by President Bush last
week to kill $5.1 billion in funding that Congress had approved for
homeland security and other uses--including about $139 million
earmarked for national nuclear security. The department itself had
sought increased security funding this year, but the White House
largely rejected that request.</TE>
<TE>   Assailing Bush's stance, Markey said: "The president is playing a
dangerous game when he vetoes critical security resources." He
maintained that terrorists could infiltrate vulnerable installations
and potentially detonate a "dirty" bomb or the equivalent of a crude
nuclear device.</TE>
<TE>   "Osama bin Laden and his associates have made clear that nuclear
facilities are at the top of their terrorist targets," Markey said in
an interview Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The administration agreed that nuclear security should be a
priority but dismissed Markey's criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "Our weapons complex remains safe and secure, and the protection
systems at our sites are robust, reliable and responsive to evolving
security challenges," Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham wrote to
Markey.</TE>
<TE>   Markey is co-chairman of a congressional nonproliferation task
force and a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   While today's report is entirely Markey's, Congress has made
nuclear security a bipartisan priority in recent years. After
security lapses were exposed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico and elsewhere, Congress in 2000 created the National Nuclear
Security Administration within the Energy Department to strengthen
protection against espionage and terrorism. And last month,
responding in part to the Sept. 11 attacks, lawmakers approved
significant funding increases for energy security as part of a
$29-billion emergency spending bill.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Markey notes reductions in the security forces at
several leading facilities from 1992 to 2001. At Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in Northern California, for example, the number
of armed guards dropped to 124 from 141. At Los Alamos, it dropped to
255 from 322. At a nuclear site in Rocky Flats, Colo., it dropped to
154 from 380.</TE>
<TE>   And, at nonnuclear facilities in Louisiana and Texas, armed guards
protecting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve were reduced to 113 from
233.</TE>
<TE>   In all, five of 30 department installations nationwide had no
armed guards during the reporting period, Markey found, while 17 had
reductions in armed guards. While some of the sites added unarmed
guards during that time, the guard force overall dropped 38%.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Wilkes, a spokesman for the National Nuclear Security
Administration, an agency within the department, called Markey's
report "old news" Monday and added: "Something is trying to be
sensationalized that isn't there." Although he provided no specifics,
he said the government had taken measures since Sept. 11 to bolster
nuclear security, including budgeting an additional $106 million in
December and adding guards at sensitive sites.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes also said that the shifts in security personnel had
occurred mainly during the Clinton administration. He attributed
them, in part, to changing missions at many of the facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In other findings, Markey charged that the department:</TE>
<TE>   * Has been slow to assess new threats to its installations after
Sept. 11, following procedures that could lead to a two-year delay in
implementing protective measures.</TE>
<TE>   * Has found security flaws through training exercises that
included mock terrorist attacks. In one episode in 1998 in Rocky
Flats, Markey said, the department acknowledged that mock terrorists
"were able to use speed, firepower and concealment smoke to penetrate
the facility."</TE>
<TE>   * Has been the target of successful cyber-attacks. However, the
department reported that the number of computer intrusions dropped
from 130 in 1999 to 64 in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Wildfire Is at 'Turning Point,' but Residents Still
Wary</HD>
<DH>Environment: Crews finish containment lines along Rogue
River. Folks not ready to relax yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Hotshot crews shored up the last five miles of containment lines
keeping the Biscuit fire out of the whitewater rafting section of the
Rogue River on Monday, marking a turning point on the biggest blaze
in the state's history.</LD>
<LD>   However, after three weeks of fire in their backyard, residents of
the Rogue River hamlet of Agness were not ready to celebrate yet, and
they were still thinning trees and cutting weeds and brush around
their homes.</LD>
<LD>   "Summer is lost to us all. There is no fun, no relaxing, and it's
probably not going to change," until the fall rains come, said
Deborah Crouse, librarian in this community of about 150 people that
caters to whitewater rafters and fishermen on the Rogue River.</LD>
<TE>   "We definitely have the celebration beer ready. But what we all
know is what the fire is capable of. Those huge wind-generated
firewalls could probably zip right through the fire line they just
made. But every day, [firefighters] are able to do more. Every day,
we feel safer and better."</TE>
<TE>   Helicopters dropped flammable pingpong balls on scattered unburned
islands in the 50,000-acre burnout area on the northeastern flank of
the fire, but the bulk of the burnout that had created ominous
columns of smoke since Friday was done, said Rochelle Desser, a fire
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say we are at a turning point," she said. "We have
completed the initial mission in Zone 1. Now, it's just a matter of
reinforcing it, testing it, and finally saying it is fully contained
on this side."</TE>
<TE>   Ignited July 13 by lightning, the Biscuit fire has grown to
448,857 acres--two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. Overall, it is
40% contained, with 92 miles of fire line left to complete.</TE>
<TE>   The fire in the Siskiyou National Forest in southwestern Oregon
and Northern California is so big that it is being fought in four
zones, each with its own management team. The cost has risen to $80
million, with 6,075 people, 92 bulldozers, 250 fire engines and 42
helicopters involved.</TE>
<TE>   Zone 1 covers the eastern two-thirds of the fire, from the
California line, through the Illinois Valley--where an evacuation
alert for 17,000 people was lifted Friday--and up to Bear Camp Road,
the primary shuttle route between Galice and Agness for rafters on
the wilderness section of the Rogue.</TE>
<TE>   "We would not want to characterize things as all buttoned up yet,
but things are looking very good," Desser said. Firefighters will
soon be shifting from the eastern side of the fire to the western
side, but smoke will continue coming off the fire until it rains.</TE>
<TE>   On the western side, evacuation alerts remained in effect for
Agness, nearby Oak Flat, the upper Pistol River drainage, and the
Wilderness Retreat subdivision on the Chetco River.</TE>
<TE>   However, the danger to those settlements diminished as containment
lines grew and burnout operations continued, said fire spokesman
Wayne Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "The line is not secure, but we've got it completed and are in
mop-up," Johnson said. "Weather forecasters have given us some
favorable weather--higher humidities with a west-northwest
wind--favorable for burnout."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service battled a second fire that blew
up to 6,000 acres over the weekend in the Umpqua National Forest east
of Roseburg, forcing highway and campground closures along the
popular fly-fishing section of the North Umpqua River.</TE>
<TE>   The Apple fire, about 21 miles east of Glide, was expected to
continue growing to the east and eventually merge with the Tiller
Complex, which was 45% contained after burning 56,900 acres. Fire
managers closed three campgrounds, the Umpqua Trail and parts of the
North Umpqua River. Oregon Highway 138 was closed from Steamboat to
Dry Creek. The cause was under investigation.</TE>

<HD>Family Friend Held in Rape and Beating of Utah Girl, 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>An 11-year-old girl was kidnapped from her bedroom Monday by a man
who raped and beat her in her backyard before he was captured, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   Javier Sickler, a former high school classmate of the girl's
father, was arrested after officers found him attacking the girl in
suburban Midvale, police Sgt. John Salazar said.</LD>
<LD>   The girl, who police said was probably beaten with a hammer, was
in critical condition.</LD>
<TE>   Salazar said he didn't know of any connection between Sickler and
14-year-old Elizabeth A. Smart, who was abducted in June from a
bedroom she shared with her 9-year-old sister in their Salt Lake City
home. Elizabeth has not been found.</TE>
<TE>   Sickler told police he remembered banging on the door of the
victim's house and nothing else, according to Salazar.</TE>
<TE>   "He's claiming he had a blackout," Salazar said. Police said
Sickler, 28, and the girl's father had renewed their friendship in
the last few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said the attacker slipped into the home through an
unlocked side door and went into the bedroom the girl shares with her
10-year-old brother. Police said the intruder asked the boy where his
father slept, then kidnapped the girl.</TE>
<TE>   The boy didn't feel threatened, and there was no indication of a
struggle, Salazar said. The children's father and their grandparents
were asleep in the home.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, a neighbor called police and reported hearing
moaning outside. Salazar said two officers found a man beating the
girl with a blunt object, likely a hammer.</TE>
<TE>   The man ran toward his car until a police dog stopped him, police
said.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Faulted for Disaster Plan on 9/11</HD>
<DH>Terror: Organizational failures hindered the response of
the city's police and firefighters, report says. A lack of
communication was key.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Nearly a year after the attacks on the World Trade Center, a
comprehensive report concluded Monday that police and firefighters
were hampered by numerous communications and organizational failures
during their response to the disaster--emergency preparedness
shortcomings that New York and cities across the country are trying
to address.</LD>
<LD>   Two studies, one on New York's firefighters and the other on
police, found that both lacked a comprehensive plan for such a large
catastrophe and rarely exchanged information or coordinated their
actions as the terrorism unfolded.</LD>
<LD>   Communications from commanders to firefighters desperately trying
to rescue people trapped in the cavernous skyscrapers was sporadic
and hampered by major radio system failures.</LD>
<TE>   The report also found that many firefighters and their chiefs who
gathered in the lobby of the north tower initially believed only a
part of the south tower had collapsed when in reality the entire
110-story structure had crashed to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Fire chiefs in the lobbies of both towers had little reliable
information about the status of the firefighters they sent up into
the buildings, and they did not receive badly needed intelligence
from a police helicopter hovering above the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Chief officers considered a limited, localized collapse of the
towers possible, but did not think they would collapse entirely," the
report by the management consultant McKinsey &amp; Co. said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack cost the lives of 343 firefighters and 23 members of
the Police Department. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
which operated the trade center complex, lost 37 officers.</TE>
<TE>   The study, which included hundreds of interviews, analysis of
radio communications and key documents, praised the "enormous
heroism" of the rescue personnel and included numerous
recommendations for change.</TE>
<TE>   "It is particularly crucial and urgent to improve the coordination
between the FDNY and the NYPD," the study urged, praising "positive
first steps" that Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and Fire
Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta have taken to improve relations
between their departments.</TE>
<TE>   But it warned: "More needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Cities and states around the country have reevaluated emergency
procedures and purchased new equipment, including mobile command
centers, since the trade center attack.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, officials are preparing to unveil a radio system to
improve communication among law enforcement agencies. Authorities in
Idaho have practiced responding to bioterrorism using volunteers who
played victims. St. Louis set up a special commission to help craft a
communications system to replace one that includes 30 radio
frequencies.</TE>
<TE>   Boston recently increased its public safety budget by
$745,000--much of the money designated for anti-terrorism measures,
including 24-hour patrols at a key reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore police purchased a new mobile command post, while in
Greenville, S.C., emergency management officials are lobbying for
high-tech radios and better training for police, firefighters and
paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management recently
updated its terrorism response plan. But like New York and some other
cities, communications remains a concern.</TE>
<TE>   "In New York, there is one police department, one health
department and one fire department, and even with just that, they had
difficulty," said Capt. Michael Grossman of the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department. "Here, we have 88 cities."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles sheriff's officials are studying how to improve
communications among agencies in case of an attack or other disaster,
but are at least a year away from issuing a report, Grossman said.</TE>
<TE>   Additional training exercises also are planned. They include a
countywide drill in November with mock "dirty" bombs hitting several
targets at once. Hundreds of firefighters and police are expected to
participate.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the McKinsey report concluded with a statement that
experts said applied not only to that city but also to efforts in
other areas of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "To truly improve New York's preparedness, the city or state must
establish an enhanced coordination process that encourages government
agencies to plan and execute their response to major incidents
together.</TE>
<TE>   "This coordination would give decision makers a comprehensive view
of the capabilities and responsibilities of all relevant agencies,"
the study said.</TE>
<TE>   New York's five-month analysis ordered by Police and Fire
Department officials found a "lack of equipment, training and
supervision" among the hundreds of people who searched for survivors
after both towers collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   In the first moments of the crisis, top police commanders were
unclear how to obtain military air support to defend against
additional attacks, the report noted.</TE>
<TE>   It took weeks for some hazardous materials to be identified,
posing extra risks to workers.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency plans called for coverage of an unrealistic number of
sensitive locations in the city, and only 13% of these potential
targets received additional police protection in the immediate hours
after terrorists struck, the report also concluded.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, at a City Hall news conference, Scoppetta and Kelly
pledged better planning and further cooperation and outlined steps
they have already taken.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised both departments for carrying
out "the most successful urban rescue in modern history," but added a
crucial caveat. "There is no doubt in my mind that we are doing today
what the heroes of 9/11 would have wanted us to," he said of the
post-crisis analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The report painted a portrait of some well-intentioned police and
firefighters proceeding directly to the twin towers instead of to
staging areas where they could be systematically assigned to the
crisis. Some off-duty rescuers arrived without radios, which further
complicated the situation.</TE>
<TE>   It said ambulance dispatchers were overwhelmed trying to handle an
enormous volume of calls under extreme pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department managed to maintain coverage in the rest of
the city, but it would have been unable to respond quickly and
effectively to another major incident involving hazardous materials.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDNY has just one hazmat unit, which was committed to the
World Trade Center," said the report, which urged expanded hazardous
material capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   It recommended replacing the current emergency tracking system: a
metal board with small magnets to indicate unit locations.</TE>
<TE>   The study called for creation of management teams of Fire
Department experts to respond to major incidents and to modernize
procedures to quickly mobilize off-duty firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   It also urged the Fire Department to distribute better radios and
specialized gear to improve communications in high-rises.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the police should ensure that there is a single
top commander. It also proposed more frequent large-scale drills and
terrorism simulations.</TE>
<TE>   Scoppetta and Kelly stressed that some of the recommendations,
including better communication between their departments, already had
been implemented.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are clearly better prepared," the mayor added, citing
the heroism of police and firefighters "... The number of things that
went right vastly outnumbered what we would do differently."</TE>

<HD>Suit Seeks to Halt U.S. Oil Search at Colo. Monument</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Four environmental groups announced Monday that they have filed suit
to stop vibrating trucks from exploring for oil at the Canyons of the
Ancients National Monument.</LD>
<LD>   The federal suit alleges the Bureau of Land Management is
violating the proclamation that established the national monument by
allowing exploration in an area that has not previously been leased
to energy companies.</LD>
<LD>   The filing also claims that the trucks will needlessly scar the
land, which is next to an area surveyed for oil in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just a gratuitous trashing of the same area," said Jay
Tutchton, director of the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic,
which is representing the groups.</TE>
<TE>   Those filing the lawsuit are the San Juan Citizens Alliance, the
Wilderness Society, the Colorado Environmental Coalition and the Oil
and Gas Accountability Project.</TE>
<TE>   Under the project, expected to begin next week, four trucks will
drive through the area and periodically stop to lower a vibrating
plate to the ground to help determine where oil might be found.</TE>
<TE>   The proclamation that created the 164,000-acre preserve of ancient
Indian culture barred oil and gas exploration where there are no
existing leases. Opponents say federal mineral lease maps show that
about 20% of the land to be surveyed has never been leased.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has listed opening more public land to oil
and gas development as part of a national energy plan intended to
increase domestic production.</TE>

<HD>Tapes Seen as Poison 'Proof'</HD>
<DH>Terror: The footage on CNN is graphic confirmation that Al
Qaeda experimented with chemical weapons, the U.S. says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A new cache of videotapes showing the apparent training of Al Qaeda
operatives in Afghan terrorist camps offers graphic confirmation of
the long-held belief that Osama bin Laden's network has experimented
with chemical weapons, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 64 tapes, obtained by CNN in Afghanistan and airing through
the week on the cable network, appear to show terrorist camp trainees
using poison gas to kill dogs and undergoing other training in
explosives and terror tactics.</LD>
<LD>   CNN said the tapes were obtained by one of the network's reporters
in Afghanistan from a secret location and that they appear to
represent Al Qaeda's "video library" on terrorist tactics, dating to
the late 1980s. The most recent footage shows Al Qaeda members
watching television clips of the Sept. 11 attacks as they unfolded.</LD>
<TE>   The tapes, believed to be the largest collection assembled on the
workings of Al Qaeda, suggest that Bin Laden's network went to great
lengths to document and catalog its training methods and to pass them
on to new generations of "jihad" warriors.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, with President Bush near
Crawford, Texas, said the tapes are "a serious reminder of the type
of enemy we're up against.... People who use weapons to bring harm to
innocents. This is a vivid illustration of what terrorism means."</TE>
<TE>   The network received only about 75 complaints concerning the video
of the dogs being poisoned, CNN officials said.</TE>
<TE>   CNN has already turned some of the tapes over to the State
Department and the Pentagon, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said intelligence and counter-terrorism experts
will study the tapes to verify their authenticity and to glean any
new information on Al Qaeda's methods, but they downplayed their
potential significance.</TE>
<TE>   "The videotapes are proof of what we have known to be the case for
some time," said a U.S. official who asked not to be identified. "The
idea that Al Qaeda was testing [chemical weapons] comes as absolutely
no surprise. It's been known for years. And what is portrayed on the
videotapes, even if it's legitimate, doesn't mean they have the
capability to inflict mass casualties on humans."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, CIA Director George J. Tenet spoke publicly in early 2000,
18 months before the Sept. 11 attacks, of Bin Laden's "strong
interest in chemical weapons," saying that the Saudi exile was
believed to have trained his operatives in the use of toxic chemicals
and biological toxins.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials have since learned more about Bin Laden's
interest in chemical weapons from Al Qaeda training manuals and from
former Al Qaeda members such as Ahmed Ressam, the terrorist caught
near Seattle in December 2000 in a foiled plot to bomb Los Angeles
International Airport and sentenced to 140 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Times disclosed in September that Ressam gave government
interrogators a slew of previously undisclosed details about the
tools and techniques he learned in Bin Laden's terrorist camps,
including the mixing of crude but often lethal chemical compounds
that can be applied on doorknobs or through ventilation systems.</TE>
<TE>   CNN said the poison used by Al Qaeda operatives to kill dogs in a
videotaped experiment may be sarin, the same deadly chemical used in
a 1995 attack on a Japanese subway. In addition, footage to be aired
later in the week shows training in weapons, explosives, urban
assassination and combat, hostage taking and other terrorist tactics,
the network said.</TE>
<TE>   The collection also included a documentary that was critical of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, CNN officials said. In one tape, Bin
Laden appeared to refer to Hussein as a "bad Muslim," although the
context of the remark was unclear, the network said.</TE>
<TE>   Such criticism, suggesting a divide between Bin Laden and Hussein,
could run counter to efforts by the United States to link Hussein to
Bin Laden and other terrorist groups as it considers a possible
military strike.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said that although the
department cannot yet vouch for the authenticity of the tapes, it
welcomes the chance to review them. "Certainly, no one should be
surprised at what the tapes purport to reflect--that is, terrorist
training techniques that seem to be shown on these tapes," Reeker
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda is well-known for its brutal terrorist tactics and has
trained thousands of members to murder innocent people in a variety
of ways. All of us know that all too well as we approach the first
anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks upon our country.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, the videotapes appear to be indicative of the lethal
threat posed by the Al Qaeda network," Reeker added. "They underscore
the need for continued international cooperation to arrest Al Qaeda
operatives wherever they are found, to dry up terrorist financing and
to remain vigilant for possible future attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Teya Ryan, executive vice president at CNN, said the network paid
"a nominal amount" for the tapes, which reporter Nic Robertson
learned about from a longtime source not connected with Al Qaeda. CNN
executives said the payment did not go to that source. They declined
to discuss where the money went, except to say that it was not to
anyone affiliated with Al Qaeda.</TE>

<HD>Lava-Mad Tourists Go With the Flow in Hawaii</HD>
<DH>Nature: Thousands are drawn to the volcano's latest output.
A nearby road is now covered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VOLCANO, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>Lava from Kilauea Volcano has covered one of the last remaining
isolated sections of road that had been untouched by previous flows.</LD>
<LD>   Previous lava flows covered Chain of Craters Road along the ocean
to the east and west, leaving one section untouched. The section of
road is less than a mile long.</LD>
<LD>   But at 8:20 a.m. Sunday, lava touched the road and by 11:10 a.m.
had covered the section as it continued its flow to the sea, said
David Jordan, a photographer who was one of three people who viewed
the lava crossing.</LD>
<TE>   The lava then went down a set of steps that pedestrians once used
to view the lava at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a lava bench--an area of new, unstable land created by
cooled lava--collapsed into the ocean, sending a large steam cloud
into the air.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard it, turned around and saw a giant plume in the air,"
Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than two dozen visitors were out hiking around the lava
flows early Sunday, but by midday a line of cars had started to build
up at park entrances.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials have said that about 3,000 to 4,000 people have
visited each day in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   This latest eruption has been drawing tourists since Mother's Day,
but it has received increased attention since the lava crossed the
Chain of Craters Road at the end of last month, giving viewers an
up-close look.</TE>
<TE>   Park rangers warn of the dangers of sulfuric fumes, unstable lava
and scalding water sprays where lava enters the ocean. The rangers
say medics have treated numerous visitors who have tripped or fallen
on jagged, hardened lava.</TE>
<TE>   Lava has been pouring out of Kilauea for more than 19 years, but
usually at a slower pace.</TE>
<TE>   The lava is creating new black sand beaches along the Big Island's
southeastern shore and extending the national park by several acres
each week. The latest massive breakout of lava began on Mother's Day,
May 12, and reached the ocean in late July.</TE>

<HD>Everyone's Awaiting the Clippers' Moves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not much noise coming out of Clipper country these days. It feels
like we're on a bird-watching expedition, patiently sitting in hopes
of spotting a rare spotty-beaked blue warbler, as we await that
unheard-of noise, Donald Sterling's pen scribbling across a
commitment to a big-money contract.</LD>
<LD>   Any or all of the following could be signed to a contract
extension this summer: Elton Brand, Michael Olowokandi, Lamar Odom
and Andre Miller. So far, the total is zero.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, there is news of big contracts around the league--and
Clipper players notice.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't help but see guys like BD [Baron Davis] and Shawn Marion,
talented players, signing for the max and things like that," Brand
said.</TE>
<TE>   If the New Orleans Hornets can sign Baron Davis for $84 million
when he wasn't even sure he wanted to stay there, if the Phoenix Suns
can sign Shawn Marion for $79 million, then the Clippers can "max
out" Brand--or at least come close.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Kings signed point guard Mike Bibby to a seven-year,
$80.5-million contract last week, it had ramifications for the
Clippers. Actually, it included one bit of good news for them. David
Falk, who represents Bibby and Brand, didn't hold the Kings up for a
"max" contract. Bibby will start at $8.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   So Falk is acknowledging that the marketplace isn't quite like it
was during the free-spending summer of 1996. And I'm hearing that
Falk is even allowing the Clippers a little wiggle room in their
negotiations with Brand. Now don't think he's turned into Mr. Softy.
He still turned down a $70-million offer from the Kings and squeezed
an extra $10.5 million out of them.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news for the Clippers? Olowokandi was selected ahead of
Bibby with the No. 1 overall pick in 1998 and his agent sees Bibby's
contract as a starting point for his client's new deal.</TE>
<TE>   "A baseline," is what Bill Duffy called it. He also said there had
been no talks about Olowokandi's contract for several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Miller will expect the same kind of numbers as Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Miller averaged more points than Bibby (16.5 to 13.7) and more
than twice as many assists (10.9 to 5.0 ) last season. Of course,
Bibby jacked up his price during the playoffs. He was the definition
of a money player, coming through with clutch shots against the
Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   What the Clippers are paying Miller for, what made them willing to
bet the talent of Darius Miles and risk the wrath of fans to obtain
him, is the promise of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   If the Clippers are that confident they'll make the playoffs, then
they should start spending as if they can expect the extra revenue
that comes from home playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   Brand is the logical first step. Miller probably wants to wait
until next year's "seller's" free-agent market, Odom is coming off an
injury-filled and suspension-plagued season, and Olowokandi still
represents a bet on potential, as he was when the Clippers made him
the No. 1 draft pick four years ago. Olowokandi also might want to
seek another season of better numbers and then a better market, when
more teams will be under the salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Brand is the safest investment, with averages of 19.4 points and
10.6 rebounds in his first three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Brand led the Clippers in scoring, was fifth in the league in
rebounds and tops in offensive rebounds last season. He ranked third
in the NBA last season with 55 double-doubles. That's 12 behind
league-leader Tim Duncan, four behind Kevin Garnett and 12 more than
the fifth-place guy--Marion.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the holdup? For one thing, Falk was on vacation for
three weeks. After he returned he focused on Bibby's contract, while
Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor was visiting Chick Hearn in the
hospital, then mourning Hearn's death.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing that says the Clippers have to sign any of these
guys this summer. They can put this off until next year, if they want
to take their chances. But if they can lock up even one guy, it will
stand as a signal to the rest of them that they want to keep this
team together.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, they're going against their track record that says they
absolutely won't.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, that history is a little deceiving. If you consider some
of the free agents who departed over the years--Ron Harper, Loy
Vaught, Rodney Rogers, Bo Outlaw, Maurice Taylor, Isaac Austin and
even Derek Anderson--none went on to greater individual glory. Yes,
Harper won five championships with the Lakers and Chicago Bulls, but
he wasn't in a starring role.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Anderson, the Clippers wouldn't be any
better off with the ex-Clippers than the guys they have now.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's the reputation the Clippers have working against them,
and it definitely creeps into Brand's mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to allow [it], but it's what happened in the past,"
Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't seem like anybody's signed yet. We have to wait and
see what happens. It's the waiting period."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the Clippers and money, waiting isn't just the
hardest part. It's all they ever seem to do.</TE>
<TE>   When I mentioned all the contract work to Clipper Vice President
Andy Roeser the day the team introduced Miller, Roeser confidently
said, "We'll get it done."</TE>
<TE>   We'll see about that.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Lima gave up one run in seven strong innings Monday night and
the Tigers held on to beat the Seattle Mariners, 4-3, at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit beat the Mariners for the first time this season as
Seattle lost for the third time in four games and fell two percentage
points behind the idle Angels, who moved into first place in the
American League West.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing, 4-1, in the ninth, the Mariners scored two runs off
closer Juan Acevedo. Ichiro Suzuki hit a one-out RBI single and
scored with two out on Tiger shortstop Shane Halter's throwing error.
Bret Boone then hit a sinking liner to right, but Robert Fick made a
tumbling catch to end the game.</LD>
<TE>   Seattle had three consecutive singles in the fifth, but failed to
score. Suzuki was thrown out stealing and Mark McLemore was thrown
out trying to go from first to third on John Olerud's single. Bobby
Higginson chased down the ball in left-center and threw out McLemore
by about 10 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle outfielder Ruben Sierra later left the game with a
strained left quadriceps.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 8, Cleveland 1--Tim Hudson pitched 8 1/3 innings to remain
unbeaten in August and Eric Chavez homered twice at Cleveland as the
Athletics won their sixth in a row and moved to within one game of
first in the AL West. Hudson (10-9) is 3-0 with a 1.21 earned-run
average this month. Jim Thome hit his 38th homer for the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 7, Chicago 3--Jacque Jones hit two of the Twins' five
homers and Brad Radke got his first win since May 8 to highlight
Minnesota's victory at Chicago. Jones and Cristian Guzman hit
back-to-back homers to start the game.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Kansas City 0--Pete Walker pitched two-hit ball for
seven innings and the Blue Jays won at Toronto to stop a five-game
losing streak. Shannon Stewart homered, scored twice and made an
over-the-shoulder catch at the left-field wall.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 7, Baltimore 3--The Devil Rays hit a club-record three
homers in a seven-run second inning at Baltimore and Paul Wilson beat
the Orioles for the fourth time this season.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Percival Plays It Cool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball players are a notoriously superstitious bunch. So it was no
real surprise that Angel closer Troy Percival, who has been as
dominant lately as he has been at any time in his career, stared
straight ahead, broke into a sheepish grin and said, "I'm pitching
OK," when asked by a group of reporters to discuss his recent run.</LD>
<LD>   Seconds later, he blinked, turned the questioning around and
looked up from his stool.</LD>
<LD>   "What," he asked the gathering, "are you trying to put the kibosh
on me?"</LD>
<TE>   Though Percival was half-joking, his pitching has been anything
but a joke to opposing hitters.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, who has six saves in August with an 0.96 earned-run
average, saved three of the Angels' five victories on their recent
5-1 home stand against Detroit and Cleveland, giving him 30 saves. It
is the fifth consecutive year he has saved at least 30 games and the
sixth time in his eight-year career.</TE>
<TE>   He had three saves as a rookie in 1995, when he served as Lee
Smith's understudy, and 27 in 1997, when he spent 40 days on the
disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Percival already has had two stints on the disabled list this
season, though neither was related to his right (pitching) arm.</TE>
<TE>   In Friday night's 5-4 victory over the Indians, a team that has
dealt Percival eight of his 30 losses, Percival struck out the side
with overpowering fastballs to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night, he finished off the Indians on eight pitches,
hitting 97 mph on the radar gun three times.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Percy's shown that his stuff is as good as it's ever
been," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "I know our goal is to have him
maintain that and he's shown that he's been able to. He's shown he
can maintain it for not only consecutive nights but over the course
of a whole season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' trip to New York will be the team's first since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and Scioscia anticipates a moving visit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're approaching the one-year anniversary and it's going to be a
very emotional time," he said. "It's going to be an emotional
experience for whoever gets the opportunity to [visit ground zero]. I
haven't decided if I am or not. I don't know if our schedule is going
to really permit it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's emotional and I think it's going to be that way for a long
[time] to come. It's a tragedy that transcends, I think, a lot of
things that people have experienced in this country as far as our
generation."</TE>
<TE>   As far as playing the Yankees, who probably would be a first-round
opponent if the Angels win the American League wild card, and the
Boston Red Sox, who are chasing the Angels for the wild-card spot,
Scioscia said his team would approach each game one at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these guys have a lot of confidence," he said. "This
group of guys has taken that East Coast trip and we've played well in
the past there. Why? I don't know? I don't think there's any reason
why."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' .524 winning percentage (11-10) against the Yankees
since Scioscia took over is the second-best regular-season mark in
the AL from opening day 2000 through Sunday. Only Seattle's .607
percentage (17-11) is better.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Ramon Ortiz has been pitching with a heavy heart.
With the health of his 77-year-old father, Alfonso Urena, failing in
his hometown of Cotui, Dominican Republic, Ortiz has had a tough time
focusing.</TE>
<TE>   "Some days he's fine and others he needs help breathing," Ortiz
said. "I don't know if I have to go home.</TE>
<TE>   "Your mother and father are the most important thing in your
life."</TE>

<HD>Fans Aren't Ready to Strike Back Yet</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They may express their anger about possibility of
a players' strike in other ways, but major league attendance numbers
show little effect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A nation of angry baseball fans has made its voice heard.</LD>
<LD>   With the threat of an imminent work stoppage, the sporting public
has lashed out on radio talk shows and the Internet, in letters to
the editor and signs draped over ballpark railings. Critics have
proposed everything from a silent protest in the stands to an
immediate and outright boycott.</LD>
<LD>   But in the language that speaks loudest to owners and players--the
language of attendance and television ratings--all this talk has so
far amounted to hot air.</LD>
<TE>   Last weekend, in the 48 hours after the players' union set a
strike date of Aug. 30, major league games attracted a healthy
average of 31,540 fans, and at least two teams drew unusually large
crowds, apparently overcoming moral indignation with the offer of
free bobblehead dolls.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for the Fox network's game of the week were similarly up
4%.</TE>
<TE>   "It disappoints me quite a bit," said Greg Caldwell, a Houston
public relations manager who recently formed the Baseball Fan Union,
one of numerous organizations and Web sites that have sprung up with
the aim of mounting a grass-roots revolt.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times do the fans have to see this take place?" Caldwell
asked. "The owners and players don't care about them, yet they
continue to support baseball. The owners know that and the players
know that, and that's why they didn't hesitate to set a strike date."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators met again Monday, their second set of talks since the
strike date was announced. Representatives from the two sides said
they did not address the difficult issues of a luxury tax and revenue
sharing, focusing instead on "legal, drafting-type issues."</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of any encouraging news, Caldwell had figured the
fan movement was gaining momentum as his Web site received more than
45,000 hits in recent weeks. He was similarly heartened by the words
of President Bush last week. If play is halted, Bush said, "a lot of
fans are going to be furious, and I'm one of them."</TE>
<TE>   But a far different sentiment was expressed by San Francisco Giant
outfielder Barry Bonds, who seemed confident the game could survive
what would be its ninth work stoppage since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "It will come back," he told the Washington Post. "A lot of
companies go on strike, not just baseball. And people still ride the
bus."</TE>
<TE>   Though attendance at baseball games is down 5.3% this season, the
numbers from last Saturday and Sunday appear to support his
contention.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Phillies attracted a season-high crowd of 58,493
for a home game against the St. Louis Cardinals at which fans
received a dual bobblehead doll of Hall of Fame announcer Harry Kalas
and Hall of Fame player Richie Ashburn. The Montreal Expos, among the
worst-drawing teams in the league, had a respectable 24,872
attendance for a game against the San Diego Padres that featured
Vladimir Guerrero dolls.</TE>
<TE>   Leaguewide, the two-day average of 31,540 was significantly better
than the 30,555 that baseball drew the weekend of Aug. 3 and 4. It
fell short of the 35,937 mark set Aug. 10-11, but that weekend
featured Bonds as a new member of the 600 home run club, Chicago Cub
outfielder Sammy Sosa playing two highlight-reel games in Denver and
the New York Yankees drawing 54,000-plus fans to each of two home
games against the Oakland Athletics. Attendance the weekend of July
27-28, when many of the teams that were home Aug. 10-11 also hosted
games, was a nearly identical 35,939.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, last weekend's numbers remained strong even though
the Yankees were on the road and the Giants, leading the National
League in attendance, played against the Florida Marlins in moribund
Pro Player Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans talk a big game, but for 30 years they've never really
backed it up," said David Carter of the Sports Business Group, a Los
Angeles-based consulting firm. "They've had a chance to be part of
the solution, but they've been part of the problem because they
haven't put their money where their mouth is."</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the Angels averaged 40,760 for a three-game series
against the Cleveland Indians, including 6,080 walk-up fans Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a new Web site called MLBfanstrike.com was pushing for
an immediate boycott and urging season-ticket holders to demand a
refund.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the strong attendance numbers, Caldwell hopes that such
efforts will catch the attention of owners and players.</TE>
<TE>   "My e-mail box is inundated with people telling me that if the
players do strike, they're done with baseball," he said. "They're not
coming back. People are really fed up. That's what I'm hearing."</TE>

<HD>Rivera Goes On Disabled List</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Yankee closer Mariano Rivera was put on the 15-day disabled
list for the third time this season after an MRI exam on Monday
showed he had again strained his right shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   The move was made retroactive to Aug. 16. Rivera will follow a
program of rest and exercise--but no throwing--for now.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera is 1-4 with 27 saves and a 2.85 earned-run average. Before
this year, Rivera had been on the disabled list only once in his
career.</LD>
<TE>   Rivera was sidelined from June 10-25 because of a strained right
groin. He went back on the disabled list on July 26 because of a
strain in his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland infielder Ricky Gutierrez went on the 15-day disabled
list because of a strained neck. The Indians signed the 32-year-old
to a three-year, $11.5-million free-agent deal on Dec. 1.... The
Texas Rangers recalled left-hander C.J. Nitkowski. He became the
club-record 26th pitcher this season.</TE>

<HD>Brees Replaces Flutie as Charger Starter</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after San Diego Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer called his
team's quarterback race a virtual dead heat, Drew Brees supplanted
39-year-old Doug Flutie on Monday as the starting quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   Brees, 23, a second-round pick in 2001, appeared in only one game
last season as the backup to Flutie, who started 16 games and threw
for 3,464 yards--his NFL career high.</LD>
<LD>   "What I ultimately arrived at was that Drew is going to get better
with every snap that he plays," Schottenheimer said. "Now that's not
to say that every snap is going to be a good snap, but he's going to
get better every snap he plays.... With regard to Doug, my sense was
that if a guy is going to come off the bench, who was better to do
that? I thought clearly it was Doug. You can't prepare for that and
his ability as a playmaker and the magic he brings to a football
team."</LD>
<TE>   Brees, a three-year starter at Purdue, said he and Flutie have
maintained a good relationship throughout the competition and spoke
Monday about the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We both understand the situation," Brees said. "Obviously, I'm
sure Doug is disappointed but there was one guy who was going to be
the starter and one guy who was going to be the backup. I know how
hard he's worked for this."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how it will benefit him having Flutie help him from the
sideline, Brees said: "That's going to be a huge advantage because
he's seen it all and done it all. I know there are things he sees and
I don't."</TE>
<TE>   Flutie, whose quarterback competition with Rob Johnson in Buffalo
turned toxic, said all the right things this time.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew Brees is going to do nothing but get better," he said.
"Right now he's solid, and he can get the job done. Six weeks from
now, he's going to be better."</TE>

<LD>The University of Oregon isn't the only Pacific 10 Conference school
spending thousands of dollars on billboards in New York and Los
Angeles to promote its football program.</LD>
<LD>   Washington State also has gotten into the act, though the Cougars
are spending considerably less than the Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon, after all, paid $250,000 for a billboard of receiver
Keenan Howry in Times Square in one of its promotions. The Ducks
spent another $40,000 for a billboard of three receivers in downtown
L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Washington State's answer? A giant photo of quarterback Jason
Gesser has been placed on the side of a grain elevator in Dusty,
Wash., population 10. The 25 x 15-foot banner reads: "Gess Who 4
Heisman? Jason Gesser."</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only male golfer to have won both the U.S.
Public Links and U.S. Amateur championships?</TE>
<TE>   Cheap: When the St. Louis Browns played their final game in 1953
before becoming the Baltimore Orioles, a 2-1 loss in 12 innings to
the Chicago White Sox, the home team ran out of fresh baseballs and
the last out was recorded with a recycled ball with a gash in it.</TE>
<TE>   Leaping Larry: Outfielder Larry Walker of the Colorado Rockies,
after reaching above the right-field fence to take an apparent home
run away from Florida's Andy Fox, said, "I'm from Canada, and we're
known for basketball. My vertical skills got me six feet off the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Self analysis: After seeing his batting average drop into the
.230s, Chicago White Sox slugger Frank Thomas offered this
observation:</TE>
<TE>   "All I need is a hundred hits over the next three weeks and I'll
be fine."</TE>
<TE>   You can look it up: When the Texas Rangers' Travis Hafner homered
last week, he became the fifth native of North Dakota to hit a home
run in a major league game.</TE>
<TE>   Another win: When it was goalie Dominik Hasek's turn to take
temporary custody of the Stanley Cup, he used it to raise money for
flood victims in his native Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Along with fellow Detroit Red Wing players Jiri Fischer, Jiri
Slegr and Ladislav Kohn, Hasek paraded the Stanley Cup at a number of
fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Stanley Cup will be leaving proudly," said Hasek, who is
retiring after winning the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie six
times. "It has contributed to a good deed."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this date in 1974, the Angels' Nolan Ryan struck
out 19 Tigers in a 1-0, 11-inning loss to Detroit. It was the third
time that season that Ryan struck out 19 batters in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Billy Mayfair, 1986 Public Links and 1987 Amateur.
He turned pro in '88.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "In
every golf club tournament there is a closest-to-hole competition.
For pitchers who face Barry Bonds there should be a
furthest-from-strike-zone competition. Winner gets a plucked chicken.</TE>
<TE>   "Bonds gets walked more often than a dog with a digestive problem.
Take last weekend's three-game action. Bonds comes to bat 14 times,
is walked seven times. Sammy Sosa comes to bat 13 times, is walked
once."</TE>

<HD>Grissom Happier and Producing</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: No longer griping about platooning, outfielder has
excelled and even assumed an everyday role after Jordan's injury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger outfielder Marquis Grissom was bitter last season, which is
understandable. Most players would grumble about having to platoon
with Tom Goodwin, a center fielder with so few big league tools the
Dodgers didn't even flinch when they released him ast spring,
swallowing his $3.75-million contract.</LD>
<LD>   But instead of stewing all winter and fretting about another
probable platoon in 2002, Grissom, a 13-year veteran who won a World
Series championship with Atlanta in 1995, returned to his farm in
rural Georgia and drove a wedge between himself and the game wide
enough to drive his tractor through.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't do [anything] at home, and that was the difference last
winter," Grissom, 35, said. "That was my problem--too much thinking
about baseball, too much worrying about getting into shape. I was
already in shape, and I knew how to play baseball. So I worked on my
farm, went fishing and took care of my family. That's it."</LD>
<TE>   It was therapeutic. Grissom came to spring training with a clear
head, and from his first batting-practice swing in Vero Beach, Fla.,
to the two big hits and runs he provided in Sunday's 2-1 victory over
the New York Mets, he has been the consummate team player.</TE>
<TE>   No griping about sharing center field with Dave Roberts, who has
given the Dodgers the productive leadoff batter--at least against
right-handed starters--they have lacked for years. No criticizing the
manager for lineup decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The closest Grissom has come to being outspoken has been his
repeated desires to win and to be an everyday player, and what's
wrong with that? Manager Jim Tracy would expect nothing less.</TE>
<TE>   "Even at his age, he comes to the park [every day] thinking
there's something he can learn, an area he can improve in," Tracy
said. "He's accepted his role as professionally as a player can."</TE>
<TE>   That role, for the first four months, consisted of starting in
center field against left-handed pitchers, spelling Brian Jordan
occasionally in left field and pinch-hitting.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, who spent hours working in the cage with batting
instructor Jack Clark and coach Manny Mota to stay sharp, was solid
as a reserve, hitting .270 with 10 home runs and 38 runs batted in
through July.</TE>
<TE>   But Jordan's lower-back injury in early August thrust Grissom into
a more prominent role, and he has so excelled in it that Tracy has
had little choice but to keep playing Grissom, even at the expense of
Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom has started the last 10 games, eight in left field and two
in center, and is batting .381--16 for 42--with four home runs, nine
RBIs and 13 runs during that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who stumbled to an 8-17 record after the All-Star
break, won eight of the 10 games, increasing their lead over San
Francisco in the National League wild-card race to 3 1/2 games going
into tonight's series opener against the Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, batting .295 with 14 homers and 49 RBIs for the season,
tripled, doubled and scored the Dodgers' two runs in Sunday's win
over the Mets. His two-run homer in the eighth inning Friday turned a
2-1 deficit into a 3-2 victory over the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   His two-run single capped a five-run, seventh-inning rally that
gave the Dodgers a 10-8 win over the Phillies on Aug. 10, and his two
homers provided the first two runs of a 7-6 win over Philadelphia on
Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan returned Friday, after a six-game absence, but was back on
the bench--and not too happy about it--Saturday and Sunday, with
Tracy saying he "couldn't make a case for myself to remove Grissom
from the lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Could Grissom replace Jordan as the starter in left?</TE>
<TE>   "That's not my call," said Grissom, in the final year of a
five-year, $25-million contract. "I don't see it as me forcing the
manager to play me, or me being a fourth outfielder or a bench
player. If you put yourself in a position to succeed, you will have
success. Last year after the break, I thought I should have been
playing and wasn't. I've learned more about being part of a team this
year."</TE>
<TE>   A selfless approach has been more productive. Grissom hit .221
with 21 homers and 60 RBIs last season, and though his pigeon-toed
stance and Jimmy Wynn-like flicks of the bat in the box remain, he
hardly resembles the hitter he was in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom lacked discipline last season and had a .250 on-base
percentage with 107 strikeouts and only 16 walks in 448 at-bats. He
hit .243 with runners in scoring position, .321 when he put the first
pitch in play and .157 with two strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom is still aggressive, but more selective.</TE>
<TE>   He has a .337 on-base percentage, with 45 strikeouts and 16 walks
in 237 at-bats. He's hitting .314 with runners in scoring position,
.440 when he puts the first pitch into play and .235 with two
strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's more focused and a better player now than he was at any time
last year," Tracy said. "In whatever capacity he's been called upon,
he's been there."</TE>

<DL>SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Frank Flynn hit a three-run homer and struck out nine Monday to lead
Worcester, Mass. to a 6-0 victory over Fort Worth that clinched the
top seeding from Pool A at the Little League World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Worcester batted around and scored four runs in the third inning
when Flynn hit his 260-foot home run--the fence in left-center is 205
feet away--that made it 3-0.</LD>
<LD>   "If they throw a fastball anywhere over the plate, I'm going to
try to hit it somewhere where nobody's there," Flynn said.</LD>
<TE>   Said Worcester Manager Fran Granger: "When Frank hit that home
run, it was like a cloud was lifted and our bats just came alive."</TE>
<TE>   Zack Ford's RBI single made it 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Worcester and Fort Worth finished with 2-1 records, but Worcester
clinched the top spot in the pool with the win and by giving up only
four runs in pool play. Waipahu, Hawaii, also finished 2-1, but Fort
Worth won the tiebreaker for the second spot and a berth in a U.S.
semifinal Wednesday against Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Worcester added two runs in the fourth, the second on Keith
Landers' RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   In other games, Travis Jones hit a two-run homer in the bottom of
the sixth to help Waipahu defeat Webb City, Mo., 2-1. Reinius
Roosberg pitched a no-hitter for Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, which
defeated Moscow, 13-0 in four innings. Sendai, Japan, defeated
Monterrey, Mexico, 11-0, in four innings and Valencia, Venezuela,
defeated North Regina, Saskatchewan, 9-3.</TE>

<HD>Rose Bowl's NFL Player</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Moag helped broker league's return to
Baltimore and is confident he can bring team to Pasadena.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven years after paving the way for an NFL return to Baltimore, John
Moag is determined to bring pro football to the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Moag, chairman of a Maryland-based sports investment banking firm,
has been hired by Rose Bowl officials to assemble a realistic
financing plan and promote their stadium as a potential NFL site. The
hiring, which in many people's eyes elevates the Rose Bowl from
lightweight to legitimate player, was unanimously approved Monday
night in a vote by the Pasadena City Council.</LD>
<LD>   "Having somebody of John Moag's character on board really boosts
our effort," said Rose Bowl General Manager Darryl Dunn. "He gives us
the expertise that we need to be successful."</LD>
<TE>   Moag was chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority in 1995, when
Gov. Parris Glendening appointed him to find a replacement for the
Baltimore Colts, who'd left 11 years earlier. Moag helped broker the
deal that brought the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore a few months
later.</TE>
<TE>   That was essentially volunteer work for Moag, and--unless he lands
an NFL team--so is the Rose Bowl job. His firm will receive as much
as $5 million from Pasadena only if the city secures a commitment of
15 years or longer from an NFL franchise by Aug. 1, 2007.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not be devoting my or my company's resources to this if I
didn't view this as a highly viable project," Moag said..</TE>
<TE>   Moag is stepping into an L.A. picture that has been hopelessly
muddy since the Raiders and Rams left after the 1994 season. L.A.
almost landed an expansion franchise in 1999--a team that would have
played at the Coliseum--but was outbid by Houston billionaire Bob
McNair, who paid $700 million for his Houston Texans and next month
will watch them kick off their inaugural season.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a coalition of power brokers backed by Denver
billionaire Philip Anschutz proposed building a football stadium next
to Staples Center but pulled out in June for a number of reasons,
including stepped-up competition from the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Pasadena City Council unanimously approved a
three-year business plan submitted by the Rose Bowl Operating Co.
centered on attracting an NFL franchise. The stadium stands to lose
about $500,000 in annual revenue with next year's departure of Major
League Soccer's Galaxy, which is headed for the Anschutz sports
complex under construction in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena has invested $32 million over the last 10 years in
improvements at the 80-year-old Rose Bowl. The adjoining city-owned
Brookside golf course pays the bond debt for that renovation, which
is about $2.5 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl has hosted five Super Bowls and, when the Sept. 11
attacks forced the NFL to reschedule its championship game last
season, Pasadena emerged as the No. 1 alternate if New Orleans was
unable to accommodate the league. Securing Super Bowls is a vital
component for any group trying to bring the NFL back to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   To become NFL-ready, the Rose Bowl must clear a slew of
hurdles--among them the stadium's size (92,000 seats is far larger
than the NFL wants), historical-preservation issues, insufficient
freeway access and neighborhood concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Moag is convinced all those challenges are surmountable.</TE>
<TE>   "The obstacle here is money," he said, "not what this project
normally gets slammed for."</TE>
<TE>   Although Moag has only started to put together a financing model,
he understands public funds are essentially untouchable. Keeping the
facade of the Rose Bowl and building a new stadium inside would cost
between $300 million and $400 million, he said, and would be paid for
in large part by sales of luxury suites and club seats, as well as a
$150-million "G-3" loan granted to a relocating team. That's similar
to the proposed financing plan for the renovation of the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Moag said he visited the Rose Bowl for the first time in May and
immediately reevaluated his beliefs about the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "My perceptions of it were bad traffic, run down, nasty
neighbors," he said. "I came away from it with a 180-degree-different
view. The first thing that hit me was, wow, this is a gorgeous place.
What awesome potential this has."</TE>

<HD>Restarting the Talks Is Gradual Process</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After taking Sunday off, owners and players begin
with issues other than payroll tax and revenue sharing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Negotiators moved to regain momentum Monday in baseball labor talks
fast-approaching a deadline and sidetracked by last week's
contentious events, which included what sources called a verbal
outburst by union head Don Fehr.</LD>
<LD>   The sides, which did not meet Sunday, discussed ancillary matters
in an attempt to reestablish dialogue after the Major League Baseball
Players Assn. set an Aug. 30 strike deadline, and Fehr privately
blasted management for making what he considered an unacceptable tax
proposal in a session focusing on the core hurdle.</LD>
<LD>   Although players are scheduled to strike in 10 days, potentially
shutting down the sport for the ninth time in 30 years, owners and
the union apparently are playing it cool, hoping to maintain civility
entering the stretch run. The setting of the walkout date and Fehr's
frustration did not spur bargaining in a positive direction,
prompting negotiators to take a few steps back with the clock
ticking.</LD>
<TE>   "Whenever you have an event in the process, the setting of a
strike date, the actual strike, it causes a disruption to the
process," said Rob Manfred, baseball's lead labor lawyer. "You could
say that we went pretty hard, really, for two complete weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "You do get to the point where people just need a day to clear
their heads. That's really all we took."</TE>
<TE>   The cooling-off period occurs with management and the union
entrenched at opposite extremes on the payroll tax--a
salary-restraint tool that many owners deem essential to establish
competitive balance. Manfred has characterized the process with
optimism, but the mood changed last Wednesday when management
presented its latest tax proposal, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr was dismayed by management's counter to the union proposal,
expressing his feelings in a tension-filled conference room.</TE>
<TE>   Under the union offer, the minimum payroll subject to being taxed
would be $130 million in 2003, $140 million in 2004 and $150 million
in 2005, at which point the tax would end. The tax would be assessed
at a rate of 15% for clubs above the threshold once, 25% twice and
30% three times.</TE>
<TE>   Under the owners' proposal, a team would be taxed at 37.5% the
first time it exceeded the threshold, 42.5% the second time, 47.5%
the third time and 50% the fourth time. Management, also seeking to
have payroll based on 40-man instead of 25-man rosters, adopted the
union tax-rate formula, but increased the threshold only $4
million--to $102 million--from its starting figure.</TE>
<TE>   The minimal movement was greeted with anger by the union and Fehr,
in particular, sources said, because its bargaining team figured
hard-line owners were influencing the process, wasting time on a
proposal that wouldn't be taken seriously. Fehr does not discuss
specifics in talks, and Manfred responded to Wednesday's events by
saying, "I never said Don made an outburst, and I'm not going to
comment on whether it was disruptive."</TE>
<TE>   The sides are seemingly refocused after returning from their
corners, but much work remains to bridge the gap, even on issues
other than the payroll tax and increased revenue sharing, which, in
combination, the union views as a salary cap by another name. Loose
ends remain on steroid testing and a worldwide draft, which could
force the Dodgers to shut down their operation in the Dominican
Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations are expected to revert to the tax issue later this
week, but significant movement probably won't occur until shortly
before the strike date. Management and union sources remain hopeful
because the sides are prepared to make concessions on tax thresholds
and rates.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the last proposal on a luxury tax, and in terms of how
[that discussion] restarts, I'm just not going to speculate," Manfred
said. "How we return to the topic, I just can't tell you that right
now, but I want to be clear: If we're going to make an agreement,
everybody is going to have to have some wiggle room on this topic."</TE>

<LD>Olympic skier Jeremy Bloom decided Monday to give up his endorsement
deals and play football for Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Bloom, ninth in freestyle moguls at the Salt Lake City Games, had
hoped to keep his skiing sponsorship deals while playing for
Colorado, but NCAA rules prohibit endorsements by college athletes.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, a judge denied Bloom's request to bar the NCAA from
enforcing those rules.</LD>
<TE>   Bloom, who will be a freshman receiver, still hopes to ski in the
2006 Olympics. If he can find a way to finance skiing, the 5-foot-9,
165-pounder said he would like to start training after the regular
season, play in a bowl game, and then concentrate on skiing in the
spring.</TE>

<TE>   Shawn Kemp, the former NBA All-Star forward whose career has
crumbled because of weight and drug problems, is expected to be
waived today by the Portland Trail Blazers, according to a published
report.</TE>
<TE>   Kemp, 33, has reportedly agreed to forfeit more than $25 million
of the $46.5 million left on his contract, the Oregonian said in
today's editions.</TE>
<TE>   In the agreement, the Trail Blazers will pay Kemp about $20
million over more than 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kemp's agent could not be reached for comment. The Trail Blazers
also could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Kemp, who averaged 6.3 points in Portland, signed a seven-year,
$107-million contract in 1997 before he was traded from the Seattle
SuperSonics to the Cleveland Cavaliers, then traded to the Trail
Blazers before the 2000-01 season.</TE>

<HD>Denver Salutes Retiring Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bad knees did what opponents never could: stop Terrell Davis.</LD>
<LD>   During introductions for Monday night's exhibition game against
San Francisco, the Bronco running back walked through the tunnel in
uniform for the final time.</LD>
<LD>   To a standing ovation, he waved to the fans and was hugged by his
teammates, exchanging a long embrace with tight end Shannon Sharpe.
Then Davis retired to the sideline.</LD>
<TE>   Terrell Owens had seven catches for 123 yards as the 49ers beat
the Broncos, 12-7.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Broncos, at Davis' request, will put him on injured
reserve, ending his season and effectively ending the career of a
player who was both a Super Bowl and regular-season most valuable
player.</TE>
<TE>   Davis expected his farewell to be an emotional event.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mixed feelings," he said. "It's tough. My mind tells me
one thing, my knees say something else."</TE>
<TE>   A succession of knee injuries and surgeries since 1999--along with
degenerative arthritis in both joints--made Davis' decision
inevitable. Hopeful of a return to good health in 2002 after playing
in only 17 games the previous three seasons, Davis was unable to play
in the Broncos' opening exhibition game on Aug. 10, when he
experienced pain and swelling in his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was the Super Bowl MVP in 1998 then followed it with a
season when he became only the fourth back in NFL history to top
2,000 yards, gaining 2,008 to become the league's MVP for the 1998
season. He had 468 yards in three postseason games as the Broncos won
another Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   John Elway was Super Bowl MVP that year, but, as Sharpe said, "We
got two Super Bowl rings because of Terrell Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Davis retires with 7,607 rushing yards and 60 touchdowns, adding
1,140 and 12 touchdowns in the postseason. He had seven consecutive
100-yard rushing performances in the playoffs, an NFL record, and his
142.5-yard average in the postseason also is a league mark.</TE>
<TE>   Now the debate has begun over whether Davis belongs in the Pro
Football Hall of Fame. Critics say he didn't play long enough--only
four full seasons, seven in all. But he has better career statistics
than many runners already elected, including Gale Sayers, Leroy Kelly
and Hugh McElhenny.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two-time Pro-Bowl defensive lineman Sam Adams signed a multiyear
deal with the Oakland Raiders. Adams, who helped Baltimore win the
2001 Super Bowl after spending his first six NFL seasons with the
Seattle Seahawks, was released by the Ravens last spring in the
former champions' huge salary purge.... Seattle signed veteran
quarterback Mark Rypien to a one-year contract to help fill in for
the injured Trent Dilfer. Rypien, 39, practiced with the Seahawks for
the first time Monday morning at the team's training camp in Cheney,
near Spokane, where he lives.... Veteran quarterback Tony Banks
signed with the Houston Texans.</TE>

<HD>Hernandez Helps Giants Stop Skid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Livan Hernandez pitched a five-hitter for his first victory since
July 12 to help the faltering San Francisco Giants beat the Florida
Marlins, 3-0, at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants had lost four consecutive games, matching a season
high. They avoided their first four-game series sweep since July 4-7,
1996, at San Diego, and return home after a 2-4 trip.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants won without Barry Bonds, who was given the day off.</LD>
<TE>   David Bell doubled leading off the sixth for the Giants' first
hit, scored their first run and drove in another run with a sacrifice
fly. His run ended a streak of 20 1/3 scoreless innings for the
Giants. The Marlins had won four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Bell's bloop double deflected off the glove of a diving Preston
Wilson in short center to start the sixth. Bell advanced when
Hernandez sacrificed, then scored on Tom Goodwin's infield single off
the glove of second baseman Luis Castillo. Jeff Kent's two-out double
made it 2-0. J.T. Snow doubled in the seventh and later scored on
Bell's flyout.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 7, Colorado 6--Gary Sheffield and Chipper Jones hit
back-to-back homers to lead off the bottom of the ninth and rally the
Braves at Atlanta. Jones homered twice in the final two innings,
starting the eighth with a drive into the seats that launched a
three-run rally to tie the score, 5-5.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Cincinnati 5--Lance Berkman hit a two-run homer and
Wade Miller had an RBI single as he posted his eighth consecutive win
for the Astros at Cincinnati. Ken Griffey Jr. had a pinch-hit
three-run homer with no outs in the ninth before Billy Wagner got
three outs for his 28th save.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, San Diego 0--Bartolo Colon pitched a two-hitter for
his first National League shutout for the Expos at Montreal. Colon
(6-2) struck out six and walked two in his major league-leading
eighth complete game.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, Pittsburgh 2--Andy Benes gave up two hits in seven
scoreless innings and Albert Pujols drove in four runs at St. Louis
for the Cardinals, who have won nine of 10.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Lieberthal agreed to a $22.25-million three-year contract
extension with the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday. The deal includes
a $7.5-million club option for 2006.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old catcher is a two-time All-Star and has won a Gold
Glove. He is batting .292 with 14 homers and 46 runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   Lieberthal sat out most of last season because of a knee injury.
He is batting .391 with eight homers and 14 RBIs in his last 24
games.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida Marlin right-hander A.J. Burnett, who leads the majors
with five shutouts, went on the 15-day disabled list because of an
elbow bruise that could end his season. X-rays showed an acute bone
bruise in Burnett's pitching elbow, and an MRI confirmed that
diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   With the team out of the playoff race, Burnett, 25, won't be
rushed back into the rotation. Burnett, 12-9 with a 3.25 earned-run
average, is fourth in the majors with 183 strikeouts.</TE>

<HD>Oregon's $40,000 Billboard Hits Close to Home for USC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sight of three 40-foot Ducks in downtown Los Angeles has ruffled
the feathers of some territorial Trojans.</LD>
<LD>   In another sign that the power in Pacific 10 football now resides
in the Pacific Northwest, Oregon has erected a billboard depicting
Duck receivers Keenan Howry, Jason Willis and Samie Parker on the
north side of the 12-story Hotel Figueroa, a short jog from USC.</LD>
<LD>   The proximity of the 144-foot by 94-foot image to the campus of a
conference rival doesn't sit well with current and former Trojans.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel as if that's an insult," said senior receiver Kareem
Kelly. "When I saw it, I was shocked."</TE>
<TE>   Allan Graf, a guard on USC's 1972 national championship team, was
among several former players at Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage who
questioned Oregon's motives for putting up a billboard so close to
USC. Last year, Duck running back Maurice Morris was depicted on a
billboard adjacent to the 405 Freeway in Fox Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "If they have to come down to L.A. and start doing things like
that, I think it's pretty sad," said Graf, whose son Derek is a
reserve center for the Trojans. "You don't see us putting billboards
up in Eugene."</TE>
<TE>   Former tailback Anthony Davis, a member of the 1972 and '74
national champions, suggested USC should take action.</TE>
<TE>   "If our school lets them get away with it, I would question that,"
Davis said. "I saw the billboard on the 405 Freeway last year, but if
this one's in the middle of town and specifically down near the
campus, [Athletic Director] Mike Garrett and [USC] President Steven
Sample should call up there and say, 'Look, you need to cease on this
billboard in the middle of Trojantown.' "</TE>
<TE>   Garrett indicated he has no plans of making such a call. "They can
do anything they want," he said of Oregon. "It's a free world."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Graziano, marketing director at Oregon, said the university
spent $40,000 for the billboard, which is visible to the left while
driving south through downtown on the 110 Freeway. He said it will
stay up for three months.</TE>
<TE>   It is part of an ambitious marketing campaign launched by Oregon
in the last two years to increase the visibility of its football
team. The school spent $250,000 last year for a billboard of
quarterback Joey Harrington near Madison Square Garden in New York.
Returning to the Big Apple, Oregon this year spent $250,000 for a
billboard of Howry in Times Square and an additional $50,000 to have
Duck games televised, delayed, on the Yankees Entertainment &amp; Sports
(YES) Network.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not located in a media center, you go to the center,"
an Oregon official told the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   And the Ducks aren't stopping there. A billboard of Oregon running
back and Sacramento native Onterrio Smith is scheduled to go up this
week on the Bay Bridge--in the recruiting backyard of Stanford and
California--and Graziano said there are plans for a billboard
depicting Duck basketball players Luke Ridenour and Luke Jackson in
the Los Angeles area in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's marketing foray into Southern California isn't
surprising, considering that the Ducks depend heavily on recruits
from the area. All three wide receivers depicted on the billboard
hail from the Southland--Howry from Los Alamitos, Parker from Long
Beach and Willis from L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly it's about recruiting," Graziano said. "Whether we get
kids from L.A., or from San Francisco, or from our own state, we put
billboards where there are potential student-athletes."</TE>
<TE>   Said Davis: "Basically what they're saying is, 'We'll do better
for you than the University of Southern California.' I think that's
hitting real low."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Howell, a former All-American guard who played on USC's 1978
national championship team, said the downtown billboard should add to
the intensity of the Trojans' Oct. 26 game at Oregon. USC hasn't
beaten the Ducks since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had to drive by that every day, I couldn't wait for the game
to happen," Howell said. "They're encroaching on our territory.... If
anything, it's an incentive to go up there and [beat them]."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who ranks fifth on USC's all-time reception list, is
looking forward to the Oregon game for personal reasons. He's eager
to test his skills against Howry, a third-team All-American last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "When we play them, it's going to determine who's the best
receiver in the Pac-10," said Kelly, who knows Howry and was a
teammate of Parker's at Long Beach Poly High. "I can't wait to play
them."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin McKeever, a two-time All-American offensive end for USC in
1959-60, isn't worried about the Oregon billboard.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't going to hurt SC football, and it's going to cost them
money, so it will give us more money to have for recruiting,"
McKeever said. "I'm not offended at all because they obviously
respect what we have and where [Coach] Pete Carroll is going, or they
wouldn't be doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Graziano said Oregon spent about $435,000 for seven in-state
billboards and the three in New York, L.A. and the Bay Area. He calls
the campaign a success, despite criticism from some that Oregon is
exploiting athletes to promote the school.</TE>
<TE>   "We've certainly received a lot of attention for it," Graziano
said. "That means it works."</TE>

<HD>USC Fans, He Has His Thinking Cap Back On</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I came back from vacation a new man. A USC fan.</LD>
<LD>   I put on my USC baseball cap, arrived at the Coliseum for Monday
night's scrimmage and noticed they had valet parking for Trojan fans.
Valet parking at the Coliseum--now that's funny.</LD>
<LD>   I was waved to the car hijacking area just outside the Sports
Arena. I guess they were unaware I was a new man. However, they did
seem to know who I was.</LD>
<TE>   Now, I had called USC President Steven Sample earlier in the day
to ask his secretary, Jackie, if she could tell me what I wanted to
ask the president two years ago when I first called--in case we
bumped into each other at the Coliseum. After waiting two years for a
return call, I can't remember why I called.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't help you," said Jackie. "I've only been here a year."</TE>
<TE>   She offered to take a message, assured me she would get it to the
president and the president would get back to me. If she was
referring to Bush, I got a chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I THINK I blended in well with the other Trojan fans in my
baseball cap. One of the coaches walked by and said, "What's up, big
man," which was an improvement over "Scram, media hack." Of course, I
hadn't run into Athletic Director Mike Garrett yet; we don't get to
park in the same lots.</TE>
<TE>   I told Tim Tessalone, the school's sports information director, to
let Garrett know I wanted to talk, and right away he said, "I think
he's busy right now." Tessalone is either clairvoyant, or there's a
memo specifying Garrett is always busy if one particular person
wishes to speak with him.</TE>
<TE>   I tipped my USC cap to remind him I was one of them now and said I
really wanted to talk with Garrett, and he began playing, "Let's make
a deal."</TE>
<TE>   "I think I could get you up to see him [in the press box at the
big donors'] party if you</TE>
<TE>   were to buy a table for the Salute to Troy</TE>
<TE>   dinner Friday," Tessalone said. "I think they go for about
$10,000. You write out a check,</TE>
<TE>   and I'll take you there now. What do you</TE>
<TE>   say?"</TE>
<TE>   I can only imagine what the charge to talk with Sample must be.</TE>
<TE>   I thought about how far I had come as a USC fan, however. For the
last two years I wouldn't have given two cents to hear a thing
Garrett had to say, and now I was going to call Sports Editor Bill
Dwyre to authorize a $10,000 expenditure. I just had to find out what
country club he was playing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I GAVE up on Garrett and yelled to Coach Pete Carroll as he threw
a football to his son, while waiting for the Trojans to begin
warmups. He kept his back to me and tried backpedaling off the field
like I might get the hint he didn't want to talk with me. But I
wanted him to know I was with him now, and when he saw my USC
baseball cap, he ignored it. I guess he has been spending a lot of
time with Henry Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine you have to put on a show for all the big donors
tonight," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about those people," Carroll said with a wave of his
hand, and I swear I was listening to Henry Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'VE AGREED to speak to the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County
Trojan Club in Encino this November, because I'm a new man and I care
about those people even if Carroll doesn't. I've also been assured
those people won't throw anything at me. I guess Garrett hasn't been
invited.</TE>
<TE>   I have a new office at The Times and already have a piece of art
to be hung on the wall. It's a beautiful framed poster of a sold-out
Husky Stadium, the boats in the water adjacent to the field, and the
date, Sept. 22, 1990, at the bottom with the final score: Washington
31, USC 0.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't able to find any posters that had USC winning, so it's
the USC thought that counts.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans will kick off this season against Auburn on my
birthday in the Coliseum. I know there are plans already to have four
Navy fighters fly over the stadium and fireworks to celebrate, but
I'll just be looking for a USC victory and a personal Happy Birthday
wish from Garrett--free of charge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHAT'S THE big deal about the Oregon football sign on the Hotel
Figueroa? It just shows three Duck receivers dropping passes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CHOKING DOGS have won five games in a row (just by coincidence
while I've been on vacation), and the headline in the morning
newspaper read: "It's Troubling to Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan, the Dodgers' so-called leader, who blew off the
media for at least the third time this season so he could be left
alone to pout, is unhappy because Manager Jim Tracy is playing a hot
hitter in Marquis Grissom and keeping him on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   I would say this is very Gary Sheffield-like, but Shef has nine
more home runs, 21 more runs batted in, 22 fewer strikeouts and a
batting average 34 points higher than Jordan. Sheffield, like most
Dodger fans, would also know better--knowing it's only a matter of
time before Grissom starts striking out again with regularity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HAD YOU asked me before this weekend, who would win a major first:
Rich Beem or Phil Mickelson? Once I had been assured that Beem was a
professional golfer, I would have answered correctly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW THAT the Chargers have announced they will start the season
with Drew Brees at quarterback, we'll see if the Mission Bay Shrimp
is a big enough man to accept his role as backup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OUR NEIGHBORS' Tom &amp; Aida put their house up for sale while I was
home on vacation. I wonder why.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Cupid Junction:</TE>
<TE>   "Hurry, your date is waiting. We have a guaranteed love match for
you, if you respond by Sunday to this once in a life-time offer, this
beauty will make you feel like a king."</TE>
<TE>   And the wife said there was no reason to check my e-mail while on
vacation.</TE>

<HD>Toluca, UNAM, America Roll On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the new Mexican season barely two weeks old, only three of the
league's 20 teams--Toluca, UNAM and Club America--remain unbeaten and
untied.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Cardozo, the Paraguay national team striker who scored four
goals in Toluca's first two matches, added two over the weekend as
Toluca routed Morelia, 4-1, to improve to 3-0-0.</LD>
<LD>   Brazilian-born forward Zinha scored Toluca's other goals.</LD>
<TE>   UNAM, coached by former Mexico national team star Hugo Sanchez,
also is 3-0-0 after the Pumas defeated Monterrey, 2-1, on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian Emerson gave UNAM the lead, but Monterrey, coached by
1978 World Cup winner Daniel Passarella of Argentina, tied it on a
goal by Argentine Walter Ervitti.</TE>
<TE>   A mistake by goalkeeper Omar Ortiz allowed Rafael Marquez to score
the winner seven minutes from the end.</TE>
<TE>   Club America is 2-0-0 after the defending champions beat San Luis,
2-1, with Mexico national team striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco and former
Chile national team standout Ivan Zamorano scoring for the winners.</TE>
<TE>   Chivas of Guadalajara are 0-2-1 after being tied by the Jaguares
de Chiapas, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Ebner to the Rescue</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State freshman Stephanie Ebner was called up to join the
U.S. under-19 women's national team for the rest of the FIFA Under-19
Women's World Championship in Canada after midfielder Amy Steadman
suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee Saturday
during the team's 5-1 opening-game victory over England.</TE>
<TE>   Ebner, from Taylorsville, Utah, was one of three alternates on
Coach Tracey Leone's roster.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Heads for Finland</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. under-17 national team will play three games against
Finland in Helsinki on Thursday, Saturday and Monday as Coach John
Ellinger tries to acclimatize the players to the conditions they
might face in next year's FIFA Under-17 World Championship in
Finland.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-player American roster includes defender Brandon Owens of
Murrieta, who plays for the La Jolla Nomads, and midfielder Guillermo
Gonzalez of Paramount, who plays for the Irvine Strikers.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans, who finished fourth in the 1999 world championship
in New Zealand when such players as Landon Donovan and DaMarcus
Beasley were on the team, face a potentially difficult CONCACAF
qualifying tournament in March in Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is the only country to take part in every under-17 world
championship since the first in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Best Back in Hospital</TE>
<TE>   Former European player of the year George Best, who underwent a
10-hour liver transplant July 30, has been readmitted to Cromwell
Hospital in London for treatment of a surgery-related infection.</TE>
<TE>   A hospital spokesman said Best, 56, had been readmitted over the
weekend because of "a complication related to a local infection which
is now under control and his condition is improving."</TE>
<TE>   Talebi Quits Syria</TE>
<TE>   Jalal Talebi, the coach who led Iran to its 1998 World Cup victory
over the U.S. in France, has quit as coach of Syria's national team
after less than a year, claiming that his four-year plan to improve
the team was being undercut by demands from Syrian soccer federation
leaders for immediate success.</TE>
<TE>   Talebi, an Iranian whose family lives in California, said he would
return to the U.S. and consider other coaching offers, including one
from Bahrain.</TE>
<TE>   Shevchenko Injured</TE>
<TE>   AC Milan and Ukraine national team forward Andriy Shevchenko, one

<HD>He Came to Pass</HD>
<DH>Spurrier tries to keep it fun for Redskins, particularly
for his favorites: the quarterbacks</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLISLE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>It's confession time, and Washington Redskin quarterbacks Danny
Wuerffel and Shane Matthews have a whopper of a transgression to
tell--one that would get them booted out of any other NFL city.</LD>
<LD>   They don't study their playbooks.</LD>
<LD>   Barely even glance at them.</LD>
<TE>   So the Redskins go out and spend $5 million a year on Coach Steve
Spurrier, signing him to a five-year deal, hoping he can resurrect a
proud franchise that has reached the playoffs once since Joe Gibbs
left after the 1992 season, and the leading candidates for the No. 1
quarterback job treat his playbook as if it's an in-flight magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Informed of this, Spurrier gives a little shrug and smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't even refer to the playbook a lot," he says. "We teach
off the board most of the time. We've got [a playbook] with all the
stuff in it, but we only ask people to bring it to the night
meetings."</TE>
<TE>   And, seeing as how Wuerffel and Matthews played under Spurrier at
Florida, they needed only a brief refresher to get up to speed. The
way they see it, Spurrier's "Fun 'n' Gun" offense is so logical, a
quarterback who learns the basic building blocks can pick up the rest
as he goes.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing about football is when you're 5 years old, you
drop back and throw the ball, and the guy catches it," says Wuerffel,
the 1996 Heisman Trophy winner who is competing for the starting job
with Matthews, Sage Rosenfels and first-round pick Patrick Ramsey.
"So whatever you can do to still be able to do that is what makes it
fun. And Coach Spurrier's the best at it."</TE>
<TE>   Although Spurrier is believed to be leaning toward starting
Wuerffel, the coach said last week he might not reveal his No. 1
quarterback until the offense takes the field on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   Most experienced is nine-year veteran Matthews, who spent his
first eight seasons in West Coast offenses at Chicago and Carolina.
He says the biggest challenge for him isn't learning Spurrier's
plays--those are seared into his memory--but remembering he's free to
be creative at the line of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had to retrain my mind," he says. "I've been in the same
offense for eight years, and it's whatever play's called, go run it.
No matter if they've got eight guys in there [on or near the line of
scrimmage], if you've got to run a play, run it and they expect to
block it. It really doesn't make any sense, but that's the way
coaches are.</TE>
<TE>   "With Coach Spurrier, it's basically common sense. They've got a
bunch of dudes in there? Throw it over their heads. If they've got a
big soft zone, let's run it."</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier, the self-described "ball coach" who had 112 victories in
12 seasons at Florida, has devised an offensive system that even
sounds uncluttered. In the West Coast offense, Matthews might duck
into the huddle and call,
"Stem-to-east-right-zing-close-A-Z-fly-scat-322-Y-stick-X-post."</TE>
<TE>   In Spurrier-speak, a pass play sounds more like, "Right-14-extra."</TE>
<TE>   His system is sophisticated, players say, and involves dozens of
formations. Perhaps more than other offenses, it requires
quarterbacks and receivers to know each other's next step. In fact,
when the Redskins break up for individual meetings, Spurrier keeps
the quarterbacks and receivers together, something most NFL coaches
don't do.</TE>
<TE>   "The philosophy is, so we'll all know what we're talking about,"
says Spurrier, a former Florida quarterback who won the Heisman in
1966. "Other teams split it up; I don't know how they do it that way.
We like for the quarterback and receiver to hear the same thing,
coming from the same coaches."</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins, who have been through four coaches and three
defensive coordinators since Dan Snyder bought the team in 1999,
started last season 0-5--before winning five in a row--and ranked
last in total offense most of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier replaces Marty Schottenheimer, who now coaches San Diego,
and their styles are vastly different.</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer, who had total control of the football operations,
put alarms on the front doors of the dorms at Dickinson College,
where the Redskins train, enabling coaches to catch players violating
curfew. He fined players for tossing the ball to the wrong person
after a play on the practice field, and once sprinted over to
legendary cornerback Darrell Green--who has almost two decades of
experience as an NFL player--and corrected his backpedaling.
Schottenheimer, who has coached his teams to the playoffs 11 times in
15 NFL seasons, oversaw every aspect of the offense, defense and
special teams.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier is so fixated on the offense, he barely glances in the
direction of the Redskin defense, controlled entirely by defensive
coordinator Marvin Lewis. Early in training camp, when asked his
opinion of a defensive player, Spurrier said: "I'm over there with
the offense. I don't know who's out there half the time, not on
defense. They rotate. We're rotating players. What am I supposed to
do, [crane my neck and] say, 'Who's that out there?' We don't care
who's out there."</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 1,000 times a practice, Spurrier invokes a favorite
phrase--"We're going to pitch it around"--sometimes clapping his
hands for emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   Before Spurrier arrived at camp, he had the alarms removed. And,
although he too imposes a curfew, no one gets docked for being a few
seconds late.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our rules and regulations, but he makes it a nice
pleasant atmosphere, where the coaches and players can communicate
and spend time together," defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson says.</TE>
<TE>   Although Spurrier appears to be less tightly wound than
Schottenheimer and freely admits he cannot recall ever sleeping at
the office, his visor-tossing outbursts are well documented. (He
throws the visor into the air, by the way, because slamming it to the
ground leaves grass stains.)</TE>
<TE>   "He knows we're going to make mistakes, we're going to change the
plays," Matthews says. "If you call a bad play, just don't let it
turn into a horrible play. If you have to throw an incompletion,
throw it out of bounds, dump it off to the back, just don't make a
dumb mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell if the Redskins made the right move in hiring
Spurrier, the highest-paid coach in NFL history. The combination of a
combustible coach and a meddlesome owner could turn toxic if the
Redskins don't win right away. Snyder has attended most training-camp
practices this summer, swooping in aboard a helicopter that lands on
an adjacent field.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently accused of running up the score in college, Spurrier
heard similar cries in the Aug. 4 exhibition opener when the Redskins
rolled over San Francisco, 38-7. He was irked when 49er Coach Steve
Mariucci accused him of leaving his starters in the game longer than
was warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the Redskins set a winning tone on national TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Might have found a couple new plays too," Spurrier says.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing his quarterbacks as well as he does, the coach won't
bother updating the playbook.</TE>

<HD>Father Figures in Dokic Mystery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the sadder sights of the summer hard-court campaign in
Southern California was seen on a chilly Saturday night at Manhattan
Beach, the eve of the final between Chanda Rubin and Lindsay
Davenport.</LD>
<LD>   It had nothing to do with forehands landing long and wide, or
double faults. This unfolded off the court, in the weight room at
Manhattan Country Club a few hours after Jelena Dokic had turned in a
sorry performance in the semifinals, losing to Rubin, 6-0, 6-2, in 41
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Why had Dokic, currently the No. 4-ranked women's player, slipped
into "semi-tank mode," as Rubin put it?</LD>
<TE>   Dokic only heightened the intrigue when she sent word through the
WTA public relations staff that she had been ill against Rubin ...
then went out later that evening to play doubles with Kim Clijsters.
And they won.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Dokic still had a mandatory media requirement, which
she fulfilled in the weight room, talking to two reporters. She
talked about feeling poorly against Rubin because of a stomach virus,
saying it had hurt her feelings to hear some booing from the crowd.
Dokic smiled ruefully when reminded that the doubles victory meant
another match, in the final on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   What really happened that Saturday?</TE>
<TE>   ESPN commentators Pam Shriver and Mary Joe Fernandez said Dokic
had been seen crying shortly before her match against Rubin. A
courtside spectator, Mike Reuben of Anaheim Hills, said in an
interview that he'd seen Dokic talking on a mobile phone just before
the semifinal, near the weight room, visibly upset. He said she
handed the phone to tournament officials, telling them to have her
mother call her father.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, it all comes back to Dokic's controversial father and
coach, Damir, who had been, it seemed, safely off the scene, staying
at home in Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   This answers some questions, but raises others. Did this have
something to do with Damir's recently hatched plan to move from
Belgrade to England? Or with speculation that Damir is unhappy about
Jelena's new relationship with Brazilian race driver Enrique
Bernoldi? Or, had Damir taken ill?</TE>
<TE>   We may never find out what happened. Dokic has always publicly
supported her father, dating back to his outlandish drunken behavior
in Birmingham, England, in 1999 and Wimbledon in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But the Manhattan Beach episode was different. Dokic usually keeps
her head when all is chaos, sometimes playing her best tennis when
the crisis is most severe.</TE>
<TE>   This time, she simply couldn't do that. It was unsettling to see
the talented 19-year-old unable to function on the court, usually her
safe harbor.</TE>
<TE>   But it should be known--particularly by paying fans--that there is
more to her story than forehands and backhands. There is some reason
Dokic plays more matches than most other top female players--she is
45-17 in 2002, and has been playing nonstop since Palo Alto last
month.</TE>
<TE>   If Dokic plays this week, as scheduled, at New Haven, Conn., it
will be her fifth consecutive tournament. These should be the best
days for Dokic, who reached a career-high No. 4 ranking Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But clearly, something isn't right. And so, the unhappiest
fourth-ranked player you'll ever see keeps on going week after week,
retiring from about a fifth of her tournaments and finishing others
under dubious circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charisma Calling</TE>
<TE>   The latest blow to the men's tour landed last week when former
two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter of Australia put down the
rumors that he was pondering a comeback this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Rafter, a new father, is enjoying his new role.</TE>
<TE>   As often happens, though, there was an upbeat note in the charisma
department by the weekend. About a year ago, Rafter won a match at
Cincinnati and gave some words of encouragement to an American
youngster at the net.</TE>
<TE>   That youngster was James Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Blake won his first ATP tournament title on Sunday in Washington,
D.C., defeating Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand in three sets. He is
the first African American to have won at Washington since Arthur
Ashe in 1973 and became the fourth to have won a singles title in the
Open era, joining Ashe (33), Mal Washington (4) and Bryan Shelton
(2).</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime I'm put in the sentence with Arthur Ashe is very
significant for me, it's just incredible," Blake said. "From my
childhood, I was proud to say he was my role model and now the more
and more I keep hearing, 'You're the first one to do this since
Arthur Ashe,' is mind-boggling.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't comprehend beating Andre Agassi [in the semifinals],
winning my first title and being the first African American to win
here since Arthur Ashe."</TE>
<TE>   Blake's victory celebration was exuberant but his title will have
a lasting legacy. Because of long-held bets, now that Blake has won,
his father, Thomas, will have to shave his beard and his coach, Brian
Barker, and agent, Carlos Fleming, have to go on another adventure
with him--skydiving. Barker does have the option of shaving his head.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking Stock</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras came close to breaking his tournament drought at the
ATP stop on Long Island last year, losing to Tommy Haas in three sets
in the final. A year later, he remains without a title in his last 32
events, dating to Wimbledon 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sampras, who turned 31 last week, isn't viewing this year
as a career decision-making one.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of next year, I'll see where it's all at and then make
a decision," Sampras said to reporters at Commack, N.Y. "That doesn't
mean I'm going to stop or continue. I deserve to make my own decision
as to when I leave the sport."</TE>

<HD>Bear Market Is Bad for a Bruin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruin tackle Bryce Bohlander took a vicious hit over the summer, long
before he reported to training camp.</LD>
<LD>   "I lost 12,000 sandbags in WorldCom alone," he said, a lament that
requires explanation.</LD>
<LD>   An avid investor in the stock market, the senior three-year
starter saw a cool $6,000 in WorldCom stock evaporate, one of several
losers in a portfolio that had grown steadily for years.</LD>
<TE>   Bohlander built a bank account during high school in Keizer, Ore.,
working 30 hours a week filling bags with pea gravel. It was
piecework--50 cents a bag--so he calculates his WorldCom loss in
terms of sandbags.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost a lot, like a lot of people," he said. "All through the
'90s, everything you bought went up, so it's the way it goes."</TE>
<TE>   The bear market hasn't cut his appetite for investing, though.
Bohlander said he still has money in 18 mutual funds and seven
individual stocks in addition to bonds and mortgage-backed
securities.</TE>
<TE>   He's picked several winners recently, including selling
Halliburton and Washington Mutual at substantial gains.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good time to buy," he said. "People are like sheep.
They follow one another and act out of emotion. For me, I'm young and
everything is about building for retirement. I'm still aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   The last several days, of course, his attention has turned from
Enron to end runs.</TE>
<TE>   Bohlander is a key member of a line that has returning starters at
every position but center.</TE>
<TE>   "There [are] a lot of expectations on [the line]," he said. "There
is so much to go over and so much time on the field, I'm not even
looking at my stocks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For two years, behemoth running back Manuel White has dominated
spring scrimmages at Drake Stadium and flattened countless defenders
during practices at Spaulding Field.</TE>
<TE>   Now he believes it is time for those hits to reverberate all over
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really feeling ready," he said. "Everything is clicking."</TE>
<TE>   White, a 6-foot-3, 245-pound redshirt sophomore, is listed No. 1
at fullback on the depth chart, although he probably won't play as
much as No. 2 Pat Norton. He is listed No. 2 at tailback, although he
might play as much as No. 1 Akil Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at it as competition," White said. "There are enough
snaps for all of us.</TE>
<TE>   "The main difference is that I have to know both positions. The
technique at fullback is all new to me, but I'll do anything to help
the team."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of where he lines up, White is a dangerous receiver and
runner. Last season, he had five catches for 64 yards and rushed for
290 yards, averaging 4.6 a carry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA coaches and players have said they would like to return to
Cal Lutheran next fall, but a scheduling conflict with Cal Lutheran
training camp might make it difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Other options for the Bruins, who will be unable to use Spaulding
Field because of on-campus construction, are UC Irvine, Cal State
Dominguez Hills and the Oxnard facility used by the Oakland Raiders
during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine might have the edge because it is where new UCLA Athletic
Director Dan Guerrero was previously employed.</TE>
<TE>   "Irvine is a great venue for a training camp," said Guerrero, who
added that he plans to talk to Bruin coaches and players before
making a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo's first choice is a return to Cal Lutheran.</TE>
<TE>   "The people here have been wonderful and the facilities are
first-rate," he said.</TE>

<HD>Team's Focus Concerns Carroll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his team two weeks away from its Sept. 2 opener against Auburn,
USC Coach Pete Carroll stood on the Coliseum turf after the Trojans'
uninspiring scrimmage Monday night and said his team must begin
sharpening its focus.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll start zeroing in on Auburn now," Carroll said. "I'm not
going to feel good until we kick this thing off and start playing and
look like we have our act together."</LD>
<LD>   Several key players, including tailbacks Justin Fargas, Sultan
McCullough and Darryl Poston, wide receiver Kareem Kelly and safety
Troy Polamalu, did not play because of injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Fearing injury to other front-line players, Carroll did not allow
the first-team offense to face the first-team defense during the
84-play scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   The offense scored twice in 12 possessions. The Trojans rushed for
only 47 yards in 32 carries and quarterbacks passed for 311 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Starting quarterback Carson Palmer completed nine of 15 passes for
163 yards and connected with receiver Grant Mattos for a 39-yard
touchdown pass play on the first drive. Two series later, linebacker
Oscar Lua intercepted a short pass from Palmer in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Matt Leinart struggled after he was elevated to No. 2
on the depth chart because of a knee injury suffered by Matt Cassel
Saturday. Leinart completed six of 13 passes for 68 yards, but had
two intercepted and was sacked four times.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said when Cassel returns, possibly next week, he and
Leinart will resume competing for the No. 2 job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman fullback Brandon Hancock fumbled after catching a pass on
the first play, but was otherwise solid for the second time in two
scrimmages.</TE>
<TE>   He had two receptions for 38 yards and rushed for 20 yards in
three carries.</TE>
<TE>   But senior Malaefou MacKenzie and freshman Hershel Dennis did not
take advantage of their opportunities at tailback with Fargas,
McCullough and Poston sidelined. MacKenzie gained seven yards in
three carries and Dennis rushed for 21 yards in 10 carries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunny Byrd emerged as the starting tailback last season after
injuries wiped out depth at the position midway through the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd returned to fullback at the start of training camp, but with
Fargas, McCullough and Poston out because of hamstring problems, Byrd
got carries at tailback for the second time in three days.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some kind of hamstring disease going on with the
tailbacks," Byrd said.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, who rushed for 336 yards and four touchdowns last season,
took two snaps at tailback and gained seven yards, four on a
touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were not in pads or helmets during a morning practice
at Howard Jones Field that featured a walkthrough of their pregame
routine.</TE>
<TE>   Before going over special teams and offensive sets, players lined
up along the sideline and sang the national anthem.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd give us a 10 for effort," center Norm Katnik said. "That's
the only comment I'd have on that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond was released from the hospital
after five days of treatment for an infection in his right knee.</TE>

<HD>Sting Franchise in Limbo</HD>

<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Charlotte's season ended when the Washington Mystics swept the Sting
out of the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Sting faces a question the WNBA is hesitant to answer.</LD>
<LD>   What next? Charlotte began the 2002 season as a grand experiment,
the first WNBA team not tied to an NBA city.</LD>
<TE>   The NBA's Hornets, who finished their season in Charlotte, are on
their way to New Orleans. With them goes the Sting's safety net, as
well as weight room equipment and office space.</TE>
<TE>   The lease agreement on the Sting's offices ends Sept. 28.</TE>
<TE>   League officials said in May that one of the key considerations,
if the Sting were to have a future in Charlotte, would be attendance
this season. Well, Charlotte ranked 15th among 16 teams, averaging
6,667 a game.</TE>
<TE>   That was marginally better than the 6,595 Charlotte averaged last
year, when the team, after a 1-10 start, reached the WNBA finals.
Those numbers are also consistent with the attendance the Sting has
had in six years in Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   In what could have been the team's final game in Charlotte, the
Sting drew 6,038 for the playoff game with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Looming is San Antonio. That city, which has the NBA's Spurs, will
be granted a WNBA franchise if officials there can sell 6,000 season
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio reportedly is at 4,000 and counting and has until Nov.
15 to reach the goal.</TE>
<TE>   WNBA Commissioner Val Ackerman has said she'd prefer that San
Antonio be an expansion franchise.</TE>
<TE>   She also has said that it's time for the league "to look at a new
business model"--considering the possibility of WNBA teams surviving
in cities not anchored by NBA teams.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it's to be, Charlotte officials would feel more
comfortable if they could get some signal from the WNBA. So far, not
a peep.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the WNBA wants to see if former NBA stars M.L. Carr (now
president of the Sting) and Larry Bird can pull together the
necessary financing to bring another expansion NBA team to Charlotte.
But that's, at best, a couple of years away.</TE>
<TE>   The Sting needs some answers now.</TE>
<TE>   Short Shrift</TE>
<TE>   WNBA officials recognize that eventually they will have to
lengthen the league's regular season, which runs 32 games.</TE>
<TE>   There also needs to be some thought given to lengthening the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The league's best-of-three format is too short for anything but
the first round. The conference finals and league championship series
should be best of five. That would give more value to earning the
home-court advantage.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the team with home-court advantage must start its
playoff series on the road, then play the final two games on its home
court.</TE>
<TE>   If the series were allowed to go five games, the team with
home-court advantage could start at home for two games, then, if
necessary, have the fifth and deciding game on its court.</TE>
<TE>   A longer series also would lessen the odds of a better team
getting put out by a fluke play or key injury.</TE>
<TE>   Man in Demand</TE>
<TE>   Attention, Johnny Buss.</TE>
<TE>   As president of the Sparks, you are certainly aware that the
Denver Nuggets had more than a passing interest in your coach,
Michael Cooper, and were ready to make him a generous offer to join
their staff.</TE>
<TE>   You are just as aware that Denver will not be the only NBA team
interested in Cooper when his contract ends next season, especially
if he coaches the Sparks to another championship or two.</TE>
<TE>   And you're probably aware that Houston recently locked up its
coach, Van Chancellor, for three more years.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how you feel about the job Cooper has done or his
standing as a former Laker player who has wanted to remain part of
the Laker family.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Sparks want to hang onto the winningest coach in their
franchise's history, don't wait until the last second to start
thinking about his next contract.</TE>
