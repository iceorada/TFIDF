<HD>He Sets the Bar for TV's 'Reality' Stars and Fans</HD>

<LD>On most nights at the Belly Lounge in West Hollywood, chances are
you'll see a familiar face from last season.</LD>
<LD>   The bar/restaurant, owned by Mike "Boogie" Malin--former
contestant on "Big Brother 2"--draws a crowd of "reality stars."
Here, in addition to Malin, you might spot Ethan Zohn, winner of
"Survivor: Africa" or Will Kirby, another "Big Brother 2" contestant.
Gabriel Cade, one of the bartenders, appeared on "Survivor:
Marquesas."</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica Boulevard bar has become an unofficial contestant
incubator for unscripted series like "Survivor" and "Big Brother," as
well as the hangout where winners and the "voted out" get over the
loathing of each other conceived in the heat of the TV moment.</LD>
<TE>   (According to Malin, Gina Crews and Hunter Ellis, who competed on
"Marquesas," had dinner at the lounge with producer Mark Burnett.
"They had a meal and worked out their problems.")</TE>
<TE>   And Malin and Kirby are entering the bar/restaurant business
together, said Malin, seated at Belly on a recent afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Kirby, who won $500,000, will be investing in their joint venture,
Malin said. "I'm going to hit every [contestant] up for money."</TE>
<TE>   The love fest between Belly and "reality" began when "Big Brother"
casting agents spotted Malin working behind the bar and encouraged
the self-described "wacky bar owner" to send them a videotape.</TE>
<TE>   That eventually brought him to the final round of
selections--eight days in a San Fernando Valley hotel, where CBS
asked potential contestants to undergo psychological and physical
tests.</TE>
<TE>   Malin landed a spot in "Big Brother 2" and a peculiar kind of
fame.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists, he said, come to his bar to buy commemorative T-shirts
(he wore a Belly shirt on the show), have a drink with him or ask him
to autograph various body parts.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a tourist and you come to L.A., you visit Grauman's
Chinese, Rodeo Drive and Belly, Malin said with the confidence of a
"Big Brother" player.</TE>
<TE>   The attraction is access.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Cruise or Matthew Perry are inaccessible," he said. "Reality
people are more real. [Viewers] feel like they know you."</TE>
<TE>   Malin isn't surprised that Belly launched its "reality" stars.</TE>
<TE>   "You obviously have a much better chance working in a bar where
casting agents come in than sitting in Iowa, submitting the tapes
from your dental office," said Malin, acknowledging the cruel nexus
of fame and geography.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "bars and restaurants tend to employ colorful
personalities....</TE>
<TE>   "People skills are required to be successful. And you definitely
need [those] on 'Big Brother' and 'Survivor.'"</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Yoakam's country music career has often meandered into the
Hollywood spheres of acting, directing and producing. But he seemed
content to leave the celebrity food merchandising to Paul Newman
(spaghetti sauce, salad dressing, etc.) and Francis Ford Coppola
(wine). Until this year, that is. In February, Yoakam launched a line
of ready-to-eat, Southern-style biscuits smothered in various gravies
and stews.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the project started as a joke. About five years
ago, Buck Owens urged Yoakam to bring "something special" to the
opening of the Crystal Palace, Owens' restaurant and museum in
Bakersfield. Yoakam was stumped for an idea. Then, during breakfast
at a diner on Sunset Boulevard, the Kentucky native remembered his
Granny Irlene's "hillbilly" biscuit recipe. He whipped up a batch for
Owens' opening.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the biscuits were on Owens' menu, and fans at concerts were
clamoring to order them, especially once Yoakam started selling
"Bakersfield Biscuits" T-shirts and baseball hats (one of which Vince
Vaughn wore in the film "Made.")</TE>
<TE>   Yoakam even recorded "Biscuit Boy," a song about a fictional
character inspired by his new enterprise. "I was just having fun with
the idea of it ... the Route 66, Americana element of it," he said by
phone Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Yoakam tried to meet demand but soon discovered that fresh
biscuits had too short a shelf life to be cost-effective. So he took
the next step. He scrapped Granny's recipe and went frozen.</TE>
<TE>   "As you know," he explained, "once you move into the frozen world,
you change the food metabolically and you have to have a food
scientist."</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Yoakam's Bakersfield Biscuits are available in select
stores in California and the Dallas area, and the biscuits will be
widely distributed later this year.</TE>
<TE>   This, Yoakam promises, is just the beginning. His food scientist
is working on a cornbread recipe. Gravy also sounds promising.</TE>
<TE>   "I may do a sausage," he said. "It's all pretty hillbilly."</TE>

<LD>THE LAST AMERICAN MAN</LD>
<LD>   By Elizabeth Gilbert</LD>
<LD>   Viking</LD>
<TE>   272 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Picture him: He's wearing handmade buckskin clothing with a knife
sheathed under his belt. He eats possum and roadkill. He's lived in a
tepee for 17 years. He's hiked the 2,000-mile Appalachian Trail
wearing a loincloth, surviving on what he could find along the way.
He's crossed the United States on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   Meet Eustace Conway, the subject of Elizabeth Gilbert's insightful
"The Last American Man," a man on a mission to lead Americans away
from consumerism and back to the arms of Mother Nature.</TE>
<TE>   Conway, who could be described as a cross between Grizzly Adams
and Daniel Boone, has not stepped out of the pages of history. He's a
current-day messiah, a 40-year-old symbol of virility, the surviving
manifestation of our Manifest Destiny, a flesh-and-blood embodiment
of the pioneering spirit that drove this country in years past. He is
an anachronism walking the streets of, say, Manhattan, in his
wilderness get-up. He talks to cynical school kids about surviving in
the wild, making converts out of the toughest of the tough. He
strikes up conversations with drug dealers in New York's Tompkins
Square Park, explaining how he hunted and skinned the deer to make
his clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert artfully taps into this unique life to create a
fascinating, deeply thought-out and enthralling narrative. The
book--one part psychobiography of Conway and his mission, one part
social commentary on what his life says about the altered role of the
American male--shines a halogen-bright light on Conway's lifestyle to
show us this throwback to another era when the Western-expansion
mythology thrived.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert ("Stern Men") first met Conway through his younger
brother, Judson, with whom she'd once worked on a ranch in the
Wyoming Rockies. By that time, Gilbert was keenly aware of her
weakness for the lure of the wilderness and cowboy mythology. "They
all called me Blaze," she writes of her tenure on the ranch. "But
only because I asked 'em to." Gilbert knows herself to be a "faker"
when it comes to authentic wilderness living but sees in Judson's
brother something genuine.</TE>
<TE>   "My initial reaction on witnessing Eustace Conway's life was
relief .... [A]ll I could think was Thank God. Thank God somebody in
America was still living this way. Thank God that there was at least
one genuine mountain man, frontiersman, pioneer, maverick out there."</TE>
<TE>   Her reaction is not an uncommon one. Conway's charismatic
presence, style of dress and "Man of Destiny" self-image have a
pronounced effect on everyone he meets, an effect Gilbert chronicles
even as she begins to peek beyond it. The resulting narrative pushes
past the easy infatuation with Conway's dynamic personality and his
save-the-world idealism to uncover a more genuine, complex and, at
times, contradictory story.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in suburban South Carolina on the edge of the woods, Conway
spent his childhood looking for validation from a father who saw in
him nothing to validate. If Conway could not earn his father's
recognition in conventional ways, Gilbert argues, then he'd create
his own coming-of-age rituals to celebrate his entrance into
adulthood. Ultimately, she argues, this is the driving force behind
just about everything he proceeds to do. She details his many
exploits with skillful writing, intersecting the stories with
well-researched analyses of pioneering legends, as well as the
history of utopian societies in America. In Conway's life, Gilbert
traces the vanishing arc of the American pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   With vast plans to change how Americans interact with the natural
world, he toils to create (with a loan from his father) Turtle
Island, which has become a 1,000-acre educational center hidden in
the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. He attracts
flocks of apprentices who sign on for two-year commitments to work
there with no pay beyond the adventure of learning.</TE>
<TE>   Yet after a month or two, most pack it in, unable to put up with
Conway's domineering, at times coldhearted personality. With an
overwhelming desire to marry and start a family, Conway woos scores
of dynamic women. The love stories all end in heartbreak, though,
when his idealism, perfectionism and hard-driving disposition demand
more than any modern-day American woman, even the most hearty and
wilderness-ready, can give.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of Gilbert's sharp account, Conway shifts from a
fire-eyed evangelist to a man on the cusp of middle age, who fears he
may be losing the battle to bring us all back to nature. "The Last
American Man" explores through the lens of Eustace Conway's
particular life our modern infatuation with the myth of the
pioneering man and succeeds in uncovering the human reality behind
it.</TE>

<HD>Once Upon a Time, in a Land Called USA</HD>
<DH>Publishing* Lynne Cheney teams up with an artist from
Southern California on a book to educate kids (and adults) about
America's history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAMANTHA CRITCHELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, set out to write a
book about the history of the United States that would resonate with
children from coast to coast. It was to be a gift to her three
grandchildren and all the children she meets almost daily as she
travels around the country.</LD>
<LD>   "We're so privileged to live in this country that we should know
the story of how we got to be so fortunate," Cheney said.</LD>
<LD>   Even with her background as a former chairwoman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities and as self-described perennial student
of American history, Cheney said she learned quite a bit when
researching "America: A Patriotic Primer" (Simon &amp; Schuster).</LD>
<TE>   The original intent was to create a kids' book, Cheney said, "but
the more we worked on it, the more we began to think that we loved it
so much maybe other grown-ups might too." She added, "It's a curious
fact that John Adams thought we'd celebrate our country's birthday on
July 2 .... That's the day they voted on the resolution for
independence."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney hopes compelling characters such as Adams, Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison and Martin Luther King Jr. and real-life
drama will encourage children's enthusiasm for stories. "We [adults]
all know how the story came out, we know that the men who signed the
Declaration of Independence were the winners in the end, that the
drive for American independence succeeded," she said. "But if you
start with little kids and explain to them that this wasn't a
powerful country and we didn't have much by way of an army or a navy,
and we decided that we were going to go up against the strongest
military force in the world then, it's a David-and-Goliath story."</TE>
<TE>   The book, illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser of Newport Beach, is
essentially an alphabet book, with each letter standing for an idea
or an ideal--"C is for the Constitution that binds us together"; "F
is for Freedom and the Flag that we fly"; and "V is for the Valor
shown by those who've kept us free."</TE>
<TE>   When it came to the illustrations, which cram historical facts
onto each page with a lighthearted touch, Glasser saw "T is for
Tolerance" as one of the biggest challenges. Glasser said she
consulted with her sister and chief researcher, Jacqueline, about
what really takes tolerance. They came up with a young aspiring
musician who has more enthusiasm than talent playing the cymbals and
driving another percussionist crazy. But there they are, standing
next to each other, each allowed to do his own thing. The "T" page is
bordered with small pictures of different holiday celebrations, from
Mormon Pioneer Day to Presidents Day. "I wanted to show how we
celebrate side by side Ramadan and Easter," said Glasser.</TE>
<TE>   The same was true of G, as in "G is for God." "God was a sensitive
page to do. We wanted this to be a book for everyone," Glasser said.
But then a picture came to her, one that could be from New York or
Main Street, USA: a temple next to a Baptist church next to a mosque.
"This is how we live," she observed. Glasser's idea for the cover,
five children planting a flagpole in a field of flowers, was inspired
by the image she saw on television on Sept. 11 of the three
firefighters raising a flag amid the ruins of the World Trade Center.
The scene was more than a little reminiscent of the famous 1945
photograph of American soldiers raising the flag at Iwo Jima. Glasser
borrowed an issue of Life magazine that featured the photo from the
N.Y. Public Library and used it as reference.</TE>
<TE>   The book was in the works before Sept. 11, Cheney said, but
explaining the preciousness and price of freedom took on more meaning
after the terrorist attacks. She wants to encourage children and
parents to see the country beyond their hometown. She wants them to
see and experience what each state has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "On the 'H' and 'I' page [for 'Heroes' and 'Ideals'], look at all
these places you can visit: Sitting Bull's grave, or the Tomb of the
Unknowns in Arlington [Va.] or the Alamo; these are places heroes are
recognized. The Civil Rights Memorial, the Vietnam Memorial, Mount
Rushmore. There are great places all across the country where you can
visit and become more informed and get caught up in some of the
excitement that is American history."</TE>

<DH>Clare Ellis needed an online guide to kids' activities, so
she created one</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HOWLETT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At parks and school bus stops, in Everytown, U.S.A., there have
always been neighborhood kaffeeklatsches, places where kid-friendly
travel ideas are exchanged along with diaper coupons and teething
tips.</LD>
<LD>   Enter the Internet age and GoCityKids, a Web-based guide for
parents that has moved the "what-to-do-with-the-kids" quandary into
cyberspace. Clare Ellis, a mother of two, created the Web site after
moving with her family from Massachusetts to San Francisco two years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Ellis, former editor of Disney's FamilyFun magazine and of
BabyCenter, an online site for parents, found herself roaming the
local bookstore in search of a city resource of activities for
children.</LD>
<TE>   "We were in a rut, going to the same places over and over again,
and I had the distinct sense we were missing out on the best our city
had to offer," she said. But at the bookstore, Ellis says, she found
only tourist guides that fell short when it came to the younger set.</TE>
<TE>   They say that necessity is the mother of invention, and as it
turns out, Ellis became the mother of an invention that has become a
resource for parents across the nation--a Web site that has the kid
world covered city-by-city, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the year, the site plans to cover 25 cities.
Currently it has editors in 10, with an average of 700 listings per
city. The site includes an age-based activity finder, weekly
newsletter, calendar of family-oriented events and a parent rating
system of various attractions.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I take my boys everywhere," says Ellis, 44, who runs the
growing dot-com franchise from the San Francisco home she shares with
her husband, Kip Webb, a pediatrician and health care consultant, and
sons, Ryland, 9, and Gordy, 5.</TE>
<TE>   "We go to museums, shows, playgrounds, take tours, stay in hotels,
try out restaurants. It's a blast," she said, "just what I was hoping
would happen when I first came up with the idea."</TE>
<TE>   GoCityKids.com and its parent company, Rooftop Publishing Inc.,
operate with a staff of about 20 parents, who serve variously as
editors, designers and in business development, Ellis says.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a grass-roots, home-spun organization," says Ellis, who
logs on each day at 7 a.m., juggling bowls of Peanut Butter Bumpers,
sleepy kids in pajamas and school lunches. "But we like it that way,"
she says, adding that GoCityKids editors are asked to visit and
experience everything they publish on the site so other parents can
benefit from their firsthand experience.</TE>
<TE>   The site is used by parents who want to discover hidden,
kid-friendly treasures in their own backyards as well as by those
traveling to unfamiliar city destinations. Users navigate the site by
clicking on a desired city, then choosing an activity or attraction
based on everything from the age of the child, to what he or she
likes or dislikes.</TE>
<TE>   When David Stier planned a "guys trip" with his two boys to visit
their grandmother in south Florida, he went to www.gocitykids.com in
search of adventure in the greater Miami area.</TE>
<TE>   "I have two energetic sons, so we were looking for activities
outdoors," said Stier, a 44-year-old medical research consultant from
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the listings on the site have little blurbs from the
perspective of a child or parent who tell what it was like to go
there," he said. "I had used GoCityKids for things to do in San
Francisco, but never for a trip.</TE>
<TE>   "We ended up finding the greatest place, the Everglades alligator
farm," he said. "We never would have found it otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping parents and their children busy also keeps GoCityKids
editors hopping, says Drew Kristofik, the site's editor in chief
based in Westport, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   "I have done just about everything," says Kristofik, 43, a
childhood friend of Ellis', mother of two and former director of
content for the Nickelodeon Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "I even ran a scavenger hunt from September to November, with
clues all over New York City," she says. "Everywhere you look, we
have something to do."</TE>
<TE>   Kristofik says many parents use the site from afar. "We get a lot
of users from Australia, Europe and Japan," she says. "I assume they
are looking at the calendar and checking out places to stay and where
to eat when they travel to one of our cities. We keep things up to
date."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the activities and listings on the site current is key,
says Kristofik, adding that outdated information is a common problem
with printed city guides.</TE>
<TE>   "I would find a great restaurant in one of the books, and I would
drag my kids all across town to get there, only to find it to be gone
or out of business," she says. "We don't let that happen at
GoCityKids. With the Internet, we can turn on a dime."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its coverage of California's three biggest cities,
GoCityKids covers New York, Boston, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and
Washington, D.C. Later this month, Seattle, Salt Lake City and
Atlanta are expected to be added. By August, an additional round of
expansion is planned to take in Austin, Houston, Portland, Ore., and
the Twin Cities.</TE>

<LD>Conceived as a war game, chess was most likely invented in India
almost 1,500 years ago. It quickly spread to Persia, China and other
parts of Asia. About 500 years later it was introduced in Europe, and
then to the Americas.</LD>
<LD>   Chess is based on the idea of armies meeting in battle. The pieces
represent those doing battle and the board stands for the
battlefield.</LD>
<LD>   The Norton Simon Museum features a chess set made in India during
the 19th century. Each piece, carved from ivory, is like a tiny
sculpture. In this set, the kings (in the second rows) ride large
elephants, and the prime ministers ride smaller ones. On either side
are generals who command the camel brigade, cavalry and the elephant
brigade. Pawns appear as foot soldiers in the first rows of each
side.</LD>
<TE>   When chess was introduced in Europe, it was transformed into a
game of intrigue in the courts of kings and queens. The prime
minister was replaced by the queen (the most powerful figure in
chess), the camel brigade by the bishop, and the elephant brigade by
the castle or rook.</TE>
<TE>   Chess is often referred to as a "battle of wits." Players battle
one another with clever planning. The superior player captures the
other's pieces. Chess is about skill and power, but it is not a
violent game.</TE>
<TE>   You can see this chess set and other artworks that explore the
idea of battle in the special Norton Simon exhibition "To Do Battle:
Conflict, Struggle and Symbol in Art." Parents and kids can find
entertaining and educational activities at the Saturday Family Day on
June 29 from 2 to 4 p.m., free with admission to the museum. For more
information, call (626) 449-6840 or visit www.nortonsimon.org.</TE>

<LD>* This year in fourth grade, my friends and I never wore dresses,
skirts or anything pink. We played football and soccer with the boys.
One day, a girl called us names like "boy wannabe." My friends called
her names back, but I turned around and completely ignored her. It
helped a lot and by lunch I had forgotten all about it.</LD>
<LD>   --Madeline, Beverly Hills</LD>
<LD>   * I feel bad when people tease me because they can sometimes hurt
my feelings. When people tease you, you should stop, think, act and
review.</LD>
<TE>   --Carla, 9</TE>
<TE>   Granada Elementary, Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   * "Dork!" "Loser!" "Weakling!" Have you ever been called one of
these names? If you have, you've probably been teased before. Teasing
usually happens at schools, but it can also happen at sports and
other places. A person often teases someone else because they are
jealous and want them to become discouraged so they can be better.</TE>
<TE>   --Udo, fourth grade</TE>
<TE>   Fremont Elementary, Glendale</TE>
<TE>   * A lot of kids tease me. I don't know why they do it. I know I'm
as good as anybody else. But also, I am different because I don't
talk back and I'm a nice person. They say things like, "You're ugly,
bad at sports, clumsy, an idiot," and they call me names. Guess what?
I'm none of these things. They just want attention. I handle it by
not paying attention to them and telling them to stop. They will grow
up and not have any friends and be unhappy.</TE>
<TE>   --Elana, 9</TE>
<TE>   Warner Avenue Elementary, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   * Being teased is not fun. When I was in third grade I got teased
and made fun of for my reading. I sometimes came home from school
crying. It made me feel not special and afraid to try. People who
make fun of others do not realize how hard it is to take.</TE>

<HD>Drawstring Drama Nearly a Bum-Out</HD>
<DH>Lakers rise to the challenge in crucial game Sunday, but 2
players' shorts don't, necessitating a quick change</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the old sports saying goes: It's not whether you win or lose, but
whether your drawers stay put. Just ask the Lakers. In Sunday's
climactic Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, the defending NBA
champs were forced to battle not only the Sacramento Kings and the
howling mob at Arco Arena, but some busted drawstrings on their Nike
shorts.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant's britches snapped in the second quarter, forcing the
star guard to leave the game for nearly a minute. While teammate
Lindsey Hunter held up a white towel for cover, Bryant was obliged to
pull on a new pair in front of God, several thousand fans and a
national televisionaudience.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in the third quarter, Robert Horry suffered a similar fate
and had to perform the ol' switcheroo while Bryant was shooting free
throws. The same thing had happened to Horry in Game 5 of the series,
when he had to use tape to keep his shorts on.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, both players returned Sunday to help the Lakers
snatch a 112-106 overtime victory that put them in the NBA Finals
against the New Jersey Nets. Is Coach Phil Jackson considering
suspenders?</TE>
<TE>   Nike spokesman Scott Reames said the company has requested that
the pairs of shorts be sent back for inspection. Among the questions
Nike has is whether the shorts were new or had been worn by the
players for some time. "We're really scratching our heads as to why
this happened now," Reames said. "This could be a new batch where
there is a defective string."</TE>
<TE>   One sports marketing expert speculated about the drawstring
development.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm a weekend warrior or I'm in one of those lawyers'
basketball leagues and I've spent a little too much time behind my
desk over the years, and the elastic doesn't work for those [Lakers]
guys, what does that say about the reliability of a product?" said
David Carter, a principal at the Sports Business Group, which does
strategic marketing for the sports industry.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Monday sports story in The Times, the shorts in
question have two drawstrings, not one, each of which is sewn into
the back of the waist. "One tug and one or both sides can break free,
and the waist is not sufficiently elastic to keep them up," The Times
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Carr, editor of a weekly sports goods newsletter, expressed
surprise at the shorts' design. "I didn't even know they had
drawstrings," he said. "With good elastic, why would you even need
drawstrings?"</TE>
<TE>   An equipment miscue is no laughing matter in the high-stakes world
of sports brand-name marketing. Big companies pay millions of dollars
to get Michael Jordan to wear their sneakers or Tiger Woods to whack
their golf balls. Overall, Carter said, Nike has a strong reputation
as a leading sportswear manufacturer. But incidents like Sunday's are
embarrassing for more than just the players.</TE>
<TE>   "Athletes used to take the money and run," Carter said, "and now
in this case they take the risk of taking the money and stumbling
when their pants fall down."</TE>
<TE>   Carter then posed a hypothetical, if unlikely, scenario: Suppose
another busted drawstring caused a player to leave an NBA Finals game
at a critical moment. If his team went on to lose the game and the
series, Carter said, it could cost the losing team "potentially tens
of millions of dollars" in diminished merchandise sales and ticket
sales and concessions the following season, "if for some reason the
team were in less demand."</TE>
<TE>   That script may strike some as a bit too Heisenbergian. But Nike
stumbled several years ago when Olympics sprinter Quincy Watts had
shoe problems during a race--the sole of one of his Nike track shoes
came unglued and he finished in fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   So Just Do It. But remember to bring a safety pin.</TE>

<HD>A Look at Life by the Book</HD>
<DH>Rereading classics shows publisher how she's changed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL J. YBARRA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>A few years ago, when Wendy Lesser moved into a rambling Victorian
house down the street from the UC Berkeley campus, she spent two days
arranging her books. For Lesser, the editor and publisher of the
Threepenny Review literary journal, this was no casual task.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't live someplace until the books are in some kind of
order," she says. "I don't ever like to be without a book."</LD>
<LD>   Later, she still wasn't satisfied, so she rearranged the books.
Nonfiction ended up downstairs in the library, replete with a sliding
wall-mounted ladder. So did the novels that her husband and son might
want to read. Her personal favorites got shelved upstairs between her
bedroom and study, where the desk is as immaculate and well-ordered
as her books and prose.</LD>
<TE>   Then one day about three years ago, something unlikely happened.
Lesser couldn't find anything to read. She scanned her shelves and
pulled out a copy of Henry James' "The Portrait of a Lady," which she
had read twice before but had not looked at since her days as a
graduate student two decades earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The book turned out to be new and exciting in ways Lesser could
never have imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to be tempted to skip ahead," she writes in the recently
published "Nothing Remains the Same: Rereading and Remembering"
(Houghton Mifflin). "I now wanted to saunter through the commas,
linger at the semicolons, and take small contemplative breaks at the
periods. The book was much better than I had remembered it. More to
the point, I was a much better reader of it. Both pleasure and
understanding came more easily to me."</TE>
<TE>   After James, Lesser picked up another old volume to read again.
Then a third. She wanted to see how they--and she--had changed with
the years and soon realized there might be a book in the experience
of rereading.</TE>
<TE>   Lesser says the experience taught her something she never knew
before about literature. "Books change over time," she observes. "So
there's no point in making absolute statements about 'best' or
'favorite' or whatever, because time will alter these things."</TE>
<TE>   Rereading, for Lesser, also turned out to be about reliving. "I
learned a great deal about myself," Lesser adds. "More, I think, than
I would have if I had just tried to remember my youthful self without
the help of books."</TE>
<TE>   In a chapter about D.H. Lawrence, she writes: "What we read is an
aspect of the life we have lived, and shapes our subsequent life, and
becomes part of our memory of the past.... We should be willing to
allow our personal and historical responses to flood in and out of
the books we read ... the bringing together of books and life is
pretty much unavoidable, if you really want to immerse yourself in
the pleasure of reading."</TE>
<TE>   That last line pretty much sums up Lesser's biography: the
bringing together of books and life.</TE>
<TE>   She grew up in Palo Alto with her divorced mother, Millicent
Dillon, who later wrote novels and a biography of writer Jane Bowles.
Her father worked as an engineer for IBM but wrote on the side about
computers and sailing. "We were the weird family on the block,"
Lesser remembers. "My mother was a dance therapist and freelance
journalist."</TE>
<TE>   At 6, Lesser began devouring stacks of science-fiction magazines
that her father had left in the garage--a discovery recounted in her
1999 memoir "The Amateur," which is as much about the books she read
as the life she's lived.</TE>
<TE>   At 11, she read "Don Quixote," the first novel she tackles in the
new book. "I could not love Don Quixote more than I did at 11," she
writes, "but I can admire it more now."</TE>
<TE>   She went to Harvard and was about to go to law school at Yale but
took a detour to study English at Cambridge, which led to a PhD at
Berkeley. In 1980, while still a graduate student, she started the
Threepenny Review in her apartment. The review is still published
from the same apartment--a block away from the house she eventually
moved into.</TE>
<TE>   The review is a small but revered publication. Early contributors
ranged from a then-economics student at Stanford named Vikram Seth to
Gore Vidal.</TE>
<TE>   The current issue of the quarterly tabloid features a symposium on
W.G. Sebald, an essay by Michael Holroyd on the art of biography, a
movie review of "Mulholland Dr." and art by Curro Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted it to bridge a lot of different art forms, to be
somewhere between academic and popular writing," Lesser says. "We get
hundreds of manuscripts every week, and a lot are terrible. Every
once in a while we find a terrific writer. That's great."</TE>
<TE>   For the first decade, Lesser supported the review with second
jobs. In recent years the journal, which in a good year has 10,000
subscribers, breaks even, with about half of its revenue coming from
grants from institutions such as the National Endowment for the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to cry every three months when I had to pay the bills
because there was no money in the bank," Lesser says. "Some years I
still pay myself only $10,000. In a good year, the review will pay
half of my income."</TE>
<TE>   She spends about half her time putting out the journal (there's a
second paid editor and some part-time and free help) and the rest
writing on everything from dance to movies. She's published six
books, including the latest, the title of which comes from a letter
Mark Twain wrote. "Nothing remains the same," Twain observed. "When a
man goes back to look at the house of his childhood, it has always
shrunk."</TE>
<TE>   When Lesser had her Henry James epiphany and began seriously
rereading books, she even tackled some authors who had left her cold
the first time around.</TE>
<TE>   As an undergraduate she had trudged through William Wordsworth and
Alexander Pope without much enthusiasm. Thirty years later, she found
that she finally understood what the poets were saying, even though
she still wasn't smitten with them.</TE>
<TE>   "The paradox of teaching Wordsworth is that he cannot be taught,"
Lesser writes, "for there are moments in the 'Immortality' ode that
just can't be understood until you have been through something like
them yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Other works, such as Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams," that
Lesser had been looking forward to rereading proved problematic. "I
had too much of a personality clash with him," she says.</TE>
<TE>   There were, as well, disappointments. Lesser discovered that "Anna
Karenina" was a better book than she thought it had been, but the
passage of time also made its heroine less meaningful to her. Now
that Lesser is 50, with a teenage son, being a bad mother seems more
of a sin to her than when she was 20 and first thrilled to Anna's
consuming passion.</TE>
<TE>   "The book was still a terrific pleasure to read, and I relished
every second I spent with it," she writes. "But it was not the
life-transforming event it had been when I first read it. ... I
irrationally want her to have lived through the intervening
quarter-century with me, to have grown older and possibly wiser, to
have learned what it takes to keep a marriage going."</TE>
<TE>   Lesser's domestic life turned out happier than that of Tolstoy's
heroine. She met a fellow Berkeley bibliophile in a cafe and they
married. Her husband, Richard Rizzo, is a professor at Sonoma State.
Their son Nick goes to high school in Berkeley and works as an
editorial assistant on the review (and in his spare time recently
drew up a redistricting plan that he submitted to the City Council).</TE>
<TE>   "We're a big reading family," says Lesser, whose mop of curly red
hair is pulled back from her face. "We spend hours a day reading for
fun."</TE>
<TE>   Rizzo, however, isn't much of a book collector. "He doesn't care
as much about keeping books as I do," Lesser says. "He doesn't like
old books. He's allergic to dust."</TE>
<TE>   Then Lesser spots a copy of "The Collected Short Stories of
Hemingway" in her library and frowns.</TE>
<TE>   "This has got to be his," she says. "I can't stand Hemingway."</TE>

<HD>In a User-Friendly World, One Picture's Worth 1,000
Passwords</HD>
<DH>Image-driven log-ons are easier to use and more secure,
high-tech researchers claim</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Face it. Almost everyone suffers from a bad case of passworditis.</LD>
<LD>   Think, for a moment, of the slew of daily chores that require
passwords. The company computer. The home computer. Banking and ATM
machines. Web sites. Voice mail. Car and home security systems. It
doesn't take long to accumulate a dozen or more passwords. Scribbling
them down on Post-its or using the same password for everything is
how most people cope with the overload. Either way makes it easier
for hackers to invade computer privacy.</LD>
<LD>   Now researchers are moving toward what may be an answer to the
password conundrum--pictures.</LD>
<TE>   A number of companies, including software behemoth Microsoft, are
looking into various ways that images can be used to replace standard
passwords, which usually contain letters and numbers and are, more
often than not, easily forgotten. Pictures, on the other hand, are
much easier to remember. So researchers are developing picture
passwords that will make it simpler for the user and more difficult
for the average hacker.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, the screens available through a New York
company called Passlogix. One picture shows a wet bar. The password
is created by concocting a drink from the various items
pictured--glass, ice, vermouth, vodka and, voila, a martini. The
order the items are selected becomes the password. Another screen
might ask the user to choose elements from the Periodic Table in a
certain order. Still another asks the user to select a number of food
items from its "Make a Meal" screen.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at UC Berkeley who have studied the habits of computer
users say laziness plays a major role in most people's choices of
passwords. Most people have a tendency to use familiar names,
especially those of family members and pets, said Adrian Perrig, a
member of the Berkeley team. A poll conducted by the British domain
registration firm CentralNic found that 47% of all computer users
choose family names in passwords.</TE>
<TE>   "They pick the name of their cat or their dog and then add one
digit at the end if they think they're being clever," said Paul
Barrett, whose RealUser Corp. uses pictures of randomly chosen faces
as passwords.</TE>
<TE>   Another 32% of computer users choose sports, pop and movie stars,
as well as cartoon characters and team names. Only 9% employed the
more difficult "cryptic" passwords, those with the mix of upper- and
lower-case letters, numbers and punctuation that are recommended to
ensure security.</TE>
<TE>   And that, said Perrig, makes the majority of computer users easy
prey, particularly for hackers using programs that can run through
thousands of words in a matter of minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "They just try every single word in the dictionary," said Perrig.
"If you have a simplistic password, it will be in the dictionary and
can be found."</TE>
<TE>   And that's just the basics. Some hacking programs are so
sophisticated they use thousands of first and last names, then add
any number of character combinations at the beginning and end of the
root word to sniff out passwords.</TE>
<TE>   Forgetting passwords, however, is a more common problem of the
computer era than hacking, particularly for major corporations that
must maintain large help desks to service the company's computer
users--often around the clock. Estimates range widely about how much
it costs a company each time an employee forgets a password, but the
total is in the millions of dollars. Those who are pushing picture
passwords contend they will save companies money because recalling
images is much easier than the alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Perrig said 90% of people in a test group that researchers
evaluated were able to remember the pictures chosen from his Deja Vu
program even a week after the test. In contrast, only 70% could
remember their standard passwords. The reason, he said, is that
passwords must be precisely written every time, but pictures demand
only recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very good at recognizing images they have seen," said
Perrig. "People are not good at precise recall."</TE>
<TE>   And, researchers say, though far from foolproof, pictures are more
difficult for hackers to crack than the simplistic passwords most
people choose.</TE>
<TE>   Those experimenting with picture passwords are working on several
tracks. Perrig's Deja Vu uses computer-generated images that are
colorful and abstract. Microsoft is using an intricate picture, such
as the various parts of a human skeleton. Barrett's PassFace makes
the user recognize five randomly selected faces in the right order to
gain access to the computer. A new user goes through a five-minute
training session in which the designated faces appear on the screen
until they are memorized.</TE>
<TE>   "It works for everybody," said Barrett. "Only one person in 8
million can't remember faces. Once you know a face, you never really
forget it."</TE>
<TE>   There are downsides, of course. Rachna Dhamija, another of the
Berkeley researchers, said what people choose is often predictable.
She said if pictures are used, men tend to choose things like cars,
bridges and coins, and women lean toward picturesque landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   Another is the reluctance of businesses to move away from the old
familiar passwords to the new pictures. Mark Boroditsky, the head of
Passlogix, said his company decided to create a system in which only
one password is needed to unlock a program that will catalog all the
others. He said anything more difficult makes big businesses balk
because employees will require retraining. That means lost
productivity during training sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "A [traditional] password is very well understood," he said. "It
may not be the best, but it's familiar."</TE>

<LD>At first, I don't think Billy knew I lived in the Rogers' house, and
I'm sure he didn't know I liked to spend my days napping on the sofa.
If he saw me at all he probably thought I was a luxurious, white,
fluffy</LD>
<LD>   pillow.</LD>
<LD>   Then, one day when I was dreaming about tuna and cream, his ball
bounced next to me and woke me up. I opened my eyes, and meow! There
he was! Staring at me!</LD>
<TE>   My fur stood straight out like a frightened porcupine, and I spit
at him.</TE>
<TE>   Thhhhhh! But he didn't go away. He poked his wet nose right into
my face. Yuck! He smelled like dog!</TE>
<TE>   I stuck my claws out at him and yowled, me-ow-w-w-t! Get away! But
that stupid beast just wagged his curly tail and made an awful
arf-ing sound.</TE>
<TE>   What a dummy! And where were the Rogers? I needed a rescue team.
This monster was out of control.</TE>
<TE>   When I saw that no one was around to help me, I decided to make a
dash for it. I gathered all my strength, spit at him again,
threatened him with my claws and made my getaway. I scooted into the
dining room, jumped on top of the table, and there I sat--in the
middle, where he couldn't reach me.</TE>
<TE>   Prrrr-etty smart, don't you think? Anyway, I was safe for a while.</TE>
<TE>   I could tell the sound of my motor running--prrrr--confused him
because he kept flicking his ears, twisting his head to one side and
whining. What a ruckus he made! It hurt my ears. He finally quieted
down, but he kept staring at me. I mean really staring--like he was
planning something unpleasant for me. Now I wasn't purring! I was
scared.</TE>

<HD>The Get Up Kids Kick Up the Emotion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is emo necessary? Not the music, but the word, which seems like a
dubious category when the very best bands branded "emo" tend to
distance themselves from the term itself. The Get Up Kids are like
that, making passionate, melodic rock that owes much to the examples
of the Replacements and the Lemonheads, among many others.</LD>
<LD>   This stuff used to be known as indie rock. And equally (at least)
emo-tive music can be heard from the contemporary likes of Radiohead
and Coldplay. But whatever the label, the Get Up Kids epitomized the
most promising side of an accelerating movement Sunday in the first
of three sold-out nights at the House of Blues (following a sold-out,
unannounced show at the Troubadour on Saturday).</LD>
<LD>   The quintet, which emerged from Kansas City in 1994, opened with
"Let the Reigns Go Loose," a yearning, dramatic track from the band's
newest album, "On a Wire." Here and throughout the night, the band
revealed noticeably more muscle on stage than in the studio, without
losing any of the melodic richness of the recordings.</LD>
<TE>   Singer Matt Pryor slashed at his big Rickenbacker guitar, legs
planted far apart, as the band stirred real excitement both onstage
and in the crowd below. It could also be heard in the band's restless
noodling between songs, as if a mere set list was hardly enough to
satisfy the group.</TE>
<TE>   Lead guitarist Jim Suptic also sang a couple of songs, but there
was an added edge to Pryor's vocals even during the most melodic
passages, as he sang lyrics that explored endless layers of
self-doubt. "You're four years overdue," he sang. "What kind of role
model are you?"</TE>
<TE>   The Get Up Kids re-created the sound and sentiment of their music
with a blend of polish and spontaneity in a tight, 80-minute set. The
band's lineage may owe much to punk rock, but the expressive piano
and organ melodies beneath the guitars often edged it closer to Rufus
Wainwright than Joe Strummer.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the show, Pryor noted that the night marked the first
live rock experience of his baby daughter, and then described one
song as "what you can learn about parenting by not acting like your
parents."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the night's best material suggested the same blend of
memorable rock melodies and dark thoughts as Blink-182's "Adam's
Song," about teen suicide. It's easily Blink's most meaningful song,
but the Get Up Kids seem to have dozens of them.</TE>

<HD>Proof of What Happens When You Just Let Go</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID AUBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Part of writing a play is letting it go. It's both exhilarating and a
bit frightening when you turn your script over to the director and
actors who will try to make it live. It's a risk--you hope you'll get
lucky. With "Proof," I did. But when I let this play go I had no idea
how far it would travel.</LD>
<LD>   The play has been done in London, Tokyo, Manila, Stockholm, Tel
Aviv and many other cities; the definitive New York production,
directed by Daniel Sullivan, opens in Beverly Hills this week at the
Wilshire Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   "Proof" started with two ideas. One was about a pair of sisters:
What if, after their father's death, they discovered something
valuable left behind in his papers?</LD>
<TE>   The other, more of a visual image than anything else, was about a
young woman: I saw her sitting up alone, late at night, worried she
might inherit her father's mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   While trying to see if these ideas fit together, I happened to be
reading "A Mathematician's Apology," the memoir by the great
Cambridge mathematician G.H. Hardy. It's probably the most famous
attempt to explain the pleasures of doing math to a non-mathematical
audience. One passage particularly startled me.</TE>
<TE>   "In a good proof," Hardy wrote, "there is a very high degree of
unexpectedness, combined with inevitability and economy. The argument
takes so odd and surprising a form; the weapons used seem so
childishly simple when compared with the far-reaching consequences;
but there is no escape from the conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   That sounded like a definition of a good play, too. Math was alien
territory to me--I had barely made it through freshman calculus in
college--but I decided to set my story in Hardy's world. A
mathematical proof became the "thing" the sisters find; my
protagonist, Catherine, became convinced that she may have inherited
her father's talent--he was a legendary mathematician--as well as his
illness. With these elements in place, and feeling inspired by the
meetings with the mathematicians I'd begun to have, I was able to
finish a draft of the play quickly, in about six months.</TE>
<TE>   My first play, "Skyscraper," had been commercially produced
off-Broadway in 1997. Its run was short, but long enough for the
literary staff at Manhattan Theater Club to catch a performance. They
had invited me to submit my next play--a good break for me, since MTC
is the best venue for new work in the city. I sent "Proof" to them. A
few weeks later, it had a star, Mary Louise Parker, a director,
Daniel Sullivan, and an opening date for what I assumed would be a
six-week run.</TE>
<TE>   "Proof" has now been running for two years. In that time, I've
often been surprised at the responses it has generated. At a New York
University conference on the play, a panel of women mathematicians
used it to discuss questions of sexism and bias in their profession.
After a performance on Broadway I got a note from an audience member
backstage: "My daughter is just like Catherine," it said. "I can't
communicate with her. Can you help me?"</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, a woman confronted me after a book signing. She told
me her father had been a mathematician who'd lost his mind and she'd
spent her whole life caring for him. "This is the story of my life,"
she said. "How did you know?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer, of course, is that I didn't, any more than I intended
the play to speak directly to the concerns of female academics, or
could tell a stranger how to break through to his daughter. When you
let a play go, you also take the risk that it will take on
associations for people that you didn't intend and can't account for.</TE>
<TE>   That risk is the prerogative of art, however, and of the theater
in particular. The theater affects us more directly, and
unpredictably, than any of the other arts, because the actors are
right there in front of us, creating something new every night.
Something, as Hardy might put it, "Unexpected and inevitable." Which
makes it all worth the risk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Auburn won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2001. "Proof"
also won the 2001 Tony Award for best play; Daniel Sullivan won for
best director; and Mary-Louise Parker won best actress (play).</TE>

Hills. Tuesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2

removed the nation is from the attacks. As proof, the new Tom Clancy
thriller, "The Sum of All Fears," which shows Baltimore being nuked
by neo-Nazi terrorists, debuted at No. 1 over the weekend with $31.2
million in ticket sales.</LD>

<LD>The Playboy Festival's free concert at Santa Monica College's Corsair
Field on Sunday afternoon ran smack into the pregame anticipation of
the Lakers-Kings playoff final. As it turned out, the festival had
better luck than the Kings. There was a good-sized turnout for the
event (at least until the approach of the 4:30 tipoff time), and the
music offered a dynamic display of the eclectic programming that
characterizes Playboy's pre-festival free concert series.</LD>
<LD>   Singer Marlena Shaw opened the bill with a typically mixed bag of
blues and ballads. Charismatic as ever, she purred her way through
the slower tunes while triggering enthusiastic shouts of glee from
the crowd with her soul-stirring rhythm numbers. Listening to and
watching this magnetic artist in action, one could only wonder why
her obvious talents have never really received the attention they
deserve.</LD>
<LD>   Closing the afternoon, the superheated salsa band Orquestra Son
Mayor cranked up the temperature with its combination of brisk dance
steps, hard-edged horn riffing and seductive vocalizing. To its
credit, the group managed to hold a substantial portion of the crowd
well past the start of the Laker game.</LD>
<TE>   In between, the highlight of the afternoon was provided by
versatile saxophonist Eric Marienthal. Although his set was
thoroughly underpinned with funk and fusion rhythms, his soloing
ranged easily from smooth-jazz accessibility (including Kenny G-like
interaction with the crowd) to some impressive, straight-ahead bebop.</TE>
<TE>   Marienthal gave his players plenty of time in the spotlight,
triggering a flurry of snaps, thumps and hip swinging from bassist
Vail Johnson on "One for James" (appropriately dedicated to James
Brown), some high-speed finger work from keyboardist Hans Zenmuehlen
on "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy" and a stirring duet with drummer Joel Taylor
on "St. Thomas."</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds like a diverse set of tunes, that's exactly what it
was, and it was made even more far reaching when Marienthal tossed in
the funk rhythms of "Street Dance" and added a contemporized take on
Lennon &amp; McCartney's "Come Together." The entire afternoon reflected
the effectiveness of the free Playboy concerts in reaching out to the
Southland.</TE>

<HD>A Diverse South in 'Ya-Yas,' Nuance Beyond Caricature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Callie Khouri and I were finishing lunch the other day, an older
woman stopped by our table. She'd overheard us trying to make sense
of the South and its mysterious hold on generations of writers and
filmmakers. Her eyes narrowed, and the woman said, "You can't
possibly explain the South. The South just is."</LD>
<LD>   Khouri, a born-and-bred Southerner, nodded in agreement. "Well,
she sure is right about that."</LD>
<LD>   Directed by Khouri and based on two popular Rebecca Wells novels,
"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" chronicles the attempts of
three family friends to negotiate a truce between a wayward daughter
and her histrionic mother, played by Sandra Bullock and Ellen
Burstyn, respectively. With its plum roles going to actresses, it's
the kind of movie known as a chick flick. But it's actually something
more. It's a movie about the South, packed with all things Southern,
from its Jimmy Reed and Taj Mahal songs to its characters' hissy fits
and high emotions.</LD>
<TE>   "Ya-Ya," which opens Friday, is also one of the rare examples of
Hollywood traveling South and not subjecting the region to abject
derision, either by letting actors run amok with syrupy Southern
drawls or, as one of the Ya-Yas puts it in the film, "making us all
out to be a bunch of swamp-water, alligator-wrestling bigots." From
"Hurry Sundown" to "Mandingo," "Stroker Ace" to "Where the Heart Is"
and hundreds of movies in between, Hollywood has painted the South in
broad-brush colors, portraying most everybody as rubes and
simplifying its complicated history with paternal sermonizing.</TE>
<TE>   As a third-generation Southerner, I take the caricatures
personally. The South is a dense, often schizophrenic place: just as
full of idealism as injustice, just as easy to hate as to love. Its
prickly beauty has cast a spell on innumerable writers and musicians,
but it is all too rarely visible in humbug Hollywood films. As
Khouri, a woman known for her blunt manner, puts it: "The South has
been horribly maligned in movies. A lot of movies about the South are
like minstrel shows--all you see are those crazy Southerners with
marbles in their mouth."</TE>
<TE>   She sighs. "Put it this way, I'd rather stick pins in my eyes than
see 'Steel Magnolias.'"</TE>
<TE>   Khouri, whose script for "Ya-Ya Sisterhood" is based on an
adaptation by Mark Andrus, was born in San Antonio and raised in
Paducah, Ky. Like so many Southerners, she is someone who likes to
talk. By the time we finished lunch, the valet was bringing our car
keys to the table--everyone else had gone home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always ready to chew the fat," Khouri says. "I just find
people fascinating. Maybe it's my face, but people always tell me
their life stories. At the junket for our movie, the interviews would
be over and I kept saying, 'Where are y'all going?'"</TE>
<TE>   Khouri has a Southerner's fondness for grand language and
hyperbole. She calls her friend, director Jessie Nelson, "my oracle
of Delphi." Asked why she cast Burstyn as Vivi, the film's
tempestuous grande dame, Khouri explains: "She's just glorious to
look at. There's a light shining out of her, like the sun." She can
also be witheringly blunt, especially when speculating on reasons for
why the South has been so stereotyped.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I hear an argument about flying the Rebel flag over a
statehouse, I say, 'Dude, you lost the war 150 years ago. Let it go.'
Those are the things that allow people to think, 'Oh, Southerners
just must be stupid.'"</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of talk in "Ya-Ya Sisterhood," in which tirades
and recriminations erupt like summer thunderstorms. Khouri encouraged
her actors to turn it up a notch, as if they were in a quick-talking
Howard Hawks movie. "That's one of the problems with movies about the
South--people speak too slowly," she says. "The wit in the South
where I grew up was dry and sharp. No one spoke slowly, unless for
effect."</TE>
<TE>   So why does Hollywood rarely get beyond the cliches about the
South? "Hollywood has a very Hollywood idea of what the South
is--they don't get out of town very much," says director John Sayles,
whose new film, "Sunshine State," uses a north Florida beach town as
the setting for a knowing look at the deep-rooted tensions between
the New and Old South. "When they come to the South, they only see
the most exotic elements, not the everyday things."</TE>
<TE>   Sayles has visited Florida for years to see family and has even
written a novel--in Spanish--that's set in Miami. But before he
started shooting "Sunshine State," he gave his script out to locals
to check for authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   All too often, Hollywood's idea of Southern drama involves
1960s-era civil rights stories, but for many Southerners, black and
white, it's stereotyping at its worst, because racism can be found
just about anywhere. As Charles Burnett, director of "To Sleep With
Anger," noted in an issue of the Oxford American, a magazine devoted
to Southern culture, "Hollywood's mirror should be turned inward.
There are more racial problems in the Hollywood film industry than
anyplace in America."</TE>
<TE>   The South has other rarely explored conflicts, be it class
division or the differences between rural and urban values. "Have you
ever seen a comedy of manners like 'The Lady Eve' set in the
privileged South?" says Gary Hawkins, director of "The Rough South of
Larry Brown," a new documentary about the Mississippi writer. "You
don't see movies about the New South, with bankers or dot-com
executives. People in Hollywood have no idea how diverse the South is
today."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the best acting in Southern films has been done by
nonnatives; Robert Duvall, who is from San Diego, has played a
gallery of great Southern characters, in films ranging from "To Kill
a Mockingbird" to "The Apostle." But it's often difficult for
outsiders to understand Southerners' outsized personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "You find a lot of bigger-than-life characters in the South, but
as a filmmaker, your job is to get past the cliche," says "The
Rookie" director John Lee Hancock, who spent months in Savannah, Ga.,
writing the film adaptation of John Berendt's "Midnight in the Garden
of Good and Evil." "People come to the South and think, 'I'm gonna do
a circus movie with these big, bawdy cartoonish people.' But if you
look at a great film like 'Tender Mercies' [which starred Duvall],
you see a respect for the characters and the sense of place."</TE>
<TE>   The good films about the South capture a sense of place, whether
it's the foreboding Arkansas gloom of "Sling Blade," the spectral
Louisiana swamps of "Eve's Bayou" or the flat Texas prairie in "Hud."
"Ya-Ya Sisterhood" used North Carolina to double for the books'
Louisiana setting, but Khouri says, "Don't worry, we still had plenty
of humidity."</TE>
<TE>   "Ya Ya" delicately handles the issue of race, which lurks under
the surface in any Southern story, no matter how escapist. In one of
the movie's 1930s-era flashback scenes, the Ya-Yas stay at their Aunt
Louise's antebellum mansion in Atlanta, accompanied by Willetta,
Vivi's family's black housekeeper. Basking in the glow of so much
luxury, the young Vivi proclaims, "Isn't this just the most
magnificent thing that could ever happen?" Willetta dryly responds:
"I suppose that's what I'd be thinking if I was you." When Aunt
Louise's bratty son insults Willetta at breakfast, Vivi hits him in
the face with a plate full of eggs and grits, saying, "You shut your
mouth, you prissy little mama's boy!"</TE>
<TE>   Khouri is honest enough to acknowledge that the altercation, which
also appears in Wells' novel, is something of an idealized version of
white-black relations in the South. "When I was growing up, I had a
lot to learn," she says. "I didn't know any black doctors, all I knew
was black housekeepers, waiters and caddies. What I did learn was
that you could notice that you were racist and correct it. What
really scared me was that everyone could be so damn nice and polite
and harbor such deep hatreds toward other people."</TE>
<TE>   It's those sort of contradictions that make the South such fertile
ground for storytellers, especially the ones willing to see past
Hollywood cliches and get at the truth.</TE>

<HD>These Theater Singers Generate Bright Lights of Broadway's
Past</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the Tony Awards were lighting up Broadway on Sunday night, a
goodly number of Los Angeles' musical theater fans experienced a more
modest but no less entertaining taste of the Great White Way.
"Broadway at the Ford," at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, featured
the singing and dancing of veterans Carole Cook, Valarie Pettiford
and Sean McDermott, and rising star Tami Tappan Damiano.</LD>
<LD>   Like the Tony-winning "Thoroughly Modern Millie," this was a
program that tended to celebrate the Broadway past rather than
anticipate its future. But there's nothing wrong with that, given the
enormous treasure trove of material from which to choose. The
production efficiently moved the singers on and off stage, mixing
solo spots for each artist with occasional duos--notably Damiano and
McDermott's tender reading of "The Last Night of the World" from
"Miss Saigon."</LD>
<LD>   Cook relied on her diva presence, a bawdy sense of humor and vocal
skill to invest familiar items such as "Strike Up the Band" and
"Before the Parade Passes By" with the spirit and the tenderness of
Broadway.</LD>
<TE>   McDermott's soaring tenor and dramatic interpretation were
effective on "Hey There" and "What Kind of Fool," but he would do
well to reconsider his tendency to end every song by sliding off a
long, held note. Although Damiano sounded a bit brassy whenever she
reached into her top register, her versions of "Skylark" and "Night
and Day" were lovely, employing a warm middle register at the service
of sensitive, insightful readings.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Pettiford's superb singing and dancing that stole the
show. A Tony-nominated (for "Fosse") disciple of Bob Fosse, she
pranced sensuously through his choreography for "Whatever Lola
Wants," "Mein Herr" and "All That Jazz." Matching her svelte physical
movements with her rich, warmly engaging contralto voice, she offered
a brilliant display of the craft and the art that are intrinsic to
the American musical theater.</TE>

<HD>Once Again, It's Chris Rock Marion Barry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DE MORAES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Rock, the comedian who turned Marion Barry into a punch line,
will executive produce a TV movie for HBO about the former Washington
mayor.</LD>
<LD>   Jamie Foxx is ready to take the lead role on "Livin' for the City:
The Marion Barry Story." It's scheduled to start shooting around
Washington, D.C., and Baltimore in the early fall.</LD>
<LD>   Barry, who had just got his hands on a copy of the script late
Friday, blasted it as "outrageous," his spokeswoman told the
Washington Post.</LD>
<TE>   Contacted for comment, an HBO representative went into full "it's
not anything we're officially announcing at this time" mode, but
eventually acknowledged that the project, first reported in the trade
paper the Hollywood Reporter, is real, and that Rock is driving it.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Rock nor Foxx returned calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   But Rock announced 2 1/2 years ago, when Barry was a guest on his
HBO late-night program, "The Chris Rock Show," that he wanted to make
an HBO movie about Barry's colorful life. Barry's publicist, Raymone
Bain, said that Barry was aware of Rock's interest but that no one
from Rock's camp had met with Barry.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, Barry may have found out why.</TE>
<TE>   Bain called late in the day to say Barry had gotten a copy of the
script, which he had not yet read all the way through. What he had
read, however, "he feels is outrageous and disrespectful. There are
many inaccuracies in it; overall he's very concerned about this and
... he feels there needs to be a major rewrite and Chris Rock should

<TE>   Rock has already gotten a lot of career traction out of Barry, who
had served three terms as mayor when in 1990 he was videotaped by the
FBI smoking crack cocaine at a Washington hotel. He served six months

1994.</TE>

<HD>South Bay Cities' 'Evita' Seems to Be Going Through Motions</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine an entire musical performed as though the cast were following
footprints pasted to the floor to diagram their steps. That's how it
feels to watch Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities' revival of
"Evita." Everyone purposefully hits the marks, but with little
spontaneity or conviction.</LD>
<LD>   If there is any reason to see this rehash of the 1978 Andrew Lloyd
Webber-Tim Rice rock opera, it is to catch Christa Jackson's
performance as Eva Peron. As of Sunday, Jackson was pretty much just
going through the motions, projecting little of the complex inner
life of this woman who calculates her way to the top of turbulent
1940s Argentina, only to be betrayed by her dying body. But the
actress' electric voice--much-admired in last fall's "Always ...
Patsy Cline"--powered her along, especially in songs that allowed her
to punch toward the top of her register.</LD>
<LD>   To play the revolutionary who darkly comments on Eva's rise,
Michael A. Ross, who understudied the part during the show's national
tour engagement at the Shubert in the early 1980s, puts some bite
into his voice as well as his personality. Yet he, too, is just
skating along the surface.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the trademark mass-movement numbers--originally
choreographed by Larry Fuller, under Harold Prince's direction--are
better drilled than others. Still, they ignite this production's only
real fire. Wicked humor still crackles in the political game of
musical chairs and in the unruly tango-dance passion of Argentina's
working poor, re-created here by South Bay CLO stalwart Sha Newman.</TE>

<LD>   CBS Explains Trim of Tony Acceptance Speech</LD>
<LD>   CBS expressed regret Monday that it had to trim Elaine Stritch's
Tony Awards acceptance speech Sunday night--a move that caused the
77-year-old actress to fume backstage after winning in the special
theatrical event category.</LD>
<TE>   "We're big fans of Elaine Stritch," said Nancy Carr, vice
president of communications for the network. "We're pleased she
received the well-deserved Tony, and we're sorry that time
constraints made it necessary to move along."</TE>
<TE>   Stritch, whose "Elaine Stritch at Liberty" brought her her first
Tony after four nominations, cried out, "Please don't do this to me,"
as the musical cue interrupted her. And she was inconsolable
backstage.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to accept my prize with graciousness," she told
reporters. "I was anxious to tell the audience what this means to me.
But they rang the curtain down before the play was over." Asked if
anyone from CBS had called to apologize, she sneered, "In your
dreams."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the production pointed out Monday that all the
contenders were notified in writing that there was a one-minute
"guideline" for onstage remarks--a fact producer Gary Smith
reiterated before the show. A commitment had been made to stay within
the two-hour time-frame rather than running long, a la the Oscars,
the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour CBS telecast, meanwhile, registered lackluster
ratings. In much of the country, it was up against NBC's coverage of
the seventh game of the Lakers-Kings series in the NBA playoffs. The
Tonys drew an average of 8 million people--down 11% from last year,
which benefited from the popularity of Broadway's "The Producers."
Barbara Koppel's documentary "The Hamptons" averaged a mediocre 7.3
million viewers in the same time slot on ABC.</TE>

<TE>   Women Hit Celluloid Ceiling, Survey Says</TE>
<TE>   The number of female producers fell sharply last year, according
to a survey released Monday by the San Diego State University School
of Communication.</TE>
<TE>   "The Celluloid Ceiling," an annual event measuring industry
credits since 1987, assesses the number of female producers,
directors, writers, cinematographers and editors on the year's 250
top-grossing films.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Lauzen, a professor at the university, told Daily Variety
that little progress was seen in any area in 2001. Women accounted
for 17% of all executive producers and 25% of producers last year--up
1% in each case from the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The number of female directors, however, went from 11% in 2000 to
6% in 2001, while female writers fell from 14% to 10% in the same
time frame, the survey said. More than 20% of the movies had no women
in any of the categories analyzed.</TE>

<TE>   MTV Awards Go to 'Moulin Rouge,' 'Rings'</TE>
<TE>   In the 11th annual MTV Movie Awards, taped Saturday night for
broadcast on Thursday, Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring" and Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge" led the way
with two wins apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord of the Rings" won for best movie and for best breakthrough
male performance, for Orlando Bloom. "Moulin Rouge" was honored for
Nicole Kidman's performance and for best musical sequence.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners included Will Smith ("Ali"), Reese Witherspoon
("Legally Blonde") and Denzel Washington ("Training Day"). Paul
Walker and Vin Diesel were voted best on-screen team for "The Fast
and the Furious."</TE>
<TE>   The show airs on MTV at 9 p.m. Thursday.</TE>

<TE>   Springsteen's Album  to Hit Stores in July</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Springsteen says he and the E Street Band completed their
first full album together since 1984's "Born in the U.S.A." in a
relatively breezy eight weeks, which surprised him as much as
anybody.</TE>
<TE>   "I woke up one morning and I had a record," Springsteen joked
about "The Rising," his first studio rock album since 1992. The
album, set for release July 30, includes "My City of Ruins," which
Springsteen sang on the national telethon for Sept. 11 victims. All
but two of the 15 songs, he said, were written after that time.</TE>
<TE>   "The stories all happen in a post-Sept. 11 context," the
52-year-old rocker told Associated Press. While some songs "deal more
directly with it than others ... it's in everything in some
fashion.... It's more of an emotional feeling that I felt, and that I
felt was in the air at that time."</TE>
<TE>   On playing and recording again with the E Street Band, Springsteen
says, "It's a very powerful sound, just the intensity I wanted....
The guys are playing better than they did 15 years ago. There's a
confidence."</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   "Sounder" is coming back--with two of the stars from 1972's
Oscar-nominated original involved in the remake for ABC. Paul
Winfield, who played the father , will now play a teacher, and Kevin
Hooks, who played the boy, will direct the movie....Showtime has
renewed its gay-themed series "Queer as Folk" for two more seasons,
slated to kick off in March.... Bernie Mac has been signed to star in
the Dimension Comedy "Bad Santa" and to replace Bill Murray in the
Columbia Pictures sequel to "Charlie's Angels," Variety reported....
"Sister Wendy at the Norton Simon Museum" will have a free public
premiere at the Pasadena museum at 6, 7 and 8 p.m. on Friday. In the
one-hour film, Sister Wendy discusses her favorite pieces of art at
the venue.</TE>

<HD>Emerging From Shadows in Iran</HD>
<DH>Art* Although expression in the country is restricted by
taboos, two L.A. shows reveal a vibrant scene on the rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as contemporary art extends its global reach amid a
proliferation of international biennial exhibitions and art fairs,
artists who labor under repressive governments have a tough time
finding an audience away from home.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of Iran, the artists who have risen to the
international forefront--such as New York-based Shirin Neshat and
Minneapolis-based Siah Armajani--have long since emigrated from their
native land.</LD>
<LD>   In light of this situation, two exhibitions in Los Angeles offer
an unusual opportunity to see a slice of the contemporary art scene
in Iran and, more fundamentally, to discover that there is one.</LD>
<TE>   "Out of the Mist: A Panorama of Contemporary Iranian Art," at the
Don O'Melveny Gallery in West Hollywood, presents about 70 paintings
by 20 artists. "A Breeze From the Gardens of Persia: New Art From
Iran," at the Los Angeles Public Library's Getty Gallery, in downtown
L.A., comprises 81 paintings, collages, prints and calligraphic works
by 49 artists.</TE>
<TE>   Independently organized and coincidentally scheduled to appear at
the same time in Los Angeles, the shows make the point that Iran is
not quite the cultural desert or prison that some Americans might
envision. The works on view are far from the leading edge of the
international scene. Still, they come from a country where a growing
number of private galleries and a government-funded institution, the
Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran, actively promote artists'
careers and encourage them to express themselves--provided they don't
criticize the current regime or venture into forbidden territories of
politics, religion and nudity.</TE>
<TE>   "Iran is ruled by an Islamic fundamentalist government," says Homa
Taraji, who organized "Out of the Mist," at the O'Melveny Gallery.
"Whoever lives there has to abide by that. But as long as the artists
don't deal with objectionable topics, there is no problem."</TE>
<TE>   That isn't exactly an ideal climate to nurture art that accurately
reflects its social and political milieu, but artists find subtle
ways of getting around taboos, Taraji says. What's more, she adds,
government officials rarely look below the surface of the art.</TE>
<TE>   Paintings by Hossein Khosrojerdi, for example, portray figures who
are wrapped in bandages and soaked in mud, amid a dark sea of debris.
The scenes are shrouded in mystery, but they portray Iranians who
have had "an Islamic identity imposed on them" and are searching for
their Persian roots, Taraji says.</TE>
<TE>   Two works by Shahla Etemadi appear to be contemplative views of
the patterns and shapes made by light on water. They actually reflect
the artist's thoughts about a society that forbids men and women to
mingle in public places, Taraji says. Images in the paintings are
based on a curtain installed in the Caspian Sea to provide separate
swimming areas for men and women.</TE>
<TE>   An Art Scene Rises in Iran</TE>
<TE>   Working with Iranian contemporary art is a relatively new
experience for Taraji, an Iranian who came to Los Angeles in 1975 as
a graduate student at USC. Having earned a master's degree in physics
and electronics from Tehran University, she wanted to further her
education with a master's degree in computer science. She got a
summer job at Jet Propulsion Laboratory while studying at USC and
continued working there for a couple of years after finishing her
degree.</TE>
<TE>   Taraji had an airline ticket to return home on Nov. 6, 1979--two
days after Americans were taken hostage in Tehran. "My father called
and said, 'Just stay a few weeks until things settle down.' The rest
is history," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of going home as planned, Taraji worked in the fields of
aerospace and information technology in Los Angeles. But last year
she decided it was time for a change and began thinking about
becoming involved in art, a lifelong interest she had not pursued
professionally.</TE>
<TE>   "Something called me back to Iran," says Taraji, who hadn't been
there for 15 years and who had vowed never to return. To her
amazement, she discovered a flourishing art scene. "Ten years ago,
there were only three contemporary art galleries in Tehran; now there
are 40-plus," she says. "There are so many artists, the galleries
change their exhibitions weekly."</TE>
<TE>   She also discovered that the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran,
which maintains a major international collection of modern and
contemporary art built by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi during the 1960s
and '70s, had become an active advocate of Iran's contemporary art.
Moribund for a long time after the revolution, the museum has been
energized during the last few years by director Ali Reza Sami-Azar,
Taraji says.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a permanent collection that is on display and on loan
to other museums, though not to the United States because of fear
that it won't be returned. They also support the participation of
Iranian artists in international exhibitions," she says. The museum's
staff does not exercise curatorial control over these exhibitions,
but "they are willing to pick up the tab for travel, shipping,
insurance and related costs," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to "open doors for Iranian artists and help them get
the international recognition they deserve," she says. And that's her
new mission as well. She became the U.S. liaison to the museum and is
setting up a nonprofit foundation that will organize touring
exhibitions of Iranian contemporary art. "Out of the Mist," which was
underwritten by the museum, is the first public step of her
long-range plan.</TE>
<TE>   The museum also played a major role in "A Breeze From the Gardens
of Persia," at the library. Spearheaded by the Meridian International
Center--a nonprofit institution in Washington, D.C., that promotes
understanding through cultural exchanges--and underwritten by
corporate sponsors, the exhibition is a collaborative venture with
the museum and Tehran Arts University.</TE>
<TE>   To organize the show, Nancy Matthews, vice president for
Meridian's arts initiative, made five trips to Iran and visited
hundreds of artists. "We wanted to illustrate the theme that
contemporary art reflects Persian culture and to present a
cross-section of what's going on in the contemporary art scene," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Art Expression Blossoms Forth</TE>
<TE>   As word of her project got out, she was overwhelmed with
possibilities. "Everyone wanted to be in it," she says. The show she
selected features a diverse group of works that range from
traditional calligraphic and miniature paintings to
Western-influenced landscapes, portraits and abstractions.</TE>
<TE>   Taraji offers two reasons for Iran's contemporary art boom. "After
the revolution, the cut-off of Western-style entertainment made young
people pick up art as a pastime. There was a demand for more art
schools, and more schools opened. That helped. Also, after the
revolutionary spirit subsided, people began demanding a better
economy and social life and less restrictive Islamic rules. They
picked up art as a means of expression. In any country where there
are restrictions of freedom of speech, people find a way of
expressing themselves."</TE>

<HD>A Ballet Company's Modern Adventure</HD>
<DH>New dance elements bring fresh energy to the New York City
Ballet in a retrospective saddled with an 11 p.m. time slot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Set your VCR. In 90% of PBS markets, the latest "Live From Lincoln
Center" was shown last Thursday in prime time. But an overcrowded
schedule led KCET to delay airing this three-hour cavalcade of
contemporary ballet until 11 p.m. tonight. That's right: Final
curtain calls at nearly 2 a.m. on a weeknight--and no repeat.</LD>
<LD>   Titled "New York City Ballet's Diamond Project: Ten Years of New
Choreography," the telecast honors an ongoing series that has
commissioned 40 works by 23 choreographers. Host Beverly Sills aptly
calls the project an "adventure in ballet," and NYCB director Peter
Martins says it has become central to his company remaining "a
creative institution."</LD>
<LD>   Significantly, three of the seven choreographers showcased in this
compendium come from the world of modern dance, evident not only in
their talent for bringing new energies and vocabularies to the ballet
stage, but also in their ability to undermine cliches.</LD>
<TE>   In "Red Angels" (1994, music by Richard Einhorn), for instance,
the late Ulysses Dove alternates classical steps and torso
undulations, combative partnerships and sudden emotional
yieldings--plus supplying a fake-out ending that literally walks away
from the standard ballet finale.</TE>
<TE>   A male duet from Angelin Preljocaj's "La Stravaganza" (1997, music
by five composers) also flouts ballet norms, catching you off guard
through its structure (unity leading to abrupt isolation) and its
forceful, anything-but-classical movement language. The Tharpian
opening to the excerpt from Kevin O'Day's "Viola Alone" (1994, music
by Paul Hindemith) similarly provides a contemporary edge, but O'Day
quickly falls into the trap of throwing too many steps against the
music.</TE>
<TE>   Of the more conventional ballets, Lynne Taylor-Corbett's
"Chiaroscuro" (1994, music by Francesco Geminiani) creates an
abstract life-cycle with Jock Soto at its center. The episodes may be
too brief and the characters too undeveloped to realize her
expressive agenda, but the attempt generates a greater stir than does
Christopher Wheeldon's formulaic "Mercurial Manoeuvres" (2000, music
by Dmitri Shostakovich).</TE>
<TE>   At this early stage in his career, Wheeldon proves fresh and
original only in small-scale passages--breezy solos for Benjamin
Millepied, for example, and sculptural duets for Soto and Jenifer
Ringer. But director Kirk Browning can't find a way to shoot the more
problematic ensembles except from far away, so much of the
performance looks ineffectual.</TE>
<TE>   Like Wheeldon's work, the excerpts from Richard Tanner's music
visualization "Ancient Airs and Dances" (1992, music by Ottorino
Respighi) seem oddly familiar on a first viewing. But Tanner has the
advantage of better camerawork and the presence of the telecast's
major discovery: Janie Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Here and in Martins' "Jeu de Cartes" (1992, music by Igor
Stravinsky), Taylor triumphs over faceless choreography with
technical brilliance and a way of personalizing her steps that make
every passage memorable. "Cartes" also features accomplished dancing
by Millepied, Damian Woetzel and Nikolaj Hubbe, but it's Taylor's
game whenever she's in view.</TE>
<TE>   Martins fields an equally powerhouse cast for excerpts from his
stale "Them Twos" (1999, music by Wynton Marsalis), but here it's the
charismatic Hubbe in the sexless "Sex" duet and the ghostlike Darci
Kistler in "Loss" who remind you of how great a company New York City
Ballet remains under his directorship.</TE>
<TE>   Several times during the evening, Sills speaks of Martins in the
same breath as choreographers George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins,
and this ridiculous puffery masks his genuine achievements in the era
following the deaths of those two masters. Her overstatement is
seconded by the air time Martins gets here, not only for his
choreography (two of eight pieces), but also for his excessive
prominence in the taped intermission features.</TE>
<TE>   The best documentary segment comes at the end of the second
intermission, almost as an afterthought. But in explaining how new
works evolve and the relationship between a choreographer's vision
and the dancers' individual strengths and weaknesses, it proves far
more revealing and germane than all the Martins promos that precede
it.</TE>

<HD>New Geffen Gift Will Expand Playhouse</HD>
<DH>Theater* His $5-million donation is part of a fund-raising
campaign to renovate the existing Westwood site and create a second
stage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film and pop mogul David Geffen is giving a second $5-million gift to
the Geffen Playhouse--the Westwood theater company named after
him--as part of a capital campaign that aims to raise money to add a
small second stage and expand the existing 498-seat Westwood theater.</LD>
<LD>   Geffen's first $5-million gift was announced in 1995 at the
theater company's birth.</LD>
<LD>   The new donation will kick off a $15-million capital campaign, of
which $13 million is allocated for construction and $2 million for an
endowment, Geffen Playhouse producing director Gilbert Cates
announced Monday.</LD>
<TE>   If the remaining money is raised, the project would require a
15-month closure of the UCLA-owned Geffen, during which the theater
company's programming would move to a temporary venue.</TE>
<TE>   The target date for the beginning of the renovation is May 2004.
Ron Frink of the Los Angeles-based firm Ron Frink Architects Inc. has
been selected to complete the design.</TE>
<TE>   Cates said the company hopes to rent another theater in
Westwood--perhaps an empty building, a movie theater or a UCLA
facility--to serve as the temporary home of the Geffen productions
during the construction.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on behalf of Geffen, Geffen Foundation President Andy
Spahn said: "He's very proud of the critical success the playhouse
has had. David thinks the playhouse is important in producing good
theater, in its connection to a public university, and for
educational reasons." In a written statement, Geffen credited Cates'
"extraordinary artistic vision." The second, smaller theater will be
built in what is now a small parking lot on the east side of the
existing facility, with a separate entrance leading from an existing
alley. The theater will be on the second floor.</TE>
<TE>   Cates said the new space won't be a "black box," but he described
it in terms that suggest that style of theater architecture. It will
be an "extremely malleable" rectangular space with permanent seats
around two-thirds of the perimeter and additional movable seats that
can be arranged in different configurations.</TE>
<TE>   Although specific uses aren't yet known, among the uses suggested
by Cates are solo shows, cabaret, workshop productions and
rehearsals. The Geffen main stage presents a variety of new plays and
classics, sometimes with Hollywood talent in leading roles.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know any serious theater that doesn't have a second
place," Cates said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the existing theater will be renovated to better
accommodate audience members and backstage workers who use
wheelchairs. The floor will be replaced by one with a more modest
rake, eliminating stairs between the lobby and the auditorium. The
stage will be raised slightly, and the wings will be expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Seating will be staggered for better sight lines, and the
mezzanine will be extended for additional seating. Cates estimated
the new capacity of the existing hall will be about 540. Elevators
will lead to the mezzanine and to the new theater, and restrooms will
be enlarged.</TE>
<TE>   Center Theatre Group officials are also raising funds for a new
facility on the Westside--at Culver City's Culver Theatre, which has
been renamed the Kirk Douglas Theatre in honor of the actor's gift of
$2.5 million for the project, which is estimated to cost about $8
million.</TE>

<HD>In Ojai, Music as Epitaph</HD>
<DH>The annual festival presents late--sometimes final--work by
composers Beethoven and Shostakovich in a program looking for higher
truths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The concept of a late style is a romance and often a fiction. The
living define it from the work of the dead. Last thoughts remind us
that we have continuing ones. We romanticize them as being
practically messages from the beyond, knowing full well that they are
no such thing. Still, the power of the final works of a great artist,
such as the visionary late Beethoven string quartets, is that in
their great confidence they seem to overcome matters of style and
technique and point directly toward what we, awestruck, perceive to
be higher truths.</LD>
<LD>   As a theme for the Ojai Music Festival 2002, "last thoughts" lacks
the feisty enthusiasm for newness and originality that has been the
hallmark of this special musical occasion for more than half a
century. But it doesn't necessarily lack a sense of adventure,
especially when paired with "latest thoughts," the other aspect of
this year's festival, which took place last weekend in the Libbey
Bowl. Nor does it lack a spiritual dimension, and spirit seekers
somehow persist in this sublime valley, however inflated real estate
prices.</LD>
<TE>   The focus was, however, unusually narrow. In place of an orchestra
and the normal wide range of music, the main concerts on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday evenings were restricted to Beethoven's final
five string quartets and Shostakovich's last three, all played by the
Emerson String Quartet. Pianist Marino Formenti supplied the new, in
a recital Saturday afternoon that included premieres and recent work.
Sunday morning was diversion with cabaret singer Ute Lemper and
guitarist Eliot Fisk. At a symposium two days before the festival,
and continued in preconcert talks by the symposium experts on
Beethoven, Shostakovich and music from the Weimar Republic, the
nature of late style was explored.</TE>
<TE>   There are, of course, no broad conclusions to be made on how a
life is concluded. Beethoven's late quartets grasp at the unknown,
and even a century and three-quarters after the composer's death they
feel like exalted breakthroughs. The last works of Shostakovich, who
died a quarter-century ago, represent his tenacious clinging to life,
despite the indignities of dying.</TE>
<TE>   Maturity, moreover, is also a relative thing. Schubert's lofty
last works were the work of a composer just past 30. Mozart's life
ended in his 30s, as well. Kurt Weill died at 50; Beethoven, at 56;
Shostakovich, at 68. Luciano Berio, whose "Sonata 2001" was given its
West Coast premiere Saturday by Formenti, is 77, the age to which
Haydn lived. Is that a late work? We don't know. The music Elliott
Carter wrote at age 77, 15 years ago, is different enough from what
he writes today that it may eventually be termed early late or even
late middle.</TE>
<TE>   Berio's sonata, his largest work for solo piano, is a magnificent
example of what is probably late-ish rather than late music. It looks
back, as late work often does, but not nostalgically or
retrogressively. Berio has always been concerned with history, with
how we hear modern music with ears conditioned by earlier music. He
loves the bounteous complexity of layers of meaning. In the sonata, a
ringing, repeated B-flat, probably alludes to Ravel's "Gaspard de la
Nuit," as a noted pianist in the audience pointed out to me. But
those repeated notes also suggest mechanical Baroque music. Scarlatti
ticks through the sonata. But the repeated notes are also engulfed in
luscious thick sonorities that are part of Berio's own palate.</TE>
<TE>   In looking at late Beethoven, theorist Theodore Adorno found
discontinuity. Lives often end in the breaking apart, in
dissolution--this and that starts to go. And they often end in
disillusion. Beethoven, however, found from the breakups new threads,
new ways of connection. "Sonata 2001" encouragingly follows
Beethoven's example. It flows and gushes, wonderfully well written
for the piano, gorgeous in its sound, an encouragement that a new
century can build on the best from past centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Formenti's recital was, as his concerts always are, an inspiring,
thrilling event. This time he introduced each piece with an
entertaining Italian-accented stream of consciousness, at one point
joking that a problem with outdoor concerts is that they are so dirty
and here he was in his new Helmut Lang suit.</TE>
<TE>   The sonically unpredictable venue also made itself felt in the
newest music, the premiere of a piece by Hanspeter Kyburz, a Swiss
composer. The sirens of fire engines invaded the quiet ending of the
11-minute piece but didn't ruin it. The piano writing is too
imaginative for that, taking advantage of Formenti's dazzling
fluidity, riveting intensity and serene pianissimos. Still without a
title, it will reportedly be called "Freeman Variations," in honor of
the Beverly Hills patron who commissioned it.</TE>
<TE>   Other pieces on the program--Georg Friedrich Hass' "Hommage a
Ligeti" spectacularly pounded out on two pianos, tuned a quarter tone
apart; Olga Neuwirth's nutty sci-fi "incidendo/fluido" and Vykintas
Baltakas' even nuttier "Das Lied," with a prerecorded dinner party
played in the background--are works that Formenti has played in Los
Angeles before. But new to the West Coast were three small nocturnes
by Salvatore Sciarrino, the middle one an evocation of Venice with
barely perceptible sounds.</TE>
<TE>   The recital ended with Alvin Lucier's "Nothing Is Real," in which
fragments of the Beatles' "Strawberry Fields Forever" are played and
taped, the tape then played back through a loudspeaker inside a
teapot. The pianist raises and lowers the lid, changing the
acoustics. Formenti added a twist. Local strawberries were passed out
during the performance, to merge sound and taste. He is a natural for
Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   That visceral sense that Formenti brought to his recital, and the
sense of being part of the environment, was exactly what was missing
from the two Emerson concerts Saturday and Sunday. The playing was
exceptionally beautiful. Since appearing in the theatrical production
"The Noise of Time," the two violinists (Eugene Drucker and Philip
Setzer) and violist Lawrence Dutton now play standing up, while
cellist David Finckel sits in the center. By doing so it adds vigor
to an already vigorous ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Yet both programs seemed to be all about control over difficult
material and of overcoming the hindrances of playing intimate music
in an amplified outdoor space. On a cold, crisp Saturday night was a
huge program, which sandwiched Shostakovich's 14th quartet between
Beethoven's enormous Opus 131 and Opus 130 quartets, the latter
played with "Great Fugue" as finale.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday afternoon, in luminous light, was a concert representing
the last of the last for Beethoven and Shostakovich. Beethoven ended
with buoyancy in Opus 135 and the new Finale for Opus 130.
Shostakovich wrote himself a requiem in his final string quartet, a
string of six somber slow movements.</TE>
<TE>   The Emerson's playing never, in any of this music, lost
concentration. But it never seemed spontaneous either--life was
continued, not ended or transcended. Noble, democratic, high-minded,
ironclad, the Emerson lives up to its name. But the messier nature of
Ojai is a better job for Thoreau.</TE>
<TE>   Next year Pierre Boulez, Mitsuko Uchida and the Los Angeles
Philharmonic return to Ojai, along with mezzo-soprano Susan Graham.</TE>

<HD>'Cold Case Files' Opens With the Capture of South Side
Rapist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was 10 years ago on a chilly March night in St. Louis that one of
the most notorious sexual predators ever to stalk U.S. streets began
his reign of terror.</LD>
<LD>   The masked, glove-wearing man who would become known to police and
a terrified public as the South Side Rapist assaulted a young single
woman who lived alone. Afterward, he forced her to bathe to remove
traces of evidence, uttered a threat against reporting the crime,
then vanished into the darkness.</LD>
<LD>   The routine wouldn't vary over the next few months as the series
of sexual attacks in the area left police grasping for clues. "You
feel like a moron," says one officer. "You feel like you're not doing
your job."</LD>
<TE>   Then, as quickly as the attacks began, they stopped. The
authorities, who had managed to collect a DNA profile on the suspect
despite his precautions, still couldn't link the evidence with an
identity.</TE>
<TE>   Months went by and nothing was heard from the suspect; police
reasoned that he might have moved out of the area or been jailed.</TE>
<TE>   But in January 1995, a new wave of assaults began, and tests
confirmed that the South Side Rapist had returned to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation and its surprising conclusion mark the debut
tonight of "Cold Case Files" (9 p.m., A&amp;E), which had previously been
a sub-series of the channel's "Investigative Reports" program.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's "Files" is particularly powerful because it not only
includes interviews with the detectives who worked the case but also
with several of the victims, who insisted on coming forward. And then
there's the interview with the South Side Rapist himself: Dennis
Rabbitt, now serving five consecutive life sentences.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing his twisted logic ("I don't hate women; I love
women") and the effect his actions have had on his victims, you might
conclude that the prison term isn't nearly long enough.</TE>

<HD>NBC's Brian Williams to Report From India</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NBC promised it would send its top anchor-in-waiting, Brian Williams,
out on the road for reporting experience. His first such trip will be
a long one.</LD>
<LD>   Williams is traveling to New Delhi for a series of reports on the
tensions between India and Pakistan to air on NBC's "Nightly News"
starting today.</LD>
<LD>   The network announced last week that Williams, anchor of a nightly
cablecast shown on both MSNBC and CNBC, would replace Tom Brokaw as
"Nightly News" anchor in November 2004. Executives conceded Williams
needed the exposure of more high-profile reporting assignments to
prepare him for the job.</LD>
<TE>   Williams will report on how the conflict affects the war on
terrorism, and how U.S. businesses are affected.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also said Williams' cablecast will be shown exclusively on
CNBC starting July 15.</TE>
<TE>   NBC believes the show's ratings have suffered because Williams
could be seen several times a night on two different networks.</TE>

<HD>NBC Advertising Sales Set Record</HD>
<DH>TV: Surprisingly strong market allows network to increase
rates 7% to 9% from a year ago. ABC, Fox prices also exceed
expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an advertising market suddenly flush with dollars, NBC grabbed a
network record for commercial sales while even lagging ABC and Fox
Broadcasting were able to lasso advertisers for higher rates than
what network executives had hoped even a week ago, industry officials
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In less than three dizzying days, NBC sold $2.7 billion in
commercials for the TV season that begins in September. The top-rated
network, a unit of General Electric Co., sold more than four-fifths
of its advertising inventory and commanded rate increases of 7% to 9%
over last year, said Randy Falco, president of the NBC network. Last
year, NBC's advanced sales came in at just under $2 billion, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been at this network for 26 years, and I've never seen
anything like it," Falco said.</LD>
<TE>   Industry experts predicted that broadcasters will enjoy a
$1-billion infusion in advertising dollars over last year's total of
$6.9billion. This year's spike in spending could approach the record
$8.1 billion in advanced sales of commercials two years ago, at the
height of the dot-com spending boom. Broadcasters typically sell
about three-quarters of their overall inventory in May and June, in
what is known in the industry as the "upfront sales."</TE>
<TE>   The extra money in the market prompted the Walt Disney Co.-owned
ABC network and Fox Broadcasting to boost their rates while sales
were in progress Friday and Monday, network sources said. ABC, which
watched its prime-time ratings fall by more than 20% last season,
launched its sales Friday by asking rate increases of 4% over last
year, and quickly bumped that amount to 6% in several instances, ABC
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been the beneficiaries of a stronger-than-anticipated
market," said ABC's president of sales and marketing, Mike Shaw.
Advertisers embraced the network's family-oriented shows, such as a
new Tuesday night comedy with John Ritter called "Eight Simple Rules
for Dating My Teenage Daughter" and the Bonnie Hunt show "Life With
Bonnie," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The network is expected to haul in $100 million less than last
year's total of $1.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is expected to finish its sales today, earlier than most
industry experts had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "ABC's schedule is still very weak by most standards," said David
W. Miller, a media analyst in Los Angeles with investment firm
Sanders Morris Harris. "The story is that the buyers caved, and they
caved early."</TE>
<TE>   Fox, which also saw a decline in ratings last season, began its
sales Friday by asking for a 6% increase and quickly nudged that up
to 8%, said Jon Nesvig, Fox's president of sales. The network
finished the season second, behind NBC, among viewers 18 to 49, the
demographic most prized by advertisers trying to build brand loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   By 7 a.m. Saturday, after a frenetic 24 hours, Fox sold all of its
upfront inventory, amounting to about $1.3 billion, which is in line
with the network's total last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strategy was to hang tough and tuck in behind NBC," Nesvig
said. "NBC had a great year, and that allowed us to come along for
the ride. It's a sign of a strong market if you can move your prices
up as you go along. Momentum breeds momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Movie studios and car makers led the charge, the networks said.
Broadcasters also benefited from several new entrants in the upfront
market, including cell phone service providers.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, meanwhile, has been slower to close its deals than its
rivals. The Viacom Inc.-owned network is demanding rate increases of
more than 10%, said sources at CBS and other networks. Last year, CBS
also held out for higher rates and ended up selling $1.3 billion,
only two-thirds of its inventory, during the summer months. The
network anticipates $1.8 billion in upfront sales this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are going as planned," Joe Abruzzese, CBS' advertising
president, said of this year's sales. "The goal is higher rate
increases and higher volume."</TE>
<TE>   Smaller networks--WB and UPN--are pulling in rate increases of
15%, sources at the two networks said. The WB network, owned by AOL
Time Warner Inc. and Tribune Co., is expected to sell more than $560
million in ads. UPN, which is owned by Viacom, is on track to sell
about $250 million in ads, a network source said.</TE>

<HD>Airline Stocks Drop on Bad News</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The struggling industry is poised to suffer an
additional $6 billion in pre-tax losses this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Airline stocks fell sharply Monday after a spate of reports signaled
that the industry still is struggling from the decline in business
and leisure travel.</LD>
<LD>   The global airline industry is poised to suffer an additional
$6billion in pre-tax losses this year after a record $12billion in
losses in 2001 following the Sept. 11 attacks, according to the
International Air Transport Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The trade group, which is holding its annual meeting in Shanghai,
largely attributed the deficits to the industry's basic problem: a
continuing slump in air travel and the carriers' inability to raise
fares without further dampening passenger traffic.</LD>
<TE>   The third effort this year by U.S. airlines to hike leisure fares
failed over the weekend. Continental Airlines Inc., which led the
price hike by raising round-trip fares by $20 last week, rescinded
the increase after Northwest Airlines Corp. and some other carriers
refused to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Although good news for consumers, the aborted fare hike and other
negative news prompted investors to dump airline stocks on a down day
for the market overall. American Airlines parent AMR Corp. fell 62
cents, or 3%, to $20.33; United parent UAL Corp. lost 9 cents to
$12.10; Delta Air Lines Inc. tumbled $1.32, or 5%, to $24.93 and
Continental fell $1.22, or 5.5%, to $21.05, all on the New York Stock
Exchange. Northwest skidded 79 cents, or 4.7%, to $15.93 a share on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   AMR added to the grim outlook by saying the "significant" loss it
expects in the current quarter reflects "a slower sequential rate of
earnings recovery" than in the first quarter of this year. A key
culprit: a "disappointing rate of recovery in business travel
demand," the airline said in a government filing.</TE>
<TE>   The number of business passengers, who typically pay higher fares
and thus generate most of an airline's income, will still "likely be
20% to 25% below their peak levels of 2000," and the "decline in
business air travel has not yet bottomed out," according to a survey
being released today by the Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy
group for business fliers.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, which queried business travelers, showed 73% of the
respondents said "expensive air fares were an important or very
important reason for continued cutbacks in air travel during 2002."
As a result, more business travelers are booking cheaper leisure
seats, even though they typically require reservations well in
advance of flying, the survey said.</TE>
<TE>   Business travelers on average now book 10.2 days in advance, and
they "indicated they would be willing to purchase tickets even
further in advance if they were offered more affordable air fares
that did not include the onerous Saturday-night-stay requirement,"
the survey said.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Case Focuses on Intent</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury may begin deliberations this week. Final
defense witness takes the stand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Defense attorneys called their final witness Monday in the Arthur
Andersen trial, once again hammering at the theme that the accounting
firm had no criminal intent when it shredded Enron Corp. audit
documents.</LD>
<LD>   The last witness, San Diego-based partner John Riley, testified he
didn't believe regulators' informal inquiry of Enron would result in
Andersen having to turn over its own paperwork. The testimony from
Riley, the firm's Securities and Exchange Commission expert, appeared
to undermine a key prosecution point: that Andersen executives had a
motive to shred because they feared SEC scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   But like several of the firm's witnesses during its six-day
defense case, Riley's testimony appeared to cut several ways.</LD>
<TE>   Riley testified that, during a visit to Andersen's Houston office
in October, he heard the whine of a shredder and expressed his
concerns to David B. Duncan, Andersen's lead partner on the Enron
audit team.</TE>
<TE>   "This wouldn't be the best time in the world for you guys to be
shredding a bunch of stuff," Riley testified he told Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   Riley said Duncan replied that only confidential client
information was being destroyed as part of routine clean up. "It
sounded like it was OK to me," Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   That aspect of his testimony appeared to support the prosecution's
contention that senior Andersen executives knew of the destruction at
a time when they had an expectation that Andersen would be the
subject of civil litigation, if not an SEC probe, for its role in
Enron's meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen lead attorney Rusty Hardin said outside of court that the
disclosure of the exchange with Duncan "doesn't concern me." He said
Riley was simply sensitive to public perception. "He didn't think
anything was improper about shredding per se."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is charged with one count of obstruction of justice for
destroying documents and e-mails related to its Enron audit work.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are expected to continue their cross-examination of
Riley today, and the case will likely go to the jury before the end
of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors spent much of the last month trying to tell, in broad
strokes, a tale of rising fears within Andersen that Enron's collapse
would trigger a regulatory inquiry and a court finding that the
accounting firm had violated the terms of an agreement it entered to
settle allegations of accounting fraud stemming from botched audits
of Waste Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen suddenly began reminding executives of its
document-retention policy in the fall, according to the prosecution
theory, as a code to start destroying incriminating files.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's defense team hasn't so much told a story as it has hit
on a set of themes that could weaken the underpinnings of the
prosecution case. Even before Andersen presented its case-in-chief,
Hardin at every turn has taken pains to point out that the
potentially damaging Andersen notes, e-mails and memoranda introduced
by prosecutors as evidence of the firm's rising anxiety were all
retained--not destroyed--by the firm and turned over to investigators
under subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Hardin has elicited testimony that many of the e-mails
and files tossed out had no bearing on Enron at all but instead
included fantasy football league rules and other personal items.</TE>
<TE>   The volume of paperwork destroyed is irrelevant in determining
whether a defendant broke the law. But the evidence presented by the
firm is designed to show that Andersen lacked the criminal intent
required in order for the jury to convict. During the last six days
in court, the firm has presented witnesses who insisted they were not
thinking about a possible SEC inquiry at the time they shredded
Enron-related files.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the witnesses had received instructions last October to
comply with the firm's document policy, but several offered sharply
divergent interpretations of the rules, with some reading it as a
message to save, not destroy, drafts and other papers deemed
unnecessary for an audit.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest question still dogging the defense team is
what prompted Andersen officials last October to suddenly begin
promoting the internal document retention policy, which calls for the
disposal of unwanted audit material.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, the government's chief witness, testified that an Oct. 12
e-mail referencing the policy was part of what motivated him to order
his subordinates, 11 days later, to comply with the policy--a move he
said he knew would result in the destruction of some documents.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that an Andersen in-house attorney, Nancy
Temple, sent the e-mail as a coded signal to start shredding files to
thwart the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's lawyers have hinted at a number of possible alternate
motives. One Andersen witness, former Duncan assistant Shannon
Adlong, testified that her boss told her the files needed to be
organized because superiors from Chicago might be coming to weigh in
on the emerging Enron crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination from Assistant U.S. Atty. Samuel Buell on
Monday, Adlong conceded that she had said in a civil deposition that
the Oct. 12 e-mail was the reason. And Riley, under
cross-examination, testified that Andersen's senior executives had
not yet begun discussing a visit to the Houston office on Oct. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also has suggested that Temple sent the e-mail as a
directive to the firm's Enron auditors to properly document a series
of disagreements they had with the firm's internal
accounting-standards group. But that doesn't explain why partners in
Houston sent similar instructions about the policy to Enron team
members in Portland, Ore., and London.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Hardin for the first time argued that the promotion of
the policy wasn't as unusual as prosecutors allege.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin displayed two e-mails sent by Enron audit team staffer
Melissa Durochez to other staffers in April and August last year
reminding them that they needed to comply with the policy. It was the
first introduction of such routine policy reminders since testimony
began May 7. The e-mails show Durochez sent reminders to other
staffers to meet the policy requirements after the first and second
quarters of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Adlong didn't receive the reminders.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T Revising $8-Billion Credit Line</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The loan terms require a higher rating than
Moody's gave it. Sale to Comcast would have been barred.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILES WEISS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp., after a credit downgrade by Moody's Investors Service,
said it's renegotiating an $8-billion credit line that would
otherwise prevent the company from selling its cable business to
Comcast Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The largest U.S. long-distance telephone company's loan agreement
requires AT&amp;T to maintain a credit rating of at least Baa1 from
Moody's to move ahead with the Comcast transaction, AT&amp;T said in a
filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moody's
last week cut AT&amp;T debt to Baa2, one level lower.</LD>
<LD>   Eileen Connolly, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman, said the company hasn't made
any borrowings from the lenders in question and could therefore
cancel the credit line to move ahead with the Comcast sale. She also
said AT&amp;T would have had to obtain a new credit line anyway because
the present financing commitment expires in December, around the time
the Comcast sale is slated for completion.</LD>
<TE>   "That is when we would be renegotiating the line of credit
anyway," Connolly said.</TE>
<TE>   The company disclosed the terms of the credit line in a filing for
its plan to sell 200 million common shares to help finance the
purchase of the 69% of AT&amp;T Canada Inc. that AT&amp;T doesn't already
own. In 1999, AT&amp;T agreed to acquire the Canadian affiliate by June
of next year.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based company is negotiating substitute financing
with a group of lenders, some of whom are affiliated with the
investment banks chosen to underwrite the sale of $2.25 billion of
AT&amp;T shares.</TE>
<TE>   The current bank financing expires in December.</TE>
<TE>   The underwriters for the stock sale include Credit Suisse First
Boston; Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.; J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.; and Salomon
Smith Barney Inc. The SEC filing didn't specify which investment
banks have affiliates negotiating to provide bank financing to AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   The credit line, as amended last December, includes banks such as
Citibank, an affiliate of Salomon Smith Barney, Credit Suisse First
Boston, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc. and Goldman Sachs Credit
Partners, according to a copy of the loan agreement filed with the
SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The loan documents stipulate that AT&amp;T will not effect "a
separation transaction" unless the ratings for its long-term debt are
at least BBB-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. The sale
of AT&amp;T's cable assets is included in the document's definition of a
separation transaction.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T is selling its cable business to Comcast in a transaction
worth $57.8 billion. AT&amp;T shares rose 12 cents to close at $12.09 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Auto Sales Decline 5.7% in May</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Auto makers reported Monday that U.S. auto sales declined about 5.7%
in May, falling well below industry forecasts and hitting their
weakest pace this year as shoppers eased spending on new cars and
trucks.</LD>
<LD>   But even as they reported sharp drops in sales, there was some
good news from major auto makers.</LD>
<LD>   General Motors Corp. said it was raising its earnings outlook and
Ford Motor Co. said it was setting its third-quarter North American
production estimate at a robust 940,000 vehicles, a 16% increase over
a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Still, GM, the world's largest auto maker, said its May U.S.
vehicle sales dropped by a surprising 12% while Ford, No. 2, reported
an 11.5% fall in sales.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, in the midst of a turnaround plan, has been dogged by
double-digit drops in sales every month except April so far this
year. But its cross-town rival GM has enjoyed mostly stronger sales,
buoyed by its strong new lineup of pickups and sport utility
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   With most all auto makers reporting, May's sales ran at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 15.6 million, lower than
January's rate of 15.8 million. Isuzu Motors Corp. will report May
results today, but its sales are too small to change the industry
results significantly.</TE>
<TE>   Most industry analysts had predicted that May auto sales of cars
and light trucks would come in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of about 16.8 million vehicles, compared with a robust 16.7 million
rate in the same month last year and a 17.4 million rate in April.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of cars built in the U.S., Canada and Mexico fell 10.3%,
while sales of domestic-built trucks fell 5.2%. Import car sales rose
4.8%, while import truck sales were up marginally.</TE>
<TE>   Major players including Honda Motor Co. and Volkswagen were among
those reporting lower U.S. sales. Honda's sales dropped 11%, while
VW's fell 6.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest auto maker,
reported its best month ever for U.S. sales, with a 3.6% increase
from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other high-volume auto makers bucking the downward trend included
the Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler, which saw U.S. sales rise 4%,
and Nissan Motor Co., with a 2% increase.</TE>
<TE>   GM said that while May sales were weaker than many predicted,
sales for the year so far are exceeding forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   GM said it expects second-quarter earnings of $2.50 a share,
excluding its Hughes Electronics Corp. unit. That compares with an
estimate of $2 a share. Including money-losing Hughes, GM expects
earnings of $2.40 a share for the second quarter, up from its
forecast of $1.90.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, due to continued cost-cutting and a strong sales
outlook, GM said it expects earnings of $6 a share, excluding Hughes
and special charges, up from its guidance of $5.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup Takeover Raises Ire</HD>
<DH>Banking: Advocacy groups will challenge the N.Y. firm's
acquisition of Golden State Bancorp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Community groups said Monday that they will challenge Citigroup
Inc.'s $5.8-billion takeover of Golden State Bancorp Inc., parent of
savings and loan California Federal Bank, on grounds the New York
financial giant does too little to help lower-income customers.</LD>
<LD>   The California Reinvestment Committee and the Inner City Press
group in New York each filed protests of the acquisition with the
Federal Reserve Board, the nation's chief bank regulator, and the
Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates S&amp;Ls.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Stein, associate director of the San Francisco-based
California Reinvestment Committee, which represents about 200 groups,
said the groups regard Citigroup as having the worst
community-lending record among major U.S. banking companies. Inner
City Press complained to the Fed of "pervasive anti-consumer
practices ... including interest rates over 20%" and deceptive and
excessive add-on fees at Citigroup's consumer lending subsidiary,
CitiFinancial.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the criticism stems from Citigroup's $30-billion purchase
of Associates First Capital Corp., the nation's largest sub-prime
lender. The Federal Trade Commission is seeking hundreds of millions
of dollars on behalf of consumers with poor or limited credit
histories who allegedly were victimized by Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup contends it has addressed the problems at Associates,
now part of CitiFinancial, in the two years since the acquisition. It
is phasing out a costly add-on to mortgages known as single-premium
credit insurance and has cut ties with thousands of loan brokers it
said didn't meet its standards.</TE>
<TE>   A Citigroup statement said the bank "has an excellent record of
lending to all communities," with "the highest standards of
integrity." Spokeswoman Christina Pretto said Citigroup "will work
with community groups to address any concerns they may have" as the
acquisition of San Francisco-based Golden State proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law requires banks to serve lower-income customers in
areas where they do business. Because bank mergers require regulatory
approval, takeovers present advocacy groups with opportunities to
wring pledges of better services from the financial firms.</TE>
<TE>   If the Federal Reserve requires hearings on the merger, it could
add months to completion of the Golden State deal, which was
announced May 21 and is an important one for Citigroup.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company, has
only about 80 retail banking offices in California. The acquisition
would give it an additional 352 branches, mostly in California.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to concerns over allegedly predatory lending practices
at CitiFinancial, advocacy groups contend Citigroup's Citibank
subsidiary has focused its efforts in California too heavily on
upper-income customers.</TE>
<TE>   They also express concerns that Citigroup's purchase last year of
Grupo Financiero Banamex, Mexico's second-largest bank, would provide
new opportunities for predatory lending. Citigroup has denied any
intention to take advantage of Banamex customers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite protests, the Federal Reserve approved the Associates and
Banamex deals.</TE>
<TE>   Spokespersons for the Fed and for the Office of Thrift
Supervision, which also must approve the Golden State takeover,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the FTC lawsuit, Citigroup is resisting government discovery
motions requiring it to turn over documents that are more than 3
years old and those relating to Citigroup's own loan practices.
Citigroup contends those documents are not relevant to the case, said
Joel Winston, a top financial-practices supervisor at the FTC.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup "has taken a number of positive steps" since acquiring
Associates, Winston said. "But we need not only to address what they
do in the future, but the injury caused by Associates' past
behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares fell 40 cents to $42.78 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Golden State fell 21 cents to $38, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Factory, Building Data Show Growth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing expanded in May at its fastest pace in more than
two years, while construction in April posted unexpected strength,
reports showed Monday, adding to recent evidence of a broadening U.S.
economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management said its monthly manufacturing
index rose more than expected in May to 55.7--its highest level since
hitting 56.7 in February 2000--from 53.9 in the previous month and
its fourth straight month of growth. Any level above 50 suggests
growth.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department, meanwhile, reported that spending to
build homes, offices and schools rose 0.2% to an annual rate of
$871.9 billion in April. March's pace was revised downward to $870.5
billion.</LD>
<TE>   The positive data were tempered by a drop in auto sales during
May, which economists said may signal growing consumer caution that
would dampen the pace of the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   The ISM index was driven higher by a pickup in demand for goods,
which could signal further strength in coming months. Although
factories continued to shed workers, they did so at a slower pace,
with industries such as furniture production and publishing hiring
workers. That could augur well for the May payroll report due Friday.</TE>
<TE>   After an 18-month slump driven by a record runoff of inventories,
factories this year have boosted production to meet increases in new
orders.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the improvement has yet to translate into new hiring or
stronger capital investment, which Federal Reserve officials have
said they want to see to ensure a sustainable recovery is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Until that happens, most analysts expect the central bank to keep
the key fed funds rate target --the rate banks charge each other for
overnight loans--steady at a 40-year low of 1.75%. But recent reports
show that the foundation for better business spending and job growth
is beginning to fall into place, some economists said.</TE>
<TE>   ISM's closely watched new orders index, a measure of pipeline
demand for goods, rose in May to 63.1 from 59.0 in April.</TE>
<TE>   Prices surged to the highest level since January 2001, driven by
higher energy and steel prices, the ISM report showed. The prices
index rose to 63.0 in May from 60.3 a month earlier. While
potentially inflationary, the rise in prices could give companies
much needed pricing power.</TE>

<HD>El Paso Executive Found Dead in Apparent Suicide</HD>
<DH>Energy: Treasurer Charles Rice suffered from health
problems. Firm's shares fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The treasurer of El Paso Corp., one of several energy-trading
companies reeling over questions about its accounting practices, was
found shot dead in an apparent suicide at his home, police said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the death of Charles Dana Rice was linked to the company's
recent financial worries was not known. But word of his death sent
shares of El Paso stock down $3.70 to close at $21.95 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street executives who dealt with El Paso said it was widely
known that Rice had suffered from heart and kidney problems.</LD>
<TE>   A neighbor, Donna Miller, said Rice was undergoing dialysis, and
she believed he was on a list to receive a kidney transplant</TE>
<TE>   Some El Paso subsidiaries are under investigation by federal
regulators for allegedly withholding capacity on a key pipeline,
causing natural gas prices to spike to record levels in California in
late 2000 and early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Rice had no role in the California price manipulation case, said
Harvey Morris, the lead lawyer handling the matter for the state
Public Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the body of Rice, 47, was found at his home in Houston
at about 1 p.m. Sunday. The cause of death was an "apparent
self-inflicted gunshot wound," said Joe Laud, a spokesman for the
Houston Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the company said it was deeply saddened by Rice's
death.</TE>
<TE>   Rice's death follows the Jan. 25 suicide of former Enron Corp.
Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who shot himself in the head while
parked in his black Mercedes.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso said last week that earnings for this year and next would
be below expectations, and that it would slash energy-trading
activities in half by cutting 300 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The energy-trading industry has been swept up in a scandal about
so-called wash trades, in which companies buy and sell energy at the
same price to pump up trading volumes and revenues. El Paso said last
week that it had not taken part in the sham trades.</TE>
<TE>   Rice joined El Paso in 1977, became director of the company's
planning department in 1992, director of the accounting department in
1996 and vice president and treasurer in 1998. He was appointed
senior vice president in 1999.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E, Calpine Say They Engaged in 'Wash' Trades</HD>
<DH>Energy: The companies say the transactions were not done to
manipulate the electricity market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trading arms of PG&amp;E Corp. and Calpine Corp. told federal
regulators that they participated in so-called wash trades, but said
the transactions did not affect their financial statements and were
done for legitimate business purposes.</LD>
<LD>   The two California companies were among more than 100 to file
sworn statements Friday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
about whether they engaged in "sell-buyback" transactions with the
same company for the same amount of electricity at the same price.</LD>
<LD>   Such sham transactions are seen as a way to falsely boost trading
revenue or the price of electricity posted by independent indexes
published by Dow Jones, Bloomberg and Platts.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the power sellers denied using wash or round-trip trading
in 2000 and 2001 in Western markets, but some attached qualifications
to their denials.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based Calpine said it participated in 31 wash trades in
2001 of more than 72,000 transactions during the year.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine said in its filing that the trades were not done to
increase trading volume or corporate revenue, to influence market
prices or "for any other illegitimate business purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The company said in a news release that it used the trades, with
unnamed partners, for risk management. The trades represented about
one-tenth of 1% of Calpine's revenue in 2001, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine's media representatives did not return calls seeking an
explanation of how a company might use such transactions to manage
risk.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E Corp.'s National Energy Group said it uncovered 12 wash
trades in 2000 and 2001 of more than 25,000 electricity trades during
those years.</TE>
<TE>   The trades were initiated by NEG's trading partner and represented
less than one-fifth of 1% of company revenue, said spokesman David
Mould.</TE>
<TE>   Mould declined to identify the trading partner.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these trades were designed to inflate our trading
volume," Mould said. "None of them were involved in market
manipulation."</TE>
<TE>   NEG said its trades were reported to Dow Jones, which publishes an
index of electricity prices.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine said the individual trades were not reported to any index
publisher, but Calpine said it could not determine if the trades were
included in a range of transaction prices reported to such
publishers.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources Inc. and CMS Energy Corp. have acknowledged
heavy use of wash trades, but largely outside of Western markets.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy Inc. also participated in wash trading, but said CMS
initiated the trades.</TE>
<TE>   Federal energy regulators sought the information on wash trades as
part of their investigation into possible market manipulation during
the California energy crisis.</TE>

<HD>Transmeta Wins Contract From HP</HD>
<DH>Computers: The chip maker will provide microprocessors for
the new Compaq tablet-sized PC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Upstart chip maker Transmeta Corp. edged out Intel Corp. and Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. to provide microprocessors for Hewlett-Packard
Co.'s new tablet-sized personal computer.</LD>
<LD>   Due out this fall, the tablet PC will let users scribble directly
on the screen and wirelessly share notes and files with other tablet
users in the same room. Called the Compaq Evo Tablet PC, the device
is expected to cost about $2,000 and use a version of Microsoft
Corp.'s XP operating system designed for such devices.</LD>
<LD>   With demand for PCs in the doldrums, companies such as HP and
Microsoft are coming out with smaller, more powerful mobile devices
in hopes they will reinvigorate sales.</LD>
<TE>   Most analysts say it's too soon to tell whether such inventions
will take off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to tell how well people will take to this," said Tim
Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology consulting
firm in Campbell, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Bajarin said such devices already are used in manufacturing and
health care to collect data but have yet to hit mainstream consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Santa Clara, Calif.-based Transmeta and Palo Alto-based
HP decline to specify how many tablet PCs they will make together,
the contract is a coup for Transmeta, which posted a $171-million
loss on revenue of $35.6 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   "This will give Transmeta a new lease on life," said Rob Enderle,
an analyst with Giga Information Group Inc. "This makes them the
predominant chip vendor for tablet PCs, where Intel is noticeably
absent."</TE>
<TE>   HP chose Transmeta because the company's chips are known for
consuming less energy, thereby creating less heat and extending
battery life, than those of its competitors, said HP spokesman Mike
Hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Transmeta shares rose 20 cents to $2.57 on Nasdaq. HP shares fell
24 cents to $18.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Judge Moves to Focus File-Sharing Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge took several steps Monday to focus the music and
movie industries' lawsuit against online file-sharing networks
Morpheus, Kazaa and Grokster.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, lawyers for the plaintiffs said they intended to expand
the lawsuit to cover the two principal figures in Kazaa--Niklas
Zennstrom and Janus Friis--as well as Sharman Networks, the company
distributing Kazaa's software.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said he wanted to limit
evidence gathering to a few core legal questions, which could be
decided later this year. He said he would not allow Kazaa to concede
defeat without responding to the plaintiffs' demands for evidence.</LD>
<TE>   Lawyers for Kazaa had tried to raise the white flag, saying the
costs of the lawsuit were driving their client out of business. But
Wilson ordered Zennstrom and Friis to give depositions to the
plaintiffs' lawyers this month.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Bridges, a lawyer for Morpheus owner Streamcast Networks
Inc., said Monday's rulings were important "because the judge
recognized the complexity of the case." He added that Wilson was
trying to "ensure that the parties would in fact be able to bring the
substance of the case to the court."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson also declined Bridges' motion to withdraw as counsel for
Streamcast. Although Streamcast hasn't paid its legal bills, Wilson
ordered Bridges' firm to continue representing the company until the
pretrial motions were decided.</TE>

<HD>Glitch Slams Knight Trading Shares</HD>
<DH>Technology: Erroneous sell orders for the firm's stock are
sent as software is upgraded. Nasdaq cancels the trades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Knight Trading Group Inc., a key U.S. stock dealer, on Monday said a
software glitch caused its computers to dump almost 1 million of its
own shares--trades the Nasdaq market later canceled at Knight's
request.</LD>
<LD>   The sell orders sent Knight's shares plunging more than 50% in
before-the-bell trading. The stock, which fell as low as $3, later
recouped most of the loss, ending at $5.92, off 43 cents, or 7%, for
the day.</LD>
<LD>   The breakdown occurred as technicians upgraded internal software
throughout the firm, said Chief Executive Thomas Joyce.</LD>
<TE>   A trading workstation that hadn't been updated sent out "phantom
orders" to sell Knight stock below the market price, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Two or three things you could never imagine came together," said
Joyce, 47, who joined the company Thursday and began work Friday.
"The stars misaligned."</TE>
<TE>   The firm successfully appealed to Nasdaq regulators that the 1,000
trades should be canceled. "It's our contention they are erroneous,"
Joyce said. "There was never a real order."</TE>
<TE>   He said the glitch did not affect Knight's trading activities for
its clients.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the phantom orders were sent to Island ECN, an electronic
trading system that matches buyers and sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq halted trading in the stock about three-quarters of an hour
before the 9:30 a.m. EDT opening bell, pending news. Trading resumed
at midday.</TE>
<TE>   Traders earlier attributed the stock's drop to speculation about a
possible federal investigation of the Jersey City, N.J.-based
brokerage, whose founder and previous CEO, Kenneth Pasternak,
resigned in December.</TE>
<TE>   Pasternak quit three weeks before Knight was fined more than $1.5
million for a series of violations, including failing to honor trades
at prices it publicly posted. It was the largest-ever penalty imposed
by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers for the violations
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Knight was ordered to pay a $700,000 fine to the NASD and
$800,000, plus interest, to its clients.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, the largest market-maker in Nasdaq stocks, has been
struggling with plunging trading volume amid the stock market's
2-year-old slide. It cut 8% of its staff in March.</TE>
<TE>   Knight had no permanent leader until last week when stock trading
veteran Joyce was named chief executive, replacing interim CEO
Anthony Sanfilippo.</TE>

<HD>Mortgage Rates Edge to a Six-Month Low</HD>
<DH>The 6.76% level is likely to provoke already surging sales</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mortgage rates have edged down to a six-month low, defying the
predictions of analysts and adding more heat to the already blazing
Southern California housing market.</LD>
<LD>   The lower rates will bring some first-time buyers into the market
who previously couldn't afford to buy a home. Other consumers will
qualify for a little larger mortgage than before, providing a
psychological lift and perhaps more home choices.</LD>
<LD>   But several analysts said the primary factor that will continue to
drive the Southern California market is anxiety--the fear of not
being able to get a home before rates rise or double-digit price
increases push desirable properties out of reach.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not sure the rate cut can do much more than what's already
happening," said Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the
California Assn. of Realtors. "I think it can only exacerbate an
extremely tight market with stronger demand."</TE>
<TE>   The reduction in mortgage rates in recent weeks has led to little
change in home loan applications so far. At Countrywide Home Loans,
for instance, the increase in applications was hardly noticeable last
week, said Stephen Brandt, senior vice president at the
Calabasas-based lender.</TE>
<TE>   "The average consumer is not aware that rates have come down," he
said. "But the people who call us are pleasantly surprised to hear
what rates are," he said. Of the rate reduction, he said, "I think
this can only have a positive effect on real estate and could
stimulate demand more so than what already exists."</TE>
<TE>   The average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages declined to 6.76% last
week from 6.81% a week earlier. The latest figure remains well below
the year-ago rate of 7.24%, according to Freddie Mac, a major
secondary mortgage lender.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly principal and interest payment for a $250,000 home,
assuming 10% down on a fixed-rate mortgage, fell to $1,460 from
$1,533 a year ago. The income needed to qualify for the same loan
decreased about $3,000 to $80,732.</TE>
<TE>   Low interest rates have provoked surging sales, driving the
inventory of homes for sale under $1 million in the Southland to
record lows. Sales in Los Angeles County grew 26% in April from a
year earlier and in Orange County by 32%, according to DataQuick
Information Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Activity has been strong across the country. Existing-home sales
jumped again in April to an annual pace of 5.79million units, the
third-highest level on record, according to the National Assn. of
Realtors. During the first four months of the year, new- and
existing-home sales beat last year's record pace by 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had widely predicted that rates would edge up by midyear
as the economy picked up speed. Instead, economic indicators have
been mixed amid disappointing corporate reports and stock
performances and growing uncertainty about global conflicts. Concerns
that rapid growth would lead to inflation have diminished for the
time being.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors are sinking money into mortgage-backed securities,
which offer higher yields than other fixed-income investments such as
money market accounts and certificates of deposit. That infusion of
capital has pushed down the cost of borrowing and lowered rates.</TE>
<TE>   But cheaper mortgages will probably provide fewer benefits to the
national economy than they did when rates dropped to a 30-year low
six months ago. Although sales of existing homes are expected to
remain strong on a historic basis, analysts do not expect them to top
last year's record pace. Moreover, the number of people likely to
refinance their home loans is smaller now, leading to a smaller
benefit for the U.S. economy from consumers with equity to spend.</TE>
<TE>   "The pool of people who are savvy and diligent enough to refinance
their homes at current interest rates is evaporating quickly because
of the boom that already has taken place," said Mark Zandi, an
analyst at Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Still, loan refinancings in the Southland remain ahead of their
strong pace from last year, adding a boost to the regional economy.
In Los Angeles County, such loans have surged 40% from a year
earlier, DataQuick said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, home equity loans, based on the prime lending rate,
have more than doubled in volume from a year earlier to $922 million,
Brandt of Countrywide said. Consumers have been borrowing against
their homes to bolster their savings or to pay off higher-interest
debts from credit cards, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts now predict mortgage rates will begin rising by late
summer if the economy continues to improve. They generally predict
borrowing costs will rise to between just under 7% and 7.5% by
December. Those estimates, though significantly higher than the
current rate, are well under the average of the last three decades.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is getting better, and while it continues to get
better, the Fed will start to raise rates," said Keith Gumbinger,
vice president at HSH Associates, a data firm in New Jersey.</TE>

<HD>Poised to Sell, Napster Files for Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Internet: Music-sharing service seeks protection as part of
takeover deal with Bertelsmann. Move is part of comeback plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN STEMPEL</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Napster Inc., the Internet music exchange service, said Monday that
it has filed for bankruptcy protection as part of the planned sale of
its assets to German media giant Bertelsmann.</LD>
<LD>   The closely held Redwood City, Calif.-based company listed
$7.9million in assets and about $101million in debt as of April 30,
according to papers filed with its voluntary Chapter 11 petition at
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   The filing is part of a comeback plan for 3-year-old Napster,
which became one of the Internet's hottest properties by allowing
millions of people to swap music online.</LD>
<TE>   Though wildly popular, Napster has been offline since July as it
fights a music piracy lawsuit by major record labels.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court in San Francisco dealt Napster a fresh
setback in March, ordering it to remain shut until it complies with
an injunction to block all copyrighted music.</TE>
<TE>   Napster failed to find enough backing to relaunch as a
royalty-paying service.</TE>
<TE>   "The extraordinary costs associated with developing the new
Napster pay service and defending against the lawsuits have depleted
[Napster's] available cash reserves" and could have forced Napster to
close by June, Chief Financial Officer Carolyn Jensen said in a court
filing.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann stepped in May 17 with $8 million to buy Napster's
assets. Napster owes Bertelsmann $91 million, court papers show.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Bertelsmann agreement, Napster was to voluntarily seek
bankruptcy protection and emerge as a wholly owned unit of Europe's
second-largest media group. The agreement requires court approval.
Bertelsmann declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Napster is seeking approval for $5.125 million of
debtor-in-possession financing from Bertelsmann, court papers show.</TE>
<TE>   Konrad Hilbers, who joined Napster from Bertelsmann as chief
executive in July 2001, resigned May14 after the company failed to
find funding to relaunch its service. He returned three days later
when Bertelsmann offered the buyout.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Fanning, who founded Napster as a college student in 1999,
will be the company's chief technology officer.</TE>
<TE>   Napster has about 18 employees, court papers show, down from about
100 earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Napster listed the Assn. of Independent Music of London, which it
said is owed $3.79 million, as its largest unsecured creditor,
followed by the law firm of Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, with
$2.14million, court papers show.</TE>
<TE>   The big recording labels that were arrayed against Napster include
AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music, Bertelsmann's BMG, EMI Group,
Sony Music and Vivendi Universal's Universal Music.</TE>

<HD>Water's Edge Project Faces Stiff Competition</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The office development has yet to sign on
tenants in a weak leasing market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gleaming glass-and-steel buildings nearing completion at
Jefferson and Lincoln boulevards are signs that the long-delayed
Playa Vista project near Marina del Rey is finally beginning to take
shape.</LD>
<LD>   But with no tenants on board, the Water's Edge project also is a
sign of the weak and competitive office leasing market on the
Westside of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The area's vacancy rate has almost doubled, and asking leasing
rates have fallen about 10% since Los Angeles-based developer Maguire
Partners and investor Equity Office Properties Trust announced the
250,000-square-foot first phase of the Water's Edge development. In
addition, the project must compete with several new and mostly vacant
office buildings, including one a short drive away at Howard Hughes
Center, and bargain-priced sublease space in established business
districts.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pretty much 180 degrees from where the market was when they
decided to pull the trigger [to go ahead with] the project," said
real estate broker Jerry Porter.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire Partners leasing manager Tony Morales said he anticipates
about half the complex will be leased by the end of summer.</TE>
<TE>   But with sublease space in Santa Monica undercutting rates at
Water's Edge by as much as 35%, Morales said the project has had to
lower its own rent and expectations. Monthly rents at the project now
hover around $3 a square foot--even lower for large, blue-chip
tenants--compared with about $3.35 when the project was unveiled in
December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just tough to compete," Morales said. Tenants "today are
saying, 'We have to be smart about this' and are trying to find the
bottom of the market."</TE>
<TE>   Even with lower rents, Water's Edge faces stiff competition, real
estate brokers said.</TE>
<TE>   When Porter at Cresa Partners surveyed the market for 150,000
square feet of top-class office space, he found 50 alternatives
between West Hills and the South Bay--and that didn't even include
downtown Los Angeles or the Burbank area.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Porter's largest clients, high-technology firm Symantec
Corp. and advertising agency Rubin Postaer, have looked closely at
Water's Edge but have made no commitments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's relatively expensive, new real estate in a market that's got
a lot of real estate," Porter said. "It's the very leading edge of
Playa Vista office development, and, as such, it's going to be pretty
short on amenities for some time to come."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby in Westchester, rival Arden Realty Inc. is marketing a
recently completed 12-story office building in its Howard Hughes
Center near the 405 Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Playa Vista, which remains largely unbuilt, Howard
Hughes Center features other office buildings and a shopping and
entertainment center.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very aggressive," said broker Nick Christensen,
referring to Arden Realty. "Arden will be competing toe-to-toe [with
Maguire Partners] for each deal."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the challenge for Maguire Partners is that Water's Edge is
part of the much larger and more complicated Playa Vista project,
which will mix thousands of housing units, a 100-acre office park,
retail space and schools.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants must be sold not only on the building but on the vision of
Playa Vista that is years away from completion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely part of their challenge," said Christensen, a
Westside real estate specialist at CB Richard Ellis. "They are
pioneering a new concept."</TE>

<LD>Imports through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach jumped in
April amid concern about possible labor unrest next month.</LD>
<LD>   Imports through the Port of Los Angeles increased 22% in April
from a year earlier; they rose 13% at the Port of Long Beach, the
ports reported, as talks between ocean carriers and West Coast
dockworkers entered a fourth week.</LD>
<LD>   Three years ago, longshore workers at both ports slowed down
operations when the two sides failed to reach an agreement in time.</LD>
<TE>   The rise in imports at the nation's two busiest container ports
came in part because importers are taking precautions against a
possible work slowdown, said Robin Lanier, executive director of the
West Coast Waterfront Coalition, an industry organization.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents
carriers and other terminal operators on the West Coast, and the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents about
10,000 workers, have been meeting since May 13 to work out a new
3-year contract. The current pact expires July 1.</TE>

<LD>The World Trade Organization agreed to step into the escalating
dispute over a U.S. hike in duties on imported steel, agreeing to a
European Union request for a panel to rule on the legality of
Washington's decision.</LD>
<LD>   The EU wants an independent panel to overrule the March decision
by the Bush administration to raise tariffs on steel imports by up to
30%.</LD>
<LD>   The panel could take up to a year to rule on the legality of the
U.S. tariffs and either side can appeal the ruling, but a decision by
the appellate body would then be final.</LD>

<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court will use a $145-million award assessed against
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. to consider putting new
limits on punitive damages.</LD>
<LD>   The case gives businesses a chance to extend a 1996 Supreme Court
decision that struck down a $2-million punitive damage award
concerning a BMW paint flaw. That case marked the first--and
only--time the high court has declared an award to be so large that
it violates the U.S. Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   The State Farm award stems from its refusal to pay $50,000 to
settle claims against policyholder Curtis Campbell, who was found
responsible for a 1981 accident that killed one man and disabled
another.</LD>
<TE>   The $50,000 equaled Campbell's policy limit.</TE>

<LD>Eight of every 10 flights arrived on time during the first four
months of 2002, the highest percentage in at least eight years, the
Bureau of Transportation Statistics said.</LD>
<LD>   Statistics show that 80% of commercial flights arrived within 15
minutes of their scheduled time. That's the highest percentage since
the current record-keeping system began in 1995, when 76% of flights
arrived on time. Between January and April 2001, 72% of flights
arrived on time.</LD>
<LD>   So many flights were on schedule because air traffic has not
returned to normal after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said Darryl
Jenkins, director of the aviation institute at George Washington
University.</LD>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $17 billion in three-month bills at a

billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.875%, down from
1.89%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.752% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,956.50, and 1.919% for a six-month bill selling for $9,905.20.</LD>

for one-year constant-maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. pulled out of Wingcast, its venture with Qualcomm Inc.
to produce telematics services in vehicles, the auto maker said.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means Wingcast will be dissolved, according to
Qualcomm, which owns 15% of the venture.</LD>
<LD>   Wingcast's 200 workers will lose their jobs.</LD>
<TE>   Changing technology and customer desires were the main drivers
behind Ford's decision, the auto maker said.</TE>
<TE>   Wingcast was based on cell phone technology. Ford is still
exploring services based on a wireless transmitting standard called
Bluetooth that lets a user's cell phone interact with a vehicle's
electronics system using radio waves rather than wires, eliminating
the need for costly on-board hardware or a separate service.</TE>
<TE>   Ford had hoped to make Wingcast service available on 2003 models.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Insurer St. Paul Cos. said it would pay nearly $1 billion, before tax
and reinsurance recoveries, to settle litigation over asbestos
coverage for Western Asbestos Co., which a St. Paul unit insured in
the 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   St. Paul said the settlement--one of the largest agreed to by an
insurer over asbestos--would cut earnings by about $380 million after
tax and recovering reinsurance coverage from other firms.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Paul-funded settlement calls for Western Asbestos, and
units of Western MacArthur that bought parts of that firm in 1967, to
enter bankruptcy and for St. Paul to pay the money into a trust that
will compensate victims of diseases caused by asbestos distributed by
those companies.</LD>
<TE>   The insurer's shares closed down 99 cents at $41.62 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Order to Monitor Viewing Habits Overturned</HD>
<DH>Technology: A federal judge reverses a ruling by a
magistrate judge that said Sonicblue must track users of its ReplayTV
4000 digital recorders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a victory for privacy advocates, a federal judge has overturned an
order requiring the maker of ReplayTV digital video recorders to
gather data about customers' TV-viewing habits.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came in a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by the
major Hollywood studios and television networks against Santa Clara,
Calif.-based Sonicblue Inc. The studios and networks argue that
ReplayTV 4000s enable piracy by letting viewers skip commercials
automatically and send copies of programs through the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   A federal magistrate judge had ordered Sonicblue in April to track
how its devices were being used, a ruling that raised the hackles of
privacy advocates.</LD>
<TE>   In overturning that ruling, U.S. District Judge Florence-Marie
Cooper based her ruling on procedural grounds, not privacy issues.
When gathering evidence for a lawsuit, she wrote in an order dated
Thursday, plaintiffs can't compel defendants to turn over information
that they're not already collecting.</TE>
<TE>   She added that her ruling doesn't extend to Sonicblue's
MyReplayTV.com Web site, which collects anonymous information about
the programs stored on customers' recorders.</TE>
<TE>   That information will still have to be turned over to the studios
and networks.</TE>
<TE>   Megan Gray, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, an online civil liberties group, said the order provides
"breathing room" for products that safeguard consumers' privacy. "It
gives other companies the ability to consider their users' privacy
without having to worry about whether a court is going to
second-guess them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott P. Cooper, a lawyer for the studios, argued that the
narrowly written order didn't provide any broad instruction to
manufacturers. By ordering Sonicblue to produce the consumer
information they'd gained from MyReplayTV.com, he said, the judge was
implicitly rejecting Sonicblue's privacy arguments.</TE>
<TE>   At issue was a federal magistrate's order instructing Sonicblue to
"gather all available information about how users of the ReplayTV
employ the devices, including all available information about what
works are copied, stored, viewed with commercials omitted, or
distributed to third parties."</TE>
<TE>   Although previous ReplayTV models had collected anonymous data
from users, Sonicblue officials said they'd never done so with
ReplayTV 4000s. By ruling that Sonicblue doesn't have to create
information about users, Judge Cooper saved the company from having
to write new software to monitor its customers, said Laurence F.
Pulgram, an attorney for Sonicblue.</TE>
<TE>   Pulgram said the entertainment companies still want the court to
order Sonicblue to police users and stop copyright infringements.
Scott Cooper replied that Sonicblue has the technical ability to stop
recorders from violating copyrights in the ways outlined in the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the ruling, Judge Cooper rejected the studios' request to
withhold from Sonicblue five categories of internal financial
documents, business plans and related material.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Aids SEC in Theft Cases</HD>
<DH>Regulation: The Supreme Court reaffirms the agency's right
to sue brokers who sell clients' securities and steal the proceeds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission can sue brokers who sell
client-owned securities and abscond with the proceeds, the Supreme
Court said Monday, reinstating agency power that a lower court had
stripped.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous ruling lets the SEC seek to recoup $343,000 that
former Maryland broker Charles Zandford stole from two of his
clients.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration had said a ruling for Zandford would
create a "serious gap" in investor protections and reverse six
decades of SEC practice.</LD>
<TE>   The high court's decision authorizes suits by both investors and
the SEC under a federal securities-fraud law.</TE>
<TE>   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said the 1934
Securities Exchange Act "must be read flexibly, not technically and
restrictively."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is "a win for investors," said F. Joseph Warin, a
lawyer who filed a brief supporting the SEC on behalf of the National
Assn. of Securities Dealers. "By the court speaking 9-0, it
emphasized that the type of behavior that was involved in this case
will not be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals had said the 1934 law covers
only wrongdoing that involves either "manipulation of a particular
security" or deception about its value.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is the Supreme Court's first concerning the SEC's
authority since a 1997 decision that helped the agency press
insider-trading cases.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt said the decision enables the SEC "to
continue aggressive enforcement action against brokers who abuse
their clients' trust in securities transactions."</TE>
<TE>   Zandford's lawyer didn't respond to a call requesting comment.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC suit was a follow-up to a criminal case in which Zandford
was found guilty of 13 counts of wire fraud and sentenced to more
than four years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal jury concluded that Zandford, a broker at Dominick &amp;
Dominick Securities Inc., victimized William Wood and his daughter,
Diane Wood Okstulski. The two gave the broker almost $420,000 with
instructions to invest it conservatively.</TE>
<TE>   Zandford bought securities for the Woods, then systematically sold
them, putting the proceeds into his own accounts. In some instances,
he wrote checks to himself from a mutual fund account held by his
clients.</TE>
<TE>   The issue before the Supreme Court was whether that conduct falls
within the scope of the Securities Exchange Act, which authorizes
civil suits over broker deception "in connection with the purchase or
sale of any security."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said the Zandford case met the definition because the sale
of the Wood family's securities and the theft of the money were all
part of a single scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Zandford's "fraud coincided with the sales themselves," Stevens
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said not all cases of broker theft are covered under the
federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The law doesn't affect a broker who simply steals cash from a
client account, with no security sale taking place, Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors in those cases would have to use other legal avenues to
recoup their money, including traditional state-law suits.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Dive as Investors Recoil</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: S&amp;P 500 is at eight-month low, and Dow falls
more than 200 points amid more corporate turmoil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Software stocks, energy traders, blue-chip issues--all took a beating
amid a general retreat on Wall Street on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Catalysts for the selling included news that Tyco International
Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski resigned amid a criminal probe
into possible tax evasion, new disclosures of sham transactions by
energy traders and worries about war between India and Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   The S&amp;P 500 index dropped 26.46 points, or 2.5%, to 1,040.68, its
lowest point since Oct. 1 and its steepest one-day slide since Jan.
29. Tyco, down $5.90 to $16.05, and its larger rival General
Electric, off $1.03 to $30.11, contributed 9% of the S&amp;P's decline.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 215.46 points, or 2.2%,
to 9,709.79, the lowest since Feb. 7. Only two of the Dow's 30
stocks, AT&amp;T and Procter &amp; Gamble, rose. The sell-off accelerated in
the final hour of trading, which analysts attributed to the Dow
having broken below the 9,800 level and triggering programmed
selling.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index fell 53.17 points, or 3.3%, to
1,562.56.</TE>
<TE>   The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks fell 13.08, or 2.7%, to
474.39 as small-company shares, which had been one of the market's
few strong sectors, continued to give up ground.</TE>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 has lost 9.3% this year after dropping the previous
two years. The benchmark hasn't had three straight annual declines
since 1939-1941. All three benchmark stock indexes have fallen for
five sessions out of the last six.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks fell Monday even after an industry report showed U.S.
manufacturing expanded in May at the fastest pace in more than two
years. The Institute for Supply Management's factory index rose to
55.7 last month from 53.9 in April. It was the fourth straight month
with a reading above 50, which indicates expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Since Enron's collapse, investors have grown increasingly
concerned that companies are using accounting practices to inflate
earnings or hide debts. Stocks also have been hurt by rising tensions
between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan and continued
violence in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of stuff bubbling, and much of it is sinister,"
said Mace Blicksilver, a money manager for Marblehead Asset
Management.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, owner of the second-biggest U.S. gas pipeline, slid
$3.25, or 23%, to $10.95. California may ask federal regulators to
probe allegations that the company tried to corner the state's gas
market during last year's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso fell $3.70 to $21.95. The largest U.S. natural-gas
pipeline owner said Treasurer Charles Dana Rice committed suicide
Sunday. The company last week cut its 2002 earnings forecast, halved
the number of energy-trading jobs and said it plans to sell $1.5
billion in stock to support its credit rating and reduce debt. El
Paso's shares are down more than 50% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Software stocks tumbled after Lehman Bros. analyst Neil Herman
reported there are no signs of a pickup in the software industry and
said the stocks probably will be "dead money" for at least the next
two quarters. He cut his ratings on six stocks, including BEA
Systems, which fell $1.12 to $9.64, and Veritas Software, which lost
$1.65 to $21.02.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, the biggest software company, dropped $1.49 to $49.42.
The Goldman Sachs software index fell 4.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar fell for a fourth day in five against the euro and yen
on concern that foreign investors are souring on U.S. markets.</TE>
<TE>   Against a basket of currencies, the dollar has lost almost 6% of
its value so far this quarter, falling a record four straight months
against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   The greenback fell to 123.80 yen Monday, down from 124.38 Friday.
The euro rose to 93.8 cents from 93.1 cents Friday.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phone company SBC Communications Inc. and online giant Yahoo Inc.
have teamed up to launch an Internet service that they hope will
challenge AOL and Microsoft Corp. for dominance of the dial-up
market. SBC and Yahoo plan to add a cobranded high-speed Internet
access service this summer. SBC is a leading provider of faster,
broadband service. The companies did not disclose financial terms,
but officials said SBC and Yahoo will share revenue from online
advertising and commerce.</LD>
<LD>   The service, called SBC Yahoo Dial, will charge $21.95 a month;
less for customers who order other services from SBC. Far more U.S.
households use dial-up service instead of high-speed access through
phone lines or cable modems.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of SBC fell $1.14 to $33.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Yahoo shares slipped 34 cents to $15.68 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<HD>Peregrine Says KPMG Told of Accounting Woes</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peregrine Systems Inc., which is being investigated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, said former auditor KPMG told the software
maker its books violated rules involving revenue recognition,
accounts receivable and stock options. KPMG had "questions and
issues" about several aspects of the accounting. On May 23, San
Diego-based Peregrine said it would erase about $100 million in sales
from the last three years after KPMG found it had inflated revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Peregrine named Gary Greenfield as chief executive to replace
Steve Gardner. Its shares rose 23 cents, or 17%, to $1.61 on Nasdaq.
The KPMG news came after the market's close.</LD>

<HD>Tyco Chief Quits Amid Tax Probe</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: L. Dennis Kozlowski's resignation ends the
career of one of the nation's most controversial CEOs. Firm's stock
plunges 27%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. Chairman and Chief Executive L. Dennis
Kozlowski resigned early Monday amid a criminal probe into his
personal taxes, ending the career of one of the nation's most
controversial CEOs and deepening investors' crisis of confidence in
corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   Kozlowski, 55, quit after a series of weekend conferences with
Tyco directors that began Friday when he told the board he was under
investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office for
possible evasion of New York state sales taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau confirmed the probe Monday, saying,
through spokeswoman Sherry Hunter: "We have a sales tax investigation
involving Kozlowski and others." Hunter declined to comment further.</LD>
<TE>   The probe may involve Kozlowski's failure to pay taxes on at least
$10 million worth of art purchases made through family trusts, the
Associated Press said, citing an anonymous source close to the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski's criminal lawyer, Stephen E. Kaufman, did not return a
telephone call. The company said the CEO resigned "for personal
reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Under Kozlowski, a confrontational, 6-foot-4, motorcycle-riding
executive, Tyco has been a deal-making machine: The company completed
more than 200 acquisitions over the last decade that turned it into a
conglomerate manufacturing electronic components, specialty valves,
medical equipment, burglar alarms and other products.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's sales topped $36 billion last year, up from $13 billion in
1997. Some analysts likened the firm to a smaller version of General
Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   But Tyco and Kozlowski for years have fought attacks by critics
who alleged that the company engaged in deceptive accounting related
to its acquisition binge, largely financed by debt.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting charges triggered a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation in 1999, but that probe eventually was
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kozlowski continued to stir controversy. This year, he
announced plans to split Tyco into four parts, only to drop the
unpopular idea a few months later, issuing a humiliating apology to
shareholders for even proposing it.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's stock, which has ridden a roller coaster in recent years as
bulls and bears battled over the firm's prospects, opened the year at
$58.90. It then plunged on news of the planned breakup. On Monday,
the collapse continued as investors pushed the stock down $5.90, or
27%, to $16.05 on the New York Stock Exchange, fearful of what
Kozlowski's departure may mean for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski's resignation also darkened the mood on Wall Street,
where investors this year have faced a torrent of scandals involving
misleading corporate accounting and other misdeeds by managers. The
Dow industrial average slumped 215.46 points, or 2.2%, to 9,709.79,
lowest since February.</TE>
<TE>   In a predawn board meeting conducted by telephone Monday, former
Tyco CEO John F. Fort agreed to become interim chief while the board
searches for a permanent replacement.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation "is an issue for Dennis personally," Tyco
spokesman J. Brad McGee said. "Based on everything we know, there is
no connection whatsoever" to the company itself, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fort, in an effort to calm investors, said he is committed to the
recently announced plan to use an initial public stock offering of
Tyco's financial services unit, CIT Group, to raise money to pay off
some of Tyco's heavy debt.</TE>
<TE>   Fort also said, "I fully support the evolution of the company's
long-term operating strategy to focus more on organic growth."</TE>
<TE>   One longtime critic of Tyco, Dallas-based money manager David
Tice, said Monday that Tyco has been shown to be "an assemblage of
slow-growing businesses that were masquerading as a fast-growth
business through acquisitions and charge-offs."</TE>
<TE>   One of many Tyco controversies under Kozlowski was the firm's 1997
decision to move its legal headquarters to Bermuda to save on
corporate taxes. Tyco maintains its executive offices in Exeter,
N.H., where Kozlowski has a home.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's offshore status has drawn increasing criticism, especially
since Connecticut-based hardware maker Stanley Works announced this
year that it too would move to Bermuda. On Monday, Connecticut's
attorney general called on the SEC to investigate Stanley Works'
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski's credibility was hurt in February when a company filing
with the SEC disclosed that he had netted at least $330 million since
July 1999 on large sales of company stock. Kozlowski had long
maintained that he seldom sold personal shares.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski was among America's best-paid executives, last year
taking home a package worth about $125 million, including $10 million
in salary, bonus and other compensation and $30.3 million in
restricted stock awards, plus 1.4 million stock options worth
$85million at Tyco's year-end price.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Tyco said Kozlowski's resignation voided his contract,
which had spelled out terms for severance pay. Instead, Kozlowski and
the board "agreed to enter into good-faith negotiations" to arrive at
a new severance package, spokesman McGee said.</TE>
<TE>   His original severance package was worth more than $100 million
last year, when the company's stock traded mostly above $40.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said Kozlowski's fall and news of the probe into his
taxes will intensify investors' distrust of corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   "In some sense, it doesn't even shock anymore, and that's the most
damaging thing about these constant revelations," said Robert P.
Lawry, director of the Center for Professional Ethics at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland. "It hurts us in a larger sense
because we lose confidence in these [scandals'] being once-in-a-while
matters and worry that they're all-the-time matters."</TE>
<TE>   "It's demoralizing for the people working at the lower levels of
an organization--on the shop floor, in the managerial ranks--to see
the people at the top who receive huge financial rewards use the
prerogatives of power to play fast and loose with the law," said
James Fisher, director of the Emerson Center for Business Ethics at
St. Louis University.</TE>

<HD>USA Interactive Bids for 3 Net Firms</HD>
<DH>E-commerce: Firm already owns majority stakes in Expedia,
Ticketmaster and Hotels.com. Some shareholders sue, saying the offers
are too low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an aggressive bet after the dot-com bust, the interactive unit of
Barry Diller's media empire announced Monday a $4.5-billion plan to
take over three Internet companies in its quest to become the world's
largest e-commerce conglomerate.</LD>
<LD>   The unsolicited offers for online travel agency Expedia Inc.,
online entertainment hub Ticketmaster Inc. and discount lodging firm
Hotels.com expand USA Interactive Inc.'s push to take advantage of
the stock market slump and snap up companies on the cheap.</LD>
<LD>   USA already owns a majority stake in all three companies but wants
to consolidate its control and buy out public shareholders. Some of
those shareholders Monday sued USA and Diller, claiming the offers
were far too low. A dozen lawsuits were filed in Delaware Chancery
Court. One Ticketmaster shareholder accused Diller of trying to
acquire the company "without paying an adequate or fair price."</LD>
<TE>   Although USA's stock offer is valued at a 7.5% premium over
Friday's closing prices for the companies, it is below the stocks'
52-week highs. The offers were made to the various management teams
over the weekend. Executives with all three companies said they are
examining the bids.</TE>
<TE>   USA's push to pick up the trio of units is the latest in an
aggressive shopping spree that has spanned the last few months.
Diller recently spent $100 million in cash and stock for TV Travel
Group Ltd. Last week, USA Interactive agreed to buy Interval
Acquisition Corp., which books time-share vacations, for $578 million
in stock and cash. Acquiring the Internet groups outright will allow
USA to "begin acting in cohesive concert with all the parts of the
enterprise," Diller said. It also could help prevent USA's
investments from competing against one another. Although USA has kept
Hotels.com and Expedia separate, for instance, the two have rival
lodging businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The ideal scenario is to operate everything better together than
they would separately," said e-commerce analyst Jonathan Gaw of
research firm IDC. "You go to Expedia to buy a plane ticket, and then
you'll need somewhere to stay and something to do while you're
traveling. But the record for getting these elephants to dance
together has been mixed."</TE>
<TE>   Expedia--whose public shareholders own more than 45% of the
company--and Ticketmaster--whose shareholders retain about 34%--each
plan to form a committee to evaluate the offer. If the deals are
accepted as is, USA Interactive would have to issue about 156 million
new shares to complete the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Although the premium may appear to be generous, analysts predict
that Diller will have to sweeten the offer.</TE>
<TE>   "For all three of these companies, the bid is below both their
year highs and their 52-week highs," said David Kathman, a stock
analyst with the research firm Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders of Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster would receive about
$22.99 a share in USA Interactive stock under this deal, which is
below the 52-week high of $30 the stock hit in March. Holders of
Dallas-based Hotels .com would get about $51.48 a share, compared
with the high of $70.37 the stock hit in March. And stockholders of
Bellevue, Wash.-based Expedia would expect about $76.86 a share,
compared with the high of $84.65 in April.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Expedia shares rose $2.13 to $73.63, Ticketmaster rose
56 cents to $21.95, Hotels.com rose $1.16 to $49.05, and USA
Interactive fell $3.60 to $24.90, all on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The news came soon after Vivendi Universal and USA Networks Inc.
closed the merger of their entertainment assets, which were rolled
into a new company controlled by Vivendi and run by Diller.</TE>

<HD>Proposed Tax Hike Hits Casino Shares</HD>
<DH>Gaming: Illinois bill that would raise tax rates to as much
as 50% makes its way to the governor. Other states may follow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harrah's Entertainment Inc., Mandalay Resort Group, Argosy Gaming and
other casino giants tumbled Monday after the Illinois General
Assembly passed and sent to the governor a proposal to raise taxes on
riverboat casinos.</LD>
<LD>   A Standard &amp; Poor's index of gaming stocks slumped nearly 6%, the
biggest one-day loss since it fell 15.6% on Sept. 17, when U.S.
markets reopened after the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed Illinois law would raise tax rates on riverboat
casinos to as much as 50% starting July 1, according to the state
Legislature's Web site. The increase was higher than expected, and
wouldn't allow casinos to offset the rise in taxes by increasing the
number of slot machines allowed, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. George Ryan previously has said he supports the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that Illinois' Legislature sent such a signal to
businesspeople around the country," said Gary Thompson, a spokesman
for Harrah's, which owns two Illinois casinos. "No business can
sustain that tax rate."</TE>
<TE>   The move also raised the potential that other states could boost
casino taxes to help refill coffers depleted by economic weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Argosy, which operates a number of riverboat casinos in the
Midwest, including the Alton Belle Casino in Alton, Ill., plummeted
$7.03, or 20%, to $27.37 on the New York Stock Exchange. Another big
loser was riverboat operator Boyd Gaming, which fell $2.11, or 14%,
to $12.50 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah's shares dived $3.67, or 7.7%, to $43.98, and Mandalay slid
$2.10, or 6.4%, to $30.50, both on the NYSE. Among other gaming
companies, MGM Mirage dropped $2.46, or 6.5%, to $35.23 and Aztar
Corp. lost $2.13, or 10%, to $18.55, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed law would cut 2002 earnings for Harrah's, Mandalay
and Boyd Gaming by 3% to 8%, Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Brian
Egger said in a report. Argosy's 2002 earnings would be cut 14% and
the measure would be "substantially" dilutive to another riverboat
operator, Hollywood Casino Corp., Egger said. Hollywood's shares
dropped $2.53, or 19%, to $10.50 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   For casinos with gaming revenue of $25 million to $150 million,
state taxes would be increased by 2.5 percentage points. The increase
would be 10 percentage points for casinos with revenue of $150
million to $200 million. Casinos with gaming revenue of more than
$200million would see the tax rate increase 15 points to 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah's operates the Harrah's Joliet Casino &amp; Hotel in Joliet,
Ill., and the Harrah's Metropolis Casino in Metropolis, Ill. Mandalay
operates the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Argosy and Boyd, which also have casinos in Indiana,
suffered because investors are concerned the state may follow
Illinois later this week and increase casino taxes, said Lawrence
Klatzkin, an analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors, however, argued that higher taxes will make new
competition unlikely, ultimately boosting the value of existing
Midwest franchises.</TE>

<HD>Call an International Time-Out Over Kashmir</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. EVAN and FRANCIS A. BOYLE</AU>
<BD>William M. Evan, professor emeritus of sociology and
management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania,
is the co-author of "Minding the Machines: Preventing Technological
Disasters" (Prentice Hall, 2002). Francis A. Boyle, a University of
Illinois professor of law, is author of "The Criminality of Nuclear
Deterrence (Clarity Press, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clearly missing from all responses so far to the looming nuclear
crisis in South Asia is an argument for using international law to
resolve the conflict over Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   This striking omission underscores, on the one hand, the
widespread commitment to power politics and the use of war as a means
of resolving international disputes and, on the other hand, a
fundamental distrust of international law to resolve international
conflicts.</LD>
<LD>   As it happens, India and Pakistan both are parties to the 1899
Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes.</LD>
<TE>   The United States is also a party to this convention.</TE>
<TE>   Article 8 of the convention, which was the brainchild of the U.S.,
establishes a procedure for special mediation. Each state involved in
the conflict would choose a power, and those two powers would be
entrusted to talk on behalf of the conflicting nations. The goal
would be to prevent a rupture in peaceful relations.</TE>
<TE>   For the period of this mandate, which could not exceed 30 days
unless otherwise agreed, the states in conflict would cease all
direct communication on the subject of the dispute, leaving it
exclusively to the mediating powers.</TE>
<TE>   In case of a definite rupture of pacific relations, the mediating
powers were charged with the joint task of taking advantage of any
opportunity for peace.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government, joined by others, must formally and publicly
invoke Hague Article 8 against both India and Pakistan and demand the
required 30-day cooling-off period so this special mediation
procedure could take place.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government, joined by others, must also invoke the
requirement of Article 33(1) of the United Nations Charter providing
that the two parties to the dispute over Kashmir "shall first of all,
seek a solution by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation,
arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or
arrangements or other peaceful means of their own choice."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Charter Article 33 expressly requires the pursuit of the
"mediation" procedure set forth in Hague Article 8, including the
mandatory 30-day cooling-off period.</TE>
<TE>   Time is of the essence when it comes to invoking Hague Article 8
and averting a nuclear war.</TE>

Third World" (Brookings Institution, 1979).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strange as it may seem, a little nuclear saber-rattling over the
Kashmir conflict may be a good thing. During the last two weeks, the
leaders of India and Pakistan have brandished their nuclear-tipped
missiles and made veiled threats to use them. Pakistan President
Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee have
felt compelled to look and act fearsome.</LD>
<LD>   Like animals that show their fangs or inflate themselves with air
to appear more menacing to adversaries, both men have resorted to
this hallowed ritual of political rivals, which more often than not
has prevented a deadly showdown.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the U.S., Britain, Russia and China have warned of a
possible 12 million immediate deaths in a nuclear exchange. India's
nuclear force is substantially larger than Pakistan's, though each
has the capacity to destroy one another's capital. To underscore
their concern, Washington and other governments have ordered or
strongly recommended the evacuation of their nationals from India and
Pakistan.</LD>
<TE>   With all this noise, sometimes bordering on hysteria, one might
conclude that we are on the verge of a catastrophic nuclear war. But
we are not. The well-documented history of the nuclear era--and
virtually all other evidence--suggests that such a war will not
erupt. The provocative words on both sides are part of an elaborate
ritual.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as always, leaders confronting a crisis communicate with one
another not only through quiet diplomatic channels but also by a
public ritualized code. This coded confrontation is often a
substitute for lethal conflict, a kind of foreplay that can end in a
fragile peace if not in a mutual embrace.</TE>
<TE>   Such brinkmanship has had an honored place in the nuclear era.
Over the weekend, brinkmanship began to bear fruit in the softened
rhetoric on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf said that nuclear war was unthinkable. Neither "side is
that irresponsible," and no "sane individual" should even think of
initiating such a war, "whatever the pressures."</TE>
<TE>   He called for a no-war pact with India and the elimination of
nukes from South Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian prime minister said India will not use nuclear weapons
first, but he saw no immediate need for a face-to-face meeting with
Pakistan's president.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Washington is dispatching Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld and other officials to the region to caution restraint.
Though not publicly announced, they will also recommend ways for each
side to tighten its control and safeguard systems to minimize an
accidental launch.</TE>
<TE>   More important than the immediate posturing by India and Pakistan
is the fact that both sides are increasingly aware of the lessons
learned by Washington and Moscow since the dawn of the nuclear era.
Many of those who studied in the U.S. have adopted the esoteric
vocabulary of the nuclear balance. Among the understandings they
learned are these:</TE>
<TE>   * The atom-bombing of Japan in 1945 was a one-time measure, tragic
but justified because it ended a brutal war and saved up to a million
lives, mostly Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   * Shortly after the Soviet Union acquired the atom bomb, both
Washington and Moscow realized that the basic purpose of their
respective stockpiles was to prevent their use. As it turned out, the
delicate nuclear balance of terror also prevented a conventional war.</TE>
<TE>   * The 1962 Cuban missile crisis demonstrated the stabilizing
impact of nuclear deterrence and reinforced the tendency of the
superpowers to rely on less-lethal means for managing conflict.
Further, President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev
negotiated by deeds without the necessity for face-to-face talks.</TE>
<TE>   * After the Soviet Union fell, the threat of nuclear war receded
even further. Both sides increasingly recognized the merit of minimum
deterrence, the view that each side needed only enough nuclear
weapons to make a first strike against it too costly to the other.
What rational Kremlin leader would initiate a nuclear attack if he
assumed millions of his people would perish in retaliation?</TE>
<TE>   To what extent have the leaders of India and Pakistan internalized
these vital lessons? And do they have the requisite
attributes--common sense, prudence and courage--to resist the
passions of the moment? I believe they do.</TE>

<HD>We've Had Enough Witch Hunts</HD>
<DH>War on terrorism does not justify racial profiling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing succeeds like failure. Suddenly, everyone wants to grant the
FBI and other intelligence agencies even more power despite the fact
that they failed so spectacularly to utilize the expansive powers
they had to head off terrorism before Sept. 11. In a sign of mass
impotent rage, liberal columnists and politicians are joining
right-wing talk show blatherers in insisting the FBI not be
"hamstrung" by the restraints of civil liberty.</LD>
<LD>   First to go? Freedom from discrimination based on ethnicity, race
or nationality. Racial profiling, popular since the Dark Ages, is
again in vogue. Consider Sen. Dianne Feinstein's (D-Calif.) comments
Sunday that to prevent terrorism "one isn't going to look for blond
Norwegians" and that "the racial profiling debate has [had] ... a
chilling impact" on the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   The truth is that the bureau was hamstrung not by constitutional
limits on its powers but rather by incompetence and bureaucratic
arrogance at the organization's top, which ignored ample warnings
from below that something terrifying was afoot.</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, the FBI's parent bureaucracy, the Justice Department,
was itself hobbled by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who remained
steadfastly focused on the so-called war on drugs despite urgent
warnings from the previous administration that terrorism was the main
law enforcement problem.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the Bush administration was equally distracted before
Sept. 11, focusing on an illusory promise of missile defense rather
than on the hard reality of terrorism. Former White House officials
have told me that despite the passionate warnings of Richard Clarke,
a top anti-terrorism official under both Bill Clinton and George W.
Bush, the president's Cabinet went the first eight months of his
administration without discussing terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   The killing of thousands of people in New York, Washington and
Pennsylvania on Sept. 11 got their attention, though. Ashcroft
charged the Hill to demand--and receive--sweeping new law enforcement
powers under the USA Patriot Act, hastily passed by a stunned
Congress. He didn't, however, admit under congressional questioning
that his FBI had ample warnings from field agents that a great many
suspicious men were training in U.S. flight schools or that FBI
headquarters had failed to act on the reports.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Ashcroft has approved changes in the FBI's internal
regulations to permit increased spying on Americans, deceitfully
shifting the onus for the failure to protect society from the
incompetence of the Justice Department and the CIA to the alleged
deviousness of John Q. Public. These new powers intrude on the lives
of law-abiding citizens and add nothing that would have helped
prevent the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, Feinstein's call for the FBI to engage in
racial profiling of Arab Americans: Police departments across the
country have found such tactics alienate otherwise loyal minority
communities whose cooperation is indispensable to investigations, and
it also wastes limited resources. Consider the FBI budget and
manpower used to hound Taiwanese-born Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee
for five years without finding evidence of spying.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, for more than a decade, FBI headquarters harbored the
biggest spy of all, top agent and Soviet mole Robert Hanssen. Perhaps
the FBI should racially profile straight white males like Hanssen? Of
course that will never happen, anymore than it did during WWII when
the feds were unwilling to round up Hitler's extensive fifth column
in the German American community, even as apolitical
Japanese-American gardeners were sent to concentration camps.</TE>
<TE>   If we were to be honest in making the case for profiling, we would
go after Saudi Arabians and their business partners and other
associates in this country. The Sept. 11 attacks were--from Osama bin
Laden to 15 of the 19 hijackers to the money that supported them--an
operation with top-to-bottom links to Saudi Arabia, a kingdom our
military has protected for half a century and which enjoys close ties
with Bush's family. Instead of harassing loyal Arab Americans, the
FBI would be better advised to squeeze executives from U.S.
corporations, such as the Carlyle Group and Bechtel, that have
extensive ties to the Saudis.</TE>
<TE>   What we don't need is a witch hunt against the American people,
ferreting through their private lives or detaining them because of
their ethnicity. If there is a group that should be looked at
closely, and with suspicion, it is the top officials of this
administration, whose indifference and incompetence before Sept. 11
may have permitted an incredible tragedy.</TE>

<HD>Connerly Initiative Promotes Racial Balkanization</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YVONNE SCRUGGS-LEFTWICH</AU>
<BD>Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich is executive director of the
national Black Leadership Forum Inc.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ward Connerly, the University of California regent who spearheaded
the successful 1996 initiative to abolish affirmative action in
California schools and government, is again pretending race doesn't
matter. He now is godfather to the Racial Privacy Initiative, which,
if passed by California's voters, would forbid state agencies to note
the race of anyone seeking access to public benefits. This, the
initiative's supporters contend, would make prejudice and racism
disappear.</LD>
<LD>   The effort is at least naive and certainly wrong. Here's why:</LD>
<LD>   * Data about race provide concrete evidence for litigation against
discrimination and inequality. Even before the 1954 Supreme Court
case that nullified separate-but-equal segregation in public
education, hard data have been the foundation of constitutional
challenges to civil rights violations. After the Supreme Court's 1996
decision against affirmative action in Hopwood vs. State of Texas,
for example, race data confirmed a precipitous drop in the number of
blacks entering the University of Texas Law School, from 18 the year
before Hopwood to one student the following year. In 2002 studies of
housing discrimination, race data confirmed that African Americans
paid more for their homes and received less favorable mortgage rates.</LD>
<TE>   * The initiative would convert into law the negative messages that
black is undesirable and that asserting pride in African racial
identity is trouble-making. Bigots would be given a guilt-free pass
because data to substantiate their discriminatory behavior wouldn't
be available.</TE>
<TE>   * Race explains the richness of American culture and should be
celebrated, not hidden. Soul food, jazz, egg rolls, fried rice,
tortillas, the Latin beat--all were created in a "colorblind"
America, right? That notion is as silly as it sounds.</TE>
<TE>   * Reports of an intermarried, race-neutral society are premature
and greatly exaggerated, at least for African Americans. Though the
2000 census reports an increased rate of racial intermarriage,
careful review of these rates reveals that most of the intermarriage
is among Asians and whites and Latinos and whites. Only 4% to 6% of
blacks marry nonblacks. These data contradict Connerly's assertion
that "in 10 to 15 years, intermarriage will make this entire debate a
moot one." Also, data from respected national surveys document that
today there are significantly more segregated communities in which
whites rarely encounter blacks than there were 25 years ago. In 22
states, the African American population is less than 5%; in
California, it is 6.7%. If there are few blacks, it's unlikely there
will be many white-black relationships that blossom into marriage.</TE>
<TE>   As a 2001 poll sponsored by the Washington Post, the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University documented, gross
misperceptions cloud white views of blacks on every important
measure, including societal gains, pay levels, unfair treatment and
access to high-level jobs. These misperceptions--in defiance of
evidence and common sense--mask racial balkanization. Without racial
data, things can only get worse.</TE>

<HD>To Feed World's People, Modern Practices Must Supplant
Organic Fads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM WELLS</AU>
<BD>Jim Wells, the senior vice president of an
environmental consulting company, was director of the California
Department of Pesticide Regulation from 1991 to 1999.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Organic farmers have every right to grow crops using any practice
they deem suitable. Consumers who buy organic produce deserve that
option, and a growing number obviously perceive a benefit.</LD>
<LD>   Yet when deference to a niche segment begins to adversely affect
our ability to produce food most efficiently, it's time to dispel
some myths--because despite its proponents' claims, organic
agriculture is not capable of supplying our country's food needs
while protecting the environment.</LD>
<LD>   One myth is that organic food is more nutritious and better
tasting. Researchers at New Zealand's University of Otago just
completed a review of about 100 studies examining those claims and
found no convincing evidence to support them. In the March 2001 issue
of Nature magazine, University of Edinburgh professor Anthony
Trewavas stated that "hundreds of rigorous tests have failed to
reveal better-tasting properties or improved nutritional value but
have consistently shown that organic produce has lower nitrate and
protein content."</LD>
<TE>   This might seem counter to the experience of shoppers who have
tasted fruits or vegetables right off the truck of a local organic
farmer. But that produce tastes so good because it is picked fresh
and ripe. A conventional farmer, using pesticides and fertilizers,
can similarly impress a farmers market shopper.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, agronomic research has shown that soil type, plant
varieties, irrigation and climate have more to do with nutrition and
eating quality than any other factors. And the higher-profitability
factor that has led some farmers to switch to organic is rapidly
vanishing as more and more organic crops hit the market.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the myths of better nutrition and eating quality pale in
comparison to assertions that organic production techniques are a
viable means of protecting the environment and supplying the nation's
food supply. Researchers at the Hudson Institute recently analyzed
pesticide use in the U.S. and ran some "what-if" calculations on
switching to totally organic pest control techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Applications of sulfur, an element used for disease control by
both organic and conventional fruit and vegetable farmers, would
increase from the current U.S. annual use of 78million pounds to
840million pounds. Use of copper compounds, also important to organic
producers, would increase from 13.7million pounds to 116million
pounds. Should farmers be forced to make a wholesale switch to copper
and sulfur, we'd face the real prospect of long-term soil and
environmental contamination from these broadly toxic elemental
pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   Food producers face some daunting statistics regarding a growing
world population: 9billion people expected by 2050, more affluent in
general than we are now, will demand nearly three times as much food
as is consumed today. Farmers today are doing well by using only 37%
of the Earth's land area for farming and ranching, according to the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Society will need to depend
on modern farming practices to produce the additional food needed
without plowing billions of acres of wildlife habitat. Only
high-yield production agriculture can accomplish that.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to a healthy, plentiful food supply, modern farming
technology, not organic trendiness, offers the more realistic
solution to feeding a growing world population.</TE>

<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's granting of new investigative powers to
the FBI has civil libertarians hitting the panic button about a
return to the J. Edgar Hoover era. Though concern about potential
abuses of the privacy and free-speech rights that help define this
country is justified, hysteria is not.</LD>
<LD>   The limited and necessary regulatory changes are not at all likely
to unleash an army of snoops prying into the average American's life.
They will, however, permit FBI agents to take common-sense steps to
ferret out terrorists, many of whom, presumably, remain eager to blow
the United States and its freedoms into oblivion.</LD>
<LD>   Under Hoover, the FBI violated civil rights left and right (mainly
left), infiltrating legitimate groups, disrupting the lives of
citizens whose political views were in disfavor and spying on and
harassing activists such as Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</LD>
<TE>   But Hoover, who ran the FBI from 1924 to 1972, was a virtual
dictator who cowed presidents and lawmakers. His legacy includes
well-warranted constraints on domestic spying.</TE>
<TE>   Now those controls are being loosened. Under the new rules, agents
can visit houses of worship, rallies and other places or events that
used to be restricted--including cyberspace. For instance, under the
old regulations, agents could not surf the Internet for bomb-making
activity. Nor, unless they were engaged in a specifically related
criminal investigation, were agents permitted to attend public
rallies where a terrorist might be recruiting people to clad
themselves in the bombs he learned to build on the Net. Technology
has made terrorists not only more dangerous but more slippery, and
the FBI has to be able to move in that sophisticated shadow world.</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis agent Coleen Rowley's memo about the difficulty of
obtaining a search warrant in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, the
alleged 20th hijacker, makes painfully clear that the problems at the
bureau are systemic. These problems stem, in part, from the fact that
the FBI reacted like a spoiled brat to the restrictions placed upon
it after the Hoover era: You don't want us spying on respected civil
rights leaders? Fine! But don't blame us for what happens.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions became an excuse for incompetence and the culture of
passivity that eventually quashed real inquiry into the terrorists
training to become suicide pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's guidelines won't by themselves overhaul the bureau.
What's needed are bosses--and we mean Robert S. Mueller III--who
encourage and reward initiative rather than try to cover up
weaknesses. Needed, too, is a renewed commitment by Congress to
monitor the agency and promptly rein it in if the new powers lead to
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, even a magnificently managed agency with a crackerjack
corps of investigators won't be able to stop the next 9/11 if those
agents must tiptoe away from the people most likely to be cooking up
plots.</TE>

<LD>During the 2000 presidential campaign, it seemed Al Gore couldn't
stop discussing global warming and George W. Bush couldn't bear to
talk about it. Bush has now begun to treat the issue seriously,
though he is still far from proposing comprehensive solutions.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the administration issued a quiet policy shift. The
Environmental Protection Agency posted a report on its Web site
acknowledging that man-made greenhouse gas emissions will increase
global temperatures up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit this century and wreak
environmental havoc.</LD>
<LD>   The heat, the report said, will melt Sierra snowpacks, drown coral
reefs and barrier islands, spread diseases transmitted by water and
rodents and cause drought nearly everywhere. These conclusions are
old news to most of the scientific world but still controversial in
political circles.</LD>
<TE>   The candor of the Bush report is welcome, especially given that
fossil fuel companies lobbied the administration to omit projections
of environmental damage and play up possible beneficial side effects
of warming, like a growth in the productivity of some crops.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists promptly lobbed complaints about the report. The
first--that Bush focused on adapting to, rather than preventing,
global warming--is unfair. Even the global warming bills that
environmentalists favor would only slow warming, and government has
to grapple with ways to save crops and coastal towns and prevent
other havoc.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the report should have included tougher controls on
greenhouse gases. The text does not go beyond a general policy called
Clear Skies that the administration issued in February. That proposal
is based on an emissions-trading program that has successfully curbed
acid rain since the first President Bush signed it into law in 1990.
But it lacks the specific emissions reductions required in the Clean
Air Act that Bush's father also signed.</TE>
<TE>   Bush officials insist that specific emissions-reduction
requirements would only discourage innovative, energy-efficient
trading in a free market in which polluters "buy" credits from
cleaner companies. The White House even wants to remove some current
regulations, for instance easing the requirement that electric
companies install up-to-date pollution controls when they upgrade or
expand existing coal-fired plants. There is more emphasis on
self-policing. It all sounds unsettlingly like the "trust but don't
verify" energy deregulation that Enron officials pushed California
legislators to enact.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has taken a significant step. He should keep going, to
specific, enforceable limits on greenhouse gases.</TE>

<LD>Despite ongoing skirmishes, international pressure on Pakistan and
India appears to have reduced the threat of war. For now. To ensure
the two nuclear-armed foes do not cross the line into full-fledged
combat, the United States, Russia, Britain, Japan and other nations
should keep up the lectures and warnings that they might withdraw
aid.</LD>
<LD>   Then President Bush must go one step further and let Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf know unequivocally that, much as we
appreciate his support--Musharraf put his presidency at risk from
domestic opposition when he backed the United States in the fight
against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan--the U.S. will not
tolerate his army's aid to Islamic militants carrying out attacks in
India, especially Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   Bush used tougher-than-usual language on Pakistan last week,
saying Musharraf "must stop the incursions" as he promised. U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld are due to visit India and Pakistan this week and
next. They should emphasize to Musharraf that the halt to border
crossings must be permanent, not temporary. He also has to close the
camps that train the guerrillas.</LD>
<TE>   As these diplomats lecture Pakistan, they should also tell India
that it can reduce tensions by encouraging all parties to take part
in free and fair state elections this fall in Kashmir, the only
predominantly Muslim state in India. That includes allowing factions
supporting independence to be on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Independence is probably just a pipe dream. But giving Kashmir's
residents a greater say in their affairs would rebut Pakistan's claim
of Indian oppression of the state's Muslims. And India would benefit
from discussing greater autonomy for the state that has been the
cause of two of its three wars with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, killings by Pakistan-trained terrorists have caused
India to mass troops on its western border. In response, Musharraf
has moved troops from the border with Afghanistan, where they can
intercept Al Qaeda fighters, to the border with India. This undercuts
the U.S. war on terror at its front lines. Worse, with a million
troops squared off between India and Pakistan, it's only a matter of
time before tensions again reach the trigger point.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and the Soviet Union conducted a nuclear
face-off for decades. They, however, were thousands of miles apart.
India and Pakistan are neighbors and have not worked out detailed
methods of reassuring each other that missile tests are peaceful and
warheads loaded onto bombs are conventional.</TE>
<TE>   Despite assurances to the contrary, neither side seems to
understand the devastation nuclear war would cause.</TE>

<HD>Church Puts New 'Spin' on Child Abuse</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Good grief! The Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles is hiring a PR
firm to deal with "the very negative aspects" of this child sexual
molestation issue that the press has focused on (May 30). Is there
anything positive about molesting children and covering it up?
Apparently the church is having difficulty presenting "the clear
pastoral message of the cardinal."</LD>
<LD>   How about the message that something awful was done repeatedly by
many people and then it went unreported and unpunished by many
others? This PR firm doesn't come cheap either. And which part of
charitable church funds will be earmarked for this? Shouldn't the
church, of all organizations, know what's right and wrong and rectify
the situation by speaking the truth and confessing wrongdoings?</LD>
<LD>   That would be so much cheaper and more forthright than enlisting a
spin doctor.</LD>

<TE>   During the mid-1970s, I served as a psychology consultant to the
L.A. Archdiocese Office of Ministry to the Handicapped. The pay was
minuscule, but the energy, knowledge and devotion shown by the sister
who headed the office at the time was, and still is, inspiring to
this 63-year-old who is a not-very-observant Jew, disabled himself
and an enormously fortunate man.</TE>
<TE>   The car used by Sister Phyllis was approaching 100,000 miles and
was constantly in the garage. She was denied use of a more fit car
but never complained--nor would she accept driving to and from
Camarillo in my far newer car. "We pay you shamefully, anyway," she
said. We did what we could and the work was great. Eventually Sister
Phyllis was transferred to the Midwest, and we have lost contact. Now
the archdiocese has hired Enron's PR firm. You need not be religious
or Catholic to feel like throwing up.</TE>

<HD>Failing to Increase Voter Turnout</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have been involved in California politics for 30 years both as a
volunteer and as a political consultant. "Political Endurance
Contest," your May 28 editorial advocating moving the California
primary election to the first Tuesday in August, is misguided. Do you
really think that an election held in the midst of summer vacation
season is going to generate higher voter turnout than the first
Tuesday in March? The March 2002 primary election had virtually the
same low voter turnout as the June 1994 primary election. Take a look
at the turnout numbers for states that have late primaries in early
September, such as Florida or Nevada. These states have even lower
turnout for their primaries than California did in March.</LD>
<LD>   Another result of moving the primary to the first Tuesday in
August is that it will cause havoc for our county registrars of
voters. In major counties such as Orange, Santa Clara and San Diego
(though not Los Angeles), virtually every elective office is up for
election in November of even years. Filing for office for the
November election closes around mid-August. Just imagine a recount
going on at the same time as the registrar's office is handling the
filing of documents for candidates.</LD>
<TE>   I don't think moving our primary election will result in higher
turnout, but if the Legislature believes moving the date to increase
turnout is important, then the logical date is our previous primary
date: the first Tuesday in June. We need to keep the election process
as simple as possible.</TE>

<HD>New FBI Guidelines on Surveillance</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "FBI Given Broad Authority to Monitor Public Activities," May 31:
The revelations of FBI failures before Sept. 11 surely indicate
drastic changes are needed. However, it is difficult to see how Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft's gift of access into our lives will make the FBI
more effective. The FBI's failures weren't due to a lack of
intelligence (i.e., information) but, rather, a lack of focus and
follow-through at the very top of the agency.</LD>
<LD>   The most important piece of information missing is the motivation
for those from midlevel up to put up roadblocks for agents doing
their best to protect us. This goes beyond what some characterize as
a "liberal-minded" fear of racial profiling; the information
available went far beyond nationality or religion to real connections
with known extremists who had already harmed us. Rather than chipping
away at our 4th Amendment rights by allowing further domestic
surveillance, Ashcroft might serve us better by finding out why good
information gathered under existing surveillance rules went nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   Jan Ducker</LD>
<TE>   Sylmar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American law-abiding citizen has no reason to fear the new FBI
guidelines. The only people who should fear the new "Big Brother"
tactics being implemented by our beleaguered federal law enforcement
agencies are terrorists and other major criminals who would normally
be investigated by the FBI anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us worried about losing our civil rights need look no
farther than the 3,000 people and their families whose constitutional
right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness was taken away on
Sept. 11 by a group of cowards who don't care about our rights or
even their own. If law enforcement hadn't been "handcuffed" by our
national desire to be overly sensitive to the rights of every group
of people who hate our guts, then maybe we wouldn't have to deal with
the daily procession of funerals and memorial services that these
terrorists (who lived and trained in our country) have forced upon
us.</TE>

<TE>   I have just one question for M. Salem Garawi, whose June 3 letter
attacked FBI surveillance of mosques. In the entire world, which
culture, religion or interest group has supported, carried out or
celebrated the greatest number of suicide attacks against unarmed
women and children over the last 20 years? While the methods that the
FBI has been forced to employ may be a "major step backward in
American culture," the acts of Muslim extremists around the world
have been like something out of the Dark Ages. Garawi seems to
suggest we should use our own Constitution as rope to tie our hands
and leave our families at the mercy of bloodthirsty killers who
worship death and destruction.</TE>

<LD>I am the mother of Elie Israel, one of the young persons killed on
Sabado Tarde in Isla Vista on the night of Feb. 23, 2001. I want to
commend your coverage of the David Attias trial. It has been
consistently perceptive and unbiased.</LD>
<LD>   I would, however, like to correct one sentence in "Attias Trial
Points Up Dorm Life's Wild Side" (May 28). I did not and would not
say--as the story suggests--that I have "a special enmity" for
Francisco Torres Residence Hall. There is no way I had or have a
"special enmity" for anyone other than David Attias. I have spent the
past several weeks in the courtroom, listening to the testimony of
dozens of intelligent and clear-headed student witnesses, many of
whom resided in Francisco Torres. I remain grateful for the ongoing
support and sympathy shown to me, and to the families of the other
victims, by the Santa Barbara community.</LD>

<LD>"Setting the Record Straight--After 60 Years" (June 2), on Yoshie
Hagiya, 77, who was finally honored as valedictorian at Oxnard High
School after a wait of 60 years, reminds me of Hitoshi Yonemura, the
head cheerleader at UCLA (and a member of the student council) who
was taken from the campus before he could graduate, joined the Army
and was killed in action in Italy.</LD>
<LD>   I have not seen a memorial to Yonemura at UCLA. It would be nice
if a cheerleading award could be established in his name.</LD>

<LD>Pat Tillman's decision to forgo an NFL career to join the Army makes
me feel both good and bad ("NFL Player Will Take the Field for Army,"
May 30). It makes me feel bad that I was too old to join in
September. It makes me feel great about at least one athlete in pro
sports.</LD>
<LD>   While the pros are calling news conferences to deny steroid use,
going to court for drunk driving cases, denying rumors about their
sexuality and being accused of manslaughter, murder and spousal
abuse, Tillman has decided to take a huge pay cut to join another
team without the fanfare or chest-pounding associated with pro
sports.</LD>
<LD>   I doubt that the U.S. Army will print a card with his vital stats
and, God forbid, his hits, kills and enemies wounded during the war
on terrorism. It's not playing games anymore. It's real life.</LD>
<TE>   I will follow his military career closely; he has gained my
respect, admiration and best wishes. Thank you, Mr. Tillman, I know
now that there is at least one man in professional sports.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you for putting Tillman's story on the front page where it
belonged. What a remarkable human being, one whom our young people
should hope to emulate. Now the NFL can say one of its players is
truly a hero and not be guilty of hyperbole.</TE>

<LD>I am saddened but not surprised over health-care giant Tenet's
decision to close Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital (May 30). I
volunteered there for three years and was heartened by the high
quality of care provided and by the compassion demonstrated by the
dedicated staff--particularly the intensive care nurses--in the face
of dwindling reimbursement and corporate takeover rumors.</LD>
<LD>   At a dinner party about a year ago, I met one of Tenet's
reorganization executives who, at that time, was working on the
purchase of Marina and Memorial hospitals. He addressed my concerns
regarding the importance of maintaining Marina Hospital for our
community with a patronizing: "We would never hurt the community!" I
suppose health-care executives are following the lead of
politicians--sharks in nice suits. God forbid anyone gets bitten
without an emergency room nearby.</LD>

<LD>William Bundy (letter, May 30) informs us that President Clinton left
foreign affairs in worse shape than he found it. Not true; the
so-called experienced members of the elder Bush administration were
responsible for handing off all of Clinton's problems to him. Who was
arming Saddam Hussein up until the Gulf War? Dick Cheney. Who stopped
the U.S. from getting Hussein out of power?</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the solving of the Bosnia problem is not to the liking of
the "far wrong," but it certainly is better than what the elder Bush
left Clinton. When Clinton was making friends with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, the far wrong was all over him. Now it gives
accolades to President Bush for doing the same? What the far wrong
has going is a better spin machine.</LD>

<LD>What a joy it was to read Susan Giesberg's account of her Aunt
Thelma's lifetime love of libraries, "Our Bookshelves, Our Selves,"
in the May 26 Opinion section. It really warmed my heart. This story
is not only a wonderful tribute to the Fairfax branch of the Los
Angeles Public Library and staff but also to Giesberg's family. From
her "personal perspective" I felt as though I had known Tanta Tibe
and her family for years. Thanks for the memories.</LD>

<HD>DUI Suspect's Record Draws Parents' Outrage</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Two men are in comas following an accident Sunday
in Mission Viejo. The driver's license was reinstated only days ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The families of two young men critically injured by an allegedly
drunk driver expressed outrage Monday that the accident happened just
two days after the driver's license had been reinstated after a
suspension for driving under the influence.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes me very angry," said John Conder, father of Jonathan
Conder, 21, who was in a coma Monday afternoon at Mission Hospital
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. "My beliefs tell me that
there is some forgiveness somewhere. I just don't know where it is
right now."</LD>
<LD>   Also injured were Angela Bailey, 18, who was expected to be
released after being treated for broken bones, and Joshua Rogal, 18,
who was reported in critical but stable condition.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just hoping for the best," said Sharry Graham, Rogal's
mother. "He's conscious for only moments at a time. I've spoken to
him, but I'm not sure that he knows who I am."</TE>
<TE>   Rogal, who is to graduate from high school in two weeks, was
driving his white 2001 Pontiac Sunbird through a Mission Viejo
intersection about 12:45 a.m. Sunday when he was broadsided by a
truck that authorities said had run a red light.</TE>
<TE>   Police said its driver--Mark Staffon, 20, of Mission Viejo--had
open alcohol containers in his Chevrolet pickup and tested well above
the legal limit for alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "He was arrested at the hospital but released for medical
attention," said Sgt. Steve Doan, a spokesman for the Orange County
Sheriff's Department. "We still have witnesses to contact, but
eventually we hope to take it to the district attorney's office to
have him charged with DUI."</TE>
<TE>   Staffon, who was treated for minor injuries, would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to police and Department of Motor Vehicles records,
Staffon's driver's license was suspended for a year after he was
stopped in October 2000 while driving with a blood-alcohol level of
.26--more than three times the legal limit.</TE>
<TE>   Records also show he was previously cited for driving without a
fastened seat belt and failure to show proof of insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Misdemeanor charges of possessing alcohol while under 21 were
dismissed in February after he completed an alcohol awareness
program.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Staffon's license was reinstated after he paid a
$100 fee Friday--two days before the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I need to feel real angry about that," Graham said Monday,
"but right now I'm just focused on Joshua."</TE>

in 1972, when Father Bertrand W. Horvath molested him. The suit,
filed last week in Orange County Superior Court, alleges that church
officials moved Horvath, a Franciscan priest, from "parish to parish,
from diocese to diocese, from state to state, so as to make detection
harder and ... to communicate the false impression that corrective
action had been taken."</LD>
<LD>   Horvath, who has not lived in Southern California for at least 22
years, could not be reached for comment late Monday.</LD>

<HD>Teen Who Helped Kill Transient Sent to CYA</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge decides against treatment for the Ventura
boy, ordering him instead to a juvenile detention facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old Ventura boy who participated in the beach-side slaying
of a homeless man last summer will be sent to the California Youth
Authority, not a treatment center for troubled teens, a judge ruled
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge John E. Dobroth told lawyers
he was not convinced the three-year program sought by the defense
would rehabilitate Rocky Mattley as he struggles with anger and
aggression brought on by an unstable family life.</LD>
<LD>   "Rocky didn't put himself here, his parents and his family did,"
Dobroth said. "But Rocky has to live with that."</LD>
<TE>   Dobroth said community safety was also a factor in his decision
because the out-of-state program could only house the boy until his
18th birthday. At the youth authority, Mattley can legally be held
until he turns 25.</TE>
<TE>   As Mattley's mother and father wept in the courtroom, Dobroth
addressed the boy directly, telling him bluntly, "Somehow you've got
to suck it up and make something of your life, son."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling came after a lengthy hearing in Juvenile Court
that included testimony from the boy's psychologist, who recommended
continued therapy, and statements from the victim's family members,
who asked for the harshest punishment possible.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, Mattley was convicted in Juvenile Court of
second-degree murder for participating in the June 30, 2001, slaying
of James Clark, 58, a transient.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Mattley was one of four teens who
stumbled over Clark while headed to a beach party near Surfers Point
in Ventura. They allegedly stole Clark's backpack, then kicked and
beat him as he lay in a sleeping bag.</TE>
<TE>   Clark died after suffering multiple injuries that included a
crushed kidney, a broken rib and a possible skull fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Police later arrested Mattley, Timothy Becker, 18, and Christopher
Dunham, 19, all of Ventura, and Robert Coffman, 19, of Oak View. All
four were charged with murder, but prosecutors decided to keep
Mattley's case in Juvenile Court because he was 14 at the time of the
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   During a four-day trial in March, a Ventura police detective
testified that Mattley admitted kicking "a bum" in the legs and
throwing a rock at him. The judge sustained a juvenile petition
charging him with murder, finding that Mattley participated in the
deadly assault.</TE>
<TE>   At Monday's sentencing hearing, defense lawyers tried to minimize
Mattley's role in the slaying, arguing that he was a tag-along to the
older teens and not the instigator of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Howard Asher said the best way to
rehabilitate his client would be to send him to a treatment center
for troubled boys in western Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   The program does not accept repeat offenders and would give
Mattley a nurturing setting in which he could get the education,
counseling and training he needs to turn his life around, Asher said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an absolutely critical juncture in his life," Asher
argued. "What I have sitting next to me is not a violent individual,
not an individual who cannot be salvaged. I believe Rocky Mattley
deserves an opportunity to make [the program] work."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors argued that the program was insufficient, in part
because Mattley would be released at age 18 and would likely return
to his troubled home life.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Mattley's father went to prison
several years ago for assaulting the boy's mother. Prosecutor Maeve
Fox said the father instilled white supremacist beliefs in his son,
which she argued contributed to the boy's disregard for human life.</TE>
<TE>   Fox urged Dobroth to send Mattley to the youth authority, arguing
that the state could keep Mattley longer while also giving him
counseling and an education.</TE>
<TE>   Trials for the other teens are expected to go forward later this
year in Superior Court. They face mandatory life sentences if
convicted.</TE>

<HD>Disney to Let Public In on Safety Plans</HD>
<DH>Theme parks: In a major policy shift, the company will name
a chief safety officer and release training and procedures manual.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Walt Disney Co., under scrutiny for two high-profile accidents in
a two-year span, will unveil a comprehensive safety plan today that
includes naming a chief safety officer and issuing a 30-page Report
on Safety.</LD>
<LD>   Officials are expected to reveal once closely guarded details of
their theme parks' safety operations in Anaheim and Orlando, Fla.,
including operator guidelines, accident reporting procedures and how
rides are designed with safety in mind.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear whether Disney will be making any major safety
changes or whether it will be opening up its safety statistics for
public scrutiny.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the changes appear to signal a shift in Disney's corporate
culture. In an effort to preserve what company officials often call
the "Disney magic," they have treated discussions of accidents as
taboo.</TE>
<TE>   When a park visitor died after being struck at the dock of the
ship Columbia in December 1998, park officials cleaned up the scene
and interviewed witnesses before authorities arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "It's monumental on several levels," Tim O'Brien, senior editor of
Amusement Business, a weekly trade publication, said of Disney's
change of heart on discussions about safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an openness from the giant that could send ripples across
the whole industry, as far as safety."</TE>
<TE>   Disney officials declined to comment Monday and would not reveal
details of their plan.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, who saw an advance copy of the report and published an
article in this week's Amusement Business, said it names Greg Hale as
the company's first chief safety officer. Hale previously served as
vice president of design, engineering and regulatory compliance at
Walt Disney World.</TE>
<TE>   The report outlines company policies and procedures related to
safety, training, security and emergency response.</TE>
<TE>   It also will be available on the Internet for park guests and
industry officials who may want to model their guidelines after
Disney's.</TE>
<TE>   The report includes a chapter titled "Safety by Design," which
discusses engineering, safety technology, operating guides and
training.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien credited the company for taking the lead in safety
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have long contended that Disney needed to be more
forthcoming about its safety policies and more savvy in its public
response to accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The company came under fire after the Christmas Eve accident at
Disneyland in Anaheim in 1998, when a 33-year-old man from Washington
was killed after a cleat tore free from the Columbia, flew into a
crowd and struck his head.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland employees cleaned up the scene and cleared away
evidence before police arrived 41/2 hours after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   The park was fined $12,500 for misuse of equipment and failing to
train employees properly.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, Disneyland also was criticized for its public
statements following an accident on Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin that
severely injured Brandon Zucker, who was 4 years old at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials stopped short of blaming Brandon, but implied rider
error by issuing statements that guests are safe when they remain
seated and keep their arms and legs inside the ride.</TE>
<TE>   A state investigation found no evidence that Brandon might have
been misbehaving, and Disney was ordered to make design changes to
the ride's "taxi-cab"--style cars.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also determined that Brandon was not loaded properly
into the ride and that the lap bar may not have been completely
lowered.</TE>
<TE>   Len Welsh, special counsel for the state's Division of
Occupational Safety and Health, said he had not seen details of
Disney's safety plan, but applauded the company. "This is the kind of
leadership one would expect out of a Disney," Welsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Fackler, a La Jolla mother whose son was injured more than
four years ago on a Disneyland roller coaster, has been an outspoken
critic of amusement parks. She repeatedly has called for more
regulation, better accident reporting and streamlined, comprehensive
data collection.</TE>
<TE>   Fackler, who did not know the safety campaign's details, said she
has noticed a gradual willingness by Disney officials to discuss
controversial issues.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Glendale man was arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing his
adult son before apparently trying to kill himself, police said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sang Nam Chang, 50, is suspected of attacking his son, Young Wha
Chang, 22, and then turning a knife on himself, said Sgt. Kurt
Palmer, a Glendale police spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer said police were dispatched to the 400 block of Kenwood
Street shortly after 12 a.m. Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Officers found the younger man lying in the living room of the
apartment with knife wounds to the upper body, Palmer said. He was
pronounced dead at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said officers found the victim's father in a bedroom with
knife wounds to the chest, neck and arms. The weapon, described as a
6-inch kitchen knife, was found in the father's possession, Palmer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The father was listed in stable condition at Los Angeles County
USC Medical Center. Authorities said that the son worked on odd jobs
at Los Angeles hotels.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Is Given More Time on Park Parity Plan</HD>
<DH>Land use: Supervisors Chairwoman Coad waits to hear how a
green opportunity at El Toro will translate to the same in North
County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad will
give Irvine more time to come up with a way to pay for its promise to
fund North County parks from redevelopment of the former El Toro
Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Coad said in May that, by today, she wanted details from Irvine of
a plan to set aside $800,000 a year from El Toro for 100 years.
Without that, she said, she was prepared to rescind her April vote
allowing Irvine to begin to annex the 4,700-acre base, where the
county once hoped to have an airport. The Navy, which still owns El
Toro, plans to sell the land to the highest bidder.</LD>
<LD>   After a meeting late Monday, Coad said Irvine officials promised
to have a "skeleton of a structure" in her hands before today's Board
of Supervisors meeting. She didn't say how much money was possible or
how it would be provided. She has previously been unwilling to settle
for less funding.</LD>
<TE>   Coad said she has been encouraged by some constituents to rescind
her vote and keep the base under county control, which means
redevelopment would be restricted by zoning imposed by the
voter-passed Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   If Irvine annexes the property, it does not have to follow the
dictates of Measure W, which rezoned the base from an airport to
parkland and limited types of development.</TE>
<TE>   Park plans for that South County land prompted Coad to press for
parity in the form of parks money for North County.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big credibility gap, not just between myself and
Irvine, but between them and a lot of cities," Coad said of Irvine's
extensive mailings to voters during the campaign for the March
initiative, promising to build a "Great Park" at El Toro with
museums, botanical gardens, sports fields and a large lake.</TE>
<TE>   The city pledges to honor the spirit of Measure W if it annexes
the land.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's April vote to allow annexation removed a critical roadblock
for Irvine, enabling the city to control what is built at El Toro
although it wouldn't own any of the land. A new vote by the Board of
Supervisors could reinstall that roadblock because it must approve
annexations.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent to county officials earlier Monday, Irvine City
Manager Allison Hart said the city's pledge to set aside El Toro
funds for North County parks had been based on its hope that Irvine
would become the owner of the base property and control future leases
and other revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But the Navy has since announced that it does not intend to let
Irvine acquire the property. The Navy reiterated that position in a
letter last week.</TE>
<TE>   Without such control, the city can only offer to share property
taxes when it annexes the land, Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   But under a plan announced in April, Irvine will create a
redevelopment agency for the land, which means the bulk of future
taxes on the property would go to the agency.</TE>
<TE>   A 1993 change in state redevelopment law mandates that the county
would get only 25% of future property taxes--not the 82% that the
city promised to the county in the agreement Coad approved.</TE>

<HD>Ruling on Magnet School Gets F From Parents</HD>
<DH>Education: Placentia- Yorba Linda pupils can't attend Troy
High's Int'l Baccalaureate classes because of plans for a similar
program locally.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy High School's recent win in the national Science Olympiad was a
sweet victory for the students and their parents. But for families
who can't enroll their children in the highly regarded science
magnet, it was a bitter reminder that their home district,
Placentia-Yorba Linda, won't let them go there.</LD>
<LD>   The high school in Fullerton attracts students from four counties
to its International Baccalaureate program, which offers upper-level
classes in science, math and other disciplines. In fact, 72% of Troy
students come from outside the Fullerton Union High School District.
Until this year, several dozen usually came from neighboring
Placentia-Yorba Linda School District.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the Placentia-Yorba Linda district is starting a similar
program at Valencia High and does not want to lose students to the
neighboring district beginning next fall.</LD>
<TE>   "They want his test scores; they don't want a brain drain," said
Shirley Krider, whose son earned top scores on state standardized
tests but won't be allowed to attend Troy.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say students will receive a similar education
at Valencia High's International Baccalaureate program.</TE>
<TE>   "The standards, the content [of the baccalaureate programs] are
the same ... worldwide," said David Verdugo, assistant principal of
executive services for Placentia-Yorba Linda. "You could go to
Geneva, Switzerland, and it won't be different."</TE>
<TE>   While Troy "has a track record" of high-achieving students in math
and science, Verdugo said Valencia is academically noteworthy as an
"outstanding high school that has previously provided a very high
volume of Advancement Placement courses."</TE>
<TE>   Parents, who say their children already had been accepted by Troy,
argue that the Valencia program is not yet in place. They note that
the school has not received approval from the International
Baccalaureate program, based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The Science Olympiad is just one of those things that shows what
Troy is all about," said parent Tony Quinto, whose son, Lawrence, was
accepted by Troy but denied a district transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Troy won the prestigious national science competition for the
fourth time in eight years--and Quinto was hoping Lawrence, now in a
private Catholic school, could try out for the Troy team in the
coming school year.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia could not prepare him for such a team because it "doesn't
have the program in place yet," Quinto said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Troy scored 850 on the state's Academic Performance
Index, a measurement of school performance based largely on
standardized test scores. That was the third-highest score in Orange
County. Valencia ranked 38 with a score of 635.</TE>
<TE>   Verdugo said a transfer is allowed only when a student will attend
a program not offered at his district. George Giokaris, deputy
superintendent for Fullerton Joint Union High School District,
declined Monday to comment on the Placentia-Yorba Linda policy.</TE>
<TE>   Parent Raj Sivalingan argues that similar programs or not, a
college diploma from Harvard is not like one from another college.</TE>
<TE>   "They will not get me to send my kid to Valencia, and none of the
other parents will send their kids there either," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the parents appealed Placentia-Yorba Linda's decision to
the Orange County Board of Education, but, on May 16, were turned
down.</TE>
<TE>   The board has reviewed a mass of transfer appeals only once
before, said board president Elizabeth Parker, when districts would
not allow students to attend the Orange County High School of the
Arts. The board approved the transfers because the school offered a
unique program in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Parker said 18 of the 22 students did not attend public schools
and that the families "really showed us they have no faith in the
public school system anyway."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, one family that has lived in the same Yorba Linda
house for 23 years is planning to move to the Fullerton district</TE>
<TE>   "We want our son to have the same quality of education as our
daughters had," said Joyce Lovinger, whose two older children were
Troy graduates.</TE>

<HD>Fire Above Ojai Rages Unabated</HD>
<DH>Sespe Wilderness: Shifting winds, dry weather and rugged
terrain hinder crews. Blaze 'is like an out-of-control locomotive,'
official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES and JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stoked by hot, dry weather and churning winds, a wildfire 12 miles
north of Ojai more than doubled in size to more than 6,000 acres
Monday as an expanding crew of firefighters struggled to contain it.</LD>
<LD>   "This fire is out of control," said Darren Drake, a spokesman for
the U.S. Forest Service, as he watched 20-foot-high flames on a ridge
in the Sespe Wilderness. "The wind has been dictating the fire. Right
now, this thing is like an out-of-control locomotive."</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,000 firefighters from around the state were attacking
the blaze, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The arid conditions--perfect for a wildfire when combined with
tinder-dry pine trees and chaparral--are expected to continue through
Wednesday, with temperatures climbing into the 90s. But winds should
dwindle to about 15 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Thick brown smoke dropped white soot on much of the Ojai Valley on
Monday. Ashes reached as far as Thousand Oaks, coating sidewalks,
cars and lawns.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, which began Saturday and is one of four wildfires
burning in Southern California, showed no signs of slowing as
officials prepared to bring in additional firefighters specially
trained to battle large wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters on the front lines said the weather, along with steep
and rugged terrain, were hindering their ability to get the blaze
under control.</TE>
<TE>   There are no access roads in the federally protected Sespe
Wilderness, and federal law prohibits the use there of bulldozers,
chain saws and other mechanical equipment, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty inaccessible area," said Walt Mendoza, a
firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service, as he pumped water from
Tule Creek into a firetruck. "We're stuck here on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza said he was among the first firefighters on the scene
Saturday as the blaze burned through the Felt Ranch and destroyed
several abandoned cabins and equipment sheds. Mendoza and other
firefighters narrowly escaped injury after the flames swept through
their position.</TE>
<TE>   "We were there for 30 minutes when things went bad," said Mendoza,
37, of Ventura as he stood among burning embers in a field of charred
brush. "This looks like it's going to be a real bad season."</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire remained under investigation. It began about
3 p.m. at the Pine Mountain Inn and moved east quickly, paralleling
California 33. Fanned by steady winds, it broke into two fronts
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday morning, fire officials said a key objective was to keep
the flames from heading northeast into the heavily wooded terrain
along the Pine Mountain ridge and Reyes Peak.</TE>
<TE>   By the afternoon, they were forced to change tactics after the
winds pushed the flames toward the 7,000-foot peak.</TE>
<TE>   "This tiger is uncontrollable at this point, because it's moving
in all directions," said Joe Duran, deputy logistics chief for Los
Padres National Forest. "We need to be cautious and let it do its
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Although the fire is burning in remote back country and has so far
threatened no homes, Duran said the loss of vegetation on hillsides
could cause mudslides and flooding into the streams and creeks that
flow through several Ventura County cities.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be nothing to hold [water] back," Duran said. "We will
be living with the aftereffects for years."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said 10 helicopters, and six tankers each with up to
3,000 gallons of water, were flying above the fire throughout the
day. At one point, thick smoke at the head of the fire kept aircraft
away.</TE>
<TE>   Only 10% of the fire had been contained by Monday evening, and
firefighters had no estimate for reaching full control, said Joe
Pasinato, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get down to 8% humidity, it does get explosive out
there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Through most of Monday, the fire was headed away from Ojai, but by
late evening the wind had shifted southeast. Officials said homes
were still 10 to 12 miles from the blaze. "I don't see an imminent
threat right now to Ojai," Pasinato said. In the downtown area,
several businesses had posted signs advertising free meals for
firefighters. Several residents living along California 150 hung
homemade signs from their fences wishing the firefighters luck.</TE>
<TE>   At the 4,500-foot level, dozens of firefighters with pickaxes and
shovels in hand trudged along winding California 33, stomping out
patches of hot brush and looking for new hot spots on thickly wooded
hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was moving through a section of rocky peaks and steep
valleys that had been untouched by fire for 70 years. The Matilija
fire in 1932 charred 219,000 acres, Pasinato said. In 1984, the
Wheeler fire burned 118,000 acres and destroyed 26 homes in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze has closed a stretch of the highway and several popular
campgrounds and hiking areas, including Rose Valley, Pine Mountain
and Wheeler Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife in the area--including the endangered arroyo toad and
southern steelhead trout--could also be affected, officials said.
Other species that could be displaced by the wildfire include the
red-legged frog and the southwestern willow flycatcher. Officials
from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have been tapped to advise
fire officials on how to minimize further damage to wildlife habitat.</TE>
<TE>   While the public's safety comes first, biologist Rick Farris said
he has recommended firefighters avoid clearing brush along streams at
the bottom of canyons and keep fire retardant from open water.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fairly natural occurrence--a lot different than, say, a
housing development," Farris said. "In terms of long-term survival,
this is a glitch in the habitat and it'll come back eventually."</TE>
<TE>   Two wildfires continued to burn in the San Bernardino National
Forest on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Lake Arrowhead fire had burned more than 2,600 acres since
starting Friday during a fire training exercise. Two commercial
structures, four storage buildings and a trailer were destroyed, and
three firefighters received minor injuries. The blaze was 80%
contained by Monday afternoon, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Georgia Smith said. More than 600 firefighters were supported by
water-dropping helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   "The weather has been very, very cooperative with us," Smith said.
There was no wind, temperatures hovered in the low 80s and humidity
was below 25%.</TE>
<TE>   South of that blaze in the forest was the Bee fire, which
destroyed 432 acres after starting Sunday afternoon east of Hemet. It
was 50% contained by noon Monday. Fire officials directing four
helicopters and 175 firefighters expected full control before dark,
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sequoia National Forest, near Lake Isabella northeast of
Bakersfield, 450 acres burned in a fire that started Sunday evening.
It was 10% contained Monday with 150 firefighters helped by an air
tanker and a helicopter, Forest Service spokeswoman Margie Clack
said.</TE>

<HD>Canada Rejects Terror Charges</HD>
<DH>Probe: Ottawa wants the U.N. to take a man the U.S. linked
to Al Qaeda off a suspects list. It cites a lack of evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The Canadian government, saying one of its citizens was unfairly
targeted by the American-led anti-terror campaign here, said Monday
that it will ask the Security Council to remove the man's name from
its list of accused Al Qaeda accomplices.</LD>
<LD>   Liban Hussein, a 31-year-old Somalia-born Ottawa businessman, was
among 220 people named publicly by the Security Council last fall as
key members or financial backers of Osama bin Laden's global
terrorism network. In accord with binding U.N. resolutions, Canada
immediately arrested Hussein and seized his financial assets.</LD>
<LD>   The U.N. named Hussein as an Al Qaeda supporter at the request of
the United States, which had said that he and his Boston-based
brother had helped underwrite terrorist operations through an
unregistered international money- transfer business.</LD>
<TE>   But on Monday, the Canadian government said it could find no
evidence to support the allegations. It dropped all charges against
Hussein, released funds that were frozen in his Canadian bank
accounts and announced that it would not honor a U.S. extradition
request. Hussein had been out on bail, awaiting the extradition
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on a full and thorough investigation of the information
collected in relation to the extradition proceedings, the government
of Canada has concluded that there are no reasonable grounds to
believe Mr. Hussein is connected to any terrorist activities," the
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   It said U.S. officials had been informed of the extradition
decision and "indicated they do not object."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Hussein's brother Mohammed was convicted in a Boston
court of operating a business without a state license and illegally
sending money abroad. But prosecutors never filed terrorism-related
charges against either brother.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's action marked only the second time that a U.N. member has
openly questioned the Security Council's listing of accused Al Qaeda
members and benefactors. Earlier this year, Sweden complained about
the inclusion of three Somalian immigrants from Stockholm who, like
the Husseins, ran a money-transfer business with partners in
Mogadishu, the Somalian capital.</TE>
<TE>   Swedish diplomats said the men had protested their innocence and
were unable to obtain any details about their alleged involvement
with Al Qaeda. But in a closed-door meeting, diplomats and U.N.
officials said, the United States and at least two other Security
Council members argued that all three Swedish residents should remain
on the list.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. list--which contains 72 charities and businesses, 152
former Taliban officials and 68 other individuals accused of Al
Qaeda-related activity--was compiled on the basis of information
provided by the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies. Any
member of the Security Council can add names to the list provided
that other members do not object. Some European governments and human
rights groups have complained that evidence may never be disclosed
and that even the process for exonerating the falsely accused is kept
secret.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Court Orders Militant Freed</HD>
<DH>Mideast: As the CIA chief arrives for talks, ruling on
assassination suspect riles Israel. West Bank officials keep him
jailed for his own safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Palestinian judges on Monday ordered the release of militant leader
and suspected assassination mastermind Ahmed Saadat, stirring this
region's rage just as CIA Director George J. Tenet arrived to discuss
the troubled Palestinian security services.</LD>
<LD>   Chief of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, Saadat was suspected of overseeing the October shooting
death of Israel's ultranationalist tourism minister, Rehavam Zeevi.
Months later, in a hastily assembled Palestinian tribunal, four
members of Saadat's group were found guilty of gunning Zeevi down in
a hotel hallway, but their leader was neither charged nor brought to
trial.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, Saadat and five other wanted men were imprisoned in
May as part of a deal ending a monthlong Israeli siege that had
trapped Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat in his West
Bank headquarters. Monday afternoon, a panel of judges ruled
unanimously that no evidence linked Saadat to Zeevi's killing and
that there was no justification for keeping him behind bars.</LD>
<TE>   Within hours of the hearing, furious Israeli leaders were spitting
out veiled threats against the imprisoned radical.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is not brought to justice," said Raanan Gissin, a spokesman
for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, "we will bring justice to
him."</TE>
<TE>   It was almost midnight when Palestinian leaders said they feared
for Saadat's life and would not release him "in these conditions,"
calling Gissin's words an assassination threat and citing an Israeli
closure of the West Bank city of Jericho, where the jail holding the
men is located.</TE>
<TE>   It was a politically crafty maneuver. Arafat faced tremendous
pressure from both sides, and any hard stance would have been held up
as proof that the Palestinian leader hadn't mended his ways.</TE>
<TE>   As Palestinians were quick to point out, Arafat signed legislation
a few weeks ago to guarantee the independence of the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "The court's decision is a step in the right direction," Saadat
told the Reuters news agency in an interview from his prison cell. "I
hope that the Palestinian Authority will respect the court's ruling
at a time when it talks about separation of power and rule of law."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the crisis came in the thick of Israeli
complaints that Arafat isn't doing enough to stop renegade attacks.
Sharon met with Tenet on Monday night and had been expected to tell
him that no change, however drastic, can improve Palestinian security
forces as long as Arafat holds power. The release of a suspected
assassin would have strengthened his argument.</TE>
<TE>   "The [court's] decision once again proves to anybody with eyes in
his head that there's no law, order and certainly no justice in the
Palestinian Authority," Israeli Justice Minister Meir Sheetrit said.
"It's proof to the world that there's no change and there are no
reforms."</TE>
<TE>   The diplomatic push will continue on other fronts. President Bush
is to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at Camp David, Md.,
this weekend. And Sharon is to meet Bush in Washington next Monday,
about a month after he cut short a visit in the wake of a suicide
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak reportedly will push for a timetable for Palestinian
statehood.</TE>
<TE>   The turmoil over Saadat is just one more piece of chaos in this
charged political landscape. Israel is rattled and enraged by an
ongoing spate of suicide bombings and sniper attacks. The bloodshed
has continued despite a prolonged hunt by the army for suspected
militants.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leadership, which was scheduled to meet with Tenet
today, is furious too. For weeks, Israeli soldiers have been laying
siege to West Bank cities, villages and refugee camps. The routine is
familiar by now: Tanks roll into town, soldiers impose a strict
curfew, and everybody cowers behind closed doors. Soldiers ring the
neighborhoods, bang on doors and root through rooms in search of
damning evidence. Loudspeaker announcements order all males between
the ages of 15 and 45 to emerge in the streets to be interrogated.</TE>
<TE>   It goes on for days sometimes. Monday marked the fourth day in a
row that Israeli soldiers had kept Nablus, an ancient and bustling
West Bank city, locked down. Bomb laboratories have been destroyed,
and hundreds of suspects have been carted off to military detention.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, Israeli tanks and troops swept into the West Bank
city of Jenin but not its adjacent refugee camp, Palestinian security
officials and witnesses said. There were no immediate reports of any
clashes with Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions for reform are not there," Palestinian Information
Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo said. "The Israeli army is imposing the
strictest siege around the cities, and the confiscation of land is
continuing."</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the low-level warfare, the battle drags on for
scraps of this old turf. Under a relentless desert sun, Israeli
developers clashed Monday with Palestinians over a scenic run of sand
and olive groves on an East Jerusalem hillside.</TE>
<TE>   The diggers arrived at dawn, heavy machines, strips of chain-link
fence and steel pipes in tow.</TE>
<TE>   "I said: 'What are you doing? This is our land,'" said Palestinian
Hussein Obeidat, a resident who said his family has owned the land
for centuries. But the foreman wasn't interested in complaints. While
Palestinians shouted and scrambled for court intervention, border
police and private guards stood sentry--and digging got underway.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for an Israeli subdivision that will be called Nof
Zahav ("Gold View") and consist of apartments, a luxury hotel and a
cable car. It will also create an Israeli outpost in a predominantly
Palestinian area.</TE>
<TE>   The breaking of this disputed ground tapped into two of the
Palestinians' chief complaints: the ongoing establishment of Jewish
settlements on Palestinian land and the complex battle over who can
lay claim to various portions of Jerusalem. Monday afternoon, Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres chastised developers for plowing ahead
with the controversial project--particularly on a day laced with
diplomatic dilemmas.</TE>
<TE>   But developer and former Jerusalem police chief Arieh Amit was
firm. "We will not be dragged into political disputes," he said. "We
will try to build the most beautiful project possible, and in the end
the area will benefit too."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Alalu Jose shrugged his shoulders. "All of this is
to stop the Arabs from expanding," he said. "They're doing it little
by little, in a pretty way, but that's what it is."</TE>

<HD>War of Words at Asia Summit</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: At gathering in Kazakhstan, Pakistan and India
trade charges over attacks in Kashmir. Putin aims to get the two
nuclear rivals to talk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALMATY, Kazakhstan</DL>
<LD>The leaders of India and Pakistan traded charges in Kazakhstan today
at the opening of a regional security summit, as Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin aimed to persuade the two nuclear powers to pull
back from the brink of war over the disputed region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   By a quirk of circumstance, this city in the heart of Central
Asia, a place hardly anyone has heard of, has become the stage for a
meeting of high drama and global importance.</LD>
<LD>   "We are concerned about conflict in South Asia," Kazakh President
Nursultan A. Nazarbayev intoned in a speech opening the first meeting
of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in
Asia. "We wish and call upon our neighbors to achieve a peaceful
resolution of the problems."</LD>
<TE>   With India and Pakistan on the verge of war, he stressed, times
call for "reserve and responsibility." Putin is spearheading an
international press to persuade the two nuclear powers to pull back
from the brink and start a process of de-escalation and dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, in his plenary speech,
denied any guilt by Pakistan in the recent attacks in India or the
Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir by Islamists seeking to wrest
that part of the disputed Himalayan territory from New Delhi's
control.</TE>
<TE>   "Targeting of innocent people cannot be justified under any
circumstances. We do and we must reject terrorism in all of its forms
and manifestations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "However, there is also a need for introspection," Musharraf said.
The causes of extremism must be addressed, including "eliminating
injustice" in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani general pledged that his nation stands ready to
respond if attacked, but he ended with a plea for peace. "We need to
return to the path of dialogue and negotiations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, speaking a little
later, responded to Musharraf's speech directly. He said that
Pakistan had not lived up to promises it made earlier this year to
end "cross-border terrorism" and charged that "terrorist camps
operate unhindered" along the border.</TE>
<TE>   "Regrettably, the settlement of conflicts with the help of
dialogue has been facing a strong opponent lately. Its name is
terrorism, which is supported by religious extremism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have repeatedly said we are ready to discuss all issues, but
for that, cross-border terrorism has to end," Vajpayee declared. He
said states should not indulge in nuclear blackmail, repeating
earlier pledges that India will not be the first to use nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   On the edges of the meeting, representatives of the two nations
were trying to convince the world they were more level-headed and
peace-loving than the other. But for other participants in the
summit, it was hard to escape a stark fear that any miscalculation
could bring about a catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the fact of the leaders of India and Pakistan being in the
same place at this particular moment is potentially positive," said
one diplomatic observer. "We do see this as a serious opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The coincidence that brought Vajpayee and Musharraf to Kazakhstan
at this time was the first meeting of the new Asian security
conference, called CICA for short. The organization is meant to be
Asia's version of the Helsinki process, which evolved into the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Conceived by Nazarbayev in 1992, for many years it seemed a
quixotic dream on his part to create a forum where all countries of
the continent could exchange views on questions of mutual security on
an equal footing.</TE>
<TE>   Slow and patient diplomacy on Nazarbayev's part--coupled perhaps
with the realization that Kazakhstan's newly tapped oil wealth near
the Caspian Sea may eventually make this nation an economic power to
be reckoned with--have helped make the dream a reality.</TE>
<TE>   Almaty's streets have been decked out in the flags of the 16
nations participating, creating the rather incongruous sight of the
flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran fluttering once removed from
Israel's blue-and-white Star of David banner.</TE>
<TE>   In a flower-bedecked conference room, the heads of state and
government sat around a rectangular bank of tables. Musharraf was
seated next to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Neither Vajpayee nor
Musharraf, seated a few feet away, made any apparent effort to greet
or talk with each other.</TE>
<TE>   Putin volunteered to lend his efforts to ease the crisis between
India and Pakistan at Almaty, and he has scheduled separate meetings
with both Musharraf and Vajpayee. Addressing the plenary meeting a
few hours after arriving in Almaty from Moscow, he said the conflict
between the two had caused great concern.</TE>
<TE>   Putin has been riding a crest of diplomatic successes over the
last two weeks, including his summit in Russia with President Bush
and a meeting with the European Union during which the EU promised to
recognize Russia's status as a free-market economy.</TE>
<TE>   But going into today's meeting, Putin's spokesmen were giving no
hints of what arguments or program he would outline to Vajpayee and
later to Musharraf during their meetings this evening.</TE>
<TE>   Indian officials are angered by attacks from "jihadists," who New
Delhi says are based in Pakistan and are responsible for about 900
deaths in India since March. Tensions reached a peak after militants
raided an Indian army camp on May 14, killing more than 30 people.
That prompted both sides to mass more troops along the Line of
Control that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir, and led to
ominous warnings from India that the time for diplomatic solutions
was running out.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, India and Pakistan exchanged intense artillery and
machine-gun fire along their frontier, killing at least eight
civilians--seven Pakistanis and one Indian. Fighting spread for the
first time this year to the Lipa Valley, in the southeastern part of
Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, sources in Muzaffarabad, the region's
capital, told Associated Press. Indian officials have claimed that
the valley is a staging area for Pakistan-based militants seeking to
infiltrate the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of villagers living on both sides of the Line of Control
have fled, Indian and Pakistani officials said. On Monday, Norway and
Israel joined the list of countries warning their citizens against
traveling to the region.</TE>
<TE>   In Almaty, Russian Foreign Ministry officials said they were
holding out hope that Putin would be able to engineer a three-way
meeting of himself, Vajpayee and Musharraf, but the Indians have said
it is not in the cards.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what other countries' opinions are, India's opinion is
very clear, and that is that we are not meeting Musharraf here,"
Deputy Indian Foreign Minister Omar Abdullah said Monday, with
evident impatience.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he said, "Obviously we are going to listen to what
President Putin has to say."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, Russia has had a close friendship with India, but
its relations with Pakistan have been poor--though improving
recently. Whether Putin's efforts succeed or fail, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage and Secretary of Defense
Donald H. Rumsfeld are to arrive in South Asia later this week to
apply more direct American pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In his talks to reporters Monday, including a handful from India,
Pakistani Information Minister Nisar Memon insisted that Pakistan
would be tireless in its search of a solution to the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The president of Pakistan has come here in search of peace. He
has come here in search for dialogue with India on all outstanding
issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Brajesh Mishra, India's national security advisor, was leery
of the assurances. "Gen. Musharraf has made some promises. And if
these promises are implemented and we can verify them, then we will
take appropriate steps. But the emphasis is on implementation."</TE>
<TE>   As to nuclear weapons, he said: "We want to [have] them as a
deterrent. But if someone uses them against us, obviously there would
be a response. But I want to emphasize, we don't want to indulge in
any loose talk about nuclear weapons. We just want to avoid talking
about them."</TE>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Buckingham Palace rocked Monday night with screaming guitars,
cheering fans and pop stars led by Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton in
a concert celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's 50 years on the throne.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 1 million people thronged the parks and roads around
the palace, including thousands who waved the Union Jack flag in the
plaza below.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd cheered wildly, starting with the opening act of "The
Party at the Palace"--guitarist Brian May of the group Queen, who
stood on the palace roof and sang "God Save the Queen." The audience
was still hollering when the queen came out to address the crowd at
the end of the concert, which closed the third day of the four-day
jubilee.</LD>
<TE>   Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin went straight into "The Cup of
Life" and then sang "Livin' La Vida Loca."</TE>
<TE>   More than three hours later, the concert ended with McCartney
singing a medley of Beatles classics. He sang some of the songs
alone, some with rock stars from his generation, such as Clapton, Rod
Stewart and Joe Cocker, and two at the finale with the many other
performers from the gala.</TE>
<TE>   When the music ended, the queen led the royal family on stage to
thank the performers.</TE>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Pakistan has blocked financial assistance to 115 Islamic schools,
known as madrasas, because of their alleged involvement in militancy,
sectarian violence and terrorism, a senior cleric said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next three years, the government will release $250
million to about 8,000 Islamic schools, but those on the blacklist
"will not get even a single penny," said Mufti Abdul Qavi, a member
of the Pakistan Madrasa Education Board, authorized recently by
President Pervez Musharraf to purge Islamic schools of extremism.</LD>
<LD>   Qavi said most of the schools belong to the Deoband, Ahle Hadith,
Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan and minority Shiite organizations.</LD>
<TE>   "Madrasas of the outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and
other militant organizations--fighting Indian rule in Kashmir--will
also not be eligible for any kind of government financial
assistance," Qavi said.</TE>
<TE>   Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba are among the militant groups
blamed by India for a deadly attack on its Parliament complex in
December.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Boost Philippine Effort</HD>
<DH>Asia: Special Forces troops are to aid in the intensified
hunt for Abu Sayyaf rebels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ISABELA, Philippines</DL>
<LD>ISABELA, Philippines -- The United States and the Philippines agreed
Monday to move U.S. Special Forces troops closer to combat areas in
the country's south in a stepped-up manhunt for Muslim guerrillas
linked to Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   The presidential palace in Manila announced the decision as U.S.
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz flew to the southern
island of Basilan, stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf rebels, and met U.S.
troops training Philippine soldiers in counter-terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Delayed military reports said six guerrillas and a Philippine
soldier were killed in fighting Sunday with another Abu Sayyaf group
operating on Jolo island, near Basilan.</LD>
<TE>   "There was consensus that training will be intensified and pushed
forward," Philippine presidential spokesman Silvestre Afable said
after talks between Wolfowitz and government officials.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. troops will not be allowed to engage the rebels in
combat, as "this is the war of our own armed forces," he said. The
Americans can fire only in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides said they were also considering extending their joint
military exercises, which are aimed at wiping out the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf says it is fighting for a separate Muslim state.</TE>

<HD>Party Rejoins Sharon Government</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas Party formally rejoined Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's government Monday, broadening his ruling majority two
weeks after he fired Shas ministers for voting against an austerity
plan.</LD>
<LD>   Parliament ratified the return of Shas' four ministers to the
Cabinet by a vote of 54 to 24, and they were then sworn in. With the
support of Shas' 17 legislators, the government will control 77 of
the 120 seats in parliament.</LD>
<LD>   In a move hailed by many Israelis opposed to decades of government
funding for religious schools and large Orthodox families, Sharon
fired Shas' ministers May 20 for voting against an emergency
financial plan in a first reading.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli media reported that under a compromise deal that paved the
way for its return, Shas would be allowed to raise objections to the
plan in a parliamentary committee preparing it for the next round of
voting.</TE>
<TE>   Shas, a self-declared champion of Israel's poor, had said it could
not support a law that would cut welfare subsidies and raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon stood his ground, saying he would soldier on at the
head of a narrow government because the austerity plan was vital to
healing an Israeli economy reeling under recession and the costs of
combating a Palestinian uprising for independence.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also ejected a smaller ultra-Orthodox coalition partner,
United Torah Judaism, two weeks ago for voting against the emergency
package. The party has not said whether it would now follow Shas back
into the government.</TE>

<DH>Asia: Delegates planned visit to smooth the way for
dialogue but wound up being denied visas.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>They flew all the way to Asia with the intention of visiting North
Korea. When visas weren't forthcoming, they asked U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
intercede.</LD>
<LD>   But the delegation of 12 U.S. Congress members ended up flying
home to Washington on Monday, frustrated by an unmistakable snub from
the North Korean government.</LD>
<LD>   "Here was a chance to open the door, and they slammed it in our
face," Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), who led the delegation, said at a
breakfast meeting with journalists Monday in Seoul.</LD>
<TE>   The 10-day trip included stops in Russia, Uzbekistan, China and
South Korea, but the delegates' main goal was to visit North Korea in
an effort to smooth the way for an official dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   The delegation's star-crossed adventures highlighted the
difficulty of dealing with North Korea, which has a reputation in
diplomatic circles as one of the world's most eccentric and
unpredictable countries. Although delegation members did not have
visas when they left Washington, Weldon said they had an
"understanding of an entry" into North Korea, around which they built
their itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   When they arrived last week in Beijing--the only city with regular
flights to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital--they found there were
no visas. They met with Jiang on Wednesday and asked him to
intervene, then waited. They tore up their schedule, canceling a stop
in Hong Kong, then waited some more. Then they flew to Seoul, working
more channels and hoping as late as Sunday night that they might
still obtain visas.</TE>
<TE>   "Someday I could write a book about trying to get into North
Korea," said Weldon, who added that he understood that the matter
went as high as North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. "I think you have to
have a magical code to punch the numbers in."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Alcee L. Hastings, a Florida Democrat, added: "The real truth
is that it is Kim Jong Il's loss. This gentleman does not want his
people to interface with others."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the rebuff to the congressional delegation came at a
time when North Korea has indicated publicly that it wants to attract
foreign investment and tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last month, the North Koreans have been staging an
elaborate festival of mass acrobatics in a pitch for visitors. But
attendance has been disappointing, with fewer paying guests than
performers at Pyongyang's 150,000-seat May Day stadium. In most
cases, the North Koreans have refused visas to tourists holding U.S.
or South Korean passports.</TE>
<TE>   "While they [the North Koreans] have opened up in certain ways and
they are making noises consistent with economic reform, there still
seems to be some reluctance to take the bull by the horns," Bradley
Babson, a North Korea specialist with the World Bank, said at a
conference in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The last time an official U.S. representative traveled to
Pyongyang was in October 2000, when then-Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright visited the capital. U.S.-North Korea relations have
deteriorated badly during President Bush's term and especially since
January, when Bush branded North Korea part of an "axis of evil"
along with Iraq and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. special envoy Jack Pritchard was expected to visit Pyongyang
last month, but the trip was delayed, according to sources, in part
because of divisions within the Bush administration about the message
Pritchard should convey to the North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's obstreperous negotiating tactics are famous among
diplomats. It is not uncommon for the country to abruptly change
plans or withdraw invitations, though seldom to such a senior
delegation. In December 2000, an American business delegation
organized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Seoul traveled to
Beijing with an invitation to Pyongyang, but its members were also
denied visas.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Snyder, Seoul representative of the Asia Foundation, said
the rebuff to the congressional delegation was not necessarily a
signal that North Korea does not want a dialogue with the United
States. He said the North Koreans might be waiting for the Pritchard
visit to determine what the Bush administration's policy will be.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Koreans don't really appreciate what Congress' role
is," Snyder said. "But congressmen are very persistent. They are not
used to taking no for an answer."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Finds Concern Over 'Iraq, the Sequel'</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Allies' fears about a post-Hussein regime are
blocking Bush's campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As President Bush struggles to gain international backing for a U.S.
campaign against Saddam Hussein, his own government faces a growing
list of challenges and delays in crafting a plan to oust the Iraqi
president, according to U.S. and European officials.</LD>
<LD>   A key problem revolves around the issue essential to winning even
tentative support from European and Arab allies: What happens after
Hussein is gone?</LD>
<LD>   Bush's call in a weekend speech at West Point for "preemptive
action" against terrorist threats seemed to underscore his
administration's determination to drive the Iraqi leader from power.
But as was driven home to Bush during his recent European trip, most
major allies either oppose a military operation or worry about its
impact. And they are even more alarmed about the political, economic
and security dangers that could loom once Hussein and his inner
circle are removed and others try to govern the historically unstable
nation.</LD>
<TE>   "The aftermath of a regime change in Iraq could make the problems
of Afghanistan after the Taliban look simple by comparison," a
ranking European official said. "Getting rid of Saddam is almost easy
compared with the very long-term process of re-creating Iraq. At
least 90% of the issues that worry us have to do with Iraq, the
sequel."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Is Trying to</TE>
<TE>   Strengthen Opposition</TE>
<TE>   To address these concerns, the State Department has been trying to
broaden and strengthen the Iraqi opposition. The chief goal is to
bring together Iraqi opposition leaders, military defectors,
economists and professionals--first in working groups, then at an
international conference--to develop a political strategy to
complement any military or intelligence plan to change the regime.</TE>
<TE>   This effort would signal to allies and Iraqis that the country
wouldn't face a leadership vacuum, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to start winning Iraqis and people in the region over
and make them believe there is a future and it will not be all chaos
and war," said a senior State Department official, who asked to
remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   But this initiative, like so many U.S. efforts on Iraq during the
last decade by Republican and Democratic administrations, has become
bogged down.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had hoped to hold the conference last
month. But even mobilizing working groups--on issues ranging from
avoiding a humanitarian crisis in the wake of Hussein's ouster to
operating the Iraqi oil industry--is still weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy Over Main</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Hussein Group</TE>
<TE>   The complications are reflected in the latest controversy over the
Iraqi National Congress, once the umbrella group for several
anti-Hussein movements. The INC is in jeopardy of losing some or all
of its U.S. aid because of financial mismanagement, despite the
group's pledge to correct past practices and provide a full
accounting for millions of dollars, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The INC is "basically writing checks to people in an attempt to
build its ranks and pay off people to get attendance at meetings,"
said a well-placed U.S. official, who asked to remain anonymous. "Its
entire way of doing business is in conflict with U.S. law."</TE>
<TE>   Financial mismanagement has jeopardized the INC-run Radio Liberty,
which broadcasts programs into Iraq. American officials believe that
Radio Liberty has significant propaganda potential, but it suspended
broadcasting in May when U.S. funding was held up because of the
accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department has submitted a request to Congress for an
additional $8 million to fund Radio Liberty, an INC newspaper and the
group's offices, but the money may be blocked if a probe by the
congressional inspector general's office launched last month finds
that the INC can't fully account for the millions in aid.</TE>
<TE>   Long wary of the INC, the State Department has been quietly
working for months to develop alternative leadership that won't
exclude either the group or its leader, Ahmad Chalabi. But the
diplomacy is facing staunch resistance from Pentagon and
congressional hawks who remain loyal to Chalabi, a charismatic
mathematician once indicted in Jordan on bank fraud charges who is
now based in London.</TE>
<TE>   Political, Religious</TE>
<TE>   Differences in Iraq</TE>
<TE>   A second challenge is divisions among Iraqis themselves. The seven
major groups now talking with the United States are a microcosm of
the political, religious and ethnic differences that have long
divided Iraq--and that underscore potential problems in devising a
post-Hussein regime. No individual or group is emerging, as the Bush
administration had hoped, as a rallying point.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been sorely disappointed in the lack of real leadership in
the INC and the glaring inability generally of any Iraqi opposition
leader to gather around him a critical mass of the opposition," said
an administration official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "Individually, each has pros and cons, but none of them stands out
above the crowd," the official added. "We once looked to Chalabi for
that, but he's repeatedly failed to produce."</TE>
<TE>   The most popular and powerful military defector, Gen. Nizar
Khazraji, is a former Iraqi army chief of staff fired by Hussein and
subsequently implicated in a coup attempt. He could be useful during
a U.S. military operation, as well as in a reorganization of Iraq's
military in a new regime.</TE>
<TE>   Arab newspapers have dubbed him "Iraq's Karzai," a reference to
Afghanistan's post-Taliban leader, Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   As a Sunni Muslim, Khazraji would reassure the Sunni-led
governments neighboring Iraq--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Jordan and
Turkey. Iraq has traditionally been Sunni-ruled, although the largest
segment of its population is Shiite Muslim and at least 20% of its 23
million people are Kurdish.</TE>
<TE>   Khazraji, who lives in Denmark, has talked with several Iraqi
opposition groups but belongs to none. His prospects as a leader are
clouded by allegations that units under his command killed thousands
of Iraqi Kurds and ordered the destruction of dozens of Kurdish
villages in the late 1980s. Denmark's parliament is pressing to try
him on war crimes charges, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Until the issue is resolved, the State Department has been wary
about reaching out to Khazraji. But a former senior CIA official has
met with him, reportedly on behalf of the intelligence community,
according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a single obvious person or group to lead the
Iraqi opposition, the State Department is trying to create a movement
with strength through numbers, diverse constituencies and a range of
skills needed to govern Iraq in a more democratic form.</TE>
<TE>   The most hopeful development is the recent emergence of the
so-called Group of Four--key factions engaged in informal dialogue.
All four have assets inside Iraq and together represent a
cross-section of its society. The group includes two Kurdish
movements that administer much of the north of the country and have
the only organized anti-Hussein militias.</TE>
<TE>   Sporadic tensions between the Kurdish Democratic Party and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led to infighting that allowed Hussein's
troops to invade the north in 1996--and forced the CIA and the INC to
lose an operational base they had established inside Iraq. U.S.
officials claim that the two parties now recognize that their rivalry
is counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is paying particular attention to a third member
of the group, the Iraqi National Accord, led by London-based Ayad
Alawi. He advocates tapping into Iraq's disenchanted tribal groups
and disaffected government officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Our philosophy is to disengage the civil service and the military
from Saddam and turn them against him," Alawi said. "The tribes are
also important, both to undermine him and to keep Iraq together after
he is gone."</TE>
<TE>   He ridiculed the idea of using exiles as a military force. And he
called forming a government in exile "counterproductive."</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq is the
Group of Four's only religious movement. It represents much of Iraq's
Shiite Muslim population and for years was off-limits to U.S.
officials because it is based in Iran. But it has contact with U.S.
officials through a London office.</TE>
<TE>   Merged Group Hopes</TE>
<TE>   to Build a Coalition</TE>
<TE>   Smaller opposition groups include the Iraqi National Movement,
formed in February by the merger of the Iraqi Officers Movement, led
by Gen. Fawzi Shamari, and the Iraqi National Liberals, led by Hatem
Mukhlis.</TE>
<TE>   Mukhlis is a New York physician whose father was executed by
Hussein in 1993. His family is from the same tribe and hometown as
Hussein. The merged group aims to build a coalition--particularly
among Sunni Muslim strongholds within Iraq--that "is acceptable to
the Iraqi people and will build confidence in a democratic future,"
Mukhlis said. But both leaders have been out of Iraq for years;
Mukhlis left in 1981, and Shamari defected in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Another group, the Iraqi Free Officers, is led by Gen. Najib
Salhi. He commanded an armored division against the United States
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and now lives outside Washington. He
seeks to tap into discontent within the Iraqi military.</TE>
<TE>   "What I need from the United States is a mechanism to communicate
with the military inside Iraq that Washington is serious," he said.
"This is more important than arms or money."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff researcher Robin Cochran contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Wall Street's crisis of confidence deepened Monday as investors drove
stocks to their lowest levels in eight months.</LD>
<LD>   The latest jolts came from Tyco International Ltd. and El Paso
Corp. Tyco's chief executive quit Monday amid a probe into possible
tax evasion, while the suicide Sunday of the treasurer of energy
trader El Paso stirred memories of the death of a top Enron Corp.
executive several months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's plunge, which clipped more than 200 points off the
blue-chip Dow index, was seen as the latest no-confidence vote from
investors already reeling from the Enron accounting scandal and the
collapse of the onetime energy trading giant; the widespread probe of
alleged conflicts of interest among Wall Street brokerage analysts;
and the two-year bear market that has erased two-thirds of Nasdaq's
value.</LD>
<TE>   In another sign of weakening commitment to the stock market,
figures released Monday show that corporate executives are selling a
lot more of their companies' stock than they are buying.</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely no greed left in the system, only fear," said
Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at brokerage RBC Dain
Rauscher in Minneapolis. "It's almost in fashion to be negative now,
which speaks to a big psychological change. A few years ago the mind
set was 'buy on the dips.' Now it's 'don't trust anything.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 215.46 points, or 2.2%,
to 9,709.79, in the biggest one-day drop since Feb. 4. The Nasdaq
composite index, home to many of the most widely traded technology
and telecom stocks, shed 3.3% to fall to its lowest close since Oct.
2.</TE>
<TE>   Individual investors said scandals and portfolio losses were
leaving them exasperated.</TE>
<TE>   "We are tired and we have had it," said Frank Glaser, a retiree
from Rancho Palos Verdes. "Can we trust the accounting? No. That's
been proven to us. Can we trust the brokers? Absolutely not. The
little guy is at the end of the food chain. We haven't got a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Glaser said he had stopped buying stock these days, noting: "I am
worried that the stock market is going to affect the rest of the
economy. If people start looking at their stock losses, are they
going to keep going on like nothing is wrong? I am very concerned."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, investors bent on selling stocks ignored surprisingly
upbeat economic data, in this case a report showing that U.S.
manufacturing expanded in May at the fastest pace in more than two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said continuing weakness in the dollar, which makes U.S.
securities less attractive to foreign investors, and rising unrest
along the India-Pakistan border also have spurred selling in recent
weeks. The euro and the Japanese yen rallied anew Monday versus the
dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Despite generally favorable U.S. economic news this spring, waning
investor confidence raises the specter of key market indexes sinking
below the three-year lows reached when trading resumed after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, down 2.5% on Monday to
an eight-month low, has lost 9.4% this year, putting it on pace for a
third straight down year for the first time since 1939-41.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq index is down nearly 20% this year after losing 39% in
2000 and 21% last year.</TE>
<TE>   If investors are losing faith in scandal-ridden corporate America,
executives are showing little confidence in themselves, some analysts
say: During the last eight weeks, transactions in which corporate
officers, directors and large shareholders have sold shares of their
own companies' stock have swamped purchases by more than 4 to 1, said
David Coleman, editor of the New York-based newsletter Vickers Weekly
Insider.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, stock sales by corporate executives have outnumbered
purchases by closer to 2 to 1. At the time of the market's September
lows, by comparison, the ratio of sales to purchases was a rousingly
bullish 1 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Insiders are looking for better places to put their money these
days than in their own companies," Coleman said. "We're seeing
across-the-board selling in most industries, and at the highest ratio
since the mid-1980s. This sends a dangerous signal about the market."</TE>
<TE>   Strategist Dow concurred: "They're probably depressed, just like
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Mutual fund managers say morale isn't much better in the ranks of
professional money managers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather have one big washout like October 1987. What's painful
is this daily water torture," said Beverly Hills-based Shelly J.
Meyers, manager of the Citizens Value Fund. "We're in a
headline-driven market that seems to get worse and worse on a daily
basis. Today it's Tyco and the shock of another suicide in the energy
merchant sector, tomorrow something else."</TE>
<TE>   Tyco plummeted $5.90 to $16.05 a share, leaving it down 73% year
to date, as CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski resigned after news circulated
that he is being investigated for possible sales tax evasion in New
York state.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso, meanwhile, lost $3.70 to $21.95 as Treasurer Charles
Rice's suicide rattled investors already worried about federal and
state investigations into the energy trading industry.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers said "contagious" selling was dragging down many major
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric Co., for example, which might have been expected
to get a boost from Monday's robust manufacturing data, instead slid
$1.03 to $30.11 a share as investors avoided any acquisitive
conglomerate that might be likened to Tyco, whose complex accounting
has drawn criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The market's downdraft hasn't sunk every investor. Some cashed out
months ago and are patiently waiting for a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, I put most of my pension plan in [bonds]," said
Barry Zalma, a Culver City attorney. "I'm chicken and I'm getting
older.</TE>
<TE>   "But the market will come back. When it does, I'll take money and
put it back in the marketplace."</TE>

<LD>When Lew R. Wasserman rose to power in post-World War II Hollywood,
the studios were ruled by men with names like Mayer, Warner and
Goldwyn. By the time he exited the stage decades later, Wasserman had
outstripped them all. But the Hollywood he once dominated had become
a place that no longer could create a mogul in such a singular mold.</LD>
<LD>   Although Wasserman helped bring down the old studio system, by the
end of his reign he had become something of a relic, a bridge between
Hollywood's legendary past and its corporate future, one in which
giant media conglomerates would supplant the unique culture of an
industry built on individual clout.</LD>
<LD>   Courtly, yet tough as nails, Wasserman often was called the last
of the moguls, and with good reason. His influence extended from
movies to television, music, theme parks, the Hollywood labor front
and even politics, making him one of the most respected and, in some
ways, feared men in the entertainment business.</LD>
<TE>   "What has changed vastly is the structure of the business," said
actor-director Warren Beatty, who had regular lunches with Wasserman,
the last time only a few weeks ago at Morton's.</TE>
<TE>   "When entertainment companies were not affiliated with larger
companies, they had more common interests, so it was possible for Lew
to unify those companies," Beatty said. Now, "it's very difficult to
unify the interests of the parent companies whose interests are often
legitimately disparate."</TE>
<TE>   When Wasserman arrived on the scene, stars such as Robert Taylor,
Clark Gable and Lana Turner were held in virtual economic servitude
by the studios where they were under long-term contract. Wasserman
helped break those chains. In today's system, stars such as Tom
Cruise, Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, who each command salaries of
$20 million or more a picture, routinely top the industry power lists
and exert so much influence in the moviemaking process that they are,
in many respects, mini-corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Daly, who with Terry Semel ran Warner Bros. throughout much
of the 1980s and 1990s, said no one will ever attain Wasserman's
power because the business of Hollywood has changed so drastically
since Wasserman ruled MCA and Universal.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be anyone like Lew Wasserman again because these
companies are too big," said Daly, now the Los Angeles Dodgers
chairman. "It was an industry town and totally controlled by the
studios and the networks. He was the guy that was the No. 1 guy at
the networks and the No. 1 guy in Washington for the industry."</TE>
<TE>   In those days, Daly said, it was clear who the good guys and bad
guys were. Daly characterized Wasserman as the "town marshal who made
sure the law was enforced" in what was then a simpler time.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of the old westerns because you knew who wore the
white hats and who wore the black hats," Daly said. "That's the way
the town was. It's not like that anymore. In your own companies, you
aren't sure who is wearing the black hat. In your own company people
have different agendas."</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman's power is unlikely to be rivaled in yet another arena.</TE>
<TE>   From the 1960s through the 1980s, Wasserman was the premier
political fund-raiser in Hollywood, the first contact most Democratic
politicians sought to open wallets on the West Coast. "Any time you
went to Los Angeles, one of the first calls you made was to Lew
Wasserman, and this was going on for 40 years," said longtime
Democratic fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe, now chairman of the
Democratic National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman played such a central political role partly because he
developed strong personal relations with politicians from Lyndon
Johnson to Ronald Reagan (whom he had represented as an agent decades
before) to Bill Clinton. But his influence in Washington also
depended largely on his power in Hollywood: He became the undisputed
point of contact for politicians because he was so clearly seen as
the first-among-equals among the studio chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, many analysts believe that Wasserman's
predominant political role is unlikely to be replicated. Today most
of the studios are divisions in larger entertainment conglomerates;
that has reduced the ability of the studio heads to speak for their
own companies, much less the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Haim Saban, who built an empire on "Power Rangers," is one of
Hollywood's largest Democratic Party donors. He said he wanted to
follow in Wasserman's footsteps in his desire to play a role in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "To reach the same level of influence would be very difficult
today," he said. "The system has changed. I should be so lucky that I
could fill one-tenth of Lew's shoes in the political world."</TE>
<TE>   When Wasserman was climbing the corporate ladder, Hollywood was,
in many ways, a small town where everyone knew one another and deals
were often sealed with a handshake.</TE>
<TE>   The stars and moguls would lunch together and make deals at the
Brown Derby. Movie stars often lived next to each other. Their kids
would have birthday parties together.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, there were no megaplexes. Instead, there were grand
movie palaces where films would open in one theater and run for
months--sometimes even years. Today, if a big-budget film fails to
open with huge box office success on its first weekend it is
considered a flop and quickly disappears.</TE>
<TE>   Films now are marketed for the crucial opening weekend, not unlike
a political campaign. There is no shelf life. Television also has
changed from Wasserman's early forays, with 100-plus channels and the
proliferation of broadcast, cable and satellite TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it is a different world," Saban said. "It was a world of
patriarchs, a society led by patriarchs. We are no longer led by
patriarchs. One father figure could have more influence than the
whole of AOL Time Warner" in the Hollywood of Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   Added Freddie Fields, a former agent who worked with Wasserman:
"You wonder why the most influential and respected man in this
industry would get out of the business? It's because the institution
around him was going south."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the kind of accessibility Wasserman offered is rare in the
stratospheric world of corporate conglomeration and distant boards of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   "You could call Lew Wasserman and he would take the call," onetime
Hollywood superagent Sue Mengers said. "Now, if what you wanted to
say to him turned out to be dumb, he might not take the call a second
or third time.... He was surprisingly accessible."</TE>
<TE>   By today's standards of tighter budgets and larger bureaucracies,
it also was a time of surprising simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman had "an uncanny ability to analyze the elements of a
deal on both sides and know what moves to make to get us closer to a
deal," said Ken Orsatti, a SAG national executive director for 20
years. "When an agreement was reached, you had a deal. He was an
honorable man. You knew on a handshake that that was the deal and it
wasn't going to change."</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner called Wasserman "the
conscience of the industry."</TE>
<TE>   "Not only did he understand the business, but the ethics and how
you operated and dealt with people," Eisner said. "He understood the
balance of power."</TE>
<TE>   And in that way, according to many of Wasserman's friends, the
mold has been broken.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wanted to be him, but it was too high a ladder," former
studio executive turned producer Mark Canton said. "There was never
another Lew Wasserman. He's where the buck stops. That's what the
Hall of Fame is. There won't be another Michael Jordan. There will
never be another Lew Wasserman."</TE>

Munoz also contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Troubled Waters at Gay Oasis</HD>
<DH>A whisper campaign painted the Palm Springs mayor as a
homophobe. Now the gay community seeks to repair the self-inflicted
damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>The very soul of this desert oasis was said to be at stake.</LD>
<LD>   This spring brought allegations that the mayor had turned on Palm
Springs' well-heeled, fun-loving gay community. In his handpicked
City Council candidate, some gay activists saw the makings of a
political coup that would let religious fundamentalists turn Palm
Springs into a very staid, and very straight, town.</LD>
<LD>   The divisive election that ensued is over, and the coup, if there
ever was one, was a flop. Most here, including many gay leaders,
agree that dire warnings of Palm Springs plunging back into the 1950s
were as fleeting as the dust devils that swirl, then vanish, over the
Coachella Valley floor.</LD>
<TE>   But charges of gay-bashing are easier raised than dismissed here.
Now Palm Springs is left with a nasty little image problem, arguably
of the gay community's own making.</TE>
<TE>   Some gay business organizations are quietly meeting to discuss
whether they should embark on a public relations campaign to ensure
that Palm Springs does not lose its status as an international gay
tourism mecca. The city's Human Rights Commission is preparing to
hold a community forum. And Mayor William G. Kleindienst has agreed
to sit for an interview with a prominent gay magazine in an effort to
smooth the waters.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the City Council rose as one from the dais last
month, hands clasped and raised high in a show of unity, it was clear that
the wounds will be slow to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear that people at Australian Mardi Gras parties are talking
about how Palm Springs is anti-gay," said Denise Goolsby, a lesbian
and chairwoman of the Human Rights Commission. "This really didn't
have to happen. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. It took on a life
of its own."</TE>
<TE>   Gays make up, by some estimates, a third of Palm
Springs' population of about 43,000. The city is close to the nation's
first gay retirement community. Gay veterans have their own memorial, and
the Palm Springs area--really a cluster of small towns--is home to 30
resorts that cater to gays and lesbians and a new housing development
where gay couples recently moved into 84 of 90 homes.</TE>
<TE>   All those gains gave activists a sense that they had become a part
of the establishment. And yet, some began to feel threatened last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Two of five City Council seats were open, and after the November
election, Mayor Kleindienst convened an otherwise unremarkable
meeting to swear in the winners. But then City Council member Jim
Jones suddenly resigned, citing health problems, the council was left
with an unexpected opening.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Ron Oden, who is openly gay, immediately proposed
giving the seat to the woman who had captured the third-highest vote
tally in the election. That was tradition in Palm Springs, said Oden,
who was first appointed to the City Council seven years ago in
similar fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, Deyna Hodges, had previously served 12 years on the
City Council and was seen as a friend of the gay community. She had
been a key backer of the successful drive to secure domestic partner
benefits for city employees.</TE>
<TE>   But the mayor, who did not return repeated calls requesting
comment for this story, said it would be unfair to simply appoint
Hodges to the seat. Instead, he said he would back local accountant
Michael McCulloch, forcing a special election this spring, pitting
Hodges against McCulloch.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation began percolating that Kleindienst was trying to gain
a council majority for a more conservative vision of Palm Springs. He
already had one ardent supporter on the five-member City Council in
architect Chris Mills.</TE>
<TE>   As the special election approached this spring, gay leaders were
busy preparing for the annual White Party, a so-called circuit party
that has drawn an estimated 30,000 gays from across the world. This
year, it happened to coincide with the Dinah Shore event, nominally
attached to a women's professional golf tournament and considered
something of a lesbian companion to the White Party.</TE>
<TE>   When Kleindienst declined to sign proclamations welcoming the
parties, the floodgates opened.</TE>
<TE>   "The telephone game began. The whispers. And then it got
bigger and bigger," said Goolsby, the longtime owner of the Bee Charmer
Inn, a women's hotel, before she sold it recently.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, 'the White Party is not coming back to Palm
Springs' and 'the mayor is anti-gay.' All of a sudden, it's a
'right-wing conspiracy.'"</TE>
<TE>   Gay activists noted that the mayor attends Desert Chapel, a local
church associated with the International Church of the Foursquare
Gospel. According to the Foursquare Gospel's Web site, the
organization is opposed to abortion rights and the teaching of
evolution and is opposed to homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   The ties of the purported new majority of the City Council to the
Desert Chapel (whose pastor, Fred Donaldson, did not return phone
calls seeking comment) did not end there.</TE>
<TE>   Mills, seen as the mayor's right-hand man, worked on the
architecture of the chapel's sanctuary and coached a junior high
girl's basketball team there.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's wife, Kathy Kleindienst, owner of a successful Palm
Springs escrow company, is a more avid member of the church, the
mayor has said.</TE>
<TE>   Snooping around her office, the mayor's critics discovered
publications with articles seen as offensive to Jews and supporting
the contention that gays can transition into heterosexuals by
embracing Jesus Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Kleindienst said in an interview that the magazines were
primarily copies of Decision, published by the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Assn. One recent issue contained an article by a woman
who said her homosexuality was healed 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I have lots of magazines in the lobby," she said. "People can
pick up whichever magazine they want."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to weigh in on the brouhaha over the election, Kathy
Kleindienst said she does not discuss civic affairs in public,
adding: "I'm simply the spouse."</TE>
<TE>   But keeping such magazines "was a bad business move and a bad
political move," said Charlie Sharples, a retired hotel owner, and
president of the Desert Business Assn., a gay chamber of commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kleindienst has made no secret of the fact that he may
eventually run for Congress or some higher office. Was he trying to
appeal to the Republican right, a strong force in the area's
politics? After all, many old-timers prefer not the Palm Springs of
raves and gay conclaves but the Palm Springs of Lucille Ball, honored
with a downtown statue, and of Francis Albert Sinatra, as the small
gravestone reads in nearby Cathedral City. After all, Republicans
still outnumber Democrats in the Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   One gay Web site predicted that "If Deyna Hodges does not win ...
Palm Springs will be ruled by gay-bashers." By the time the election
rolled around, Hodges' supporters were claiming outright that
Kleindienst was a homophobe, which he fervently denied.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Hodges won in a landslide, capturing more than
two-thirds of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   But after the victory came the hangover.</TE>
<TE>   Upon reflection, maybe the mayor had a point about the White
Party. He had said his beef was based on its troublesome history with
drug abuse, not a hidden agenda about gays.</TE>
<TE>   Though this year's party was a more law-abiding affair, police
reported more than a dozen overdoses last year, and tales were
rampant of ecstasy and other drugs flowing at all-night bacchanals.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that there is a drug problem, and it is very specific
to the White Party," said Jack Schloeder president of Greater Palm
Springs Pride, which runs the town's annual gay pride festival.</TE>
<TE>   Hodges' supporters were also overlooking the mayor's record, said
Tom Swann, a Rancho Mirage resident and the co-chairman of Gay
Liberation for the 21st Century.</TE>
<TE>   Swann recalled that many veterans' organizations aligned
against his gay veterans group when it applied three years ago to march in
the Palm Springs Veterans Day parade. Kleindienst "made the decision
to support us, and he probably lost a couple of votes for it," Swann
said. "Now the gay veterans are in the parade every year. That took
some courage."</TE>
<TE>   The fear now is that Palm Springs' lucrative gay tourism industry
is at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Gay parties bring thousands of visitors to town, many of them
affluent professionals. If gays at Australian Mardi Gras parties are
convinced Palm Springs has become anti-gay, the word is clearly
getting out.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a real positive image for Palm Springs," Hodges said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's reputation as "an open, accepting community has been
tarnished to some degree," Oden said.</TE>
<TE>   Some gay organizations scheduled meetings to discuss whether they
should embark on a campaign to remind the gay community that it's
still OK to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Other gay business leaders, reflecting the deep division within
their community, recently traded angry e-mails over whether to
boycott a weekend event at the mayor's house.</TE>
<TE>   "I am ashamed to belong to a community that has so quickly
forgotten what it is to be singled out and discriminated [against]
themselves," wrote Charlie Robles, a hotelier.</TE>
<TE>   Sharples, the president of the Desert Business Assn. and one of
those who still insists the mayor erred, responded in an e-mail that
he fears Palm Springs will go the way of Key West--which has
shouldered what some have described as a gay exodus because of
perceptions that it had become less tolerant.</TE>
<TE>   Already, many White Party events reported lower attendance this
year, after the mayor's criticism of drug use. Attendance at the Tea
Dance, one of the main events, fell by nearly 3,000 people,
organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Reports from around the world say that Palm Springs is now not
gay friendly," Sharples wrote in an e-mail this month to gay leaders
who had criticized his hard-line stance. "That damage is difficult to
repair."</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent attempt to clear the air, Kleindienst has agreed to
an interview with the Bottom Line, a gay magazine distributed
throughout the Coachella Valley. It's all damage control--from a
conflict many believe never should have occurred in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Gay leaders say it's too early to tell whether the impact on gay
tourism will be real. In the end, most hold out hope that Palm
Springs will wind up like it has been for years--diverse, quirky and
carefree.</TE>
<TE>   "Through thick and thin, [Palm Springs] returns to this fairy tale
village," said Michael Andrunas, founder of Out on Film, the company
that runs the Palm Springs Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. "Things
just got a little out of hand this time."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The death of former MCA chief Lew R. Wasserman on Monday rumbled
through  Washington almost as powerfully as it did Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   In the decades from Lyndon Johnson through Bill Clinton, Wasserman
probably did more than anyone in the movie industry to build the road
that now runs between the two cities.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning under Johnson in the 1960s, Wasserman both established
the expectation that movie executives would cultivate friendships
with politicians and demonstrated how to do so.</LD>
<TE>   In his heyday, Wasserman was by far the most effective fund-raiser
in Hollywood, perhaps the most effective in Hollywood's history. But
he also became a trusted intimate of political leaders who prized his
experience and discretion. Johnson, according to one account, offered
to make him secretary of Commerce; Clinton came to see him as a close
friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure other presidents had the same experience: I just wanted
to listen to him talk," Clinton said Monday. "I was never around him
when I didn't have a good time, and learn something from it, and was
elevated by it."</TE>
<TE>   Added Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee: "He was in a class and a league by himself."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood was a source of money for politicians long before
Wasserman. But it was Wasserman, together with the late Arthur B.
Krim, former head of United Artists Corp., who defined the modern
style of Hollywood fund-raising--the foundation of the industry's
political influence.</TE>
<TE>   The generation of moguls who founded Hollywood built their
political influence on their autocratic control of their studios. At
a time when the studios held writers, directors and even stars under
binding contracts, the studio chiefs had enormous leverage to coerce
contributions for their candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But in the 1950s, economics unraveled the old studio system, which
greatly reduced the political influence of the moguls. More than
anyone it was Krim, based in New York, and Wasserman, in Los Angeles,
who filled the vacuum. Both recognized that modern campaigns needed
so much money that the most successful fund-raisers--and thus the
most influential men--were those who could reach beyond their own
studios, and the industry itself, and extract money from other local
powers.</TE>
<TE>   It was Krim, a key fund-raiser for John F. Kennedy, who first
recruited Wasserman into national politics. Jules C. Stein, who
founded MCA, had for years kept the company away from politics. But
as MCA morphed beyond a conventional talent agency through the
1950s--producing television shows and eventually acquiring Universal
Pictures--politics found the company; under Kennedy, the Justice
Department filed an antitrust suit that forced the firm to dissolve
its talent agency after it bought Universal.</TE>
<TE>   For Wasserman, the government's intervention was a traumatic
event. By company legend, it was the act that inspired Wasserman to
shed his political passivity and begin acquiring the allies that
could prevent a recurrence.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman first appeared on the national stage in June 1963, when
he served as host of a $1,000-a-plate dinner at the Beverly Hilton
hotel for the President's Club--a fund-raising vehicle for Kennedy
that Krim had established. But Wasserman fully emerged as a force in
the 1964 Lyndon Johnson campaign. Early in the race, Wasserman was
still such a secondary figure that a White House thank-you letter was
returned because it was sent to the wrong address. But by the
election's end, he had proved his skill by raising unprecedented
amounts in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Although a staunch Democrat, Wasserman also had a long-standing
relationship with Ronald Reagan, whom he had represented when Reagan
was an actor. Michael K. Deaver, Reagan's longtime aide, said Reagan
had for many years been estranged from Wasserman by the time he won
the presidency, largely because he felt Wasserman had foisted him off
on another MCA agent at the lowest point in his career. But Wasserman
rebuilt the relationship while Reagan was president, to the point
that when Reagan returned to private life in Los Angeles, the first
man he sat down with for lunch was Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   For all his personal relationships with politicians, Wasserman
never lost sight of his business interests. And he could be just as
forceful at presenting his views in Washington as in Hollywood, where
his temper was legendary.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Wasserman almost always found time to meet not only with
political heavyweights who could do him favors but also those just
starting out. One of them was Clinton, then governor of Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him if he would give me some advice about how I could get
more movies made in Arkansas," Clinton said. "He didn't know me from
Adam. He certainly couldn't have known I would be president. And he
sat and talked to me for 30 or 45 minutes, like I was the most
important person in the world."</TE>
<TE>   During the last decade, Wasserman scaled back his political
activity; others, such as DreamWorks SKG's David Geffen, became more
central to Democratic efforts. But Wasserman remained a powerful
player, even after he stepped down from MCA in 1995. From 1991
through his death, Wasserman personally gave $1.4 million to
candidates and party committees--all but $6,500 of it to Democrats,
said Dwight Morris, a consultant on campaign finance for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Ambitious, sometimes fierce and always self-contained, Wasserman
in his prime was as hard and inscrutable as the featureless black
tower in Universal City in which he headquartered his empire. But in
his final years, he spent hours reminiscing with visitors such as
McAuliffe and Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "He talked to me about other presidents," Clinton said. "He wasn't
a gossip. He told stories to illustrate how he thought things ought
to be done, how he thought problems ought to be solved. I always
hated to leave when I was at his home."</TE>

<HD>The Hollywood Mogul and Kingmaker Dies at 89</HD>
<DH>Legacy: As MCA chief, his behind-the-scenes clout guided an
industry and extended to politics.</DH>

<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lew R. Wasserman, a onetime theater usher and talent agent who
emerged as the most powerful mogul in post-World War II Hollywood,
died Monday morning at his Beverly Hills home from complications of a
stroke. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Wasserman's health had deteriorated since May 17, when he suffered
the stroke. In keeping with his intensely private life, Wasserman's
family held services late Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Effectively detached from the business for the last seven years,
Wasserman was still Hollywood's patriarch, his advice sought by
executives, union leaders and politicians. His death marks the
symbolic passing of an era in Hollywood that is unlikely to be
repeated. Both feared and respected, Wasserman single-handedly
wielded the kind of behind-the-scenes clout that could settle labor
disputes, bring together studios with conflicting agendas and
influence power brokers in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   "For decades he was the chief justice of the film industry--fair,
tough-minded, and innovative. I feel that all of us have lost our
benevolent godfather," director Steven Spielberg said.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the former MCA Inc., Wasserman built the prototype of
today's entertainment conglomerates, meshing entertainment units
together while leveraging successes in one area, such as movies, into
profitable ventures in other businesses, such as theme parks and
television. As an agent, he forged a landmark deal for actor James
Stewart giving the star a piece of the profits and wide-ranging
creative control, power that top stars today take for granted.</TE>
<TE>   He put together a company that boasted a movie studio that gave
Spielberg his break with "Jaws" and also released such Spielberg hits
as "Jurassic Park," "E.T.--the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Schindler's
List." Other films released during Wasserman's tenure included the
Oscar-winning "Out of Africa," "American Graffiti," and comedies such
as the raunchy "Animal House."</TE>
<TE>   When other Hollywood figures viewed television in its infancy as a
threat to the motion picture studios, Wasserman saw its promise and
embraced it, operating a television division that over the years
produced such hit shows as "Kojak," "Miami Vice" and "Coach." MCA's
music conglomerate boasted top acts across the spectrum, including
Nirvana, Reba McEntire and Elton John. The Universal Studios theme
park Wasserman built attracted millions of visitors to Southern
California each year from around the world, luring them with the
glamour of touring a studio back lot where films were made.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman's imprint went well beyond the entertainment business
and into politics. Smarting from a 1962 deal with the federal
government forcing him to divest his talent agency business from
MCA's movie operations, Wasserman vowed never to let something like
that happen again and immersed himself in the workings of government.</TE>
<TE>   A confidant of presidents and world leaders, Wasserman correctly
sensed that money and access to stars spoke volumes with politicians.
He became Hollywood's most skillful executive at raising campaign
funds and at forging ties to top politicians in Washington,
Sacramento and at Los Angeles City Hall. From his office on the 15th
floor of MCA's Black Tower that now carries his name in Universal
City, Wasserman, with a handful of phone calls, could rally Hollywood
to raise millions for candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Even the most powerful of moguls rarely turned down a personal
appeal from Wasserman. He became the most important fund-raiser in
Hollywood in an era when huge sums were needed to buy television ads
and conduct national campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   He was one of the first Hollywood executives to get to know Bill
Clinton when the future president was a relatively unknown Arkansas
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Dodgers Chairman Robert Daly, former head of rival
Warner Bros., recalled that when President Clinton visited Daly's
home for a fund-raiser, his first words were, "Is Lew here?" Clinton
then sought out Wasserman before talking to anyone else, Daly
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the smartest men I ever met, and in more than
intellectual ways. He just came across as someone who understood what
life was all about and was pulling for people to have good lives,"
Clinton told The Times on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Although a passionate liberal Democrat, Wasserman's voice was
heard by both parties. Indeed, at no time was his clout seemingly
greater than it was during the Republican-dominated 1980s, when a
former B-actor Wasserman once represented as an agent, Ronald Reagan,
occupied the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "Lew was Ronnie's first agent in Hollywood and they became fast
friends," former First Lady Nancy Reagan said in a statement Monday
about their friendship of more than 60 years. "He gave Ronnie some of
the best advice in the business. It seems no matter where we've
been--Sacramento, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles--Lew Wasserman was
always there for us."</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman also was a prolific fund-raiser for philanthropic causes
such as the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund in Woodland Hills, which
cares for aging actors and others in the industry. He and his wife,
Edie, also gave substantial amounts to the $40-million Edie and Lew
Wasserman Eye Research Center building, which will join the complex
of the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA named for Wasserman's
mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of business and political leaders issued statements after
learning of Wasserman's death. Sen. Barbara Boxer called Wasserman "a
role model." Gov. Gray Davis said Wasserman "was the Democratic
Party's most important business leader." Sen. Dianne Feinstein said,
"Lew set a high standard. It will be interesting to see who can meet
it."</TE>
<TE>   Motion Picture Assn. of America President Jack Valenti, who said
he owes his 1966 hiring as the industry's chief lobbyist to
Wasserman, said Monday: "He was the tallest redwood in the Hollywood
forest, and there's nobody else around. I guess Lew becomes a
mythical, legendary figure and the industry is going to miss the hell
out of him."</TE>
<TE>   Tall, tan and slender, Wasserman was always immaculately dressed
in a dark suit, his gray hair slicked back and his oversized black
spectacles perched on his nose. His daily routine rarely varied.
Rising at 5 a.m. to call the East Coast, the indefatigable Wasserman
worked 60-hour weeks. He ate lunch nearly every day at the same
corner table of the Universal commissary, bantering with waitresses
and employees of all levels while eating tuna salad. This continued
well into his retirement and only stopped after his recent stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Outwardly, Wasserman ruled with a quiet style that belied his
power. In contrast to many of today's Hollywood executives who employ
personal publicists, Wasserman almost never granted interviews. When
he did, he revealed little.</TE>
<TE>   In private, however, his temper was legendary. Executives who
worked for him knew that the smallest of details wouldn't escape him,
and some to this day talk of being grilled in the elevator in the
morning about such details as unexpected expenses on a film the day
before.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his retirement, Wasserman immersed himself in details of
the industry he helped shape, having at his recall box office grosses
and theme park attendance numbers. During the labor tensions last
year, when major studios were negotiating with writers and actors,
Wasserman took an active interest, privately advising both sides to
compromise without a devastating strike.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman would entertain lunch guests with stories about
Hollywood's halcyon days: Alfred Hitchcock's pranks, the difficulties
he had as a talent agent handling temperamental stars such as Joan
Crawford, or the time that mogul Jack Warner had him banned from the
Warner Bros. lot--until stars Wasserman represented such as Bette
Davis made it clear that was unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a loyal and good friend, and someone that could be as
tough as anybody in negotiations," said actress Janet Leigh, whom
Wasserman represented. "But he also could be the kind of person who
could push you into a pool at a Sunday barbecue. He was a hard
businessman, but he was also fun."</TE>
<TE>   Daly recalled taking Wasserman on a tour of the Warner Bros. lot
and museum only to find that Wasserman was as knowledgeable as the
tour guide. "The guy on the tour would start a story about a
particular star, and Lew would finish it because he had been their
agent," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   He was born Lewis Robert Wasserman on March 15, 1913, in his
family home in Cleveland. His parents were Isaac and Minnie
Weiserman, who had fled Russia five years earlier, changing their
last name to Wasserman. Wasserman's father worked as a store clerk.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman began his career in show business while in high school,
working as an usher at the Palace Theater in Cleveland. He wanted to
attend Ohio State University or Case Western Reserve after graduating
from high school in 1930, but couldn't afford it amid the Great
Depression. Indeed, his inability to afford college inspired
Wasserman in 1998 to donate $8.75 million for undergraduate
scholarships at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman later worked in advertising and promotion for a
Cleveland nightclub that booked bands through the Music Corp. of
America, founded by a former ophthalmologist, Dr. Jules C. Stein. In
1936, Stein hired Wasserman for $60 a week as his national director
of advertising and public relations, and Wasserman became Stein's
protege.</TE>
<TE>   "The job has a great future," Wasserman told his bride, the former
Edie Beckerman. "What's so great about it?" she asked. "Stein,"
replied the 23-year-old Wasserman, "is 40. He is an old man."</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, Stein turned over the presidency of MCA to
Wasserman, then just 33. The two continued a close association until
Stein's death in 1981 at age 85.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, MCA was the largest talent agency in the band
business, representing such stars as Tommy Dorsey and Kay Kyser, and
building a growing business of movie stars such as Davis, Errol Flynn
and James Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   The deal Wasserman negotiated for Stewart in 1950 for the film
"Winchester 73" foreshadowed today's contracts in which top actors
have not only a financial stake in a film's success but also
wide-ranging creative control. For that film, Wasserman got Stewart a
piece of the film's profits, made sure his name appeared on screen
before the film title, and gave him the right to pick the director
and his co-stars.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman and Stein together built the world's largest talent
agency, and after that a giant motion picture and television company
with one of the largest film libraries anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman bought the Universal Pictures lot in North Hollywood in
1959, then acquired Universal Studios and its parent company, Decca
Records, three years later. The acquisition drew attention from the
U.S. Justice Department, which charged that MCA couldn't represent
talent while owning a studio and producing television. MCA signed a
consent decree, agreeing to dissolve the talent agency business that
had given the company its start.</TE>
<TE>   It was Wasserman's bitter experience with that deal that made him
realize the importance of political clout, causing him to become a
voracious fund-raiser and student of the political scene.</TE>
<TE>   He turned down a Cabinet job offer from President Lyndon B.
Johnson, who wanted him as his secretary of Commerce. Wasserman later
was active in developing the late president's library in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Monday, Lady Bird Johnson and her daughters, Luci
Baines Johnson and Lynda Johnson Robb, said that Wasserman "stood at
the pinnacle of beloved Johnson family friends."</TE>
<TE>   MCA's far-reaching power in entertainment and politics led to its
nickname, "The Octopus," and Wasserman's critics argued that he
sometimes abused his power. In "Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and
the Mob," author Dan Moldea described Reagan's early 1960s grand jury
testimony, according to documents obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act. Reagan, according to the book, told grand jurors
probing possible antitrust violations that he could not recall
details of a 1952 waiver that the Screen Actors Guild granted MCA
while Reagan was the guild's president. That waiver allowed MCA to
produce TV programs while representing actors, which critics said was
a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   When he was asked if he had discussed it with Wasserman, Moldea
wrote, Reagan is reported to have told the grand jury that he may
have only mentioned it socially. According to Moldea's book, MCA
later arranged jobs for Reagan in Las Vegas and paid him $100,000 a
year as the host of its "GE Theater." Still, Reagan was cleared of
any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   No criminal charges were filed against anyone in the probe, and an
antitrust division attorney wrote at the close of the investigation,
according to an Associated Press account, "It was thought at the
beginning of the grand jury that SAG might have purposely favored MCA
for some illegal consideration. However, the evidence does not show
any such improper purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Other biographers would note Wasserman's friendships with the late
lawyer Sidney Korshak, identified in congressional testimony as the
liaison between Hollywood and the Chicago mob. In addition, MCA
during the 1980s was plagued by investigations into ties between
alleged organized crime figures and some of its operating units,
although no MCA executives were ever charged in that probe.</TE>
<TE>   Having worked in entertainment since the Great Depression,
Wasserman was rarely fazed by threats to the business or dire
predictions from pundits. He ignored predictions that television
would be the death of film studios, instead plunging into the
business.</TE>
<TE>   "Every new medium has brought predictions of the death of every
other," he said once. "Radio was said to be all washed up, but
stations are selling for higher prices than ever. When television
came along, the studios were prepared to sell all their product, fire
their people and fold up."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Wasserman's words of some 30 years ago sound much like the
mantras of today's media moguls who talk endlessly about creating
entertainment "content" that can be exploited as widely as possible.
Wasserman then said MCA should "create sources of supply" in all
areas of entertainment through Universal Pictures, Universal
Television and record and music publishing.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman's exit from the business evolved over several years
starting in 1990, when MCA Inc., then a publicly traded company
headed by Wasserman, was sold to Japan's Matsushita Electric
Industrial for $6.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although he stayed on as chief executive, Wasserman's new Japanese
bosses frustrated the mogul and his longtime second-in-command, MCA
President Sidney J. Sheinberg.</TE>
<TE>   The two felt Matsushita frequently undercut them, spurning their
efforts to expand MCA through such promising deals as acquiring the
CBS television network. Reacting to Wasserman's death, Sheinberg
said: "The image that comes to my mind is that this giant tree has
fallen."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the bitter falling out with Matsushita, liquor
giant Seagram Co. in 1995 bought 80% of MCA for $5.7 billion.
Although Seagram gave him the symbolic title of chairman emeritus,
Wasserman was effectively pushed aside and rarely consulted. Although
frustrated, he never expressed it publicly. At the same time,
Wasserman's health began to deteriorate, with a painful knee problem
that limited his mobility. Seagram renamed the company Universal
Studios Inc., selling it in 2000 to France's Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of his life, Wasserman continued to host political
fund-raisers. But his presence was missed in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   No executive emerged to take on the statesman-like role that
Wasserman held, one that allowed him to speak without challenge for
the entire industry on political, labor and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Lew had become a god in Hollywood, but an old and tired god,"
wrote Dennis McDougal, author of "The Last Mogul," an unauthorized
biography of Wasserman in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The sales of MCA made Wasserman a wealthy man, with the most
recent estimate of his net worth coming in 1998 when Forbes pegged it
at $500 million. In later years, Wasserman became especially close to
his grandson, Casey Wasserman, making him president of his foundation
and considering bankrolling a National Football League franchise in
Los Angeles with him.</TE>
<TE>   Lew and Edie Wasserman were instrumental in raising money,
especially for the Motion Picture &amp; Television Hospital in Woodland
Hills. Wasserman helped Dorothy Chandler raise money to build the
Music Center. He also was active for the foundation Research to
Prevent Blindness, one reason he was awarded in 1995 the Presidential
Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor, by Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman was a director of the Music Center, founding president
of the Center Theatre Group, chairman emeritus of the Assn. of Motion
Picture and TV Producers, and trustee of the John F. Kennedy Library,
John F. Kennedy Center of Performing Arts and California Institute of
Technology. He was a recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian
Award of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science in 1973. He
was active in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, and introduced Pope
John Paul II during a speech to Hollywood leaders when the pontiff
visited in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman leaves his wife and daughter, Lynne Kay Wasserman,
grandson Casey and granddaughter Carol Leif.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to the
Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service for Wasserman will likely be scheduled in the
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Jane Allen, Mark Z. Barabak, Ronald Brownstein
and Lorenza Munoz contributed to this story.</TE>

<LD>Prosecutors wrapped up their case against Providence Mayor Vincent A.
Cianci Jr. with a seventh day of testimony from a businessman
recruited by the FBI to tape alleged illegal dealings with city
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ernest C. Torres excused the jury for the day to consider
defense motions seeking dismissal of charges.</LD>
<LD>   Asst. U.S. Atty. Richard Rose tried to leave jurors with his
contention that businessman Antonio Freitas paid bribes to top
officials in the Cianci administration.</LD>
<TE>   Cianci, his former top aide Frank Corrente and two are charged
with racketeering, extortion, bribery, witness tampering and mail
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Freitas, an air conditioning supplier, made the tapes from April
1998 to April 1999. Two of the tapes show Corrente apparently taking
a pair of $1,000 bribes in his City Hall office.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling is expected today on the motion.</TE>

<HD>FBI Is Improving, Bush Says Ahead of Terrorism Hearings</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Assertion will likely spark skepticism in
Congress. President acknowledges his team has 'some work to do' to
help prevent attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.</DL>
<LD>On the eve of congressional hearings into intelligence failures
before Sept. 11, President Bush said the FBI and CIA are doing a
better job of sharing information but acknowledged that his
administration has "got some work to do."</LD>
<LD>   Bush expressed confidence that the besieged FBI is reshaping its
mission to better predict and prevent terrorist attacks. "When you
read about the FBI, I want you to know that the FBI is changing its
culture," Bush told a rally of about 2,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   The president's remarks were among his most extensive on
intelligence gathering in connection with the terrorist attacks.
Coming just days after the Justice Department announced a major
expansion and restructuring of the FBI's counter-terrorism operation,
the comments stressed the progress his administration has made in
detecting terrorism--even as it braces for stepped-up criticism from
members of Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Bush said that while the FBI previously focused on identifying
spies and fighting white-collar crime, "now they've got a more
important task, and that is to prevent further attack. And ...
they're doing a better job of communicating with the CIA. They're now
sharing intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   That assertion is likely to spark a skeptical response from some
members of Congress, who conduct hearings this week on intelligence
failures surrounding Sept. 11. A joint Senate-House panel on
intelligence begins meeting today behind closed doors, and the Senate
Judiciary Committee will hear public testimony Thursday from FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III and Minneapolis FBI lawyer Coleen
Rowley. She wrote a scathing critique last month of the bureau's
handling of the investigation of French-born Zacarias Moussaoui, a
flight training student now alleged to have been the "20th hijacker."</TE>
<TE>   A senior congressional aide who asked not to be identified said
that lawmakers have heard claims of better cooperation between the
CIA and the FBI many times before.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same old story," the aide said. "After every crisis, we
always hear about unprecedented cooperation and new
intelligence-sharing. The real question is how effective it's going
to be and whether it's being used and disseminated."</TE>
<TE>   Huge Turf Battles</TE>
<TE>   The CIA and the FBI have had notorious turf battles for decades,
with each accusing the other of withholding vital information.</TE>
<TE>   The latest flap, surfacing over the weekend, centers on what the
CIA knew in early 2001 about the terrorist ties of Khalid Almihdhar
and Nawaf Alhazmi--two of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11
attacks--and why the agency waited until Aug. 23, 2001, to alert the
FBI to be on the lookout for them.</TE>
<TE>   Almihdhar and Alhazmi were living in San Diego at the time, but
the FBI was unable to find them in the short time before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   What this says about relations between the CIA and the FBI will
likely draw intense scrutiny during Mueller's questioning Thursday,
according to a Senate Judiciary Committee aide who asked not to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members also will be keenly interested in hearing from
Rowley about the problems she has said contributed to the failure of
her FBI supervisors in Washington to aggressively pursue an
investigation of Moussaoui, the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the hearings should offer the chance to gauge
political support for Mueller. Although he took over as FBI director
just eight days before Sept. 11, he has been tarnished by the recent
revelations about missed warning signals.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal, an influential conservative voice, called
last week for Mueller's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller Gets Support</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, the FBI Agents Assn. gave Mueller a vote of
confidence. The group, with 10,100 members, said that Mueller
"deserves support for these needed reform initiatives" he has
proposed, "not calls for his resignation."</TE>
<TE>   Bush made no mention of Mueller in his speech at the rally for
Arkansas Republican politicians, but he made clear that he
expects--and believes he is seeing--improvements in collecting
intelligence on terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "In this new war, against this shadowy enemy, it's very important
that we gather as much intelligence as we can," Bush said. "We need
to know what they're thinking, and what they're planning on doing,
before they do something."</TE>
<TE>   He also said: "We know we've got to do a better job on our
borders, understanding who's coming into the country and who's
leaving and why they're here, and why they haven't left."</TE>
<TE>   Reports of Gaps</TE>
<TE>   As the debate in Washington intensifies about the intelligence
community's performance before Sept. 11, White House officials took
pains not to point fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Bush had any reaction to the latest reports of gaps
in the sharing of information, deputy press secretary Scott McClellan
said that Congress, with its oversight responsibility, was the proper
body to examine what might have gone wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus remains on preventing future attacks in America against
Americans," McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in his speech in Little Rock, reiterated his vow that the
United States would take "preemptive action" against terrorists--a
policy he spelled out in a speech Saturday at the U.S. Military
Academy in West Point, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "The enemy ... knows that I'm really serious when it comes to
routing out harm before it hits America," he said Monday. "I don't
know whether that's good or bad they know that, but they're learning
that."</TE>
<TE>   The president said the best defense for the nation "is to go on
the offense."</TE>
<TE>   During his visit to Arkansas, Bush also sought to pressure the
Democratic-controlled Senate to act soon on a measure passed by the
House that would renew and toughen the 1996 welfare reform law.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare Bill Considered</TE>
<TE>   The House bill, patterned after administration recommendations,
would stiffen work requirements for welfare recipients and provide
hundreds of millions of dollars to promote marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's focus on the issue coincided with the release of the annual
government report on welfare statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The report, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services,
said that the percentage of the population dependent on welfare had
dropped from 5.2% to 3.3% in the three years ending in 1999, the most
recent year for which the data are available.</TE>
<TE>   The drop coincided with a surge in economic growth and an overall
drop in unemployment during those years.</TE>
<TE>   But Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson told
reporters that the rate has continued to drop, falling a full
percentage point since then.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Details Warming Threat but Defends Its Policy</HD>
<DH>Climate: Bush report to U.N. outlines greenhouse gas
dangers yet refuses to call for stronger remedies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Monday described in its starkest terms the
potentially serious consequences of global warming, but it did not
call for any stronger efforts to combat the problem than those it has
already proposed.</LD>
<LD>   The report, submitted to the United Nations, stated that the
climate changes of recent decades "are likely due mostly to human
activities." But it projected that the United States, already the
world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases, would emit 43% more of
such gases in 2020 than in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, President Bush outlined a policy to prod
businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions voluntarily. That
approach, he said, would slow the growth without damaging the
economy. Requiring businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he
said, would hurt the nation's economy.</LD>
<TE>   Experts said Monday's report revealed a glaring mismatch between
the administration's own estimate of the scale of the problem and the
president's efforts to deal with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I do see a disconnect; there has to be more of an action plan,"
said UC Irvine Chancellor Ralph J. Cicerone, who headed a recent
National Academy of Sciences panel on climate change.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of outlining new goals, the administration defended
its current policy in the report, which was required as part of the
1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by the
president's father.</TE>
<TE>   "What strikes me about this report is that it says that the
climate is changing, it's going to have a serious impact on the
United States and here's my way of dealing with it: Do nothing," said
Eileen Claussen, director of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change,
which works with businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "It
is quite amazing."</TE>
<TE>   White House officials disputed the notion that the Bush
administration's policy did not jibe with their interpretation of the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always said that climate change is a serious issue," said
White House spokesman Scott McClellan. "That's why the president has
a plan to address it; that's why we're investing $4.5 billion in the
fiscal 2003 budget."</TE>
<TE>   Much of that money will pay for research that will help the
administration better understand the challenges ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a sudden revelation here and it's not a new policy of
any kind," said Joe Martyak, Environmental Protection Agency
spokesman. "We've always known that man contributed. But there's a
lot of uncertainty about just how much comes from the human
contributions."</TE>
<TE>   The report was released on the same day that all 15 European Union
nations ratified the Kyoto treaty, in which about 40 countries agreed
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2% below 1990
levels. Several other countries, including Japan, Russia and Canada,
are expected to follow suit soon.</TE>
<TE>   Bush pulled the United States out of that treaty early last year
and, reversing a campaign promise, rejected a plan to regulate
emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants. Scientists believe
that carbon dioxide is the major contributor to global warming from
human activities, and 40% of the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions come
from power plants.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons Bush cited for rejecting that accord was that
it did not require developing nations to commit to emission
reductions. But Cicerone said the White House could more easily lead
the developing countries to make smart decisions about the future if
it adopted a more aggressive policy of its own.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not easy," Cicerone said. "I do not want to ridicule the
White House or any other group. But we do have to convince the White
House to take bigger steps...."</TE>

<HD>Washington Museum to Open Largest Egypt Exhibit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The largest collection of antiquities Egypt has ever sent to the
United States--including a life-size reconstruction of the burial
chamber of the pharaoh known as "the Napoleon of Egypt"--will go on
display at the National Gallery of Art on June 30.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibit, called "The Quest for Immortality: Treasures of
Ancient Egypt," will feature 115 artifacts.The exhibit will tour the
U.S. for five years. After four months it will travel to Boston, New
Orleans, Denver and Houston.</LD>
<LD>   The personality at the heart of the exhibit is Pharaoh Thutmose
III, a warrior and king who ruled Egypt from about 1479 to 1425 B.C.
and was a central figure in what is known as the New Kingdom, one of
Egypt's golden ages.</LD>
<TE>   Thutmose III's record of military victories helped solidify his
kingdom, and he also initiated a broad and aggressive building
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   One of his landmark projects was a shrine built within the
confines of the famous Temple of Karnak.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition was organized by Erik Hornung, professor emeritus
of Egyptology at the University of Basel, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   The artifacts are drawn mainly from the excavated possessions of
pharaohs and royals and include gold figurines representing the gods,
gold funerary masks, fragments of an obelisk and sculpture, such as
the sphinx of Thutmose III.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations for the show started a year and a half ago,
according to officials. But the gallery decided to withhold the
announcement until only four weeks before the opening--an unusually
short window for any major show--because arrangements were not
complete until a few weeks ago.</TE>

<HD>Blaze Claims Dozens of Colo. Homes</HD>
<DH>Destruction: Residents tell of narrow escapes from
wind-whipped flames. In another part of the state, fire burns near
methane gas wells.</DH>

<DL>COTOPAXI, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Stunned homeowners surveyed the charred path of a voracious forest
fire Monday that within 24 hours leveled at least 81 homes so quickly
that residents raced to flee ahead of the flames.</LD>
<LD>   "How do I feel? I don't know. I'm in shock," said Kevin Gobell,
who lost his home. He said he stood Monday on its foundation, the
only remaining trace of the structure.</LD>
<LD>   Lin Frost said she and her husband awoke from a nap Sunday
afternoon, heard commotion and went outdoors to discover a
heart-grabbing sight: "Our neighbor was running down his driveway,
waving his arms and screaming, 'We're on fire!' I looked up and saw
enormous columns of black smoke coming up. It was breathtaking."</LD>
<TE>   The blaze, on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains 130 miles
southwest of Denver, is called the Iron Mountain fire. It has been by
far the most destructive wildfire this year. A fire in southern New
Mexico burned 28 homes in April, a blaze that marked the early
beginning to the fire season.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday evening, the fire had consumed about 4,400 acres,
destroyed at least 100 structures, including a general store, and was
about 30% contained, said incident commander Kim Martin.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was one of two extreme blazes hounding firefighters in
southern Colorado. Along the New Mexico border south of Trinidad,
Colo., a 19,000-acre fire was burning through mountainous fields that
contained nearly 500 methane gas wells. Several hundred homes along
the Purgatory River were threatened, but none had burned,
firefighters said.</TE>
<TE>   The Iron Mountain blaze fed on timber that was described as drier
than kiln-dried lumber, and it further feasted on a particular kind
of oil-rich oak shrub.</TE>
<TE>   "It took off and screamed through the forest and incinerated
everything in its path," said Ron Gosnell, a fire information
officer. "A fireball blew over a trailer without burning it, but it
was so hot, it melted the vinyl siding. Melted vinyl was hanging in
gobs by the nails.</TE>
<TE>   "Our most experienced firefighters were just shaking their heads,
saying they've never seen a fire like this one, burning so quickly
and so fiercely."</TE>
<TE>   Residents heard similarly grim news when they gathered at the
local high school gymnasium for a Monday evening briefing. The room
stank of smoke and sweat; residents fanned themselves with papers.</TE>
<TE>   A teary-eyed Ilene Dugger, unsure whether her own home was still
standing, stood up at the meeting and said: "I don't have a job right
now, so I've got plenty of time on my hands. If anybody needs any
help, I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   In the school's auditorium, blankets and mountains of clothes were
piling up on the stage, donated by community residents. Outside,
insurance companies already had set up emergency response tables; on
a bulletin board, telephone messages were being left for people who
had lost electricity and phone service. Local ranchers offered to
take care of livestock and household pets. Scores of dogs loped
around the campus.</TE>
<TE>   The American Red Cross was offering medical help and counseling.
Jill Anderson, the local coordinator, understood that for all the
formal assistance that would soon be poring into the town, the Red
Cross had something immediate to offer. "If you want to sit down and
drink a cup of coffee and cry," she said, "we're here for you."</TE>
<TE>   Fremont County Sheriff Ivan Middlemiss said his deputies struggled
to compile a list of destroyed homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, there was more damage than I anticipated," he told
the crowded gymnasium. "The devastation is total. It looks like the
surface of the moon. Everything is ash. There were no street signs,
no identifiers. Basically, all we've got are foundations."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters spent most of Monday attacking the fire from the air,
and they hoped to extend the fire line around it today as more
firefighters arrive. Improved weather, with higher humidity and
possible rain, was forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Officials expect lower winds today. Unpredictable winds hampered
firefighting efforts Monday. "The winds were changing on us all the
time," said Fremont County Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Williams. "They'd go
north, then east, then back north, and we have homes in all
directions."</TE>
<TE>   The homes that burned were widely scattered across private forest
lands in this popular recreation area. Structures that were destroyed
ranged from mobile homes on 2-acre lots to quarter-million-dollar
forest chalets on 35-acre wooded parcels, shrouded by pinyon and
ponderosa pines, juniper trees and gambel oaks, said Williams.</TE>
<TE>   One homeowner acknowledged the challenge of keeping cleared space
between trees and homes--and didn't even try. "I was afraid that the
chainsaw would cause sparks," said Daryl Frost.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday afternoon, the fire had crept to within about 6 miles of
the photogenic Royal Gorge Bridge, which is suspended 1,053 feet
above the Arkansas River and is popular among white-water rafting
enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   To the south, firefighters in Colorado's largest county, Las
Animas, were battling three sets of fires, the most troublesome of
which was crawling through junipers, pinyon pines and brush that
carpeted a sprawling methane gas field.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the wells have caught on fire, none have blown," said
Sheriff Lou Girodo. "These are pretty good people running these gas
wells. They have good safety factors built in."</TE>
<TE>   Girodo said the blaze had destroyed at least one and maybe two
cabins, and that officials would be able to better assess the damage
today. "It's so smoky in there, you just can't see anything," he
said. "The smoke has pretty much put Trinidad out of business."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said about 300 firefighters were expected to be on the
fire lines by today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to get bigger," he said. "It'll lay down tonight when
the temperatures cool, but in the morning, when the temperatures rise
and the humidity drops to single digits, it'll drive that fire right
down the canyons and it'll get larger."</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, more than 1.2 million acres have burned across
the West, well above the 10-year average of 750,000 acres by this
time of year.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters from across the U.S., from New Jersey to California,
are at a heightened level of preparedness because sustained droughts
have dried vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 28 large fires are burning in 12 states.</TE>

<HD>Army Can Keep Hitler Art, Justices Say</HD>
<DH>History: The high court let stand a ruling against Germans
who wanted the paintings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Four watercolor paintings by Adolf Hitler are the property of the
U.S. Army and need not be returned to the Germans who claim them as
stolen artworks, under a ruling that the Supreme Court let stand
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The justices turned down an appeal from the heirs of Hitler's
photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, who contended that the watercolors
were illegally seized at the end of World War II.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, European courts have dealt with claims from heirs
seeking to recover great works of art that were stolen from homes and
museums during the Nazi era.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, the watercolors of street scenes were considered
amateurish and valueless as art. But since they were signed "A.
Hitler," they retained value as historical curiosities.</TE>
<TE>   The German dictator spent his early twenties in Vienna, where he
struggled to establish himself as a painter. He failed miserably and
moved to Munich just before the outbreak of World War I.</TE>
<TE>   His career as a politician was furthered by propagandists,
including Hoffmann, who became the Nazi Party's official
photographer. Hitler was a regular visitor to Hoffmann's home and
studio, where he met his mistress, Eva Braun.</TE>
<TE>   In 1936, Hitler presented Hoffmann with the watercolors as a
birthday gift. Later, during the war, Hoffmann stored his collection
of 2.5 million photographs, as well as the four watercolors, in a
castle in Bavaria.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Army found the collection at the war's end and sent the
photographs to be used in the war crime trials at Nuremberg. The
watercolors were quietly shipped to the United States and kept from
public view at a storage facility in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffmann died in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   His son sought the return of the watercolors and photographs
throughout the 1950s. In 1983, a Texas art collector, Billy F. Price,
filed the first of a series of legal claims on behalf of himself and
Hoffmann's heirs. Price had purchased the rights to some of the
Hitler paintings.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, a U.S. appeals court ruled that the watercolors
were the property of the U.S. Army.</TE>
<TE>   In Hoffmann vs. the U.S., 01-1111, the heirs argued that the
American stance makes a "mockery" of its support for the prosecution
of "wartime thefts of private artworks" in Europe. The justices
dismissed the appeal.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>COLUMBIA, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Missouri officials Monday charged a former nurse at a veterans
hospital with killing 10 patients there in 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Boone County prosecutor Kevin Crane said Richard Williams was
arrested in St. Louis and was being held in the county jail at
Columbia.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 40 suspicious deaths at the hospital in 1992 had been
under investigation for years.</LD>
<TE>   The investigation conducted by agents of the Department of
Veterans Affairs, assisted by the FBI, led to evidence explaining the
cause of 10 deaths, Crane said.</TE>
<TE>   "The cause of the deaths, together with the facts surrounding
them, enabled this prosecution to proceed," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Crane said Williams was charged with 10 counts of first-degree
murder, but he did not comment on what the motive might have been.</TE>
<TE>   The dead were patients at Harry Truman Veterans Hospital in

<KH>DISPATCH FROM VIDALIA, GA.</KH>
<HD>Onion Harvest Is a Real Tear-Jerker</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Georgia's crop of Vidalia Sweets is the worst
in the area's history, with the yield down 60%. Weather, fungus get
the blame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIDALIA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>A confused onion doesn't taste good.</LD>
<LD>   And this growing season, with the crazy weather, Vidalia's
famously sweet onions got mighty confused. First it was boiling hot,
then it froze, then it got boiling hot again.</LD>
<LD>   The onions, distinctive to this slice of southeast Georgia, were
attacked by fungus, felled by sidewall rot, deformed by mutant
bulbs--kind of like Siamese twins--and victimized by all sorts of
other bad things.</LD>
<TE>   As the last of the sweet onions rolled down the sorting line last
week, the disastrous news rolled in: It was the worst season in
Vidalia's history, with a $50-million loss, 60% of the yield
destroyed, dozens of farmers facing bankruptcy and the future of this
signature crop--the sweet taste of the South, the onion that makes
you cry only when it's gone--in serious peril.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never seen nothing like this in all of Georgia," said
Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin. "These boys out in the fields,
they're hurting. A lot may never come back."</TE>
<TE>   People here, in a ring of 20 counties surrounding Vidalia, live
the onion life. Generations of small farmers harvest the onions,
charity organizations rely on them for fund-raisers, a long-standing
socioeconomic hierarchy is built on the work and countless
onion-inspired products have been concocted. There's even onion
fudge. (The onions here may be sweet, but they ain't that sweet.)</TE>
<TE>   The Vidalia Onion Committee, a dues-paying organization of 132
growers, has gone to court several times to protect its native crop.
Judges have ruled that only onions of a specific variety grown in the
20 southeast Georgia counties can carry the name "Vidalia Sweet."</TE>
<TE>   They lack typical onion sass because of the low sulfur content of
the region's soil, which makes the onions less acidic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll eat one straight up, like an apple," said Reid Torrance, a
state agriculture advisor working in Georgia's onionland. "Of course,
it's got to be the right onion."</TE>
<TE>   The ruinous season unpeeled like this:</TE>
<TE>   In November, when 14,458 acres of Vidalia seedlings were planted,
the conditions were perfect: mid-70s, sunny, a touch of rain.</TE>
<TE>   The onions grew very fast.</TE>
<TE>   In December and January--fertilizing time--the good weather
continued.</TE>
<TE>   But then Mother Nature went schizophrenic.</TE>
<TE>   In early February, it got unseasonably warm, with highs in the
80s. The way Torrance tells it, heavy on the personification, "the
onions got confused and thought it was time to come on out."</TE>
<TE>   Just as the bulbs began to mature, a sudden freeze hit on Feb. 28,
killing new growth.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a few weeks later, temperatures climbed into the 90s and
stayed there for a week. "Those li'l guys [the onions] were
sweltering. They couldn't take it," Torrance said.</TE>
<TE>   The extreme fluctuations caused premature rot, leaf damage and
aberrations such as half-formed second bulbs. The weakened onions
fell victim to an outbreak of stemphylium fungus that ate up their
tawny skins and killed their taste.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen a crop go down so fast," said Torrance, who has
been working with onions for 18 years. "You'd see just a little bitty
freckle of rot one day. And then bam! Two days later, that onion
would be applesauce."</TE>
<TE>   Shad Dasher, who surely has one of the best names in the
sweet-onion business, remembers walking onto his farm in April and
feeling his heart sink into the mud. "I went for acres without
finding a single onion I could sell," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His crop was so decimated, he harvested only 450 sacks of onions.
Last year his haul was 21,000.</TE>
<TE>   He has five kids, including an 8-week-old boy, a couple of trucks,
equipment to maintain and a $170,000 farm loan to pay off by the end
of summer. He carries crop insurance, but that won't even cover his
expenses. He's worried now about paying the light bill.</TE>
<TE>   His eyes mist up when he talks about the others.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a woman who worked for my daddy who I used to pick up in
the projects," said Dasher, 36. "Every year she put in weeks for me.
She needs the money. This year I could only hire her for 14 hours.
Know how that feels?"</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day at the G&amp;R Farms warehouse in Glennville, 30 miles
south of Vidalia, one glance at the sorting line showed how bad a
season it was.</TE>
<TE>   With flakes of onion skin floating in the air and the squeak,
rattle and thump of thousands of bulbs getting fed into machines, the
sorters hunched over the conveyor belt, working nonstop.</TE>
<TE>   For every 10 onions that slid past, they plucked out six or seven,
filling waste carts faster than forklifts could empty them. Rotten
onions spilled out, rolling across the concrete floor. Some were
mushy and black, others deformed, others seemingly healthy until
closer inspection revealed nasty brown tissue at their core.</TE>
<TE>   "You should be able to run a sorting line blindfolded," Dasher
said. During a normal year, no more than one out of 10 onions is
culled.</TE>
<TE>   Many Vidalia growers are small farmers, like Dasher, who owns a
66-acre plot. Irvin, the agricultural commissioner, and Georgia's
congressional delegation are pushing for a federal emergency aid
package to keep the farmers afloat. They estimate that at least 60%
of the $80-million crop has been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign varieties, like Chile sweets and Oslo milds, will be
hitting the markets soon. Meanwhile, Vidalia retail prices, usually
between 30 and 99 cents a pound, continue to slip because of low
quality.</TE>
<TE>   In his kitchen, Dasher has more rejected onions than he'll ever be
able to eat. He tries to polish one off every day, one way or the
other. Sometimes he fixes himself an onion-and-tomato sandwich. Other
times he takes a raw onion, cores it, sticks in a cube of beef
bullion and a lump of butter and tosses it in the microwave for 5
minutes. He calls it "onion bullion."</TE>
<TE>   "That's why this whole thing is so sad," he said, looking down at
his hands. "I can't imagine what life would be like if I couldn't
raise onions."</TE>

<HD>Shoe Bomb Suspect Fatalistic, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: Reid, accused of trying to blow up jet, was
resigned to 'death or jail,' prosecutors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Alleged terrorist Richard C. Reid acknowledged after his arrest that
his plan to blow up a transatlantic airliner last December had
failed, and he also said he was resigned to the fact that his mission
would end in "death or jail," federal prosecutors revealed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutors, in describing Reid's alleged confession as
"lengthy and substantial," also noted that the 28-year-old British
vagabond was eager to talk about America's war on terrorism but
repeatedly refused to speak of Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutors made their disclosures in federal court in Boston,
where Reid, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to be tried in
November on charges that include attempted murder and attempted use
of a weapon of mass destruction. If convicted of the most serious
charges, he could be sentenced to life in prison. A copy of the court
filing was released in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Reid's defense lawyers have asked the court to keep his statements
to law enforcement agents out of his trial, contending that his
remarks were not made voluntarily and that Reid had, at one point,
told authorities that he did not wish to speak to them. The filing
came in response to that request.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors insisted Monday that not only was Reid lucid and
cooperative, but he freely spoke to them for hours about the
incident, in which he allegedly tried to detonate a bomb hidden in
his sneakers and kill the 197 passengers and crew members aboard
American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only was Reid willing to talk to agents, by all appearances
he wanted to tell his story," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately" after he was removed from the plane after it was
diverted to Boston on Dec. 22, "Reid inquired repeatedly about
reporters and the media," they noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Moreover, Reid was very forthcoming in his post-arrest interviews
about his reasons for and his purpose in attempting to detonate an
explosive device aboard Flight 63.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Reid considered his 'mission' unsuccessful because the
bomb had not detonated, it is apparent that he wanted America to know
that the war on terrorism had soldiers on the other side willing and
able to attack the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the prosecutors said, Reid realized that the
government's case against him was "overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   "As Reid himself told the investigating agents," the prosecutors
said, "he knew there were only two possible outcomes to his mission:
'death or jail.'</TE>
<TE>   "Thus," they said, " ... there was little to no reason for him not
to speak to investigators."</TE>
<TE>   But at one point he did just that. According to prosecutors, he
twice declined to respond to questions about Bin Laden. The
government has alleged that Reid was trained by Al Qaeda, Bin Laden's
terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge will rule on whether Reid's statements will be
allowed at his trial.</TE>
<TE>   Reid told a Massachusetts state trooper who attempted to speak
with him while driving him to jail that "I have nothing else to say."</TE>
<TE>   That statement is the basis for the defense's argument that
anything Reid might have said afterward should not be allowed in the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said that agents did not consider the statement to
be a blanket refusal to talk.</TE>

<HD>Justices Take Up Police Interrogation Case</HD>
<DH>Law: The Supreme Court will consider whether an Oxnard
officer had the right to pressure a badly injured man for a
statement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE and TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court, taking up an appeal from the Oxnard police, agreed
Monday to decide whether officers are shielded from being sued if
they pressure a badly wounded victim of a police shooting to confess
his wrongdoing in a hospital emergency room.</LD>
<LD>   Oliverio Martinez, a 32-year-old farm worker, was left blind and
paralyzed after a run-in with Oxnard police on a November evening in
1997.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez was riding a bicycle home and took a shortcut across a
vacant lot. Two officers, investigating a tip about drug dealing
nearby, ordered him to stop and dismount, which he did. When an
officer grabbed a knife in his waistband, the two struggled. Martinez
allegedly reached for the officer's gun, and a policewoman shot him
five times, including once in the temple.</LD>
<TE>   Taken to a hospital, Martinez said he was dying. Sgt. Ben Chavez,
suspecting the same, went along in the ambulance in hopes of getting
a tape-recorded statement that would exonerate the officers.</TE>
<TE>   In pain, Martinez repeatedly asked the sergeant to leave, as did
hospital workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I am choking. I am dying," Martinez said in a taped conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, yes. Tell me what happened," Chavez said. "If you are going
to die, tell me what happened."</TE>
<TE>   But Martinez survived, and he sued Oxnard police for violating his
constitutional rights by stopping him illegally, for using excessive
force and for seeking to force a confession from his hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Los Angeles and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals cleared the case to go to trial, but the Supreme Court
intervened Monday, saying it will first hear the city's claim that
Chavez is immune from being sued for his effort to extract a
statement from the wounded man.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling in Chavez vs. Martinez, 01-1444, due next year, will
decide whether the police can use coercive methods to obtain
statements, as long as the person's words are not used against him in
a criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   Alan E. Wisotsky, the city's attorney, argued that the
constitutional ban on coercive questioning by the police applies only
to suspects who are in custody. Moreover, it covers only
incriminating statements that are used in a criminal case, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "First, [Martinez] was not in custody. If he had had a miraculous
recovery, he was free to leave," Wisotsky said in a telephone
interview. "Second, at no time did Martinez ask for an attorney. And
third, Miranda only applies to statements introduced at a criminal
trial."</TE>
<TE>   His appeal to the high court says the civil suit against Chavez
should be thrown out because the city had no criminal case against
Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez "was never charged with any crime," the appeal said. So
the hospital-bed statements were not "sought to be introduced against
him in any criminal proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   Cities routinely defend their police officers in civil suits and
are ultimately responsible for paying damages that might result.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital conversation loomed large in pretrial discussions,
lawyers on both sides said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's lawyers wanted to tell a jury that Martinez admitted he
had grabbed the officer's gun and pointed it at an officer and
therefore was largely responsible for the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Martinez deny he made such an admission. They argue
that it is unconscionable to use comments from a shooting victim who
is in intense pain.</TE>
<TE>   Under Supreme Court precedent, police officers are immune from
being sued unless they violate a constitutional right that is clear
and well-established.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the 9th Circuit rejected Chavez's claim of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Richard Tallman said the sergeant stayed in the emergency
room area for 45 minutes and refused repeated requests to leave. He
also did not give Martinez the so-called Miranda warnings.</TE>
<TE>   "A reasonable officer, questioning a suspect who had been shot
five times by the police and then arrested, who was receiving medical
treatment for excruciating, life-threatening injuries that
sporadically caused him to lose consciousness, would have known that
persistent interrogation of the suspect, despite repeated requests to
stop, violated his [constitutional] right to be free from coercive
interrogation," Tallman wrote for a unanimous court.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney R. Samuel Paz, who is representing Martinez,
had urged the high court to deny the city's appeal so the case could
go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tragic case. [Martinez] is blind and paralyzed. He is
living with his father, but he needs physical therapy and regular
care," Paz said</TE>
<TE>   While sympathizing with Martinez's condition, Wisotsky said the
city and its officers are not responsible. "Sure, it's tragic, but he
made a huge mistake.... When you grab a gun and point it at a police
officer, they have a right to act in self defense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Savage reported from Washington and Wilson from Ventura.</TE>

<HD>Skakel Murder Trial Will Go to Jury Today</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutor says the Kennedy cousin is a 'spoiled
brat' who thinks he'll get away with the crime. The defense calls
state case circumstantial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A prosecutor in closing arguments told the jury Monday that Michael
Skakel was a "spoiled brat" who bragged he could get away with murder
for killing his next-door neighbor, Martha Moxley, with a golf club.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel, 41, is accused of murdering Moxley when they were both 15
years old in October 1975. Skakel is a nephew of Ethel Skakel
Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.</LD>
<LD>   "The defendant for some 27 years has been trying to put spin on
what happened," said States Atty. Jonathan Benedict. During the
summation, a picture of Moxley smiling and one of her badly battered
body were projected on a screen in the courtroom.</LD>
<TE>   "He [Skakel] has spun a web in which he ultimately entrapped
himself," Benedict said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Michael Sherman painted a far different picture.
Sherman told the jury that all the evidence against his client was
circumstantial.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's talk about the forensic evidence," Sherman said, pausing
for a moment. "Well, that's the end of that."</TE>
<TE>   Sherman said prosecutors over the years had strongly suspected
that other people had committed the crime--Skakel's brother Thomas,
and later Kenneth Littleton, whom the Skakel family hired as a
live-in tutor.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyer chided the prosecution for playing
"investigative musical chairs."</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately for Michael Skakel, when the music stopped, he was
put in this chair, the defendant's chair," Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   Jury deliberations are scheduled to begin this morning.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution said Skakel started to make incriminating
statements soon after Moxley's body was discovered beneath a pine
tree on her family's Greenwich, Conn., estate. He allegedly told a
barber that he had "killed before."</TE>
<TE>   Benedict reminded jurors of testimony during the trial that Skakel
had confided to a family limousine driver in the summer of 1977 that
he either had to commit suicide or leave the country because he had
done something terrible.</TE>
<TE>   He cited grand jury testimony in 1998, which was introduced during
the trial, from a former Skakel classmate, Gregory Coleman, that
Skakel had told him in 1978: "I'm going to get away with murder,
because I'm a Kennedy."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman died from an overdose of heroin last year.</TE>
<TE>   In his summation, Skakel's lawyer held up and waved copies of
tabloids sold in supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the state's case," Sherman charged.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't do it. He doesn't know who did it. He wasn't there when
the crime was committed and he didn't confess," Sherman added.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman told the jury that although Skakel had problems as a
teenager, "they never rose to the level ... that he became a demonic
killer on Halloween."</TE>
<TE>   During his summation, Benedict sought to strike at the heart of
Skakel's defense--that he was watching television at his cousin's
house miles away when Moxley was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joseph A. Jachimczyk, a forensic pathologist called as a
defense witness, contended that Moxley died about 10 p.m.--when
Skakel was away. Prosecutors said the precise time of the murder
could not be determined, estimating that it occurred between 9:30
p.m. Oct. 30 and 5 a.m. Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors suggested that Skakel never left his home the night of
the murder and that relatives who said he was at his cousin's house
were providing him with an alibi.</TE>
<TE>   Benedict played a tape in which Skakel told an author that he
panicked the next morning when Dorthy Moxley appeared at his home
looking for her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "How could the sight of Dorthy Moxley create panic in an innocent
person?" Benedict asked the jury. "Only a person seeing that poor
girl under the tree could create panic."</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, the defense contended that Skakel did not know
until morning that Moxley had disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Benedict said the portion of the golf club carrying identification
that the six-iron used in the crime belonged to the Skakel family was
never found.</TE>
<TE>   "The piece that is missing has significance only to someone named
Skakel," the prosecutor charged. "The murderer made sure to hide
forever that part of the club which said where it came from.</TE>
<TE>   "The golf club is not a smoking gun, but it certainly is a warm
barrel," Benedict added.</TE>
<TE>   The death of potential witnesses and faulty memories complicated
Connecticut's case against Skakel.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, Benedict accused members of Skakel's
family of "deliberately suppressing their memories."</TE>
<TE>   "What they truly remember, they simply don't want you to know,"
the prosecutor said. After declaring his innocence, lawyers for
Skakel fought to have him tried in juvenile court. A judge ruled in
January 2001 that Skakel should be tried as an adult. If found
guilty, he could face life in prison.</TE>

<HD>Inmate Whose Lawyer Slept Is Granted Retrial</HD>
<DH>Law: The Supreme Court refuses to hear Texas' appeal that
the attorney's inattention did no harm. The man was convicted of
murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand an appellate ruling that a
Texas death row inmate is entitled to a new trial because his lawyer
slept through substantial portions of his murder trial.</LD>
<LD>   Giving no reason for its refusal to intervene, the high court
rejected an appeal from the Texas attorney general's office, which
contended that inmate Calvin J. Burdine had received a fair trial in
spite of his lawyer's lapses.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court action serves to uphold an August 2001 decision
by a federal appeals court in New Orleans that there had been "a
fundamental unfairness in Burdine's capital murder trial created by
the consistent unconsciousness of his counsel."</LD>
<TE>   The case of Burdine, who has been on death row for nearly 18
years, has been closely watched as a test of just how shoddy a
lawyer's work could be before the Supreme Court found it
unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "An alert, conscious Supreme Court put to rest a case which helped
wake up the nation to the chronic problem of abysmal legal
representation in capital cases," said Robert L. McGlasson, an
Atlanta attorney who has represented Burdine on appeal for more than
a decade. "This is a problem that ... sitting Supreme Court justices
have commented on publicly and have done so implicitly today."</TE>
<TE>   The Texas attorney general's office had no comment Monday and the
district attorney's office in Houston said it plans to retry Burdine
and again seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine's case became a subject of discussion in the 2000
presidential campaign when then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was asked
about the problem of "sleeping lawyers" in Texas death penalty cases
during a debate with his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   The case gained further visibility later that year when a panel of
federal appeals court judges initially ruled that Burdine was not
entitled to a new trial because he had failed to demonstrate that
attorney Joe Frank Cannon's inability to stay awake had harmed his
case. That ruling, which drew widespread criticism, was later
reversed by the full U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, 9-5.</TE>
<TE>   By declining to review the case, Cockrell vs. Burdine, 01-495, the
Supreme Court offered no guidance on the parameters of
constitutionally acceptable legal representation.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, in an 8-1 ruling, the high court reinstated the death
sentence of a double murderer from Tennessee, holding that his lawyer
had done an acceptable job in a difficult case. A year earlier, a
federal appeals court in Cincinnati had overturned Gary Cone's death
sentence, saying his attorney had provided inadequate representation
in part because he failed to give a closing argument in the trial's
penalty phase.</TE>
<TE>   Some capital defense lawyers had expressed concern that the Cone
decision might mean that the Supreme Court would either grant Texas'
appeal or send the Burdine case back to the 5th Circuit for further
review.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the Supreme Court move was greeted with a sigh of
relief by death penalty foes. "The court's refusal to hear this case
is both an acknowledgment and a reminder that the death penalty
system is rife with problems," said Diann Rust-Tierney, director of
the ACLU's capital punishment project.</TE>
<TE>   Other opponents of capital punishment said it was extraordinary
that the issue could even merit serious debate. "The idea that a
sleeping attorney could be 'competent counsel' in a capital case
should have been a punch line, not a headline," said Sue
Gunawardena-Vaughn, who heads Amnesty International's anti-death
penalty unit.</TE>
<TE>   Findings made during a 1995 evidentiary hearing "demonstrate that
Burdine's counsel was repeatedly asleep, and hence unconscious, as
witnesses adverse to Burdine were examined and other evidence against
Burdine was introduced," wrote 5th Circuit Judge Fortunato P.
Benavides in his majority opinion last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Unconscious counsel amounts to no counsel at all," emphasized
Benavides, a Clinton appointee.</TE>
<TE>   Dissenting judges said Burdine was not entitled to a new trial
because trial lawyer Cannon, who has since died, had cross-examined
several witnesses and was not totally absent from the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Rhesa H. Barksdale, a Reagan appointee, said that while the
trial record reflected periods of inactivity, it did not prove that
Cannon was necessarily sleeping. It is possible, he wrote in a
minority opinion, that Cannon merely appeared to be asleep as part of
a "trial strategy."</TE>
<TE>   That contention was "preposterous," said University of Houston law
professor David Dow. "There is not any lawyer who any sane person
would hire who would go to sleep in the middle of a trial as a
tactical move. There are plenty of other ways to express a lack of
concern about the weightiness of the prosecution's case against your
client."</TE>
<TE>   The dissenting judges also contended that not all stages of a
death penalty trial are critical. Barksdale said the majority's
ruling ignored the question of "whether the evidence being presented
while counsel slept was harmful to the defendant's interests, or
whether counsel could have done anything to improve the defendant's
circumstances had he been alert."</TE>
<TE>   As long ago as 1932, in a ruling stemming from the Scottsboro Boys
rape case in Alabama, the Supreme Court said that a defendant in a
capital trial was entitled to "the guiding hand of counsel at every
stage of the proceedings against him."</TE>
<TE>   But a 1984 Supreme Court decision, Strickland vs. Washington, made
it quite difficult for a defendant to prevail on an appeal when he
contends that he received constitutionally deficient representation.
The defendant must demonstrate that his lawyer's performance was well
below professional norms and that the attorney's shoddy performance
prejudiced his client's case.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court issued another decision, U.S. vs. Cronic, the
same day, though, saying that there could be instances where a
lawyer's performance was so deficient that prejudice could be
presumed.</TE>
<TE>   The 5th Circuit ruled last year that the Burdine trial was just
such an instance. The Texas attorney general's office unsuccessfully
challenged the ruling in the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Some prominent death penalty supporters said the Supreme Court
action made sense. "This is one of the very few claims for which
prejudice [against the defendant] could be presumed," said Kent
Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation
in Sacramento. "Texas should have thrown in the towel when they got
the adverse factual finding from a judge years ago that Burdine's
lawyer slept."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's action means that the Harris County district attorney's
office in Houston will either have to retry Burdine, 49, or release
him.</TE>
<TE>   Roe Wilson, an assistant district attorney in Houston, said the
office definitely plans to "retry Burdine for capital murder." She
said it was not clear when the trial would begin.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine was convicted in 1984 of murdering his former roommate,
W.T. Wise, whose body was found in 1983 in the bedroom of a trailer.
Wise had been stabbed twice in the back, and his hands were tied with
cord. Burdine conceded years ago that he and a friend went to rob
Wise, but Burdine denies that he killed him. His co-defendant,
Douglas McCreight, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was paroled
after eight years, even though evidence introduced at trial pointed
to him as the principal perpetrator.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine's appellate lawyer, McGlasson, said he hoped that the
Harris County district attorney's office would reconsider its stated
intention to retry Burdine for capital murder.</TE>
<TE>   "The state of Texas took a gamble years ago in defending the
indefensible, and they lost," McGlasson said. "During the intervening
years occasioned by this gamble, inevitably there has been lost
evidence, missing witnesses and undoubtedly memories will have faded.
A person's life should not be put in jeopardy in this context."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Blamed in Death on Angels Flight</HD>
<DH>Report: Faulty design and maintenance by the city's
redevelopment agency, plus poor state oversight, led to crash last
year, public utilities panel says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Public Utilities Commission is blaming poor design,
construction and maintenance by the city's Community Redevelopment
Agency and its contractors and inadequate oversight by the
commission's own staff for last year's fatal crash of the Angels
Flight cable railway.</LD>
<LD>   Leon Praport, 83, a survivor of the Holocaust, was killed, and his
wife and six other people were injured on Feb. 1, 2001, when one of
the Bunker Hill funicular's two cable cars hurtled down the steep
track and collided with its twin.</LD>
<LD>   The terrifying lunchtime accident sent passengers tumbling wildly
inside the 100-year-old wooden car and propelled one man out the back
door. Crowds of pedestrians at the top and bottom of the hill
watched, horrified, and then rushed to aid the victims.</LD>
<TE>   Before the accident, the system, in operation since it was
restored in 1996, had a flawless safety record. Since then, it has
remained closed.</TE>
<TE>   National Transportation Safety Board investigators have determined
that the cable had unraveled from one of the system's two drums. The
PUC report states that there were "critical errors" in the design of
the drive system, including the use of gear systems that were
"incompatible and subject to failure."</TE>
<TE>   "This report is not yet final," said Terrie Prosper, spokeswoman
for the commission. "We are still developing material facts from our
own investigation and that of the NTSB contractor. We are examining
the roles of all involved parties, including our own staff and the
designers, builders and operators, and working cooperatively with the
NTSB on their investigation."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC report obtained Monday by The Times is being forwarded to
the NTSB for consideration in the final federal report, expected
within a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Times learned a year ago that despite their private engineers'
warnings that track brakes were necessary on the cable cars, CRA
officials allowed the builders to alter the design to eliminate those
brakes and other safety features when the 1901-vintage system was
reinstalled in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC report, scheduled for release within a few days, states
that "although the accident was the direct cause of mechanical
failures, staff has concluded the root cause to be one of human error
relating to the design, construction, maintenance and regulatory
oversight of the Angels Flight railway."</TE>
<TE>   The commission said that analysis of the circumstances before the
accident focused on two areas:</TE>
<TE>   * "Actions of the owner [the CRA] and owner-hired contractors
regarding modifications to the original design and the failure to
incorporate existing industry standards in the modified design."</TE>
<TE>   * The commission staff's shortcomings in "not ensuring that
existing safety standards were applied during the design,
construction, operation and maintenance" of the 298-foot railway.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the Angels Flight accident, the PUC in January
initiated a proceeding to revamp the way the agency certifies the
safety of rail transit carriers such as Angels Flight, and also
changed the management of the rail safety division, Prosper said.</TE>
<TE>   The report identified the principal entities involved in the
reconstruction as the CRA; the Angels Flight Railway Foundation, a
nonprofit fund-raising group; and the Angels Flight Operating Co., a
for-profit operating contractor.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC staff recommended that the commission take the "necessary
legal steps" to ensure that the railway does not resume operations
until the staff certifies the system as safe.</TE>
<TE>   John Welborne, president of the railway foundation, has estimated
that it would cost several hundred thousand dollars to build a safer
drive system and put Angels Flight back in operation.</TE>
<TE>   Barely a city block in length, the funicular railway has turned up
in novels and films. It originally opened on New Year's Eve in 1901.
It was closed in 1969 after passenger traffic had dropped
precipitously.</TE>
<TE>   It reopened in 1996 after a $4.1-million restoration and years of
struggle by preservationists. In October 2000, the so-called world's
shortest railway was added to the National Register of Historic
Places.</TE>
<TE>   The only other fatality to occur on Angels Flight came years
earlier, when a World War II sailor died while trying to walk up the
tracks as a car was traveling down.</TE>

<LD>A federal jury has found that a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy
used excessive force during a confrontation with a detainee at the
North County Correctional Facility in Saugus.</LD>
<LD>   Javier Rocha, 29, charged in his civil damage suit that Deputy
David Sameyah pulled him out of a line of inmates waiting to enter
the jail library March 17, 1999, then took him into a room where he
kicked and beat him. Sameyah testified during the trial that he did
nothing more than administer a routine pat-down search of Rocha.
Three other deputies and a jail assistant supported his account.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors will consider damages next week after returning their
verdict late Friday. Rocha later pleaded guilty to robbery and was
sentenced to three years in prison.</LD>

agencies responsible for enforcing federal immigration law.</LD>
<LD>   Such a policy shift, which is being considered by the U.S.
Department of Justice, would hamper the LAPD's ability to work in

<HD>Police Panel to Study Pursuit Policy</HD>
<DH>Safety: The meeting was called after the death of a
4-year-old bystander in a chase Saturday morning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY and JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission has called a special meeting today
to discuss the department's pursuit policy after a 4-year-old girl
was killed over the weekend in a crash caused by a driver fleeing
officers.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to do everything I can to avoid this again," said Police
Commission President Rick J. Caruso, who was briefed by police on
Saturday's crash. "And if it's between the child and the criminal, I
would rather let the criminal go."</LD>
<LD>   Caruso emphasized that he is not seeking to criticize the
officers. But he wants police to explain the reasoning behind
existing policies and possible alternatives.</LD>
<TE>   He said he wants to review the Police Department's policy on
pursuits to ensure that it is appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure that it's not appropriate, so don't read anything
into that," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "the question that remains in my mind is, what
exactly is the policy dealing with a very crowded situation?"</TE>
<TE>   The chain-reaction accident began about 11:30 a.m. Saturday, when
an auto theft suspect fleeing Los Angeles police ran a red light at
6th and Spring streets. The stolen BMW sedan hit a minivan that
struck a traffic light, which fell on Evelyn Vargas. The girl had
been standing next to her mother on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Darren Rhinehardt of Los Angeles, has been charged
with murder. The 41-year-old was severely injured but is expected to
survive, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The two people inside the minivan, Antonio Aguado, 47, and Ana
Gasca, 41, both of Los Angeles, were seriously injured but are in
stable condition, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses on Saturday criticized police for chasing a suspect
through the area, which was filled with shoppers and merchants. They
said they believed that the suspect was driving as fast as 55mph with
one LAPD cruiser close behind. The speed limit in the area is 25 mph.</TE>
<TE>   According to LAPD policy, the senior officer in the pursuing car
has the responsibility of deciding whether to continue a pursuit. The
officer must weigh the potential threat to bystanders against the
need to make an arrest, taking into account traffic, pedestrians and
how dangerous the suspect is.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan said that according to preliminary
information, the chase was within policy.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's accident comes at a time when the number of pedestrians
injured in pursuits is on the rise in Los Angeles, as is the number
of police pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   There were 769 pursuits last year, up from 597 in 2000, according
to LAPD statistics. Pedestrian injuries nearly doubled from 1998 to
2001.</TE>

<HD>Cooley Denies Coercing Inmate to Lie in 1995</HD>
<DH>Courts: D.A. is seeking dismissal of a civil suit filed by
a lawyer tried in bribery and perjury case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawyer for Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley denied accusations in federal
district court Monday that Los Angeles County's top prosecutor
coerced an inmate during a taped prison interview to give false
testimony in a 1995 bribery and perjury trial against a defense
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   "There is nothing in the tapes to show any coercion," Los Angeles
lawyer Steven D. Blades said in a hearing on a civil suit brought by
the lawyer, Leonard R. Milstein, formerly of Woodland Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Blades said Cooley, who was a deputy district attorney in 1995,
also denies allegations that he maliciously prosecuted Milstein at
the time on charges of bribing the same inmate to lie six years
earlier in a death-penalty murder trial.</LD>
<TE>   Blades was making the argument in support of a motion by Cooley
and Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz to dismiss the suit filed by
Milstein. U.S. District Judge Dean D. Pregerson is expected to issue
a ruling in a week to 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   The suit accuses the two prosecutors of fabricating evidence,
making false statements to the media and filing a false crime report.</TE>
<TE>   Milstein's lawyers, Steve Yagman and Wiley Ramey, argued Monday
that Cooley and Foltz launched the prosecution in retaliation for
Milstein's successful defense of a man accused of a drug-related,
execution-style murder of two men, for which he could have received
the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The jury acquitted Milstein's client of one murder charge and
deadlocked on the second. The defendant received an eight-year
sentence after pleading guilty to a reduced manslaughter charge.</TE>
<TE>   During the murder trial, Milstein directed suspicion away from his
client and toward a key prosecution witness by calling a County Jail
inmate to testify against the prosecution witness.</TE>
<TE>   The inmate, Albert Gutierrez, testified that, while working on the
prosecution witness' car, he found ammunition in the trunk that was
similar to the ammunition used in the killings. Gutierrez also
presented invoices allegedly proving that he had worked on the
witness' car.</TE>
<TE>   After the murder trial, Cooley visited Gutierrez in prison. Cooley
later said the inmate admitted fabricating the invoices and lying
about the ammunition, both at Milstein's request.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said Gutierrez also told him that in exchange for the 1989
testimony, Milstein had agreed to represent him in court on an
unrelated criminal charge.</TE>
<TE>   Milstein was convicted in May 1995 of bribery, perjury and
obstruction of justice and was sentenced to three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   After the conviction, Cooley and Foltz made false statements about
Milstein to the media, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   A state appellate court later threw out Milstein's conviction,
declaring that it was based on insufficient evidence.</TE>
<TE>   In court Monday, Milstein's lawyers argued that Cooley and Foltz
never should have launched the prosecution of Milstein, because an
inmate's word can't be trusted without supporting evidence or
testimony, neither of which they said the prosecution had.</TE>
<TE>   "A lawyer beat two prosecutors, and they got angry and they
decided to jack up the lawyer who beat them," Yagman argued.</TE>
<TE>   "They put up Gutierrez [in Milstein's trial], and they shouldn't
have believed him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's lawyer countered that a witness' credibility is a
determination for the jury to make, not the prosecutor or a judge.</TE>

<HD>Some Principals Ban Dance With Gang Ties</HD>
<DH>Teens: Officials fear that the Crip walk, a popular solo
step, could incite violence.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The C-walk, a tiptoe dance that some people joke looks like skipping
"hopscotch on crack," has caught on among teenagers nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   But the solo performance dance, usually done to fast-tempo hip-hop
and rap music, alarms school administrators. Because of its origins
in a notorious street gang, some in Los Angeles are banning it from
campus parties and proms. The C, after all, stands for Crips, a name
supposedly spelled out in foot motions of some C-walkers.</LD>
<LD>   "The Crip walk is a no-no," Crenshaw High School Principal Isaac
Hammond said. He and other educators complain that the dance
glamorizes gang life and could trigger retaliation from rivals such
as the Bloods, even if most youngsters C-walking are not in the
Crips, or any gang at all.</LD>
<TE>   Hammond outlawed the dance on campus and at this year's prom,
which took place last week. Manual Arts and Washington Preparatory
high schools, also in Los Angeles, forbid the dance, too, and will
issue warnings or even suspensions if it causes fights.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell students you might be somewhere doing that dance and it
could end your life, or get you seriously hurt," Hammond said.
However, he and other principals could not point to any particular
altercation triggered by the dance at their schools, and law
enforcement officials could not recall any serious violence related
to the Crip walk.</TE>
<TE>   Teenagers know the gang started the Crip walk a decade ago, but
say it will cause a fight only if performed in the wrong neighborhood
and while flashing gang hand signs. They dance it for fun and
consider it a badge of honor to master its complicated moves like the
rap stars who popularized it--hopping on tiptoes as if weightless
from foot to foot in a circular pattern with knees bent.</TE>
<TE>   The school administrators are taking it way too seriously, young
people complain.</TE>
<TE>   "The C-walk shouldn't be a problem," said G'Angelo Glover, 17, a
student at Washington Prep who was practicing it on a recent Friday
after school with his dance competition group. "Everybody does it."</TE>
<TE>   Kaylen Pandy, 14, a student at Crozier Middle School in Inglewood,
said most kids "just consider it a regular dance. This is what kids
do to keep out of trouble. We spend all of our time dancing instead
of being out on the streets."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Challenging Moves</TE>
<TE>   Erran Daniels, 16, a student at Manual Arts High in South-Central
Los Angeles said she learned the steps because of the challenge even
though she is aware that it might cause trouble with the wrong
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of footwork," said Erran, who is not in a gang. "But
you have to remember some people will get offended."</TE>
<TE>   The dance is just one teenage fad that school administrators
across the country have forbidden during prom season. Schools in
California, Florida, Ohio, Washington, D.C., and other states have
ruled out grinding, "freakin'" or other sexually explicit dance
moves. Some Los Angeles schools won't allow walking canes, which are
popular tuxedo accessories for boys, because they may be used as
weapons. And most have banned music with obscenities or sexually
explicit words.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Upper Darby High School in Philadelphia and Manual
Arts High won't allow the "Thong Song" or "Back That Thang Up,"
popular hip-hop dance cuts that have some scandalous lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hard to Distinguish</TE>
<TE>   The Crip walk, which is most popular among African American
teenagers, is more difficult to crack down on because it is not
blatantly offensive like sexual dancing, and many adults can't
distinguish it from other hip-hop moves, such as the clown walk, old
man walk, toe walk, Carlton walk, heel to toe, and Harlem shake.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, many adults aren't aware of the dance's history.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is to know, if it's a fad, that it's a Crip dance?" said Anne
Schwab, assistant principal of Carson High School. "It just looks
like kids are skipping.... Teachers were laughing at how, kind of
silly, it looks."</TE>
<TE>   Schwab said the dance has not been banned at her school because
it's just a fad. "There's never been a problem with it. Kids will do
anything to get noticed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to forbid the C-walk is not much different from efforts to
stop Elvis Presley because he wore "lurid" clothes and danced
provocatively, said David Upshal, co-author of the book "The Hip-Hop
Years, a History of Rap."</TE>
<TE>   Like rap music, rock 'n' roll was often blamed for "moral
degradation," Upshal said. Even tame dance moves like Chubby
Checker's twist of the early 1960s offended some grown-ups and were
seen by teenagers as ways to rebel or feel cool.</TE>
<TE>   Upshal said "forbidden" cultures, like those of gangs, are
commonly absorbed into mainstream culture. By that time, they are not
necessarily harmful, he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we all dress and speak has been affected by hip-hop
culture," Upshal said. "And some of those elements stem directly from
gang culture."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some say the Crip walk must be taken seriously, especially
in Los Angeles, because of the dance's gang roots. There are hundreds
of Crips spinoffs and copycat gangs in Los Angeles County and
throughout the world. Law enforcement officials say Crips gang
members are responsible for thousands of deaths and shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Crips culture has become a part of popular movies and music.
Rapper Snoop Dogg, a former member of the Crips, is well known for
throwing up gang signs and C-walking in his videos. The 15-year-old
rapper Lil Bow Wow has also been known to do an offshoot of the Crip
walk during performances, but has denied being involved in any gang.</TE>
<TE>   Gang lore has it that Crips do the C-walk after shooting or
killing someone, said Larry Rael, a detective with the Sacramento
County Sheriff's Department and president of the National Alliance of
Gang Investigators Assns. Rael said he has never heard of anyone
being shot because of the dance, and rumors about such violence may
be exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, parents and teachers should pay attention to the
music young people listen to, and schools should restrict such dances
to prevent the "influences of gangs from coming into their schools."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of kids out there see that kind of stuff in videos, they
see it in school and they see other kids doing it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wes Daily, a detective with the Suffolk County Police Department
on Long Island in New York, and a member of the East Coast Gang
Investigators Assn., said East Coast teenagers C-walk too, but he
emphasized that it is not a major concern. "If everybody was doing it
at a club, I doubt very seriously there would be a drive-by," Daily
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some say it will be difficult to ban C-walking because it has
become so widespread.</TE>
<TE>   Deric Gainer, 21, a student in St. Petersburg, Fla., who C-walks
and does not belong to a gang, said the dance is popular there with
college fraternity guys and elementary school students.</TE>
<TE>   High school students in Seattle say C-walkers are everywhere, but
tend to be cautious when dancing in the Central District, near
downtown, where Bloods hang out.</TE>
<TE>   In Internet chat rooms, teenagers beg for tips on how to perfect
the moves, while others share stories about C-walking at parties and
school dances or during after-school dance-offs called "battles." But
on the Web site www.breakdance.com, one wrote: "Why do you all wanna
do this walk? It's not a dance, it's a gang sign. If you all ain't
reppin' 4 tha blue then watch where you walk." Blue is traditionally
a Crip color.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Prep Principal James Noble, who has studied gang
culture, said he must be stringent because the campus is surrounded
by 17 active gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "Crip walking is not done for fun. It is done to make a
statement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and parents should be alarmed if a student does the Crip
walk because it may be an indication that he or she is at risk of
joining a gang, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Allen, 18, a senior at Washington Prep, said he
understands that the principal wants to "keep students safe" at the
prom. But C-walking is just too cool to stop elsewhere. Check out the
after-prom parties: "There will be a lot of it."</TE>

<HD>Gossip Begins Over Possible Feinstein Bid for President</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Feinstein for president?</LD>
<LD>   A smidgen of speculation was kicked up Monday when California's
senior U.S. senator refused to rule out a potential bid for the White
House in 2004. She didn't rule it in, either.</LD>
<LD>   But in the odd ritual of presidential footsy, no can often be
taken as maybe and maybe can be as good as yes.</LD>
<TE>   At least it's not a no--which was just enough to set the political
gossips to mongering.</TE>
<TE>   The swirl started with Sunday's Parade magazine, which featured
the Democrat and three other turbopowered women on a cover that asked
the question, "Who will become president?"</TE>
<TE>   Also on the cover--circulated to more than 37 million readers
across the country--were fellow U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison
(R-Texas); Condoleezza Rice, the Bush administration's national
security advisor and a talked-about candidate for U.S. Senate
someday; and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the House
Democratic whip.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing a potential presidential run, Dianne Feinstein said,
"I'm not saying 'no'"--a surprising expression of heretofore unstated
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Monday about the equivocal response, a spokesman pointed out
that the Parade interview was done "several months ago."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Feinstein continued to leave the proverbial door open a
crack.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not exploring running for another office at this time,"
Feinstein said in a statement released by her Senate office.</TE>
<TE>   "I am working overtime as a United States senator on issues that
concern me greatly."</TE>
<TE>   She declined to be interviewed and a spokesman, Howard Gantman,
refused to definitively rule out a run.</TE>
<TE>   If she were to seek the Democratic presidential nomination,
Feinstein would start far behind several Democratic rivals who have
already established money-raising committees, given major political
speeches and begun the ritual courtship of voters in the early
balloting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   Her age also could become an issue. "She'd be 71 years old before
Democrats have their next convention," said Charles Cook, publisher
of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report and one of Washington's
leading election handicappers. "She's potentially formidable, but
that's a big problem."</TE>
<TE>   Those close to Feinstein say she has long harbored dreams of being
president--while at the same time abhorring the kind of nonstop
campaigning it would require.</TE>
<TE>   "I never got the impression she'd be willing to go through the
torture of a presidential campaign when she has one of the best jobs
in the world," said a close associate, who requested anonymity while
discussing private discussions held with Feinstein over the years.
"The positives of her current job seem to so outweigh the negatives."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, her associate said, Feinstein recognizes the
added attention--and political clout--that attaches itself to a
prospective presidential candidate (as opposed to a workaday U.S.
senator). "Otherwise, you're just punching a time clock, waiting for
your retirement to vest. She's not like that."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Feinstein came close to joining the Democratic ticket of
presidential nominee Walter Mondale, only to be passed over for
then-N.Y. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro.</TE>
<TE>   After serving two terms as San Francisco mayor, Feinstein lost a
hard-fought contest for California governor in 1990. Two years later,
she was elected to the U.S. Senate. She has been reelected twice; her
current six-year terms ends in January 2007.</TE>
<TE>   A Feinstein presidential run would follow a path pursued by
another of California's senior senators.</TE>
<TE>   The late Alan Cranston waged a 13-month-long campaign for
president in 1984. He was 69 at the time and peaked with a victory
over Mondale in a Wisconsin straw poll.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, Cranston quit the race after finishing fourth
in the Iowa caucuses and seventh in the New Hampshire primary. Two
years later, he struggled to the narrowest reelection victory of his
lengthy California political career.</TE>

<HD>A Dust-Up Over Sand Dune</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Manhattan Beach neighbors call for new limits,
saying park is too popular with outsiders who make noise and leave
trash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 40 years, Sand Dune Park has been a popular, fun-loving
neighbor to residents of Manhattan Beach.</LD>
<LD>   But lately, it has been entertaining hundreds of loud guests at
odd hours and its once amicable neighbors are fuming.</LD>
<LD>   Some, like Milton Rugg, who has lived in the city for 46 years,
have stopped visiting. "We just don't enjoy going there anymore,"
Rugg said. "It used to be our little neighborhood park and now all of
Southern California is using it."</LD>
<TE>   Well, not quite. But it is safe to say that Sand Dune Park, a
three-acre parcel with a children's play area and two handicapped
parking spaces, is no longer solely a Manhattan Beach treasure.</TE>
<TE>   For years, athletic teams and fitness buffs from all over Los
Angeles County have been testing their strength and endurance on the
dune's approximately 100-foot-high slope to the annoyance of
neighbors who complain of trash, noise and parking squabbles with the
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Residents are scheduled to meet with the City Council on June 11
to air their grievances before the council votes on a list of new
park regulations. If the proposed changes are approved, the dune
would be fenced and adult visitors would have to make a reservation.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say that the fence will deter park use after hours, and
the reservation system will allow park monitors to control the number
of people climbing the dune.</TE>
<TE>   Parks officials have recommended that no more than 30 people be on
the dune at one time. On summer weekends, the dune has had more than
300 people a day, officials said. There were 2,550 dune users in
March, a 52% increase from the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Located on Bell Avenue, Sand Dune Park was never meant to be a
regional draw.</TE>
<TE>   For Rugg and the others who built the park around the dune in the
1960s, it was just a little patch of grass and sand to enjoy when the
area was still mostly small beach cottages. The dune is one of the
last remnants of a time when much of the South Bay landscape was sand
dunes, said local historian Jan Dennis.</TE>
<TE>   "The dunes were so high and the sand was so deep you couldn't ride
horseback or bring wagons to get into" Manhattan Beach, Dennis said.</TE>
<TE>   But those dunes have long since been developed and no one seems to
be having any trouble getting to Sand Dune Park.</TE>
<TE>   A city study shows that attendance on the dune had a total
increase of 18% from April 2000 to March 2001. In the next 12 months,
attendance increased 27%.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, we have to draw the line," said Phil Jackson,
spokesman for Residents for Sand Dune Safety, a community group that
supports the proposed changes.</TE>
<TE>   But others in town say that fencing is not the answer. They say
some complaints, while legitimate, tend to get exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of have to adopt a 'live and let live' attitude about
these things," said Larry Teitelbaum, who is leading an effort to
stop the fence proposal. "I live near the beach and sometimes
somebody blocks my driveway, but it's the price I pay to be able to
walk to the beach."</TE>
<TE>   Janice Michaud, a Manhattan Beach resident who opposes fencing,
said she is concerned this will turn into a conflict between
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to work with them to come up with a better solution,"
Michaud said. "Sometimes I think they'll throw up a fence and say:
'Well, that didn't work, we have no choice but to close the park.'"</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the question of whether the fencing and reservation
system are exclusionary tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Some dune users agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "To me parks are supposed to be open places," said Rodney Scates
of Gardena. "I could see if it was a place people came to loiter, but
we're here to exercise, to release stress."</TE>
<TE>   Some dune users said they had never encountered any rudeness or
unpleasant behavior from Manhattan Beach residents. "But you still
can't help but wonder if there's something else going on," said Shawn
Johnson of Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said the new restrictions will probably be tougher
on Manhattan Beach residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy who used to be able to roll out of bed and head to the
dune will have to call and make reservations, while the guy who's
already in his car, traveling an hour and a half will just call"
while he's on his way, said Richard Gill, director of the Manhattan
Beach Parks and Recreation Department.</TE>
<TE>   Dune users said they try to be respectful of the neighborhood and
can understand some gripes.</TE>
<TE>   "I can sympathize with their problems, but it's a public park and
we should be able to use it," said Chris Rivera of Hermosa Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Good luck to the people who have to figure out a way to balance
those two" issues.</TE>

<HD>Out of Control Ojai Blaze Burns 6,000 Acres</HD>
<DH>Fires: Crews also battle flames in San Bernardino, Sequoia
national forests and near Hemet.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stoked by hot, dry weather, fires crackled across Southern California
on Monday, sending firefighters into helicopters and tanker trucks to
battle the blazes.</LD>
<LD>   A wildfire 20 miles north of Ojai more than doubled in size Monday
to 6,000 acres as an expanding crew of firefighters struggled to
contain an inferno fed by churning winds.</LD>
<LD>   "This fire is out of control," Darren Drake, a spokesman for the
U.S. Forest Service, said as he surveyed 20-foot-high flames on a
ridge in the Sespe Wilderness.</LD>
<TE>   Thick brown smoke tinted much of Ojai Valley and ashes reached as
far as Thousand Oaks, coating sidewalks, cars and front lawns.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, one of four wildfires burning across the Southland,
showed no signs of slowing down as officials prepared to bring in
additional firefighters trained to battle large-scale wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   "This fire has the potential to be catastrophic," Drake said. "A
lot of things are really up against us."</TE>
<TE>   Only 10% of the fire had been contained by Monday evening, and
there remained no estimate as to when firefighters will have the
blaze under full control, said Joe Pasinato, a spokesman for the
Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   The cause remained under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Since the blaze began near the Pine Mountain Inn off California 33
about 3 p.m. Saturday, the wildfire has caused the closure of a
stretch of the state highway and several popular campgrounds and
hiking areas, including Rose Valley, Pine Mountain and Wheeler Gorge.
The area's wilderness trails attract about 5,000 visitors a year,
Forest Service officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the San Bernardino National Forest, firefighters
rappelled out of helicopters into a remote area and set up makeshift
camps to fight a fire near Lake Arrowhead.</TE>
<TE>   They battled the blaze until they were too exhausted to continue
and then slept on the ground until they were ready to fight some
more, said Capt. Mark Whaling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called coyote tactics," Whaling said. "It's not like
backpacking."</TE>
<TE>   That fire, believed to have been started by firefighters on a
training exercise, was 80% contained Monday. It burned 2,700 acres,
injured three firefighters and destroyed four buildings and a
bathhouse. It cost nearly $1.8million in firefighting expenses,
Whaling said.</TE>
<TE>   South of that blaze was the Bee fire, which destroyed 432 acres
after starting Sunday afternoon east of Hemet. Firefighters expected
full containment by dark.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sequoia National Forest near Lake Isabella northeast of
Bakersfield, 450 acres burned in a fire that started Sunday evening.</TE>
<TE>   In the Angeles National Forest, 125 acres burned north of Glendora
in Susana Canyon in a blaze that started Monday.</TE>

<HD>ID Thieves Muscle In on Cars at Fitness Clubs</HD>
<DH>Crime: Identity-theft ring allegedly struck at least 300
times in parking lots. Three suspects have been arrested and will be
arraigned today.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An identity-theft ring stalked fitness club parking lots across
Southern California and Las Vegas, stealing credit cards, driver's
licenses, passports and checks from at least 300 vehicles over the
last few months, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives said the suspects stumbled upon a gold mine for
identity theft: fitness clubs where many members leave their wallets
and purses in their cars while going for a quick workout. In one
case, a victim lost $20,000 from credit cards and checking accounts.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's officials said they've never seen a theft ring quite
like it. The suspects allegedly hit fitness clubs as well as schools
and golf courses, burglarizing as many 10 cars at a time. Most of the
crimes occurred in south Orange County. Three suspects have been
arrested.</LD>
<TE>   "They were quick. Reach in, grab and run," said Mark Simon, a
sheriff's investigator. "With digital cameras and computers, you can
make lots of money [from identity thefts]. You can clean them out."</TE>
<TE>   One victim, Kelly Fickinger of Mission Viejo, said she was away
from her car for only 30 minutes when the thieves allegedly struck.</TE>
<TE>   Last month at the Rancho Niguel Tennis Club in Laguna Niguel, she
parked next to the courts, then stuffed her purse, Palm Pilot and
date book underneath the passenger's seat.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned, the passenger windows were smashed. She has
spent the last few weeks trying to straighten out her financial mess,
from stopping direct deposits to ordering credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think [the thieves] would be looking that close inside
my car," the 39-year-old pharmaceutical representative said. "Now I
tell everyone that if their purse is on the floorboard, go get it....
I want others to learn from my mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   The ring worked undetected until March 24, when a deputy noticed a
man and woman in stolen rental cars parked in front of the Lake
Forest Lodge.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy found a cache of driver's licenses and passports in the
back seat of the cars, along with pages of marked maps that
authorities believe showed future targets.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities then uncovered Costco cards, student identifications,
passports from the United States, Mexico and Vietnam, Social Security
cards and even a correctional officer's identification badge,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The ring is suspected of stealing items, then returning to hotel
rooms to print fake checks and identification in the victims' names.</TE>
<TE>   They would use the identifications to rack up hundreds of
thousands of dollars on credit cards and drain bank accounts,
authorities allege.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the suspects allegedly purchased electronics with
the stolen credit cards and returned the items to get cash.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said they found fax machines, laptops, high-quality
printers and software inside the hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "They were pretty organized," said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the
Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested the alleged ringleader, Brian Roy Hahne, 33, after
a brief chase March 25 in Brea. Officials did not release the names
of the other two suspects.</TE>
<TE>   They are being held at the Orange County Jail and will be
arraigned today at North Justice Center in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said others who believe they were victims can call the
Orange County Sheriff's Department at (949) 425-1900.</TE>

<HD>L.A. County Seeks Extradition of Alleged Con Man</HD>
<DH>Justice: Christopher Rocancourt, serving time in Canada, is
accused of defrauding Southland acquaintances in phony investment
schemes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everything about Christopher Reyes seemed to spell fast living and
easy money: He drove a Ferrari, hung out with actor Mickey Rourke and
lived at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Baca, when he was a candidate for sheriff, called him "The
Count" and assured advisors that Reyes would pump Hollywood dollars
into his campaign.</LD>
<LD>   But Christopher Reyes was actually Christopher Rocancourt, a petty
thief turned big-time swindler, a smooth-talking bon vivant with a
hint of street toughness and a dash of danger, former associates say.</LD>
<TE>   One Los Angeles woman who crossed him found a decapitated mouse in
her mailbox. When he fled Los Angeles in 1999 to escape passport
fraud and gun charges, officials say, he had defrauded a dozen or
more people, mostly rich or famous. But he is expected to return
soon, this time in handcuffs, not French cuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is one of three U.S. jurisdictions awaiting his
extradition from Canada, where he is scheduled to be sentenced June
14 for defrauding a businessman of more than $100,000. Los Angeles
County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley wants to be first in line because his
office played the key role in exposing Rocancourt.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a con man, and he found his niche and exploited it to the
fullest," Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the U.S. attorney's office wants him for allegedly
posing as a wealthy entertainment executive and luring an unnamed Los
Angeles businesswoman across state lines to Manhattan so he could
cheat her out of about $100,000. He faces up to 10 years in prison if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Suffolk County, N.Y., want him on charges of
bilking more than $200,000 from residents, false impersonation and
leaving unpaid hotel bills. They say he posed there as Christopher
Rockefeller--despite having a thick French accent.</TE>
<TE>   Although Los Angeles authorities say he may have cheated people
out of more than $1.5 million, many victims "would not come forward,"
said George Mueller, an investigator with the district attorney's
office.</TE>
<TE>   He said Rocancourt chose his victims well. Promising
mouth-watering profits, he allegedly grifted people rich enough to
want to avoid embarrassment or complications. His panache could be
overwhelming, say those who met him.</TE>
<TE>   "He talked a good game," said Peter O'Colmain, general manager of
the Regent Beverly Wilshire, where he skipped out on a $60,000 bill.
"He told us he was the son of [fashion designer] Oscar de la Renta."</TE>
<TE>   Rocancourt, a native of France, is a boyish-looking 34, with dark
hair, soft features and a nonchalant slouch. His wife, Pia Reyes, is
an actress and a 1988 Playboy Playmate of the Month.</TE>
<TE>   Rocancourt declined comment for this story. In previous
interviews, he has shown disdain for those who fell for his charades.</TE>
<TE>   He has described his deals not as thefts but as broken promises to
repay money willingly given.</TE>
<TE>   His confidence and flair gave him credibility and the aura of
success. Workers at upscale restaurants and Rodeo Drive boutiques
were at his beck and call, said one alleged victim.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Beverly Wilshire gave him a whole floor [actually, it was
a three-bedroom suite], he must be very important," said Buddy Ochoa,
a movie stand-in who said he lost $10,000 to Rocancourt in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the hotel must have checked him out. I mean this guy
was dressed in Armani everyday." Ochoa said Rocancourt once took him
to a jewelry store on Rodeo Drive to show him a gold block he claimed
to have bought for $1.5 million. "They closed the store for me,"
Ochoa said.</TE>
<TE>   When Ochoa asked about his business, Rocancourt replied: "I make
money for people."</TE>
<TE>   Born in the village of Honfleur on the Normandy coast, Rocancourt
lived what he has described as a childhood of misery, part of it in
an orphanage with 250 others. His grifter apprenticeship began in
Paris in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   By 1994, he had served four short prison stints in France on
various swindling and counterfeiting charges, according to court
records. He moved to Southern California in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Rocancourt soon began attracting quick-profit dreamers; Ochoa was
the only one willing to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa said Rocancourt told him he wanted to help him with his
financial problems by giving him a chance to invest in a deal in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Rocancourt promised to quadruple Ochoa's investment in a few
weeks. He wanted cash, not a check, and said he needed it quickly. A
bigger catch, prosecutors said, was Shahram Moussazadeh, owner of
several upscale clothing boutiques, including Iceberg on North Rodeo
Drive and Sir Oliver on Beverly Boulevard. Rocancourt boasted he was
part owner of both, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Moussazadeh doled out more than $250,000 in cash, clothing and
cars to Rocancourt in late 1996 and early 1997, Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   He said a search of Rocancourt's Regent Beverly Wilshire suite in
1997 turned up a list of his debts to Moussazadeh.  Among them:
$89,000 for a Ferrari, $20,000 for a Bentley, tens of thousands of
dollars in clothing and more than $100,000 cash.</TE>
<TE>   Moussazadeh did not answer Times requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   In one deal, Rocancourt convinced Moussazadeh that he and singer
Jermaine Jackson, a brother of Michael Jackson, were going to produce
Michael Jackson perfumes, name them after his hits such as "Thriller"
and "Bad" and market them at the clothier's stores, according to
court records.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Jackson could not be reached for comment, but the perfume
deal eventually fell through, Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   Other victims, according to court records and interviews, include:</TE>
<TE>   * French pop singer Michel Polnareff, who lost $250,000 trying to
obtain a gun permit through Rocancourt.</TE>
<TE>   * Businesswoman Amanda Thayer, who rents movie props to studios
and gave Rocancourt, then posing as an entertainment executive,
$100,000 for a $4.2-million business loan he promised her.</TE>
<TE>   She declined to discuss the deal, but sources identified her as
the unnamed victim in the U.S. attorney's case in New York.</TE>
<TE>   * Lillian Pinho of Sunland, who filed a police report about
finding the decapitated mouse in her mailbox and gave him $100,000 to
invest in a business. Rocancourt also once warned that she "better
not snitch on me or you will take a very long nap," Pinho testified
in a Los Angeles Superior Court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   She never got her money back.</TE>
<TE>   The beginning of the end for Rocancourt came in April 1997 when
his beefy Algerian bodyguard, Ali Amghar, went to authorities with a
bizarre story.</TE>
<TE>   He told of Rocancourt paying $2,000 for a fake passport, of his
boasts of sneaking diamonds into the U.S. from Zaire and about a
stash of hand grenades Amghar said he found in a heater at an
apartment Rocancourt rented in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was in big trouble," Amghar said, explaining why he
reported his employer. "So I called him and told him I am gone."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said he never found the hand grenades or enough evidence
of diamond smuggling to seek charges.</TE>
<TE>   But he said Amghar's information played a key role in obtaining a
warrant to search Rocancourt's hotel suite.</TE>
<TE>   That search turned up documents about his many ventures and
evidence of passport fraud, Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1998, the district attorney's office charged Rocancourt
and three others with making and distributing false passports, crimes
that could bring them five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the defendants are cooperating with authorities; the fourth
has fled.</TE>
<TE>   That same month, Rocancourt was arrested by West Hollywood
sheriff's deputies after he admitted to police he had shot a
motorist, inflicting minor wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Rocancourt produced Baca's business card, told deputies he knew
the candidate for sheriff and urged deputies to call him.</TE>
<TE>   They did not. But the next day, Baca phoned the station captain,
Richard Odenthal, inquiring about the arrest. Odenthal, a political
supporter of Baca's opponent, then Sheriff Sherman Block, said Baca
did nothing improper during the call.</TE>
<TE>   Baca has acknowledged an association with Rocancourt, but declined
further comment. Baca's campaign manager, Jorge Flores, said
Rocancourt had told Baca he would raise campaign contributions for
him from Hollywood sources, but never followed through.</TE>
<TE>   Rocancourt fled Los Angeles in July 1999, shortly before his trial
on the passport charges.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife turned up in New York in the summer of 2000, with
Rocancourt using various other names, including Christopher
Rockefeller. Employing methods perfected in Los Angeles, he continued
talking people out of money, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   In Suffolk County, he allegedly posed as a wealthy international
financier in bilking his victims, according to a 12-count grand jury
indictment. He was charged in late 2000 with using a false passport
and of jumping bail and skipping out on $18,000 in hotel tabs.</TE>
<TE>   He and Reyes next showed up in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Rocancourt was using the name Michael or Mikael VanHoven, according
to Canadian court records. His target this time was Robert Baldock,
owner of a corporation in which Rocancourt promised to invest $5
million, court papers said. Baldock agreed to pay Rocancourt's
expenses, pending completion of the deal. In court papers, Baldock
says he spent $120,000 to $170,000 in four months.</TE>
<TE>   In searching VanHoven's apartment, police discovered that he was
really Rocancourt. Authorities checked the Internet and found news
accounts about his Los Angeles and New York forays.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he pleaded guilty to fraud in the Canadian case. His
lawyer, Susan Wishart of Victoria, said prosecutors are expected to
seek a term of two to three years for Rocancourt.</TE>
<TE>   Because Canadian law entitles defendants to credit for double the
amount of time they serve awaiting trial, Wishart said Rocancourt
probably will serve only a few more months. She said he could be
extradited by September.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he persuaded Baldock to give him so much money, she said
he told Baldock he was a race-car driver.</TE>
<TE>   "No one checked him out," she said.</TE>

<LD>   Whether writing nonfiction or fiction, Gould demonstrated keen
insight and adeptness in describing the complexities of women's
attitudes about marriage, adultery, sexuality and divorce.</LD>
<TE>   Because of her presentation of women's views on subjects rarely
examined before in print, Gould was often considered a flag bearer
for the 1970s feminist movement. But she disagreed, once telling the
writers' anthology Contemporary Authors:</TE>
<TE>   "My fiction works represent neither a popularization of feminism
nor a politicization of literature, nor are they intended to achieve
either of these dubious purposes. I have been reviewed by feminist
critics who say my work is anti-feminist and by anti-feminist critics
who say the reverse."</TE>
<TE>   Gould argued less with those who characterized many of her books
as somewhat autobiographical. Certainly that first novel, "Such Good
Friends," which became a 1971 film directed by Otto Preminger and
starring Dyan Cannon, sprang from personal experience.</TE>
<TE>   She was born in Manhattan to fashion designer Jo Copeland and
cigar executive E.J. Regensburg. The Wellesley-educated writer
married novelist and New York Times reporter Philip Benjamin in 1955.
When he died unexpectedly after surgery 11 years later, the young
mother with two sons discovered among his papers a diary written in
code.</TE>
<TE>   Deciphering the code, she found a detailed list of his
extramarital affairs, including the names of many of her good
friends. That background wound its way into Gould's 1970 novel, "Such
Good Friends," which remained on the best-seller list for seven weeks
initially and was so popular that it was reissued in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, the former Lois Regensburg Benjamin married psychiatrist
Robert E. Gould, who adopted her sons. Times book critic Robert
Kirsch saw her 1974 novel, "Final Analysis," as partly
autobiographical, too--with a writer falling in love with her former
psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   Kirsch praised the book, writing that given Gould's perception,
"something very close to romantic credibility is achieved ... not
before some laughter and an occasional misting over the eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Gould's humor was often lauded by critics even when she was
writing about painful subjects such as infidelity or parent-child
relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when I disagree with Lois Gould, I love the way she puts
things," reviewer Jill Robinson wrote for The Times, in describing
"Not Responsible for Personal Articles," the collection of Gould
essays published in 1978. "Lois Gould has a sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   Like Gore Vidal, the reviewer applauded, Gould "moves gracefully
and prolifically from fiction to nonfiction, from serious essay to
lighter satirical pieces. [This book] is a showcase for her style and
her wit ... [including] just simply wonderful, personal, funny riffs
on contemporary life in general. 'City Mouse, Country House' is
especially good, an almost tender commentary on a peculiarly Eastern
custom--this business of having two homes which makes, as Gould
describes perfectly, a vacation just a transfer of household
responsibilities from one territory to another."</TE>
<TE>   Critics credited Gould for avoiding self-pity and bathos in her
most recent work, "Mommy Dressing: A Love Story, After a Fashion,"
the memoir of glamorous socialite fashion designer Copeland published
in 1998. Gould's father left when she was 3, and she and her brother
were reared by a mother more interested in gowning and entertaining
Joan Crawford than in clothing or talking to her children.</TE>
<TE>   "Gould, who could have taken poison pen in hand, is aware of the
flaws beneath her mother's perfect exterior. But she chooses humor,
understanding and pride over bitterness," wrote The Times' Mimi Avins
in reviewing the book. "Clothes, she realizes, were her mother's
shield from unpleasant reality.... As much as she acknowledges her
mother's uncommon ability to create a striking facade, she is equally
adept at illuminating what lies beneath the surface."</TE>
<TE>   Gould's works earned pans as well as praise.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing "Medusa's Gift," Gould's 1991 novel about a faded sexpot
actress (think Marilyn Monroe) and her archive including sperm from
"a president, senator, prince, attorney general, head of M15," Thomas
Mallon sniffed for The Times: "If this really is a novel about the
perilous worship of fame, Lois Gould should count herself among the
victims."</TE>
<TE>   And in reviewing Gould's 1981 novel alluding to Argentina's Eva
Peron, "La Presidenta," the late Ellen Torgerson Shaw wrote
scathingly for The Times: "In a word, we have here a real, genuine
bomba."</TE>
<TE>   Gould, who also wrote allegorical novels such as "A Sea-Change" in
1976 and "X: A Fabulous Child's Story," wrote for the now-defunct
Star-Journal on New York's Long Island and wrote the first and
subsequent "Hers" columns for the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   She was also an editor on several national magazines and served as
executive editor of Ladies Home Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Twice widowed, Gould is survived by one son, Anthony Gould of
Manhattan, and her brother, Anthony Regensburg of Camden, Maine, and
Boca Raton, Fla. Her other son, Roger, died of leukemia one month
before his mother.</TE>

<LD>The state Fair Political Practices Commission confirmed Monday that
no limits on campaign fund-raising will apply to the Nov. 5 secession
election and candidates seeking office in a proposed San Fernando
Valley city.</LD>
<LD>   The commission's ruling would also extend to a secession election
and candidates for a proposed Hollywood city, which, like the Valley,
would be carved from Los Angeles. The Local Agency Formation
Commission is set to decide Wednesday whether to put the Hollywood
plan on the same citywide ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County counsel's office, advising LAFCO, made a
preliminary finding in February that nothing in a voter-approved law
capping financial contributions applies to the campaigns for and
against secession. The office said the 2000 law also would have no
bearing on candidates running for mayor and city council in a
proposed municipality.</LD>
<TE>   The commission backed the county counsel's position Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 34 limits individual contributions to $3,000. It did
not envision secession elections, which follow state procedures but
are considered local contests when it comes to fund-raising rules.</TE>
<TE>   In an advice letter sought by the Los Angeles Ethics Commission,
commission attorneys said the city's limits also would not apply to
the secession campaigns and candidates. The attorneys said the
candidates would be required only to file financial disclosure
statements.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of campaign-finance restrictions said the lack of limits
gives donors a chance to peddle influence in the secession election.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that candidates can receive unlimited amounts from
people who have potential business before the new city," said Bob
Stern, who heads the Center for Governmental Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn has said he intends to raise $5 million to
fight secession. Leaders of the breakaway movements say they hope to
collect $4 million.</TE>

<HD>$3.5 Million Spent to Lobby City Leaders, Panel Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly $3.5 million was spent trying to influence Los Angeles leaders
in the first three months of the year, with the largest expenditures
coming from cellular phone companies and developers, according to the
Los Angeles Ethics Commission</LD>
<LD>   The amount is a slight dip from the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   More than $292,000 was spent on lobbying by cell phone service
providers and related companies. As cell phone use has increased,
providers have built new towers to improve service. The bulk of the
money was spent on lobbying to get permits for those towers,
according to the commission.</LD>
<TE>   Additionally, the Los Angeles City Council is poised to discuss
guidelines for new cell phone towers on public rights of way.</TE>
<TE>   The developers of Ahmanson Ranch and Playa Vista came in second
and third, spending more than $125,000 each to advocate their large
developments during the first quarter of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual Bank and its subsidiary Ahmanson Land Co. have
proposed building 3,050 homes in the Simi Hills north of Calabasas.
Although the land is outside Los Angeles, the project has fueled
concerns about San Fernando Valley traffic effects.</TE>
<TE>   Battles over the Playa Vista development on 1,087 acres at the
foot of the Westchester Bluffs near Marina del Ray have raged for
nearly a quarter of a century.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Bell, which is working with the city Planning Department
to electronically expand the number of telephone lines and expand the
reach of its DSL lines, spent $70,000 on lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   More than $51,000 was spent on lobbyists by the Anschutz
Entertainment Group and its affiliates, which have proposed building
a $450-million downtown football stadium. The group already has an
agreement with the city to create a $1-billion sports and
entertainment district next to Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Ads Seek to Reassure Public</HD>
<DH>Scandal: In three newspapers Thursday, the cardinal will
outline the L.A. archdiocese's policies to prevent sexual abuse by
priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony will be featured this week in full-page ads
in three Los Angeles newspapers, reassuring the public that he is
taking significant steps to prevent future abuse by priests in his
archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   Written as an open letter to residents of Los Angeles and
surrounding communities, Mahony repeats many proposals previously
announced in news conferences and interviews. The cardinal's newly
hired public relations firm, Sitrick and Co., is behind the ad
campaign, believing that the cardinal "had a good story to tell"
readers, said Tod Tamberg, the archdiocese spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The ads will appear Thursday in the Los Angeles Times, Daily News
and La Opinion and will cost less than $50,000, Tamberg said. The
archdiocese, which is seeking a benefactor to pay for the ads, is
attempting to show that "we're doing everything humanly possible to
ensure that these situations do not occur again. Nothing from the
past will be repeated again," Tamberg said.</LD>
<TE>   The ad comes a week before the U.S. Conference of Bishops in
Dallas, which is expected to be dominated by discussions of the
nationwide abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 former and current priests are under investigation by
authorities in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties for
sexually abusing minors.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony last month apologized to priests and parishioners for
reassigning one priest who continued abusing minors for more than a
decade in the 1980s and 1990s after confessing to the cardinal, who
ordered counseling for the man rather than firing him.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, Mahony apologized for transferring a priest
accused of sexual abuse to Cedars Sinai Medical Center, where he
served as chaplain.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Grant, Southern California organizer of Survivors Network of
Those Abused by Priests, denounced Mahony's ad campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "They should be publishing an apology and contact number for the
police," she said. "They should be placing an ad saying they have
covered up clergy abuse for years. It should read: Parents beware."</TE>
<TE>   In the ads scheduled to appear Thursday, Mahony said there will be
no exceptions to his zero-tolerance policy, which requires the firing
of priests who abuse minors. He said he will urge the bishops next
week to adopt a national policy "as comprehensive as the one in place
here: zero tolerance--past, present and future.''</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has called his policy the toughest in the nation, which was
required by the settlement of a lawsuit in December. The victim in
that case, Ryan DiMaria, was awarded $5.2 million from the Los
Angeles and the Orange County archdioceses. The settlement also
called for 11 changes to diocesan policies, including zero tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Mahony said he is creating a Clergy Misconduct
Oversight Board, headed by Richard Byrne, the retired presiding Los
Angeles County Superior Court judge.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Byrne helped arrange for an after-hours hearing when a
lawyer for the archdiocese sought a court order to prevent The Times
from publishing e-mails written by Mahony and other archdiocese
officials. The Times prevailed and published the e-mails, which had
been leaked to KFI radio.</TE>
<TE>   Under Mahony's proposal, the clergy misconduct board will be
expanded to 15 members and be given "broad new powers to review and
strengthen all of our programs to end sexual abuse." Tamberg would
not disclose those powers.</TE>
<TE>   Nanette de Fuentes, a psychologist and founding member of the
board, said she does not expect the group to function dramatically
differently. The board will meet Wednesday to discuss the details of
the proposed changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel positive," Fuentes said. "He wants to look at the
mistakes and move forward."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal also is calling for fingerprinting and criminal
background checks for all priesthood candidates in the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Mahony said that any new allegations of sexual abuse will
be referred immediately to police and the accused priest will be
removed from active ministry until the case is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "Sexual abuse is a grave evil, a sin and a crime," Mahony said. "I
state to you unequivocally that it will not be tolerated.... There
will be no exceptions."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley has threatened to
initiate a grand jury proceeding to recover all archdiocese documents
related to past sex abuse.</TE>

<HD>State Must Reexamine Manson Follower</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Former Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten won a
legal victory when a Superior Court judge ordered the state late
Monday to reconsider her parole denial and take into account her
model behavior during more than 30 years in prison for the LaBianca
murders.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Bob N. Krug of San Bernardino County directed the state
Board of Prison Terms to grant Van Houten, 52, a new hearing during
which, he said, it needed to explore in greater depth her behavior in
prison and provide further guidance on what else she could do to win
her freedom.</LD>
<LD>   As he did in the courtroom last month, Krug lectured the board on
its failure to be more specific about the reasons for denying her
parole after a June 2000 hearing.</LD>
<TE>   He said it wasn't enough merely to claim that she was unsuitable
for release because of the gravity of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state prison system said Monday evening that
the board had already scheduled Van Houten for another parole review
this month.</TE>
<TE>   "She will remain in custody until then," he said. Van Houten is
being housed at the California Institution for Women in Chino.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman said officials had been told about the ruling but
they haven't seen it in writing yet and don't know what specific
instructions the judge has given them.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten's lawyer, Christie Webb, declined to comment, saying
she wanted to discuss the decision with her client first.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten, the youngest member of the Manson family, was
convicted in 1969 of the stabbing murders of Leno and Rosemary
LaBianca in their Los Feliz home. The murders were committed one day
after other Manson followers killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and
four friends who were visiting her at her rented home in Benedict
Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Since her conviction, Van Houten has made 13 appearances at parole
hearings, but each time thas been denied because of the severity of
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   At an hourlong hearing before Krug, her lawyer argued that the
state board failed to consider her exemplary behavior in prison,
where she obtained a bachelor's degree, tutored other inmates, made
quilts for homeless women and served as a leader of anti-drug
program.</TE>

<TE>   "We're going to use every resource we have to find this boy,"
Wemmer said. "Right now we just don't have any answers as to why he's
missing."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father, Franklin Ayala, and his wife, Edwina, dropped
Paolo off at the party about 1 p.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to believe this happened," Franklin Ayala
said. "I feel guilty because I should have stayed with him." The
Ayalas live in West Los Angeles and have two other children--a
13-year-old son and a 10-month-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Two bloodhounds and a helicopter were used overnight to trace the
child's whereabouts. Paolo's scent was followed to Wilshire
Boulevard, about a half-mile from the party on the corner of Wyton
Drive and Beverly Glen Boulevard, said Los Angeles Police Lt.
Michelle Veenstra.</TE>
<TE>   Searchers armed with photos of the boy included PTA members from
El Rodeo Elementary School in the Beverly Hills Unified School
District. They worked from a command post at the home where Franklin
Ayala sat clutching a cell phone, talking to police and sometimes
crying. He sat under a blue tent next to officers who pored over maps
of the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Paolo was described as 4-foot-6 and weighing 50 pounds with brown
eyes and black, curly hair. He was last seen wearing blue and white
swimming trunks, barefoot and shirtless.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Hugh Hefner's employees stopped by the command post with
homemade cookies and bottles of water for police and Ayala. "All of
us [at the mansion] are so concerned," said Mickey Pierson, a butler.</TE>
<TE>   Police found a shoe in Holmby Park, which is next to the house.
But Ayala said it did not belong to his son.</TE>
<TE>   Paolo has never wandered away before and police do not believe
foul play was involved, Veenstra said. There were about 10 adults
supervising the party, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Paolo and about 20 other children played in an
expansive, unfenced yard, which faces Beverly Glen Boulevard, a major
thoroughfare. On Monday deflated balloons were still tied outside the
home.</TE>
<TE>   Students who attended the party were questioned at the school
Monday, Veenstra said.</TE>
<TE>   Police distributed a picture taken of Paolo at the party. It shows
the child playing pinball.</TE>
<TE>   Those with information are asked to call LAPD detectives at (310)
575-8404.</TE>

<HD>Oceanside Buys, Closes Nude Dance Club</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: The downtown of old is slowly disappearing
as the city tries to shed its image as a honky-tonk for off-duty
Marines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OCEANSIDE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Downtown has taken a giant step closer to shedding its notorious
reputation as a honky-tonk for off-duty Marines and sailors.</LD>
<LD>   No more will there be a Playgirl Club, which for four decades
allowed even underage military personnel from nearby Camp Pendleton
to drink soda pop and go bug-eyed looking at buck-naked women.</LD>
<LD>   At a ceremony last week, cheers came from city officials who had
tried for 20 years to convince Playgirl owner Edward "Skip" Arthur to
sell.</LD>
<TE>   Finally they made Arthur an offer he could not refuse: $700,000
for the property and another $700,000 for promising not to open
another nude entertainment establishment elsewhere in town.</TE>
<TE>   At 68, Arthur and his wife, Jeanne--"She's my boss"--say they are
ready to slow down.</TE>
<TE>   Tears, on the other hand, came from two young dancers--stage names
Nadia and Jessie--who watched as Mayor Terry Johnson and City Council
members Jack Feller, Betty Harding and Carol McCauley took turns
being hoisted aloft by a cherry picker to paint over the Playgirl
sign.</TE>
<TE>   "The dancers were like family," said Nadia, 23. "And the young
Marines were always polite. No touching, no nasty stuff. Not like
those businessmen at the club where I worked in Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   "It's all very sad," said Jessie, 18. "The Marines are just boys
and they weren't hurting anybody by coming here to listen to the
jukebox and watch us dance without our clothes on."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but an establishment that advertises "Totally Nude
Dancers" and "Girls Girls Girls" is not what Oceanside wants for its
rapidly upscaling downtown as it attempts to draw tourists and home
buyers with beach-close condominiums that routinely fetch $500,000
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Already the city has had feelers from people interested in opening
a restaurant, retail outlet or comedy club once the site is
renovated.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly the downtown Oceanside of old, which police once branded a
combat zone, is disappearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here in the 1980s and the prostitutes were everywhere,"
Harding said. "We got to know their names. Now they're gone, or at
least invisible. This is not the same city it was."</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the tattoo and massage parlors, sawdust-floor bars and
locker clubs that once dotted the blocks around the Greyhound bus
station.</TE>
<TE>   Even Jughead's, a Marine-friendly bar that a self-described "tough
old broad" named Rosemary "Mom" Hamilton ran with an iron fist, has
been replaced by a trendy restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The late Gustav Hasford, the ex-Marine whose book "The
Short-Timers" became the movie "Full Metal Jacket," also wrote about
his off-duty time at Camp Pendleton in the 1970s in a book titled "A
Gypsy Good Time":</TE>
<TE>   "The civilian slop chute off base was called Oceanside, a pocket
paradise of institutionalized sleaze, fertile soil for bad country
and western bands and cheap-ugly women. Outside the bus station in a
hot night, marijuana dealers and pimps open for business were
strutting up and down the broken white line in the center of the
street."</TE>
<TE>   Signs of change are everywhere on the palm tree-lined streets. A
movie house that once specialized in X-rated features is now being
used by community theater groups, one soon to offer a production of
the Restoration comedy "The Rivals."</TE>
<TE>   Computer stores, pizza parlors, T-shirt shops and curio stores are
sprouting. A surf museum and an art school are popular. There are
still quickie laundries and uniform and equipment stores that cater
mostly to Marines, but the City Council has sought to discourage
further "personal service" businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton has done its part to erase the
Hollywood image of brawling Marines and drunken sailors. More
recreational opportunities are provided on-base and active-duty
personnel are warned that off-duty misbehavior can mean an end to
their careers.</TE>
<TE>   To city officials, the Playgirl Club was a particularly obnoxious
obstacle on the march to redevelopment, not because of what went on
inside--police concede that Arthur actively discouraged drugs and
prostitution--but because of its prime location.</TE>
<TE>   The club, on Pier View Way, is two blocks from City Hall and smack
in the middle of what the city hopes will be a popular promenade from
downtown to the beach and pier.</TE>
<TE>   "The demographics of downtown are changing," said Jane McVey,
director of the city's economic development and redevelopment
department. "The people buying the condos have incomes well above
$100,000. They want to see Trader Joe's or a nice bookstore, not a
Playgirl Club."</TE>
<TE>   There already is a bookstore on the street, right next to the
former Playgirl Club, but it is not the type that McVey and other
officials have in mind: Midnight Adult Book, featuring X-rated fare.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Playgirl's 17 dancers now work at Deja Vu, a San Diego
establishment near the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station.</TE>
<TE>   The departure of the Playgirl Club leaves but one strip joint in
Oceanside. But the Main Attraction, which, unlike Playgirl, sells
alcohol, is several blocks from the heart of downtown and less
visible. City officials have asked the owner about a possible
purchase but have been rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   For a total of $1.5 million, which includes closing costs, the
city took possession of the Playgirl furnishings, mostly chairs and
tables that the city plans to donate to charity. The brass pole that
featured prominently in many of the dancers' routines disappeared at
about the time escrow closed.</TE>
<TE>   The mirrored ball was still above the dance floor when the
politician-painters arrived Friday morning. Later, Mayor Johnson took
the ball to his automobile for possible display at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you get to take that?" Nadia asked. "You're taking our
memories with you."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate response.</TE>

<HD>Daughter Leaves Dear Old Dad High and Dry, but Comfy, in
Back of Pickup</HD>

<LD>Oh Dad, poor Dad: A resident was suspicious of "a man in a baseball
cap" who was "lying in the back of a red pickup truck with a sleeping
bag and pillow for several hours," the Rancho Santa Margarita News
reported.</LD>
<LD>   Officers found the vehicle on a street near Oneill Regional Park
and were told by the owner that his "daughter had left with his car
keys by mistake, and he was waiting for her to return so he could
drive home."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Now for an unsolved mystery: A Laguna Hills man approached another
vehicle parked for several hours on his street, at which point "the
driver slightly rolled down the window and said he was a pet
detective looking for a stolen Dalmatian," the Saddleback Valley News
said. The resident commented "that he has not seen a Dalmatian in the
neighborhood in the past 10 years." I believe I have seen this plot
in a movie, though.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Today's showings (see accompanying) include:</TE>
<TE>   * A house with a discarded ceiling (thanks for the warning!),
submitted by Dick Harmon of San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   * A townhome that Barbara Bava of La Canada jokes would be a
"great gift for the new mom or a great starter home."</TE>
<TE>   * A residence at which guests are apparently expected to water the
lawn (from Kenneth Roos of Culver City).</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, a house with a shower that should attract buyers
unfamiliar with the movie "Psycho" (from Michele Saldonis of Redondo
Beach).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Write on the blackboard 100 times ... : The HOLLYWOOD sign has
been altered numerous times over the years. But Helen Jackson of San
Clemente recalled a time that the name was misspelled in an
educational setting--at the graduation exercises of her son Robert in
1961 (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slow news day in Dana Point, I guess: Resident Hope Luedeke
spotted this bulletin in the police log of the Dana Point News:
"Monarch Beach: Someone reported finding a nude doll."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On second thought: I assume the found item was a toy. Then again,
if it was the sighting of the kind of doll celebrated by Damon
Runyan, that would be a more interesting story.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the road: Bill Howes of Seal Beach was traveling in Ohio when
he saw this item in a Dover newspaper:</TE>
<TE>   "An employee at a West High Avenue gas station reported Sunday
night that a man comes there twice a week wearing a bra and it makes
the employees uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Commented Howes: "Obviously the employees have never been to
California."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   East is East but Western is Western: Art Vinsel of San Pedro
noticed that the Croatian Cultural Center of Greater Los Angeles has
a sign up in the window announcing a new class: "Country and Western
Dance."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: One anonymous reader left a phone message saying he
had never seen cannibalism promoted in a commercial until one
restaurant chain began showing Miss Piggy ordering bacon at
breakfast. I dunno if I'm that offended. Reader sounded like sort of
an Oscar the Grouch type to me.</TE>

<HD>Fiscal Chief Faces Oracle Panel</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Budget director Tim Gage is expected to be asked
today about his role in granting the $95-million no-bid contract to
the company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- The state's budget chief is next up as the
Legislature's hearings on the Oracle contract continue this week in
an attempt to answer questions about the potentially costly deal.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Gage, Gov. Gray Davis' director of finance, will be questioned
today about why the state didn't verify Oracle's claims of big
savings before it signed the $95-million no-bid agreement.</LD>
<LD>   "Tim Gage said, 'Sometimes we don't make the rules' and OKd the
deal," said Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), chairman of the
Joint Legislative Audit Committee. "We're interested in figuring out
that if we don't make the rules, who does?"</LD>
<TE>   The contract was supposed to save California up to $111 million
through volume purchasing and maintenance of database software. But
the state auditor says the deal could end up costing up to $41
million more than if the state had kept its previous software supply
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle, a Redwood Shores-based company, is sharply critical of the
auditor's analysis and defends the contract as a great deal for the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The committee has already taken 67 hours of testimony on the
Oracle deal and other state contracts, and plans up to five more
hearings, two this week and three the next.</TE>
<TE>   Florez told Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) last week
that he plans to wrap up the hearings June 13. But Republicans say
the panel should be ready to hold even more hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it more important to provide taxpayers and all
interested parties [with] an inquiry that is thorough, fair and
objective, rather than one that is incomplete, partisan and biased
due to an unnecessary deadline," six GOP committee members said in a
letter to Florez and Wesson.</TE>
<TE>   Florez said June 13 isn't a firm deadline, but that the committee
needs to finish its work sometime soon to allow Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer to complete his investigation of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure [the Republicans] would like this to go on through next
year, but we are an oversight committee, not the A.G.'s office,"
Florez said.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Lockyer, said that completion of
the committee's work would remove "some impediments" for the attorney
general. "It's inevitable that anytime there are overlapping
investigations occurring that you can run into scheduling conflicts
while you're trying to interview relevant individuals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the committee is scheduled to hear from State
Auditor Elaine Howel and one of her predecessors, Kurt Sjoberg, who
did an analysis for Oracle that supported the company's position.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the battle of the auditors, past and present," Florez said.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle representatives complained angrily before the Sjoberg
appearance was announced that their testimony kept getting put off
and that Florez didn't plan to let them really present their side of
the story.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this [the Howel-Sjoberg confrontation] should have been
the first hearing," said Oracle spokesman Jim Finn. "We hope this
hearing actually occurs."</TE>

<DH>Courts: The campaign reform initiative was approved more
than a year ago. Judge still could consider its constitutionality.</DH>

<LD>A Superior Court judge has ordered Pasadena to sign into law a
controversial campaign reform initiative approved by voters more than
a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The judge left the door open to review the measure's
constitutionality at a later date, however.</LD>
<LD>   At issue was a lawsuit filed in March by Pasadena resident Rene
Amy, who realized that the city clerk had not filed the paperwork to
amend Pasadena's charter to include Measure B, which passed in March
2001.</LD>
<TE>   Pasadena officials said they held off certifying the law in
anticipation of a ruling on the merits of the measure. But Friday,
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge J. Michael Byrne ordered the
city to get the measure on the books.</TE>
<TE>   The measure restricts the gifts, jobs or campaign donations city
officials may receive from anyone to whom they awarded a "public
benefit" within five years of a vote or one year of leaving office.
Its goal is to prevent quid pro quo votes and donations. In Pasadena,
the measure defines public benefits in various ways, but one example
would be a contract worth more than $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica-based Oaks Project, the voter organizing arm of
the Foundation for Taxpayers' Rights, wrote the initiative and
sponsored the drive to get comparable measures on the ballot in four
cities, including Santa Monica, San Francisco and Claremont. So far,
only San Francisco has developed regulations based on it. Officials
in the other cities said the measure is overly restrictive and would
require tremendous resources to enforce. Oaks Project officials deny
those claims.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena case is one of a series of attempts to get judicial
review of the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, in June 2001, Santa Monica tried to get a ruling on
the measure's constitutionality by suing its own city clerk, a legal
tactic to force the issue. A judge dismissed the case in April on
procedural grounds.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Amy asked another court to order Pasadena to
fulfill its duty and sign the measure into law. The Oaks Project
filed a motion in support of Amy. Pasadena then filed a suit of its
own, asking the court to review the initiative's merits and hold Amy
liable for the city's legal expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Amy and his lawyer, Kevin Snider, branded the city's complaint an
intimidation tactic, a device called a SLAPP suit--for "strategic
lawsuit against public participation"--and a violation of a state law
against lawsuits that threaten free speech. When they threatened to
countersue, Pasadena dropped its case against Amy and sued the Oaks
Project.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Byrne partially sided with Pasadena, rejecting the Oak
Project's request that he dismiss the city's suit against it. The
result: Byrne may now rule on the constitutionality of the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully now, even though we still have to file it, we'll have
some direction," said Michelle Beal Bagnerisv, Pasadena's city
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Oaks Project's allegations that Pasadena had filed a
SLAPP suit, the group intends to appeal the judge's ruling and pursue
the matter, said Fredric Woocher, the group's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "The claims arose out of the foundation's exercise of its 1st
Amendment rights," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Oaks Project is not trying to shield the law from review, said
Oaks Project Director Carmen Balber.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to see it in court any longer than we have to," she
said. Any challenge to the law, however, would be legitimate only if
brought by someone "either on City Council or in the community who
feels their rights have been violated," she said.</TE>

<HD>Injured Climber Rescued After Night Spent Dangling From
Yosemite Cliff</HD>
<DH>Emergencies: Copter crew rappels down to pluck Colorado man
and companion from their perch 1,700 feet above the valley floor.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yosemite park rangers staged a daring rescue of an injured rock
climber Monday, plucking him from his perch with the help of a
helicopter after he spent the night clinging to a sheer granite wall.</LD>
<LD>   John Kurth, 33, set out early Sunday for a one-day climb with a
partner up a testy route known as Direct North Buttress on Middle
Cathedral Rock, but was hit in the arm by a falling rock.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Gediman, a spokesman for the national park, said Kurth, an
experienced climber from Durango, Colo., suffered a dislocated arm,
neck injuries and a deep puncture wound, but managed to avoid
plummeting from the vertical granite face.</LD>
<TE>   Unable to advance or retreat, Kurth and his partner, who was not
identified, were forced to spend the night on the wall, braving
temperatures in the high 40s. They dangled at an elevation of 5,700
feet, about 300 feet from the top of the 2,000-foot rock.</TE>
<TE>   The search-and-rescue team was alerted about 7:45 p.m. Sunday,
Gediman said, but couldn't reach the two climbers before darkness
engulfed the valley floor.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday morning, rescuers were flown by helicopter and lowered
by ropes to the top of the buttress, a classic route that sits across
the valley from El Capitan.</TE>
<TE>   The rangers then rappelled down to the climbers.</TE>
<TE>   They stabilized Kurth's wounds, outfitted him in a harness and
hauled him up the face to a place where a line from the Huey Super
205 could be lowered.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Horne, a park ranger and medic, lashed himself to the injured
climber, latched onto the line.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were pulled aloft and ferried down by heli- copter to a
meadow on the valley floor.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics took the climber to the park's clinic for evaluation.
Gediman described Kurth's injuries as serious but not
life-threatening. Kurth was taken to Doctor's Medical Center in
Modesto for further evaluation Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   The venerable, 2,000-foot route up Direct North Buttress is widely
regarded by Yosemite climbers as one of the most scenic ascents in
the valley.</TE>
<TE>   The route typically takes a single day to scale, though climbers
on occasion are forced by weather to spend the night on the cliff
face.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 national parks personnel were involved in the rescue,
Gediman said.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys just had an unfortunate accident," Gediman said.</TE>
<TE>   Noting last week's tragic climbing accident and crash of a rescue
helicopter on Mt. Hood in Oregon, he said, "we couldn't have asked
for it to turn out any better."</TE>

<HD>Guilt Admitted in Blast Killing 2</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ex-Rocketdyne supervisor acknowledges illegally
storing materials at Santa Susana test site. Jury deadlocked on
stiffer charges in earlier trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Rocketdyne supervisor pleaded guilty Monday to illegally
storing explosive materials at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory,
where a 1994 blast killed two employees.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph E. Flanagan's plea to two misdemeanor charges came three
months after a Riverside jury deadlocked on whether he violated
federal environmental laws that carry stiffer prison terms, resulting
in a mistrial.</LD>
<LD>   Flanagan, 61, of Stanwood, Wash., faces up to one year in federal
prison and a $100,000 fine for each misdemeanor count. U.S. District
Judge Robert J. Timlin set Flanagan's sentencing for Oct. 21.</LD>
<TE>   In federal court in Riverside on Monday, Flanagan told Timlin that
Rocketdyne employees violated federal regulations when they stored
explosive materials in a building that "was not kept clean and free
of grit, paper, empty packages and containers."</TE>
<TE>   He also said neither he nor his staff notified Ventura County fire
officials that the explosive materials were being stored at the
2,700-acre facility between Simi Valley and Chatsworth, also a
violation of federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan, who was director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology
Group when the explosion occurred, was tried earlier this year on two
felony counts of illegally burning chemical waste at the field lab on
July 21 and 26, 1994, and one felony count of illegal waste storage.
The jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor of guilt last March.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan's attorney, John D. Vandevelde, said the plea agreement
ends his client's "personal nightmare," which began when two of his
colleagues died in the chemical explosion at the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists Otto K. Heiney, 53, of Canoga Park, and Larry A. Pugh,
51, of Thousand Oaks, were killed when chemicals accidentally ignited
during a series of burns at the outdoor test site.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three surviving scientists at the scene, and Flanagan,
who was not at the scene, were later charged with violating federal
environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan "is legally responsible only because he was the
department head and these regulations impose strict liability on the
entire chain of command," Vandevelde said.</TE>
<TE>   James F. Weber, 52, of Moorpark pleaded guilty last August to one
count of illegally storing explosive materials, a misdemeanor. He is
set to be sentenced next August.</TE>
<TE>   The other defendant, Edgar R. Wilson, 65, of Chatsworth, was tried
with Flanagan earlier this year and is awaiting a retrial.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Rocketdyne's then-parent company, Rockwell International
Corp., pleaded guilty to mishandling chemicals and paid a
$6.5-million fine.</TE>

<HD>Disney to Let Public In on Its Safety Plan</HD>
<DH>Theme parks: In a major policy shift, the company will name
a chief safety officer today and release a manual on training,
emergencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Walt Disney Co., under scrutiny for two high-profile accidents in
a two-year span, will unveil a comprehensive safety plan today that
includes naming a chief safety officer and issuing a 30-page report
on safety.</LD>
<LD>   Officials are expected to reveal once closely guarded details of
their theme parks' safety operations in Anaheim and Orlando, Fla.,
including operator guidelines, accident reporting procedures and how
rides are designed with safety in mind.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear whether Disney will be making any major safety
changes or whether it will be opening up its safety statistics for
public scrutiny.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the changes appear to signal a shift in Disney's corporate
culture. In an effort to preserve what company officials often call
the "Disney magic," they have treated discussions of accidents as
taboo.</TE>
<TE>   When a park visitor died after being struck at the dock of the
ship Columbia in December 1998, park officials cleaned up the scene
and interviewed witnesses before authorities arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "It's monumental on several levels," Tim O'Brien, senior editor of
Amusement Business, a weekly trade publication, said of Disney's
change of heart on discussions about safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an openness from the giant that could send ripples across
the whole industry, as far as safety."</TE>
<TE>   Disney officials declined to comment Monday and would not reveal
details of their plan.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, who saw an advance copy of the report and published an
article in this week's Amusement Business, said it names Greg Hale as
the company's first chief safety officer. Hale previously served as
vice president of design, engineering and regulatory compliance at
Walt Disney World.</TE>
<TE>   The report outlines company policies and procedures related to
safety, training, security and emergency response.</TE>
<TE>   It also will be available on the Internet for park guests and
industry officials who may want to model their guidelines after
Disney's.</TE>
<TE>   The report includes a chapter titled Safety by Design, which
discusses engineering, safety technology, operating guides and
training.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have long contended that Disney needed to be more
forthcoming about their safety policies and more savvy in their
public response to accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The company came under fire after the Christmas Eve accident at
Disneyland in Anaheim in 1998, when a 33-year-old man from Washington
was killed after cleat tore free of the Columbia, flew into a crowd
and struck his head.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland employees cleaned up the scene and cleared away
evidence before police arrived 41/2 hours after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   The park was fined $12,500 for misuse of equipment and failing to
train employees properly.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, Disneyland also was criticized for its public
statements following an accident on Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin that
severely injured Brandon Zucker, who was 4 years old at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials stopped short of blaming Brandon, but implied rider
error by issuing statements that guests are safe when they remain
seated and keep their arms and legs inside the ride.</TE>
<TE>   A state investigation found no evidence that Brandon might have
been misbehaving, and Disney was ordered to make design changes to
the ride's spinning "taxicab"--style cars.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also determined that Brandon was not loaded properly
into the ride and that the lap bar may not have been completely
lowered.</TE>

<LD>Tom Hanks never had it this good when he started acting at Skyline
High School.</LD>
<LD>   Hanks dedicated a renovated theater--complete with high-end
lighting and sound equipment and a new grand piano and stage
floor--in front of 1,000 students, teachers and fellow alumni.</LD>
<LD>   At Hanks' urging, the theater was named after retired drama
teacher Rawley T. Farnsworth, whom Hanks credited as an influence
when accepting the best actor Oscar for "Philadelphia" in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   "Who knows what I would have ended up doing with my time if it
wasn't for Mr. Farnsworth," Hanks said Saturday night. He reportedly
gave at least $100,000 toward the $465,000 project.</TE>

<LD>A former San Joaquin General Hospital obstetrician has filed a
$10-million suit against the county, alleging that it tried to punish
him for seeking to unionize doctors.</LD>
<LD>   In the suit filed last week, Dr. David Gran claims the county
hospital wrongfully accused him of poor patient care and
unprofessional behavior after he started a union campaign and
complained about inadequate staffing.</LD>
<LD>   County hospital officials terminated Gran's contract on May 15
with a severance package of three months' pay. He had worked at the
hospital since 1994.</LD>
<TE>   Gran said he has been a doctor for 20 years, "and nothing like
this ever happened until I said 'union.' I knew this was a witch
hunt. Anyone who speaks up immediately gets disciplined."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to give a reason," County Counsel Robyn Truitt
Drivon said. "[The county] determined that Dr. Gran's services were
no longer necessary."</TE>

should add chemicals such as fluoride to the water supply.</LD>
<LD>   The group will present about 7,000 signatures to the city clerk
today. It is up against another group, the Shasta Oral Health Task
Force, which has lined up $1.1 million in county and foundation money
to fund water fluoridation.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council is waiting for fluoridation studies to be
completed before voting whether to add the chemical. About one-third
of California cities have fluoridated their water supplies, compared

<LD>Santa, the rooftop icon, may be taking a long sleigh ride. Many
offers to house the 22-foot-tall chicken wire-and-plaster St. Nick
that saluted U.S. 101 travelers for half a century have come from
outside Santa Barbara County.</LD>
<LD>   It was removed in March by owners who want to renovate Santa Claus
Lane buildings. If a new home isn't found by January, the five-ton
Santa will be given the heave-ho.</LD>
<LD>   It's attracting interest from a dog kennel in Newhall, a former
pig ranch called the Pork Palace near Buellton and a Lake Arrowhead
mountain church called St. Nicholas' Upper Room. Local homeowners
want to put Santa in their yards.</LD>

<HD>Ex-Secret Service Official to Head Airport Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A former Secret Service official with extensive experience in
Southern California was named federal security director at John Wayne
Airport on Monday by the new Transportation Security Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Ashley G. "Skip" Williams helped draw up and carry out the
security plan for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, said Nico
Melendez, a spokesman for the new agency. As head of the Los Angeles
field office of the Secret Service, Williams supervised more than 150
agents in Southern California and Nevada. He retired from the agency
in 1985 after 20 years of service.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said in a statement that
Williams' experience would be a "great asset" for the airport. "I
look forward to working with him to balance strong security with
common-sense accommodation for the traveling public," Cox said.</LD>
<TE>   Security directors are considered the linchpins of the new federal
presence at 429 airports with scheduled airline service. They are
supposed to function like police chiefs, balancing security
objectives with the concerns of airport users. They will report
directly to the agency's Washington headquarters. Starting salaries
range from $105,000 to $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Williams will be in charge of the federal security screeners who
take over from private employees at John Wayne this year. He will
also supervise special agents responsible for the airport's security
plan, including the safety of baggage, airport employees and
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Secret Service, Williams held senior corporate
security jobs, including stints with Texas Instruments and, most
recently, Gateway. He was director of corporate security for the
computer maker, responsible for planning and operations worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Williams will start in early July.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors to Vote on Paying Family of Man Who Died After
Struggle at O.C. Jail</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors are to vote today on whether to pay a
six-figure settlement to relatives of a man who the family says
suffered fatal head injuries at the hands of sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   Gilbert Garcia died June 1, 1998, two days after he was taken out
of Orange County Jail on a stretcher after a struggle with deputies.
Part of the confrontation was captured on videotape.</LD>
<LD>   A Sheriff's Department official confirmed Monday that a settlement
had been offered but declined to give details.</LD>
<TE>   A source described the county's offer as a "substantial six-figure
settlement."</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove police brought Garcia, 32, to the county jail after
arresting him on an outstanding drunken-driving warrant.</TE>
<TE>   A jail surveillance video shows Garcia interacting with jail staff
with no sign of an injury, shortly before he struggled on the floor
with four deputies, said R. Samuel Paz, the family's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who sustained a fractured skull and brain injury, died at
a hospital two days later.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges,
citing evidence that Garcia could have been injured before he was
brought to the jail.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI opened an investigation of Garcia's death last year.
Federal officials have not yet decided whether to pursue criminal
charges against the deputies involved, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman
for the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Paz said he has spoken to the FBI and has offered to turn over his
case file to assist the investigation.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Is Given More Time on Park Plan</HD>
<DH>Land use: Leader of Orange County supervisors wants a
parkland opportunity at the closed El Toro Marine base to translate
to parity elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad will
give Irvine more time to come up with a way to pay for its promise to
fund north county parks from redevelopment of the former El Toro
Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Coad said last month that, by today, she wanted details from
Irvine of a plan to set aside $800,000 a year from El Toro for 100
years. Without that, she would rescind her April vote allowing Irvine
to begin to annex the 4,700-acre base, where the county once hoped to
have an airport. The Navy, which still owns El Toro, plans to sell
the land to the highest bidder.</LD>
<LD>   After a meeting late Monday, Coad said Irvine officials promised
to have a "skeleton of a structure" in her hands before today's Board
of Supervisors meeting.</LD>
<TE>   Coad said she has been encouraged by some constituents to rescind
her vote and keep the base under county control, which means
redevelopment would be restricted by zoning imposed by the
voter-passed Measure W. If Irvine annexes the property, it does not
have to follow the dictates of Measure W, which rezoned the base from
an airport to parkland and limited types of development.</TE>
<TE>   Park plans for that south county land prompted Coad to press for
parity in the form of parks money for the north county.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big credibility gap, not just between myself and
Irvine, but between them and a lot of cities," Coad said of Irvine's
extensive mailings to voters during the campaign for the March
initiative, promising to build a "Great Park" at El Toro with
museums, botanical gardens, sports fields and a large lake. The city
pledges to honor the spirit of Measure W if it annexes the land.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's April vote to allow annexation removed a critical roadblock
for Irvine, enabling the city to control what is built at El Toro
although it wouldn't own any of the land. A new vote by the Board of
Supervisors could reinstall that roadblock because it must approve
annexations.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent to county officials earlier Monday, Irvine City
Manager Allison Hart said the city's pledge to set aside El Toro
funds for north county parks had been based on its hope that Irvine
would become the owner of the base property and control future leases
and other revenue. But the Navy has since said that it does not
intend to let Irvine acquire the property, a position it reiterated
by letter last week.</TE>
<TE>   Without such control, the city can only offer to share property
taxes when it annexes the land, Hart said. But under a plan announced
in April, Irvine will create a redevelopment agency for the land,
which means the bulk of future taxes on the property would go to the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   A 1993 change in state redevelopment law mandates that the county
would get only 25% of future property taxes--not the 82% that the
city promised to the county in the agreement Coad approved.</TE>

<HD>Veterans Protest Change in Plans for Care Home</HD>
<DH>Saticoy: Several speak out at a meeting of the governor's
commission after project is reduced from 400 beds to 100.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After listening to disgruntled veterans voice their displeasure
Monday with plans to build a smaller nursing home in Saticoy than
proposed, members of a state board toured the 22-acre site.</LD>
<LD>   About 40 local veterans attended a meeting of the Governor's
Commission on California Veterans Homes to complain that the state
reneged on a promise to build a 400-bed home near the Santa Clara
River, reducing it to 100 beds instead.</LD>
<LD>   "I started working on this 10 years ago, and we're still fighting
to make this happen," said LeRoy Andrews, an 81-year-old World War II
veteran from Ventura. "We're still listening to all kinds of excuses
and reasons as to why you changed your mind."</LD>
<TE>   A previous commission comprised of different members had agreed to
build the 400-bed facility on the donated Saticoy property, but the
proposal was revised this year under pressure from the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which will cover more
than half of the $86-million cost of the overall proposal, wanted a
veterans home in Los Angeles with specialized care for those
suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease, said board member
Bruce Thiesen. The largest concentration of California's 2.3 million
veterans reside in or near Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, commissioners developed a plan to build a 500-bed
center on the grounds of the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in West Los Angeles, with 100-bed homes to be built in Saticoy and
Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   The package also includes money to upgrade and renovate the
118-year-old state veterans home in the Northern California town of
Yountville, which was first opened to serve Civil War veterans. It
also contains a provision to seek funding from the federal government
for new homes in Shasta County and Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   But Chuck Bennett of Ojai, chairman of the Tri-County Veterans
Home Coalition, which represents 12 veterans organizations, said he
was not impressed with the new proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're being railroaded a little bit here," Bennett told the
board. "We were told one thing, and now we're starting to get another
story. You made some decisions, and you should stick by them."</TE>
<TE>   The 12-member commission, made up primarily of veterans appointed
by Gov. Gray Davis, met at Ventura City Hall before touring the
Saticoy site, which was donated by Archstone Communities, a developer
based in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The farmland on Telephone Road between Wells and Saticoy roads is
covered with citrus trees, which would be removed to make way for the
nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   An appropriations package sponsored by Assemblyman Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City), which would fund the state's portion of the homes,
was approved by the Assembly last week on a 79-0 vote. It next goes
to the Senate, where it is expected to pass.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes according to plan, the Saticoy home would open in the
summer of 2007, serving 60 live-in residents and 40 day-care
patients.</TE>

<HD>Putting the Rapid Back in Rapid Transit</HD>
<DH>A friendly man on the street is key to keeping MTA's speedy
high-tech buses running on time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe, as Times columnist Steve Lopez suggested in print a few months
back, Derick Mahome really should run the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority. One thing's for sure, he'd be certain to put in a little
extra for the agency's bus riders.</LD>
<LD>   Just look at him now, bolting over a crosswalk on Wilshire
Boulevard in the middle of morning rush hour, legs pounding pavement
in full sprint, sweat pouring down his brow.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey man, stop!" he shouts. "Hey, hey, wait, you've got a rider!
You've got a rider!"</LD>
<TE>   An MTA bus supervisor, Mahome is imploring one of his drivers not
to pull out, so a woman can make her connection.</TE>
<TE>   The bus waits. The woman gets on. Mission accomplished, Mahome
walks back to the corner at Wilshire and Western Avenue, the spot
where every weekday morning he stands watch from 5:45 to 9.</TE>
<TE>   It is from this swatch of sidewalk that Mahome, 38, fills a key
front-line role for the nation's second largest transit agency. He is
responsible for the busiest corner on the busiest route of what is
arguably the MTA's most successful traffic-busting innovation in
recent memory: Metro Rapid, a fleet of more than 100 buses that use
technology to approximate the speeds of a railway.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the MTA acknowledge that high-tech gadgetry can go
only so far.</TE>
<TE>   "Derick Mahome makes this system work," says Rex Gephart, who
oversees the program, more commonly known as Rapid Bus.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of trying to manage the route from headquarters, as is
done with other MTA routes, Rapid Bus puts at least one supervisor on
the streets during each peak hour.</TE>
<TE>   On Wilshire in the morning, it's Mahome. "The eyes and ears of
this thing," says Gephart.</TE>
<TE>   A sturdy, roundish man with buzz-saw energy and a 200-watt smile,
Mahome tries to make sure not only that the morning parade of buses
runs smoothly but that riders get the kind of white-glove treatment
more typically associated with a valet service.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," says Mahome, dressed head-to-toe in the MTA's navy
blue polyester supervisor's suit, "it feels like I'm a glorified
baby-sitter."</TE>
<TE>   One minute he's getting drivers to wait for passengers from the
nearby Red Line subway stop. Then he's jammed partway under a bus,
pants nearly splitting as he peeks through a front wheel well to
check a bad suspension. Then he's peering into a bus engine, fixing a
frozen fuel cylinder by propping open a hatch to let air flow in.</TE>
<TE>   He does all this in the company of riders. Hordes of them,
particularly in the middle of rush hour, when you can often find
Mahome standing in the midst of 60 to 70 people, each waiting for a
Rapid Bus that actually has a seat. They pepper him with questions.</TE>
<TE>   "How do I get to bus No. 2?"</TE>
<TE>   "What's the fare?"</TE>
<TE>   "Where do I connect to go to the Valley?"</TE>
<TE>   Befitting a man who has spent 15 years in the MTA, part of that
time as a driver, Mahome seemingly knows every line and every
connection in the city. "I'll take all the questions from riders as I
can," he says. "But one thing, I don't like people asking questions
for more than 21/2 minutes. If they are there that long, that means
they've been waiting too long ... and the Rapid Bus isn't doing the
job it was meant to when it was drawn up."</TE>
<TE>   The MTA launched Rapid Bus in 2000 with two routes, installing
Mahome as one of a small cadre of street-level supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The system, modeled on one in Brazil and new to this country, has
one line that runs 13 miles down Ventura Boulevard in the San
Fernando Valley. The other line is Mahome's route, slicing 26 miles
down Wilshire Boulevard, from deep in East Los Angeles to Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   The buses, which make fewer stops than most, have several features
that make them faster--including electronic gear that makes traffic
signals hold green lights longer. The MTA has also unleashed its
drivers, letting them roll without a schedule. Rapid Bus drivers are
told to cover their routes as quickly as possible without breaking
the law.</TE>
<TE>   The result? Faster service: Rapid Buses complete their routes up
to 30% faster than normal buses. And more riders: The buses are so
popular--jammed, actually--that overall ridership along Wilshire is
up 40% in two years. And little criticism--a rarity for the MTA,
which usually takes more hits than a crash test dummy.</TE>
<TE>   The street-level supervisors are key to the success of Rapid Bus,
MTA officials say, because they provide a human touch.</TE>
<TE>   Mahome usually positions himself under a Metro Rapid canopy,
intent on keeping the buses from driving in clusters.</TE>
<TE>   "Seems like the guy does whatever it takes to serve us," says Ed
Bishop, a photographer on his way to work in Westwood one recent day.
Bishop recalled the time he left a bag on a bus and reached Mahome
soon afterward. Sure enough, the bag was found.</TE>
<TE>   Mahome is an obviously effective supervisor because he's always
moving, always talking, always fixing. Times columnist Steve Lopez
took note of that in a January article that blasted the MTA for being
out of touch with bus riders.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez spent a morning at Wilshire and Western, to see how crowded
the buses are, and came away impressed with the man supervising the
fleet. "There's a terrific bus-traffic supervisor at Wilshire and
Western who should be running the entire agency," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, that Lopez got me in trouble," says Mahome, laughing. After
the column it seemed like everyone in the agency, and a ton of his
riders, gave Mahome a good ribbing.</TE>
<TE>   Mahome assures the agency's recently hired chief executive, Roger
Snoble, that no, he does not want "the big boss' job." Not a chance.
Too much pressure. Though he wouldn't mind the $295,000-a-year
paycheck or the hefty housing allowance.</TE>
<TE>   "On the serious side, I do really care about this," says Mahome,
wiping his brow as he scans Wilshire.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife says maybe she should buy some red lingerie and put
'Rapid Bus' on it. That way, I'd give her more attention.... I live
for trying to make this thing work."</TE>

<HD>Ryder Injured by TV Camera</HD>
<DH>Court: Actress accused of shoplifting is struck in media
crush. Arm is broken, her lawyer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Winona Ryder suffered a fractured arm Monday when she was
struck by a television camera as she entered a courthouse for a
hearing in her shoplifting case, her lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   The star of "Age of Innocence" and "Reality Bites" was later
treated by a doctor and her arm was placed in a sling.</LD>
<LD>   As Ryder, 30, sat in the Beverly Hills courtroom with ice and a
large bandage on her right elbow, Los Angeles County Superior Court
Judge Elden S. Fox agreed to a break so that the actress could seek
treatment.</LD>
<TE>   From the bench, Fox scolded reporters and photographers, urging
them to be more courteous and ordered them to stay 10 feet from Ryder
as she left the courtroom for the doctor's office. He also said that
one of the Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies escorting Ryder into
the courthouse was knocked in the head by a news camera.</TE>
<TE>   Television video shows Ryder making her way through more than a
dozen cameras when shoving and pushing break out. A sheriff's deputy
appears to bump into a cameraman, who appears to knock into another
deputy, Ryder and her attorney.</TE>
<TE>   That cameraman, Daniel Peek from KNBC Channel 4, said the deputy
pushed him, causing a domino effect.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder was arrested for allegedly shoplifting $4,760 in merchandise
from the Saks Fifth Avenue department store in Beverly Hills on Dec.
12. She has been charged with grand theft, burglary, vandalism and
illegal possession of Oxycodone, a powerful prescription pain
reliever.</TE>
<TE>   She was accused of stealing socks, handbags, a hair band, two hats
and a blouse, and faces up to three years and eight months in state
prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder has maintained her innocence through her attorney, Mark
Geragos, who said his client has receipts for the merchandise and
prescriptions for the medication.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, wearing a cream-colored coat and matching headband, heard
sworn testimony for the first time Monday accusing her of theft.</TE>
<TE>   Security manager Kenneth Evans testified for about 30 minutes,
saying that Ryder passed by three open registers before leaving the
store. Evans detailed her movements throughout the store, describing
how she went to the Gucci, Yves St. Laurent and Donna Karan boutiques
and pulled blouses, bags and hats off racks.</TE>
<TE>   He first noticed her just after 4 p.m. as she was on the first
floor in the accessories section, Evans said. She was wearing a long
cashmere coat and carrying several bags, including a red Saks bag and
a gray garment bag.</TE>
<TE>   Using a diagram of the store, Evans showed how he watched the
actress with surveillance cameras. She took the escalator to the
third floor and back down, gathering items, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said she put on a black hat and wandered throughout the
store without taking it off. She concealed a handbag in one of her
bags, he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder twice entered dressing rooms and spoke to salesclerks
several times, he said. Evans sent another security agent to the
second floor fitting room to watch her more closely.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, whose new movie "Mr. Deeds" is due out this month, recently
hosted "Saturday Night Live," in which she acted in a skit about
shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Before the testimony, Geragos told Fox that he did not believe
prosecutors were treating Ryder fairly.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a disinterested prosecutor," Geragos told the judge. "I
want somebody who doesn't have an ax to grind."</TE>
<TE>   Geragos filed a motion to disqualify the district attorney's
office from the case. Fox did not rule on the motion. The hearing is
set to resume Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Tigers Get Early Jump on Martinez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luis Pujols called it Detroit's best victory this year.</LD>
<LD>   The Tigers tagged Boston ace Pedro Martinez for four runs in the
first inning, then had to rally to beat the Red Sox, 7-6, on Shane
Halter's run-scoring double in the 10th inning Monday night at
Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   "We played hard, we played well and we came back from behind,"
said Pujols, Detroit's manager.</LD>
<TE>   Martinez gave up consecutive homers to begin a game for the first
time in his career, then finished strong for his second consecutive
no-decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw strikes and they hit them out," Martinez said. "There's
nothing I can do about it. I felt pretty good and I was able to
bounce back after the first inning."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox went ahead, 6-4, on Trot Nixon's two-run homer in the
fourth, but Tim Wakefield (2-2) couldn't hold the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Santiago's second homer of the game--and his career--pulled
Detroit within a run in the seventh, and Wendell Magee tied the score
with a two-out single in the eighth against Wakefield.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Higginson led off the 10th inning with a walk and
pinch-runner Damian Jackson went to second on a one-out balk.
Halter's drive off the center-field wall ended the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a good job of coming right back, then Trot hit a big homer
for us," Boston Manager Grady Little said. "That's what we've been
doing all year. We just didn't get a win out of it this time."</TE>
<TE>   Santiago hit his first homer 397 feet over the right-field fence,
then Damion Easley homered to left. Santiago had two homers in 429
at-bats at Class-A Lakeland last season.</TE>
<TE>   "He got some juice out of nowhere," Pujols said.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Tampa Bay 1--Jose Cruz Jr. homered twice at Toronto and
the Blue Jays won their first game under new Manager Carlos Tosca.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays, who swept Detroit over the weekend, fired manager
Buck Martinez before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, who had been in a 10-for-61 slump, had three hits and four
runs batted in. He led off the fourth with a homer against Tanyon
Sturtze (0-7), Toronto's first hit of the game, and hit a three-run
drive in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Walker (1-0), making his second major league start, gave up
one run and five hits in five innings, struck out seven and walked
one.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, New York 3--Mike Bordick hit a run-scoring double in
the ninth at New York and the Orioles defeated closer Mariano Rivera
again.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees had scored two runs in the eighth to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Matthews Jr. singled against Rivera (1-2) with one out in the
ninth and stole second with two out. Bordick followed with a line
drive down the left-field line.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera fell to 1-7 with a 4.47 earned-run average in his career
against the Orioles. No other team has defeated Rivera more than
twice.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Kansas City 0--Jon Garland (6-4) gave up four hits in 6
2/3 innings at Chicago and the White Sox ended a seven-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Magglio Ordonez, Frank Thomas and Paul Konerko each drove in runs.</TE>
<TE>   Garland walked four and struck out five to improve to 2-1 with a
1.25 ERA in his last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 4, Oakland 1--Freddy Garcia (7-4) did not give up a run--a
homer by John Mabry--until the eighth inning at Oakland and won his
third consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   The last five runs Garcia has given up have been homers. Garcia
gave up five hits in 7 2/3 innings and struck out five.</TE>

today, and Troy Glaus will not lead the balloting at third base. He
doesn't play for the Seattle Mariners or New York Yankees, and he's
not an icon the way Cal Ripken or Tony Gwynn are.</LD>
<LD>   But, without hitting one of his trademark home runs, Glaus
displayed ample evidence Monday of why he might become the first
Angel position player since Rod Carew and Reggie Jackson to be
selected--if not elected--to play in three consecutive All-Star
games.</LD>
<LD>   In a thoroughly entertaining evening at Edison Field, the Angels
defeated the Texas Rangers, 5-2. For the Angels, Garret Anderson hit
a home run and Brad Fullmer nearly hit an inside-the-park home run.
For the Rangers, Alex Rodriguez hit a "Did you see that?" home run
into the rockpile in center field, at an estimated distance of 455
feet.</LD>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz and three relievers combined on a five-hitter, with
Ben Weber delivering an inning-ending strikeout with the tying runs
on base in the seventh inning and Al Levine striking out two with the
tying run at the plate in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' contributions with his glove were the most glamorous. He
staged a defensive clinic in the third and fourth innings, showing
the range and strong arm that leads Angel coaches to call him the
best defensive third baseman in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of different ways to win a ballgame," Glaus said.
"Keeping a run from scoring is just as important as driving one in."</TE>
<TE>   He has more errors than all but one third baseman in the league,
but the highlight-reel plays flowed Monday, to the delight and
benefit of Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   On consecutive plays in the third inning, when the Rangers might
otherwise have had two men on and none out, Glaus charged a bunt,
fielded it with his bare hand and made an accurate throw for the out,
then fielded a sharp ground ball down the line, backhanded and threw
out the runner. In the fourth, he charged a check-swing grounder and
threw that runner out too.</TE>
<TE>   "His hands are really good," first baseman Scott Spiezio said.
"He's really good at coming in on balls and barehanding them. He's
got pretty good range for how big he is [6 feet 5] and he's got a
great arm.</TE>
<TE>   "He's what every scout, every manager and every general manager
would want in a third baseman."</TE>
<TE>   On offense, Glaus drew a walk that ignited a two-run rally in the
fourth inning. He leads the league in runs scored and ranks third in
runs batted in, and he leads the Angels in home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that the package Troy brings to the game puts
him in an elite group of not only third basemen, but of all the
players in the league," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of home runs, Ortiz gave one up, as is his habit. He
leads the major leagues in homers given up. This one didn't take
long; Rodriguez was the third batter of the game.</TE>
<TE>   But Ortiz did not give up another hit until the seventh inning,
and the bullpen was happy to take it from there. He gave up two runs
over 6 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning, with Glaus on first base and the Angels up
2-1, Fullmer launched a drive over the head of Texas center fielder
Jason Romano. As he retreated, Romano slipped on the warning track
and fell, allowing Glaus to score.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer kept running and, with right fielder Juan Gonzalez in
pursuit of the ball, the crowd buzzed with the possibility of an
inside-the-park home run. Fullmer wasn't slowing down as he hit third
base, but coach Ron Roenicke held him there rather than risk running
into the third out at home plate. The restraint was rewarded when Tim
Salmon singled home Fullmer, giving the Angels a 4-1 lead.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, the Angels weren't supposed to be able to draft
pitcher Chris Bootcheck. He was expected to be long gone by the time
they could pick him, but the teams ahead of the Angels passed on him
because of concerns about how expensive he might be to sign. The
Angels drafted and signed him, and now he is one of their top
prospects.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are keeping their fingers crossed that a similar
scenario unfolds in today's draft. They're hoping that one of two
high school left-handers projected as top-five picks--Scott Kazmir of
Houston or Adam Loewen of British Columbia--is available when the
Angels pick at No. 12.</LD>
<LD>   If not, the Angels plan to select one of the six players on their
original target list.</LD>
<TE>   Those players are infielder Scott Moore (Cypress High), third
baseman-outfielder Matt Whitney (Palm Beach Gardens High in Florida),
right-hander Zach Greinke (Apopka High in Orlando), Chris Gruler
(Liberty High in Brentwood, Calif., east of San Francisco and
Stockton), left-hander Cole Hamels (Rancho Bernardo High) and
left-hander Joe Saunders (Virginia Tech).</TE>
<TE>   The team has scouted right-hander Kris Harvey, son of former Angel
closer Bryan Harvey. Kris Harvey is expected to be selected in the
first 10 rounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utilityman Shawn Wooten is scheduled for an MRI examination today
to determine whether his right oblique muscle is torn. Wooten injured
the muscle, located below the rib cage, on Friday during his
rehabilitation assignment at triple-A Salt Lake. After an initial
examination there and diagnosis of a muscle strain, the Angels
estimated he would miss three to six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten said he suffered the injury on a swing during his first
at-bat Friday and probably should have left the game. In a later
at-bat, on another swing, he said he "felt a pop."</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, I couldn't do anything," he said. "I couldn't
lay down. I couldn't sit down. It was very uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Even while injured, Wooten is helping Salt Lake win. First baseman
Larry Barnes had hit one home run in six weeks when a box of Wooten's
bats showed up there. Barnes helped himself, and he hit seven home
runs in the next six games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got the good big-league wood now," Barnes told the Salt Lake
Tribune.</TE>

<HD>Martinez Is Fired as Blue Jay Manager</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buck Martinez, hired as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays without any
coaching experience at the minor or major league level, was fired
Monday in his second season.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Jays, off to their worst start in two decades, made third
base coach Carlos Tosca the manager for the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Toronto General Manager J.P. Ricciardi said Martinez, who went to
the Blue Jay bench before last season directly from the broadcast
booth, was fired because of his lack of experience and leadership.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if Buck even knows what his philosophy or style is
because he hasn't had a lot of time to manage," Ricciardi said. "It's
not so much the wins, the losses at this point, it's more the
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   First base coach Garth Iorg also was fired. Bullpen catcher John
Gibbons will replace Iorg and Brian Butterfield, fired May 16 as
manager of New York's triple-A affiliate at Columbus, Ohio, joins the
Blue Jays as third-base coach.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez becomes the fifth manager fired since opening day,
following Phil Garner at Detroit, Buddy Bell at Colorado, Tony Muser
at Kansas City and Davey Lopes at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays, who have the third-worst record in the American
League at 20-33, swept a three-game weekend series with Detroit, but
that didn't stop Ricciardi from replacing Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Only Tampa Bay and Detroit in the AL, and Milwaukee in the NL,
have worse records than the Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez's tenure had been in jeopardy since spring training when
Ricciardi, who replaced the fired Gord Ash in the off-season, issued
a virtual ultimatum for Martinez to produce a hard-working team or
face dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Ricciardi said the team quit halfway through last season and, if
things went as they did last year, a change would be made.</TE>
<TE>   After the Blue Jays dropped to 8-20 at home after an 0-6 stand
last week, Ricciardi said Martinez's status would be monitored series
to series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he was surprised. He understood something was maybe
coming," Ricciardi said.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez had a year remaining on the three-year deal he signed in
November 2000 after leaving the broadcast booth.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, Buck has never managed anywhere outside the big
leagues and it's a tough place to learn," Ricciardi said in spring
training.</TE>
<TE>   Tosca, who was hired by Ricciardi in the off-season, has managed
1,759 games in the minors. He managed Atlanta's triple-A affiliate at
Richmond, Va., in 2001 and spent the three previous years as bench
coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He has been a minor league manager
with the Yankees and the Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco outfielder Barry Bonds was the leader in balloting
for the National League All-Star team with 315,557 votes. Bonds was
batting .340 with 19 home runs before the Giants' game against San
Diego on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   New York catcher Mike Piazza was second with 277,041 votes,
followed by Chicago outfielder Sammy Sosa with 273,421. Sosa hit his
major league-leading 20th homer on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Other leaders included Houston first baseman Jeff Bagwell, New
York second baseman Roberto Alomar, Philadelphia third baseman Scott
Rolen and shortstop Jimmy Rollins, and Montreal outfielder Vladimir
Guerrero.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Star game will be played July 9 at Milwaukee.</TE>

<HD>Triple Mount for Frankel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Medaglia d'Oro will have his third rider in as many Triple Crown
races when Kent Desormeaux gets aboard trainer Bobby Frankel's colt
Saturday in the Belmont Stakes at Elmont, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Laffit Pincay rode Medaglia d'Oro to a fourth-place finish in the
Kentucky Derby, which was considered a good race for the colt in that
a rough start took him out of a plan to contest the early pace.
Instead, Medaglia d'Oro had to come from 10th to reach contention.</LD>
<LD>   When Jerry Bailey, one of the most sought-after riders in the
country, became available, Frankel hired him to ride Medaglia d'Oro
in the Preakness. Sent off as the 3-1 second choice behind Derby
winner War Emblem, Frankel's horse ran the worst race of his
six-start career and finished eighth, beaten by more than 17 lengths.
After the race, Frankel said that Medaglia d'Oro would not run in the
Belmont, but he changed his mind a few days later.</LD>
<TE>   Bailey will ride Essence Of Dubai, the Derby's ninth-place
finisher, in the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel has had considerable success with Desormeaux this year.
They've combined for seven graded stakes wins, among them Milwaukee
Brew's victory in the Santa Anita Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Desormeaux could have ridden Medaglia d'Oro in the San Felipe
Stakes at Santa Anita in March, but he was committed to another
horse, U S S Tinosa, and Pincay took over for a 21/2-length victory.
That's the only win the colt has posted in four starts for Frankel,
who bought him for Edmund Gann after his maiden win at Oaklawn Park
in February. Medaglia d'Oro finished a close second to Buddha in the
Wood Memorial, his last prep before the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel usually has strong ideas about how his horses are to be
ridden.</TE>
<TE>   "Kent's got to let him do his own thing in this race," Frankel
said. "I don't want to see him pushed along through the first part of
the race. I want him to come out of the gate on his own."</TE>
<TE>   Before and after the Preakness, Medaglia d'Oro trained at Belmont
Park, where he worked five furlongs Saturday in 1:002/5.</TE>
<TE>   Desormeaux's mounts have earned $5.2 million, which ranks him
fourth nationally. He has won three Triple Crown races--the 1998
Derby and Preakness with Real Quiet and the 2000 Derby with Fusaichi
Pegasus--but will be seeking his first Belmont victory. Four years
ago, with the Triple Crown on the line, Victory Gallop nosed out Real
Quiet and Desormeaux at the wire.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Baffert, who trained Real Quiet and now has War Emblem, would
have preferred that Desormeaux not have a mount in the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   "Kent's one of those guys that rides more than one horse in a
race," Baffert said. "Corey Nakatani's another one. They're not like
[Gary] Stevens, [Eddie] Delahoussaye, Bailey and some of the others,
who just concentrate on riding their own horse."</TE>
<TE>   Three of the 12 Belmont probables had workouts Monday. Sunday
Break was clocked in 1:02 1/5 for five furlongs at Belmont Park, and
his trainer, Neil Drysdale, caught him in 1:16 for the extra furlong.
Sunday Break galloped out seven furlongs in 1:29.</TE>
<TE>   Also at Belmont, trainer Allen Jerkens, in an unusual move, worked
Puzzlement 1 1/8 miles in 1:55. He worked the first mile in 1:41 4/5.
Most trainers work their horses at much shorter distances, but
Jerkens reasoned that Puzzlement needed nine furlongs to get ready
for Saturday's 12 furlongs, the longest race in the Triple Crown
series.</TE>
<TE>   At Aqueduct, the Belmont longshot Artax Too, who has never run in
a stake, went five furlongs in 1:00 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Break, who has four wins, one second and two thirds in
seven starts, will be making his Triple Crown debut. He was unable to
draw into the oversubscribed Derby field because of the earnings
rule, then Drysdale skipped the Preakness and ran him at Belmont on
May 25 in the Peter Pan. Sunday Break beat Puzzlement by one length
in a mediocre time.</TE>
<TE>   At Churchill Downs, where the weather was hot and muggy over the
weekend, there was slight relief Monday as War Emblem, who's seeking
to become the 12th Triple Crown winner, galloped 1 1/2 miles.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a stronger gallop than he had Sunday," Baffert said. "It
was too hot Sunday. He went slow because of the heat. We've had to
train around the heat."</TE>
<TE>   Dana Barnes, Baffert's No. 1 exercise rider, was to fly from
California to Louisville on Monday night and work War Emblem today.
War Emblem will be flown to New York on Wednesday, on a plane that
will carry other Belmont probables Proud Citizen, Perfect Drift and
Wisemen's Ferry. Entries will be taken and post positions will be
drawn Wednesday.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NIIGATA, Japan</DL>
<LD>He has never taken a team to the World Cup final. He has never taken
a team past the World Cup quarterfinals. In the last World Cup game
he coached, his heavily favored team lost to Denmark, 4-1. In the
only season he coached in Major League Soccer, his team, the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars, finished 7-25, still the league standard
for futility.</LD>
<LD>   Yet during this month-long convention of the world's most renowned
national soccer coaches, no other name is as popular or
influential--or, quite probably, as rich--as that of the smiling
Serbian who has bounced from Mexico to Costa Rica to the United
States to Mexico again to Nigeria to, of all places, the People's
Republic of China, Velibor Milutinovic.</LD>
<LD>   You can call him Bora, as he is known, simply and regally, in
virtually all of the 100 countries he has visited.</LD>
<TE>   (He hasn't coached in all of them. It only seems that way.)</TE>
<TE>   The only exception would be Bora's current place of employment,
China, where there is really no R sound in the language. Milutinovic
is a mouthful in any language, so the Chinese have adapted for their
adopted hero and guru, the first and only man to direct the world's
most populous country to the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Milu is the name they use. Usually with exclamation point and
excitable yelp attached.</TE>
<TE>   It's Milu! on the millions of T-shirts and posters that have been
sold to his rabid followers, Milu! in the bold red type screaming
from the nation's newspapers, Milu! in the streets and in the
restaurants, wherever a Bora sighting is announced.</TE>
<TE>   That never happened when Bora took the United States to the second
round of the 1994 World Cup--although in retrospect, maybe it should
have. Considering the Americans' humiliating 0-3-and-out ride of 1998
and the crew of sad-sack defenders who'll be lining up against
Portugal on Wednesday, Bora's World Cup record as U.S. coach--1-2-1
with a 1-0 loss to eventual champion Brazil--is deserving of its own
wing in the U.S. soccer hall of fame.</TE>
<TE>   In China, where Bora ended a fruitless 44-year World Cup
qualification campaign, just being here is more than enough. On the
day of the country's first World Cup game, against Costa Rica,
Milu-mania has reached such outrageous proportions, some Chinese
officials believe Bora has become too big for his own good and for
the good of the people.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Beijing Times published a series of mock
revolutionary-style illustrations depicting Bora as a 1930s Communist
soldier beneath a blaring red and yellow headline: "China must win."</TE>
<TE>   On television, Bora is ubiquitous, pitching a ridiculous array of
products. His endorsement portfolio includes rice wine (Bora doesn't
drink), language-learning devices (Bora can speak barely a word of
Chinese), DVD players (Bora watches a lot of soccer videos), tennis
shoes (Bora does play a lot of soccer tennis) and air conditioners.</TE>
<TE>   This advertising avalanche doesn't sit well with Chinese soccer
officials, who believe Bora is upstaging the soccer federation's own
endorsements. According to media reports, the central government is
also less than pleased--this, after all, is China's glorious hour,
not Milu's--and the Propaganda Bureau is considering a ban on ads by
Bora after the team's exit in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   China will be leaving after the first round, will it not?</TE>
<TE>   If so, it will be a first for Bora. Mexico in '86, Costa Rica in
'90, the United States in '94, Nigeria in '98--Bora has guided each
of these teams into the second round, a perfect four for four. Making
it five for five with China would be Bora's greatest achievement yet,
considering the squad's lack of star power--only three of China's
players compete professionally in Europe, none at the highest
level--and China is grouped with four-time champion Brazil, Costa
Rica and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Bora has been as cagey as ever, regularly downplaying his team's
chances. But last week, with his defenses perhaps weakened by flu
fever, Bora talked about what it would take to reach the second
round--and how China just might be equipped to get there.</TE>
<TE>   "We need maybe four points to go through," he said. "I don't like
to make calculations."</TE>
<TE>   But he has. Costa Rica, badly weakened by injuries, is suddenly
vulnerable. An opening upset of the Costa Ricans would mean three
points. A tie with Turkey, making its first World Cup appearance
since 1954, is not out of the question. That would be the necessary
fourth point.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Brazil. By all indications, this is not a
Brazilian squad up to usual standards, with an early look of a
quarterfinalist at best. But Brazil against China? Everything about
it suggests a mismatch.</TE>
<TE>   Bora, however, has yet to concede.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is thinking about Brazil without respect," he said. "We
need to respect them but this does not mean we are going to lose."</TE>
<TE>   He has, after all, been there before. Eight years ago, with a
similarly undermanned U.S. squad, Bora found himself matched with
Brazil in the second round. Brazil was loaded with offensive talent,
with Romario and Bebeto at the height of their careers. On the Fourth
of July in Palo Alto, Bora borrowed a tactic from the home team in
the Revolutionary War--backtrack and defend--and held the Brazilians
scoreless until Bebeto's solitary breakthrough in the 74th minute.</TE>
<TE>   That high-water mark in recent American soccer was followed by a
washout four years later for Bora with Nigeria. Easily the most
talented squad he had taken to a World Cup, Nigeria was touted by
many as the first African team capable of reaching the cup final.
Bora considers it the only team he has ever coached capable of
winning the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   But after a fractious buildup, with the Nigerian players chafing
under Bora's conservative defensive system, Nigeria defeated Spain
and Bulgaria, winning its group title and sending expectations
rocketing. But in the second round, against an aging Danish side,
Nigeria's tenuous team chemistry collapsed and Denmark won in a rout,
4-1.</TE>
<TE>   Bora Ball isn't for everyone. It can be methodical and
self-stifling and, to fans of free-flowing soccer, an out and out
bore--which is one reason Mexico fired Bora before the '98 World Cup,
even though his team had qualified with an undefeated record.</TE>
<TE>   It's a style that won't win over many fans accustomed to seeing
their team winning and competing for championships and playing with a
bit of flair here and there. But the tired, the downtrodden, the
underachieving? Give them to Bora and he will get them to the World
Cup. For them, at least on the first go-round, the second round is
Mt. Everest.</TE>
<TE>   As Bora is fond of saying, he travels the world and takes teams to
the World Cup--"That's all I do."</TE>
<TE>   That's all Chinese soccer fans have wanted, for the last 44 years.
For them, for now, that is enough.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't have to take that long, as Bora recently mentioned to
the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "People said, 'We waited 44 years,'" Bora said. "I say, 'Why
didn't you call me before?'"</TE>

<HD>Turkey Sees Red (Twice) in Loss to Brazil</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Brazil, looking nothing like the team that struggled to qualify for
the World Cup, came from behind to defeat Turkey, 2-1, Monday in a
vastly entertaining game played in front of 33,842 fans in Ulsan,
South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The only blemishes on the match were the two red cards issued to
Turkish players late in the game as frustrations boiled over and the
feigning of an injury by Rivaldo that led to one of the expulsions.</LD>
<LD>   The Brazilians, shrugging of the loss of defender Emerson,
attacked from the outset and were only denied the lead by the fine
goalkeeping of Turkey's Rustu Recber.</LD>
<TE>   The Turks took the lead against the run of play in injury time at
the end of the first half when Yildiray Basturk sent a diagonal pass
through the Brazilian defense for Hasan Sas to run onto and fire a
splendid first-time volley past goalkeeper Marcos.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil responded five minutes into the second half when Rivaldo's
cross from the left was met in the air by Ronaldo, who raced between
two defenders and was almost parallel to the ground when he beat
Recber from close range.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil clinched the match in controversial fashion in the 86th
minute when Rivaldo scored from the penalty spot after Turkish
defender Alpay Ozalan pulled down Luizao.</TE>
<TE>   Korean referee Kim Young-Joo red-carded Ozalan and awarded the
penalty kick although television replays showed the shirt-tugging
foul occurred outside the penalty area.</TE>
<TE>   Kim also ejected Hakan Unsal in the last minute for kicking the
ball at Rivaldo in a fit of anger. Although the ball only hit him on
the knee, Rivaldo fell to the ground clutching his face. He later
admitted faking the injury.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I exaggerated the incident for the guy to be sent
off," he said. "The ball hit my hand and my leg. It didn't hit me in
the face, but that kind of attitude must not be allowed on the pitch.
He deserved to have a red card."</TE>
<TE>   Early today, however, FIFA announced that it is investigating and
that Rivaldo could be suspended. Spokesman Keith Cooper told a news
conference the organization's disciplinary committee would study the
incident closely.</TE>
<TE>   "We have gone into this World Cup making clear there would be a
clamp down on simulation--that's FIFA-speak for cheating. And if the
disciplinary authorities think there is sufficient cause to take a
second look at a particular incident they may do so."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil plays China on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey Coach Senol Gunes was displeased with the way the game
turned out for his team, which was playing its first World Cup match
in 48 years.</TE>
<TE>   "There was tremendous injustice in this result," he said. "It was
a great effort by us and we didn't get what we deserved, and that was
a point."</TE>

<HD>Tyson Is Proving What Many Suspected</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Whitlock of the Kansas City Star, commenting on Mike Tyson's
fight with Lennox Lewis in Memphis on Saturday:</LD>
<LD>   "I'm still not convinced the fight will take place.... Right now
you can't give away tickets to Tyson-Lewis, a bout that has been
hyped nonstop for a year.</LD>
<LD>   "All of Tyson's crazy, pre-fight hype may have actually hurt the
gate. Instead of piquing interest in the fight, Tyson has confirmed
that he's one of the most unstable people on the planet."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the single-game record for assists in the
NBA Finals?</TE>
<TE>   Envy factor? Red Auerbach, the former Boston Celtic coach,
continues to needle Laker Coach Phil Jackson, noting that Jackson has
won big after inheriting Michael Jordan in Chicago and Shaquille
O'Neal in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of your great coaches do some teaching and developing of
players," Auerbach said. "Phil may be able to do it, but he hasn't
shown it. His teams have been ready-made."</TE>
<TE>   About as "ready-made" as Auerbach's teams were with Bill Russell.</TE>
<TE>   Bullpen: Pitcher Dan Plesac, who was traded by the Blue Jays to
the Phillies recently, jokingly said he wouldn't miss Scott Eyre, his
chatty colleague in the Toronto bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "Scotty was talking my ear off and about the fourth inning of a
game recently," Plesac said, "so I picked up the phone and called the
manager and said, ' ... you either have to put me in now or put him
in now because I can't stand it anymore.'"</TE>
<TE>   Classic series: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News, on the
Lakers' overtime victory over Sacramento on Sunday: "The Lakers are
viewed as villains in many corners--possibly most corners--of the
NBA-watching world, because they seem more like cartoon characters
and sparkling commercial pitchmen than real players.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, this series--this amazing, historic, stomach-churning
(literally) series--was about real basketball. Real nerves. Real
sweat. Real brilliance. A real Laker comeback from trailing three
games to two."</TE>
<TE>   That's no Bullwinkle: Players and fans in Denver were entertained
Monday night when a squirrel roamed the outfield during the Dodgers'
game with the Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   The squirrel entered the field from near the Rocky dugout to the
cheers of the fans in the top of the third inning. Two small birds
repeatedly swooped down and pecked at it. The grounds crew finally
got the squirrel off the field during a rain delay with one out in
the bottom half of the third.</TE>
<TE>   His hang-up: While chatting with Bob Costas on his HBO show, "On
the Record," Miami Heat Coach Pat Riley admitted that he's not
entirely normal.</TE>
<TE>   "I want control," Riley said. "I'm a control freak. It costs me
about $160 every now and then to deal with that aspect of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Magic Johnson, 21, against Boston on June 3, 1984.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The Seattle Seahawks' new logo and uniforms are a new
shade of blue called "Seahawks Blue."</TE>
<TE>   It's not royal, it's not navy, and it's not midnight. It's closer
to silver, but it's not quite that either, although it has a hint of
shimmer.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Darrell Jackson certainly is no help.</TE>
<TE>   "What color is this?" he asked, pointing at his helmet.</TE>

<HD>Change of Venue Chance Damaged</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Vote urges more discussion of proposal to
move 17-day meet from Pomona Fairplex to Santa Anita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those hoping to keep horse racing at Fairplex Park in Pomona for a
64th season gained a powerful ally Monday when the Thoroughbred
Owners of California voted to urge more extensive discussion of the
meet's future.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-member California Horse Racing Board is expected to vote
Thursday on whether to approve the request of James Henwood, Los
Angeles County Fair president-chief executive, to change the venue of
his 17-day meet from Fairplex to Santa Anita Park in Arcadia.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the lateness of the day, the need for more information, the
potential negative impacts on other tracks, the legal impediments
posed, and the break from a long tradition of racing at
Fairplex--[these] all justify a very close and careful look," John
Van de Kamp, president of the thoroughbred owners said.</LD>
<TE>   That was warmly received by Sherwood Chillingworth, the Oak Tree
Racing Assn. executive vice president whose meet at Santa Anita
immediately follows the Sept. 13-29 fair dates.</TE>
<TE>   "The [horse racing] board has to make up its own mind--they know
what's best for the horse racing industry of Southern California,"
Chillingworth said. "But the thoroughbred owners are a body that has
a purpose of looking out for the industry and I'm happy they agree
with us, that approval of this now would be too premature."</TE>
<TE>   The executive boards at Hollywood Park and Del Mar also oppose the
move because of the uncertain financial impact on their meets.</TE>
<TE>   Henwood and Santa Anita President Jack Liebau announced their
five-year lease agreement to move the fair meet May 23. Henwood
missed the deadline for including the change of venue on Thursday's
agenda by five days, but he successfully appealed to CHRB Executive
Director Roy Wood.</TE>
<TE>   John Harris, a CHRB board member, has already expressed strong
doubts he could approve the move with such limited time available for
analysis. Another board member, who asked not to be identified, said
that such a major decision should not be approved until next year.</TE>
<TE>   Although the CHRB has shown flexibility in authorizing race dates,
Liebau noted that all of the 2002 Southern California dates had been
approved Aug. 24, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Liebau contends that shifting the fair meet to Santa Anita will
result in greater profits for horsemen because of increased handle,
wider satellite wagering coverage and the addition of 10 turf races.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any idea [how the CHRB will view the thoroughbred
owners' decision], but we're disappointed by it," Liebau said.</TE>

<LD>   What: Driver #8</LD>
<LD>   Author: Dale Earnhardt Jr. with Jade Gurss</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Warner Books, Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $23.95</TE>
<TE>   So many books have been written the last few years on NASCAR that
it has been difficult to keep up with them. Much of it has been
written in the aftermath of Dale Earnhardt's death in the last lap of
the 2001 Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   The charm of this book is that it is different. It is more a
journal of a young man's rookie year in NASCAR's premier series,
Winston Cup, chronicling the stress Dale Earnhardt Jr. faced, on and
off the track, in competition with his famous father, who was also
his boss, through a thrilling and sometimes tedious season of 36
races.</TE>
<TE>   It was a year when his red No. 8 became as visible as his dad's
black No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Amusing is his version of how NASCAR officials became nervous when
a Rolling Stones writer--an African American--spent a week with Dale
Jr. in mid-season, telling him "to be careful to avoid a 'Rocker
incident," referring to the Atlanta pitcher's Sports Illustrated
debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Only seven pages, an epilogue, discuss his feelings following the
fatal accident and the frantic days and months that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Those seven pages are worth the price of the book.</TE>

<LD>Prime Minister Goeran Persson said he was too nervous to watch
Sweden's World Cup opener against England, according to the Swedish
news agency TT. The game ended in a 1-1 tie.</LD>
<LD>   Persson said he avoided television on Sunday but followed
developments with text messages on his cell phone and Center Party
leader Maud Olofsson, who finally called to tell him the final score.</LD>
<LD>   "I am among those who sit in a room on the side and have some kind
of contact via others' shouts and groans," Persson said.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a particularly nice experience, I was so
dreadfully nervous."</TE>

<LD>About 150 enraged soccer fans gathered in the capital of Minsk to
protest a lack of World Cup coverage on national television, calling
it an insult to a soccer-loving nation.</LD>
<LD>   As with all protests in tightly controlled Belarus, rows of police
monitored the crowd of mostly young men wearing soccer team
paraphernalia. No violence was reported.</LD>
<LD>   The protesters complained the government-run broadcaster had not
bought rights to show World Cup games. It was unclear why the
Belarusian National Broadcasting Company, did not obtain coverage
rights, though protesters said it was because the company is too
poor. Belarus has no major media outlets that aren't state
controlled.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an event of a planetary scale. To deprive an entire people
such viewing is to spit in the soul of each person," said protester
Vladlimir Akulich.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Through 29 games at Coors Field last season, teams combined to
average 14.79 runs and 3.21 home runs a game. Through 29 games this
season, entering Monday night, teams had averaged 9.97 runs and 2.07
home runs a game.</LD>
<LD>   No, pitching hasn't improved that much. Most attribute the lower
production in baseball's most hitter-friendly park to the fact the
Rockies have been storing game balls in a climate-controlled storage
facility in an effort to offset Denver's relatively low humidity.</LD>
<LD>   A Major League Baseball official inspected the humidor-like
structure and said it was in line with what Rawlings, the
manufacturer of the balls, would recommend, and ongoing analysis of
the balls has already shown a major difference.</LD>
<TE>   The team left a dozen baseballs out of the humidor on March 24 and
inspected them regularly to see if they continued to meet
specifications of a weight between 5 and 5.25 ounces.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-May, six of the 12 balls weighed less than the 5-ounce
minimum, and three others weighed exactly 5 ounces. The balls kept in
the humidor were within .01 ounce of their original weight.</TE>
<TE>   Simple physics dictates that a heavier baseball won't travel as
far as a lighter one.</TE>
<TE>   Pitchers love the humidor, and hitters grumble about it, but to
Dodger first baseman Eric Karros, the humidor isn't so much an issue
as it is a symptom of the game's ongoing problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is Major League Baseball is trying to change the
integrity of the game without talking [to the players]," Karros said.
"It's like they're trying to pull something behind your back. Nobody
even told us [about the humidor]. That, to me, is the issue. We're
trying to work out [a collective bargaining agreement], and this is
... how a certain part of the ownership group wishes to deal with
us."</TE>

<HD>Brown Suffers a New Setback</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Right-hander is hospitalized with back problem
and may need surgery. Dodgers beat Rockies in Denver, 11-5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Another Dodger victory, this one an 11-5 pasting of the Colorado
Rockies before a crowd of 30,150 on a chilly, rainy and windy Monday
evening in Coors Field, was overshadowed by some chilling news back
home.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Brown, the Dodger ace who is on the disabled list because of
inflammation in his surgically repaired right elbow, was admitted to
Centinela Hospital in Inglewood early Monday night because of a
protrusion, likely a bulging disk, in his lower back, a condition
that could require surgery and possibly sideline Brown for several
weeks, if not the remainder of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, in the fourth year of a seven-year, $106-million contract,
experienced such discomfort Sunday that he did not attend the game in
Dodger Stadium. He was in so much pain Monday that a team physician
suggested he be admitted to the hospital, where an MRI test showed
the protrusion.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know how he hurt it [or if it was an injury that
developed over time], but if he did hurt it, it wasn't at the park,"
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "Our main concern is still the elbow.
He won't begin throwing again until the fluid in the back of his
elbow dissipates. But he's in a very uncomfortable state right now
[because of his back], and we need to find out what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans was informed of Brown's situation
early Monday night, when team physical therapist Pat Screnar called
to inform Evans that the pain in Brown's back had reached a point
where he couldn't tolerate it any more at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not yet spoken to Dr. [Frank] Jobe [team physician], but
[Brown] is going to be examined, either late [Monday] night or
[today]," Evans said. "I don't want to speculate on it because I just
don't know ... the extent of the injury."</TE>
<TE>   News of Brown's latest setback--he's already been on the disabled
list twice this season and underwent surgery to repair a torn flexor
tendon in his elbow last September--did little to slow the Dodgers,
who won for the sixth time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   They got a little help Monday night--the victory was all but
gift-wrapped by Colorado reliever Jose Jimenez, whose wild throw on a
play that didn't even require a throw enabled the Dodgers to snap a
4-4 tie with two tack-on runs in their four-run eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers broke the game open with five runs in the ninth, an
inning capped by Adrian Beltre's three-run home run, but that
probably did little to ease the pain and embarrassment for Jimenez,
whose mental gaffe turned the game toward the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers trailed, 4-2, when Paul Lo Duca opened the eighth with
a single to right off reliever Todd Jones. Shawn Green doubled to
left, moving Lo Duca to third.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Manager Clint Hurdle summoned Jimenez, and Brian Jordan
singled to left, Lo Duca scoring and Green stopping at third, to make
it 4-3. Eric Karros then chopped a grounder over first baseman Todd
Helton's head for a double that scored Green with the tying run and
moved Jordan to third.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek grounded back to the pitcher, the runners
holding, and it appeared the Rockies were one step closer to snuffing
the rally when Beltre grounded back to Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan broke for the plate on contact and was hung up between
third and home. Jimenez ran toward Jordan, and with Karros well on
his way to third, all Jimenez had to do was run Jordan back to the
bag for an out, because the Dodgers would have had two runners on a
base.</TE>
<TE>   But as Karros slid into third, Jimenez inexplicably flipped the
ball toward third, and his wild throw sailed into left field,
allowing Jordan and Karros to score for a 6-4 Dodger lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies pulled within 6-5 in the bottom of the eighth when
Larry Walker blasted his 11th homer of the season off reliever Jesse
Orosco, an upper-deck shot that traveled an estimated 481 feet, the
ninth-longest homer in Coors Field history.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers loaded the bases in the top of the ninth, as Lo
Duca was hit by a pitch, Green singled and Jordan walked, and Karros
stroked a two-run single to left-center, giving him four runs batted
in Monday, seven in two games.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, mired in a one-for-14 slump, followed with a three-run
homer to center, extending the Dodgers' string of games with a home
run to 11.</TE>

<HD>Draft Could Be a Sign of Things to Come</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Today's picks to feature international talent as
trend becomes a bargaining issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major league baseball's annual amateur draft will take a historic
turn today when Canada's Adam Loewen and Jeff Francis are selected in
the first round.</LD>
<LD>   The left-handed pitchers, both from British Columbia, are
projected to be among the top 15 picks in the 50-round draft, the
first time two Canadians will be among the first 30 players chosen
overall.</LD>
<LD>   The growing presence of the Great White North in the draft is the
latest example of the continuing globalization of America's pastime.
Today's events, however, are probably only a harbinger of things to
come for a draft that has been, for the most part, an all-American
affair since its inception in 1965 when Arizona State outfielder Rick
Monday was selected with the first pick.</LD>
<TE>   But future top picks seem as likely to come from Santo Domingo in
the Dominican Republic ... or Sapporo, Japan ... or Sao Paulo,
Brazil, or even Siberia.</TE>
<TE>   Major league club owners and the Major League Baseball Players
Assn. both have proposals on the bargaining table related to a
worldwide draft. Among negotiating issues, the draft ranks well
behind a luxury tax on high payrolls and increased revenue sharing
among the owners, but each side has a stake in its implementation.</TE>
<TE>   Owners are fed up with paying multimillion-dollar bonuses to both
domestic draftees and foreign free agents. A majority of owners also
believe that big-budget teams such as the Dodgers, New York Yankees
and Atlanta Braves have left an unlevel playing field for procuring
international amateur players.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a bidding war for the upper-echelon players
internationally, and most teams cannot pay the price," said Kevin
Towers, general manager of the San Diego Padres.</TE>
<TE>   The union's interest in a worldwide draft is viewed as largely
symbolic, a potential bargaining chip in what historically have been
acrimonious labor negotiations. The players also may have a vested
interest: Dollars not spent on unproven talent could be pumped into
big league salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Scouting directors agree that, when it comes to the draft, this
year is possibly the start of a new world order when it comes to
identifying and signing international talent.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have the competitive level come back to earth," said
Duane Shaffer, senior director of scouting for the Chicago White Sox.
"You have to spread the talent around evenly and let the best people
put together the best team."</TE>
<TE>   The draft, held each June, currently covers players in the United
States, Canada and Puerto Rico, though foreign players attending U.S.
schools are also eligible. Players can be drafted during their senior
year in high school, while attending a junior college, after their
junior year at a four-year college or if they turn 21 within 45 days
of the draft.</TE>
<TE>   That has not stopped scouts from finding and signing global
talent.</TE>
<TE>   According to figures released by the commissioner's office, of 849
players on major league rosters or the disabled list on opening day,
26.1% were born outside the 50 United States, an increase of nearly
6% since 1998. The players came from 15 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 50% of the 5,781 players signed to minor league contracts
were born outside the continental United States. Some 2,865 came from
31 countries, including 1,536 alone from the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   The success of foreign players such as reigning American League
most valuable player Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners, the
Olympic Games, satellite television and the Internet all have helped
the game grow internationally. As the growth continues, so will the
talent pool available to major league teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a believer that in 10 years or less, China is going to be
involved," said Chuck McMichael, an Atlanta Brave scout who has been
involved on the local, national and international level for 22 years.
"Within five or less, Europe is going to be heavily involved."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball, fearful of losing its antitrust exemption, was the last
of the four major professional sports in the United States to adopt a
draft. The National Football League was the first in 1936, the
National Basketball Assn. next in 1947 and the National Hockey League
held its first draft in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   In absence of a draft, baseball owners agreed to a bonus rule in
1946 to discourage and penalize teams for shelling out big dollars to
sign amateur players. It was scrapped in 1957 because teams found
creative ways to sidestep the rule every time it was modified.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, the Pittsburgh Pirates made Lomita High graduate Paul
Petit the first $100,000 bonus baby. In 1961, the Pirates again set a
bonus record by giving Long Beach Wilson shortstop Bob Bailey
$175,000.</TE>
<TE>   But the watershed moment in pre-draft history came in 1964 when
Rick Reichardt, a football and baseball star at the University of
Wisconsin, signed with the Los Angeles Angels for $205,000. In that
same year, according to draft historian Allan Simpson of Baseball
America magazine, major league teams spent $7 million to sign amateur
players--more than they spent on major league salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, when owners finally decided to move forward with a
draft, they achieved a short-term victory of sorts when the Kansas
City Athletics selected Monday No. 1 out of Arizona State and signed
him for $104,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bonuses increased relatively slowly until 1978 when outfielder
Kirk Gibson signed with the Detroit Tigers for $200,000. In 1989,
Louisiana State pitcher Ben McDonald signed with the Baltimore
Orioles for $350,000 and John Olerud, a pitcher and first baseman,
received $575,000 from the Toronto Blue Jays as part of major league
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Brien Taylor was the first player to break the $1-million
mark when he signed with the Yankees for $1.55 million in 1991.
Pitcher Kris Benson got $2 million from the Pirates in 1996 and third
baseman Pat Burrell received $3.15 million from the Philadelphia
Phillies in 1998 as part of an $8-million major league deal.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, signing bonuses for first-round picks ranged from the
$900,000 that the St. Louis Cardinals paid pitcher Justin Pope as the
No. 28 selection, to the $5.15 million that high school catcher Joe
Mauer received from the Minnesota Twins as the No. 1 overall pick.
Mark Prior of USC was selected No. 2 by the Chicago Cubs. His
$4-million bonus was less than Mauer's, but his deal included a major
league contract that increased the worth of the pact to $10.5
million, the most by a drafted player in history.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bonuses paid to foreign players also have increased.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started, you could still sign players in Latin
America for $3,000, $5,000 or $10,000. If you got into $20,000 or
$25,000, it was a pretty big money," said Jeff Schugel, the Dodgers'
director of international scouting. "Now the low end is $25,000 to
$50,000, and the high end is as much as they are getting in the high
rounds of the draft."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who have a staff of about 20 full- or part-time
international scouts, did not have a first-round pick in last year's
draft, so they took the money that would have been spent on a
domestic player and signed 16-year-old Dominican shortstop Irvin Joel
Guzman for $2.25 million. In April, the Dodgers signed Dominican
pitcher Jonathan Corporan for $930,000, although the deal could be
voided because of questions surrounding his age.</TE>
<TE>   To curb that kind of spending on free agents, the owners are
proposing one 40-round draft that would include amateur players from
every country but Cuba. Any player not selected in the draft would be
a free agent eligible to negotiate with any team. Those already
playing in professional leagues in their countries would not be
eligible and would continue to go through a posting system as Suzuki
of the Mariners and pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii of the Dodgers did in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The union proposal calls for two drafts--one eight-round draft for
amateur players from the United States and one eight-round draft for
amateur foreign players. Players not selected could negotiate with
any team.</TE>
<TE>   "Our proposal is pretty simple--it would give all clubs equal
access to the best talent in the world," said Rob Manfred, baseball's
executive vice president of labor relations. "The union proposal
would be a disaster. It would take 42 rounds of players currently
picked in the [50-round] domestic draft and turn them into free
agents.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if they are free agents, the teams with the most money
would get the best players, and we think that would be bad for
competitive balance."</TE>
<TE>   Gene Orza, deputy to union chief Donald Fehr, said the union
proposal would still protect the negotiating rights of most players
not currently subject to the draft, which he describes as an
"essentially insidious thing" that restrains the right to freely
market one's skills.</TE>
<TE>   He said calling the union's proposal a disaster is
counterproductive. "Is that the kind of language that gets the
players' association to be sympathetic to their concerns?" Orza said.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Scott Boras, whose representation of players such as Taylor,
1997 holdout J.D. Drew and others changed the economics of the draft,
said baseball has several political and logistical obstacles to
overcome if it intends to implement a worldwide draft. Boras favors a
two-draft setup that would include scouting combines at various
locations around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone can reduce their scouting costs by having combines,"
Boras said. "By having these combines, we're all going to know where
[the players] are, and they are going to be seen. They are going to
learn about the system, clubs are going to learn about them, and they
are going to better spend their money."</TE>
<TE>   Deric Ladnier, scouting director for the Kansas City Royals, said
he would welcome a worldwide draft. In today's market, Ladnier said,
the Royals cannot compete for premium Latin American players because
of budget constraints.</TE>
<TE>   "It may allow us to draft a Latin American player that, normally,
would be a guy we wouldn't be able to walk in the front door and try
to sign because the Yankees or Dodgers might sign him for a million
dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Ladnier, however, said that a worldwide draft would not cause the
Royals to set up a scouting operation in the Pacific Rim or other
international outposts as many other teams have.</TE>
<TE>   "If other teams want to fight it out for a player over there, it
might allow us to get a player from the United States that we may
have normally not been able to compete for," Ladnier said. "That's a
good thing for us. And for other small-market teams."</TE>

<TE>   The order of selection for the 2002 first-year player draft
scheduled for today and Wednesday includes 11 compensation picks
between the first and second rounds, nine for Type A free agents lost
after the 2001 season and two additional picks for the failure of the
Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Indians to sign first-round picks in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Teams are awarded compensation in the form of draft picks based on
the type of free agent involved.</TE>
<TE>   A team losing a Type A free agent gets the first-round pick of the
team that signs the player, as well as a supplemental pick. A team
losing a Type B free agent receives only the signing team's top pick.
In both cases, a team selecting in the top half of the draft rotation
cannot lose its first-round pick.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of a Type C free agent provides a team a pick between the
second and third rounds. Teams losing Type C free agents to minor
league contracts will only be compensated if the player makes another
club's major league roster.</TE>

<HD>Ecuador No Match for Italy, 2-0</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>NIIGATA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Ecuador looked every bit the part of a wide-eyed World Cup
first-timer Monday, marveling at the wondrous sights all around--the
plush grass field inside the high-tech Sapporo Dome, the filled
stands, the two goals in the first half-hour by Italy's Christian
Vieri.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the Ecuadoreans had settled down and settled in, their
first-ever World Cup match was fairly determined--a 2-0 loss to Italy
at Sapporo, Japan, and a quick assignment to last place in Group G.</LD>
<LD>   "The players were very nervous and they were not quite ready,"
Ecuador Coach Hernan Dario Gomez acknowledged. "But we played very
well in the second half and we are not discouraged."</LD>
<TE>   Ecuador, which plays its next game against Mexico on Sunday in
Miyagi, was knocked back early by two Vieri goals in a span of seven
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The first, in the seventh minute, came after Italy's Francesco
Totti had broken down the left side of the Ecuador defense, carrying
the ball almost to the end line before laying it back for Vieri just
outside the top of the penalty area. Vieri drove the ball into the
upper right corner of the net past goalkeeper Jose Cevallos and Italy
led, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes later, Vieri struck again, this time taking a long
feed, shedding his defender and powering a low shot that caromed off
Cevallos' leg and rolled behind the keeper. Vieri kept running,
easily beating Cevallos to the ball for the tap-in.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to [dedicate] my goals to the doctors of the national
team," said Vieri, who has been bothered by hamstring, ankle and knee
ligament ailments during the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "They have helped me get back to fitness and that meant I was able
to score these two goals."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said he was encouraged by his team's performance in the
second half, when Ecuador produced several scoring chances after
Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni made substitutions.</TE>
<TE>   "We did OK and we have the strength now to go on from this in the
next two matches," Gomez said. "Italy are a very strong team and
probably one of the strongest in the World Cup."</TE>

<HD>Agassi Plays Card Right</HD>
<DH>French Open: He gets by wild-card entry after trailing two
sets to love and facing two break points at 1-3 in fifth set.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The five sets that changed Andre Agassi's life three years ago are
still working, displaying a remarkable shelf life, almost becoming
something of a security blanket at the French Open.</LD>
<LD>   They just weren't any five sets. Agassi lost the first two in the
1999 final to Andrei Medvedev here and won the last three. It was the
third time Agassi had rallied from a two-sets-to-love deficit,
winning the only Grand Slam tournament title that had eluded him.</LD>
<LD>   Since then Medvedev has gone the other way, never reaching another
final. He is all but retired in Monte Carlo, working on real estate
deals in his native Ukraine.</LD>
<TE>   Thus, those five sets turned Andre the tennis player into Andre
the icon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Agassi," said Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu. "This is not
somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Mathieu should know, after following Medvedev's path Monday at the
French Open. He took the first two sets and dropped the last three,
as the fourth-seeded Agassi won, 4-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. As in
Agassi-Medvedev, there were brief rain delays. And Agassi landed in
an even more precarious predicament against the 20-year-old wild-card
entrant from France than he had against Medvedev, falling behind a
service break in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't quite "Groundhog Day," but close enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly dug a big hole for myself," said Agassi, who won the
fourth-round match in 3 hours 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot had to do with the way he was playing. But down two sets
and a break, I mean, the good news is, it can't get any worse."</TE>
<TE>   Well ...</TE>
<TE>   It almost did. Trailing, 1-3, in the fifth, Agassi faced two break
points, saving one with a smash and the other with a forehand winner.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not do anything," Mathieu said. "He played great shots on
those two points."</TE>
<TE>   From then on, it was all Agassi, as he won the final five games,
losing only four points in the final four. At 5-3, Agassi held at
love, finishing it off with a nice touch shot, flicking a backhand
half-volley. You get a sense of Agassi's plight in this statistic:
eight drop shots won. He pulled a reluctant Mathieu forward, a clever
strategy on several levels, pulling him up from behind the baseline
and keeping him off-balance.</TE>
<TE>   "You can be assured if I'm hitting a lot of drop shots, there's a
lot not feeling great out there," Agassi said. "A lot has to kind of
go awry for me to feel like that's something to throw into the
equation."</TE>
<TE>   In the quarterfinals Wednesday, Agassi will play No. 11 Juan
Carlos Ferrero of Spain in their first meeting. Ferrero beat Gaston
Gaudio of Argentina in an erratic fourth-round match, 6-7 (3), 6-1,
6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4, in 3 hours 50 minutes. They combined for 186
unforced errors, and Ferrero said his injured right ankle is about
80%.</TE>
<TE>   For French supporters, the program wasn't a total loss. Frenchman
Sebastien Grosjean, seeded 10th, defeated Xavier Malisse of Belgium,
6-2, 7-5, 6-3, in another fourth-round match. Grosjean, who reached
the semifinals here last year, will play No. 2 Marat Safin of Russia.
Safin grew frustrated, tossing his racket--what else is new?--and
defeated wild card Arnaud Di Pasquale of France, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   The departure of two French wild cards might have wounded local
pride, but the loss of Agassi and Safin would have severely damaged
the star quality of this event, which took a hit when No. 1 Lleyton
Hewitt of Australia and two-time defending champion Gustavo Kuerten
of Brazil lost Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   For the 20-year-old Mathieu, the lack of big-match experience
eventually caught him for good in the fifth set.</TE>
<TE>   "I had pressure because, at 20 years old, on center court,
completely full, for a French player in the French Open," he said. "I
was able to deal with it, so I'm happy with that. It gave me
strength. But in the third set, I lacked experience. In the fifth
set, also, at the important time of the match. He was used to the
situation. That's what made the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Agassi] wants to win a specific point, he wins it. He lived
the situation 200 times already before, and for me it was the first
time."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, another 20-year-old was gone. Agassi has enjoyed, or at
least indulged, talk about the old Andre, the once-callow youth. The
year he lost in the French final, in 1990, he got here the day before
the tournament started and fell behind a set and a break against
Canadian Martin Wostenholme in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely didn't feel I gave myself the best shot possible,"
Agassi said. "Who knows? Maybe if I was doing that then, I'd be
sitting on my couch right now back home watching this tournament.
Every time I think about the things I could have done differently, I
take a lot of pleasure in the fact that I'm still here, doing things
the way I want."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was a report that former Australian Davis Cup captain John
Newcombe had told ABC radio that two-time U.S. Open winner Patrick
Rafter was contemplating a return later this year, with an eye on the
Australian Open in January.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody of Pat's athleticism might find it a lot easier than
others," Agassi said. "He still plays a game that a lot of these
other guys don't play. There will always be a place for a guy who is
that kind of athlete."</TE>
<TE>   Later, however, word came that such talk might be premature. What
exactly Newcombe said appeared open to debate, and those close to
Rafter indicated he probably won't know what he will be doing until
after his first child is born in late July.</TE>

<HD>Oh, the Humility! What a Team in Trouble Learned About
Itself</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.</LD>
<LD>   Well, almost the same, give or take a little heart flutter after
the Kings had shot holes in their over-inflated balloon, which spun
crazily all over the sky.</LD>
<LD>   That which didn't kill the Lakers made them stronger, and it came
close too. Under the gun for a week, they actually turned out to be
who they'd said they were.</LD>
<TE>   All it took to turn it around was some Robert Horry lightning in
Game 4; a taut win in Game 6, even if it will always be tainted by
their 27 free throws in the fourth quarter; and their Game 7 last
square dance in Arco, which stand cumulatively as the proudest
moments of their last three postseason engagements.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, or for a change, they were gracious in victory. Rick Fox,
their media-obliging prophet of doom, who had guaranteed this series
before being obliged to acknowledge that the Kings "definitely
brought an earthquake" in Games 3 and 4, was effusive in his praise.</TE>
<TE>   "They humbled us in a lot of ways," Fox said. "They fought
admirably. They really did. I can sit and talk all day about how
impressed we were with them."</TE>
<TE>   That was fortunate for the Lakers, who needed humbling in a lot of
ways.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were a welcome development, all around. It had been a
while since there was as much suspense at the elite level. The Lakers
went 30-9 the last two playoffs, the San Antonio Spurs 15-2 before
them. The Chicago Bulls owned the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won their titles with ridiculous ease. In 2000, they
had two nervous days after losing Games 3 and 4 in Sacramento but
they were still playing Game 5 at home, where the Kings collapsed on
schedule and lost by 27.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, the Lakers led the West finals, 3-1, let
Portland tie it, then saw the Trail Blazers go up 15 points in the
fourth quarter of Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the Lakers had a bad half hour before they rallied
and Portland collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Lakers went 15-1 last spring and decided, along with the
rest of the world, that they were omnipotent and wouldn't need to
worry about the regular season any longer.</TE>
<TE>   Then, along came the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were 7-1 going into this series, even if it seemed as
if they were there for the taking, if only there were someone good
enough to take them.</TE>
<TE>   Now, under pressure, the Lakers' lack of balance was exposed.
Their roster, which had actually been upgraded, was compared
unfavorably with last season's. People started praising old Horace
Grant, who had been waived.</TE>
<TE>   And whatever happened to Isaiah Rider?</TE>
<TE>   Actually little had changed. The Lakers are a Shaquille
O'Neal-Kobe Bryant joint venture with helpers. Orlando Coach Doc
Rivers says it's the first time the game's most dominating big man
has played with one of its best, or its best, perimeter players.</TE>
<TE>   Here they are in living color, most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq was only faintly Shaq this time around, except in the weight
department, where he was more Shaq than he had ever been, and then
Kobe ate that poison cheeseburger.</TE>
<TE>   (By the way, can we get off that burger? As fun as it is to
speculate on the machinations of Laker foes, several physicians have
suggested the one-week duration of Bryant's symptoms indicate it
might well have been a virus, rather than food poisoning, which is
typically short-lived.)</TE>
<TE>   With the Big Two doing imitations of themselves, the Little 10
were lost. The Laker role players are good at what they
do--especially when it comes to understanding their limitations--but
none is adept at getting his own shot so, in the absence of the usual
leadership, they were in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for the Lakers, O'Neal, properly alarmed, even at 345
pounds (his estimate) or 360 or 375, was almost as good as he had
ever been, which is to say, monstrous.</TE>
<TE>   After averaging 22 points against the Spurs and 27 in the first
five games in this series, he finished with a thunderous 76 and 30
rebounds in Games 6-7.</TE>
<TE>   King Coach Rick Adelman complained that the officiating had
changed but it was Shaq who'd changed.</TE>
<TE>   He'd stopped backing his man in to avoid charges. At the other
end, he'd stopped complaining and started getting out of the way
early in games, waving Kings to the hoop like a school crossing guard
escorting kids across the street.</TE>
<TE>   If the Kings were now getting all the fouls and he was shooting
all the free throws, what else was new? He's Shaq. How else is Vlade
Divac going to deal with him except to foul him?</TE>
<TE>   Bryant started looking more like Bryant and even under all the
duress the Kings could bring, form asserted itself. These Lakers had
won two championships but never did they prove what champions they
were the way they did last week.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey Nets are next, heavy underdogs but in high spirits,
feeling themselves a team of fate. "Destiny vs. dynasty," Jason Kidd
is calling it.</TE>
<TE>   The indomitable Kidd all but willed New Jersey through the East,
even if the operative word is "East." Kidd was a great player in the
West, too, but got as far as the second round only once.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have decent size--7-0 Todd MacCulloch, 7-0 Jason Collins,
6-10 Keith Van Horn, 6-9 Aaron Williams, 6-9 Kenyon Martin--but in
the West, you have to deal with teams that are bigger than that.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Mt. St. O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   In his only game against the Nets this season, Shaq had 40 points
and 12 rebounds. The Nets will try not to upset him but the Kings
didn't just wake him up, it's more as if they interrupted his nap by
trying to steal his Escalade SUV with the Superman logo on the grill
and set the alarm off.</TE>
<TE>   He's awake, he's rolling, good luck.</TE>
<TE>   The early line: Two Net wins and they'll hold a parade. Three and
there'll be parades in New Jersey and Manhattan. If they win the
series, it'll be like Lindbergh returning from Paris.</TE>
<TE>   If not, well, we'll always have Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>He's Sacrificing Again</HD>
<DH>Baseball: The same kind of tough choice that led to
coaching has Donatella leaving powerful Sylmar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Donatella knows all about choices, how bad news can alter one's
plans in life and how an orange Volkswagen Beetle can drastically
change the vectors of a career path.</LD>
<LD>   He was 19 when he had to make his first major decision, en route
to a baseball career at a community college in Valencia, when his
father was laid off as an aircraft engineer.</LD>
<LD>   It was 1973. The war in Vietnam was ending. The economy struggled,
in particular his father's manufacturing sector, as the U.S. dollar
grew softer and oil prices soared.</LD>
<TE>   Donatella was forced to pick up the tab for his shiny new Beetle,
payments that a few months earlier had been made by his father. A
hundred bucks a month, another $25 or $30 for insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't figure out a way to play baseball and pay for the
car," Donatella said. "I had to make a decision."</TE>
<TE>   A playing career ended. The foundation for a coaching career
began.</TE>
<TE>   Donatella started work toward a physical education degree at
College of the Canyons, then finished it at Cal State Northridge, all
while putting in 30 hours a week at an aircraft supply store in
Burbank. Well before he became known as the nuts-and-bolts baseball
coach at Sylmar High, he was in charge of packing and shipping screws
and wing nuts at the supply store.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough sometimes," he said. "I went there after school
while a lot of my buddies were out playing ball or messing around."</TE>
<TE>   Familiar with sacrifice at an early age, Donatella, 48, had to
make another choice this season: After 14 years at Sylmar, he will
resign from coaching baseball after the Spartans play Cleveland High
for the City Section championship tonight at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   His son, Justin, 7, is starting to blossom as a youth baseball
player. Donatella saw only seven of Justin's 22 games this season. He
doesn't want to miss any next season.</TE>
<TE>   "Two practices a week, batting cages every Wednesday night, two
games a week.... He hadn't had that schedule before," Donatella said.
"It seemed like the timing was right [to step down]."</TE>
<TE>   But not before he coaches in a championship game for the first
time. The top-seeded Spartans (27-4) are a model of Donatella's past
teams, with discipline, dignity and an actual sense of community, a
rarity in these days of open enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   Every player on this year's roster is from Sylmar, with the
exception of third baseman/pitcher Francisco Molina, an exchange
student from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to have the kids that are supposed to come to Sylmar High
School," said Donatella, who graduated from Sylmar in 1972. "I
believe in a community school. We always have enough good players at
our school to be competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Donatella is simple, yet stern. If a player doesn't follow the
rules, he gets benched. If grades start to slip, so will his plate
appearances. It's a system the players have bought into.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing coaches have also taken note of it.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll let his kids know what is expected of them and if they
don't take care of business, they're not around," said Granada Hills
Kennedy Coach Manny Alvarado, also in his 14th season. "It's kind of
old school. He holds the kids accountable for their actions."</TE>
<TE>   Donatella, who has a career record of 402-180 in 20 seasons,
coached at Marshall High for six seasons before arriving at Sylmar in
1989. The Spartans advanced to the playoff semifinals that year and
would have gone to Dodger Stadium if not for a three-run home run by
Garret Anderson, now with the Angels, that led Kennedy past Sylmar,
8-7.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, the Spartans made it back to the semifinals, but
lost to San Fernando and swift-throwing right-hander Ray Rivera who,
coincidentally, is now the Sylmar pitching coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny how things happen," Donatella said. "We've got a
stockpile of pitchers who have worked with him. He's a big reason why
we are where we're at today."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera is the leading candidate to replace Donatella, who will
still teach P.E. at Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   As Donatella reflects on his career, he remembers the path he took
to become a coach, how his father found work again within a year or
two before retiring, and how he is a game away from semi-retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "As it turned out, everything worked out," Donatella said. "It's
been fun."</TE>

<HD>Liaw Accustomed to Role</HD>
<DH>High school golf: He is again the one to beat at the CIF
finals, which begin today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no question that Henry Liaw is the player to beat in the
CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. high school finals today at the
SCGA Members Club in Murrieta.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since he shot a mind-boggling 58 in a junior tournament at
age 12, Liaw (rhymes with wow) has been marked as the player to beat
in every tournament he's entered.</LD>
<LD>   "They always say, 'If you beat Henry, you win the tournament,'"
said Nick Liaw, Henry's father.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the time, they are right.</TE>
<TE>   Liaw, 16, of Hacienda Heights Los Altos High, has won four junior
world championships, two shy of the record held by Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, he joined Woods and Mike Brannon as the only
15-year-olds to win the U.S. Junior title.</TE>
<TE>   A two-time Southern California player of the year, Liaw was a
junior All-American selection by the American Junior Golf Assn. last
year.</TE>
<TE>   But it was that 58 he shot in July of 1999 that put Liaw at the
forefront of the junior golf scene.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, whenever I went to a tournament people looked at me
and realized I was capable of shooting something really deep," Liaw
said. "But I look at it as encouragement, not pressure."</TE>
<TE>   The inevitable comparisons with Woods soon followed, but Liaw pays
little attention to it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody that's going to be the next Tiger Woods," Liaw
said. "All you can be is yourself."</TE>
<TE>   And even though Liaw has two more shots to match Woods as the only
repeat champion in the U.S. Junior (Woods won three from 1991-93),
equaling the junior achievements of Woods is not Liaw's ultimate
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a junior career," Liaw said. "I'm satisfied with
what I've done, but I want to do more. I want to dominate the game. I
want to be one of the best ever."</TE>
<TE>   Liaw routinely spends four to eight hours a day at the golf
course, honing his skills. He has enlisted a swing coach, a
short-game coach and a golf-specific fitness trainer.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up junk food, cut back on soda and has lost nearly 40
pounds. At the same time he has gained about 30 yards off the tee to
complement an impeccable short game.</TE>
<TE>   "He can be the best," said Jerry Wong, the only swing coach Liaw
has had. "He can be No. 1 in the world. I would not be surprised at
all by that."</TE>
<TE>   Liaw won his first Junior World championship in 1996 at age 10 and
subsequently became the player to beat in every tournament.</TE>
<TE>   He responded by winning 18 consecutive Southern California PGA
junior tournaments, a streak second only to the record 32 won by
Woods. Liaw then burst onto the national scene when he made 10
birdies, an eagle and seven pars to shoot 58.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kevin Ostroske, director of junior golf for the
Southern California PGA, that success has prepared Liaw better
mentally than any player he can remember.</TE>
<TE>   "To deal with that pressure and those expectations at age 12 is
pretty tough," Ostroske said. "But he has continued to be
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Liaw knows he has a long way to go to become one of the
all-time greats. He has not been tempted by the recent surge of
teenagers turning professional and includes a college degree among
his career goals.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no need to rush into it," Liaw said. "For me, even when
I shoot 64 or 65, I still have that feeling inside where I just
happened to have a really good day. That's my indicator that I'm not
ready.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to feel like when I go out there, 65 or 66 is not a
problem. I don't want to feel like I'm grinding just to shoot
one-under par."</TE>

<LD>The Lakers rested Monday after returning Sunday night to Los Angeles,
and will practice today in El Segundo in preparation for the NBA
Finals opener Wednesday night at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The down time was earned, considering how hard Phil Jackson pushed
them in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant played 52 minutes, Shaquille O'Neal played 51, Robert
Horry played 49 and Rick Fox 48, 72 hours before Game 1 against the
New Jersey Nets.</LD>
<TE>   In the second half and the overtime period, Jackson used his bench
for only nine minutes--four by Lindsey Hunter, two each by Slava
Medvedenko and Devean George and one by Brian Shaw. Shaw's two points
accounted for the only scoring from the reserves in the final 29
minutes. Conversely, Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman employed 36 bench
minutes after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the stat sheet, all those guys played all those minutes,"
assistant coach Jim Cleamons said. "They needed the off day. Jersey's
got to travel. So, I think we'll be fine and rested."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the "intestinal fortitude" required to play those
minutes in such a close game with so much at stake, Fox smiled and
said, "My intestines almost fell out. That's a lot of playing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In two games against the Nets, the Lakers made 44.6% of their
shots and 42.5% of their three-point tries.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 40 points in his only game against them, and Bryant
scored 33 in his only game against them. Derek Fisher averaged 15.0
points in two games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In 15 playoff games, O'Neal is shooting 64.3% from the free-throw
line and 51% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   If he maintains both paces, it would be only the second postseason
of his career in which he shot a higher percentage from the line than
from the field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Horry, on O'Neal's Games 6 and 7, in which he averaged 37.5 points
and 15 rebounds: "That's why he's a mega-superstar. No telling how
bad he's really hurting. He's been carrying us. All you can do is
hang on to Superman's cape for the ride."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker assistant coach Frank Hamblen's early competition in Denver,
where they're interviewing head coach candidates: Eddie Jordan, Tubby
Smith, Del Harris, Donn Nelson, interim coach Mike Evans (who
replaced Dan Issel) and Clyde Drexler.</TE>
<TE>   It is likely that Hamblen, a friend of Nugget assistant general
manager David Fredman, would interview after the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy with what I do," he said. "There should be a process,
and I've never been one to politic about those things."</TE>
<TE>   Hamblen has been a head coach once, when he took over for Harris
midway through the 1991-92 season in Milwaukee.</TE>

<KH>NBA FINALS NEW JERSEY VS. LAKERS</KH>
<HD>In Close Quarters, They've Given No Quarter</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Playing their best when the games were
tightest, Lakers rose to meet the Kings' challenge. Now comes
another, against the Nets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't advice as much as it was opinion from Chris Webber, an
observation more than a warning from a man once sure he had the
Lakers beaten. In the difficult minutes after his Sacramento Kings
had been eliminated by the Lakers, hours before the New Jersey Nets
were to take flight for Los Angeles, a hang-dog Webber frowned and
set Byron Scott and the fellas straight.</LD>
<LD>   "The Lakers are the champions and they're the best team until
somebody beats them," he said. "You have to do it decisively. It
can't be close."</LD>
<LD>   Close almost always goes to the Lakers. Six of the seven games in
the Western Conference finals were decided by seven points or fewer,
and the Lakers won four, two in the funhouse that is Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers are 11 series into their three-peat, which takes 12.
The most recent series nearly finished them before it was done,
played as it was through food poisoning and early-onset arthritis and
crooked shooting, concluding finally with Phil Jackson in their
faces, chiding them into defending their basket and their titles.</TE>
<TE>   "What impressed me the most, we were down [three games to two],
and we had practice the next day," Kobe Bryant said. "Nobody was
hanging their heads. Nobody. Everybody was excited about the
challenge. You would have thought we had the 3-2 lead."</TE>
<TE>   The final game was as frantic as Jackson had promised, and as
sweat-soaking a game as these Lakers had ever played, and they slept
Monday, for Wednesday will bring the Nets, next up, fresh and eager
and sure their series with the Lakers will be different from the last
11.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd, a versatile point guard and the very reason the Nets
are here, called the best-of-seven series "Destiny vs. Dynasty," and
you can easily figure out who's who, since anything memorable in the
Nets' history was done with a red, white and blue basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Nets are sure. Well, pretty sure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's meant to be, I think," said New Jersey forward Kenyon
Martin, who can be quite normal off the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Characteristically for the Lakers, it will be less about the Nets,
champions of a conference of weaklings, than about themselves,
assuming Shaquille O'Neal's arthritis medication stays high and
Bryant's dinner stays down. The fact is, they seem to have their
hearts set on a third consecutive championship, accomplished only
four times before, and in the last three seasons, they often have
gotten what they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, ultimately, that's what everybody would want, speaking
of the franchise," Bryant said. "But for us, we can't think of it on
that grand a scale."</TE>
<TE>   They have found inspiration in every corner, even in their
momentary failures.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we just kind of swept through the playoffs," Bryant
said. "But to be tested like this, right here, right now, and to
respond the way we have, it's a lot of momentum. We have a lot of
confidence in each other."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers split two games with the Nets in the regular season,
though Bryant was suspended for the first and O'Neal did not play
because of injury in the second.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets also were short-handed. The volatile Martin and center
Todd MacCulloch did not play in the Lakers' 101-92 victory in Los
Angeles on March 5, when O'Neal made 16 of 21 shots and scored 40
points.</TE>
<TE>   On April 3 in East Rutherford, O'Neal had a sprained right wrist
and the Nets won, 94-92. Bryant scored 33 points but missed a
point-blank put-back at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets run the Princeton offense, apparently a requirement in
New Jersey. Kidd runs it, actually, some say better than any of the
Kings do. Scott, the Net coach who was a Laker for 11 seasons, lacks
the end-to-end roster talent of the Kings, however, and most expect
the Lakers to have an easier time with the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jim Cleamons, the Laker assistant who scouted the Nets
during the regular season, called them "a very worthy opponent," and
he's the one married to the VCR. And Jim O'Brien, coach of the
vanquished Boston Celtics, predicted a Net championship, though it's
possible that's Eastern Conference provincialism. His father-in-law,
Jack Ramsay, has the Lakers in six.</TE>
<TE>   "They do a wonderful job sharing the ball," Cleamons said. "They
open up the basket behind you. They bring the center up [to the top
of the lane]. They're always cutting to the basket, or coming up off
of screens. So, you turn your head, there he goes. They do a
wonderful job, man.</TE>
<TE>   "Even more so, they play a team game. We try to play a team game.
So, I think it's going to be good for basketball, in the sense you're
going to have two teams playing five-man concepts, passing, cutting,
rebounding. It's going to come back to skills, which team is the most
skillful, can execute the best, and play good, solid defense."</TE>

<HD>Mexico Marks His Words</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Team's 1-0 opening victory over Croatia lives up
to Aguirre's predictions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NIIGATA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Javier Aguirre is not Mexican soccer's answer to Phil Jackson. For
one thing, Aguirre has no soul patch. For another, the closest weapon
he has to Shaquille O'Neal is a bald goalie named Oscar who is small
enough to hide inside Shaq's equipment bag.</LD>
<LD>   But what do you call a coach who gets in the face and under the
skin of his opening World Cup opponent, raising Croatian eyebrows as
he adds yet another motivational posting to the team bulletin board,
and then comes through on game day with a plan cagey enough to make
Mexico, for one day at least, big in Japan?</LD>
<LD>   The Yen Master?</LD>
<TE>   Mexico's coach said Croatia was too old. He said Croatia was
living on 4-year-old results. He said he knew enough about Croatia to
realize his lightly regarded squad had more than a puncher's chance
against the 1998 World Cup bronze medalists.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the evidence supplied during Mexico's 1-0 victory at
Niigata's Big Swan Stadium on Monday, only two things need be said
about Aguirre the provocateur:</TE>
<TE>   * The truth is the best defense.</TE>
<TE>   * When you're right, you're right.</TE>
<TE>   Croatia, looking every bit as spent as Aguirre advertised, got
precious little out of the men who energized the semifinal surge of
'98, forwards Davor Suker and Alen Boksic. After nearly taking World
Cup rookie Croatia to the final four years ago, neither Suker, now
34, nor Boksic, 32, lasted 70 minutes against Mexico. Before they
were mercifully pulled in the 64th and 67th minutes, Suker and Boksic
had combined for one shot, off-target at that.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's offense was far from vibrant, indulging Croatia in
long-ball practice during a scoreless, tedious first half. Mexico was
limited by a depleted midfield, thinned by the suspensions of Jesus
Arellano and Joahan Rodriguez. Croatia, however, seemed to lack the
will or the inspiration to push forward, spending so much time
passing the ball back that Mexico's sizable supporter section filled
the stadium with derisive whistling and boos.</TE>
<TE>   The tone of the game had turned so lackluster in the first hour
that one fleeting moment of flair, a back-heeled pass by Mexico's
Jared Borgetti to Cuauhtemoc Blanco, completely unhinged Croatia--and
the match with it.</TE>
<TE>   Borgetti's feed sprang Blanco through the middle of the Croatian
defense and he went barreling in head-on toward goal. Scrambling to
recover, Croatian defender Boris Zivkovic body-slammed Blanco in the
penalty area, sending the Mexican striker flying.</TE>
<TE>   As Blanco crumpled to the grass, referee Jun Lu of China was
pointing to the penalty spot. Seconds later, a red card for Zivkovic
followed.</TE>
<TE>   In the 60th minute, Blanco converted. Suddenly, Mexico had a goal
advantage, and a man advantage. Croatia, already sagging, was facing
an uphill climb without the legs and the lungs required for the
journey.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the penalty broke the game," Aguirre said. "With 10
players [for Croatia] and one goal, I thought we [could] manage the
game. We had to handle the team and we had to play better. It was a
crucial moment, the penalty."</TE>
<TE>   Desperate for any kind of spark, Croatia Coach Mirko Jozic quickly
moved Suker and Boksic to the bench and replaced them with Daniel
Saric and Mario Stanic. Croatian midfielder Zvonimir Soldo, already
denied by Mexican keeper Oscar Perez on a 47th-minute header, created
another anxious moment, driving a blast from the top of the area in
the 65th minute that short-hopped Perez and popped loose before he
lunged to gather the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Perez had to work to preserve the victory when, in stoppage time,
a long throw-in freed Croatia's Josip Simunic for a point-blank shot
that Perez somehow palmed away and onto the side netting.</TE>
<TE>   "The goalkeeper is the man of the match, I think," Aguirre said of
Perez. "He made a couple of really good saves."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre looked almost embarrassed when asked about his earlier
critical assessment of Croatia and how 90 minutes in Niigata
eventually proved him right.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre claimed he wasn't intentionally trying to play mind games
with Jozic--he was simply playing defense on behalf of his players.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not my game," he said. "I heard what the Croatia coach
said about us. At first I was quiet. He said we didn't have creative
players in the midfield. That's not my style, but I had to answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to play that kind of game. It was a good lesson.
That's my first and last time playing like that with the press."</TE>
<TE>   What could any Croatian say, other than what Soldo had to offer?</TE>
<TE>   "Mexico was good. We were not," Soldo said. "That is the problem."</TE>

<LD>A look at some of the top Southlandl prospects for Major League
Baseball's first-year player draft, today and Wednesday:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   SERGIO SANTOS</LD>
<TE>   Shortstop, Santa Ana Mater Dei High</TE>
<TE>   The smooth-fielding, power-hitting infielder has signed with USC.
Santos, 6 feet 3 and 200 pounds, hit over .500 on the varsity as a
freshman at Hacienda Heights Los Altos before transferring to Mater
Dei. He batted .440 with eight home runs and 29 RBIs as a sophomore;
hit .448 with three homers, 23 RBIs and 18 stolen bases as a junior;
and batted .372 with eight homers, 34 RBIs and 14 stolen bases this
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SCOTT MOORE</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop, Cypress High</TE>
<TE>   Moore, 6 feet 2 and 180 pounds, who has signed with Cal State
Fullerton, finished his high school career with a .385 batting
average, 26 home runs and 74 runs batted in. A preseason
All-American, he didn't disappoint, batting .329 with 11 home runs
and 25 RBIs this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ANTHONY REYES</TE>
<TE>   Right-handed pitcher, USC</TE>
<TE>   The junior has a 4-1 record with a 3.26 earned-run average for the
Trojans, who will play Stanford in a best-of-three NCAA
super-regional beginning Friday. Reyes, 6-1 and 205, has U.S.
national team experience. He played at Whittier California High,
going 7-1 with a 1.61 ERA as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GREG MILLER</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed pitcher, Anaheim Esperanza High</TE>
<TE>   After signing with California, Miller helped the Aztecs reach the
quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division I playoffs, where he
lost to Lakewood, 2-0. Miller, 6-5 and 175, struck out 137 batters
this season and walked only 20. He finished with a 9-4 record, along
with four saves, after going 4-1 as a junior.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BILL MURPHY</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed pitcher, Cal State Northridge</TE>
<TE>   Murphy experienced a wild outing on Saturday, when he walked nine
and hit two batters in four innings in a 7-5 NCAA regional loss to
host USC that ended the Matadors' season at 41-17. A 6-1, 190-pound
junior, Murphy had a 9-4 record, a 3.55 ERA and 129 strikeouts this
season. Last season, he was 10-4 with 86 strikeouts. He was 13-1 with
136 strikeouts as a senior at Riverside Arlington High.</TE>

<PH>NBA FINALS NEW JERSEY VS. LAKERS/ SERIES REPORT</PH>
<KH>NET NOTES</KH>
<HD>MacCulloch Will Play Big Role in Series</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All eyes will be on New Jersey Net center Todd MacCulloch in the NBA
Finals, just as they were on Portland's Dale Davis, San Antonio's
David Robinson and Sacramento's Vlade Divac in the earlier rounds.</LD>
<LD>   How MacCulloch fares against Shaquille O'Neal will be one of the
keys to the Nets' fortunes in their first Finals appearance.</LD>
<LD>   MacCulloch is a 7-foot, 280-pounder in his third season in the
NBA. If his name sounds familiar, it could be because he served as
Dikembe Mutombo's backup last season with the Philadelphia 76ers.</LD>
<TE>   Neither he nor Mutombo had much (any?) luck thwarting O'Neal in
the Finals last season, however. O'Neal averaged 33 points, 15.8
rebounds, 4.8 assists and 3.4 blocked shots during the Lakers'
five-game victory over the 76ers and was named the Finals most
valuable player for the second consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not an easy matchup for anyone," MacCulloch told a New
Jersey newspaper. "I'll do my best to try to push him out and make
him get tough catches and try to run the floor and look to be
aggressive against him offensively and see if I can get him in foul
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   So far, MacCulloch said the Nets haven't asked for his advice on
facing the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody on this team knows I was there," he joked.
"They were all on vacation last year. They weren't watching the
Finals. Even if they did, even though the Sixers were there, I wasn't
on the court too much."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had 40 points and 12 rebounds against the Nets in the
Lakers' victory March 5 at Staples Center. He sat out the Nets'
victory April 3 at Continental Airlines Arena because of a sprained
right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MacCulloch told the Newark Star-Ledger that he'll never forget
Game 1 last season against the Lakers, particularly seeing a
celebrity-filled Staples Center. One star stood out above the rest,
for MacCulloch, and it wasn't Jack or Dyan.</TE>
<TE>   "Wayne Gretzky," MacCulloch said of seeing his boyhood idol in the
courtside seats for the opening game of the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   MacCulloch hails from Winnipeg, Canada, and every good Canadian
boy and girl grows up a hockey fan first and foremost.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pete Carril, Sacramento King assistant coach and a mentor to New
Jersey Coach Byron Scott, was asked if the Nets had a chance to upset
the two-time defending champion Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "You bet they have a chance," said Carril, perhaps best known as
the former Princeton coach. "The Nets aren't as good at center as we
are, but it should be interesting. I don't think you can count them
out." Some people counted them out after that third game in Boston,
but that was foolish."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott grew up in Inglewood, sneaking into the Forum to watch
games, and later played opposite Magic Johnson in the Lakers'
backcourt in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he'll be facing Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a dream come true," Scott said. "To match wits with Phil
Jackson, who is one of the best coaches in the league, it's going to
be exciting."</TE>

<HD>Skier Lazutina Is Suspended</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larissa Lazutina of Russia, stripped of an Olympic gold medal after a
positive drug test, Monday was suspended for two years by the
International Ski Federation, a move expected to cost her two other
medals from the Salt Lake City Games.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, made at the federation's annual congress at
Portoroz, Slovenia, is valid as of Dec. 8, when Lazutina tested
positive for drugs, said Janez Kocijancic, a Slovene member of the
federation.</LD>
<LD>   Lazutina, 36, among the most decorated athletes in Winter Olympics
history, was earlier stripped of a gold medal in the 30K classical
race after testing positive for the endurance-bolster darbepoietin.
She had been allowed to keep two silver medals from earlier races
because she had passed tests after those events.</LD>
<TE>   Kocijancic told Associated Press that FIS later learned the
results of the Dec. 8 test were positive for darbepoietin.</TE>
<TE>   The FIS intends to inform the International Olympic Committee
about its ruling. IOC President Jacques Rogge said last month that
the body would strip Lazutina's medals once FIS announced any
sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The FIS also banned British skier Alain Baxter from competition
for three months, only two months after he was stripped of an Olympic
bronze medal for testing positive for methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Team Green will challenge driver Paul Tracy's runner-up finish in
the Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Barry Green said he had appealed the ruling by the Indy
Racing League that Tracy had not passed leader Helio Castroneves
before a yellow caution light was displayed on the next-to-last lap
of the May 26 race.</TE>
<TE>   IRL director of operations Brian Barnhart, who heard a protest by
Green the day after the race, ruled the yellow came out before the
pass, locking Castroneves in first place and Tracy in second.</TE>
<TE>   "The frame-by-frame video will show you that Paul Tracy has
completed the pass when the yellow light comes on. That is the only
accurate evidence that any of us has," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Tonya Harding's drunken-driving charge will go to trial Aug. 20 at
Vancouver, Wash., and a conviction could mean the first significant
jail time for the former Olympic figure skater.</TE>
<TE>   Harding's pickup crashed into a ditch April 20. Her blood-alcohol
level was measured by a sheriff's deputy at .16%--twice the legal
limit in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento County coroner's office said an autopsy of former
University of Washington cornerback Anthony Vontoure, 22, found no
obvious reason why he died in a violent struggle with Sacramento
County sheriff's deputies while being taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Results of toxicology tests won't be available for several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators said they found evidence of drug use in
the apartment where Vontoure was found about 4 a.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Vontoure, of San Ramon, died after struggling first with three
friends who were holding him down, then with officers who responded
and were attempting to restrain him in a patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carol Semple Thompson, 53, was selected for the U.S. Curtis Cup
team for a record 12th time. The biennial match of amateur golfers
from the U.S., Britain and Ireland is scheduled for Aug. 3-4 at
Pittsburgh.</TE>

<HD>Moore, Freeman Are Among Cuts</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The second phase of free agency began Monday as some of the most
productive NFL players of the last decade were released to create
salary-cap room.</LD>
<LD>   Among the casualties were receivers Antonio Freeman of Green Bay,
Derrick Alexander of Kansas City, Herman Moore of Detroit and Keenan
McCardell of Jacksonville; running back Jamal Anderson of Atlanta;
offensive tackle John Fina of Buffalo and linebacker Hardy Nickerson
of Jacksonville.</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Batch was released by Detroit, putting a relatively young
quarterback on the market. Washington cut defensive end Marco
Coleman, signed during owner Daniel Snyder's spending spree two years
ago.</LD>
<TE>   Pittsburgh cut linebacker Mike Jones, the defensive hero in the
St. Louis Rams' Super Bowl victory over Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   All of the players had been told they would be released.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was no salary cap, I can assure you he probably would be
on our team," Washington Coach Steve Spurrier said after cutting
Coleman and saving $3.5 million. "He's a good player and a good
person."</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville saved $6.5 million by cutting McCardell and
Nickerson.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, the fifth-leading receiver in Packer history, had been
negotiating with Green Bay on a reduced deal but agreed it was time
to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, a nine-year veteran, ended his career with the Falcons
as the third-leading rusher in team history with 5,336 yards.</TE>
<TE>   He led the Falcons to their only Super Bowl in 1999, but has been
hampered by two knee injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Moore had more than 100 catches each in 1995, '96 and '97,
including 123 in 1995. But he has been injured in recent seasons and
had only four receptions for 76 yards last year before being
sidelined after the 11th game because of a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   McCardell had 94 and 93 catches the last two seasons and had more
than 1,000 yards in four of his six seasons at Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   Fina was the last remaining member of the Bills' team that won AFC
titles from 1990-93.</TE>
<TE>   Batch, 27, had three years and $10 million left on his contract.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive lineman Brian Waters signed a one-year contract with
Kansas City.... Pittsburgh running back Amos Zereoue is recovering
from a liver ailment that left him hospitalized for three days, but
may not work out with the team until training camp begins. Zereoue
lost 15 pounds this spring after doctors found a cyst on his
liver.... Police at Fort Myers, Fla., arrested nine people and used
pepper spray early Sunday to disperse hundreds of patrons after a
fight broke out at a dance club following a fund-raising event for a
youth foundation sponsored by Javon Kearse of the Tennessee Titans.
Kearse, a native of Fort Myers, attended the event.</TE>

<DH>Stanley Cup finals: For Hurricanes to have a chance against
the heavily-favored Red Wings, they will need a superior series from
Irbe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Not too many people are giving Carolina much of a chance against the
Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup finals, which begin tonight at
Joe Louis Arena.</LD>
<LD>   That does not mean the Hurricanes feel the same way. Not in this
year of upsets. The New England Patriots, Arizona Diamondbacks and
Senegal were all major underdogs but that did not stop them from
winning.</LD>
<LD>   Carolina's biggest problem is that the Red Wings know this too.</LD>
<TE>   "I told the team it's not about being overconfident," Detroit
Coach Scotty Bowman said on Monday. "It is about how you are to play
when the game starts ... they are going to face a team that had 27
overtime games during the season; they have had 18 playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "When people say this team is better than this team; it doesn't
mean a darn thing. You have to go and do it. I have been on both
sides ... We have swept the last two times [in Stanley Cup final wins
over Washington and Philadelphia] but we also got swept [by New
Jersey] in '95."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see why the Red Wings are so heavily favored.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit is an Original Six NHL franchise with arguably the
league's largest following.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Carolina's history is short and sweet.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes were an original World Hockey Assn. franchise
founded in 1972 and based in Boston as the New England Whalers. The
team later moved to Springfield, Mass., then became the Hartford
Whalers when the franchise joined the NHL in 1979. Then in 1997,
owner Peter Karmanos moved the team to North Carolina and changed the
name to the Carolina Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Detroit has won nine Stanley Cups and has reached the
finals 22 times, the Hurricanes have never come close to a
championship.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the franchise's most famous player is Gordie Howe, who
began his NHL career in Detroit in 1946 and finished it with the
Whalers in 1980, at age 52.</TE>
<TE>   But the way Carolina captain Ron Francis sees it, history has to
start somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to have success to earn that respect," said
Francis, who broke into the NHL with Hartford in 1981. "You look back
a short while ago, people used to laugh at the New Jersey franchise
and look where they are today.</TE>
<TE>   "I think as a team and as an organization and our city that we
want to continue to make steps in the right direction and I think
we're starting to do that the last couple of years, and certainly the
more success we have, the more respect we'll get. So it's up to us to
go out there and play as hard as we can and try to generate more
success."</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes understand that pulling off an upset will be easier
said than done.</TE>
<TE>   They have not won in Detroit since the 1989-90 season, when they
were still the Whalers. They are 4-16 against the Red Wings in the
last 10 years, including two losses this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes finished the regular season with 91 points--good
enough to win the Southeast Division but not good enough to even
qualify for the playoffs had they been in the Western Conference.
They know that the best way to get the respect they desire is to
upset Detroit, which had the league's best record and 25 more points
than Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be winners and respect comes from winning, so it all
ties together, one way or another," said Carolina goaltender Arturs
Irbe, who has a playoff-best 1.41 goals-against average and a .927
save percentage. "Win, and then everything else will come."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina begins Game 1 tonight a much different team than the one
the Red Wings faced twice before Thanksgiving. The Hurricanes can
play defense and their confidence is high after rolling through the
Eastern Conference with playoff wins over New Jersey, Montreal and
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point for the Hurricanes came when they traded
defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "Ozolinsh was like a riverboat gambler who was more of an
end-to-end rusher," said Detroit winger Brendan Shanahan, who played
for Hartford early in his career. "Then they brought in Sean Hill,
who is an effective offensive player and pretty steady defensive man
as well, and [Bret] Hedican, who is a solid, reliable defenseman.
That just settled things down for them and that's why you saw a lot
of low-scoring games. It hasn't just been their goaltending."</TE>
<TE>   But Carolina will face a much tougher offense in the Red Wings,
who have a lineup boiling over with goal scorers.</TE>
<TE>   With a majority of players remaining from the Stanley Cup
championship teams of 1997 and 1998, Detroit does not have a problem
scoring. Just ask Colorado, which was blitzed, 7-0, Friday in the
most lopsided Game 7 in NHL history.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings have depth and balance with four interchangeable
lines. Steve Yzerman, Brendan Shanahan, Sergei Fedorov, Brett Hull,
Luc Robitaille, the list of scorers goes on and on. Darren McCarty,
who often skates on the fourth line, scored four goals against the
Avalanche in the Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Red Wings are a puck possession team and if you are in the
wrong position all of the time, they are just going to pass it around
and have the puck all night," Carolina forward Jeff O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   For Carolina to make this a competitive series, Irbe is going to
have to consistently make big saves. Given a chance to win his job
back after being replaced by Kevin Weekes early in the playoffs, Irbe
has been a rock.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes are hoping that Irbe has the same effectiveness
against Detroit that he had in 1994 playing for San Jose. Irbe was
magnificent in leading the Sharks to a shocking seven-game,
first-round win over the Red Wings, who finished with the most points
in the conference that season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a competitive nature and we want to win," Irbe said. "We
want to show that we can battle and win the ultimate prize."</TE>

Carolina Hurricanes  vs. Detroit Red Wings
Carolina facts: 35-26-16-5, Eastern Conference champion, seeded No. 3
Detroit facts: 51-17-10-4, Western Conference champion, seeded No. 1
Head to head: Detroit 2-0
Series preview: Goaltender Dominik Hasek, winger Luc Robitaille and
defenseman Steve Duchesne are three Red Wings who have never played
on a championship team. Their enthusiasm and the leadership of
captain Steve Yzerman and Chris Chelios have been the driving force
behind Detroit's playoff run. Throw in proven players such as Brendan
Shanahan, Brett Hull, Sergei Fedorov, Tomas Holmstrom, Darren McCarty
and Igor Larionov and the Red Wings look unbeatable. But Carolina has
relished in an underdog role throughout the playoffs. Coach Paul
Maurice has got his players working together and the Hurricanes'
suffocating defense has already frustrated New Jersey, Montreal and
Toronto in the playoffs
What Detroit needs to do to win: Listen to everything Coach Scotty
Bowman says because when it comes to winning Stanley Cups, he's the
master. Bowman has won eight NHL championships as a coach and one as
a general manager. His Red Wings dominated the league during the
season, but they've been tested in the playoffs. The Red Wings will
pressure the Hurricanes all over the ice and have to make the most
out of their power-play opportunities. Shanahan, Robitaille and Hull
can't afford to go through any more mini-slumps
What Carolina needs to do to win: The Hurricanes can't allow Detroit
to score first. They may be able to still win if both teams have a
difficult time scoring, but the Hurricanes don't have enough offense
to come from behind against the Red Wings. Sami Kapanen and Jeff
O'Neill have to produce offensively every night. Detroit is too good
to rely on one scoring line, plus the Hurricanes' BBC line of Bates
Battaglia, Rod Brind'Amour and Erik Cole were shut down pretty well
by Toronto in the Eastern Conference Finals. Goaltender Arturs Irbe
can't give up any easy goals. He has to be sharp at all times and
expect the Red Wings to launch a ton of shots at him
Key injuries: DET: C Steve Yzerman (knee, day to day). Goaltender's
postseason record: DET: Dominik Hasek (12-6). CAR: Arturs Irbe (9-4),
Kevin Weekes (3-2)</TE>

Prediction: Carolina has to have
a lot of things go right in order
to have a chance to win the
series. There's a big difference
between shutting down the
offenses of New Jersey, Montreal
and Toronto, compared to the Red
Wings. The Hurricanes may be able
to punish the Red Wings down low
but they have to be able to keep
the puck to do it. Detroit's
ability to score in transition
will be a concern for the
Hurricanes, who will have enough
problems dealing with Hasek.

<LD>Curt Schilling, showing no effects from a high fever, gave up three
hits in seven innings to become baseball's first 11-game winner as
the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Houston Astros, 10-4, Monday night
at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (11-1), who had a 104-degree fever Sunday night, gave up
one run, struck out eight and walked none. He has not issued a walk
in his last five starts, a string of 37 innings and 138 batters, and
has 131 strikeouts and eight walks this season.</LD>
<LD>   Counting the postseason, Schilling improved to 22-1 in starts
following an Arizona loss.</LD>
<TE>   Arizona's offense broke loose after sputtering on a seven-game
trip.</TE>
<TE>   Erubiel Durazo ended an 0-for-21 drought with a two-run homer, his
sixth homer since coming off the disabled list May 15. Jose Guillen
drove in two with a bases-loaded single and Junior Spivey tripled in
two more.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Paul Lessard said Schilling had been treated for strep
throat since Sunday, although he hadn't been tested for it. Schilling
gave up a run-scoring double to Geoff Blum in the fifth and retired
the next eight batters before leaving with a nine-run lead.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 7, Chicago 6--Paul Bako and Lenny Harris hit consecutive
homers to start a five-run seventh inning at Milwaukee and the
Brewers overcame Sammy Sosa's 20th home run.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers trailed, 5-1, in the fifth after Jamey Wright gave up
four home runs, two to Fred McGriff.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' third career pinch-hit homer pulled the Brewers within
5-4. Jeffrey Hammonds had a run-scoring single and Richie Sexson had
a two-run double to put Milwaukee ahead, 6-5.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, New York 4--Vinny Castilla hit a grand slam in the
first inning at Atlanta and Andruw Jones hit a tiebreaking homer
against Steve Trachsel (3-6) in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves extended their division lead to a season-high two
games, winning for the seventh time in nine games. The second-place
Mets lost their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 7, Pittsburgh 5--Troy O'Leary hit a two-run triple at
Montreal, and the Expos took advantage of sloppy defense by the
Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos scored three unearned runs in the fifth, aided by two
errors, including first baseman Kevin Young's throwing error on Jose
Vidro's two-out grounder that allowed Orlando Cabrera to score from
third to end a 3-3 tie.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 11, San Diego 3--Benito Santiago and Marvin Benard
hit three-run homers at San Diego, and the Giants won for only the
fourth time in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago's homer highlighted a six-run third inning. Tsuyoshi
Shinjo homered leading off the five-run eighth, and Benard hit a
homer three batters later. Jeff Kent had a run-scoring double and
finished with three hits.</TE>
<TE>   Benard, a late fill-in for injured outfielder Reggie Sanders, also
had two doubles.</TE>

<LD>Dr. Jack Ramsay, ESPN radio announcer and a respected former NBA
coach, can visualize a defense the New Jersey Nets could use against
Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   It involves the zone the Nets employed so well against the Boston
Celtics, the zone that shut down Paul Pierce--the player who had
boldly predicted the Nets had no one who could stop him--in two
crucial fourth quarters.</LD>
<LD>   It involves fronting and backing O'Neal. It involves 7-foot,
280-pound Todd MacCulloch pushing relentlessly against the Laker
center, and then Aaron Williams, an active player with good
medium-range shooting ability, spelling MacCulloch and making O'Neal
play defense.</LD>
<TE>   And it all sounds very nice. But then Dr. Jack has to pause a
moment and add something else.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the last two games," Ramsay says, "it's the best I've
ever seen Shaq play. He played very much under control. He took what
the defense gave him. When he was blocked in the middle, he went
baseline. He shot the fadeaway jump shot. And he's such a good
passer. I thought he was terrific and right now, it's hard to doubt
him."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Croce, who last year was president of the Philadelphia 76ers,
the East team that lost to the Lakers in the Finals, is now working
for NBC. Croce watched the Nets beat the Celtics in the Eastern
Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   Croce says: "I love to watch the Nets play. I love the way they
play, the way they always make the extra pass. They are a team in the
true sense, and they will need to rely on teamwork even more so
against the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   Croce, the eternal champion of the underdog, then becomes silent,
an unusual circumstance for Croce--silence--when asked to construct a
way the Nets might stop O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "At first glance," Croce finally says, "it looks impossible.
Shaq's playing better than ever. He's making these moves a man 100
pounds smaller makes. He fakes right, twists left. How does he do
that? His hook has a little more extension than even last year. You
can see Shaq still has the passion, and now he's increased the skill
level."</TE>
<TE>   So Croce's suggestion on how the Nets stop O'Neal? "People who
believe the impossible is possible," Croce says, "accomplish special
things." This is not the game plan Coach Byron Scott wants to hand
his Nets. "Believe the impossible is possible." But it might be his
best hope against O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   It is the one spot where the Nets seem hopelessly overmatched.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsay says the Nets will have to overplay O'Neal when he's coming
to the ball. "Of course, that's not anything the Lakers haven't seen
before," Ramsay says. "The Nets have been doing a good job with their
defense, though, and I'm assuming they'll continue to do a good job
with it.</TE>
<TE>   "MacCulloch has a big body. He's not easy to push around. And
MacCulloch has great hands. He won't miss shots around the basket.
When Williams come in, the Nets will run a lot of high screen and
rolls to involve Shaq. Williams has some quickness about him, he
finishes well at the basket, he can make that 15-, 17-foot jump shot,
and he's a good free-throw shooter.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq became much more active defensively in Game 7 on screen
plays. He stepped out instead of lagging in back. When he just lays
off the play, he makes it very hard for his teammate who is
defending. So if Shaq doesn't stay active defensively, that helps the
Nets."</TE>
<TE>   Don't think that Ramsay is a total Laker backer either.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't read them," Ramsay says of the Lakers. "They're a
puzzling team. When they absolutely have to do it, they get it done.
Until then, they're often on cruise control and that could be
dangerous against the Nets. The Nets might have to win a game to get
the Lakers to play."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsay had picked the Nets to beat the Celtics, even though the
Celtics are coached by his son-in-law, Jim O'Brien. The 77-year-old
who coached in Philadelphia, Buffalo, Portland and Indiana and won an
NBA title at Portland, likes many things about the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason Kidd is a great player and he makes all those guys around
him better," Ramsay says. "[Kerry] Kittles and [Keith] Van Horn seem
to have found their shots and their confidence. The Nets really
played exceptionally well against the Celtics. It actually surprised
me how well they played against the Celtics. They've come up with big
plays at the right times like the Lakers have. They are playing with
confidence and come into this series with that old 'everything to
gain, nothing to lose' attitude. Nobody gives them a chance and
that's significant. They can just go out and play their butts off."</TE>
<TE>   All that said, Ramsay has to speak about O'Neal again. While
comparing O'Neal to Wilt Chamberlain, Ramsay says, "Shaq is quicker,
more agile, has a more complete offensive game. Wilt was a great
passer, but I think Shaq is his equal there."</TE>
<TE>   As to whether the Nets can guard this quick, agile, active,
great-passing, high-scoring O'Neal, Ramsay says, "I can't visualize
it."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets not only have to visualize it, they have to do it. And if
they do, it would be, as Croce says, "making the impossible
possible." Because the O'Neal of Games 6 and 7 against Sacramento is
a Jason Kidd who is 7-1 and 320 pounds, an active, agile, mentally
tough, physically unbeatable athlete whose only thought is not
losing.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Deliver in the Ratings</HD>
<DH>Television: Game 7 victory outdraws even the Super Bowl in
L.A. and becomes one of the highest rated for team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers are bigger in Los Angeles than the Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Their 112-106 victory over Sacramento in Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals on Sunday drew a 36.9 L.A. rating, which translates
to nearly 5 million viewers in this market.</LD>
<LD>   This year's Super Bowl, in which the New England Patriots upset
the St. Louis Rams, 20-17, on Feb. 3, got a 36.4 L.A. rating.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday's Laker game had a 60 share. The Super Bowl, because of an
earlier start time, had a 61 share.</TE>
<TE>   The 60 share may be an all-time Laker record, at least the highest
in more than two decades. Keith Harris, the Lakers' executive
director of multimedia marketing, could not find a higher share in
his records.</TE>
<TE>   And the 36.9 rating was the second-highest for a Laker telecast in
L.A., according to Harris' records. The only higher rating was a 39.2
for Game 6 of the 2000 NBA Finals, in which the Lakers beat the
Indiana Pacers in six games.</TE>
<TE>   The next highest rating after the 36.9 for Sunday's game is a 35.7
for Game 5 of the 2001 NBA Finals, in which the Lakers beat the
Philadelphia 76ers in five games.</TE>
<TE>   The share for that game was a 58, and the share for Game 6 in 2000
was a 56. Shares are generally lower later in the evening, when more
people are watching television, and those games started at 6 p.m., as
opposed to Sunday's 4:30 start.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Game 7 Sunday drew an overnight rating of 16.9 with a
27 share. Those are the highest overnight numbers for the non-NBA
Finals in four years and also represent a 66% increase over the
10.2/16 overnight numbers for Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals
between Philadelphia and Milwaukee last year.</TE>
<TE>   The last time a non-NBA Finals game got higher overnight numbers
was in 1998, when Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals between
Chicago and Indiana drew a 20.7/34.</TE>
<TE>   During the fourth quarter and overtime on Sunday, the numbers
peaked at 23.2/34.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight ratings are obtained from the nation's 53 largest
markets, covering 65% of the population. National ratings for
Sunday's game won't be available until today.</TE>
<TE>   A rating represents the percentage of all television households
tuned into a particular program, and the share is the percentage of
households where television is being watched.</TE>
<TE>   So Sunday's game, according to Nielsen, was watched in 36.9% of
all TV households in the L.A. market and 60% of those where
television was being watched.</TE>
<TE>   Since each rating point represents 53,542 homes in L.A., Sunday's
game was watched in nearly 2 million homes.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated 5 million viewers comes from figuring that there are
an average of 2 1/2 viewers per household.</TE>

<HD>Reform Looms After ISU Vote</HD>
<DH>Skating: ISU Congress approves idea that major changes are
still needed for judging and scoring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KYOTO, Japan</DL>
<LD>Ottavio Cinquanta left no doubt who's running figure skating--or that
he believes the time has passed for cronyism and outdated rules.</LD>
<LD>   An International Skating Union proposal for major reform of the
sport's judging and scoring, pushed vigorously by Cinquanta, was
approved, 81-16, with seven abstentions at the ISU Congress Monday
evening here. However, Cinquanta said the concept of reform was
ratified, not the specific provisions of the initiative, and said
other "urgent proposals" for reform will be discussed when figure
skating officials meet Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a good result for the ISU because now we have opened
another door," he said. "We have a certain variety.... We are in the
middle of a crisis and we are responsible to find a solution, because
the situation is grave."</LD>
<TE>   Cinquanta repeatedly described the ISU proposal--first outlined
during the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics--as a project that is
perhaps 70% complete and requires testing and study. Its
implementation hinges on another vote of the Congress. Cinquanta said
it could be used at an "important" competition in the 2003-04 season,
such as a Grand Prix event.</TE>
<TE>   The session had some contentious moments, most notably when
Cinquanta scolded Sally Anne Stapleford of Great Britain, chair of
the powerful technical committee and part of the sport's old guard,
for not actively helping repair the ISU's tarnished image after the
pairs judging scandal at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   When Stapleford asked whether a vote for the proposal constituted
approval of it as written or an approval of general reform, Cinquanta
accused her of abandoning the ISU while it scrambled to regain its
equilibrium at the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "We were waiting in Salt Lake City for your contribution. You
disappeared," he said. "You left the [ISU] council alone. The council
has a lot of people. We hoped to be escorted by you because you are
very active, but you disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   Stapleford was stunned by the barrage.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was inappropriate," she said. "I did say I was rather
surprised at his reaction and said I was trying to help him out in
what's going to be a rather difficult situation and get the project
researched.... The first I heard of the project was in Salt Lake. I
wasn't asked for any input."</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta clearly was intent on getting his way, ensuring the ISU
proposal was discussed on the first day and by the full Congress. The
group will split into speedskating and figure skating sections
Wednesday to discuss rules pertaining to each sport.</TE>
<TE>   It is in those meetings that the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. will
push its reforms, which are less radical than the ISU's and could be
more quickly implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Like the ISU, the USFSA proposes calculating skaters' placements
through random computer selection of scores from a panel of judges.
The USFSA would keep the 6.0 perfect score and rank skaters by their
median marks. The ISU advocates dropping the perfect 6.0 score and
determining placements by cumulative points based on the value of
jumps or spins. The U.S. modifications could be in effect while the
ISU system is being tested, with a final decision made at a future
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. delegation felt bowled over by Cinquanta and was
concerned its proposal and an Australian plan would be ignored.
Nonetheless, the U.S. cast its two votes for the ISU proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "I can support change. It's what's in the details and how much of
the details that would be used in the future. That's what makes me
nervous," said John LeFevre, executive director of the USFSA. "At
least we wanted to make sure our proposal would be heard in the
figure skating section. I think we have a lot of support."</TE>
<TE>   The USFSA lost a minor battle when its proposal mandating a
lifetime ban for any skater, ISU official, judge, referee or
federation official found guilty of an ethical violation was faulted
by Cinquanta as too vague.</TE>
<TE>   After he said an ethics commission would be formed to define
violations, the USFSA withdrew the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   USFSA President Phyllis Howard agreed the proposal was too broad
but said it was put forth to get the organization on the record as
taking a moral stand.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Congress rejected a Canadian proposal that would have
prohibited federation presidents from serving as referees or judges.
New Zealand and Yugoslavia opposed it, saying it would have penalized
small countries that don't have enough knowledgeable officials to
separate the two roles.</TE>

<LD>She stood at the halfcourt line in her black and red sweatsuit, the
outfit of her new team, flanked by Spark President Johnny Buss and
Spark General Manager Penny Toler who was holding the wooden box with
the platinum reward.</LD>
<LD>   It was a box Ukari Figgs thought she would be receiving with her
then-Spark teammates at the team's May 25 season opener.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Figgs got her 2001 WNBA championship ring Monday, as a
member of the Portland Fire, before an 89-72 loss to her former L.A.
teammates at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   The Sparks had traded her to Portland for the rights to Nikki
Teasley, who is now starting in Figgs' former spot.</TE>
<TE>   One could imagine the thoughts going through Figgs' mind as she
received a standing ovation from the crowd of 8,567 and a group hug
from the Sparks, including former teammate and best friend Tamecka
Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great moment," Figgs said. "The fans were great, the
players were great; they almost made me very emotional. I feel
honored that they had that kind of respect for me and for what I did
here."</TE>
<TE>   It probably would have meant more to Figgs if she could have been
part of the game, but she was advised not to play after losing her
front tooth in a collision during Sunday's game with teammate Jackie
Stiles.</TE>
<TE>   Stiles, who has been slowed by bursitis in her right foot, sat out
Monday's game, remaining on the bench with a soft cast.</TE>
<TE>   After a slow start the Sparks (4-1) had their way with the Fire,
which came into the game without Figgs and Stiles, and left with
their fourth loss in as many games.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks extended their regular-season home winning streak to 24
games.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Leslie piled up 25 points and 18 rebounds, and Sophia
Witherspoon, also acquired in the trade that dealt Figgs to Portland,
added 19 off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Tamicha Jackson, Figgs' replacement, had 19 for Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good game for our team," said Spark Coach Michael
Cooper, who got points from each of his players Monday. "Portland is
not the type of team that their record shows. They're better than
that. We need to make our mark early, to get a lead on some of these
teams that are trying to get their chemistry and cohesiveness
together."</TE>
<TE>   The pregame presentation and display of affection by her former
team helped the night go by for Figgs who said she was getting more
dental work done today and Wednesday and "could not withstand any
more trauma to the mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said she had to see Figgs in the Fire uniform to let go of
the emotions she has had since the draft-day trade. "I just needed to
know she's OK with everything," Dixon said. "When I talked with her
she was upbeat about the deal, which made me feel a little more at
ease with the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon also was facing her former teammates, but said the
revenge motive wasn't a factor, just as it wasn't when she played
against New York, her first WNBA team, in L.A.'s season opener.</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of know what you can do against teams you've played with
before, but I just want to play my game. There's no extra incentive.
It was their decision to trade me. It's part of the business, and you
know that."</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 67, Houston 52--Andrea Stinson, playing on a sprained
ankle she injured in the season opener against the Sparks, scored 23
points to lead the Sting (2-0) at Charlotte, N.C. Dawn Staley added
14 points and seven assists for the Sting, which caught a break when
Houston (2-2) forward Tina Thompson got into early foul trouble and
was limited to 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 71, Washington 65--Adrain Williams scored 13 points and
grabbed a career-high 11 rebounds to lead the Mercury (2-1) at
Phoenix. Mystic rookie Stacey Dales-Schuman scored 15 points for
Washington (1-1), which played without Chamique Holdsclaw, who did
not accompany the team on the trip west after the death of her
grandmother.</TE>

<DH>The Stanley Cup has been around the world, left by the
road, and held food for a dog. That's why it's so cherished.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Babies have been christened in this silver chalice that grown men
with sticks fight to possess.</LD>
<LD>   Traditional ethnic meals have been served from it.</LD>
<LD>   Animals--real ones, not just NHL team enforcers--have eaten from
it.</LD>
<TE>   It has been stolen by disgruntled Montreal fans, and bounced off
the edge of a swimming pool. It has been to a mountaintop and it has
traveled to Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Australia and Japan.
It drew larger crowds than Lenin's tomb during a visit to Red Square.</TE>
<TE>   It has gone fishing, and has been to a strip club--at least once.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanley Cup, hockey's equivalent of the Holy Grail, has
traveled and been used for more things than its donor, Lord Frederick
Arthur Stanley of Preston, England, the governor-general of Canada
from 1888 to 1893, ever dreamed of.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-time champion Detroit Red Wings and the upstart Carolina
Hurricanes begin the Stanley Cup finals tonight in their crusade to
take home what is perhaps the most hallowed trophy in sports, and
certainly the most colorful.</TE>
<TE>   At 110 years, the Stanley Cup is the oldest professional sports
award, but that cache is secondary to the symbolism embodied in the
silver bowl that stands on a nearly three-foot base that was added in
the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   It's the only professional sports trophy awarded to those who
actually do the work.</TE>
<TE>   The winners of the Super Bowl and World Series may have rings to
flash. But the team owner is handed the championship trophy in each
of those sports, with new trophies doled out each year.</TE>
<TE>   In hockey, the players who earn the Stanley Cup get the Stanley
Cup. The trophy is returned to NHL officials each October and is
presented to the new champion. After victory, etiquette calls for the
cup to be handed first to the winning team's captain, who
traditionally circles the ice with the cup hoisted high for fans to
see.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the trophy will be etched with the names of every winning
player. What follows is a tradition that sets the Stanley Cup apart
from all other honors in professional sports:</TE>
<TE>   Each player from the winning team gets to spend a day with the
Stanley Cup and do with it what he pleases, "within reason."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, "within reason" gets tested.</TE>
<TE>   When Lord Stanley ordered the silver hockey trophy crafted in
1892, he could never have imagined the journeys it would take, or the
antics it would endure.</TE>
<TE>   This cup runneth over with tales of, well ...</TE>
<TE>   Cup of Nourishment</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk to guys about what they want to do with the cup, it
all relates back to how they got to where they are today," said Phil
Pritchard, director of hockey operations and curator at the Hockey
Hall of Fame in Toronto, which assigns one of its members to
accompany the cup at all times. "Whether it was a defining moment in
their youth or something that is important in their life. It's
usually something personal."</TE>
<TE>   Brent Severyn of the Dallas Stars planned for years what he would
do. When the Stars won in 1998-99, Severyn took the cup to
Vegreville, Alberta, a town of 5,000 founded by Ukrainian immigrants.
There, his grandmother made pirogi, mashed-potato-filled turnovers
that were served from the cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever my parents came to visit me ... they always brought me
pirogies," Severyn said. "They knew it was my favorite food. I
thought it was fitting to have them from the cup."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some meals have not been deemed fitting for the king of
cups. The New York Islanders' Charlie Gillies caused a furor in the
1980s when he allowed his dog to eat out of it. Times do change,
though. In 1994, no one seemed to mind when the New York Rangers'
Eddie Olczyk let a racehorse eat out of it.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, players use the cup to celebrate with those who
supported them along the way to victory, or take it to a cherished
spot.</TE>
<TE>   When New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur had his turn in 2000, the
goalie took the cup home to Montreal, blocked off neighborhood
streets and held a hockey tournament. The winners held the cup for an
hour. That evening, Brodeur took his children, and the cup, to the
movies, where they all ate popcorn from its bowl.</TE>
<TE>   His teammate, Scott Niedermayer, haggled with the NHL to take the
cup to the top of British Columbia's Fischer Peak--9,300 feet above
sea level. The league relented, and Niedermayer took a helicopter to
the top and spent half an hour there, posing for photos with the cup.</TE>
<TE>   "From Cranbrook, where I live, it's the landmark you can see from
town," Niedermayer later explained.</TE>
<TE>   Cup of Mischief</TE>
<TE>   Lord Stanley paid 10 guineas--$48.67 in Canadian dollars at the
time--to have the 16-kilogram trophy made by silversmiths in England,
either Sheffield or London; where, exactly, isn't clear. He wanted to
help fuel the growing sport of hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "I have, for some time, been thinking it would be a good thing if
there were a challenge cup, which should be held, from year to year,
by the champion hockey club of the Dominion," Stanley wrote in letter
to an aide in 1892.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the trophy was for amateur hockey teams, and each year
the winning team could use it to challenge a competitor. As the sport
grew and professional leagues sprouted, the amateurs were pushed out.
The NHL took possession of the cup in 1926 and has controlled it ever
since.</TE>
<TE>   Players were officially allowed to have "A Day With the Cup"
beginning in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   But there were many unofficial "days" before that.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1924, Montreal Canadien players of questionable
sobriety "borrowed" the cup, then left it on the side of the road
when their car broke down on the way to a victory party.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, Montreal's Guy Lafleur noticed the cup while leaving the
old Montreal Forum one day, and took it home.</TE>
<TE>   There are tales of a drunken celebration lasting through the
night, ending with the cup being dropped into Ottawa's Rideau Canal
in the 1920s. In 1962, a Canadien fan, unhappy that his team was
losing in the semifinals to the defending champion Chicago
Blackhawks, stole the cup from its display case in Chicago Stadium,
although he didn't get out of the building with it. Montreal fans
struck again in the 1970s, this time swiping the cup from the Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   New York center Mark Messier took the cup to a strip club after
the Rangers won in 1994. Such things are now prohibited under the
"within reason" clause.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what makes it so special is the history of it," Mighty
Duck captain Paul Kariya said. "It's obviously such a prized
possession, but at the same time it's treated like ... uh ...
haphazardly."</TE>
<TE>   Dents are common and a new one appeared on the base in 1999. One
version of the story has Dallas players celebrating with Pantera, the
heavy metal band that wrote and performed the team's theme song. They
were taking turns throwing the cup into a pool, and one player
missed. Ding!</TE>
<TE>   Another version has a Star jumping from a rooftop into the pool
while the band played. The player made a big splash. The cup made a
sickening sound. Clang!</TE>
<TE>   Only the Stars know for sure and they're not talking.</TE>
<TE>   That, though, is the beauty of the Stanley Cup. The stories, real
or exaggerated, make the legend grow.</TE>
<TE>   Cup of Destiny</TE>
<TE>   Many players who crave the cup refuse to touch it, since legend
has it that if you touch the cup before you earn it, you'll never
touch it in victory.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, when New Jersey won the cup, the Devils' Shawn Chambers
wanted to share his day with Dallas' Derian Hatcher. They had grown
up together in Sterling Heights, Mich., playing hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher refused.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I would have my day," Hatcher said. "You only drink
from the cup when you have earned the right."</TE>
<TE>   The Stanley Cup is commonly called "the People's Cup," because on
any given day, anyone can find himself within arm's reach of it.
While other professional sports trophies sit in protective trophy
cases, the Stanley Cup travels more than 300 days a year, from hockey
exhibitions to minor league charity games. Fans wait in line for
hours to catch a glimpse, pose for photos with it, run their fingers
over it.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing better illustrates the reverence with which hockey's
greatest prize is held than that it can drive a man from drink.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Watt and Doug Risebrough were assistant coaches with Calgary
during the 1988-89 season. They logged miles, running together
mornings. They gave up alcohol for Lent together.</TE>
<TE>   "Lent was over the last weekend of the season," said Watt, now an
assistant with the Mighty Ducks. "I said to Riser, 'So, are you going
to have beer after the game?' He said, 'No I'm not ... the next drink
I take is going to be out the Stanley Cup.'"</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, on a charter flight from Montreal, amid a
delirious celebration by players, coaches, their families and
friends, Risebrough drank the fruits--specifically fermented
grapes--of victory.</TE>
<TE>   Winning the cup takes blood, sweat and tears.</TE>
<TE>   A team must endure an exhausting 82-game regular season, then
survive four rounds in the playoffs. The team keeps the cup until the
beginning of the next season, then returns it to the Hall of Fame. A
smaller copy is given to the team.</TE>
<TE>   The original bowl, worn and brittle, was replicated in the 1960s
and now rests in peace in a vault. Every 13 years, the oldest
remaining ring is removed from the base and a blank one put in its
place to keep the cup from growing to an unmanageable height. The
rings--upon which the players' names are engraved--then remain on
display at the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "That started on the 100th anniversary of the cup," said
Pritchard. "[Former New York Islander] Bryan Trottier once said the
cup was 36 inches tall and that's the perfect height to hold over
your head, so don't mess with it."</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, officials have to mess with it to correct a
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   King forward Adam Deadmarsh was surprised to find he had been
renamed when he first saw the cup after helping the Colorado
Avalanche win in 1995-96. He appeared as "Deadmarch" and became the
first player in cup history to have his name corrected. All previous
mistakes had been crossed out and rewritten. Still, it didn't mar his
day with the trophy, spent in his hometown of Fruitvale, British
Columbia, just north of the Washington border near Spokane.</TE>
<TE>   "I had it at the local arena for three or four hours so everyone
could get their picture taken with it," Deadmarsh said. "After that,
we had a big dinner and then I took it to a bar."</TE>
<TE>   The Stanley Cup is the only sports trophy that can boast of not
one but two television commercials to its credit, and is the only
sports trophy to have such a leading role.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Express used it tongue in cheek as an example of what
could happen if you trusted another shipping company. The cup ended
up in South America. A bag of coffee beans arrived at the arena.</TE>
<TE>   The cup has also been in a MasterCard commercial. Pritchard is the
co-star as they trace a day with the cup. The cup is insured for $1.6
million, but Pritchard said that's as high as any insurance company
would go. After all, he said he agrees with the commercial
voice-over--the cup is "priceless."</TE>
<TE>   Although the cup is one of the most recognized symbols in sports,
its not known to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "We took it Reno one time and this lady comes up to me and asked
where the cups were," Pritchard said. "I said, 'Excuse me, I don't
understand.' She said, 'Isn't that a coffee urn?' So I guess it's not
known by everybody."</TE>
<TE>   But the cup is known by enough.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Joey Kocur took the cup home to Kelvington,
Saskatchewan, a town of 900, in 1998. A crowd of 30,000 was waiting.</TE>
<TE>   On his day with the cup, Colorado's Rob Blake took it to Simcoe,
Ontario, 90 miles southwest of Toronto. He had a little get-together
with 1,500 of his closest friends. The next day, they held a parade
and 15,000 showed up.</TE>
<TE>   The cup's most historical moment might have occurred in 1997,
which underscored its worldwide popularity. Detroit's Viacheslav
Fetisov, Vyacheslav Kozlov and Igor Larionov took the cup to Russia
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "We had millions of fans who rooted for [the Red Wings] all the
way," Larionov told a crowd of 62,000, which included Boris Yeltsin,
at a Moscow soccer stadium. "It would be unfair not to bring this cup
and show it to them."</TE>
<TE>   In a country where hockey is politics, hoisting the cup in Red
Square, brought home by Russian players, was a moment of national
pride.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a state event," Pritchard said. "About 20,000-30,000
people a day came to see the cup. It was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   But then so is the cup.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times where I'll be coaching a team that is going
through tough times," Watt said. "But every now and then it'll come
back to me, 'Yeah, I won the Stanley Cup.' It hits you and you
smile."</TE>

<HD>Jackson Should Be Billed for This Laker Victory</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's one thing to have sports columnist Bill Plaschke criticize Laker
Coach Phil Jackson, and quite another to have Red Auerbach take aim.</LD>
<LD>   Let's face it, Auerbach has no idea what he's talking about.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   PLASCHKE, HOWEVER, is an award-winning columnist. At least that's
what he tells me, and I don't think he'd make something like that up.</TE>
<TE>   Under the headline: "If They Lose, Jackson Could End Up Taking It
on the Chin," Plaschke delivered a stirring epistle last Friday. He
wrote that Shaq and Kobe might stop listening to Phil if the Kings
went on to win Game 6, and suggested nobody had more to lose than
Phil if the Lakers fell to Sacramento that night.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of pressure--having Plaschke on your back and
possibly writing you out of the NBA history books with one loss--so I
watched Phil closely to see how he might react. I also watched
Jeanie, because that's just an old habit of mine.</TE>
<TE>   Right away I noticed Phil talking more to Shaq and Kobe,
undoubtedly concerned this might be the last night of his life. I was
impressed. I figured some people read Plaschke, but never for a
second did I think anyone agreed with what he wrote, and here was
Phil trying to impress him. For all I know, I might be wrong about
columnist Diane Pucin, too.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Phil waved his arms like he was coaching. I asked a
Laker PR guy if he was going to put out a press release: "For the
first time all year, the team would like to announce Jackson was seen
doing something," but he was speechless.</TE>
<TE>   Laker owner Jerry Buss said after the game, "I've never seen
anything like that," and he might have been talking about the team's
win, but I'm sure it could also have been said about the way Phil was
working the game.</TE>
<TE>   I watched the referees, and I could tell they had sympathy for
Phil, and Plaschke's columns, of course, are known for inspiring
sympathy, and so the referees seemed to make every call in favor of
the Lakers. That had the Kings crying, another by-product of most
Plaschke columns.</TE>
<TE>   After the Laker win Friday night I expected local TV stations to
talk to Plaschke about getting the best out of Phil. I know Plaschke
used to be on TV in an Ed McMahon-like role, so this would've been a
big break.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least I expected Fox Sports Net's Jack Haley to hug
him like he does all the Laker players after a win.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I DON'T know who had the bigger comeback: The Lakers or Plaschke?
There is no question Plaschke felt threatened by new columnist Rick
Majerus, but like most great competitors, he responded like a pro,
correctly pegging the Zen Master as the key to the series, while
Majerus shifted his attention to Laker Boy.</TE>
<TE>   Plaschke had Jackson on top of his game Sunday, too. Jackson told
his players to meditate for 15 minutes, presumably telling them it
was either that or they would have to read Plaschke's column from top
to bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was sweating, he was coaching so much, and I don't think
anyone in L.A. has ever seen Jackson work up a sweat. The TV cameras
caught him yelling at several players, and I wasn't sure he knew all
their names. He was taking timeouts like he was really coaching. Phil
was meeting the Plaschke challenge, and then and there I vowed to
read Plaschke more often.</TE>
<TE>   I even found myself defending Plaschke on the telephone Monday to
some guy named "Alan" who was calling to trash him for not being a
bigger Laker cheerleader. I told him, "it's just too bad Haley
doesn't have a column.... ''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I THINK it would be a nice gesture if Phil invited Plaschke to
ride with him in the victory parade after the Nets are dispatched.
After all, it was Plaschke who got Phil to coach in the team's two
biggest games and saved Phil's standing in the basketball world. You
could say Plaschke did as much for Phil as Michael Jordan, Scottie
Pippen, Shaq and Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   For my part, I've made the commitment now to not make fun of
Plaschke any more. I plan to begin in earnest tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I JUST got this e-mail, and I don't know what to make of it.</TE>
<TE>   Raffi Minasian wrote to say he was afraid to e-mail until after
Game 7. He said he remembers when Lisa Leslie made 40 or 50 straight
free throws and I told her, "jinx,'' and then in the following game
she missed her first free throw.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to tell you this, you print it and then jinx the
Lakers," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "I recall you giving Phil a hard time about not wanting to coach
the All-Star game so he could spend a weekend with Jeanie."</TE>
<TE>   Phil has a pretty good track record for setting goals, and
reaching them.</TE>
<TE>   Minasian said he and a friend ran into Phil and Jeanie in a Palm
Springs' Mexican restaurant on Feb. 7--during the break. They told
Phil the Kings made them nervous, and said, "Whatever you do, don't
let Sacramento get the best record."</TE>
<TE>   "Phil smiled," Minasian recalled, "and told us, 'Actually, we want
them to have the best record, so we can go up there for Game 7 and
break their hearts.'"</TE>
<TE>   He's not that good--is he? If he is, then what Plaschke wrote made
no difference, and he might as well have written about Laker Boy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Ralph:</TE>

<HD>Reyna, Mathis Could Be Out</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Key midfielder and forward might miss Portugal game
because of lingering injuries</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>In the unlikely event that Antonio Oliveira has had trouble sleeping
lately because of concern over what sort of World Cup threat the
United States will pose, Portugal's coach can rest easy now.</LD>
<LD>   There is an excellent chance that the 11 American players who will
take the field Wednesday night in the Seoul suburb of Suwon will
never have played together as a team.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, never.</LD>
<TE>   Last-minute injuries could rob the U.S. of two players who were
being counted on heavily: Claudio Reyna to set up the goals and Clint
Mathis to score them.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, Reyna said he considered his chances of
playing "no better than 50-50" because of a strained right thigh
muscle. That pessimistic assessment raised Coach Bruce Arena's
eyebrows an inch or so when he heard Reyna's honest answer.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis, meanwhile, practiced only briefly Monday before being
carted off for an MRI on his left knee, which is causing him
discomfort. The striker tore the anterior cruciate ligament in the
same knee several years ago, just as he'd torn the right ACL exactly
a year ago on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's scan proved negative, Arena said, but Mathis still is
considered a questionable starter.</TE>
<TE>   Arena came here without a clear-cut and experienced replacement
for injured Chris Armas in defensive midfield, and his outside backs,
Tony Sanneh and David Regis, have inspired little confidence. Now,
the injuries to Reyna and Mathis, and the loss of form of several
other players, could prompt Arena to shuffle players around just to
cover the deficiencies in his lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The possible loss of Reyna for one or more games is especially bad
news.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm upset," Reyna said. "I'd rather not be injured. I'd rather be
doing everything 100%. But that's the reality. I've dealt with it
before. Every team has injured players.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Clint, at the moment, are the guys who are a little bit
banged up The worst-case scenario, I think, would be just missing one
game and being ready for the next two.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have all day today and tomorrow to get treatment, and
hopefully if it responds and if tomorrow night at training I can do
everything to help the team Wednesday, then I'll play.</TE>
<TE>   "But I wouldn't put myself in any danger. I think it wouldn't help
the team if I'm not 100% or even, say, 90%. I think I can only just
damage myself and not really help the team."</TE>
<TE>   Mathis' access to the media was controlled Monday. He was quickly
escorted past reporters in the "mixed zone" area set up at the team's
hotel without being allowed to comment on his injury.</TE>
<TE>   Arena and Reyna gave conflicting answers when asked about Mathis'
status.</TE>
<TE>   "He practiced briefly today," Arena said. "We took a precautionary
MRI and found nothing. So he is fine. He had a little inflammation,
and we just wanted to make sure he was OK. I'm glad to say it went
well, and it is not a concern."</TE>
<TE>   Reyna disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "He and I are really in the same boat, where it's about a 50-50
[chance of playing]," the U.S. team captain said.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis has been touted as the likely breakout player for the U.S.
at the World Cup, the one who would do well enough to secure a move
to a European club. In recent weeks, he has been featured on the
cover of Sports Illustrated and profiled in the New York Times
magazine and TV Guide.</TE>
<TE>   He has also been the only player this year who has been able to
spark the U.S. offense. If he cannot play against Portugal and if
out-of-form Brian McBride is not selected, Arena's forwards on
Wednesday could be Joe-Max Moore and Josh Wolff, or even Landon
Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the speed, power and experience of the Portuguese
attack, concerns on defense are greater for the U.S. than those on
offense.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, central defender Jeff Agoos has trained both in that
position and at left back, in case Arena decides that Regis is not
his starter. Also training at left back, although U.S. spokesmen
declined to confirm it, has been Frankie Hejduk, who normally plays
at right back.</TE>
<TE>   Arena, not wanting to tip his hand on any possible moves,
dismissed that as being the norm, saying that Hejduk plays both sides
of the field on defense the same as Cobi Jones does in midfield.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankie is a good one-on-one defender, with good quickness and
defends very well off the ball," he said. "He is one of our better
defenders. And in terms of one-on-one duels, he does a pretty solid
job."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team is scheduled to hold a closed-door practice at the
Suwon World Cup Stadium on Tuesday night and, a team spokesman said,
it is unlikely anyone will know Arena's starting lineup until an hour
before Wednesday night's game.</TE>
<TE>   By then, miraculous cures could have occurred--the World Cup being
a prime stage for disinformation campaigns--or the American lineup
could have an unfamiliar look.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been so used to injuries that we have rarely played with
our whole starting group over the last three years," Arena said. "One
thing about this team is that we're always prepared to make
adjustments. So in that sense we're comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "Would we like to have Chris Armas here? Yes. Not going to happen.
Would the French like to have had [Zinedine] Zidane in the opening
game? Not going to happen. Would the Brazilians like to have Emerson?
I mean, it's all part of it. It's happening to every team. It's not
just the U.S. team."</TE>
<TE>   And is that troubling to Arena?</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said. "I think I'll sleep pretty well tonight and
tomorrow. I'm confident with our group of players, whomever has to
play."</TE>
<TE>   All the same, Portugal's Oliveira probably is sleeping even
better.</TE>

<HD>USC Lumbers Into Another Super Regional</HD>
<DH>College baseball: Trojan bats come alive in 13-10 victory
over BYU, and they advance for fourth straight year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first two games of the NCAA baseball regional at Dedeaux
Field, USC had survived on clutch pitching and key late-inning hits
to defeat Brigham Young and Cal State Northridge. But the big guys
who had powered the Trojans to a Pacific 10 Conference championship
were largely kept quiet.</LD>
<LD>   Facing a BYU team that had given them fits three days earlier, the
Trojans on Monday needed production from first baseman Bill Peavey
and catcher Alberto Concepcion. They got it, as the two helped charge
a 21-hit attack in a 13-10 victory over the Cougars that advanced USC
to the super regional for the fourth straight year.</LD>
<LD>   USC (37-22) will face Pac-10 rival Stanford in a best-of-three
series in Palo Alto beginning Friday night. It will be the second
time in four years the teams have played each other with a College
World Series berth on the line.</LD>
<TE>   Peavey, who leads the team in home runs and runs batted in, had
only two hits and had not driven in a run in the first two games of
the regional. Concepcion, the conference player of the year and a
.369 hitter, did nothing in eight at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   That all changed against Cougar starter Jacob Chrisman. Peavey
drilled a solo home run in the first and added two more hits and
drove in two more runs. Concepcion tripled in two runs in a seven-run
fourth inning and went three for four. Travis McAndrews added to the
onslaught with his second grand slam of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "[Opponents] pitched us really well the first two games," said
Peavey, who has 15 homers and 71 runs batted in. "I thought if we'd
stay with our approach and stay within ourselves, we'd get to
[Chrisman]."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in the USC lineup got at least two hits except second
baseman Anthony Lunetta. The first five batters--Brian Barre, Michael
Moon, Concepcion, Peavey and Joey Metropoulos--went 14 for 26 with
eight runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "What I stressed to my pitchers and catchers is that we didn't
want Concepcion and Peavey to beat us," BYU Coach Vance Law said.
"The first ballgame, that didn't happen. This time, Peavey got the
big home run and Concepcion got a big triple. They're a
line-drive-hitting team and they put the ball in play. When you do
that, there's never an easy out."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans needed almost every run to hold off a team that batted
.329 in four regional games. A 9-0 Trojan lead didn't faze the
Cougars as they got to USC starter Jordan Olson (3-2) in the fifth.
Jake Stubblefield hit the first of his two home runs to lead off the
inning. BYU then put together five consecutive hits and scored three
times to cut the lead to 9-4.</TE>
<TE>   USC got out of the inning when shortstop Moon used the hidden-ball
trick, catching Doug Jensen stepping away from second base and
tagging him to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I put [the ball] under my arm and hoped that no one would figure
it out," Moon said. "Jordan saw it perfectly and picked up the rosin
bag and threw it down in frustration to let everyone think he had the
ball. The key thing is the second base umpire knew what was going on.
We've tried it a couple of times before and tagged the guy but either
the umpire calls time out or doesn't see what is going on."</TE>
<TE>   Moon hit a solo home run in the sixth but the Cougars kept coming
back. Jensen singled in a run and Matt Carson doubled in another to
cut the lead to 10-6. Brett Bannister, who pitched six scoreless
innings in relief to beat the Cougars Friday, gave up a sacrifice fly
to Rob Itri before serving up a two-run homer to Stubblefield.</TE>
<TE>   Comebacks are nothing new to BYU (31-31-1), which erased a
seven-run Nevada Las Vegas lead in the Mountain West Conference
tournament and a 5-2 Maine lead in an elimination game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been very easy for us down 9-0 to fold up the
tent," Law said. "Our guys have way too much character to let that
happen."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans again got a key performance from senior Cory Campos,
this time out of the bullpen. Campos, who pitched 6 2/3 strong
innings to beat Northridge on Saturday, bailed out the shaky relief
corps by getting the final five outs.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander struck out Itri with the bases loaded in the
eighth to preserve an 11-10 lead, then pitched the ninth for his
sixth save.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is how it should be.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets get the Lakers now. They get Nicholson in the front row
and Shaq in the middle, Phil Jackson crossing his legs on the bench
and Kobe Bryant scraping the sky.</LD>
<LD>   They get the ghosts of Wilt and Kareem, Elgin and West and Magic.
They get all of it from the moment they step off the plane.</LD>
<TE>   You couldn't ask for a more perfect final chapter.</TE>
<TE>   If the Nets are going to the Finals anyway, why shouldn't they
have the world's best team waiting for them?</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely have our work cut out for us, no question about
that," Keith Van Horn said Sunday night, after living and dying on
the couch, watching the Lakers finally outlast the Kings in overtime,
112-106.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange," he added. "I watched so many Laker games growing
up, and now I'm playing the Lakers. And because of the Lakers, I
watched so many Celtic games too, and we've already beaten them.
Somehow, it's like I'm back in the middle of all those old
Lakers-Celtics battles."</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn, who grew up in Diamond Bar, isn't the only one who will
feel that way.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd grew up in Northern California, but his game is SoCal
all the way, a direct descendant of the Magic Johnson school of point
guard play.</TE>
<TE>   Lucious Harris is from Los Angeles, used to taunt the neighborhood
kids by rooting for Larry Bird, pulling for the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there is Byron Scott, the man who pulls the Nets'
strings, who grew up in Inglewood, then forged a piece of legend for
himself as a key member of the Showtime Lakers who ruled the 1980s.
You know, this is how they all wanted this remarkable run to end,
playing the Lakers for the championship.</TE>
<TE>   So now the Nets get seven games and two weeks to be Namath and the
Jets, to be Jimmy V and the North Carolina State Wolfpack. Most of
them vowed not to watch the Laker-King game. It wasn't until Van
Horn's wife, Amy, flicked on the second half that he reluctantly
agreed to watch. In the blink of an eye, his palms were sweaty.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the start of overtime, he admitted, "This is the most
nerve-racking experience of my life! How do people do this all the
time? How do they watch a game and know there isn't a thing they can
do about the outcome?"</TE>
<TE>   He laughed nervously.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess this proves that I'm a player," Van Horn said. "I'm
definitely not cut out to be a fan."</TE>
<TE>   Funny thing, though. By the time the game was over, Van Horn's
palms were dry.</TE>
<TE>   His stomach was fine. His heartbeat was back to normal. The player
was back.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a great feeling," he said. "I was thinking about one of
the games I went to as a kid. We sat behind the Celtics' bench, and
at every timeout, they would stand and I would see those names
stretched out on the back of their warmups and I'd think, 'Man, what
a great thing, being out there in one of those games.'"</TE>
<TE>   He paused.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I'm about to find out."</TE>
