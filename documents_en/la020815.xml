<LD>ALICE GUY BLACHE</LD>
<LD>   Lost Visionary of the Cinema</LD>
<LD>   By Alison McMahan</LD>
<TE>   Continuum</TE>
<TE>   362 Pages, $35</TE>
<TE>   Alice Guy Blache (1873-1968) was the young secretary-office
manager to French film pioneer Leon Gaumont who persuaded her boss to
let her try writing and directing some shorts that were to become
among the first fiction films ever made.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Herbert Blache, immigrated to America,
eventually setting up their own production company that had
all-too-brief success. By 1920, Guy Blache had directed her last
feature, and she would die in virtual obscurity in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it is supremely significant for film historian Alison
McMahan in her book, "Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the
Cinema," that Guy Blache's 24 years behind the camera constitutes the
longest career among the cinema pioneers, embodying the full
flowering of the feature-length screen narrative.</TE>
<TE>   In telling Guy Blache's story, McMahan, who teaches at Vassar, has
done a monumental job of excavation to locate her subject's place in
the history of the cinema, a place that proves to be more important
than previously realized. McMahan lays out the evolution of the
cinema, and its development that went hand-in-hand with studies in
motion and even aerodynamics. She sees the movies emerging as part of
a great, interconnected "drive to mechanize" that characterized the
19th century's age of invention. The birth of the movies was like
that of the automobile, an international parallel, competitive
phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   What is important here is not so much whether Guy Blache made the
first fictional film, something she never claimed. McMahan shows that
Louis Lumiere takes that honor, with Guy Blache vying with Georges
Melies for a none-too-shabby second place. Gaumont, concerned above
all with selling movie equipment, was not interested in movie-making
at a time--1896--when the movies were essentially brief newsreels or
film records of music hall entertainers or any other "actuality" that
caught a cameraman's eye.</TE>
<TE>   But Guy Blache had another idea. She asked Gaumont's permission to
write a little sketch and would ask some friends to act under her
direction. (It was a brief tale about a woman buying a baby from a
fairy.) She would shoot it in a patio at the Gaumont plant. Gaumont
said yes--provided she not skimp on her office duties.</TE>
<TE>   Guy Blache would put in extremely long hours before she became
Gaumont's very successful sole filmmaker, eventually hiring others
and laying the foundation of the studio system long before Thomas
Ince and his Culver City studio.</TE>
<TE>   In culling the 111 extant films of Guy Blache--stored in many
places, some in desperate need of preservation, among the more than
1,000 she made--McMahan has traced Guy Blache's steady growth as an
innovative screen storyteller who discovered the power of the
close-up long before D.W. Griffith did.</TE>
<TE>   Guy Blache also displayed a feminist sensibility without being
preachy. She saw women and men as equals. She treated her husband,
who was involved in the business end of the company and studio, as an
equal even though he was not up to her level.</TE>
<TE>   He may have run off to Hollywood with one of his actresses after
the loss of their Fort Lee, N.J., plant, but McMahan evenhandedly
refutes that it was Blache who ruined the business. McMahan shows
that as the teens wore on and the motion picture industry expanded
convulsively, Guy Blache could not get distribution for the films she
produced. She began making short sound films in 1902, launched some
major careers (including that of France's great serial king, Louis
Feuillade) and, the only woman filmmaker to this day who owned her
own studio, became a director for hire.</TE>
<TE>   In her memoirs, Guy Blache does not say why in the early '20s she
forsook Hollywood without apparently trying to find work here, to
return to France with her two young children. McMahan suspects that
having lost her studio and her husband, she craved the solace of
family in France. (A lack of funds to invest prevented her from
reactivating her career at Nice's fabled Victorine Studios.) She
supported herself mainly by writing novelizations of films and
returned to the U.S. at the outbreak of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   McMahan provides appendices that reveal the collaborative
detective work essential to accurate film history. She also provides
a filmography, a daunting achievement when so much of her subject's
work has been lost and much of it was uncredited on the screen.
McMahan then caps her own major feat of enlightened--and
enlightening--scholarship with a complete list of where all of Guy
Blache's known films reside, leaving us eager to see them for
ourselves.</TE>

<DH>Design Within Reach opens in Santa Monica next week, but
you still have to order via the Web</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't be fooled by the furnishings inside Design Within Reach's first
Southern California studio, which opens next week in Santa Monica.
Yes, you can see the mail-order company's collection of Arco floor
lamps, feel the smooth leather on a Le Corbusier chaise longue and
get a price quote on the Eileen Gray adjustable table, but you can't
take anything home.</LD>
<LD>   You can, however, "test drive" the 200 pieces of contemporary
furniture, lighting and accessories on display, and then place an
order via the company's Web site by using the studio's computer or
returning home to yours.</LD>
<LD>   Sound inconvenient? That's not what Rob Forbes had in mind when he
launched Design Within Reach three years ago to sell high-quality
reproductions of classic modern furniture as well as licensed designs
and exclusive new pieces directly to the public. Most of what is seen
in the company's studios, catalogs and Web site is typically found in
showrooms open only to design professionals, and can take four or
more weeks to be installed in a home or office. Design Within Reach
ships in half that time.</LD>
<TE>   Chairs dominate the Oakland-based company's offerings. There's a
seating gallery with 100 different chairs and stools mounted on the
studio's main wall. "Putting them on the wall reminds us that each
product is a free-standing piece of art," explains manager Fabiola
Zambon. "Lots of our customers were art history majors, and they find
design meaningful in their lives. We're in the business of making it
accessible to them and still staying true to the design. They
appreciate that."</TE>
<TE>   As with the company's three studios in the Bay Area, events such
as wine and chair tastings, product reviews, lectures and book
signings are planned for the studio, 332-A Santa Monica Blvd., Santa
Monica. For more information, (310) 899-6000; www.dwr.com.</TE>
<TE>   Sharing the Promenade</TE>
<TE>   A block from the Design Within Reach studio on the Third Street
Promenade is Hennessey + Ingalls, an independent bookstore that
specializes in the visual arts. Manager Douglas Woods says the store,
which has been on Santa Monica's pedestrian promenade for 20 years,
has always catered to artists, architects, set designers and
students, but he's seen an increased interest from the general public
in art books. "There's a phenomenon of people from all walks of life
who are becoming obsessed with design, and their awareness of design
history is impressive," he says. "The success of [nearby contemporary
design] stores like Ultra House at Dom and Knoll is reflective of
people's interest in shaping their personal space."</TE>
<TE>   Hennessey + Ingalls, which houses thousands of new and rare books,
is at 1254 Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica, (310) 458-9074,
www.hennes seyingalls.com. Ultra House at Dom is at 1245-A 3rd St.,
Santa Monica, (310) 656-1122, www.ultrahouseonline.com; Knoll is at
214 W. Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica, (310) 289-5800, www.knoll .com.</TE>
<TE>   Reinventing the Ordinary</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles'
California Plaza huddle around the display, cock their heads to one
side and ask, "What is it?" They're not talking about a Warhol
painting, in the main galleries through Sunday, but about a dish
drainer in the museum store.</TE>
<TE>   Futuristic designer Marc Newson's Dish Doctor ($65) is made of
molded plastic and presented in such color combinations as soft white
and light blue, or bold orange and green. There are two silverware
holders and rows for dishes.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian-born Newson, who was trained as a sculptor, has
built a reputation on changing the appearance of ordinary objects
without sacrificing their usefulness or durability.</TE>
<TE>   "Marc Newson is the hottest designer in terms of household items,"
says Grant Breding, director of retail operations at MOCA. "His
simple designs translate well to people-oriented products like
doorstops and hair dryers, but it's never obvious what they are. Even
though we've carried his dish drainer for a while, I still take
enjoyment in being in the store and overhearing people wonder what it
is."</TE>
<TE>   The Museum of Contemporary Art is at 250 S. Grand Ave., Los
Angeles, (213) 621-2766; bookstore, (213) 621-1710, www.moca.org.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To have sweet peas in bloom by the December holidays, sow seeds in
the ground before Labor Day. The climbing kinds (some are very
fragrant) make the best flowers for cutting. Grow in rows against a
wall or fence, or in big containers, providing something for the
plants to climb. Soak seed overnight before sowing.</LD>
<LD>   Here's another August opportunity where winters are mild: planting
tomatoes for midwinter fruit. In a warm, protected spot that will
remain sunny as shadows lengthen, put in small plants of 'Champion',
'Celebrity' or 'Sweet 100' tomatoes. Planted now, these varieties
will ripen by Thanksgiving. Each bush will bear less than in summer,
and the skins will be thicker, but who's going to complain in
January?</LD>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington designer Burkey Belser is the wizard behind the Nutrition
Facts label on packaged foods, the finest example of information
design produced in this country in decades. So it should come as no
surprise that he's a stickler for labels of any kind.</LD>
<LD>   Take the ones on his 10-speed kitchen blender. The buttons were
marked Chop, Grate, Grind, Stir, Puree, Whip, Mix, Blend, Frappe,
Liquefy. "If I'm not mistaken," he said recently to colleagues, "you
turn this thing on and the blades whir around with a singular
purpose: slaughtering everything within reach." Belser created his
own one-word identifier: Vaporize. For the buttons, he created a
scale of speed, from "In a Second" to "Now."</LD>
<LD>   Belser, who is more poet than cook, has customized his microwave
oven, too. The original touch pad offered such mesmerizing
possibilities as Auto Reheat, Quick On, Micro Time and Micro Temp. As
a consumer, Belser found such terms mystifying. As a designer, he
knew that confusion diminishes the effectiveness of any product. His
family mainly cooks popcorn in the machine, so he relabeled it.
Function buttons now say: Popcorn, Power Control, Whatever, Whatever,
Whatever. "Appliances are from Venus, consumers are from Mars," he
complains.</LD>
<TE>   Belser is a partner in the Greenfield/Belser marketing agency,
founded with his wife, Donna Greenfield. Their specialty is brand
design for law firms. The passion for re-imagining housewares comes
from Belser's second persona as guarantor of the public's right to
count calories in a candy bar without squinting.</TE>
<TE>   The Nutrition Facts box identifies at a glance how much fat,
sodium and sugar lurks in every portion. The design is so simple that
the label works for virtually anyone, regardless of age, eyesight,
reading ability, cultural origin or language of birth. Belser had to
balance the interests of food lobbyists, government scientists and
interested members of Congress. He worked for three hectic months for
free, because the Food and Drug Administration had neglected to
budget for a design fee. Belser was honored with a Presidential
Design Award in 1997. "I can feel good about it," he says. "Not very
often do designers get to impact millions of people."</TE>
<TE>   Belser and crew have applied the same clarity to a Drug Facts
label, which began appearing on over-the-counter medicines in May.
Belser also designed the Energy Guide sticker on appliances such as
refrigerators and washing machines.</TE>

<LD>Cacti</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever seen a big, round plant covered with sharp spikes?
It's called a barrel cactus, and, like its many odd-looking relatives
in the cactus family, it really knows how to take care of itself.</LD>
<LD>   Cacti (that's what you call more than one cactus) grow in all
shapes and sizes. Some are just a few inches tall, and others grow as
tall as a building, with arms as thick as tree trunks. They might not
look related, but they have more in common than you'd think.</LD>
<TE>   Cacti thrive in deserts and other hot, dry climates because they
have thick, protective skin and they store water for the dry times.
On cacti, what look like leaves and stems are really pads, joints or
cylinders that stay plump with moisture when other plants are wilting
with thirst during a hot summer. The thick skin helps keep the water
in by preventing evaporation.</TE>
<TE>   In spring and summer, many cacti have big, brightly colored
flowers, but if you tried to pick one you'd learn a lesson most
animals already know. Thorn-like spikes that cover their skin are
like a "Stay Away" sign that anyone can read. Many look like
pincushions with the sharp points facing out.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California is semiarid (that's almost as dry as a
desert), and cacti are happy here. A good place to see cacti and

<LD>Even in a couch-potato culture that worships the twin idols of
vicarious experience and virtual reality, it might seem far-fetched
to describe photography as "an action sport." But for Galen Rowell,
the celebrated nature photographer who died with his wife, Barbara
Cushman Rowell, in a plane crash earlier this week, the phrase fit as
comfortably as an old pair of hiking boots.The desire to see deeply
into nature took the Berkeley-born Rowell far beyond passive
spectatorship. For him, photography was a means of attaining a
heightened state of being, a raised level of moral awareness, which
could be as physically exacting and spiritually transforming as
scaling a Himalayan summit. For Rowell, in fact, these activities
were all but inseparable.</LD>
<LD>   Daring and athletic yet contemplative and inwardly focused,
Rowell, who was 61, combined scientific wanderlust with the vision
and passion of a great artist. One magazine accurately described him
as "a cross between Sir Edmund Hilary and Ansel Adams."</LD>
<LD>   Rowell loped across continents, sprinting up mountains in Africa
and Pakistan and rambling through Patagonia and Antarctica armed only
with his Nikon and compass-like artistic convictions to guide him.
Frequently he'd be accompanied by Barbara, 54, an accomplished
photographer and writer and a licensed pilot who flew a Cessna 206
while her husband snapped pictures from on high.</LD>
<TE>   What resulted were images of startling beauty and technical
virtuosity--a roseate Marin County surf at twilight; King Penguins
mobbing South Georgia Island like Grand Central Station commuters; or
the antique steeple of a Tibetan Buddhist monastery gracefully
offsetting the spires of Mt. Everest, in a perfect equipoise of
nature and humanity. Many of these images subsequently found their
way onto book and magazine covers and posters around the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Rowell's pictures didn't subscribe to a blandly pleasing
coffee-table aesthetic. Artfully composed, carefully cropped natural
beauty by itself didn't interest him. Instead, throughout his career,
and especially as his art matured, Rowell relentlessly searched for
what he called "the dynamic landscape" with which to fashion "a
portrait of the Earth as a living, breathing being that will never
look the same twice."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing a crucial distinction between "timeless landscape
photography" and "timely journalism," Rowell said his goal was to
combine photographic vision--what the camera literally sees--with his
own mind's eye "visualization" to "make images that exceeded normal
perception." This, of course, could describe the method of
practically any photographer who wants to do more than simply
document the visible. But what set Rowell apart from the
photojournalistic masses was the lengths he would go, and occasional
perils he would endure, to bag a great image.</TE>
<TE>   A skilled outdoorsman and climber, he made scores of ascents in
the Yosemite Valley and the High Sierra, took part in major
expeditions to Mt. Everest, K2 and Pakistan's Gasherbrum II and made
the first one-day ascents of Alaska's Mt. McKinley and Mt.
Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.</TE>
<TE>   His physical resourcefulness was matched by his painterly
insights. "Split Rock and Cloud" looks like one of Robert
Motherwell's great Abstract Expressionist works: a monumental mass of
silhouetted black rock, cleaved by a deep fissure, above which hovers
a Rorschach blot of thin white cloud. In a more traditionally
romantic vein, "Clearing Storm Over El Capitan" is a choral symphony
of mists, rock and trees straight out of an Albert Bierstadt
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   On a more intimate scale, a photo of a musk ox skull in North
Peary Land, its horns poking through clumps of moss spiked with
yellow flowers, becomes a visual tone poem, a memento mori. From
Kenyan peacocks to California poppies, Rowell's images never fell
into the static perfection of calendar art. Nature, he understood,
was too important to be merely picturesque.</TE>
<TE>   To get the image he wanted, Rowell thought nothing of hanging from
a sheer cliff face for hours at a time, or slogging through miles of
frozen tundra. "In a way I'm part of the picture, not just someone
standing there clicking the shutter," Rowell told People magazine in
1986.</TE>
<TE>   By acknowledging his sensibility in the frame, Rowell was also
conceding that in most modern landscapes, it's rare for a human
presence not to be implied or felt. There was nothing hermetic or
misanthropic about Rowell's love of nature, nothing that disdained or
feared the human element. And although humans appear sparingly in his
photos--often in the isolation of some surreal vista--they are never
depicted as bit players. Instead they're seen as vital agents,
altering the world through their actions and perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   In a photo titled "Return to Green Grass," a weary hiker framed by
snow-capped Asian peaks throws his arms wide in visible relief at
reaching lower altitudes. It's a deeply humane image of human frailty
and strength, exhaustion and exhilaration, in which nature is neither
an enemy nor backdrop, but something akin to a demanding and
unpredictable lover.</TE>
<TE>   In another meticulously composed image, a line of porters in
Pakistan's Braldu Gorge inches along an arching mountain footpath.
The drably dressed men blend into the rock formations like carvings,
emphasizing their essential harmony with their surroundings. The
visual tension created by the way the arched path slices through the
picture plane underscores the delicate equilibrium between the
enduring landscape and its temporal passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Rowell never tried to turn nature into a pristine abstraction. He
knew it was far too late to return to Eden. But he didn't passively
accept the ecological violence being inflicted on the world, or the
political violence inflicted on many of its inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through his career, he got into trouble with the Chinese
government for photographing a group of Tibetan tribesmen reverently
holding a photograph of the exiled Dalai Lama, the Buddhist leader,
that he'd just presented to them. In 1990, he wrote an article about
China's human rights and environmental abuses for the environmental
activist group Greenpeace and also published a book, "My Tibet," that
included essays by the Dalai Lama, winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace
Prize and foremost symbol of Tibetan independence.</TE>
<TE>   The book was a significant measure of the distance Rowell had
traveled, personally and politically, from his first trip to Tibet in
1981, when all he had wanted to do, he said, was record the beauty of
the land. Environmental and human rights groups later would credit
him for raising awareness of Tibet's afflictions.</TE>
<TE>   In an "artist statement" posted on the Web site called Mountain
Light, the gallery and multipurpose business that he and Barbara ran
in Bishop, Calif., Rowell wrote that "my interest in photography did
not begin with a burning desire to see the world through a camera. It
evolved through an intense devotion to wilderness that eventually
shaped all parts of my life and brought them together."</TE>
<TE>   By letting his art follow his love of the natural world, and his
moral conscience follow his art, Galen Rowell observed life from the
high ground. By raising his vision he elevated himself and, by
extension, us. Lucky us.</TE>

<LD>I am taking names.</LD>
<LD>   I am sitting in an overpacked car on an overpacked highway, at the
boiling point of a sweltering August day, and as three lanes of
vacationer-to-vacationer traffic jams merge into two lanes of
vacationer-to-vacationer traffic, I am taking names.</LD>
<LD>   I am taking the name of the individual who is responsible for
designing the system in which three lanes of fast-moving traffic
merge into two lanes. Was there a mix-up? Was something lost in the
translation? Did he mean to squeeze two lanes of traffic into three
lanes? Because that might work, even late on a Saturday morning at
the height of vacation season.</LD>
<TE>   But three lanes into two, yeah, I got his name right on the top of
the list, just below that of the guy who came up with the idea for
the traffic circle.</TE>
<TE>   The heat is unbearable, mid-90s, humid, no breeze. Yet the air is
crisp compared with the shimmering waves of blast-furnace radiation
rising from the road.</TE>
<TE>   The person who invented blacktop? It had to be black? It couldn't
have been white, or maybe something in linen? Yeah, I'm taking his
name. Another name I want is that of the guy who engineered
automobile air-conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   Automobile air-conditioning is a wonderful thing, when you are
moving. When you are sitting in a creeping line of stop-and-roll
traffic, all air-conditioning does is make engine lights glow.</TE>
<TE>   We can put a man into cyberspace, grow hair on the bald, but we
can't make an automobile air-conditioning system that doesn't take
your car engine to Defcon-1 when you are stranded in summer traffic?</TE>
<TE>   OK, so I'm getting a little testy.</TE>
<TE>   My car is now next to a tractor-trailer truck, which, judging from
its decibel level, is powered by the same engine as the Concorde's.</TE>
<TE>   There is no escape.</TE>
<TE>   I am taking the name of the cell-phone-yakking driver directly in
front of me, who doesn't move until the gap between her and the next
car is 100 feet or so.</TE>
<TE>   I am taking the name of the dude behind me, whose pumped-up radio
bass is making my brain pulsate. And I am taking the name of the
moron who has just driven past in the breakdown lane. Shouldn't we be
allowed to shoot at these people?</TE>
<TE>   Vacation, yeah. Getting there is half the fun.</TE>

<DH>Kids at a three-week program say paint-ball games test

<LD>Swathed in camouflage gear, the Shadow Warriors trudge up the dusty
path through the pines to Hamburger Hill. Their mission: to ambush
the enemy and cut off his supply line.</LD>
<LD>   Soon the silence is broken by the pop-pop-pop of paint guns. The
"bullets"--gelatin-covered capsules the size of gumballs--kick up
little puffs of dirt as they hit the ground. Too many have gone
astray. Rocky is not pleased.</LD>
<LD>   "Half of you guys must have been asleep," he tells his troops as
they take a rest break. Their target, Butter, had walked through
their attack virtually unscathed. "I should have been laid out,"
Butter says.</LD>
<TE>   And, adds Rocky, "You lost one of your team members." A splash of
white paint on camper John Schoeman's goggles means that he has been
taken out.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to secret-agent camp. Lured perhaps by the Pali Adventures
brochure--"Do you want to be the next James Bond? How about Indiana
Jones in training or a member of Spy Kids?"--about 25 boys have come
to Pali Mountain in Running Springs for a three-week adventure.</TE>
<TE>   After being blasted out of their bunks by wake-up music pumped
campwide at 7:15, the Shadow Warriors scarf down bacon and eggs and
waffles before heading out to the "battlefield" at 9.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go, secret agents, hurry up," said Rocky, dressed for the
mission in black T-shirt and camouflage pants, with a camouflage
bandanna tied on his head. Rocky has a real name--Deon Wilson--but,
in keeping with the fantasy factor of summer camp, he and other
staffers are known to the campers only by make-believe monikers.
Among these: Cracker, Tank, Twitch, Smiley, Flame and Pickles. The
secret-agent campers also choose code names. Among the more notable
have been Viper, Virus, Scorpion, Special K, Stirfry, Spitfire, Cobra
and Dracula.</TE>
<TE>   The day's mission begins in a netting-draped shack, where campers
don their camouflage and helmets with built-in goggles and grab a
paint gun off the wall rack. As a visitor slips into an orange vest
(for high visibility) and helmet, one kid warns mischievously, "Be
careful. Sometimes the ones wearing orange get shot."</TE>
<TE>   Paint ball "really gets you pumping," says an enthusiastic Michael
"Anarchy" Joseph, 14, who's on a paint-ball team back home in
Cleveland. "It's the reason I came to this camp. I looked all over
the U.S. for a paint-ball game. This is perfect. It can't get any
better."</TE>
<TE>   "The best," agrees Terry "Dodger" Metsch, 13, from the San Diego
suburb of Del Cerro. "I like the adrenalin." And "you learn a lot
about yourself" when faced with the challenges of secret-agent camp,
which include an awesome rope-climbing course.</TE>
<TE>   Terry, who wants to be a lawyer, learned about this camp from a
paint-ball magazine and thought, "Paint ball and camp. What better?"
People not in the know about paint ball "think we're weird," said
Michael. "They think of us as rednecks," when the reality, he says,
is that paint ballers are a community in which people look out for
one another.</TE>
<TE>   "I can hate somebody on my team, but we're on a team. We have to
work together ... and get it done." He explains that he chose Anarchy
as his code name "because I'm not afraid to get shot. I'd take one
for the team if I had to."</TE>
<TE>   And do his parents--who forked over more than $3,000 for Michael's
three-week camp adventure--share his enthusiasm? "My parents hate
guns." Most parents, says Terry, are "really shaky about it at
first--uh-oh, guns."</TE>
<TE>   Another big draw at camp is the food prepared by Egyptian chef
Sharif Elhadidi, who once cooked in L.A. for a family of Arab royals,
whose big hits are the omelet bar and pasta bar. Elhadidi, whose
typical fare includes chicken Marsala and Cajun salmon, has learned
in three years at Pali that the kids "can only take so much fancy
food. You have to throw in a hamburger now and then." But, he adds,
"you can make it with roasted-garlic mayo."</TE>
<TE>   In the earlier session of secret-agent camp, there were five
girls. This session there are none among the 20-plus junior agents.
Half a dozen girls  had signed up to take paint ball as an elective
activity while enrolled in another of the specialty camps such as
acting or modeling, but packed up their paint guns and left after the
first day.</TE>
<TE>   Though the paint-ball sessions seem more like combat training,
secret-agent camp also includes martial arts, coordinated rapid room
entries (in which a small team of secret agents enters a room without
being seen, grabs a hostage, and gets out fast) and a three-day
survival camp-out that includes a 45-mile hike. Kids learn to cook
their own food and "bear bag" it to protect the food, and themselves,
from the resident four-footers. On Monday, campers will be treated to
an on-site demonstration of maneuvers by a San Bernardino County SWAT
team.</TE>
<TE>   For these secret-agents-in-training, though, paint ball is the big
attraction. For the uninitiated, paint ball is an extreme-sport
version of capture the flag. The weapon, resembling a rifle, fires
the carbon dioxide-propelled pellets at a maximum of 180 feet per
second rather than its potential maximum, in this case, of 280, to
minimize bruising on impact. "If they hit you in the arm, it's not as
bad as if they hit you in the gut," says a paint-splattered John,
who's just taken a somewhat mortifying, if painless, hit square on
his goggles. He is Pyro, a code name he says he chose "because I like
to burn things."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, when a pellet goes splat, releasing the paint inside, it
stings--even through heavy clothing. Tears are not unknown among
secret-agent campers but, says Rocky, "at lunch they're comparing war
wounds" and relishing every moment.</TE>
<TE>   Rocky, 32, an Aussie who served six years in a paratrooper unit
with the Australian army--two of those as a jungle warfare
trainer--and for the last four years has been a prison guard, is by
consensus of the young secret agents "very cool." If they get rowdy,
he quiets them with a repeat-after-me "Yo, yo, yo." Less than pleased
with how the Shadow Warriors carried out this last ambush, he warns
that an advanced ambush is coming up, "So shape up or you'll be shot
and we'll make you be dead for the whole day."</TE>
<TE>   As Birdcage trots by en route to Hamburger Hill, Rocky is readying
his Shadow Warriors for a hostage rescue, with staffer Twitch
portraying a terrorist and staffer Gish his female hostage. The
terrorist and his prey are in a tent at the bottom of a slope; he is
armed and desperate. The Shadow Warriors split into two teams, one
gathering at the top of the ridge, the other finding blind spots from
which to launch an assault on the tent. "I want to hear lots of fire
from the snipers," Rocky orders. One kid asks, "Do we yell
'surrender?' " No, says Rocky. "Just go in."</TE>
<TE>   Rocky in the lead, the assault team descends the hill, dodging
ammo. As they reach the tent, Rocky yells, "Keep shooting! Drag her
out! Get off your bums and move!" "My heroes," gushes Gish, as they
lead her to safety.</TE>
<TE>   The snipers have killed one of their own. Ryan "Riot" Potter, 12,
of San Clemente has taken a hit "square on the spine. It hurt a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Camp staffer Cracker takes charge for the next exercise, which is
to take out a pair of the enemy hiding behind a bunker. His secret
agents hesitate, dodging behind trees on their way downhill. He
warns, "Don't worry about being hit. Keep going! Keep firing! If you
guys don't move forward, I'll line you up and shoot you myself.
You're looking at me, looking at your sleeves to see if you've got
paint on you. That's not what you do. I don't want people way back
here wasting 200 bullets.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to believe in yourself and the gun and your teammates.
Understand?"</TE>
<TE>   Among the secret-agent campers are two Germans, Michael Schramm,
15, from Stuttgart and Alex Grosse, 16, from Munich. Alex's parents
sent him to Pali for ESL (English as a second language) camp, but he
persuaded them to let him switch to secret-agent camp, which is much
more fun. Though paint ball is played on U.S. Army bases in Germany,
Michael says, "it's not allowed in Germany, actually," as the country
has very strict rules about gun use.</TE>
<TE>   With paint ball, Rocky says, "basically, we're using army
tactics," but with paint pellets rather than blanks, kids "get the
concept that they really do get hit." He sees paint ball as a morale
and self-confidence builder and says he's heard no objections from
parents. "If we are going to have guns, we might as well learn to use
them safely."</TE>
<TE>   Experts are divided on this issue. Beverly Hills psychiatrist
Carole Lieberman, who is on the clinical faculty at UCLA
Neuropsychiatric Institute, finds the concept of secret-agent camp
for kids "revolting. I've always been against paint ball because it's
violent, and playing violent games has been shown to cause children
to be violent, not just during the game but afterward. We should be
teaching our children peace rather than to make war. Basketball is a
healthy outlet, softball is a healthy outlet, swimming is a healthy
outlook. I think the whole idea of secret-agent camp is sick."</TE>
<TE>   But L.A. clinical psychologist Robert Butterworth, who specializes
in children and trauma, sees it differently. "When it's us versus
them, people tend to coalesce. If there's a common goal, we tend to
forget our differences." As for kids and gunplay, he says, "welcome
to the real world, guys. On the one hand, we are saying kids
shouldn't do this. On the other we're recruiting them to go into the
military."</TE>
<TE>   If something like secret-agent camp will teach kids to work
together, Butterworth says, "and they know the difference between
this and real life," and no one's getting hurt, "it won't be anything
worse than what we did when we were kids."</TE>
<TE>   First-time camper David "Thorn" Gasster, 11, of Rancho Park in
West L.A. says he came here "to learn how to survive out in the open
and learn how to handle guns. I might want to be a soldier."
Christopher Lin, 11, of Pasadena "wanted to learn what secret agents
do, how they train." Showing a bruise inflicted by a paint-ball hit,
he says he thinks James Bond is "pretty cool."</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, campers Michael Joseph and Taylor "Snipes"
Richards, 13, of San Diego are among those at the ropes course, where
campers learn aerial assaults. Both take on and conquer the Crow, a
sadistic-looking device consisting of three very long logs stacked
tepee-fashion and, at the top, a free-swinging mobile device of log
pieces wired together. To conquer the Crow, the climber must make a
dicey jump from the top of the base logs onto the footholds on the
swinging logs at the top. "The hardest thing I've ever done," says
Taylor, who's just scored on his first attempt. "I cut myself where
the sun don't shine."</TE>
<TE>   Michael, having mastered the Crow, is determined to try the Leap
of Faith, a newly installed and aptly named attraction. The climber,
wearing a safety harness, must scale a tree about 60 feet up, then
leap from a platform and attempt to grab a bar dangling from a rope
about 15 feet away. He misses, twice, but will try again another day.</TE>
<TE>   It's dusty and dry over on the motocross course, but some days the
course is flooded, to create a muddy, slippery surface on which the
young agents practice evasive driving techniques in peppy one-seater,
all-terrain vehicles. Rocky explains, "It gives the kid that
experience they see in the movies" during epic car chases. "They
don't realize those cars are so tricked-up it's not funny."</TE>
<TE>   So, as night falls, the secret agents hunker down to watch James
Bond movies, right? Not quite. Most of those are rated for the
13-and-over set--something the camp strictly monitors. Rocky says,
"The only things I can show them are things like 'Spy Kids.' "</TE>
<TE>   Secret-agent camp is just one of 11 three-week specialty camps
offered concurrently during the summer by Pali Adventures. Others
include whitewater adventure, scuba, water sports, skating mania,
horseback riding academy, acting academy, film institute and
modeling. Coming next summer: Hollywood stunt camp, cooking camp,
rock star camp and disc jockey camp. Campers pursue their specialty
in the morning, then interact with other campers at elective
activities in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old resident camp is an outgrowth of Pali Day Camp,
founded in Pacific Palisades in 1990 by Andrew Wexler, 33, a young
entrepreneur who graduated from UCLA and has an MBA from USC. His
wife, Jennifer, runs the year-round retreat and conference center at
the 74-acre campsite, which was from 1939 to 1999 the home of Camp
O-Ongo.</TE>
<TE>   Wexler, who conceived secret-agent camp, says, "We don't promote
gun use. It's all fun stuff. We really don't do anything violent.
They don't shoot at silhouettes. We're the new cowboys and Indians."</TE>
<TE>   He emphasizes that the object is not to train future secret agents
but, rather, "to teach teamwork. They're learning skills a secret
agent could use in the future, but so could a CEO of a company." Guns
"have never been an issue" with parents who send campers, Wexler
says. "There are more complaints that our modeling camp is
objectifying women."</TE>

<LD>People were talking all over the neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   "Did you hear about the Burts' new ice cream bar concoction?"</LD>
<LD>   "Ice cream bars coated in chocolate. And they have a handle!"</LD>
<TE>   "What do you know about that!"</TE>
<TE>   "And did you know that something is going on in front of the shop
right now?"</TE>
<TE>   When I heard that, I hurried to the shop. The Burts' old truck was
parked on the street, and Mr. Burt and Harry were painting it a
bright white--the entire truck.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me think of snow," one lady at the curb said.</TE>
<TE>   "Good," said Mr. Burt. "That's what we want you to think about.
Now we're ready to decorate the truck with the bells."</TE>
<TE>   "Here they are!" Ruth's mother answered, and she handed him a
string of bells.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth was there too, and I asked her, "Aren't those the bells that
decorated your family sleigh?" She nodded.</TE>
<TE>   The winter before, I had been invited to go on a ride with them
out in the countryside. As the horse pulled the sleigh over the snow,
we had a good time singing "Jingle Bells" along with the tinkling
music of the bells.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is your daddy moving the bells to the truck?" I asked Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   "He has another idea," Ruth answered. "Wait and see."</TE>
<TE>   The lady at the curb asked Mr. Burt, "What are you going to do
with this white truck now?"</TE>
<TE>   "Why should Harry and I wait for customers to come to us?" Mr.
Burt answered. "We are going to bring the ice cream to the
customers."</TE>
<TE>   "But the ice cream will melt," I cried.</TE>

<HD>Anthrax Case Poses Troubling Questions</HD>
<DH>Media* As name of Steven J. Hatfill makes headlines, it
brings to mind rush to judgment during '96 Olympics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one knows if he is guilty. But any American who has even glanced
at a newspaper or news broadcast in recent days by now knows Steven
J. Hatfill's name. They may not know the details of Hatfill's sudden
ascent to headline fame. But by this week, the American public knew
that the FBI was investigating the bioterrorism specialist in
connection with the anthrax letters that killed five and sickened at
least 13 more last fall.</LD>
<LD>   Hatfill's is the only name they know.</LD>
<LD>   This despite the fact that an unnamed senior federal law
enforcement official has been quoted in the media as saying Hatfill
is one of about 20 or more scientists who are considered "persons of
interest" in the investigation, based on their knowledge and access
to anthrax.</LD>
<TE>   However, Chris Murray, FBI spokesman for the Washington field
office, which is leading the investigation, said Wednesday that
Hatfill's name was "not from me" and not from anybody he knows. As
for Hatfill's designation as a "person of interest," Murray said, "I
have no idea where that came from. I've seen it in the press, but no
one in the FBI that I know has ever used that."</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill's sudden and ubiquitous presence in the national (and
international) media, without being named an official suspect,
without arrest, and without any direct evidence quoted by an
identified, on-the-record government source, raises perplexing
questions about how journalists should cover the investigation of
private citizens in connection with high-profile crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are even higher, the questions perhaps more
confounding, when the investigation involves issues of national
security in a climate of fear, all taking place in a high-tech era of
split-second information dissemination.</TE>
<TE>   Many print articles on Hatfill used the scientist's name and
delved into his professional background while also warning of the
potential pitfalls of treating him like Richard Jewell, the security
guard at the 1996 summer Olympics in Atlanta whom federal agents
initially suspected as the culprit in the deadly bombing at
Centennial Olympic Park.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI named only Jewell as a suspect, and the media ran with the
story, probing his life and background. Ultimately, however, the FBI
cleared Jewell of any involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Some too have made comparisons to scientist Wen Ho Lee,
investigated by the FBI on suspicion of espionage at the Los Alamos,
N.M., research facility. (The FBI's treatment of both men led to
stinging rebukes and formal apologies, and on Sept. 26, 2000, the New
York Times printed a 1,600-word "public accounting" of its aggressive
coverage of Lee. Lee spent nine months in jail, lost his job and
remains unemployed. Jewell sued a number of news organizations, and
several settled for what is believed to be more than $2 million,
according to a "60 Minutes" report aired on CBS in June. The report
said Jewell struggled to put his life back together for five years.
He then got a job as a police officer in a nearby community and got
married a year ago.)</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Jewell case, most major newspapers did not put
Hatfill's name on their front pages until he held a news conference
on Sunday denying his role in the anthrax attacks. News stories so
far have been careful to say there has been no direct evidence
linking Hatfill to the letters. Following Hatfill's news conference
the FBI issued a response:</TE>
<TE>   "We are unaware of any FBI employee who has named a suspect in the
anthrax death investigation," special agent Steven Berry, a
supervisory special agent in the press office at FBI headquarters in
Washington, D.C., repeated later in the week. "The FBI does not alert
the news media to the service of search warrants."</TE>
<TE>   Has an injustice been done to Hatfill, whose name is now linked
with the anthrax attacks in the public's mind? How should the media
balance the public's right to know in a high-profile case, with the
rights of an individual's right to privacy? Beyond invoking their
names at every turn, have the media or the FBI changed their
practices since the days of Richard Jewell and Wen Ho Lee?</TE>
<TE>   No, said Jewell attorney L. Lin Wood, who is still representing
his client in a defamation case pending against the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. He sees little progress on the part of the FBI.
"There has been no improvement. No lessons learned," he said.
"Because there is no accountability for the FBI's wrongdoing. I see
government officials speaking anonymously. Get someone on the record.
[Hatfill] is under investigation. Say that. It is the great
government doublespeak."</TE>
<TE>   Jewell, Wood said, has become the poster boy for the falsely
accused. Instead he should be considered a hero, he said, for the way
he saved at least 100 lives that day by clearing out a five-story
tower after spotting the bomb package. The main suspect now in that
case, survivalist Eric Rudolph, has never been caught.</TE>
<TE>   Wood said he does not know Hatfill, or the details of his case
beyond what he has seen in the news. But what he has seen disturbs
him.</TE>
<TE>   "We ought to have an FBI that is capable of investigating very
serious crimes," said Wood. "And they should be good enough to do so
outside the cameras and the media spotlight."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter
Institute, a journalism research institution in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
noted that the circumstances of the Jewell and Hatfill cases are very
different, but said the parallels between the bombing and the anthrax
incidents are "inescapable." He said the role of the federal
authorities in the two cases, and the pressure on them to solve those
cases, is also similar.</TE>
<TE>   The media must be mindful of the weight that comes with tone,
proportion and the way journalists tell stories, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Steele recalls the repeated airing of slow-motion video of Jewell
driving in his truck. "Slo-mo video can warp reality," he said. "It
can in some instances create a sinister impression of an
individual--the way they turn their head, they way they move their
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   He said the media can also learn from the Wen Ho Lee case that the
ways stories are constructed, or the way certain facts are
emphasized--even when accurate--can "give certain impressions."</TE>
<TE>   "In every newsroom there should be at least a triple
check-and-balance process in stories of allegations of wrongdoing,"
Steele said. "That goes for anthrax attack stories as well as
allegations of wrongdoing by the local Boy Scout leader. Personal and
professional lives are at stake."</TE>
<TE>   Steele said the way the story is played also influences the
public. "If the story is on the front page, or at the beginning of a
broadcast, there is a weight that goes with that, that tells readers,
viewers, 'This is important.' It heightens the belief that someone
is, if not guilty, at least suspicious."</TE>
<TE>   Like all critics interviewed for this story, Steele cautioned
journalists against using allegations that come from anonymous
sources and information that is leaked from sources who may have
ulterior motives. "Someone told the news media that there was about
to be a search at [Hatfill's] apartment," Steele said, alluding to
the fact that helicopters, satellite trucks and journalists were on
hand both times Hatfill's Frederick, Md., home was
searched--voluntarily on June 25, and with a warrant on Aug. 1. "The
media did not happen to be roaming around his apartment with
satellite trucks at that moment."</TE>
<TE>   The curious thing about Hatfill is that his name leaped to such
prominence without his ever being officially acknowledged by the FBI
as being under investigation. Since the spring, Hatfill's name has
circulated among scientists and journalists speculating about
possible domestic suspects in the anthrax attacks. Barbara Hatch
Rosenberg, a molecular biologist at Purchase College, State
University of New York, wrote this spring on a Web site for
scientists that she thought only a disgruntled American scientist
would have the technical expertise to produce the kind of anthrax
contained in the tainted letters. She estimated that fewer than 40
people could be suspects. But Rosenberg has never publicly named
Hatfill.</TE>
<TE>   Cinny Kennard, a former CBS correspondent and an assistant
professor at USC's Annenberg School for Communications who lectures
on ethics, said she thinks that in some ways the media have done a
good job of prodding the FBI to get the anthrax investigation moving
forward. But she believes that the tremendous speed at which news
travels today may demand a new system of journalistic ethics.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think our ethics and standards policies fit with this era
of technology we live in," Kennard said. "Maybe we need to use more
scrutiny than we have in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she said, the opposite is happening. In the old days, a
name could appear in the San Jose Mercury News, and an East Coast
paper wouldn't pick it up until a week later. "Now they get it in 30
seconds. Suddenly it's on 24-hour news channels, on the banner on
MSNBC, on televisions in the airport. The atmosphere of technology
should call for different ethics and standards."</TE>
<TE>   Wood, Jewell's attorney, also believes the media have a greater
responsibility now than ever before. "We are talking about a new
world post-Sept. 11. This is a country that desperately wants to
believe that the FBI knows what it is doing. They want to believe
they can pick up a newspaper and the information that they read is
accurate. That information can have an even greater impact now."</TE>
<TE>   It has already had an impact on Hatfill. After reporters pursued
Hatfill, he was fired from his contracting job at the Science
Applications International Corp. in March. Following the second
search of his home on Aug. 1, Louisiana State University, which had
hired him to teach federal agents and police to handle bioterrorism,
put him on paid leave for 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   "If I am a subject of interest, I am also a human being," he told
reporters Sunday. "I acknowledge the right of the authorities and the
press to satisfy themselves as to whether I am the anthrax mailer.
This does not, however, give them the right to smear me and
gratuitously make a wasteland of my life in the process."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Without any blockbuster new arrivals to challenge it, Bruce
Springsteen's "The Rising" held on to the top spot on the nation's
album sales chart for the second consecutive week.</LD>
<LD>   The collection, most of whose songs deal with the mourning and
resilience of the country in the weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, sold 239,000 copies to bring its total to 764,000, according
to the figures released Wednesday by Nielsen SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   The runners-up on the chart: Nelly's "Nellyville," which sold
208,000 to bring its seven-week total to 2.5 million, and Eminem's
"The Eminem Show," which sold 173,000 for a three-month total of 4.9
million.</LD>
<TE>   Two new rap releases debuted in the Top 10: Scarface's "Fix" and
Trick Daddy's "Thug Holiday." The rest of the Top 10 spots are
claimed, in order, by volume 10 of "Now That's What I Call Music,"
Linkin Park, Toby Keith, Avril Lavigne and the Dave Matthews Band.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's best-selling single is the Dixie Chicks' "Long Time
Gone."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the biggest star to emerge from the rave scene, Moby has never
forgotten his dance roots. So while he has David Bowie on the main
stage of his Area2 tour, Moby has allotted space for his peers from
the dance world to expose the art of the DJ to a new audience.</LD>
<LD>   Though it's a noble gesture, the setup of the dance tent at
Verizon Wireless Amphitheater on Tuesday was surprisingly shoddy. It
was thrown over a concrete parking lot, without any chairs or
cushions for seating. Nor was there a table or podium for the DJs,
preventing most of the fans from seeing them.</LD>
<LD>   Given these circumstances, the DJs are to be commended for their
solid, professional sets.</LD>
<TE>   Australia's Avalanches got things going with a sparkling hourlong
mix that ranged from hip-hop to world music and included such tunes
as the Police's "Can't Stand Losing You" and the intro of Guns N'
Roses' "Welcome to the Jungle."</TE>
<TE>   In adapting so well to the tough setting, the DJ duo set a mood
that the seemingly infallible DJ Dan picked up and ran with through a
nearly two-hour set that started on the progressive side (with large
synthesizer hooks) before moving over to disco/house beats.</TE>
<TE>   Holland's DJ Tiesto, with his Paul Oakenfold-influenced trance
grooves, turned in the most crowd-pleasing set, though it didn't
really pick up until halfway through, when he added some vocal tracks
for some much-needed warmth.</TE>
<TE>   Headliner John Digweed went on opposite Bowie's main-stage
performance, so the tent was nearly empty at the start. The
Englishman carried on, dazzling with a blend of percussive jungle
beats, synthesizer hooks and housey female vocals. And by the end of
his nearly two-hour performance, the tent was more than half-full
again.</TE>

<LD>   The mystery and romance of language are at the heart of
"Possession," Neil LaBute's adaptation of the lauded A.S. Byatt
novel. Gwyneth Paltrow, Aaron Eckhart, Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy
Northam play two couples--two literary critics and two poets--linked
over a century's time by scholarship and fate. Also Friday, LaBute
will present Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole" in the AFI/Skirball
Cultural Center's "Cinema's Legacy" series.</LD>
<LD>   "Possession," rated PG-13 for sexuality and some thematic
elements, opens Friday in selected theaters.</LD>
<TE>   "Cinema's Legacy: How Great Filmmakers Inspire Great Filmmakers,"
2701 N. Sepulveda Blvd., L.A. Neil LaBute presents "Ace in the Hole,"
Friday, 7:30 p.m. $6 to $10. (310) 440-4500.</TE>
<TE>   10pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Maraca serves up expert Afro-Cuban music direct from the
source--Cuba. The group, currently on tour to support its latest
album, "Tremenda Rumba," has been compared to seminal Cuban band
Irakere. That's not a great stretch considering that bandleader,
composer, multi-instrumentalist and arrange Orland "Maraca" Valle
spent six years in that group.</TE>
<TE>   Maraca, Sagebrush Cantina, 9523 Culver Blvd., Culver City. 10 p.m.

become Greek for a day at St. Sophia's Los Angeles Greek Festival.
The event features authentic Greek food, including roast lamb and
loukoumathes, plus music, theater, wine and, of course, dancing.
Adding to the ecumenical spirit, a salsa music and dance show will be
featured.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Greek Festival, St. Sophia's Cathedral, 1324 S.
Normandie Ave., L.A. Friday, 5 to 11 p.m.; Saturday, 11 a.m. to 11

<TE>   Whether you're an old-school punk or more of a ravester, "24 Hour
Party People" is likely to drive home a beat that suits you as it
covers 20 years in the Manchester, England, music scene. Steve Coogan
stars as Tony Wilson, a TV news reporter who sees an early Sex
Pistols show and goes on to found a club and a record label that
would produce two decades of stars, including Joy Division, New Order
and the Happy Mondays.</TE>
<TE>   "24 Hour Party People," rated R for strong language, drug use and
sexuality, in selected theaters.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   The Ahn Trio, three Juilliard-trained sisters, returns to Southern
California this week with a new program of familiar works by Satie
and Haydn, plus three pieces written especially for the Ahns. The new
works are Maurice Jarre's "Engadiner" Suite, in its U.S. premiere;
Michael Nyman's "Yellow Beach" (2001); and Kenji Bunch's "Swing
Shift: Music for Evening Hours" (2002).</TE>
<TE>   Ahn Trio, Ford Amphitheatre, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East, Hollywood,
8 p.m. $20. (323) 461-3673.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   When flamenco dancer and choreographer Andres Marin premiered his
"Mas alla del Tiempo" (Beyond Time) in France earlier this year, one
Lyon publication described him as having the look and defiant manner
of the young Al Pacino. Another wrote that "nothing depicts him as a
flamenco dancer, not his close-cropped-hair, nor his T-shirt and
tight-fitting pants, nor his fashionable tennis shoes." Marin also
broke the rules of classic flamenco with some of his musical choices
and his contemptuous attitude toward the holiest precincts of that
Gypsy art. ("Culturally, Andalusia is cow manure," is one such
put-down.) But all his rebellious PR wouldn't matter much if nothing
happened when he danced. However, everyone seemed to agree that he's
a true original, "a purist who is an innovator" (Lyon Capitale), "a
goblin with 1,000 faces" (Lyon Figaro) and "a glowing figure of
contemporary dance" (Le Progres).</TE>
<TE>   Compania Flamenca Andres Marin in "Mas alla del Tiempo," Irvine
Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine, 8 p.m. Also Saturday, 8
p.m.; Sunday, 6 p.m. $28 to $38. (949) 854-4646.</TE>
<TE>   6:30pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   The circus surrounding Eminem has often reached Barnum &amp; Bailey
proportions, so it's no surprise that the controversial rapper
employs a circus theme in his current Anger Management Tour, which
reaches the Southland this week. This year's lineup also features
Ludacris, Papa Roach and Eminem's old rap crew from Detroit, D12.</TE>
<TE>   Anger Management Tour, Blockbuster Pavilion, 2575 Glen Helen
Parkway, Devore, 6:30 p.m. $25 to $55. (909) 886-8742. Also today at

$32.50 to $43.50. (619) 671-3600.</TE>

<LD>all day Festival</LD>
<LD>   Approach and hear the sounds: gospel, jazz, blues, reggae,
doo-wop, hip-hop, slave hollers and Native American chants. Draw
closer and breathe in the enticing aromas: of gumbo, ceviche, rice
and peas, black beans, fried plantains, falafel, fou-fou and
barbecue. Then, when you can see the striking array of colorful
African garb, elaborate displays of fine arts and crafts, you'll know
that you have arrived at the Los Angeles African Marketplace &amp;
Cultural Faire. Now in its 17th year, the marketplace runs weekends
beginning Saturday through Sept 1. The theme of the annual event is
"Celebrating Africa's Global Legacy," and to that end there will be
trade and travel expos, literary, technology and restaurant
pavilions, children's, educational and health villages, short films,
a soccer tournament, games, continuous live entertainment, and more
than 200 arts and crafts and trade vendors.</LD>

Grimwood--give a free outdoor concert as part of the Getty Center's
"Outdoor Giggle and Wiggle" series. They've been playing music

<TE>   A new performance series titled "Caught Between: Dancing for
Camera and Live Audience" unites choreographers and film-or
video-makers in collaborative projects that let the audience
experience dance in two ways at once. A hot, close-up, technological
perspective on dance co-exists and interacts with the immediacy and
three-dimensional presence of theatrical dancing in pieces created by
some of our most daring multimedia artists. Participating
choreographers include Stephanie Gilliland, Rosanna Gamson, Kitty
McNamee, Jamie Nichols, Lauren Winslow-Kearns, Nina Kaufman, Alex
Magno, Nina Winthrop and the tireless Deborah Brockus, caught between
producing this event and choreographing for it.</TE>

<TE>   Hungarian artist Peter Forgacs combines his film-based work with
materials from the collections of the Getty Research Institute and
other lenders to create the multimedia interactive installation "The
Danube Exodus: The Rippling Currents of the River,'' opening Saturday
at the institute. Forgacs, in collaboration with the Labyrinth
Project at USC's Annenberg Center for Communications, addresses the
displacement of ethnic groups in Germany through sound, moving
images, large-scale projections, touch-screen maps, and archival
materials such as postcards, photo albums, and a three-volume
illustrated survey of the Danube published in 1726.</TE>

but they've settled enough of their differences with their own record
label to move ahead with the release of their long-delayed third
album, "Home," which arrives in stores Aug. 27. Local fans have a
chance to preview some of the new material and hear some previous
hits acoustic-style tonight and Friday at the Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood, where the trio is taping an NBC special slated to air this
fall. Concert-goers are advised to "dress as if you were going out on
the town on a Saturday night ... fancy for television."</LD>

<TE>   Trumpeter Marcus Printup is one of jazz's young lions who emerged
in the 1990s. He has recorded with the likes of Marcus Roberts, Carl
Allen, Eric Reed and Dianne Reeves, among others, and has been a
member of Wynton Marsalis' Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra since 1994.
His latest recording, "The New Boogaloo," has been described as hard
swinging and full of blues feeling, but not as overtly R&amp;B-flavored
as its title might suggest. Printup will be working at the Jazz
Bakery this weekend with Walter Blanding Jr. on sax, Eric Lewis on
piano, Vicente Archer on bass, and Donald Edwards on drums, the same
lineup (minus trombonist Wycliffe Gordon) on his CD.</TE>

Simon Morley, whose idea it was, and his partner in puppetry, David
Friend.</TE>

<LD>So my favorite doorman Steven Harlow just teamed up with promoter
John Abrams to host a new Thursday night shindig at Mark's, a La
Cienega Boulevard restaurant up the street from Koi. Harlow, who
works such hot spots such as the Viper Room and the Hollywood
Canteen, says DJ Scott Oster spins succulent rare grooves all night.
Groovy.... Divas were in the house at Les Deux Cafe in Hollywood on
Friday for a party celebrating singers Debbie Harry and Siouxsie
Sioux. Among the revelers were Nina Hagen, Cherie Curry, Macy Gray
and Patricia Arquette.... Speaking of divas, don't miss soul singer
Chaka Khan at the Sunset Junction street fair in Silver Lake on Aug.
25 at 8 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of Silver Lake, we popped into the tantalizing new
restaurant-club Tantra and were treated to quite possibly the best
Indian food this side of the Taj Mahal. With its nightly DJs and warm
hosts--the father-and-son team of Navraj and R.J. Singh--Tantra looks
like a winner.... Hot ticket tonight is at the Troubadour, as the
almighty Youth Brigade takes the WeHo nightclub's stage by storm. Two
decades, five albums, three brothers (Shawn, Adam and Mark Stern) and
still raging after all these years. And the Stern-owned BYO Records
label recently signed the sought-after San Francisco punk band One
Man Army and is releasing its album Oct. 15.</LD>
<TE>   Rapper WC's video shoot on Monday at the L.A. Coliseum for his new
single, "The Streets," drew appearances from Ice Cube, Nate Dogg, DJ
Pooh and Snoop Dogg, who recently gave up smoking ganja, his manager
reports.... Bumped into NOFX drummer Erik Sanden's wife Sarah in line
at the "Dogtown &amp; Z-Boys" DVD signing at Tower Records in Sh'Oaks
last Thursday. We were stocking up on Christmas gifts by getting the
autographs of such skate heroes as Tony Alva, Bob Biniak and Paul
Constantineau, who was using his Sharpie to design a new skateboard
out of the wood signing table. Once a punk, always a punk.</TE>

<HD>Pay Disparity, in Any Language</HD>
<DH>Media* A study finds that Spanish-language broadcasters in
L.A. lag in salaries and unions versus their English-speaking
counterparts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Los Angeles has the nation's largest Spanish-speaking
population, broadcasters at Spanish-language stations here are paid
significantly less than their counterparts at rival English-language
stations, according to the first academic study of pay disparity in
the local broadcast news business.</LD>
<LD>   The study was released Wednesday by UCLA's Chicano Studies
Research Center, and it points to "a dramatic disparity between
Spanish-speaking broadcasters and their English-language
counterparts, particularly in terms of income, benefits, working
conditions and union representation."</LD>
<LD>   The report's principle author, Abel Valenzuela Jr., an associate
professor of Chicano studies and urban planning, took salary surveys
from 114 local Spanish-language broadcasters in L.A. over the last
year and conducted in-depth interviews with 14 of the respondents.</LD>
<TE>   "They had a pretty good inclination that they were making less
than their English-language counterparts," Valenzuela said. "The
industry is small enough that broadcasters talk to one another and,
frankly, word gets around."</TE>
<TE>   For English-language broadcasters' salaries, UCLA relied on data
from the broadcasters' union, the American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists, which now includes a Spanish-language media
project.</TE>
<TE>   According to AFTRA, on-air talent at English-language TV stations
have a median salary of $200,000 and on-air talent at
English-language radio stations have a median salary of $90,000.
That's 70% more than their competitors at Spanish-language TV
stations, whose median income averages $60,001 and Spanish-language
radio broadcasters, whose median income average hovers around
$41,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about a difference of a few thousand dollars,"
Venezuela said Wednesday. "We're talking three times the amount in TV
and two times the amount in radio."</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela and coauthor Darnell Hunt, a professor of sociology and
the director of UCLA's Center for African American Studies, used
median salaries, not averages, because they wanted to avoid skewed
data as a result of high salaries paid to anchormen and -women.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA report shows differences are stark with regard to
organizing workers. Every English-language TV station in L.A. has had
representation, many for 60 years, but only two Spanish-language
broadcast companies in L.A. have union representation.</TE>
<TE>   One of those, Metro Networks, a subcontractor owned by Westwood
One that provides traffic and news reports to Spanish-and
English-language radio stations, organized this year.</TE>
<TE>   KMEX-TV, the flagship of Univision, the country's largest
Spanish-language television network, has had a union for some time.</TE>
<TE>   That station's main competitors, KVEA-TV and KWHY-TV, are owned by
the country's second-largest Spanish-language television network,
Telemundo.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Telemundo was purchased by NBC, which promised
cross-promotional news segments. So far, that has worked well.
Bilingual reporters at NBC's Miami affiliate helped host a telethon
on Telemundo last month, and bilingual Telemundo broadcaster Maria
Celeste Arraras hosted a segment on NBC's "Dateline" earlier this
month about conjoined twins separated during a lengthy surgery at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   But the union situation has not gone as smoothly. AFTRA asked NBC
to allow the 36 on-air employees at KVEA and KWHY to organize and
join their English-language counterparts who are already members of
the union.</TE>
<TE>   "The response we've received from NBC was a flat 'No,' " said
Leslie Simon, director of AFTRA's Spanish-language media project,
"but we expect them to reach an agreement with us."</TE>
<TE>   NBC executives said there were no obstacles for Telemundo
employees to organize.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to organize and join the union, we say, 'Get the
requisite number of people in the affected group--the on-air folks.'
Then they vote in a secret election ballot through the National Labor
Relations Board," said Paula Madison, president and general manager

<HD>Striptease, With a Wink</HD>
<DH>At Forty Deuce, the burlesque is performed in good taste
and with a sense of humor. Think: Mae West and '40s pinups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the last decade, Hollywood nightclubs have cranked up the volume
on sex. From such hedonistic adventures as the '90s club Grand Ville,
which popularized the art of seduction with strip shows that appealed
to both men and women, to such burlesque acts as the Pussycat Dolls
and the Velvet Hammer, sex in the city sells. With the addition of
the 6-week-old hot spot Forty Deuce, we've now got the cherry on top
of this saucy scene.</LD>
<LD>   Created by Deep owner Ivan Kane, Forty Deuce offers one of the
sweetest burlesque shows we've had the pleasure of viewing. Unlike
its raunchy relative Deep, which revels in sleaze with go-go gals and
guys bumping and grinding behind see-through walls, Forty Deuce
celebrates striptease as an art form.</LD>
<LD>   Located at the former Kane bar in Hollywood, the original site of
Small's K.O., Forty Deuce is a tiny bar with big ambition. Its
purpose is to titillate without being crass. The nightly burlesque
shows feel like a throwback to a more innocent era. Yes, the girls
strip down, but it's done with a sense of humor, tremendous talent
and in remarkably good taste. The costuming conjures up visions of
Mae West and '40s pinups rather than the prototypical Hustler trash.</LD>
<TE>   It's hard to not fall head over heels for Forty Deuce's headliner,
an Argentine dancer named Carolina (Car-o-leena). Not only can she
dance with an effortless grace, but she does everything with a sense
of fun and frolic, making Forty Deuce feel more like an adult version
of Farrell's than something akin to the Body Shop.</TE>
<TE>   Forty Deuce, designed by Fred Sutherland (who also designed Deep),
feels like the after-party to Hollywood's scene. Despite its size, a
teensy 125-capacity, you don't feel claustrophobic. Essentially,
arrive early, grab a seat and settle in for the night. To be sure
they reserve a spot for you, call in advance for reservations.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it wouldn't be an Ivan Kane bar without "some" sleaze.
Forty Deuce's bathroom doors are painted with the clinical words for
male and female reproductive organs.</TE>
<TE>   But really, that's the only overtly garish element to an otherwise
classy joint.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Forty Deuce is very modern--case in point, a hydraulic
bar that disappears as each show starts so that it can become part of
the stage--the club feels Rat Pack-era loungey. It features plush red
chairs, a 22-foot runway and a beaded red, white and blue stage
backdrop. Deuce's size works to its advantage, making it feel like a
private USO show with you in Bob Hope's seat.</TE>
<TE>   Performances are scheduled for 11 p.m., midnight and 1 a.m., and
the dancers are backed by Joey Altruda's winning jazz combo.</TE>
<TE>   Although the club just made its debut in June, it has already
attracted such regulars as George Clooney, Vince Vaughn and Nicole
Kidman, who's been tapped to perform at an upcoming celebrity charity
striptease. (Va-va-va-voom!)</TE>
<TE>   Kane, who grew up in New York, named the bar after his childhood
nickname for 42nd Avenue. His next moves include opening a Deep in
Las Vegas and a Forty Deuce in New York.</TE>
<TE>   All we can say is: Let the good times roll.</TE>
<TE>   Forty Deuce, 5574 Melrose Ave., Hollywood, (323) 465-4242. Open
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 9 p.m.-2 a.m. 21 and older; $15 cover nightly.</TE>

<HD>A Taste of Hong Kong</HD>
<DH>With its vast menu, Hoy King transports diners to another
bustling city</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoy King Seafood Restaurant may be in Chinatown, but it gives the
feeling of a back street in Hong Kong. The view through the windows
is much the same--storefronts splashed with Chinese characters and
names like Happy Land Co., Nice Chinawares and Ta Chong Co. The
illusion continues inside, as Chinese families, businessmen and women
on shopping excursions crowd around the tables ordering live seafood
and heaps of shiny greens. It's the sort of place where you might see
a waiter carrying a live lobster, claws waving, across the room to
customers who want to examine it before committing themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Non-Asians have discovered it too, drawn by the bargain
combination lunches. The lunch menu offers many choices, and the
combination meals provide good value. (At dinner, when the place is
really packed, there is a grander menu that includes abalone, sea
cucumber and shark's fin dishes.)</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes the lunch dishes are a little rough at the edges. The
decorative carrots in a fish dish, for example, were for looking at,
not eating, because they were made from big, tough carrots. Steamed
eggplant in supreme soy sauce was unevenly cooked, so some pieces
weren't soft. Another dish was marred by tinny canned bamboo shoots.</LD>
<TE>   The kung pao shrimp was scarcely hot--it came in a sweet and sour
brown sauce with onions, bell peppers and just a few dried hot
chiles. On the other hand, the shrimp were large, juicy and
plentiful, and lunch included a tureen of soup (pork broth with a
trace of meat), rice, tea and some orange wedges for dessert. Soups
change from day to day. Another time the tureen might hold bok choy
in a light broth or hot and sour soup.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 60-plus lunch specials you can find scallop, clam, squid
and oyster dishes as well as steamed and fried whole fish, all under
$5. The bill shoots way up when live seafood enters the picture,
though the prices are still moderate: $5.99 a pound for live lobster,
crab or geoduck clam. A lobster will weigh at least 3 pounds. There's
much more shell than meat in both lobster and crab, so without other
side dishes, you may be hungry in a short time, but the restaurant
puts more effort into these dishes than the quick, hearty lunch
dishes, so they are worth the splurge.</TE>
<TE>   One of the prettiest is thinly sliced, boiled geoduck arranged on
a mound of cooked lettuce and decorated with bits of fresh red chile,
green onion and cilantro. A spicy soy sauce dip perks up the bland
clam meat. The restaurant also serves geoduck Japanese style, as
sashimi.</TE>
<TE>   Deep-fried Dungeness crab is a fine, succulent dish. The crab is
broken into pieces, fried and coated with a sauce that includes black
beans, garlic and small red chiles. It's messy to handle, but that's
the price you pay for eating crab in the shell.</TE>
<TE>   Lobster, cut up and fried in the shell, also requires patience in
digging out the meat, but who cares, when the taste is so elegant?
The most popular treatment combines the lobster with green onion tops
and fresh ginger.</TE>
<TE>   Live shrimp are another luxury. Boiled and accented only by the
deep rosy color of their shells, they show off their natural
sweetness. In another presentation, the shrimp are butterflied and
steamed with delicate garlic sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Steamed whole rockfish with ginger and green onions is tender and
light, as only very fresh fish can be. If you don't want to pay for
that caliber of fish, you can order fish filet with vegetables for a
mere $4.25 on a lunch special. I got rock cod in a clear,
well-seasoned sauce that added flavor to the accompanying
vegetable--the bok choy relative choy sum--which contributed an
intriguing bitterness in turn.</TE>
<TE>   Hoy King has expanded since it opened in November. The deli
adjoining the restaurant has been eliminated to enlarge the dining
room and provide additional space for large groups. More room for us
diners, but alas, the plump, glistening soy sauce chicken legs that
looked so tempting there are now only a memory.</TE>
<TE>   Hoy King Seafood Restaurant, 207 Ord St., L.A. (213) 680-1705.
Open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. No alcohol. Street parking. Major
credit cards. Lunch specials, $4.25 and $4.90; dinner for two, $21 to
$56.</TE>
<TE>   What to Get: Boiled geoduck clam, deep-fried crab or lobster,
boiled live shrimp, steamed live shrimp with garlic sauce, seafood
lunch specials such as fish filet with bean sprouts, vegetables or
black bean sauce.</TE>

giant comedic leaps in a single class.</DH>

<AU>ADAM TSCHORN</AU>
<BD>Adam Tschorn is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine being on stage in the dark. The lights come up, and
adrenaline surges.</LD>
<LD>   Then you notice the audience--row after row of strangers.
Watching.</LD>
<LD>   Someone yells "Keys," lighting a fuse that snakes its way around
the stage: car keys, the key to happiness, Alicia Keys, Key West,
West Coast, Coast deodorant soap, soap operas, opera glasses, shot
glasses, buck shot, shot put.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone--there are five of us on stage--scatters. When someone
sits, someone else becomes a chair. Ernest Hemingway wrestles the
pope. Indiana Jones launches into an infomercial. Time collapses in
on itself, and 30 minutes seem to evaporate in a single heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   It's just a typical Wednesday night for my classmates and me at
the ImprovOlympic in Los Angeles, a city that is home to dozens of
schools teaching the art form to a student population that ranges
from Drew Carey and Wayne Brady wannabes to lawyers and
schoolteachers. I happen to be a writer.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you don't relish the idea of getting up on stage in front
of strangers and letting your mind run wild, you might want to check
out an improvisational comedy class or two. Life, as any aficionado
would be quick to point out, is one giant improvised scene. You don't
wake up in the morning with the day's script in hand.</TE>
<TE>   So, unlike last year's voice-over class or pottery class, the
lessons of improv can help you navigate all those unexpected moments
whether you're in the boardroom or the bedroom. And should you decide
to give improv a try, you won't be alone. At any given time, three of
the local schools--the Groundlings, the Second City and ImprovOlympic
West--are training roughly 1,000 students combined.</TE>
<TE>   But wait. If you're making it up as you go along, what do you need
classes for? Think of improv as a Jackson Pollock drip painting--the
stage is a canvas splattered with the accents, mannerisms and
physical characteristics from the palette of each performer. Classes
are designed to show you the different tools.</TE>
<TE>   Formal exercises teach you the subtle effect that each nuance,
emotion and character can have on an improvised scene. They are also
a way to learn the scene structure, listening and communication
skills, agreement and character development that organically move
scenes forward. The games range from the simple (each line of
dialogue must begin with the words "yes and ... ") to the
brain-crushing (an actor must listen and respond to two others who
are talking nonstop; one guy could be ranting about the film "Patriot
Games" while another rambles on about lawn care).</TE>
<TE>   For a first-timer, this sort of 360-degree hyper-perception is
like trying to tap-dance for the first time. You strain. You grasp at
straws. You make mistakes. But before too long, you learn that improv
is a truly optimistic art form. Each mistake, each misinterpretation,
each misstep is an opportunity to be seized on.</TE>
<TE>   Many improv alums describe the experience as Zen-like. "There's
sort of a whole Eastern thing going on," said Jesse Bechtel, 29, an
actor from Sherman Oaks and an ImprovOlympic student. "A whole 'being
in the now' and going with the initial instinct and not editing
yourself." Which seems a sensible strategy since more often than not,
in improv you're dealing with the absurd.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent class, the action required an Amish farmer to dig
a hole in the yard with a small hand shovel. His wife entered and
labeled the "shovel" a "flashlight." Instead of correcting her, the
performer went with it. The shovel became a flashlight. Suddenly he
was embarrassed to be an Amish man using an "electric torch." He
began begging for her forgiveness, and the scene played out in ways
neither could have imagined.</TE>
<TE>   For those who return to classes week after week, there's a turning
point when everything begins to click, and for better or worse you
get a sort of "improv fever." And it's addictive.</TE>
<TE>   I should know. After taking a year's worth of classes at
Groundlings and graduating from Second City's yearlong conservatory
program, I enrolled at ImprovOlympic West to interview students for
this story. My plan was to hang for a few classes and then duck out.
It's been five months, and every Wednesday night I still find myself
drawn to the tiny room above Hollywood Boulevard, free-associating
myself into a sweaty mess.</TE>
<TE>   That first night at ImprovOlympic in March, 16 of us circled on a
postage-stamp-sized stage above the theater. The class was the
standard L.A. assortment of entertainment industry twentysomethings,
wearing jeans, khakis, T-shirts, polo shirts and sneakers. We began
the way most improvisational comedy classes do--by introducing
ourselves around the circle.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first classmates I met was Jack Voorhies, a wiry
25-year-old with a leprechaun grin, boundless energy and a scruffy,
week-old beard.</TE>
<TE>   By day, Voorhies is a purchasing agent's assistant at Archipelago
Botanicals in L.A. He spends his working hours coordinating candle
and shampoo vendors, another faceless paper-pusher in the City of
Angels. In class, untethered from the workplace, he morphs into
everything from an energetic cross-dresser to a doddering old lady at
the copy shop, an unctuous beat cop, a janitor and a singing cabby.
"It's hard to explain," said Voorhies. "It's like this is where I'm
supposed to be. It makes me want to work at it--and I've never wanted
to work at anything."</TE>
<TE>   And Voorhies does work at it. The instructor has barely finished
explaining an exercise when he's a blur of denim and elbows careening
toward the stage. Once there, he is nimble and kinetic. He'll sweep
the floor, wax the car or hike a mountain--sometimes all three in the
space of a single scene. He'll throw anything out to see what sticks.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Voorhies' material turns blue, a world of lecherous men,
clingy women, double-entendres and plain old dirty sex talk. But
Voorhies has one of the most important qualities an improviser can
have: the ability to turn on a dime. In one class, Voorhies crouched
in the back of a canoe and began to paddle furiously upriver. Looking
up, he realized his partner was oblivious to the scene he was trying
to establish. She was right next to him but miles away, standing at
home plate swinging a baseball bat and warming up for a pitch.
Without skipping a beat, he transformed his canoe paddle into a
catcher's mitt. He began to taunt the pitcher. The class erupted into
applause.</TE>
<TE>   "You're just in this moment," said Voorhies, explaining the rush
of the improv experience. "You're there and you're supposed to be
there. It's like when they say relaxation is hard work--it's the same
thing with improv."</TE>
<TE>   Voorhies moved to Los Angeles two years ago to pursue an acting
career. "Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be a star," he said. "I
thought to myself, I don't want to do it the way everybody else does
it. I can be funny on the spot."</TE>
<TE>   So, when he won $4,000 on the game show "Smush," he plunked down
some of that money for his ImprovOlympic tuition. Voorhies spends
about three nights a week at the ImprovOlympic theater--one night in
class, one night as an intern and one night competing in Cage Matches
as part of a group called Midseason Replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Another classmate, Chris Tallman, 31, of Studio City, with tight
curly hair and a slight paunch, looked like a tall version of Scott
Adams' Dilbert minus the fishhook tie. An actor who has appeared on
"The Jamie Kennedy Experiment," "Angel," "Spin City" and "Diagnosis
Murder," Tallman is a skilled improviser who has been at it for
almost half his life.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the most successful improvisers are the ones who don't
have a plan," said Tallman. "You can't go out there with a lot of
stuff because you're going to walk out there and say, 'I'm a giant
robot scientist' and someone's going to say, 'I want to go to the
prom, Dad.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tallman is a master of "space work"--the detailed fiddling with
imaginary objects that helps fill in a scene. A split-second after he
hits the stage, he's silently pulling down imaginary periscopes,
unwrapping imaginary gifts, kicking at imaginary wads of gum stuck to
imaginary sidewalks. On stage, he speaks volumes with a simple nod of
his head or dismissive wave of his hand.</TE>
<TE>   In one scene, Tallman was a member of a dance troupe. When an
overbearing guest choreographer began to yell, Tallman brandished his
"Fosse hands"--palms out, fingers spread wide--and was soon using the
dance move to exorcise him.</TE>
<TE>   While Voorhies and Tallman are using their improv skills to
further an entertainment industry career, Jessica Revill isn't. The
38-year-old is a psychology and education lecturer from Pasadena and
a Groundlings intermediate student. She says the classes help her
lecture students at Cal State L.A. "in a more physical and
spontaneous way." Sometimes she makes her students play improv games.</TE>
<TE>   "When I teach personality to my psych students, I do some of the
exercises like one-word story, where we stand in a horseshoe
semicircle and, like a conductor, I point to people and they have to
co-construct a story. There's no better way to tap into someone's
defense mechanism than doing one-word story. People edit themselves.
They either want to control the story, take it over, or manipulate it
somehow--and it's really interesting to see how and where people trip
up."</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Barr, 33, of Burbank uses improv skills she's learned in
the Second City introductory program at her job. "It makes you a lot
more spontaneous," said the project director at a local graphic
design firm. "A lot of what I have to do involves critiques, seeing
what works and what doesn't. Levity helps in those meetings; it helps
deconstruct things, it helps bring people's barriers down. It makes
people want to throw in ideas."</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere is sort of a preschool for adults, according to
Revill. A way to discover your inner child. "When we're younger,
before the age of 3, we don't tend to edit ourselves," she says. "In
improv, you're allowed to go back to that kind of day-care, in a
sense, a preschool kind of thing; finger-painting,
get-paste-in-every-orifice kind of life--and it's alarming and
freeing."</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who spend our working lives as desk jockeys,
inches from a computer screen, improv represents an opportunity to
let our mental hair down and be in the moment with a group of
like-minded people. And in a town where making dinner reservations
can require industry clout, improv is an equal-opportunity art form
that can help make you a player--or at least make you seem like one.
The only requirements are tuition money and the willingness to leap
into the unknown, trusting that someone will catch you.</TE>
<TE>   You're standing on stage. In the dark. Alone. The lights come up.
Your adrenaline surges. You smile. You've been waiting all week for
this moment. You feel like you can see through walls. You've got that
buzz in your head and the thump in your chest. Tomorrow morning
you'll be back at the office making paper-clip chains and stapling
your desk blotter out of boredom, but tonight you're a Venetian
gondolier paddling through the room. You're a teenager proposing to
your sweetheart on top of a Ferris wheel. You're a telekinetic truck
driver. You've got improv fever.</TE>

<HD>Rules for Improv (and Life)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM TSCHORN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last 2 1/2 years I have taken improvisational comedy classes
at the Groundlings school, Second City and ImprovOlympic West. It
dawned on me that although the intent of the skills and games taught
in these classes was to make me and my classmates better improvisers,
the same rules can be applied to the real world. To paraphrase Robert
Fulghum's bestseller, "All I really need to know I learned in improv
class."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Always make eye contact: In improv, making eye contact with your
scene partner is an important grounding mechanism and a way of
saying, "I'm here and I'm paying attention to you." Try it next time
you meet someone.</LD>
<TE>   It's all about relationships: In improvisational comedy, the heart
of any scene is the relationship between the people on stage. Two or
more people can be golfing on the moon, folding shirts in a J.Crew
store or robbing a bank, but until and unless they establish who they
are to each other and what's happening between them, the audience
won't really care. That's a lot like life: Without the relationships,
there's not much going on.</TE>
<TE>   Trust your partner and take chances: Part of the thrill of improv
is free-falling into a scene knowing that your partner will spin a
safety net to catch you. If you jump, the justification for the
action will always somehow materialize. Just as in real life,
exploring the unknown and taking those chances often yields
unexpectedly wonderful results. As my instructor Paul Vaillancourt
explained it to our Level 2 ImprovOlympic class: "Don't resist the
call to adventure. Stuff only happens when you leave your village and
go out into the wilderness."</TE>
<TE>   Don't use guns: The adage "guns don't kill people, people kill
people" may be true, but an improvised firearm is one of the quickest
ways to kill an improvised scene. The person with the weapon (usually
an index finger jabbing forward, thumb extended skyward) immediately
gains power over the other performers and a scene can quickly become
a one-sided standoff. Unlike in real life, if you do find yourself
with a weapon in a scene, the audience will expect you to use it--so
use it and be done with it. (It's OK--improv jails are much nicer
than real ones.)</TE>
<TE>   There are no mistakes, only opportunities: Improvisational actors
are trained to spot mistakes, acknowledge them and incorporate them
into the scene. If a horn honks outside the theater during a
father-daughter scene, it could become a prom date waiting to take
his firstborn away. A broken drink glass in the audience could be the
sound of a burglar breaking in through a basement window. Having seen
and heard exactly what the actors have, the audience will appreciate
the spontaneity of the responses. In real life this is called
optimism--or faith.</TE>
<TE>   Give gifts: The best way for an improviser to move a scene forward
is to "give gifts" to others--to bestow physical characteristics,
moods or motivations on them. In initiating the gifts, the actor is
focusing on the other person in the scene rather than being stuck in
his or her own head.</TE>
<TE>   Be truthful: In improv comedy, it's the truth that is funny.
Responding honestly and emotionally--whether having a "birds and
bees" talk with a teen or reacting to the news that there is no more
Tang on Moon Base Alpha--will always be funnier.</TE>
<TE>   Don't deny: If your partner walks on stage and accuses you of
stealing her car, agree with her. The natural impulse is to deny
it--after all, it's true that you didn't steal her car, right? Wrong.
In this case, she said you stole her car, so you stole it. To do
otherwise would cause the scene to disintegrate into an argument.
Instead, agree and add some information. "Yes, I stole your car and I
drove it straight off the Santa Monica Pier." Now you've got
something to work with.</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions to every rule: Just as in real life, the
rules of improv comedy can be stretched and even broken when the
circumstances demand it. Monty Python's famous "Argument Clinic"
sketch is the perfect example of an absolutely hilarious scene that
not only breaks the "don't deny" rule above, it is almost complete
denial from beginning to end.</TE>

<LD>Whether you're booking for a spot on the next season of "Saturday
Night Live" or you are an accountant looking to liven up your next
presentation, there is a place in L.A. for you to learn
improvisational comedy. Although the entry-level classes around town
are similar in structure and content, some schools have different
styles and specialties.</LD>
<LD>   L.A.'s Groundlings have been around since 1972, and the emphasis
is on character work. By the second level of classes, students have
created a stable of characters. Paul Reubens created Pee-wee Herman
at the Groundlings, and Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri honed the
Spartan Cheerleaders.</LD>
<LD>   The Groundlings have long been the big man on L.A.'s improv
campus, training thousands over the last 15 years, including Lisa
Kudrow, Chris Kattan and Phil Hartman. As a result, the program is so
popular that the waiting list can stretch a year.</LD>
<TE>   The Second City, the granddaddy of improv education, focuses on
social and political satire. Based in Chicago since 1959, Second City
has fostered such comic minds as John Belushi, Bill Murray, Gilda
Radner and Mike Myers. It has training centers in several cities and
recently marked its second anniversary in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   ImprovOlympic is also a child of the Windy City, co-founded in
1981 by Charna Halpern and David Shepherd. Alumni include Andy Dick,
Andy Richter and Chris Farley. The West Coast branch teaches a
signature brand of long-form improvisation called "the Harold." A
Harold performance cuts between disparate stories and unrelated
characters until they miraculously weave together.</TE>
<TE>   The basics:</TE>
<TE>   The Groundlings offer a single training program for the
professional actor, which consists of four levels: basic,
intermediate, writer's lab and advanced. All students start in basic.
In addition, a separate Introduction to Improv class teaches the
basics of improvisation for the nonactor. Introduction to Improv
meets once a week for six weeks. Basic and intermediate classes meet
either once a week for 12 weeks or twice a week for six. The writer's
lab meets twice a week for six weeks, and the advanced class meets
once a week for 12 weeks. Expect a wait of up to a year between the
upper-level classes. All classes are three hours long. Tuition for
Introduction to Improv is $200. The basic and intermediate classes
are $395 each. The writer's lab costs $475, and the advanced class is
$600.</TE>
<TE>   ImprovOlympic West offers a single training program that consists
of six levels. In addition, ImprovOlympic offers writing workshops,
one-person workshops and beginner and advanced digital shorts
workshops. ImprovOlympic classes meet once a week for eight weeks.
All levels are currently open. Classes are three hours long. Level 1
tuition is $315 and includes the book "Truth in Comedy: The Manual of
Improvisation" by Charna Halpern. Tuition for all other levels is
$300.</TE>
<TE>   Second City offers two tracks of improvisational
training--introductory and conservatory. Both programs consist of
five sessions. In addition, Second City offers a writing program and
a class designed to teach improv techniques to actors. Each Second
City introductory and conservatory program class meets once a week
for eight weeks. There is currently no wait between levels. All
classes are three hours long. Tuition for the introductory program
and Improv for Actors is $300 per term. Tuition for the conservatory
program is $325 per term.</TE>

<HD>Goodell Brings His Aubergine Talents North to Santa Monica</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By any measure, Tim Goodell is one of the Southland's best chefs. But
because he's in Newport Beach, the Orange County native hasn't
received as much exposure as he should here in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Aubergine ends up on too many lists of restaurants to
visit--sometime. Sometime when somebody else is driving, or when a
weekend at the beach is in the offing.</LD>
<LD>   Without a chauffeur or extraordinarily generous designated driver,
the journey back after a multi-course meal with wine can be daunting.</LD>
<TE>   Now Goodell and his wife, Liza, have opened their fourth
restaurant, this one in Santa Monica. Called Whist, this hip
restaurant inside the new Viceroy Hotel is definitely something
different for the Goodells. (They also own Troquet at South Coast
Plaza and Red Pearl Kitchen in Huntington Beach.)</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Kelly Werstler, the rather plain dining room is
trumped by the whimsical retro-glamour of the bar, which sprawls out
into a patio area with two postage stamp-sized pools surrounded by a
series of cabanas. The bar is so thronged, the restaurant can feel a
bit lonely in comparison, especially since the exuberant noise level
reverberates into the dining room.</TE>
<TE>   That's going to change, and soon, because the food, even at this
early stage, is good enough to warrant braving the trendy scene at
the Viceroy.</TE>
<TE>   So many dishes leap off the menu page that eating at Whist becomes
a frustrating exercise if you're only two. Come with a group of
friends to share the marvelous terrine of house-cured foie gras
presented in a French canning jar.</TE>
<TE>   The house-smoked trout with sweet onion tart is a terrific match
with Champagne. A lovely crab cake island floats in a lake of
delicious white corn chowder. In Goodell and chef Jeff Armstrong's
hands, even seemingly simple little starters like Boston bibb salad
take on new luster with a flourish of lemon, avocado and pecorino
cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Among the entrees, duck breast in a caramelized honey glaze
scented with coriander, skate wing cooked on the bone and lightly
smoked, braised, prime short ribs showered with horseradish gremolata
stand out.</TE>
<TE>   Jet-lagged travelers who long for something uncomplicated can
choose steaks, lamb T-bone and double-cut pork chop from a short menu
of broiled dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Sides, most from the realm of comfort food, include a French
grandmother's potatoes au gratin, a soft cloud of polenta and
excellent creamed corn.</TE>
<TE>   Whist is serious, but fun. Pastry chef Shelly Register nudges
things in that direction by offering several desserts for the table
to share.</TE>
<TE>   Before the berry season is over, run, don't walk, preferably with
three or four friends in tow, to try the dreamy trifle.</TE>
<TE>   On the individual dessert front, there's a silky buttermilk panna
cotta garnished with strawberries macerated in balsamic vinegar and a
roasted peach with Oregon blueberries and creme fraiche ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Because Whist is a hotel restaurant, it's also open for lunch and
breakfast. I can't wait to see what Goodell is going to do with that.</TE>
<TE>   Whist, Viceroy Hotel, 1819 Ocean Ave., Santa Monica; hotel (310)
451 8711; restaurant (310) 260-7511. Dinner appetizers, $10 to $18;
main courses, $21 to $34. Open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Full bar. Valet parking.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the Rolling Stones' classic "Street Fighting Man," Mick Jagger and
Keith Richards posed the question, "What can a poor boy do/Except to
sing for a rock 'n' roll band?" Back in 1968, such a choice might
have equaled rebellion. Today, it's merely another item on the
resume.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Who, who famously sang "Hope I die before I get
old," probably never imagined that their music would be taught by
people twice their age. When B.B. King recorded his blues classics,
he probably envisioned them on the charts, not the lesson plan. Yet
both artists' works form the curricula of the Kids Rock Free program
at the Fender Museum of Music and the Arts, where the music of school
dropouts becomes ... well, the music of schoolkids.</LD>
<LD>   If a rock 'n' roll school sounds strange, instructor Virginia Zak
suggests it's just a result of changing times. Recalling the music
industry when she entered it decades ago as a session pianist for MCA
Records, she says, "People had more of an opportunity to just fall
into it. I don't think it's quite the same anymore, but by the same
token, we're profiting by those people's experiences with these
certificate programs. And their knowledge--we're trying to pass that
on. Maybe make it easier for someone."</LD>
<TE>   Zak works now as the keyboard teacher at Southern California's
fastest-growing arts school--an institution where Bach and Muddy
Waters sit together comfortably on the shelf. Since its opening in
1998, the Fender Museum has offered lessons in guitar, piano and more
for kids, ages 7 to 17, who not only want to rock but also want to
learn the tricks of the trade. Apart from its guitar and piano
lessons, the museum is also assembling a technical program for
aspiring producers. As more classrooms open up, rock 'n' roll may be
joined by dance, theater and world music.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, pop history has been full of brilliant amateurs. Elvis
Presley honed his style by listening to local bluesmen; the Beatles,
whom one critic in 1963 labeled the greatest composers since
Beethoven, couldn't even read music. "When I started in the '60s,
there were no schools," recalls Bob Norberg, a mastering engineer at
Capitol Records. "You would just learn by doing it."</TE>
<TE>   When Fender Corp., along with the city of Corona, sponsored the
opening of the Fender, it filled a void in local education. "There
were only three music teachers for 18,000 students in the
Corona-Norco Unified School District, in our immediate service area,"
says Paulyne Becerra, the museum's director of development. "So once
we started the program, it became more evident that there was a huge
need for it."</TE>
<TE>   In its first summer, the Fender started small, with guitar, piano
and drum lessons for 209 students. Two years later, construction
began on a larger site while the classrooms shifted to a private
house owned by the city. Last month, the museum unveiled its new
home: a 33,000-square foot facility with classic guitars and
memorabilia on the ground level and classes and studios upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   Today, more than 400 kids from around the region take classes at
the museum every week. For some, it's the only music training they
can easily afford, with most of the cost picked up by the museum.
Classes are set up in eight-week sessions, with the first two
sessions free. Kids can take as many classes during a session as they
like. After that, the cost is $50 for each additional session. (The
museum funds the remaining $142 per child/per session cost through
grants.)</TE>
<TE>   On a hot August afternoon, instructor Lee Zimmer leads the first
guitar class of the summer. Eight boys, from elementary to high
school age, begin the session by tuning up and practicing scale
patterns. "Do you guys know the blues?" Zimmer asks, and they all
join in a run-through of King's "The Thrill Is Gone," each taking
turns playing the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to keep it fun, but I want to also keep it educational,"
Zimmer explains after class. "The more you know, the more you
understand, and the more you can use--it gives you more tools."</TE>

<LD>* The comedian is the co-host of "The Man Show" on Comedy Central and
the syndicated talk radio show "Loveline." He's also a former
carpenter and boxing instructor.</LD>
<LD>   Goulash: There's a Hungarian restaurant on Ventura in Studio City
called Hortabagy. I order the chicken paprikash and the stuffed
cabbage. People might not normally think to go to a Hungarian place,
but it's really good. Hungarian food is super-hearty. It's just a
bunch of cabbage, dumplings, goulash, sauces and stews, and it's
super-satisfying. For some reason, you always have your choice
between Japanese or Thai or Mexican every night out here, but there's
not enough of that German and Hungarian and Eastern European stuff.
People ought to get more with that. My step-grandfather is Hungarian,
full-blooded, and he would cook goulash, chicken paprikash and all
these layered casseroles, and the stuff was so good that when I
finally found a place out here, I started going to it. I guess when
you are doing Hungarian food, you better be good.</LD>
<TE>   No More Stand-Up, Thank You: I don't like supporting the arts. But
I guess I should mention the Acme Comedy Theater on La Brea, which is
a good place to go for a laugh. I used to work at Acme. They do
sketch comedy. It's like the Groundlings. They are good people and
it's a good show. Though I loathe going to stand-up shows. I never go
to plays. I never go to anything. I did enough of it when I was sort
of starting out. Now that I get paid, I don't want to do it. People
are always like, "Don't you miss the stage, those 99-seat theaters
with the intimate audience and the freedom to express?" and I'm like,
"No, I want my money."</TE>
<TE>   The Cheapest Beer: I have always been into Trader Joe's.
Everything is good there and everything is cheap there. The thing
that I don't understand is that I can go to Trader Joe's and buy a
six-pack of Dos Equis for $3.99, and then I go into some big market
and it's $7.99. There used to be just one Trader Joe's in Sherman
Oaks like 15 years ago, and it was cheaper. They've got all that good
dried fruit, nuts, cheeses and meats. If you don't shop there, you're
an idiot. That's what I'd say about Trader Joe's.</TE>
<TE>   The Model Airplane Crowd: I like to fly model airplanes over at
the Van Nuys model airplane airport in the Sepulveda Basin. It's
embarrassing, but I usually go over there by myself or I'll recruit
some friends to go with me. I have like 20 planes, Spitfires and
Mustangs, and I have had some midair collisions. The people who hang
out there are nice guys for the most part, but it's the kind of guys
you'd picture out there, not a bunch of guys who look like Lorenzo
Lamas with hot girls sitting on the back of their fully dressed hog
waiting for them to finish landing their Cessna. It's more guys who
live the simple life. They're not on the Riviera. I am definitely the
biggest celebrity at this place.</TE>

<DH>Moby and his 'all-time pop hero' David Bowie could not be
more different or better-paired</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Has pop ever had two figures who appear more mismatched than David
Bowie and Moby?</LD>
<LD>   The suave, sophisticated Bowie looks as if he was anointed a pop
star by the heavens. He came into this world with breathtaking good
looks that have defied the aging process, a golden voice, superb body
language and a great tailor. The stylish, three-piece suit he wore
Tuesday at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater looked more expensive than
your average home refinance.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, Moby seems like God's idea of a pop-star joke. He is
a self-described "skinny little geek" who has a barely adequate
voice, and his wardrobe must consist of 25 wrinkled T-shirts and a
pair of jeans.</LD>
<TE>   But this odd couple fused their talents brilliantly in separate
but equally uplifting sets at the Area2 concert Tuesday at
Verizon--sets that showcased their shared abilities to address the
highest aspirations of the human spirit.</TE>
<TE>   There was lots more to see and hear in the day's eclectic,
eight-hour mix of contemporary pop strains, from the colorful antics
of the Blue Man Group and rapper Busta Rhymes' likable if mostly
one-dimensional "put your hands in the air" exercises on the main
stage to a battery of DJ performances in a nearby tent.</TE>
<TE>   But this classic matchup of pop mavericks was the centerpiece, and
Bowie, who came on first, seemed every bit as rejuvenated on stage as
he does on his new "Heathen" album.</TE>
<TE>   Bowie, who once vowed never to perform his old hits live again,
devoted two-thirds of his set to songs that were 20 or even 30 years
old. But the move didn't seem like a surrender to the commercial
reality that fans want to hear the familiar.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that the material, from the icy paranoia of 1975's
"Fame" to the glorious idealism of 1977's "Heroes," still seem fresh,
both because of the quality of the songs and because the Englishman
and his excellent seven-piece band--including longtime sidekicks Earl
Slick on guitar and Mike Garson on keyboards--have rethought most of
them stylistically.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important, the six songs from the new album held their own
in that classy company--reassurance that Bowie remains a vital artist
who's not depending on the oldies to hold fans' attention.</TE>
<TE>   Bowie has always been a formal--as opposed to spontaneous--artist,
at various points in his career acting out numbers in concert with
the ambition and staging of a video.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Broadway-style lights that spelled out B-O-W-I-E above
him Tuesday, he seemed unusually personable and relaxed. Not one for
talk between numbers, he even cracked a couple of corny jokes and
played some wicked air guitar during one tune.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Bowie's music has dealt with themes of obsession and
isolation, and he reflected that tendency Tuesday in his rendition of
the Pixies' "Cactus"--a song with the line, "Bloody your hands on a
cactus tree.../...Wipe 'em on your dress and send it to me."</TE>
<TE>   Whoa!</TE>
<TE>   But the key new songs, including the wistful "Slip Away" and the
delicate "5:15 The Angels Have Gone," touch on a tender, vulnerable
strain that has also run through much of Bowie's music. When he went
into "Heroes," the audience exploded with cheering that suggested
both respect and affection for this veteran figure, whose singing
remains as commanding as ever.</TE>
<TE>   Moby, who has been reviewed here several times in recent years,
more than held his own with a dynamic, fast-paced set that showed him
to be just as daring and as affecting as the man whom he calls his
"all-time pop hero."</TE>
<TE>   Moving between electric guitar, keyboards and congas, the New
York-based artist mixed styles even more freely than Bowie. He not
only crosses genres with his mostly dance-oriented style, but he also
reaches back decades for vocal samples that serve as foundations for
his own new compositions.</TE>
<TE>   He and his musical team, including singer Diane Charlemagne, split
their time mostly between tunes from Moby's 1999 album "Play," and
his new "18." Along with the delirious zest of such numbers as
"Bodyrock" and "Honey," the highlight was the "Heroes"-inspired "We
Are All Made of Stars."</TE>
<TE>   As Moby, who lives near the World Trade Center site, told the
audience, the song is his attempt at post-Sept. 11 solidarity, a
statement of community and comfort that is in the tradition of
Bowie's warmest and most comforting works.</TE>
<TE>   An odd, but essential pair.</TE>

<LD>   Andy Warhol Retrospective--More than a generation after the fact,
it can be difficult to recognize just how revolutionary were Andy
Warhol's paintings of celebrities, tabloid newspapers and commercial
products like Campbell's soup. In the modern history of world
culture, the rejection of a categorical division between high and low
was a singular contribution of American democracy. Warhol's art
declared this truth to be self-evident. At MOCA, the story of how he
did it unfolds in a knockout display. The show is big--more than 250
paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints--and occupies every
gallery of the museum. Happily playing against today's depressing
museum norm, the show includes not one didactic wall label beyond a
four-paragraph introduction. Warhol's art is not about reading text
and promoting the primacy of ideas; it's about the persuasive power
of visual excitement. Warhol sure had it, and the exhibition wisely
defers.</LD>

<LD>* This Mediterranean classic is crunchy and full of flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Cafe Plaka: Here, the usual Romaine lettuce, feta cheese, Kalamata
olives, red onions and cucumbers are dressed with a vinaigrette
flavored with oregano, garlic and secret ingredients. You can also
get it topped with chicken or beef. (Greek salad, $6.25; with chicken
or beef, $9.25.) Cafe Plaka, 18633 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley,
(714) 963-4999.</LD>
<LD>   Delphi Greek Cuisine: There are two Greek salads here, the village

Village salad, $5.95 lunch; $8.85, dinner.) Delphi Greek Cuisine,
1383 Westwood Blvd., Westwood, (310) 478-2900.</LD>
<TE>   Le Petit Greek: The horiatiki salad combines Roma tomatoes,
cucumbers, chopped red onions, feta and Kalamatas, sprinkled with
oregano and extra-virgin olive oil. A variation called the
Mediterranean adds greens, basil and a balsamic vinaigrette. For a
bit extra you can add beef, large grilled shrimp or grilled calamari
to your Mediterranean. (Horiatiki, $7.95; Mediterranean salad,
$12.95; $14.95 with Black Angus beef, $15.95 with shrimp, $13.95 with
calamari.) Le Petit Greek, 127 N. Larchmont Blvd., Hancock Park,

<TE>   Papa Cristos: The salads are rich, extra-crunchy and
bargain-priced at this rustic restaurant-market. The usual sweet Roma
tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce are enriched with red cabbage and a
lot of Greek feta. The dressing (available in the market) is lemon
juice, olive oil, Greek oregano and paprika. (Greek salad, $3.99,
large; $2.89 small.) Papa Cristos, 2771 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles,

shaded by trees, makes a classical horiatiki salad and the Ellinki,
which adds chopped Romaine. Both salads are laced with a (not at all
classical) balsamic vinaigrette. (Salads, $8, lunch; $9, dinner; with
grilled chicken, $13.) Sofi, 8030 3/4 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles, (323)
651-0346.</TE>

<LD>   Osbournes 'Adopt' Orphaned Friend</LD>
<LD>   MTV's first family is expanding: The Osbournes have decided to
take in Robert Marcato, an 18-year-old friend of their two daughters'
who was orphaned last week.</LD>
<TE>   Regan Marcato, a single mother, died from colon cancer--the same
disease Sharon Osbourne is battling.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving him in as part of the family," Sharon told the New
York Post. "He wants to go to drama school, and we're sending him to
the best drama school we can find." Osbourne went on to say that she
bonded with his mother during her medical ordeal. "When I look at
someone like Regan, who didn't have the resources I had," Sharon
said, "what ... have I got to complain about?"</TE>
<TE>   Marcato, who has already been seen on the family's MTV show, will
also be part of next season's episodes.</TE>

<TE>   What do you do when you fail in a 13-year battle to build a
Shakespeare "visitors experience" in the bard's home of
Stratford-upon-Avon, England? Take it to Midland, Penn.--a suburb of
Pittsburgh--of course.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a deal struck in a mere 13 weeks, the $306,000
"Shakespeare's World" will be housed inside a reconstruction of parts
of Stratford and London. Featuring costume exhibits, an electronic
time tunnel and a chessboard with some of the more famous characters,
the project will have professional performers in street productions
of the plays.</TE>
<TE>   That's good news for William Shakespeare Worldwide Ltd., the
company that had incurred the wrath of Stratford legislators fearful
of tourist overload.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a strong sense of irony that this project will be moving
ahead in the U.S. before it comes to fruition in the U.K.," chairman
Kris Kliszewicz told a London newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that if Shakespeare had been alive today, he would have
appreciated this as good source material for another masterpiece."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Pop singer Adam Ant, who rose to fame in the 1980s, pleaded guilty
to wielding a gun in January after London pub patrons ridiculed his
cowboy hat and combat jacket. He'll be sentenced Oct. 2....Showtime
has renewed the critically praised but ratings-challenged "The Chris
Isaak Show" for a third season, ordering 13 new episodes.... Comedy
Central has called an end to the long-running game show "Win Ben
Stein's Money" after next season....Cable's FX channel will present
all 24 episodes of Fox's Emmy nominated series "24" on Labor Day..</TE>

<LD>* Bright Eyes, "Lifted or the Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to
the Ground," Saddle Creek. Normally a CD with a 73-minute running
time and interludes of dialogue and ambient sound would be a red flag
signaling pretension and self-indulgence. But Conor Oberst pulls off
everything in this sprawling, bravura work with ease and command. As
the star of the increasingly prominent Omaha rock scene, Oberst
reflects a Great Plains mentality in the way the album spreads
unimpeded, taking as much time and as many words as it needs to tell
its story.</LD>

<LD>* New this week: "In the Bedroom," actor Todd Field's impressive
directing debut, is an unadorned, unflinching film about fierce and
terrifying passions. It uses exceptional acting from Sissy Spacek,
Tom Wilkinson, Marisa Tomei and others to tell a story of anger and
grief, of grappling with the unthinkable. It's a wrenching narrative,
but because it's told with quiet sureness, with emotions and
personalities that ring true, it pulls us in and does not let go.
That restrained intensity, the film's inherent tone, comes directly
from the excellent short story by Andre Dubus on which it is based.

<DH>The third fantasy, horror festival presents some unusual
and provocative specimens</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't let the titles fool you. Full of movies with such seemingly
random and slightly ridiculous monikers as "The Blood on Satan's
Claw," "The Last Man on Earth," and "Fiend Without a Face" the
American Cinematheque's 3rd Festival of Fantasy, Horror and
Science-Fiction could easily be mistaken as a funhouse junkyard of
sorcery, mayhem and low-rent special effects.</LD>
<LD>   That would be only partially right. The series is shrewdly timed
at the height of summer movie mania, when demographically dumbed-down
marketing assaults often make going to the movies about as much fun
as two hours of being punched in the head. Though the three featured
genres cover a lot of ground, they are united by a subversive
sensibility one might define as "pure film"--utilizing the medium's
dreamlike dislocations to examine the psyche and the soul, to create
far-reaching metaphors for human existence. With aliens, monsters and
tales of possession, the films may look to shock and provoke, but
mostly just to entertain.</LD>
<TE>   Having opened with such relatively polished films as "Star Trek 2:
The Wrath of Khan" and "Jaws," the series moves into different
territory starting tonight with a screening of the first new
35-millimeter print in over 30 years of "Blood on Satan's Claw."
Produced in 1970 by Tigon British Films, a company a step below the
famously tight-budgeted Hammer Films, it is an astoundingly effective
and suspenseful piece of genre filmmaking, rising above its meager
means to become something quite more than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Set in rural 17th century England, the film opens with a farmer
discovering strange remains while plowing his fields. Not quite
human, not exactly animal, the specimen quickly disappears, and just
as fast, the lives of the townspeople are turned upside down. A man
chops off his own hand, the children of the village all go mad, and a
bizarre ritual seems to summon up the devil himself. Though the
special-effects (particularly the papier-mache costume of the Beast)
are sometimes laugh-out-loud bad, the film has a chilling power that
makes it more than worthwhile. Fans of the stagy strangeness of Tim
Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" should not miss this.</TE>
<TE>   Also showing tonight is "The Last Man on Earth," a 1964 Italian
production (in English) starring the great Vincent Price. Based on
the Richard Matheson novel "I Am Legend," the film is a more modest
affair than the long-percolating modern remake (which big names such
as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ridley Scott and Will Smith have flirted
with over the last few years) as it follows the lone survivor of a
vampire plague struggling to continue in the face of desperate peril.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most pensive zombie movies ever made--think Dostoevsky
directed by George Romero--the film is a moving meditation on the
importance of family and the isolation of everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   A different but no less compelling film is 1977's "The Car,"
screening Saturday. Starring James Brolin as a small-town lawman who
must battle a mysterious and murderous automobile that inexplicably
terrorizes the population, the film was directed by Elliot
Silverstein, better known for such westerns as "Cat Ballou" and "A
Man Called Horse." Surprisingly matter-of-fact about the notion that
the car, which has no driver, seems to be a tool of the devil, it's a
gritty, no-nonsense action-shocker with a supernatural twist.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Saturday is "Silent Running," a 1971 combination morality
tale and ecology fable that is among the most finely crafted and
high-minded films in the series. After a nuclear war,
space-freighters carrying the remaining flora and fauna of Earth are
launched into deep space. When they are suddenly ordered to abort
their mission, one of the ship's crew (played by a scraggly Bruce
Dern) takes it upon himself to continue. Sabotaging his shipmates,
and ultimately even sacrificing himself, he does whatever it takes to
see that the beauty of nature, in at least some form, survives.</TE>
<TE>   The directing debut of Douglas Trumbull, best known as the effects
supervisor on "2001: A Space Odyssey" responsible for creating that
film's mind-bending climactic Stargate sequence, the back-to-nature
politics of "Silent Running" may seem innocently naive from our
modern perspective, but overall the film remains astonishing.</TE>
<TE>   It was made in the aftermath of "Easy Rider," when the Hollywood
studios were scrambling to create youth-oriented product. Looking to
cut costs wherever they could, Trumbull and his team shot much of the
film on a decommissioned U.S. Navy aircraft carrier rather than
building their own sets. The miniature work used to create the look
of oversized starships, still impressive today, would go on to
influence the look of "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to believe it was made for barely $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   According to Trumbull's commentary on a recent DVD release,
another influence on that decidedly more well-known film was the
three "drone" robots who accompanied Dern on his journey, progenitors
to R2D2. Trumbull created his machines in an ingeniously simple way.
Inside each costume is a bilateral amputee (meaning someone with no
legs) who can walk on their hands, creating the oddly natural yet
somehow off-kilter feel of the mechanized companions.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the bill on Saturday is 1954's "Fiend Without a Face"
and 1958's "The Crawling Eye." Both titles personify the world of
low-budget, independently produced horror, but "Fiend" is a real
marvel. It's surprisingly talky for much of its running, but once the
invisible monsters are revealed as brains with tails, the fun really
starts. The film's climax--as the "mental vampires" are shot,
stabbed, squashed and vaporized--is as manic and out-there as
anything on screens today.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining films in the series include a number of recent
Japanese anime releases, a selection of classic Russian fantasy films
from Alexander Ptushko, a few Barbara Steele horror titles, and a
screening of Brian DePalma's seminal "Carrie" with cast members Nancy
Allen and PJ Soles scheduled to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, the films of the Festival of Fantasy, Horror and
Science-Fiction deliver more than advertised. And in these dog days
of diminishing returns, that's a special effect, indeed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>El Wine Bar: Restaurateur Steven Arroyo of Cobras &amp; Matadors and
Hillmont is teaming up with Cedd Moses, one of the men behind Liquid
Kitty and 4100 Bar, to open a Spanish wine bar with tapas. The
working title at the moment is Cobras &amp; Matadors Wine Bar.</LD>
<LD>   "We see it as derivative of Cobras &amp; Matadors," says Arroyo. "It
will be a relaxed, casual bar for grown-ups." Arroyo and Moses are
planning on serving 20 Spanish wines by the glass, along with carafes
and sangria. They'll also have a wine list of about 80 wines. Prices
per glass will run from $4 to $12, bottles from $12 to $600.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll keep a lot of the same wines on tap, so that people can
familiarize themselves with Spanish wine," says Arroyo. "They'll be
able to come back and have their favorites."</LD>
<TE>   The wine bar won't serve entrees, just a dozen tapas with a few
bite-size nightly specials thrown in. They've acquired the space of
the now-defunct C bar at Wilshire near La Cienega and plan a complete
renovation: "We're not hiring a designer; we're doing it on our own."
Arroyo and Moses hope to open their bar by Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Small Bites: The first of Koi's planned "sake socials" will run
from 5 to 6:30 p.m. tonight, featuring finger foods and sushi from $4
to $6 a plate along with a varied list of cold and hot sakes. Koi is
at 730 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles, (310) 659-9449.... The
Beverly Hills Hotel celebrates the wines of Firestone Vineyards and
Curtis Winery on Aug. 22 with a tasting dinner hosted by Brooks
Firestone. The reception will begin in the Polo Lounge private room
at 6:30 p.m., followed by a four-course dinner by executive chef
Katsuo Sugiura. Tickets are $95 per person. Reservations are
required; call (310) 281-2919 .... Ruby's, the chain of '40s-style
diners, which began with a single hamburger joint at the end of the
Balboa Pier, is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a traveling
birthday party that visits all of the Ruby's Diners in California and
six other states. The party includes balloons, cake and 82-cent
hamburgers. (Last week, more than 2,130 burgers were sold at the
Irvine location.) Call (800) HEY-RUBY for more information or log

<HD>Documentary Pays Respects to a Hollywood Cemetery's Rebirth</HD>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laemmle Theatres' newest Documentary Days series gets off to a
terrific start with "The Young and the Dead," the story of the
amazing revival of the derelict Hollywood Memorial Park cemetery
under the new moniker Hollywood Forever. "The Young" refers to Tyler
Cassity, the visionary who bought the 62-acre landmark for a mere
$370,000 and devised its comeback with a group of associates, some of
them his friends since seventh grade in Missouri.</LD>
<LD>   "The Dead," of course, refers to the remarkable number of
Hollywood legends resting there in eternity. Cassity may have gotten
the place for a bargain, but what faced him was enormous, so run-down
was the cemetery under the management of its eccentric owner, Jules
Roth (1900-98).</LD>
<LD>   The cemetery has been meticulously restored and turned into a
state-of-the-art operation, encouraging clients to videotape their
life stories or those of their departed loved ones, to be presented
as part of services. As anyone who has attended a funeral at
Hollywood Forever can attest, the video is an enriching experience,
assembled with taste and imagination.</LD>
<TE>   In their repetition, filmmakers Shari Springer Berman and Robert
Pulcini, makers of the memorable "Off the Menu: The Last Days of
Chasen's," tend to let their film become too much of a promotion for
the cemetery, as worthy an endeavor as it is. But this is a
forgivable excess, considering what a warm, respectful and amusing,
when appropriate, portrait they create of Hollywood Forever.</TE>
<TE>   "The Young and the Dead" leaves the impression that Cassity has
not only rescued a major Hollywood landmark, but has done it while
carefully walking a tightrope between showmanship and good taste.
"The Young and the Dead" screens Saturday and Sunday at the Sunset 5
at 10. It will then screen at 11 a.m. Aug. 24-25 at the Monica
4-Plex, (310) 394-9741; Aug. 31-Sept. 2 at the Playhouse 7, Pasadena,
(626) 844-6500; and Sept. 7-8 at the Fallbrook, West Hills, (818)
340-8710.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the films screening at the Egyptian in the American
Cinematheque's third annual Fantasy, Horror and Sci-Fi Festival are
"Bundy" (Sunday at 4 p.m.) and "Viy" (Sunday, following the 6:45 p.m.
screening of Alexander Ptushko's 1952 "Sadko," which the cinematheque
included in its Ptushko tribute last year). "Viy" (1967) was made by
students Georgi Kropachyov and Konstantin Yershov under the
supervision of Ptushko, a special effects maestro, and was adapted
from a short novel by Nikolai Gogol.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Bright's "Bundy" is a smart, crisp and chilling study of
the man for whom the term "serial killer" was coined. Ted Bundy was
arrested in 1978 and ultimately confessed to killing more than 20
women before he was executed in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Well-played by Michael Reilly Burke, Bundy is a Florida State
student who dreams of a career in politics and favors three-piece
suits. He lives with and is supported by his longtime girlfriend, Lee
(Boti Ann Bliss), a single mother with a large, comfortable home. An
airhead and a nag, Lee is crazy about him and increasingly eager to
tie the knot.</TE>
<TE>   Ted is not a guy who handles pressure well, and soon he is
stalking young women to rape and murder. He grew up in poverty,
learning at age 5 that his sister was really his mother, and at 17,
that his father was not really his father. But can this background
and Lee's nagging be enough to set off a rage-consumed serial killer?</TE>
<TE>   Bright seems to be cramming as many graphic killings as he can in
98 minutes. Yet he leaves us in the dark as to what is driving Bundy.
To all of Bundy's rampaging, Bright takes an absurdist tone that
suggests he may regard such questions as beside the point.</TE>
<TE>   Ptushko's enchanting "Viy" seems faithful to its folkloric source.
While on a Lenten vacation with fellow seminarians, Khoma Brutus
(Leonid Kuravloyv) finds shelter in an old woman's barn only to
discover that she is a witch. As Khoma beats her in anger, she turns
into a beautiful young woman (Natalya Varley). Before she dies, she
tells her grief-stricken father, Sotnick (Aleksei Glazyrin), to
summon Khoma to pray for her soul for three nights. What lies in
store for poor Khoma is magical, scary and ultimately enigmatic. The
Egyptian is at 6712 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>

<TE>   The Malibu International Film Festival, which runs Friday through
next Thursday at the New Malibu Theater, 3822 Cross Creek Road, will
present 10 p.m. screenings Saturday and next Thursday of Mark Anthony
Galluzzo's clever suspense thriller "R.S.V.P."</TE>
<TE>   Set in a Las Vegas high-rise apartment, "R.S.V.P." stars Rick Otto
as Nick, a perennial student, told by a friend that he is
overeducated and under-ambitious. Indeed, all of his friends are
graduating except him, and he decides to throw a party in
celebration. Nick, a philosophy major, is an essentially ineffectual
man who intends that none of his 11 guests leave the apartment alive.
How Nick attempts to pull this off is diabolically clever, and how
well he succeeds becomes a matter of increasing suspense. (310)
452-1180.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Filmed in a Hollywood Hills home called the Castle, which Andy
Warhol rented for his L.A. visits, "Imitation of Christ" (1967) takes
its title from the 15th century Thomas a Kempis treatise, said to be
the favorite reading of the film's star, Patrick Tilden-Close, a
troubled youth who had, in fact, been a child actor. "Imitation of
Christ" will be shown Wednesday at the Egyptian, after the 7:30 p.m.
screening of the unavailable-for-preview "The Closet" (1965) as part
of MOCA and the American Cinematheque's Andy Warhol Does Hollywood
series. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Opening a regular run Friday at the Music Hall in Beverly Hills is
Iraj Karimi's "Going By," which cuts back and forth among four cars
driving north from Tehran to the Caspian Sea. (310) 274-6869.</TE>

<HD>Reaching Back for Flamenco Tradition</HD>
<DH>Caminos Flamencos beguiles in innovative experiments from
the genre's 'Golden Age.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So much of contemporary flamenco expresses the emotions of the
performer through a limited range of traditional musical formats that
a program highlighting neglected older relationships between flamenco
music and dance represents a valuable project in artistic
reclamation.</LD>
<LD>   The premiere of "Desde Cadiz Pa Aca," (From Cadiz to Here),
Tuesday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, took the New World Flamenco
Festival back to what a program note called "the Golden Age of
flamenco in the 1940-1960s."</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, flamenco specialists could best appreciate the
innovation in this experiment by dancer-choreographer Yaelisa and her
San Francisco-based company, Caminos Flamencos. But even the general
dance audience could find deep pleasure in the lilt, charm and
refinement of the performance.</LD>
<TE>   Like Cadiz, Spain, itself--intimate, elegant, bathed in gleaming
reflected light from the water that nearly surrounds it--the
beguiling sensuality of the old/new song styles cast its spell.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening "Caracoles," for example, four women in sleek black
gowns stretched and glided to music of disarming sweetness and
composure as performed by guitarist and company music director Jason
McGuire, with guest singers Silverio Heredia and Miguel Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Rapid shifts of position and flurries of percussive footwork
tested the women's technique--especially when Yaelisa joined them
later. But their dancing style stayed relaxed, sociable, vibrant yet
uninsistent. These qualities became developed further in Yaelisa's
celebratory "Cantinas" solo, so fleet, light and spirited, with
walking steps that evoked the image of a supremely confident young
woman strolling along one of Cadiz's antique, honey-colored
promenades.</TE>
<TE>   In "Romeras," company guest Juan Ogalla proved a master of
building complex rhythmic edifices from insinuating step patterns and
then demolishing them with a sudden eruption of contorted jumps,
turns and kicks. His best dancing all evening came in a passage of
dazzling intricacy here, accompanied only by hand clapping and the
use of the guitar as a toneless strum-drum. But he also adroitly
traded steps with Yaelisa in their teasing, mock-confrontational
"Cana" duet and the festive finale.</TE>
<TE>   Yaelisa and Ogalla also ventured flamenco solos in more familiar
styles near the end of the program. "Solea" found Ogalla initially
doubling the guitar flourishes with his feet and staying closely tied
to the accompaniment. But for all his expressive power, stamina and
technique, he dulled his best dancing here through dogged repetition.</TE>
<TE>   "Siguiriyas" called from Yaelisa not only great depth of
feeling--the emotions pulled into her torso and weighing it down--but
great dynamic variety in her footwork and a superb boldness of
attack. A passage to stamping and clapping had a special fervor, and
as always, her hands embellished her dancing with ravishing delicacy.</TE>
<TE>   McGuire's solo managed to be atmospheric and fiendishly complex at
the same time, with the Barclay's inescapable amplification seeming
more subtle than the New World festival norm last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Like Ogalla, the two singers came from Cadiz for this project,
characteristically alternating within a song and thus tracing an arc
from Heredia's husky tone to Gonzalez's brighter, more piercing
vocalism. Their authority in this material, of course, could not be
greater, so Yaelisa's adventure in flamenco time travel had both
novelty and absolute surety to recommend it.</TE>
<TE>   In its creative stance, her program stood midway between the
conventional dance drama of Juana Amaya that opened the 2002 series
and the radical modernism of firebrand Andres Marin that will close
it Friday through Sunday. It showed us more about flamenco than we
may have previously known, but as always, confirmed the art's
legendary fusion of technique and feeling, sophisticated form and
primal content.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the performers previously credited, the Tuesday
performance featured the dancing of Alicia Adame, Juliana Drechsel,
Defne Enc and Liza Thomson.</TE>

<HD>In This 'Betrayal,' Are They Really Friends?</HD>
<DH>An earnest revival of the Pinter play is undercut by the
age differences in seeming contemporaries</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harold Pinter's rigorous dissection of an extramarital affair,
"Betrayal," is under the microscope in Pacific Resident Theatre's
tiny second space.</LD>
<LD>   The most unusual aspect of Tom McDermott's staging is that the two
men in the play's romantic triangle look about a decade apart in age,
even though they're supposed to have been best friends going back to
their mutual university days.</LD>
<LD>   Robert (Richard Fancy) looks as if he's in his mid-50s, and Jerry
(Stephen Hoye) in his mid-40s. Of course, men from somewhat different
eras can become friends, but there's little evidence that there ever
was much fraternal intimacy between these two. It feels like a mere
business acquaintanceship, which diminishes the play's point that the
betrayal is between the two men as much as between the marrieds.</LD>
<TE>   Suzanne Ford's Emma, who is Robert's wife and Jerry's lover, looks
younger than both of the men, perhaps in her mid-30s. Because of her
age and the discrepancy in the men's ages, it's easy to imagine that
she finds the younger Jerry more compatible, and that she has long
doubted the wisdom of having married Robert--not only because he's a
cold fish, but also because he's from a different generation. So for
this particular purpose, the age differences make sense, though it's
probably not what Pinter intended.</TE>
<TE>   Age issues aside, the performances are very good. Fancy appears to
have a sneer surgically implanted on his face as well as in his
voice. Hoye and Ford are both skilled at delineating the difference
between the dead air at the end of their affair and their earlier
irrational exuberance. Chris McCabe plays the small role of a waiter
with a sense of style.</TE>
<TE>   The action generally moves from the end of the affair back toward
the beginning--although there are a couple of scene transitions that
briefly reverse that pattern. So the most passionate scene is at the
end, and the turning point of the affair--in a scene set in
Venice--is the play's centerpiece. The play's fictional events
loosely parallel those of an affair that Pinter had with English TV
personality Joan Bakewell during the '60s, according to Pinter
biographer Michael Billington.</TE>
<TE>   "Betrayal" covers eight years in nine scenes that are set in seven
locales. Not surprisingly, this creates lengthy blackouts between
scenes in theaters like this one, where everything is moved by hand.</TE>
<TE>   But this production fills the gaps admirably with Keith
Stevenson's rich mix of recorded music that fits the play's shifting
moods, from Miles Davis to blues to opera. John Berger designed the
spare but effective set.</TE>
<TE>   "Betrayal," Pacific Resident Theatre, 705 1/2 Venice Blvd.,
Venice. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. (310) 822-8392.
$20-$23.50. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Mahler's Songs Speak Louder Than 'Zarathustra'</HD>
<DH>Baritone Thomas Quasthoff and mezzo Lilli Paasikivi make
notable Bowl debuts</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For all the bombast of its famous opening, Richard Strauss' "Also
Sprach Zarathustra" (Thus Spake Zarathustra), inspired by Friedrich
Nietzsche's famous philosophical overview of the human race, is not
an unnuanced celebration of the Superman. The German philosopher's
concept of this most evolved of creatures was as a reclaimer of moral
values. And in his half-hour tone poem, Strauss interprets
Nietzsche's concept of a will to power as an elemental and
ever-ongoing struggle between humanity and nature. The score ends
quietly, indeterminately, wisely uncommitted to one side over the
other.</LD>
<LD>   Still, under it all, the uglier side of the Superman, which the
Nazis interpreted as the blond, muscled Aryan hero, also lurks,
especially if one ponders Strauss' own later enigmatic dalliance with
the National Socialist Party. A listener caught only the faintest
hint of that gauche golden giant in Esa-Pekka Salonen's sleek,
steely, Modernist interpretation of "Zarathustra," which opened the
Los Angeles Philharmonic program at the Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday
night. But it was there, and it was enough to make the Bowl debut of
German baritone Thomas Quasthoff--who was a soloist, along with the
Finnish mezzo-soprano Lilli Paasikivi, in songs from Mahler's "Des
Knaben Wunderhorn" (The Youth's Magic Horn)--all the more striking
and meaningful.</LD>
<TE>   Had Quasthoff been born while the Nazis were in power, he might
not have survived given his thalidomide-induced deformities. But in
the world of music, it is hard to think of a more effective example
of the triumph of man over nature, the triumph of the will. Quasthoff
is a great singer. He has a commanding, beautiful voice. He has the
rare quality of bringing every word he sings to vivid life. He is a
wondrously expressive stage presence.</TE>
<TE>   Most extraordinary of all, he has that rare Sinatra-like ability
to make you think that he is singing to you alone. And talk about the
Nietzschean will to power, he even managed the Sinatra trick across
the expanse of the Hollywood Bowl, amplification and all.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the programs for the Philharmonic's upcoming European
tour, the conjunction of the Strauss symphonic poem and the Mahler
songs is obviously intended to be intriguing. The two works were
written within a few years of each other at the end of the 19th
century by young composers who knew each other, were both influenced
by Nietzsche, were both considered avant-garde at that time. But
their temperaments were hardly compatible. The affable Strauss wrote
in his diary that there was hope since the "Jew Mahler could still
find elevation in Christianity." The neurotic Mahler called Strauss
"the great opportunist."</TE>
<TE>   Strauss' "Zarathustra"--especially when its protagonist, the
prophet Zoroaster, comes down from the mountain and finds his
pleasure in the homey Viennese waltz style--can seem faintly silly.
But it contains sensuously complex writing for the orchestra, and a
bewitching harmonic ambiguity. Salonen emphasized these bold,
ambiguous, complex qualities in a performance that could only
partially work at the Bowl. The rumble of a small plane drowned out
the low instrumental rumble at the beginning and the amplification
did unpleasant things to winds and brass and hardened string tone.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Zarathustra," the dozen Mahler songs, which are based on
often-macabre German folk tales, underscore the Nietzschean
preoccupation with humanity's relationship to the natural and
supernatural worlds. But Mahler was far more fatalistic than the
easygoing Strauss and his sense of irony considerably more developed.</TE>
<TE>   It is maybe a little unfair that Strauss on Tuesday didn't have
the advantages of Quasthoff or Paasikivi, an impressively lustrous
mezzo who was making her American debut on this occasion. Both
singers were simply ideal. Whether bringing chills to the spine with
his eerie tra-la-las in a march of dead soldiers, hilariously
animating the he-haws of an ass, or picturesquely describing the
quirks of St. Anthony preaching to the fish, Quasthoff easily seized
the dramatic essence of each song.</TE>
<TE>   In the numinous "Urlicht" (Primeval Light), a song about
transcending mortal pain, Quasthoff created one of those exceedingly
rare spellbinding moments of stillness, where music and the immensity
of the sky actually do make this normally troublesome venue a magical
bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Paasikivi's debut was also of note. There are many fine mezzos
these days, but there can never be too many. Most of her songs were
those with dark emotions, and her lush intensity and warmth seemed to
particularly play off the lavish colors of Mahler's orchestral
writing. The Philharmonic, aglow under Salonen, clearly knew, with
such singers, it could do no less.</TE>

<HD>Remembering Elvis at His Best (and Worst)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elvis has gone digital. Because Friday is the 25th anniversary of
Elvis Presley's death of a heart attack at age 42, several
documentaries and his vintage films were released this week on DVD to
commemorate the anniversary.</LD>
<LD>   The highlight is "Elvis: The Great Performances," a Rhino Home
Video three-disc set ($20 each or $50 for the set), featuring three
documentaries from producer Andrew Solt.</LD>
<LD>   "Center Stage" features Elvis in 13 hip-swiveling musical numbers,
including "Hound Dog" on "The Milton Berle Show" on June 5, 1956. You
can also watch the performances with a special trivia tract.</LD>
<TE>   The same extras are also available on "The Man and the Music,"
which features 14 musical numbers from TV and movies.</TE>
<TE>   Bono narrates the final documentary, "From the Waist Up," which
originally aired on VH1. Although there are some overlaps, this disc
features a heap of hep Elvis performances, such as "When My Blue Moon
Turns to Gold Again" from Jan. 6, 1957, on "The Ed Sullivan Show."</TE>
<TE>   One of Elvis' greatest friends was Diamond Joe Esposito. The two
met in the Army in Germany in 1958; he was best man at Elvis' wedding
to Priscilla Presley in 1967 and also tried to save Elvis on the day
he died. Now he is the host of "Elvis: His Best Friend Remembers"
(Universal, $10 on VHS; $15), a homey but rather mundane look at the
man behind the myth.</TE>
<TE>   The best part of the DVD is the 30 minutes of additional footage
that features interviews with Elvis impersonators, the world's
biggest Elvis fan, and the man who came up with the phrase "Elvis has
left the building."</TE>
<TE>   Universal is also releasing Elvis' last fictional film, the
painfully bad 1969 musical drama "Change of Habit" ($15). In this
outing, Elvis plays a doctor working in the slums of New York. Mary
Tyler Moore plays a nun who arrives with two other sisters to help</TE>
<TE>   Fox Home Video pays tribute to Elvis with the release of three of
his early films on DVD ($20): "Love Me Tender," "Wild in the Country"
and "Flaming Star."</TE>
<TE>   In the first, from 1956, Elvis sings such hits as "Love Me Tender"
and "Poor Boy." He plays a Southerner who stayed home during the
Civil War and ended up marrying his brother's (Richard Egan) fiancee
(Debra Paget).</TE>
<TE>   Elvis goes dramatic with pretty good results in the 1960 western
"Flaming Star," in which he plays the half-Native American,
half-white son of a rancher. Barbara Eden, Steve Forrest, Dolores Del
Rio and John McIntire also star. It was directed by the
always-dependable Don Siegel.</TE>
<TE>   "Wild in the Country" (1961) finds Elvis playing a high-strung
country boy who finds himself facing manslaughter charges in this
overheated drama penned by Clifford Odets. Tuesday Weld, Hope Lange
and Millie Perkins play the women in his life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If your tastes run more to horror and sci-fi, three new releases
are worth a peek.</TE>
<TE>   Bela Lugosi plays a suave vampire who haunts London during World
War II in the 1944 "The Return of the Vampire" (Columbia TriStar,
$20). Also new from Columbia TriStar is the 1957 double feature of
"Curse of the Demon" and "Night of the Demon" ($25). The former is
the 82-minute U.S. version of the thriller, which was recut from the
original 95-minute British release, "Night of the Demon." Although
the "Demon" of the title looks threadbare today, the subtle,
atmospheric story of a devil cult packs an eerie punch. Director
Jacques Tourneur does a terrific job building suspense.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Home Video has just released the digital edition of the
enjoyable 1954 sci-fi flick "Them!" ($20). James Whitmore, Edmund
Gwenn, James Arness and a pre-"Davy Crockett" Fess Parker star in
this flick, which is far classier than most of the '50s horror films.
It's about giant ants hiding out under L.A. sewers. The DVD features
archival footage on how the ants were created and operated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The intelligent British drama "Last Orders" (Columbia TriStar,
$25) stars a powerhouse cast: Michael Caine, Tom Courtenay, Ray
Winstone, Helen Mirren, Bob Hoskins and David Hemmings. The poignant
story traces a group of friends' final send-off for a beloved leader.
The DVD includes commentary from writer-director Fred Schepisi, who
offers nice insight into the making of the film.</TE>

<HD>Ojai Shakespeare Fest Turns 20 With a 'Night' of
Celebration</HD>
<DH>A giddy production of an old favorite enlivens the Libbey
Bowl. Also, New West Symphony goes Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It must be a rite of summer by now, catching the Bard in Libbey Park
courtesy of the Ojai Shakespeare Festival--an adventure now running
20 years. In a celebratory spirit, this year's presentation--playing
through this weekend--is "Twelfth Night," the ever-popular comedy in
which aristocrats behave foolishly and fools temporarily rule.</LD>
<LD>   The production, an ideal summertime treat, may be a good vehicle
through which to introduce young people to Shakespeare. Blended into
the fanciful language and romantic and philosophical asides is bawdy
humor and enough scenic variety to evoke a much larger range of
issues. Scott Siedman's resourceful set design depicts a
Moroccan-esque desert scene, a ship and Lady Olivia's home.</LD>
<LD>   Julie Christensen, best known for her singing but whose thespian
side is getting more attention lately, is alternately sassy and regal
as Olivia. She is the pivot around which much of the play's mistaken
identities, misdirected lusts and merry prankstering revolve. Jaye
Hersh, the festival's artistic director, is, ironically, a pillar of
solidity in the double role as Viola masquerading as Cesario. It's
that kind of a narrative puzzle.</LD>
<TE>   Other standouts include Geoff Foley as the conniving Sir Tobey
Belch and Richard Winterstein, who put in a memorable performance
last year as Falstaff in "Falstaff: The Apprenticeship of Good Prince
Hal." That was directed, like this production, with fetching clarity
by John Slade. As Malvolio, the hapless pawn in a cruel game,
Winterstein lavishly dons yellow tights and mugs with the proper
degree of abandon, suggesting that he's "mad in his wits."</TE>
<TE>   (Note: Winterstein's son Travis, 15, is also in the festival this
year, playing Prospero in the festival's secondary production--which
stars interns--of "The Tempest," tonight at 8 and Saturday and Sunday
at 4 p.m.)</TE>
<TE>   All the giddy entanglements of "Twelfth Night" achieve resolution
by the end, as "the whirligig of time brings his revenges" and the
right liaisons are at last made. As usual, the festival makes
Shakespeare work outdoors, drawing on a careful mix of polish,

pianist Ying Zhang. On the program is music by Bizet, Chopin and
Saint-Saens, in the first live piano concert in this new venue, built
to house the Oscars.</TE>

<TE>   Art Pack: Diversity is the meat and the meaning of the annual
Merit Award Show at the Buenaventura Gallery. The work of some two
dozen artists, juried from their work over the past year, have been
gathered into the main gallery.</TE>
<TE>   In the show, the contrasts build into a statement about artistic
individuality. John Sidman's mixed-media masks, "Three Faces," exudes
ritual charm, in contrast to Irene Jablonski's nice, loosely rendered
portraits. Lee Hodges' collage, "I Am," leaves its intentions open
through a meld of symbols and images, and Carlisle Cooper's
recognizable figurative painting style, with its hyperbolic, radiant
gleam, is evident in "Masquerade No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Rhoads' deceptively mild-mannered "Connie Painting" is art
about an artist enveloped in natural awe. Lisa Marshall focuses her
attention on small, vibrant paintings of dinnerware and critters. And
Roland "Ray" Harding twists convention in his own way with "Big
Yellow House Gum Balls," a super-realist graphite drawing, whose
warped perspective on the world seen through a spherical glass
reflects a sense of healthy, artistic otherness, in a sometimes
too-rational world.</TE>
<TE>   * Merit Award Show, Buenaventura Gallery, 700 E. Santa Clara St.,
Ventura. Hours: Tuesdays-Saturdays, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Ends Aug. 24.

<HD>Agere to Exit Optical Electronics, Cut Jobs</HD>
<DH>Technology: Company says it plans to eliminate a third of
its work force as it focuses on supplying integrated circuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Communications component maker Agere Systems Inc. will attempt to cut
its losses in a lackluster telecommunications market by eliminating
more than a third of its work force--about 4,000 jobs--and quitting a
business that accounts for about 10% of its revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Agere, a spinoff of Lucent Technologies Inc. based in Allentown,
Pa., announced Wednesday that it was getting out of the optical
electronics business, which makes equipment that controls fiber-optic
systems.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, it will focus on its main revenue generator, supplying
integrated circuits that access, move and store network information
for components including telecommunications hardware and desktop
computers, said John Dickson, president and chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   Shares rose 12 cents to $1.69 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The job cuts will shrink the company's work force from about
11,200 to about 7,200 by the end of next year. That's down from
18,500 workers in March 2001. Three months later Agere announced it
would cut 4,000 jobs in the first in a series of reductions.</TE>
<TE>   Agere said it will seek a buyer for its optoelectronics unit and
plans to be out of that business by June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The company said market research indicated optoelectronics revenue
industrywide is expected to be about $2.3 billion this year, down
sharply from $7 billion in 2000, due to excess capacity in current
networks and delays in moving to higher-speed systems.</TE>
<TE>   The weakness is pronounced in long-distance phone systems that
provide the main market for Agere's optoelectronics components,
Dickson said, adding that demand isn't expected to rebound until 2004
or 2005.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Rebound After Weak Start</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Treasury yields tumble to 40-year lows before
resurging. Dow is up 260 points, and Nasdaq gains 65.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks resurged Wednesday as buyers poured back into the market after
Tuesday's sell-off.</LD>
<LD>   In the bond market, yields on Treasury issues dived to 40-year
lows by midday, then sharply rebounded. Corporate junk bond yields,
meanwhile, neared 10-year highs--a sign of investors' continuing
jitters about the economy.</LD>
<LD>   It all made for another volatile day on Wall Street. And analysts
warned to expect more of the same.</LD>
<TE>   "This market is going to continue to test our patience," said
Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at brokerage RBC Dain
Rauscher in Minneapolis. "One day it seems like the world is coming
to an end, the next day we're OK."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 260.92 points, or 3.1%,
to 8,743.31, and the tech-oriented Nasdaq composite surged 65.02
points, or 5.1%, to 1,334.30.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 jumped 4%.</TE>
<TE>   All three major indexes notched their best gains since July 29, as
winning stocks topped losers by 5 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Beaten-down technology, financial and retail stocks led the rally,
and trading volume was active.</TE>
<TE>   Dain Rauscher's Dow said investors may have viewed Tuesday's
sell-off, which followed the Federal Reserve's decision to leave its
key interest rate unchanged, as unwarranted. "I think the market
realizes rates are low enough," Dow said. "There's enough fuel
already in place for an economic recovery."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Fed said it is aware that the recovery has
weakened in recent months, and indicated it could ease credit further
in the fall if the economy appears to be sliding back into recession.</TE>
<TE>   Reassuring news in the retail sector, where Nordstrom beat
quarterly earnings estimates and Wal-Mart Stores boosted its share
buyback program a day after its strong profit report, also gave
stocks a lift, Dow said.</TE>
<TE>   Nordstrom gained $1.21 to $18.44, and Wal-Mart leaped $3.91 to
$52.62.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks also may have benefited from relief that more earnings
restatements did not precede the Securities and Exchange Commission's
deadline Wednesday for the heads of big firms to certify their
financial results, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   A shift by institutional investors away from government bonds and
into stocks added punch to the rally as well, after Treasury yields
dived Tuesday as the Fed conceded the economy has slowed.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year T-note yield, which sank to a 40-year low of 4.09%
Tuesday, briefly dropped below 4% Wednesday, which may have triggered
so-called asset allocation trades out of bonds and into stocks by
pension funds and other large players. The benchmark yield ended the
day at 4.12%.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year T-note yield rebounded to 2.15% on Wednesday from
1.97% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   For big investors, "almost all their models are saying it's time
to rebalance to equities," Dow said, with the S&amp;P 500 down 20% year
to date.</TE>
<TE>   While investors have snapped up Treasury debt in the last week,
however, they have continued dumping corporate bonds, especially junk
issues. That reflects worries that the economy may continue to
weaken, further hurting companies' creditworthiness, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Creditworthiness is under siege sector by sector," said Jerry
Paul, a hedge fund manager at Quixote Capital Management in Denver.
"Now it's airlines, but we've seen it with energy, cable and just
about everything else. It's not just telecom anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The yield on KDP Investment Advisors' index of 100 junk bonds
climbed to 12.28% from 12.21% Tuesday, and is the highest since
December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Access to capital is an increasing concern for corporate America,
analysts say. "Investors are going to wait to see that [corporate]
earnings really have turned around before they extend credit again,"
said John Puchalla, economist at Moody's Investors Service.</TE>
<TE>   A spate of credit-rating downgrades is adding to the air of
concern. Puchalla said there have been 14 "fallen angels"--companies
downgraded from investment grade to "junk" status--so far in the
third quarter, on pace to top the record 23 in the first quarter of
2001. Such downgrades make corporate borrowing far costlier.</TE>
<TE>   Paul said extreme caution among bond investors, bankers and
corporate leaders--who would rather pay down debt than borrow to
expand their businesses--could spell trouble for the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not in the 'double dip' recession camp, but the impact is
going to be that economic growth is slower than expected," he said.
"Appropriate as well as inappropriate debt is being curtailed, which
could have long-term effects."</TE>

<HD>Publisher, Parent Just Weren't on Same Page</HD>
<DH>Media: Fourtou rescinds pledge to keep the unit. Analysts
say books don't mesh well with other parts in a conglomerate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN and MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier anointed
Curious George as the company mascot last year, linking the French
utility company he was struggling to remake into a media giant and
George's owner, Houghton Mifflin, the publishing company Vivendi had
just acquired.</LD>
<LD>   Trouble is, that was the extent of any "synergy" between Houghton
Mifflin and Vivendi.</LD>
<LD>   Now that the French firm is under pressure to raise $9.8 billion
to pay off its mounting debt, George and his Boston-based publisher
have "For Sale" signs hanging around their necks.</LD>
<TE>   Faced with a fast deteriorating financial situation, Messier's
successor, Jean-Rene Fourtou on Wednesday reversed his 2-week-old
pledge to keep Houghton Mifflin within Vivendi, revealing perhaps a
lack of direction if not conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, it's unclear whether the sale is part of a broader
strategy--or just desperation. Equally uncertain is the future of
Vivendi's European publishing unit or whether there are buyers for
Houghton Mifflin, considered a publishing gem.</TE>
<TE>   This much, however, is increasingly clear: Book publishing is a
distinct business that operates independently from other media
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the tendency to lump books in with all things media,
analysts and industry executives say there is little evidence that
pairing publishing with movie studios, television networks and music
companies adds up to more than just a simple sum of the parts.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumer publishing has virtually nothing to do with the other
aspects of the media industry," said Veronis Suhler Stevenson analyst
Bob Broadwater. Added an industry executive: "It's a nice adjacent
business. But it's not vertically integrated into the rest of the
parts."</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's analyst Harold Diamond said, "The strategy that
appeared very good on paper three or four years ago is not playing
out."</TE>
<TE>   It's not a knock on books.</TE>
<TE>   There can be significant fluctuations in year-to-year sales, but
the book industry traditionally experiences steady but slow long-term
growth, said Broadwater.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer publishing is a $17.9-billion industry, growing an
average of 2% to 3% a year. Textbooks, which operate as a separate
business, is a $7.6-billion industry that has enjoyed higher growth
rates recently, as much as 8% annually. But it is expected to slow
down as the economy takes a bite out of state and local education
spending.</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin, strong in both categories with $1 billion in
annual revenue, reflects those overall industry trends, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "It dominates K-12 and has a very attractive testing division,"
said Martin Maleska, an expert on educational publishing with
Veronis. "From all reports, Houghton Mifflin is doing well."</TE>
<TE>   Its consumer books division is far smaller, but a strong performer
as well, according to Veronis.</TE>
<TE>   "What you want is a small, high-quality backlist of books everyone
has to read," Broadwater said. "And that's what Houghton has."</TE>
<TE>   Sales of its "Lord of the Rings" series, goosed by the recently
released movie, he said, "gave them a big pop."</TE>
<TE>   Still, buyers willing to pay the $1.7 billion it cost Vivendi to
buy Houghton Mifflin may be scarce. It's a terrible climate to try to
sell anything, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough," said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst
Brandon Dobell. "Besides, the biggest textbook publishers
[McGraw-Hill, Reed Elsevier, and Pearson] will face antitrust
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Viacom Inc.-owned Simon &amp; Schuster as well as News Corp.'s
HarperCollins unit are considered potential buyers, if the price is
right.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann, which owns Random House and dominates the U.S.
consumer publishing industry, also is considered a potential buyer
for at least some of Houghton Mifflin's assets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the book business to stay. It has its ups and downs but
we're very optimistic about the long-term prospects," said Random
House spokesman Stuart Applebaum.</TE>
<TE>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>At a Glance</TE>
<TE>Houghton Mifflin, based in Boston, was an independent book publisher

*Revenue: $1.03 billion in 2000. Vivendi does not break revenue out
separately, but the company says it has continued to have revenue of about
$1 billion a year.

<HD>Federated Stores Latest to Join Myanmar Boycott</HD>
<DH>Asia: Leading U.S. retailer agrees to quit selling apparel
made there, aiding human rights campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federated Department Stores has become the latest retailer to cut its
ties to Myanmar, handing human rights activists a victory in their
fight to unseat the country's military regime.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with tales of forced labor and ethnic cleansing, activists
have persuaded some of America's leading retailers to quit buying
apparel from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Federated, owner of
Bloomingdale's and Macy's; Ross Stores Inc.; and Gart Sports Co., the
nation's second-largest sporting goods chain, joined 29 other
retailers that have agreed not to sell products bearing the "Made in
Myanmar" label, according to the Free Burma Coalition, the
Washington-based nonprofit that organized the boycott campaign.</LD>
<LD>   A Federated spokeswoman said last month's decision to quit selling
goods produced in Myanmar was made because "what is going on there is
a violation of the philosophy and spirit of our vendor supplier code
of conduct."</LD>
<TE>   Myanmar has become an international pariah since its military
rulers seized the country in a bloody coup and refused to yield
control to the opposition, National League for Democracy, after it
won by a landslide in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo-based Unocal Corp. is one of the few U.S. firms still
operating in what is now one of the world's poorest countries. In a
landmark case, a Los Angeles federal judge recently ruled that Unocal
could be tried for human rights violations, including forced labor,
that allegedly occurred during construction of its $1.2-billion
natural gas pipeline in the Southeast Asian country.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and other countries have imposed wide-ranging sanctions
on Myanmar, including the cutoff of international aid, investment and
diplomatic ties. Last month, the State Department called on the
government of Myanmar to investigate a report accusing its military
of using rape as a weapon to terrorize ethnic minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Myanmar's ruling State Peace and Development Council has strongly
denied such accusations. Earlier this year, the cash-strapped
military leaders hired DCI Associates, a Washington political
consulting group, to lobby on the council's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   As its economy deteriorated, Myanmar's leaders invested heavily in
apparel production and exports to the U.S. jumped from $85 million in
1997 to $411 million in 2001. But the retail boycott and the slowing
economy have taken a toll, with apparel exports to the U.S. falling
35% this year, according to U.S. government figures.</TE>
<TE>   Southeast Asia experts said the tightening economic noose and a
threat by Congress to impose an import ban were factors in the
military junta's recent decision to ease up on its political
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the government released opposition leader and Nobel
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and freed more than 300
political prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Malinowski, who worked on Myanmar issues for the Clinton
administration and is now employed by Human Rights Watch Asia, a
human rights advocacy group, said "there's no question in my mind
that [economic pressure] played a role" in Myanmar's recent political
opening.</TE>
<TE>   But Malinowski and others urged the U.S. to maintain its
investment ban and other tough sanctions until Myanmar's government
releases the estimated 1,000-plus political prisoners still behind
bars and fulfills its promise to hold free and open elections.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Matthew P. Daley, deputy assistant secretary of State,
assured Congress that the Bush administration had "no plans at the
present time to remove our existing sanctions on Burma" because the
Myanmar government had taken only the "first step" toward democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation to ban imports from Myanmar is still "very much alive"
in Congress, according to a spokesman for Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo), the sponsor of the Burma Freedom Act. David Steinberg,
director of Asian studies at Georgetown University, said that measure
has a good chance of passage if Myanmar's leaders don't take concrete
steps toward political reform.</TE>
<TE>   "If those expectations are not met there will be repercussions
worse than before," Steinberg said. "I think it's encouraging that so

<CX>   Myanmar--An article in Thursday's Business section on U.S. retailers
cutting ties to Myanmar contained a quote that was incorrectly
attributed to David Steinberg, director of Asian studies at
Georgetown University. It was Jeremy Woodrum, director of the Free
Burma Coalition's Washington office, who said, "I think it's
encouraging that so many companies are willing to take action against
forced labor."</CX>

<HD>Cadiz Reports a Loss of Nearly $6 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadiz Inc., which is negotiating with the Metropolitan Water District
to build a controversial $150-million water storage program in the
Mojave Desert, said Wednesday that its losses widened in the last
quarter as its interest costs rose sharply.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based company said it lost nearly $6 million, or
16 cents a share, on revenue of $23 million in the second quarter,
compared with a loss of $5 million, or 14 cents, on $20.3 million in
revenue in the same period a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The overall financial strength of the company, which is led by
Keith Brackpool, a political supporter of and advisor to Gov. Gray
Davis, also deteriorated.</LD>
<TE>   Shareholder equity, or the value of Cadiz's assets after its debt
and other liabilities are subtracted, fell to $8.9 million from $17.7
million at the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, that figure was as high as $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Before the financial results were released, Cadiz shares fell 5
cents to close at $4.85 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Among the factors in the quarterly loss was an increase in
financing costs by more than $1 million, reflecting the higher price
Cadiz paid to increase a crucial bank line of credit and extend it
through January.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz earns most of its current revenue from farming in the
Central Valley, but its prospects depend largely on the fate of the
Mojave water project.</TE>
<TE>   The 50-year project would allow the MWD to store as much as 1.5
million acre-feet of surplus Colorado River water in the sands under
Cadiz property northeast of Palm Springs, extracting it for use
during dry years.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz also would have the right to sell the water district another
1.5 million acre-feet of water from an existing aquifer underlying
the parcel.</TE>
<TE>   The latter element of the plan has provoked stiff opposition from
critics, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who fear that
extracting so much water from the aquifer could damage the desert
ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   An environmental permit expected from the Interior Department has
been held up for months.</TE>
<TE>   Others have questioned whether the program makes economic sense.</TE>
<TE>   The MWD reminded Cadiz and Interior officials by letter last week
that it is by no means committed to the project.</TE>
<TE>   The district's board "has not approved its final contractual
arrangements with Cadiz Inc.," the letter said, adding that the MWD
was concerned that threatened cutbacks in Colorado River water
supplies to California might eliminate the surplus needed to fill the
storage zone and thus render the project pointless.</TE>
<TE>   The MWD "will be considering whether sufficient water supplies are
available on the Colorado River," the letter said.</TE>

<HD>ICN Pays $12 Million in Severance to Milan Panic</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it paid $12 million in severance to
company founder Milan Panic, who resigned as chairman and chief
executive in June after years of battling shareholders and
regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Panic remains a director of the company, which makes the hepatitis
drug ribavirin. Costa Mesa-based ICN disclosed the payment in a
regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   ICN named Robert O'Leary chief executive and chairman after Panic
lost a proxy fight with dissident shareholders over three seats on
the company's board.</LD>
<TE>   Last December, ICN agreed to plead guilty to a criminal securities
fraud charge and pay a $5.6-million penalty for waiting four months
in 1994 to tell investors that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
determined that doctors wouldn't be able to use ribavirin, alone, to
treat liver disease.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Edison International, parent of Southern California Edison, said it
had been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that its taxes
contained "deficiencies" for tax years 1994 to 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The Rosemead-based company said in a regulatory filing that it
plans to challenge the IRS findings. Edison said it has "meritorious
legal defenses" to the issues, most of which it dismissed as "timing
deficiencies."</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Southern California Edison said it prepaid $300
million of a $1.6-billion credit line to help the unit secure
investment-grade debt ratings.</LD>
<TE>   The other half of a $600-million portion of the loan is scheduled
to mature March 3. The credit line was secured in March after the
utility reached an agreement with the Public Utilities Commission to
use revenue from customers' power bills to pay $3.6 billion in
power-buying debt.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Edison International fell 20 cents to $12.35 on the New

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved the $43-million
purchase of a 10-acre parcel downtown for use as a surface parking
lot.</LD>
<LD>   The property at the northeast corner of Alameda and 1st streets,
the site of the former Los Angeles Soap Co. plant, had been entitled
for commercial and residential uses. Atlanta-based Trammell Crow
Residential negotiated to buy the land to build up to 600 units of
housing, but discussions were terminated after the city made its
offer to buy the site. The land has been vacant for more than a
decade since it was purchased by an affiliate of Taiwanese shipping
company Evergreen Marine Corp.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say the lot is needed to replace about 1,000
parking spaces that will be lost when the nearby Art Park property is
developed for cultural uses.</LD>

<HD>State May See More Energy Refunds</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Recalculating natural gas prices as part of a
FERC proceeding could lead to more money for California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California officials who think the state paid nearly $9 billion too
much for electricity during the energy crisis were feeling vindicated
Wednesday--perhaps by $1 billion or more--because federal regulators
said there was evidence that natural gas prices may have been
manipulated to keep up power prices.</LD>
<LD>   The federal finding was in a preliminary report Tuesday by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that offered a glimpse into how
the agency is building its case against energy traders. The interim
report ordered further investigations into Enron Corp. and two
smaller traders, but did not mention many of the big energy
generators Gov. Gray Davis and others have blamed for much of the
state's costly energy meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation is the most extensive by FERC. A final report,
which is not expected for months, will include other areas such as
the physical withholding of electricity and the use of Enron's
online-trading business to manipulate prices.</LD>
<TE>   Among the examples cited in the report was a single day in January
2001 when EnronOnline was able to boost the price of natural gas in
Southern California by more than $3 to $15 per decatherm, a common
measurement of natural gas trades, by using phony "wash" trading with
a single partner. In wash trading, two companies exchange similar
amounts of electricity or natural gas in an effort to boost volumes
or prices.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a police investigation. You continue to follow new
leads wherever they take you," FERC spokesman Kevin Cadden said.</TE>
<TE>   Findings of manipulation of natural gas price indexes could have
far-reaching implications for the state's attempts to win refunds of
alleged electricity overcharges during the crisis of 2000 and 2001. A
FERC hearing about whether California is due refunds is scheduled to
begin Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The report recommended recalculating the natural gas prices that
are a major component of electricity costs in the state. High natural
gas prices pushed up the price of electricity because natural gas
fuels many of power plants.</TE>
<TE>   There is evidence, FERC staffers said, that Enron and others
manipulated California natural gas price indexes that are published
by trade press such as Platts and Bloomberg. Platts, Bloomberg and
other publishers said Wednesday that their sampling methods are valid
and are designed to resist manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Recalculating the underlying natural gas prices being considered
as part of the refund proceeding FERC is conducting could mean more
money for California, state officials said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   That represents a rare bit of good news for California, which has
been on the losing end of several FERC rulings that have steadily
reduced the refund total to between $1 billion and $2 billion from
the original claim of $8.9 billion, said Eric Saltmarsh, acting
director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board. Refiguring the
natural gas price could add $1 billion to refund claims, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't scoff at $1 billion, but I don't want to nominate FERC
for the Nobel Prize either," Saltmarsh said. "We think there is $5
billion or $6 billion or $7 billion that consumers should be getting
that they're not getting." Davis was more scathing, calling the
report a "whitewash" that caters to the energy industry at the
expense of California electricity customers. Others are skeptical
that California will ever get back much money.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't hold out a lot of hope that FERC is going to order big
refunds, and if they do, I don't hold out a lot of hope that we will
ever be able to collect it" from cash-starved energy trading
companies, said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the UC Berkeley
Haas School of Business and director of the UC Energy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   FERC ordered new investigations Tuesday based on evidence of
possible price manipulation by three Enron subsidiaries, including
Portland General Electric Co., as well as Avista Energy Co. of
Spokane, Wash.; and El Paso Electric Co., a Texas utility that is not
affiliated with Houston-based natural gas pipeline operator El Paso
Corp. The stock of Avista's parent, Avista Corp., fell $1.65, or more
than 12%, to $11.80 on the New York Stock Exchange, and El Paso
Electric slipped 89 cents, or nearly 7%, to $11.91 on the American
Stock Exchange. The companies said they are cooperating with the FERC
investigation.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar to Restate Its 2001 Results</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. on Wednesday delayed the release
of its second-quarter results, announced it would restate financial
statements for last year and signaled a management shakeup ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The move, coming on the deadline for top executives to personally
certify their company's financial statements, offered yet another
sign of trouble at Pasadena-based Gemstar, which publishes TV Guide
magazine and produces electronic TV program guides.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it intended to restate 2001 earnings by reducing
revenue from its TV Guide subsidiary by about $20 million. Gemstar
said its audit committee also is reviewing revenue accounting
practices for "certain other transactions" and the allocation of
revenue among its interactive-platform division and
media-and-services division.</LD>
<TE>   In a step Gemstar described as unrelated to the financial
restatement, Chief Executive Henry Yuen and News Corp. have submitted
a joint proposal to Gemstar's board to restructure the company's
management. The proposal includes a settlement of disputes between
the parties, Gemstar said.</TE>
<TE>   The restructuring probably will show that News Corp., which last
year doubled its stake in Gemstar to 44%, is taking an even more
active role in managing the company and trying to halt the decline of
its investment. News Corp. was forced to take a $2-billion write-off
in March on its investment in Gemstar because of a drop in value.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar said it was delaying its second-quarter results after
concluding that collecting money from Scientific-Atlanta Inc. in a
patent dispute is no longer assured, and added that it would record a
full reserve. In June, an administrative law judge ruled that Gemstar
had misused one of its patents and could not recover damages from
Scientific-Atlanta, which Gemstar accused of infringing its patents.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar's stock has slipped steadily among questions of aggressive
accounting, court challenges to its dozens of patents covering
electronic program guides and slipping confidence in Yuen and his
management team.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar shares fell 33 cents to $3.34 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>News Corp. Losses Widen</HD>
<DH>Media: Write-down of Gemstar hurts results, but operating
profit jumps on ad recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media giant News Corp. on Wednesday posted a wider loss of $1.74
billion in its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 stemming from a
write-down of its investment in troubled Gemstar-TV Guide
International.</LD>
<LD>   But News Corp.'s quarterly operating profit surged 25% to $452
million, helped by recovering TV ad sales.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said it enjoyed a strong performance by its 20th
Century Fox film unit, which still is reaping profit from the
animated film "Ice Age" and also was helped by video sales of "Behind
Enemy Lines."</LD>
<TE>   News Corp.'s Gemstar write-down is a noncash adjustment that is
not expected to affect operations. But it does reflect a further
deterioration in what has proved an ill-fated investment in the
Pasadena-based developer of on-screen program guides.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a paper thing," News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch said in a
conference call with reporters. "It's an unfortunate thing.... We
still have great faith in the company. The underlying values are
there."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first hit that News Corp. has suffered at the hands
of Gemstar. In its previous quarter, the company posted a $4-billion
net loss as a result of the investment.</TE>
<TE>   For the full fiscal year, News Corp. lost $6.3 billion, nearly all
of it attributable to Gemstar, compared with a loss of $445 million a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue this year rose 10% to $15.2 billion, compared with $13.8
billion a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, News Corp.'s revenue climbed 11% to $3.8
billion, up from $3.4 billion a year ago. In last year's fourth
quarter, News Corp. had a net loss of $265 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar's stock has been especially hammered in the wake of an
unfavorable patent ruling. Gemstar shares closed Wednesday at $3.34 a
share, down 33 cents on Nasdaq, and are worth less than 10% of the
company's 52-week high of $39.30</TE>
<TE>   "News Corp. will have another $500 million to go [in losses] if
Gemstar's stock stays where it is," said Larry Haverty, an analyst at
State Street Research &amp; Management Co., an owner of News Corp.
American depositary receipts. "Overall, though, the pain has been
taken."</TE>
<TE>   But News Corp.'s write-off didn't faze Wall Street, which reacted
favorably to the operating results.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch media analyst Jessica Reif Cohen noted that the
company's operating results were healthy, adding that News Corp.'s
balance sheet is growing stronger with its cash balance boosted by
$700 million, to $3.6 billion, and debt slashed by $800 million, to
$8.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp.'s American depositary receipts closed Wednesday at
$21.48 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, up 73 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest boost in News Corp.'s fourth-quarter operating income
came at its film unit, which showed income of $75 million compared
with a year-earlier loss of $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Cable network programming posted quarterly operating income of $34
million, compared with a $1-million loss a year earlier. Television
operating income was off less than 3%, to $179 million in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Cablevision Systems Inc. may have to pay News Corp. an
estimated $1 billion to buy out its 40% interest in a sports
programming partnership, Murdoch said.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, Murdoch said he wants to
restructure the partnership. If the two sides can't reach an
agreement, he would exercise an option requiring Cablevision to buy
back News Corp.'s stake, possibly by December.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<BD>Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the insurance company famous for its
fire hat logo, has decided to end its long run of insuring the union
for New York City's bravest.</LD>
<LD>   The Uniformed Firefighters Assn. received a nonrenewal notice from
Fireman's on Wednesday, said Ken Hehir, the union's independent
insurance agent. The policy expires in November.</LD>
<LD>   Mia Benedict, spokeswoman for the Novato, Calif.-based company,
said the UFA was part of a group of unions with a joint insurance
policy that no longer met Fireman's Fund's underwriting standards.
She did not elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   "Our understanding is that they think Manhattan's too great of a
risk and they don't want to insure labor unions anymore," said Tom
Butler, spokesman for the 9,000-member union.</TE>
<TE>   Benedict said the company could no longer insure some Manhattan
clients because of the unpredictable risk of terrorist attacks, but
she called Butler's characterization incorrect.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not find Manhattan to be too great of a risk," she said.
"We do want to insure both Manhattan and unions."</TE>
<TE>   Hehir said the company tried to pull out of the UFA last November,
but that he had told Fireman's Fund officials it was too soon after
the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, in which 343
firefighters were killed.</TE>

<LD>A company contracted to produce certain Craftsman tools allegedly
defrauded Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. out of millions of dollars by making
counterfeits, Sears has claimed in a lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The civil lawsuit, filed in federal court, alleges that Emerson
Electric Co. concocted an elaborate scheme to use Sears'
manufacturing machines to make bench power tools for one of Sears'
competitors. Emerson denied Sears' allegations.</LD>
<LD>   On the NYSE, Sears shares gained $2.57, or 6.1%, to close at
$44.62, while Emerson climbed $1.33, or 2.9%, to $47.73.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inventories of unsold goods at U.S. companies rose in June for a
second straight month, reflecting more stockpiles of cars and
clothing, a government report showed.</LD>
<LD>   The 0.2% increase during the month matched May's rise, the
Commerce Department said. Sales at manufacturers, wholesalers and
retailers increased 0.3% after falling 0.3% in May.</LD>
<LD>   Signs of a tepid economic recovery are prompting companies to
control costs, including keeping a tight rein on inventories.</LD>
<TE>   The last time inventories rose in two or more months was February
1999 to January 2001, said Commerce officials.</TE>
<TE>   The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long goods remain
unsold, held at 1.36 months, close to a record-low 1.35 months' worth
in April.</TE>

<LD>Morgan Stanley faces a discrimination lawsuit by a 59-year-old female
vice president who says the securities firm fosters sex and age bias.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Fiebiger, who is seeking $25 million in damages, said in
the suit that she was passed over for promotions that went to
younger, male colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   She also claims that men at Morgan Stanley used insulting language
to refer to women.</LD>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Judy Hitchen said the firm hadn't been
served with Fiebiger's complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "We would state that the underlying claims of discrimination and
hostile work environment in this case were thoroughly investigated by
the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and dismissed earlier
this year," Hitchen said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said regulators may require a new trial for its
experimental treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
a drug Wall Street has been counting on to win approval and become a
big seller.</LD>
<LD>   A Lilly spokesman said the Food and Drug Administration has deemed
the drug, called Strattera, "approvable." But he said final approval
was contingent on the firm providing the FDA additional clinical
trial data or analyses that might require a new trial.</LD>
<LD>   The Indianapolis firm, which has been plagued by manufacturing
problems that have held up FDA approvals for drugs to treat
osteoporosis and schizophrenia, sought U.S. approval for Strattera in
October.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, Lilly &amp; Co. received a grand jury subpoena last month
from the Justice Department for allegedly marketing its Evista
osteoporosis drug for unapproved uses, the company said in a
regulatory filing.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. said the Securities and Exchange Commission
is reviewing its fiscal third-quarter and 2001 filings as new Chief
Executive Edward Breen conducts a investigation of the conglomerate's
finances dating back to 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Breen is conducting the review to reassure investors and "has no
reason to believe there will be any material adjustments," the
company said in the SEC filing.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco said areas the SEC's review is exploring include "adequacies
of disclosures" for acquisition integration plans; liabilities
accrued under the purchase accounting method of acquisitions; and how
the company records purchases of smaller individual accounts for its
security monitoring business.</LD>
<TE>   Breen also certified Tyco's report for the third quarter ended
June 30, even though the company isn't required to file a
certification because it's based in Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, former Tyco chief financial officer Richard D. Power is
suing the company on claims that the company owes him more than $9
million in severance pay.</TE>
<TE>   A Tyco spokeswoman declined to comment on the suit.</TE>

<HD>United Warns of Bankruptcy, Blames Costs</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Carrier says it needs concessions from unions and
creditors to qualify for a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, said Wednesday
that it would file for bankruptcy reorganization this fall if its
unions, suppliers and creditors failed to make deeper concessions in
the next 30 days to stem the company's cash drain.</LD>
<LD>   United said it needs the cuts to secure a $1.8-billion federal
loan guarantee and ensure its long-term survival, and its statement
clearly was aimed at putting pressure on labor and the others to
quickly agree to terms. But it won't be easy: Employees own 55% of
United, and its pilots' and mechanics' unions have powerful board
seats that give labor veto power over major corporate decisions, such
as filing for bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   "Unless we lower our costs dramatically, filing for bankruptcy
protection will be the only way we can ensure the company's future
and the continued operation of our airline," said Jack Creighton,
chairman of United and its parent, UAL Corp. United flies more than
200,000 people on a busy day and is the biggest operator at Los
Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<TE>   The prospect of a United bankruptcy intensified a week of enormous
upheaval in the airline business, in which US Airways sought
protection under the bankruptcy laws and industry leader American
Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., unveiled plans to slash operations by
9% and eliminate 7,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation also soared that United was teetering toward
Bankruptcy Court because the prolonged slump in air travel and the
carrier's relatively high costs, including labor, keep causing
massive losses at the airline. UAL lost an industry record $2.1
billion last year and is expected to lose more than $1 billion this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Prices of UAL's stock and bonds have plunged on Wall Street this
week. The stock fell 29 cents a share, or 11%, to $2.45 in New York
Stock Exchange trading Wednesday and was selling for $2.10 in
after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   United would be the largest airline bankruptcy reorganization in a
decade. Pan American World Airways and Eastern Air Lines tried to
reorganize in the early 1990s but ultimately collapsed. Smaller
carriers, such as Continental Airlines, later went through bankruptcy
and emerged stronger.</TE>
<TE>   United's threatened filing also will further unsettle the
traveling public, which already is struggling with the weak economy
and post-Sept. 11 skittishness about flying and heightened airport
security, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But others said the structured reorganization of a Chapter 11
filing is preferable to the uncertainty now swirling about United.
Under Chapter 11, a company keeps operating but its debts are frozen
and the company is protected from creditors' claims while it works
out a restructuring plan under the guidance of a bankruptcy judge.</TE>
<TE>   If United files, it "might be able to come out leaner and meaner,"
said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Assn., a
passenger trade group.</TE>
<TE>   But there's also the likelihood that Chapter 11 "would involve
cutting back on schedules that are unprofitable or underutilized,"
said Martin Zohn, a bankruptcy specialist at law firm Proskauer Rose
in Los Angeles. "That's inconvenient, but that's part of their
rehabilitation."</TE>
<TE>   Dexter Koehl, a spokesman for the Travel Industry Assn., said,
"Intellectually, people know that even if an airline goes into
bankruptcy it will continue operating. But psychologically, the
impact could be much different. Bankruptcies don't feel very stable,
and that is not what this industry needs right now."</TE>
<TE>   It's also commonplace that, after a company enters Chapter 11, its
existing stock becomes worthless because lenders and other creditors
have first claim on the company's assets. United's employees thus
could see their ownership of the airline vanish.</TE>
<TE>   Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based United has more than $2 billion in
cash on hand. But it's losing more than $1 million a day, and it
faces nearly $900 million in debt payments due this year. Some Wall
Street analysts say United's cash level will fall perilously low in a
few months without the government's help.</TE>
<TE>   The company has applied for a $1.8-billion loan guarantee that's
part of the post-Sept. 11 bailout of the industry. But the agency
running the program, the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, has
indicated that United first must gain bigger concessions.</TE>
<TE>   "Revenue isn't coming back the way the industry expected,"
Creighton said. "Demand isn't returning, fares are low, and the
industry is grappling with how to respond."</TE>
<TE>   (Separately Wednesday, the ATSB denied a request by National
Airlines Inc. for a $50.5-million loan guarantee, saying the
privately held Las Vegas-based carrier failed to provide a reasonable
assurance of repayment.)</TE>
<TE>   United's statement raises the already contentious relations
between it and its unionized employees. United for months has sought
wage cuts and other concessions from the unions representing pilots,
mechanics and flight attendants. But only the pilots have agreed to
givebacks, and the other two didn't sound more receptive to
concessions Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Machinists, which represents 35,000
mechanics and other United ground workers, said it's "ready to
continue discussions" but made no specific comment about cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Zack, a spokesman for the Assn. of Flight Attendants, said
United has refused to address some of the union's concerns about its
members' pay levels, which the union deems necessary before
negotiating any future concessions.</TE>
<TE>   But even United's pilots are frustrated that the other groups
aren't cooperating more, said Steve Derebey, a spokesman for the Air
Line Pilots Assn. "We just wish that the other employee groups would
get on board as we have and face reality," he said.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Posts $12-Billion Loss</HD>
<DH>The French media giant will sell publishing house Houghton
Mifflin to reduce debt</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French media conglomerate Vivendi Universal on Wednesday revealed a
$12-billion loss for the first half of the year and said it would
sell its prized U.S. publishing house Houghton Mifflin and other
assets to help stem a deepening cash crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi's new chief executive, Jean-Rene Fourtou, acknowledged
that the company "is facing a liquidity problem," but said he had
reached a tentative agreement for a $2.9-billion loan from French
banks by the end of this month. He also vowed to raise $9.8 billion
from asset sales in the next two years to lower Vivendi's sizable
debt.</LD>
<LD>   But his assurances did little to calm investors. Vivendi's stock
fell 26% on the Paris market to their lowest level since June 1994.
And credit-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's lowered Vivendi's debt to
"junk" status. Moody's Investors Service also downgraded Vivendi and
said that if the company fails to get a bank loan in the next few
weeks, "that would lead to a severe short-term liquidity problem."</LD>
<TE>   The credit downgrades will substantially raise borrowing costs for
Vivendi and may complicate the company's efforts to avoid a fire sale
of other assets, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's statements startled financial analysts and Houghton
Mifflin employees who had been told by Fourtou in an e-mail just two
weeks ago that Houghton was not for sale. "The flip-flop on Houghton
indicates that their cash position is more desperate than we
thought," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein. "It's not a pretty picture."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi bought the Boston-based publisher last year for $2.2
billion, one of a slew of acquisitions by Fourtou's predecessor,
Jean-Marie Messier. In the last two years, Messier turned a water
utility into the world's second-largest media company by buying
Universal Studios, French pay-television firm Canal Plus and the
entertainment assets of Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc. But the
purchases left Vivendi with $34 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou, a veteran pharmaceutical executive, replaced Messier last
month after he was ousted in a boardroom coup.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Universal Studios say they have been largely kept in
the dark about how Fourtou's restructuring plans will affect them.
But studio executives say Vivendi eventually will sell or, more
likely, spin off its entertainment assets.</TE>
<TE>   However, that won't happen any time soon because of the sagging
stock market and because there are no obvious suitors for Vivendi's
U.S. entertainment assets, say Universal sources and analysts. Those
assets include the Universal movie studio, theme parks and the USA
and Sci-Fi cable TV channels.</TE>
<TE>   "For Houghton Mifflin, there are a lot of buyers. We're harder to
sell and expensive," a studio source said. Analysts estimate that
Universal Studios alone could be worth about $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly likely scenario has been that Vivendi would spin off
its U.S. entertainment assets to the public as a separate entity to
be run by media mogul Diller and controlled by Vivendi's current
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Diller, who runs Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the umbrella
unit for the movie, television and theme park group, seems
well-positioned to assume management control of the entertainment
assets. In December, Vivendi paid Diller $10.3 billion for the TV and
film properties of USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   The easiest assets to unload might be Universal's theme parks in
Hollywood, Orlando, Fla., and Osaka, Japan, which could fetch $400
million to $1 billion, analysts said. But analysts say weak forecasts
for theme park attendance is likely to damp interest among possible
suitors, such as Walt Disney Co. and Viacom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been speculation that Vivendi Universal may try to
reduce its debts by selling off Universal Music Group, home to such
stars as Eminem and Mariah Carey. But sources at Universal, the
world's leading record company, say there is no such plan in the
immediate future.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Vivendi put Universal Music on the auction block, those
sources say, there is no likely buyer because Wall Street has soured
on the music business because of rampant music piracy and soaring
costs in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, music executives and analysts predict that Fourtou will
wait at least a year before considering a sale, hoping that market
will improve for the industry overall.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless it's a fire-sale price, there's no incentive for anyone to
risk their already stretched balance sheet to buy any of these
assets," said Paul Kim, a media analyst with Kaufman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin, the fourth-biggest U.S. publishing house, is
among several businesses that Fourtou plans to sell to raise cash.
"We have numerous potential buyers," he said. Buyers could include
Random House, which is owned by German media group Bertelsmann, and
French publishing company Lagardere, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, this comes as a surprise," said Houghton Mifflin
spokesman Collin Earnst. "We believed it wasn't the intent of Vivendi
to sell us."</TE>
<TE>   A Vivendi spokeswoman said Fourtou changed course because of
changing circumstances in the last two weeks, declining to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   To help meet his $9.8-billion target, Vivendi also plans this year
to sell off nonprofitable portions of Canal Plus and to float a
minority stake in the remaining French pay-TV company. Vivendi also
is considering selling its 44% stake in French telecom company
Cegetel, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Vivendi said its first-half loss was mostly due to a
$10.8-billion write-down to reflect a steep depreciation in the value
of its media assets. Excluding the write-down and other charges,
Vivendi's loss was $65 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's results were hurt by rising interest costs and the poor
performance of Canal Plus and Vivendi's Internet division.</TE>
<TE>   But Vivendi Universal Entertainment had a strong first half, with
its operating income increasing 36% to $519 million. Strong
box-office results from movies such as "Scorpion King" and "A
Beautiful Mind" helped offset a 7% decline in revenue from
Universal's theme parks in Hollywood and Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Music's operating income fell 28% to $166 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares fell $3.67, or 24%, to $11.66 on the New York Stock
Exchange, a 52-week low. They have fallen 78% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Since he took over, Fourtou has been replacing executives close to
Messier. On Wednesday, he announced that Jean-Bernard Levy would
replace Eric Licoys as Vivendi's chief operating officer.</TE>

<LD>Westwood cemetery--A story in Friday's California section about
Westwood Village Memorial Park stated incorrectly that a building
permit application for a property designated as a historic-cultural
monument would trigger a review by the Cultural Heritage Commission
lasting at least six months. In fact, the commission or its staff
architect would have 15 days to approve or object to the permit. If
the commission objects, the application would be withheld for 30 to
180 days. At the end of the 180 days, the commission could petition
the City Council for another 180 days, during which time preservation
proponents would be required to report on progress, if any, toward
preservation of the property.</LD>

<LD>Crystal Kochendorfer, a former social worker and longtime child
educator, was appointed chairwoman Wednesday of the Orange County
Children and Families Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The county panel was created under Proposition 10, a state
initiative passed by voters in 1998 that added a 50-cent sales tax on
tobacco products to fund educational programs, child care and health
resources for children up to age 5.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a wonderful opportunity to make a difference for our
county's youngest citizens, who are usually the most needy,"
Kochendorfer said.</LD>
<TE>   In 1988, she was elected to the Capistrano Unified School District
Board of Trustees, on which she served as president three times.</TE>
<TE>   Among Kochendorfer's planned projects is to partner the commission
with 13 county school districts to identify child health and learning
barriers. The commission will also look at the importance of dental
care to overall heath, as well as the increasing numbers of young
children and their families living in motels throughout Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   Kochendorfer said her interest in child advocacy and education
issues stems from her experience as a social worker for Los Angeles
and Long Beach in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   "She's got the front-line experience and knows what it takes to
promote educational success," said Children and Families Commission
Executive Director Michael Ruane.</TE>

<HD>Star Power Lights Up a Pasadena Civic Plan</HD>
<DH>Funding: The city's utility customers are getting a rebate.
School officials and Arnold Schwarzenegger have an idea of how to
spend it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasadena Water and Power customers got an interesting bit of mail
last month: a personal plea from Arnold Schwarzenegger. But it wasn't
a pitch for his latest Hollywood blockbuster.</LD>
<LD>   It was about their utility bill.</LD>
<LD>   Some 60,000 Pasadena utility customers are slated to receive power
rebates totaling $14.9 million this summer. And that money,
Schwarzenegger's plea suggested, could support after-school programs.</LD>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger is pictured on the front of the postcard, biceps
bulging, one hand supporting a barbell on which five kids perch, the
other pointing outward in a kind of Uncle Sam-wants-you pose. "Show
the strength of your heart," a message from the former Mr. Olympia
reads.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign, brainchild of Pasadena Unified School Board Member
Ed Honowitz, is part of an innovative partnership between the school
district and the city to replace two nonrenewable federal grants.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was, even if a very small percentage ended up making a
donation, you could wind up generating some significant funds,"
Honowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, in order to compete in a deregulated electric industry,
Pasadena Water and Power restructured utility rates and instituted a
five-year surcharge.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, city officials realized that the surcharge, which was
to expire in July 2002, had already created a debt reserve of almost
$150 million. They decided to end the surcharge a year early--and to
rebate its customers almost $15 million, the amount collected since
July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, the Pasadena Unified School District was
trying to figure out how to replace two expiring federal grants. The
first, for $1.2 million, funded eight elementary and middle schools,
expired June 30. The second, for $987,000, supports another six
schools and will expire next June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The program, Pasadena LEARNs, serves 2,000 children a day in 19
schools, providing students with some academic enrichment after
school.</TE>
<TE>   Honowitz, who won election to the school board last year, said the
idea to marry the two programs came after he heard a talk by Phyllis
Currie, general manager of Pasadena Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   "She was discussing the overall rebate of that ... surcharge, and
that led me to think about what the district's rebate would be,"
Honowitz said. "Then, in some discussions around that with my wife,
we had this ... idea of allowing people to donate their rebates to
support the program."</TE>
<TE>   The city quickly approved the plan in May, and the school board
set aside $41,000 for publicity.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaard, who knows Schwarzenegger through a
mutual friend, enlisted the actor's help in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger, a proponent of a November ballot initiative,
Proposition 49, to increase state funding for after-school and
early-morning programs, offered his support for the donation effort
and his image for the postcards.</TE>
<TE>   Bogaard in turn said he has agreed to endorse Proposition 49. The
Pasadena City Council adopted a resolution in support of the measure
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena LEARNs director Margaret Shoemaker said the
Schwarzenegger mailer was the "tipping point" in the campaign to
raise awareness of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals and businesses that donate their rebates will receive
a tax deduction courtesy of the Pasadena Educational Foundation, the
school district's nonprofit wing. Residential customers will receive
an average rebate of $75. Business customers account for about $11
million of the total utility rebates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very creative program," said Stephen Norton, a spokesman
for Pasadena-based office products firm Avery Dennison, which plans
to donate 25%--about $12,000--of its rebate.</TE>
<TE>   Other businesses also say they plan to donate rebate money, too,
but LEARNs has only about $11,000 in hand so far.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the cyclical nature of PWP billing, city officials said
they will not be able to measure the true yield of the donations
program until mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Dee Romney, who ran against Honowitz in the 2001 school board
election, said LEARNs has failed to develop a track record for
enhancing academics. She questioned whether seeking donations is the
best way to help a program that already has uncertain funding.</TE>
<TE>   "They are expanding the program without any financing for the
original schools," she said. "It's a very costly program."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Fowler, a former school board member who is a special
assistant to the city manager, is one of several Pasadena officials
who said she sees the rebate donation program as an example of the
innovation that can occur when city officials think creatively.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of how successful it is financially," she said, "it
has raised the profile of the program. It has increased the
credibility of the district and the board in the eyes of the city.
One thing the city of Pasadena has done is to make sure that the
public is aware of these programs. And what better form of publicity
than a campaign like this?"</TE>

<HD>Belmont Shore Rapist May Be Linked to Attack in Huntington</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man grabs woman, 75, in her home, but she fights him
off. Circumstances fit pattern of series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are trying to determine whether the man who attacked a
75-year-old woman in Huntington Beach on Tuesday night is the
so-called Belmont Shore rapist suspected in at least 11 assaults in
Long Beach, west Orange County and Seattle since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The attacker entered a house in the 15000 block of Cambay Lane
about 11:30 p.m. and grabbed the woman from behind. The victim, who
had called 911 when she first heard the intruder inside her house,
managed to fight off the man and forced him to flee, police said.
Officers arrived within minutes of the call and used dogs to search
the area.</LD>
<LD>   The incident fit the pattern of the Belmont Shore rapist, who
attacks older women late at night. Police stopped short of saying it
was the same perpetrator, however, cautioning that their
investigation is still in its early stages.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know if he was there to commit a sexual assault or not,"
Huntington Beach Police spokesman Sgt. Gary Meza said. "There's a
little similarity. But other than that he's ... attacked an elderly
woman, we don't know for sure. It's premature at this point to say
that it is him."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach police said they are sharing information with
Huntington Beach police and assisting with the investigation. "We're
not positively sure there's a connection," said Long Beach Police
spokesman Officer David Marander. "But from the onset, it appears
they could possibly be related."</TE>
<TE>   Police have recovered evidence linking the serial rapist to 11
sexual assaults and believe he may have committed four others in Long
Beach or Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The rapist has attacked at least eight Long Beach women, always
entering through an open door or window late at night or early in the
morning. The women range in age from 32 to 77 and most were alone.</TE>
<TE>   In all cases, the victims' faces were covered, preventing them
from getting a description of the attacker. The suspect also covered
his face in many cases, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The string of sexual assaults began in August 1996 with the rape
of a 40-year-old woman in Seattle. The first Long Beach attack
occurred in January 1997, also on a 40-year-old woman. The last
verified assault occurred at 2:30 a.m. June 26 in the Belmont
Heightsarea of Long Beach, where a 61-year-old woman was attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe the rapist also sexually assaulted a 72-year-old
woman in Los Alamitos on May 11 and assaulted a 68-year-old woman in
the same neighborhood an hour later. The only other confirmed Orange
County attack came in June 2000 in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We're aggressively investigating this case," Marander said. "It's
at the forefront of our investigations."</TE>
<TE>   With fear mounting over the unsolved attacks, police are seeking
the public's help.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking that they secure their homes and notify us of any
suspicious activity," Marander said. "Evidently this person has been
able to blend in for some time. So this might be someone you wouldn't
necessarily think would commit these crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Because victims have given a variety of descriptions of the
rapist, police have been unable to release a detailed sketch.
Detectives aren't even certain of his race.</TE>
<TE>   Marander said the evidence linking the 11 incidents includes
clothing fiber and bodily fluids.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not disclose how the attacker in the Huntington Beach
case entered the victim's home.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night's attack surprised those who live near the victim in
north Huntington Beach. The neighborhood has a mix of young and old
families, and is next to an industrial warehouse complex.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely shocked that this happened in our neighborhood,
and scared," said Cindy Ane, who lives near where the attack
occurred. "I felt really safe here."</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach police ask that anyone with information call
(714) 375-5066. Long Beach police have set up a sexual assault
hotline at (800) 600-1110.</TE>

<HD>Teen Tells of Altercation at Home</HD>
<DH>Trial: Co-defendant Jennifer Childs of Simi Valley says she
hit her stepfather with a bat to protect her mother.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aspiring pop singer Jennifer Childs told a Ventura County jury
Wednesday that she hit her stepfather over the head with a baseball
bat to force him to release his hold of her ailing mother.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Childs, 19, is accused of conspiring with her mother,
Eileen, 37, to kill the woman's husband, Larry Childs, by setting
fire to his bed and then beating him with bats during an altercation
in the family's Simi Valley home.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys say the two acted in self-defense.</LD>
<TE>   On the witness stand Wednesday, Jennifer Childs was composed as
she described her version of what occurred before dawn March 25.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid he might be hurting my mother," she told jurors. "I
thought I wouldn't be able, without some object, to make him stop."</TE>
<TE>   The women are charged with attempted murder, arson and use of
deadly weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs also faces two child-endangerment charges because
her two young sons were in the house at the time of the fire, and a
charge of felony grand theft alleging she forged her husband's name
on a $132,000 insurance check.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that Eileen and Jennifer Childs had wanted to
cash in on a $1.4-million life insurance policy held by Larry Childs,
57, in part to buy out a recording contract so Eileen Childs could
become Jennifer Childs' manager.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager, who performs under the name Jenni Childs, said
Wednesday she was "very excited" about her current contract and had
never considered her mother taking over her singing career.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Jennifer Childs said, the two discussed how happy they
were with the way things were going in her career the night before
the altercation.</TE>
<TE>   According to the earlier testimony of Larry Childs, he awoke in
the middle of the night to find his bed in flames and went to check
on the family. When he entered the living room, he testified,
Jennifer and Eileen Childs came at him swinging baseball bats at his
head.</TE>
<TE>   His stepdaughter's account was different.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Childs said she had fallen asleep on the couch the night
before and awoke in the middle of the night to the smell of smoke.
She then went to find her mother, she testified, who was sleeping in
the room of her 11-year-old half-brother, Jacob.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Childs said she and her mother started down the hallway
of the house to investigate the smoke smell, when Larry Childs flung
open the door to the couple's master bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like a crazy person--like a wild animal," she
testified.</TE>
<TE>   "He came running down the hall toward my mother and I and grabbed
us both by the hair, then pulled, pushed and dragged us down the
hall."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Childs said that was when she grabbed a wooden bat, which
her younger siblings had used the previous day during Little League
practice. She saw her parents in a struggle, she said, and then hit
Larry Childs about five times until he let go of her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to hurt him," she said. "I just wanted him to let
go of my mother."</TE>
<TE>   She said she did not set fire to her stepfather's mattress, and
testified that Larry Childs had made statements before March
25--during fits of anger--about setting the house on fire.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee grilled Jennifer
Childs on the details of her account and attempted to show
inconsistencies between the teenager's testimony and what she had
previously told Simi Valley police.</TE>
<TE>   Lee questioned, for instance, how Eileen Childs could have gotten
out of Jacob's bed as quickly as Jennifer Childs had indicated in her
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   In her previous testimony, the teen said her mother, who suffers
from lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease, had severe trouble
walking and bending down.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Childs also admitted on cross-examination that she never
knew whether there was a fire in the house, never saw what her
stepfather was allegedly doing to her mother and heard no sounds
other than her mother whining, "Ow."</TE>
<TE>   "So you found that the only thing to do was to hit your stepfather
over the head with a bat?" Lee asked.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Childs responded calmly, "Yes, I did."</TE>

<HD>Hotel's Trek to Hipness Trips on the Economy</HD>
<DH>Business: Dot-com meltdown batters S.F. inns, including the
newly chic Clift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Hip hotelier Ian Schrager called it his "most grown-up
project"--transforming the venerable Clift Hotel, longtime bastion of
old money and rep ties, into the coolest luxury hotel in town.</LD>
<LD>   Now, just keeping it open is turning out to be the greater feat,
as the signature hotel of the new, avant-garde San Francisco
struggles with the rest of the city through the dot-com bust and
unanticipated economic downturn.</LD>
<LD>   The born-again Clift opened last August to generally rave reviews.
"Reflective of tomorrow, but respective of yesterday," waxed San
Francisco's stylish Mayor Willie Brown. "It's going to be one of the
hot spots for San Francisco for a very long time."</LD>
<TE>   What Schrager's ultra-chic Mondrian Hotel became for Los Angeles,
the radically revamped Clift was supposed to be for San
Francisco--only more so.</TE>
<TE>   But a year later, the Clift is caught up in what the local hotel
business is calling its worst crisis since the end of World War II,
when the city emptied of sailors and soldiers. The 367-room Clift is
seldom more than half full; its expensive restaurant is hemorrhaging
money and, according to industry sources, the Clift has scrambled to
make timely payments on its principal loan.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the collapse of the critical dot-com sector, the general
post-Sept. 11 tourism doldrums and the recession, some say there was
a cultural miscalculation by Schrager, whose chain of super-hip
boutique hotels remains the rage in New York, Miami and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco is still a small city. What works in other cities
does not necessarily work here," said travel book author Erika
Lenkert, who headed a drive to save the Clift's famous Redwood Room
bar from a radical makeover by Schrager's designers.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is how many hip people can you cram into one hotel
at one time?" said hotel real estate specialist Bob Eaton.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Clift, it may not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurant Losses</TE>
<TE>   Hotel consultant Rick Swig, who represents GMAC Corp., the loan
service agent for the Clift's lenders, said Schrager has satisfied
the lenders for the time being. "They bought themselves a year," said
Swig, scion of a famous San Francisco hotel family whose grandfather
owned the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by telephone in New York, Schrager dismissed any notion
that the Clift was in danger of closing. "We are servicing our debt.
We have a lot of equity invested in the hotel. We are not in risk of
default. We are just waiting for the market to get better to make the
kind of money we had planned," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schrager confirmed reports that the restaurant is losing $3
million in its first year, but said he is in negotiations to try to
keep it open. "Hopefully, we will be able to work something out," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Clift, like other San Francisco hotels, got caught in what
Schrager described as a "perfect storm" of conditions that made its
problems more severe than those of hotels in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by Smith Travel Research, the main hotel industry
performance index, said hotel occupancy rates in San Francisco and
neighboring San Mateo had dropped 59% in the first six months of this
year, the steepest decline in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   To attract guests, most San Francisco hotels, including the Clift,
have drastically lowered rates. When it opened last year, the Clift
listed room rates at $325 to $530, with suites going for as high as
$2,025. But rooms are now available on the Internet for less than
$200.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have wished that the Clift opened up in a stronger
market," Schrager said. "But I believe in the fundamental soundness
of the San Francisco area."</TE>
<TE>   When Schrager bought the Clift in 1998, it created an instant
sensation in San Francisco, where the squat, 17-story, brick hotel on
Geary Street near Union Square had been a landmark of blueblood San
Francisco society since it opened in 1913.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he took over the Clift, Schrager had built a
reputation as one of America's trendiest hoteliers, starting with his
stylish renovation of New York City's old Hudson Hotel in 1984. Since
then, the Schrager chain has expanded to eight hotels in New York,
Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and London. Still under
construction is Schrager's remake of the landmark Miramar Hotel in
Montecito, the elite enclave just outside Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   When Schrager arrived in San Francisco, rival hoteliers held their
breath.</TE>
<TE>   "Our very first reaction was fear and curiosity," said Rob
Delamater, vice president of the Joie de Vivre hotel chain. "Schrager
was the superstar in our industry. The fear was that the Clift would
blow us out of the water."</TE>
<TE>   The key element of the Schrager formula is a sense of velvet-rope
exclusivity borrowed from his days as co-owner of the famous Studio
54 nightclub in the 1970s. You do not choose a Schrager hotel, said
Steve Pinetti, marketing director of the San Francisco-based Kimpton
hotel chain; it chooses you. Being accepted there is a confirmation
of your stylishness.</TE>
<TE>   The Clift Hotel, for example, carries no sign over its door or in
its lobby. The message is that if you do not know where you are, you
are not cool enough to be there.</TE>
<TE>   The lobby, decorated by French designer Philippe Starck with a
hugely oversized Louis XV chair as its centerpiece, is as imposing as
it is inviting.</TE>
<TE>   "The Schrager environment is not about fun," said Pinetti, who
regularly stays at the Mondrian when he is in Los Angeles. "There is
a lot of pressure when you walk into a Schrager hotel. You better be
looking right and feeling fit."</TE>
<TE>   In its previous incarnation, the Clift Hotel was famous for a
different kind of exclusivity founded on the very conservative
standards of old San Francisco, one of the last cities in America
where women wearing dress gloves and hats are not an uncommon sight.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco restaurateur Gianni Fassio recalls being ejected
from the Clift in the early 1970s because his hair was considered too
long. Actor Michael Douglas, then performing in a play at a nearby
theater, got the same treatment. Coat and tie were de rigueur in the
Clift's stately French Room restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   For a time under the same ownership as the elegant Santa Barbara
Biltmore, the Clift was the place where uniformed bellhops walked the
guests' dogs and where a guest could be confident that if he dropped
his reading glasses, an attendant's gloved hand would be there to
catch them.</TE>
<TE>   The social center of the hotel was the magnificent Redwood Room
bar, named for the rich, solid wood panels that lined its walls. The
Redwood was where San Francisco society gathered for martinis before
and after the theater. Anniversaries were celebrated there. Famed San
Francisco columnist Herb Caen was a regular.</TE>
<TE>   So when the Schrager takeover was announced, it provoked a panic
among San Francisco traditionalists, convinced that the Redwood Room
was endangered when Schrager's designers signaled a total remake.</TE>
<TE>   A committee, San Franciscans for Saving the Redwood Room, was
hastily created by travel writer Lenkert, and it quickly generated a
swell of nostalgic support.</TE>
<TE>   "They almost rode me out of town on a rail over the Redwood Room,"
Schrager said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he was able to appease most of his critics. The
essential Art Deco style of the room was maintained, although the old
75-foot redwood burl and Italian marble bar, flanked by two brass
elephant heads, was replaced with a cut-glass countertop. The Gustav
Klimt prints were supplanted by digital panels that project an array
of images, including the old Klimts.</TE>
<TE>   But the clientele had completely changed. Occasionally, formally
attired older couples would wander into the bar, looking lost in the
swirl of modish 20-year-olds. Customers in suits and ties risked
being turned away in favor of the more casually dressed.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the Clift can't afford to be picky. Many of the
high-rolling dot-com crowd that the hotel beckoned have either left
town or been traumatized by the events of the last year. The question
for Schrager is whether his hotel can be a port in the storm that is
buffeting his clientele.</TE>
<TE>   "A kind of post-Sept. 11, post-hip mentality has emerged," said
Delamater, creative director of the Joie de Vivre chain.</TE>
<TE>   "Schrager is at the pinnacle of the ethereal, uber-hip at a time
when people are wanting to be more grounded. The era of the post-hip
hotel is about to begin," Delamater said.</TE>
<TE>   Comeback Predicted</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Schrager insists that is all nonsense and that he
still has the right formula to flourish here.</TE>
<TE>   Although harder hit than other cities, San Francisco will make a
comeback sometime in the next five years, Schrager predicted. He
plans to be there when it does.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco is a city of contradictions," Schrager said. "It
still has that liberal element and also has a very conservative
element. It still has an incredible amount of young people and a big
gay population. It's a big bouillabaisse, full of contradictions. But
these same contradictions produce energy, and that is exactly why I
am attracted to them."</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Pedestrian Peril Cited</HD>
<DH>City Ranks as 3rd Most Dangerous Place in California, Even
Though It Has Low Percentage of Walkers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard ranks as the third most dangerous place to walk in California,
according to a study released this week of 58 cities with populations
over 100,000.</LD>
<LD>   There were two pedestrians killed in the city in 2001 and a total
of 101 injured, according to the report by the Washington, D.C.-based
Surface Transportation Policy Project.</LD>
<LD>   Those numbers dipped slightly from the previous year when four
walkers were killed and 103 were injured.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard police officials Wednesday acknowledged the problem and
said many of the accidents involve pedestrians or bicyclists walking
or riding into the path of traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we are going to make it safer for people to walk, but
people who are walking need to look out for themselves, especially if
they are with children," Police Sgt. Ron Whitney said. "There is no
way they can win against a car."</TE>
<TE>   In the report, which was compiled with statistics from the
California Highway Patrol, Oxnard was ranked behind Vallejo in Solano
County and Inglewood in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, Simi Valley placed 39th with two deaths and 19
injuries, followed by Ventura, which was 43rd, and Thousand Oaks,
which ranked 55th.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County ranked as the 12th most dangerous for pedestrians
out of a total of 35 counties with populations over 100,000. That
compares with ninth place in 2000 and 17th in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   There were 13 pedestrians killed in the county in 2001 versus 10
the previous year. The number of injuries dropped from 249 in 2000 to
240 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, there were 721 pedestrian fatalities in 2001, an
increase of 5% from the previous year, and 14,545 injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Kristi Kimball, spokeswoman for the study group, said the
organization's statistics were compiled using several variables.</TE>
<TE>   For example, although other cities recorded more deaths than the
two in Oxnard, Oxnard ranked as more dangerous based on the
percentage of people who walk there each day. According to the 2000
census, 1.6% of the city's 182,000 residents walk to work. That's
about 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the city of San Bernardino, which reported nine
pedestrian deaths and 70 injuries last year, ranked 46th. The city
has a population of 189,800, of which nearly 5,000 people, or 2.6%,
walk to work.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things hurting Oxnard and other cities in the top
eight or 10 is that they have low rates of people who are walking to
work, but still have a good number of injuries and fatalities,"
Kimball said.</TE>
<TE>   The study's rankings also showed a pattern between pedestrian
danger and rapidly growing cities such as Oxnard, which grew 20%
during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings also suggest a relationship between pedestrian danger
and ethnicity. The 10 most dangerous cities have nonwhite populations
of at least 64%. Oxnard's population is 62% Latino, according to the
census.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants are often accustomed to environments where walking is
safer, or may not have the financial means to afford a vehicle, the
study found.</TE>
<TE>   Other factors include how cities are designed. Pedestrian-heavy
cities such as San Francisco and Berkeley, with more crosswalks and
flashing signals, are safer, Kimball said.</TE>
<TE>   "The cities with the most walkers are often the safest," she said.</TE>

<HD>Autopsy Fails to Show Cause of Inmate's Death</HD>
<DH>County Jail: Officials say the man, 33, was found not
breathing in the medical ward. More tests are planned, but they could
take months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An autopsy has failed to determine why a 33-year-old inmate died
Saturday in his cell in the Ventura County Jail medical ward, and
blood and other samples have been forwarded to forensic experts for
examination, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The cause is undetermined, and we're awaiting drug testing and
microscopic examination," said Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran.
"There was no trauma, no evidence of injury. There's really no
evidence to indicate suicide at this point."</LD>
<LD>   Such tests usually take three to four months.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said the inmate, Steven Thompson of Oxnard, had a long
criminal history and had been in the County Jail since March,
awaiting trial for robbery and parole violations.</TE>
<TE>   His death is the third this year in the County Jail--one by
suicide and two by yet undetermined causes. The latter were getting
medical treatment in jail. A Times investigation last year found that
the jail has had an unusually high rate of inmate deaths since the
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   O'Halloran said he was not sure whether Thompson had a history of
illegal drug use. But a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, which
runs the jail, said the inmate had a drug abuse conviction within the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   And his wife, Marie Rosalie Thompson, 53, of Oxnard, said he had
drug problems in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "He did have medical problems, epileptic seizures, and he'd had a
few blackouts and was very dehydrated," she said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   She said she talked with her husband Saturday morning, not long
before his death. "He just told me he was tired, and he was going to
lie down," she said. "I guess about an hour after that they found
him. But he was a strong man, and he shouldn't have died like that."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson was discovered not breathing in a locked single-person
cell in the jail's medical ward at 11:10 a.m. Saturday, an hour after
a deputy on rounds heard him snoring, said Sheriff's Chief Deputy
Kenneth Kipp, who oversees the jail.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates in nearby cells said they heard nothing to indicate a
problem, Kipp said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson had been in the infirmary for treatment of a condition
not considered serious or life-threatening, Kipp said. He said he
could not be specific about the ailment without written permission
from Thompson's family.</TE>
<TE>   Kipp said Thompson had been convicted of drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But since Thompson had been in custody for nearly a year, drugs
were not the likely problem unless the inmate hoarded his medication
or somehow acquired narcotics illicitly, the chief deputy said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson had been in state prison for all but two months since
1998, when he was convicted of second-degree robbery and a parole
violation for failing to register as a sex offender. The second crime
resulted from a 1991 conviction for sexual battery and indecent
exposure, Kipp said.</TE>
<TE>   Released last summer, Thompson was rearrested Aug. 29 on suspicion
of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. He returned to prison in
Wasco, and had been in the County Jail since March, awaiting trial on
the new charges.</TE>
<TE>   A Times study found in December that the Ventura County Jail has
had an unusually high rate of inmate deaths since a Monterey firm,
California Forensic Medical Group, began providing health and
psychiatric care 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   State records show that the death rate for Ventura County Jail
inmates from 1987-2000 was fourth-highest among the state's 20
largest jail systems. Only Stanislaus, Los Angeles and San Francisco
counties had higher death rates per year per 1,000 inmates. For the
seven years before California Forensic gained the Ventura County
contract, typically one local inmate died each year. But that number
has doubled on average during the firm's tenure, and peaked at six in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 30 deaths from 1987 to 2001, one was a homicide, eight were
suicides and 21 were classified as deaths by natural causes. The
inmates' average age at death was younger than 40.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the county Board of Supervisors awarded California
Forensic a new five-year contract worth about $26 million.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials cited low cost and high quality as chief
reasons for rehiring the firm instead of accepting a rival proposal
from Prison Health Services of Nashville, the nation's largest
provider of health care in jails.</TE>
<TE>   Kipp said he has seen nothing to indicate that the quality of
health care had anything to do with the three deaths this year. As is
policy, the first two cases were referred to an independent physician
for review, and experts found no problem with care, Kipp said. The
Thompson case will be handled the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "My information is that the medical care they received was more
than adequate," Kipp said.</TE>

<HD>No Force in Abduction, Police Say</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The girl, 4, was probably led from park by
hand, officials believe. The alleged kidnapper's motives remain
unclear.</DH>

<LD>Jessica Cortez probably was not taken by force and was not harmed by
the mother of four who allegedly kept her for two days, interim LAPD
Chief Martin Pomeroy said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   And investigators believe that 4-year-old Jessica was continuously
in the custody of Patricia Cornejo for the 45 hours she was missing
this week, triggering a nationally chronicled search.</LD>
<LD>   That search ended happily Tuesday afternoon when Jessica was found
at a health clinic near USC.</LD>
<TE>   Cornejo, who police say acted alone, brought her there.</TE>
<TE>   As Jessica's parents continued to celebrate her safe return, and
clinic workers who rescued her were honored, police puzzled over what
motivated the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how you can understand why [Cornejo] might have done
this. We're struggling to do so, and as yet she has not informed us,"
Pomeroy said.</TE>
<TE>   The 34-year-old South-Central woman was described by acquaintances
as troubled and reclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators think Cornejo led Jessica away from Echo Park on
Sunday by means perhaps no more complicated "than holding her hand
and walking out of the park," Pomeroy said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that Cornejo did not know Jessica or her family before
the alleged kidnapping, and that Cornejo was cooperative with
investigators, telling them that she saw Jessica in the park and took
her home.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, her motives remain hazy, Pomeroy said.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica's mother and father, Maria Hernandez and Rafael Cortez,
appeared in Echo Park on Wednesday to thank police and area residents
for their help.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said she never lost hope that Jessica would be found.</TE>
<TE>   "We waited two days and two nights for this. Now she's back,"
Maria Hernandez said, at times cradling Jessica.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica was dressed in a frock and blue sandals, and still wearing
her hospital bracelet.</TE>
<TE>   She appeared unfazed and spent part of the news conference
occupied with crayons and paper.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said Jessica seemed mostly upset that her hair had been
cut, and was otherwise healthy.</TE>
<TE>   She may have spent some of the time she was away in Cornejo's
yellow, one-bedroom bungalow, acquaintances said.</TE>
<TE>   The bungalow is behind a chain-link fence a few feet from roaring
traffic just east of the Harbor Freeway and south of Martin Luther
King Jr. Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo lived there with two daughters, ages 4 and 10, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Landlord Abel Garcia said he was moved by pity to rent the
$600-per-month unit to Cornejo earlier this year without the usual
credit or background checks. "She kind of touched my heart," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo told him she had a troubled past and lived on welfare, and
complained of unhappiness.</TE>
<TE>   She sometimes behaved erratically, and seldom left her home, often
sleeping until the afternoon, Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   The bungalow was filthy, he said, but Cornejo's girls were polite
and seemed well-tended.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Cornejo complained to Garcia that the other tenants were
laughing at her.</TE>
<TE>   And occasionally, when he came to collect her rent, she wouldn't
speak or look at him, opening the door just wide enough to slip a
money order through, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eligia Garcia, 10, his daughter, is one of several children at the
complex who say they saw Cornejo on Tuesday afternoon with a third
child--a girl no one had seen before.</TE>
<TE>   Eligia said she saw Cornejo walk down the concrete paths that
separate the bungalows holding the new girl's hand.</TE>
<TE>   The girl did not seemed distressed or frightened, she added. "She
seemed OK with it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As of Wednesday morning, investigators had not interviewed
Jessica.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a complete story, but we didn't push. We showed
some compassion," Pomeroy said. "We will interview her when the time
is right."</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo's daughters were taken into protective custody, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   She has two sons, ages 14 and 8, who live with their father.</TE>
<TE>   News of Jessica's rescue prompted strangers to shower gifts of
candy and flowers on the workers at St. John's Well Child Center,
where Jessica was found.</TE>
<TE>   Denise Leon, a clinic receptionist with two days on the job, told
reporters Wednesday that she had felt there was something suspicious
about Cornejo as soon as she walked into the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo was wearing sunglasses, a red blazer, jeans and high
heels, Leon said.</TE>
<TE>   She told clerks that the girl she had brought with her had a sore
throat.</TE>
<TE>   Leon thought from the first that the girl looked like Jessica. But
co-workers were skeptical, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they agreed the pair were out of the ordinary. Cornejo
wouldn't sign a consent form.</TE>
<TE>   And the girl seemed to speak only Spanish, while Cornejo appeared
to be a native English speaker, and took offense when clinic workers
offered to interpret.</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo was being held Wednesday in a South-Central booking
facility on suspicion of kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Police are expected to ask the district attorney to file charges
today.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnapping charge carries a $500,000 bail requirement.</TE>

<HD>Ex-D.A. Garcetti Named to Ethics Panel</HD>
<DH>Appointment: His experience enforcing campaign laws is
cited by the council president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla named former Los
Angeles County district attorney Gil Garcetti to the city Ethics
Commission on Wednesday, saying that his political and prosecutorial
experience would be an asset to the watchdog panel.</LD>
<LD>   Garcetti, who lost a reelection bid for district attorney in 2000,
said he looks forward to serving on the panel. As a commissioner, he
would weigh the ethics of any action involving Los Angeles' elected
officials, one of whom is his son, Councilman Eric Garcetti.</LD>
<LD>   If confirmed by the council, the elder Garcetti said he would
recuse himself from any matter involving his son, who represents
Hollywood. Similarly, Eric Garcetti said Tuesday that he will not
vote on his father's confirmation.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt this was one commission I could bring some of my own
experience and expertise to and assist the commission in reaching its
goals," Gil Garcetti said. "This is an important time in this nation
in terms of issues of ethics and integrity."</TE>
<TE>   The Ethics Commission was created in 1990 to administer and
enforce city campaign finance and ethics laws. It has levied stiff
fines against City Council members for violations.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said he picked Garcetti in part because of Garcetti's
experience as a prosecutor who has enforced laws against elected
officials. Padilla said he also thought it would be good to have a
former elected official on the panel--something that has never
happened before.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good perspective to have on the commission," Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti's appointment was lauded by Bob Stern, a coauthor of the
state Political Reform Act and head of the Center for Governmental
Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrific appointment," Stern said. "He has a lot of
experience in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti was district attorney from 1992 to 2000. Before that, he
was head of the office's Special Investigations Division, which
investigated and prosecuted public employees.</TE>
<TE>   Stern and Ethics Commission Executive Director LeeAnn Pelham said
they do not believe that Garcetti would face a legal conflict
requiring recusal on an issue involving his son. But Stern said he
would hope that Garcetti would not get involved in any enforcement
action against the councilman, "although I don't expect there to be
one."</TE>
<TE>   Stern said he saw no reason for Garcetti to recuse himself from
acting on broader ethics rules that apply to all elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have had trouble in recent weeks finding appointees
to the Ethics Commission because of a rule that members cannot become
involved in the secession campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner David Fleming, an appointee of City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo, stepped down because of the rule, and the Rev. Cecil
Murray declined Delgadillo's appointment so he could fight secession.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti, who would be the only Latino on the panel if confirmed
by the City Council, said he opposes secession but does not plan to
take part in the anti-breakup campaign.</TE>

<HD>Glendale Considers New Protections for Tenants</HD>
<DH>Housing: Ordinance lists 11 reasons for evictions and
proposes stiffer penalties for landlords.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Glendale City Council is considering an ordinance that would make
it tougher for landlords to evict tenants.</LD>
<LD>   In a rental market defined by few vacancies and high rents,
council members and tenants are calling on landlords to provide "good
cause" to evict. Also, landlords would face stiffer penalties for
evicting tenants, reducing services or hiking rents in response to a
tenant's complaints.</LD>
<LD>   Landlords prosecuted under state law for retaliatory evictions can
already be fined up to $1,000.</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposed city law, landlords could face additional fines
of up to $500 and possibly a misdemeanor conviction resulting in up
to six months in jail, City Atty. Scott Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   "A tenant can exercise their rights [under state law], but they
can also use the provisions of our code, which would be a little
broader," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed ordinance gives 11 reasons a landlord can evict,
including nonpayment of rent, allowing additional occupants to live
in the apartment without the landlord's approval, and use of the
property to conduct illegal activity.</TE>
<TE>   "If the landlord can't meet one of the criteria for [evicting a
tenant] justly, then there are now ways to get to that landlord,"
Councilman Dave Weaver said. "If you double the rent, we can get to
you. Or if a landlord says, 'I want to get you out to get someone
else in,' they have to explain why."</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Glendale have a critically low vacancy rate, but its
rents are among the top third in Los Angeles County, said Ray Vargas,
a city housing administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the tight market, tenants are afraid of losing their
apartments, said Mike Allen, spokesman for the tenants' rights group
Glendale Housing Crisis Forum.</TE>
<TE>   This means, Allen said, "a lot of tenants are afraid to ask for
repairs, to speak at City Council or call city housing departments to
have an inspection," for fear they might end up on the street.</TE>
<TE>   If the proposed ordinance is approved Tuesday, a tenant "can't be
evicted for doing these things," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   Property managers and their representatives, however, don't see
the proposed ordinance as a cure-all.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Molano, president of the Glendale Apartment Assn., which
represents property owners and management firms, said landlords who
evict tenants indiscriminately should face penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Landlords who aren't malicious but simply do a poor job screening
prospective tenants shouldn't be stuck with bad tenants, Molano said.
"We know that the objectives are honorable, but the manner at which
it was directed was quite disadvantageous to our industry."</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Weaver said it's not the good landlords who should
worry. "Any landlord that is doing the right thing by their tenants
has nothing to fear," he said.</TE>

<HD>High-Rise Tenants in Limbo</HD>
<DH>Hollywood: Since electrical fire forced closure, safety and
blame issues remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Time stands still inside the landmark Hollywood high-rise at the
corner of Sunset and Vine.</LD>
<LD>   Unfinished work is spread out on desks lined with computers, fax
machines and family photos. Bookcases and file cabinets line office
walls, beneath calendars turned to December and clocks with hands
frozen at 1:35.</LD>
<LD>   It's been that way at 6290 Sunset Blvd. since Dec. 6, when an
electrical fire plunged the 20-story building into darkness and sent
employees of 40 companies with offices there running for safety.</LD>
<TE>   The office tower has remained padlocked ever since as disputes
continue over who is to blame for the electrical problem and whether
the building is safe to enter.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle are tenants who have been unable to remove
their office equipment, files and personal belongings from the
high-rise, which also housed two radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   The tenants' situation turned desperate last week when it was
learned that squatters had broken into the tower and were vandalizing
some of the abandoned suites.</TE>
<TE>   Protective fencing around the building, ordered by Los Angeles
officials in hopes of keeping trespassers out, was being installed
Wednesday. And the finger-pointing that has gone on for more than
eight months continued.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unbelievable situation, an utter catastrophe," said
Thomas Hunter Russell, an attorney who had offices in the tower for
26 years. "Nobody seems to give a damn about what's happening to
people in that building. I've been a trial lawyer for 37 years, and
I've never seen anything like this."</TE>
<TE>   City building and fire officials have allowed workers to return
briefly to their offices for important papers. But the elevators
don't work, which means that equipment has to be carried down stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Professional movers have quoted prices of up to $1,200 to remove a
single copy machine from upper floors.</TE>
<TE>   Russell said he paid a work crew $25,000 to tote legal files and
computers from his 10th-floor offices. But thousands of dollars worth
of other equipment and furnishings remain.</TE>
<TE>   "I carried my own computer down 16 stories," said an executive of
radio station KWKW-AM (1330). The station has moved to a temporary
new location but is still waiting to get its studio equipment out of
the tower, the manager said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants say their problems began when an underground electrical
transformer next to the building's subterranean parking garage blew
up and caught fire shortly after lunch on Dec. 6. The explosion
knocked out power to elevators, and workers fled down stairwells.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, city officials posted notices that the building was
unsafe to enter.</TE>
<TE>   Building owner Roy Mehdizadeh blames the city for the tenants'
problem. He said the Department of Water and Power's transformer
failed and then officials refused to reconnect power, "even for one
elevator so people could get their computers and faxes out."</TE>
<TE>   Mehdizadeh, whose family purchased the 39-year-old building in
1994, said he suspects that the transformer explosion, which he said
was one of several last year in Hollywood, was caused by an
electrical surge from the Kodak Theatre construction site at the
corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But
other city officials dismissed that scenario, and said the tower's
closure was ordered because of safety concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want another fire to happen," said City Councilman Eric
Garcetti, who represents that area.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a fit place for people to go into. We feel if the
power was turned on, we'd risk another electrical fire. That building
could go up, and perhaps people would lose their lives. That was
unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Before the blast, the city attorney's office had investigated
complaints that the high-rise lacked fire sprinklers and had ordered
their installation, Garcetti said. The electrical fire served to
underscore the severity of the problem, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some tenants suggest that an improperly installed air conditioner
in the office tower caused the transformer to short-circuit, a
contention that Mehdizadeh denies.</TE>
<TE>   Tenant Jerry Schneiderman, a real estate developer and community
activist, said that months before the fire, he wrote city officials
to warn that patrons of a nightclub on the top floor of the building
would be at risk in case of fire.</TE>
<TE>   Since being forced out of their offices, Schneiderman and other
tenants have formed a group and filed a lawsuit against Mehdizadeh
and his partners seeking reimbursement for their lockout.</TE>
<TE>   Mehdizadeh, who said he is suing the city over the explosion, said
the tenants' action threatens to block the sale of the building to a
new owner who can reopen it.</TE>
<TE>   The building is in escrow to the CIM real estate investment
company for the reported price of $7.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, CIM principal Shaul Kuba confirmed the pending sale
but declined to release the planned purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   Neighboring business owners say they will be relieved when the
building reopens.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a ghost tower. The squatters have moved in and turned it
into the world's biggest crack house," said Miki Jackson, who can see
graffiti on the high-rise's windows from the nonprofit AIDS
organization she runs on Vine Street.</TE>
<TE>   City officials will be happy, too.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Department representative Cal Muthleb was at the building
this week to issue permits to tenants who want to be escorted inside.
He said one tenant struggled for nearly an hour to move a table down
the stairs.</TE>
<TE>   "People come here with tears in their eyes," Muthleb said. "They
say they're about to lose their homes because of this."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a moving crew, Muthleb said, "I tell them they need a
lawyer."</TE>

<HD>Senate Passes Gun Liability Bill</HD>
<DH>Capitol: The measure would revoke immunity of manufacturers
to lawsuits over deaths, injuries or damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Senate narrowly voted Wednesday to strip gun manufacturers of
their exemption from liability for the damage and death that can
result from firearms.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the bill said gun makers should be held responsible
for their products, as are the manufacturers of many other goods in
California, from cribs to lawnmowers.</LD>
<LD>   Approval of the bill marked a leap forward for gun control
advocates, whose initial campaign to strip away gun makers'
19-year-old liability exemption stalled last year.</LD>
<TE>   On a party-line 22-13 vote, one more than needed in the 40-member
Senate, AB 496 by Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood) was
passed and returned to the Assembly for approval of Senate
amendments.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly, meantime, is expected to vote soon on an identical
bill, SB 682, by Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda), a leading gun control
advocate. The proposals are sponsored by the Brady Campaign to
Prevent Gun Violence.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said the governor has not taken a
position on the bills.</TE>
<TE>   In his first year in office, Davis signed several far-reaching gun
control bills, then imposed a moratorium on comprehensive new
firearms laws. He has signed only a few bills since then.</TE>
<TE>   The immunity legislation would have the effect of overturning a
ruling last year by the state Supreme Court. The court upheld the gun
manufacturers' shield against product liability challenges for damage
caused by criminals and others who misuse firearms.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in a case filed by survivors and relatives of
those who were shot in a massacre at a San Francisco high-rise law
office in 1993. Armed with a pair of semiautomatic pistols capable of
firing 32 rounds each without reloading, the gunman, Gian Luigi
Ferri, killed eight people and wounded six. As police closed in,
Ferri killed himself.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs sued the manufacturer of the guns, Navegar Inc.,
for damages, noting that the two TEC-DC9 pistols were knockoffs of
assault weapons that had been outlawed in California.</TE>
<TE>   When the case reached the high court, justices ruled in favor of
Navegar, saying the company was properly protected by the industry's
exemption. If the Legislature wanted to change it, it was empowered
to do so, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   The immunity law essentially says that guns and ammunition are
exempt from product liability attacks because the value of their
benefits outweighs their potential for causing serious injury, damage
or death.</TE>
<TE>   During debate, Perata insisted Wednesday that the bill was not
"aimed at taking anyone's gun away," but was intended to hold gun
manufacturers legally accountable for their products in the same
fashion as other manufacturers are held liable.</TE>
<TE>   He said Navegar made appeals to criminals in the promotion of the
TEC-DC9, including advertising it as "fingerprint resistant" and
"able to fire without aiming."</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans, led by Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside), attacked
the plan as another assault on gun ownership and an attempt to pin
the blame for misuse of guns by criminals on the manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are saying here is that it is not the criminal's fault;
it is the manufacturer's fault," Haynes argued. "This takes the issue
of personal responsibility and turns it on its ear."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena), whose adult son was killed in an
accidental shooting several years ago, countered that guns kill
30,000 Americans a year. "If you do something that is irresponsible
and terribly harmful to the public, there is a price to pay," Scott
said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was supported by the Million Mom March, the city and
county of Los Angeles, California police chiefs, trial lawyers and
various medical and health organizations. It was opposed by the
California Rifle and Pistol Assn., the National Rifle Assn. and other
gun-owner organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The National Shooting Sports Federation, a trade organization that
says it represents the firearms industry, did not take a position on
the bill. Its officials were unavailable for comment.</TE>

<HD>City Council Votes to Ban Sales of Drug Items Near Schools</HD>
<DH>Safety: Mayor Hahn is expected to sign the ordinance that
also would bar juveniles from entering stores that sell the
paraphernalia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH and MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance Wednesday that
outlaws the sale of drug paraphernalia near schools, libraries, parks
and religious buildings and bans juveniles from entering so-called
"head shops."</LD>
<LD>   The law, which will take effect in September, stemmed from the
opening of a shop across from Fairfax High School in Hollywood that
sells pipes for smoking marijuana, as well as posters and T-shirts
that promote drug use. That store and others already doing business
are exempt from the new law.</LD>
<LD>   Existing head shops, however, will have to comply with the new
law's ban on juveniles entering their stores without a parent or
guardian.</LD>
<TE>   Previously, city law barred anyone younger than 18 from areas of
stores where drug paraphernalia was displayed but not from the whole
store.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who sponsored the head shop ban, said it is
another way to promote a just-say-no message to children.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids these days know that they're supposed to resist drugs
... but we as a society have to try to do our best to lower the
temptation level and lower the exploitation level," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting Wednesday to the new law, owners of head shops said the
stricter regulations on their businesses are unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   They already keep out kids, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the same type of business as liquor stores. We do not
cater to youths," said Gabbie Lizzoli, manager of Chronic Pleasures
in North Hollywood, which is several blocks from Victory Boulevard
Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles does not have a similar law regulating liquor stores,
but those businesses must have permits to operate. The city can deny
a permit based on the store's location.</TE>
<TE>   The new head shop law is modeled after the city's ordinance
regulating the zoning of adult businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Stores that sell devices for smoking or ingesting marijuana,
hashish, cocaine and other drugs cannot open within 500 feet of
schools, public libraries, parks, churches, mosques, synagogues or
other religious buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn said it is important to keep drug
paraphernalia out of sight of kids when they leave school in the
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the time of the day that they begin to experiment," Hahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new ordinance requires the signature of her brother, Mayor
James K. Hahn, who is expected to sign it.</TE>
<TE>   It would become law 30 days later.</TE>

<HD>3 Female Inmates Say Jail Is Rat-Infested</HD>
<DH>Court: Declarations are filed in Santa Ana as part of
earlier prisoners' rights group action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The women's section of the Orange County Jail is a rat-infested place
where inmates are watched by male guards as they shower, according to
declarations filed Wednesday as part of a contempt action against the
Sheriff's Department brought by a Sacramento-based prisoners' rights
group.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like living in a dungeon," Richard P. Herman, a Laguna Beach
attorney representing the Prisoners' Rights Union, said of conditions
at the jail. "It's a vermin-infested facility unfit for human
habitation. It's not a place you'd ever want to be."</LD>
<LD>   Jon Fleischman, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, said
department policy prevented him from commenting on the specifics of
the case. But, he added, "We stand by our record as one of the
best-run jail systems in the country. We will respond to these
allegations in court. We ask that members of the public not base
their opinions on allegations, but what's proven in a court of law.
We have full faith in our jail system."</LD>
<TE>   The declarations, by three female inmates, are part of a larger
action filed last month charging the department with contempt for
failing to maintain certain court-ordered prisoners' rights,
including access to a day room, 15-minute meal periods, time in the
chapel, adequate exercise, access to telephones, freedom from racial
or ethnic slurs and freedom from violence or the threat of its use.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's declarations, filed in the U.S. District Court in
Santa Ana, specifically contend that the rats in the women's jail are
so plentiful that inmates have to swat them with towels or place
boxes under the doors of their cells to keep them out--an action that
is considered a rules violation for which they are then penalized.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the declarations said, the women are routinely
threatened with violence and observed by male guards while in the
showers.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line," Herman said, "is that brutality is the system
and the jailers aren't willing to give it up. [This action] is about
looking at people in the jail as human beings and treating them
decently."</TE>

<HD>Teen Who Fled Juvenile Hall Is Recaptured</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 16-year-old youth who escaped from custody last week after he was
taken to a clinic for medical attention has been recaptured,
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Frazier was arrested in Compton after authorities received
a tip, according to Chief Probation Officer Richard Shumsky.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to thank the citizens, [Compton] school police, and I am
especially appreciative of the work of two of our probation
staffers," Shumsky said.</LD>
<TE>   Frazier escaped from a probation guard at a clinic associated with
the County-USC Medical Center, within walking distance of Central
Juvenile Hall on Eastlake Avenue, where he was being held, Los
Angeles police said.</TE>
<TE>   He was the fourth young inmate to escape from Juvenile Hall's
custody in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County supervisors told probation officials Tuesday to
work with county health officials to provide health care for
juveniles within the walls of juvenile halls.</TE>

<HD>Council Rookie Is an Unabashed L.A. Fan</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In office just 10 months, Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge has
quickly established himself as a sort of Paul Bunyan of the
bureaucracy.</LD>
<LD>   Heard about the time ol' Tom LaBonge came upon a family from
Washington state lost in a Griffith Park canyon? He led them out to
safety--and Universal Studios--and left them with a book about L.A.
that he keeps in his trunk.</LD>
<LD>   Hey, has LaBonge ever called you from the road? You know what that
ding-ding-ding sound is? He's stopped the car, opened the door
and--get this--he's picking up trash.</LD>
<TE>   And what about the time LaBonge stopped by a seniors center and
launched into Elvis' "Can't Help Falling in Love"?</TE>
<TE>   It seems everyone at City Hall has a story about Tom LaBonge, and
they're not all tall tales. LaBonge, who used to drive dates across
the 6th Street bridge to gaze at L.A.'s industrial yards, will go to
any length to promote his hometown and its history. In council
meetings, he scans the audience for international tourists so he can
welcome them to "the great city of Los Angeles" and its "beautiful
City Hall." If they happen to be from one of L.A.'s sister cities,
you can bet LaBonge will grab them for a photo. He hands out so many
commendations that the city's calligraphers have to stay late to keep
up.</TE>
<TE>   Despite 27 years as a city employee, LaBonge still marvels at the
most mundane functions of Los Angeles. Last week, he made two trips
to a garbage dump, just to show it off.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge's cheerleading often starts eyes rolling around the City
Council's horseshoe desk. He is not an ideologue or a grand thinker.
But if you need that pesky pothole patched, call (213) 485-3337. And
don't be surprised if LaBonge himself answers the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "He was absolutely made to be a councilman in the city of Los
Angeles," said LaBonge's chief of field operations, Rory Fitzpatrick,
who grew up across the street from the councilman in a Silver Lake
neighborhood that is part of LaBonge's 4th District. The district
ranges into Los Feliz, parts of Hollywood, North Hollywood and other
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Before his election last October, LaBonge had done fieldwork for
Mayor Tom Bradley, Council President John Ferraro and Mayor Richard
Riordan. After Ferraro died last year, LaBonge won the special
election for Ferraro's council seat.</TE>
<TE>   Through his career, he has avoided wonkish policy debates in favor
of street-level service--a mind-set that has become popular once
again as City Hall tries to quell secessionist sentiment in Hollywood
and the San Fernando Valley. If Los Angeles breaks apart, "the sun
would rise and all the other things would happen," LaBonge said, "but
it would personally hurt me."</TE>
<TE>   Tall and softer than in his days of playing football, with his
silvery hair combed back, LaBonge can abruptly turn council
discussions of ordinances and dry city business to his favorite
topics. Standing, one hand in his pocket, he'll laud L.A.'s parks,
the 1984 Olympics and the Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   He's not the only council member who grew up in Los Angeles, but
he is the only one who repeatedly mentions his high school (John
Marshall). Anyone who meets LaBonge gets two questions: Where do you
live, and where'd you go to high school?</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about the neighborhood.... Los Angeles to you could be
Toluca Lake, it could be San Pedro, it could be Sherman Oaks, it
could be Venice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Conversations with LaBonge bounce around the city. In a 15-minute
interview, he managed to bring up Foster's Freeze in Boyle Heights,
his Irish Catholic grandfather who was a police officer, and how his
grandparents on the German side lived downtown where City Hall stands
now.</TE>
<TE>   He remembered buying ice cream in Larchmont Village for a group of
nuns and how he never goes anywhere without a loaf of their pumpkin
bread. Somehow that anecdote recalled an encounter with Hugh Hefner
over Pink's chili dogs in Hollywood, the 44 pobladores who settled
Los Angeles in 1781 and how the L.A. River determined the city's
siting.</TE>
<TE>   As he does in council meetings, LaBonge praised "the great William
Mulholland" and how the engineer brought water to the city from the
Sierra. He talked about his own photography exhibits, local TV legend
Stan Chambers and City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, a "great graduate" of
rival Franklin High School in Highland Park.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge said his 4-year-old son, Charles, knows that if the
firetrucks are speeding down Silver Lake Boulevard from the north,
they're from Station 56. From the south, they're from Station 35.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge's daughter, Mary-Catherine, is "a great public speaker,"
he said. And she's 8.</TE>
<TE>   Called to jury duty last week, LaBonge couldn't resist stopping by
the council's chambers to greet audience members there. He asked them
to be patient while they waited for enough council members to arrive
to start the meeting, and suggested that they pass the time by
staring at the room's "beautiful ceiling."</TE>
<TE>   When he got to the Hollywood courthouse, LaBonge said, he felt the
need to point out to the judge and jurors that Hollywood Boulevard
had just been spiffed up by one of the city's "outstanding" street
crews. He knew it was Crew No. 152.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat right next to a constituent," LaBonge said. "Got to get her
street repaved."</TE>

<HD>Council Rookie Is an Unabashed L.A. Promoter</HD>
<DH>Government: He's no policy wonk, but the 4th District's Tom
LaBonge relishes his role as one of the city's No. 1 fans.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In office just 10 months, Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge has
quickly established himself as a sort of Paul Bunyan of the
bureaucracy.</LD>
<LD>   Heard about the time ol' Tom LaBonge came upon a family from
Washington state lost in a Griffith Park canyon? He led them out to
safety--and Universal Studios--and left them with a book about L.A.
that he keeps in his trunk.</LD>
<LD>   Hey, has LaBonge ever called you from the road? You know what that
ding-ding-ding sound is? He's stopped the car, opened the door
and--get this--he's picking up trash.</LD>
<TE>   And what about the time LaBonge stopped by a seniors center and
launched into Elvis' "Can't Help Falling in Love"?</TE>
<TE>   It seems everyone at City Hall has a story about Tom LaBonge, and
they're not all tall tales. LaBonge, who used to drive dates across
the 6th Street bridge to gaze at L.A.'s industrial yards, will go to
any length to promote his hometown and its history. In council
meetings, he scans the audience for international tourists so he can
welcome them to "the great city of Los Angeles" and its "beautiful
City Hall." If they happen to be from one of L.A.'s sister cities,
you can bet LaBonge will grab them for a photo. He hands out so many
commendations that the city's calligraphers have to stay late to keep
up.</TE>
<TE>   Despite 27 years as a city employee, LaBonge still marvels at the
most mundane functions of Los Angeles. Last week, he made two trips
to a garbage dump, just to show it off.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge's cheerleading often starts eyes rolling around the City
Council's horseshoe desk. He is not an ideologue or a grand thinker.
But if you need that pesky pothole patched, call (213) 485-3337. And
don't be surprised if LaBonge himself answers the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "He was absolutely made to be a councilman in the city of Los
Angeles," said LaBonge's chief of field operations, Rory Fitzpatrick,
who grew up across the street from the councilman in a Silver Lake
neighborhood that is part of LaBonge's 4th District. The district
ranges into Los Feliz, parts of Hollywood, North Hollywood and other
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Before his election last October, LaBonge had done fieldwork for
Mayor Tom Bradley, Council President John Ferraro and Mayor Richard
Riordan. After Ferraro died last year, LaBonge won the special
election for Ferraro's council seat.</TE>
<TE>   Through his career, he has avoided wonkish policy debates in favor
of street-level service--a mind-set that has become popular once
again as City Hall tries to quell secessionist sentiment in Hollywood
and the San Fernando Valley. If Los Angeles breaks apart, "the sun
would rise and all the other things would happen," LaBonge said, "but
it would personally hurt me."</TE>
<TE>   Tall and softer than in his days of playing football, with his
silvery hair combed back, LaBonge can abruptly turn council
discussions of ordinances and dry city business to his favorite
topics. Standing, one hand in his pocket, he'll laud L.A.'s parks,
(especially Griffith Park, where he hikes nearly every morning), the
1984 Olympics and the fire department.</TE>
<TE>   He's not the only council member who grew up in Los Angeles, but
he is the only one who repeatedly mentions his high school (John
Marshall in Los Feliz) during meetings. Anyone who meets LaBonge gets
two questions: Where do you live, and where'd you go to high school?</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about the neighborhood.... Los Angeles to you could be
Toluca Lake, it could be San Pedro, it could be Sherman Oaks, it
could be Venice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Conversations with LaBonge bounce around the city. In a 15-minute
interview, he managed to bring up Foster's Freeze in Boyle Heights,
his Irish Catholic grandfather who was a police officer and how his
grandparents on the German side lived downtown where City Hall stands
now.</TE>
<TE>   He remembered buying ice cream in Larchmont Village for a group of
nuns and how he never goes anywhere without a loaf of their pumpkin
bread. Somehow that anecdote recalled an encounter with Hugh Hefner
over Pink's chili dogs in Hollywood, the 44 pobladores who settled
Los Angeles in 1781 and how the L.A. River determined the city's
siting.</TE>
<TE>   As he does in council meetings, LaBonge praised "the great William
Mulholland" and how the engineer brought water to the city from the
Sierra. He talked about his own photography exhibits, local TV legend
Stan Chambers and City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, a "great graduate" of
rival Franklin High School in Highland Park.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge said his 4-year-old son, Charles, knows that if the
firetrucks are speeding down Silver Lake Boulevard from the north,
they're from Station 56. From the south, they're from Station 35.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves the Fire Department and, just like his daddy," his
favorite day is Thursday," LaBonge said, "because that's trash day,
and he gets to see those beautiful city trucks come through the
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge's daughter, Mary-Catherine, is "a great public speaker,"
he said. And she's 8.</TE>
<TE>   Called to jury duty last week, LaBonge couldn't resist stopping by
the council's chambers to greet audience members there. He asked them
to be patient while they waited for enough council members to arrive
to start the meeting and suggested that they pass the time by staring
at the room's "beautiful ceiling."</TE>
<TE>   When he got to the Hollywood courthouse, LaBonge said, he felt the
need to point out to the judge and jurors that Hollywood Boulevard
had just been spiffed up by one of the city's "outstanding" street
crews. He knew it was Crew No. 152.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat right next to a constituent," LaBonge said. "Got to get her
street repaved."</TE>

<LD>A team of Southern California researchers received a $640,000 grant
from the University of California Office of the President to study
how wetlands affect pollution levels along the coast. Though wetlands
are typically thought of as natural filters, recent studies found
that bird droppings in Talbert Marsh contribute to high bacteria
levels in Huntington Beach. Stanley Grant and Brett Sanders of UC
Irvine will join the researchers.</LD>

<HD>Official Deals Setback to Own Reelection Bid</HD>
<DH>Santa Paula: Filing deadline is missed by councilwoman,
forcing her to turn to courts to win a ballot spot or wage a write-in
campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She is a longtime advocate of ethnic diversity on the Santa Paula
City Council, but incumbent Laura Flores Espinosa has made it more
difficult for one Latino to get elected in November. Herself.</LD>
<LD>   Espinosa missed a filing deadline last week for council incumbents
seeking reelection.</LD>
<LD>   To compete with at least five other candidates vying for three
seats, she must either obtain a judge's order permitting her name to
appear on the Nov. 5 ballot or mount a write-in campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Both are uphill battles, a political analyst said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Lawsuits are expensive and don't always go your way, and write-in
candidates rarely win," said Herb Gooch, chairman of the political
science department at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. "Talk
about shooting yourself in the foot."</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa's fumble, ironically, comes as Santa Paula considers
changing to a district voting system to increase Latino
representation on the council.</TE>
<TE>   A measure on the fall ballot asks voters whether the council's
five members should be elected from separate districts or continue to
be elected citywide.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative was prompted by a U.S. Department of Justice
lawsuit that faulted the city's current at-large system for keeping
low the number of Latino council members in a city where Latinos
represent two-thirds of the city's population and 52% of registered
voters.</TE>
<TE>   After spending $500,000 to defend the city, the council agreed
late last year to settle the lawsuit by putting the issue before
voters in November.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa was the only Latino candidate at the time the suit was
filed, but has since been joined by Mayor Ray Luna.</TE>
<TE>   At least one other Latino is seeking a council seat in November.
Al Escoto, a former councilman and mayor, is a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Gabino Aguirre, a high school educator, took out candidacy papers
early Wednesday but it was uncertain whether he had filed by the 5
p.m. deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates are incumbent Rick Cook, seeking a second term;
Rita Graham, a land-use planner; Mary Ann Krause, an urban planner;
and real estate agent John Wisda.</TE>
<TE>   Because Councilman Donald Johnson announced he would not seek
another term, the Friday filing deadline was extended for five
days--but only for challengers, County Clerk Richard Dean said.</TE>
<TE>   Cook got his papers in on time but Espinosa did not, Dean said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Santa Paula City Clerk Steve Salas allowed Espinosa to
submit her candidacy documents Wednesday, Dean said he would reject
them when they come to county offices.</TE>
<TE>   The county Elections Division has the final say on which documents
are appropriately filed, the county clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   "The extensions do not apply to incumbents," Dean said. "That's
the way we have always interpreted elections law and that's the way
it's been interpreted up and down the state."</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa said the filing lapse was a simple misunderstanding and
is prepared to take legal action to correct it. Election law is
ambiguous on filing deadlines, she contends.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, it would have been easier if I had filed the day I
pulled my papers," the two-term incumbent said. "But there was never
any doubt of my intention. I am the front-runner. I've printed my
campaign literature. I've walked precincts. I've organized voter
registration drives. So this issue points to intent as well."</TE>
<TE>   Dean said he would not oppose a lawsuit, but said his office must
have a court order by Wednesday so it can begin printing ballots.</TE>
<TE>   If she fails in the courts, Espinosa said she will still run as a
write-in candidate.</TE>
<TE>   She met with her campaign team Wednesday and, she said, was urged
to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unanimous--'Go for it,' " she said. "We know it will be
difficult. But Santa Paula is worth fighting for."</TE>

<HD>Federal Court Backs State's Sex Offender Registration</HD>
<DH>Appeal: Panel overturns decision that freed a man who gave
police his new address when rearrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal appellate justices Wednesday upheld California's requirement
that a sex offender must register with local police after release
from prison, overturning a lower court ruling.</LD>
<LD>   "The purpose is so law enforcement knows where convicted sex
offenders live and can check up on them," said Supervising Deputy
Atty. Gen. Robert Foster, applauding the ruling.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came in the case of Avelino Mendez, now 39, who was
convicted of attempted rape in Victorville in 1982 and required by
law to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.</LD>
<TE>   He was detained for marijuana possession in 1996 and, as a result,
was charged and convicted of failing to tell police about his most
recent move. The conviction was a third strike for Mendez, who was
sentenced to 25 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   Mendez's attorneys persuaded a federal judge last year that he
should not have been returned to prison for failing to register
because he had provided his current address during an earlier arrest.</TE>
<TE>   With his conviction overturned, he was released from prison and
deported to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Mendez's attorneys argued that he had followed the law because he
had given his new address when arrested in April 1995 for spousal
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Brennan, a clinical law professor at the USC Law School
who argued today's case before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
said that arrest fell within the time limit for notifying authorities
that Mendez had moved.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan argued that under Wednesday's ruling, Mendez, when
released from custody, would have had to leave the sheriff's station,
then immediately return and provide the same background information
to the deputies who had booked him.</TE>
<TE>   "The deputies would have laughed at him," Brennan said.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, state law required sex offenders to notify the local
law enforcement agency with whom they were registered within 10 days
of changing their home address. They now must register annually.</TE>
<TE>   "A reasonable person would know that there is a difference between
merely stating one's current address and providing notice of a new
address," states Wednesday's ruling, was written by Judge Barry G.
Silverman with Judges Arthur L. Alarcon and Johnnie B. Rawlinson.</TE>
<TE>   The federal appellate court, Foster said, made it clear that
providing authorities with an updated address during a routine
booking procedure for a new crime is insufficient under state law.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it reflects how seriously we consider sex crimes," Foster
said, noting that sentencing judges and prison officials advise sex
offenders that they must register their whereabouts for life.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit opinion noted that a California appellate court in
1999 had upheld Mendez's conviction on an earlier appeal.</TE>
<TE>   That opinion, however, was overturned last year when U.S. District
Court Judge Robert J. Timlin in Riverside found that Mendez's due
process right was violated.</TE>
<TE>   The judge concluded that Mendez had not been given fair notice of
what the sex offender registration law required.</TE>
<TE>   Mendez, a Mexican citizen, was then released from prison and
deported, his attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   With the new ruling, a warrant will probably be issued for his
arrest if he returns to the United States, Brennan said.</TE>

<HD>Police Seek Thief Who Posed as Cop</HD>
<DH>Crime: The man showed a badge before robbing a couple at a
Cerritos park. The city is offering a reward for a tip leading to his
conviction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheriff's detectives are looking for a man who impersonated a police
officer and robbed a couple sitting in their car at Cerritos Regional
Park early Sunday morning.</LD>
<LD>   The male victim, from Garden Grove, and his female companion, from
Hawaiian Gardens, were sitting at a secluded area of the park at
12:30 a.m. when the robber approached their vehicle, according to the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   The robber wore blue-jean shorts and a Seattle Mariners jersey,
but he flashed a police badge and ordered the couple out of their
vehicle. He threatened to arrest the couple if they didn't give him
money. He escaped on foot with an undisclosed amount. No injuries
were reported.</LD>
<TE>   The robber is described as mixed race with medium to dark skin. He
is about 35 years old, and 5 feet 7 with a stocky build. He has a
mustache, goatee and black hair pulled back in a ponytail. An
unidentified tattoo was spotted on one of his calves.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials said Regional Park is a popular hangout for young
couples, and they are concerned that the area might attract criminals
like the kidnapper of Antelope Valley teens Jacqueline Marris and
Tamara Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   "This incident is particularly disturbing because [this park] is a
notorious lovers lane area ... it hearkens back to what happened in
Lancaster," Cerritos Det. Chris Derry said. "We want to do everything
to catch this guy before he takes it to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to
the robber's arrest and conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call (562) 467-6817.</TE>

<HD>Monitoring of Coast Waters Is Questioned</HD>
<DH>Ocean pollution: Rapid fluctuations often result in clean
beaches being closed, O.C. study finds. But testing is defended as
the best available.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pollution levels in coastal waters fluctuate so wildly that current
monitoring efforts are largely futile, according to a study released
Wednesday by a team of Southern California researchers.</LD>
<LD>   Intensive testing of waters off Huntington Beach showed that hot
spots of contamination tended to disappear within 100 minutes. But
because of the lag time in getting water-sample test results, a beach
would be posted as off-limits 24 hours later, long after the
pollutants were gone. Yet the posting couldn't be lifted until
another sample tested clean--which takes another 24 hours because of
the limits of testing methods.</LD>
<LD>   In practical terms, that means beaches across Southern California
and around the nation are regularly being labeled "polluted" and
closed when they are clean, researchers said.</LD>
<TE>   But health experts and environmentalists say that despite its
flaws, current testing procedures are the best tools they have to
protect the public.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the economically devastating closures of
Huntington Beach's shoreline in 1999, scientists from UC Irvine,
Chapman University in Orange and the Orange County Sanitation
District analyzed 43 years of water testing data for the city's
beaches and conducted intensive tests over the past year. They
concluded that despite widespread public perceptions that coastal
waters are becoming increasingly degraded, water quality off
Huntington Beach has actually improved over the past four decades.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that improvement is tied to the 1972 Clean Water Act and
projects that help keep sewage and urban runoff from hitting the
water--from the sanitation district's construction of a new outfall
in 1971 farther offshore to storm-drain diversions in the late 1990s
that kept bacteria-laden runoff from hitting the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Water quality is getting better as money is being spent to
improve infrastructure," said UCI's Stanley Grant, one of eight
authors of the study published Wednesday on the Environmental Science
&amp; Technology journal Web site. Grant said this conclusion raised the
next question: If water quality is improving, why does it appear to
be getting worse?</TE>
<TE>   Numerous studies, including a report by the Natural Resources
Defense Council released last month, paint a grim picture. The 12th
annual "Testing the Waters" study showed that beach closures and
warnings due to pollution were up again across the nation and in the
state in 2001. Orange County led the way with 1,592 closures and
advisories in 2001--81% higher than the previous year, the NRDC
report said.</TE>
<TE>   Grant said the avalanche of new postings and closures was the
result of a state law that took effect three years ago, requiring
health officials to post warnings on beaches if bacteria levels
exceed a specified level in either a single water sample or in
several samples over a month. The law, regarded as the most stringent
in the nation, was intended to notify the public when the water was
unhealthful.</TE>
<TE>   "The postings are an artifact of the new regulations, which
wouldn't be a bad thing if the regulations were doing their job," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the lengthy analysis time for water samples brings
into question whether the law is doing what was intended.</TE>
<TE>   Using samples collected hourly as well as every 10 minutes,
researchers found that pollution levels fluctuate wildly, and
individual contamination hot spots tend to last less than 100
minutes. A test that shows a beach is dirty may not be valid two
hours later. This "has immediate practical implications for the
monitoring ... of coastal pollution," the study concluded. "Decisions
to post or close a beach should not be based on" a single sample that
exceeds standards. Instead, closures should be based on multiple
samples collected over a period of time.</TE>
<TE>   That conclusion was immediately questioned by environmentalists
and O.C. health officials.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a health and safety issue; we want to err on the side of
caution," said Christopher J. Evans, executive director of the
Surfrider Foundation. "Even though the [monitoring] isn't perfect, it
is the best we have right now."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Honeybourne, chief of the county Health Care Agency's water
quality program, said most of his agency's beach warnings are posted
on the basis of a single dirty sample. He conceded that could mean
clean beaches are being closed. Such situations, while unfortunate,
are necessary, he said. "It's the most protective of public health."</TE>
<TE>   Evans noted that a single dirty sample can herald the start of a
greater pollution problem, as it did when much of Huntington Beach's
shoreline was closed to the public for most of the summer of 1999.
Waiting for multiple dirty samples would have meant allowing people
to swim in dangerous water for weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grant said historical data also showed that the 1999 bacterial
pollution problems in Huntington Beach actually had been detected in
sampling dating to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Kiff, Newport Beach's assistant city manager, said the study
confirms what many coastal communities have long feared--that they
may be unfairly tarnished by an inaccurate monitoring system. He
urged the Legislature and county health officials along California's
1,100-mile coast to read the report.</TE>
<TE>   UCI's Grant said researchers across the nation are trying to
develop faster testing procedures, but even those would fail to catch
minute-by-minute bacterial fluctuations.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County Superior Court judge Wednesday refused to lower the
$1-million bail for cosmetics company heir Andrew Luster, who is
accused of drugging and raping three women at his seaside home.</LD>
<LD>   Luster, 38, free on bail but confined to his Mussel Beach home,
also asked Judge Bruce Clark for permission to leave his residence so
he could meet with his attorneys. Clark denied the request.</LD>
<LD>   Clark said if Luster wants to change the terms of his bail, he
should take it up with the 2nd District Court of Appeal, which set
his bail in December 2000 after Luster challenged the original
$10-million amount.</LD>
<TE>   Luster, great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max Factor, was
arrested two years ago on suspicion of using a date rape drug known
as GHB to sedate women and then sexually assault them.</TE>
<TE>   His trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 28.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of delays, a proposed $25-million car-processing plant
near Port Hueneme that could bring 250 jobs to Oxnard will be the
subject of a public hearing tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Vehicle Processors' plan goes before the Oxnard Planning
Commission as the company seeks approval to convert 38 vacant acres
south of Hueneme Road into a plant for preparing imported vehicles
before they are shipped to dealerships.</LD>
<LD>   The plant would allow the company to implement a new contract with
Volkswagen and its Audi luxury division to handle an additional
100,000 vehicles annually beginning next spring, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The plant would wash, repair and accessorize cars from Mexico and
Germany before they are loaded on trucks and trains destined for U.S.
showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic and environmental concerns from residents, wetlands
advocates and city officials have delayed the Planning Commission
hearing since January.</TE>
<TE>   The delays threatened the project, but the company has since
gained an extension on its contract with Volkswagen, said James
Kilpatrick, the company's vice president of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   If the commission approves the project, Pacific Vehicle Processors
would then seek City Council approval Sept. 17. Construction could
begin by October, Kilpatrick said.</TE>

<HD>... But Cut Political E-Mail Some Slack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE McCURRY and LARRY PURPURO</AU>
<BD>Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President
Clinton, is CEO of an advocacy management and communications software
firm. Larry Purpuro, the former Republican National Committee deputy
chief of staff, is founder and president of a political e-marketing
firm.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not many months from now, people across the country will experience
one of the great recurring features of American democracy. At
shopping malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our
front stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to
represent us in public office. While chances are high that we won't
know them personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and
a flier and ask for our votes.</LD>
<LD>   Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication,
it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with
voters.</LD>
<LD>   In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of
State Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the
e-mail addresses of more than a million potential California voters
and sent each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.</LD>
<TE>   That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional--and
more expensive--methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail,
radio spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message,
instead of 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another
medium.</TE>
<TE>   Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication
would have been equally "unsolicited," as defined in the e-mail
world. Few voters would have "opted in" to receive campaign
information from Jones through any of those channels.</TE>
<TE>   The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and
intense. He was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage
was almost entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics
could have been refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no
standard-practice "paid for" disclaimer in the message.</TE>
<TE>   His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues
but because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online
campaign may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism
toward money in politics--money typically spent on other unsolicited
communication mediums--Jones tried to level the playing field.</TE>
<TE>   No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and
can be highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated
society, it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very
different unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.</TE>
<TE>   The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in
Congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly
address spam. We believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct
mail, telemarketing or TV advertising when it comes to politicians
seeking to reach voters. A simple link in good e-mail campaigns
allows recipients to opt out of future mailings. Direct mail takes at
least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list, and viewers must
repeatedly endure TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can
use the Internet to provide constituents with information to better
prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes.
With more than 60% of all potential voters in this country possessing
e-mail accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this
medium.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered
by the Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today
that better ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to
specific recipient groups.</TE>
<TE>   But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a
voter an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message
without opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply
and engage the sender. That choice should belong to the voter--not to
anti-spam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial
e-mail. Political candidates should be free to communicate with
voters as best they can, and let voters decide what to do with that
information.</TE>

<HD>Aloofness Puts Bush on Right Side of History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton, who writes a column for Newsday in
New York, worked in the White House of former President Bush. E-mail:
pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What did you think of President Bush's Waco economic forum? The media
didn't think much of it. All day Tuesday, CNBC anchors could barely
report on the event without smirking. Just hours after it ended,
Slate.com's headline gibed, "Fake Forum." The next day, the
Washington Post's "analysis" was headlined this way: "A Sunny Thing
Happened at the Bush Forum / Tough Economic Issues Get Little
Attention."</LD>
<LD>   The overall gist of the reportage is that Bush is so detached from
ordinary Americans that his reelection-minded advisors felt they
needed to stage a show to fool people into thinking he really does
care.</LD>
<LD>   But maybe detachment is not so bad. Maybe it's what we need.</LD>
<TE>   History proves that leaders who kept their eyes on the
fundamentals of economic growth did a lot better than those who tried
to micromanage every problem.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Bush's distance extends to all aspects of his
presidency, not just economics. On Aug. 4, for example, the Texan was
in Kennebunkport, Maine, playing golf with his father, the former
president. Reacting to news of a terror bombing in Israel, he said,
"I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these
terrorist attacks. Thank you." Then he added, speaking of his golf
shot, "Now watch this drive."</TE>
<TE>   Now that's detached. And once upon a time, this style of
leadership was much admired.</TE>
<TE>   The French call it sang-froid--literally "cold blood," as in,
don't get too hot about things. In 1588, the legendary English sea
captain, Sir Francis Drake, was playing croquet when news came that
the Spanish Armada was nearing Britain, bent on conquest and
subjugation. Drake absorbed the news, then returned to his mallet,
saying, "There is plenty of time to win this game, and to thrash the
Spaniards too."</TE>
<TE>   Cool, indeed. Of course, what made it really cool was that Drake
wrapped up his match, got on his ship and destroyed the invading
fleet.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there's not much evidence that Bush is another Drake,
but in any case that froid-y style of leadership is out of fashion.
Instead of the stiff upper lip of a Winston Churchill, we seem to
want the bitten lip of a Bill Clinton. Indeed, with Clinton one also
got moist eyes and endless expressions of I-feel-your-pain
victimologizing.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the economy boomed under Clinton, leading some to
confuse good empathy with good policy. Yet the economic recovery that
he rode upward through the '90s actually began in the second quarter
of 1991, almost two years before he took office.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, if Clinton is going to be credited for the productive
activity of 280 million Americans, then he must also be blamed for
the corrupt activities of a corporate few, wheedling and deedling on
his watch.</TE>
<TE>   According to official government findings, the financial
skulduggery at Adelphia, Arthur Andersen, Enron, Global Crossing,
MicroStrategy, Qwest, Tyco and WorldCom began between 1997 and 1999,
years before Bush took office.</TE>
<TE>   It may well be proved, in fact, that such business malfeasance
extended back even further, but that's the point: Without some
dramatic eruption, a president wouldn't know about it--and couldn't
control it.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the economy depends on the noninterference of
politicians. That was the great insight of 18th century French
economists, who saw that kings and queens weren't helping by
meddling.</TE>
<TE>   So they came up with the economic equivalent of sang-froid, which
is laissez faire, or "let people do as they choose." And two
centuries of economic history proves that the cool detachment of the
state--leaving people the space to figure things out for
themselves--is superior to warm-and-fuzzy intervening.</TE>
<TE>   Bush may not know many French words or much economic history. And
he's no heroic figure. But he is correct to think that the economy
grows most when the government does least. That means holding the
line on taxes and spending, as he has tried to do, in spite of the
critics.</TE>
<TE>   So maybe it helps that his style is detached, even aloof, because
it allows him to keep cool when other politicians are hot to trot out
some economic snake oil.</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of cool, if the president holds his next fake forum
in breezy, chi-chi Kennebunkport, and not sweaty, red-necky Waco, the
reporters will like him a bit more.</TE>

<HD>Put a Tight Leash on Spammers ...</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spam has been a part of our lives for years. But lately, the scourge
of unsolicited commercial e-mail, or UCE as it is known among
activists and the organized fed-up, has reached epidemic
proportions--and we, the afflicted, are starting to lose it. Why has
it gotten so much worse, and what can we do about it?</LD>
<LD>   Filtering software isn't working. We still make the daily plod
through the subject column of our e-mail inboxes, holding down the
Control key as we mark the offending reams of junk missives for
deletion. Inevitably a bona fide hotel or flight confirmation doesn't
get through, and a lot of shrapnel does. Such is the peril of
shoveling the schlock that accounts for 85% of what lands in our
inboxes and, what's worse, clogs Internet service providers to the
point of lethargy or even paralysis.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-spam watchdog groups have confirmed what anyone with an
e-mail account knows: The problem has gotten exponentially worse in
the last year, not only because spammers are finding new and ever
more infuriating ways to circumvent software programs designed to
thwart them but because there are simply so many more spammers at
work today than there were a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Why? Conspiracy theorists will tell you that it's Al Qaeda et al
kicking up their latest crypto-weapon against us--cyber-terror. But,
says John Mozena of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial
Email, or CAUCE, there's a more likely explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to do, in part, with the poor state of the economy. Most
people who have legitimate, well-paying jobs don't spam. What's more,
the people who are spamming now usually have a degree of technical
expertise that would suggest they were probably working for tech
companies a year or two ago."</TE>
<TE>   Although some of this spam is legitimate commercial solicitation,
Mozena's group estimates that 80% of spammers are just trying to get
your financial information--credit card or bank account numbers--to
defraud you.</TE>
<TE>   "Postage" is free; the time and energy entailed in mass-mailing an
ad are minimal; and the list of balding, impotent, genitally
challenged, Britney Spears-obsessed, chronically indebted suckers is
potentially endless. It takes only one trusting person to part with
his or her credit card information to make the scam worthwhile. So
what to do, especially since the software that's designed to protect
us is still full of loopholes?</TE>
<TE>   The "spam wars of the past five years," as Mozena calls them, have
driven hordes of otherwise apathetic folk to badger their
congresspeople to do something to staunch the ever-rising flood of
junk swamping their computers. All of us should join in the cacophony
of complaint. As yet, no federal law exists to combat the problem,
though this May the Senate Commerce Committee, by unanimous vote,
sent the so-called "Can Spam Act" to the Senate floor for
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the European Union Parliament managed to pass what spam
busters consider the most effective UCE directive to date. It
stipulates that by the end of 2003, European Union countries must
pass laws prohibiting spammers from sending UCEs to anyone with whom
they do not have a preexisting business relationship.</TE>
<TE>   According to Mozena, a similar law is unlikely to make its way
here any time soon. "The marketing industry lobby in the U.S. is far
too powerful to even get a hearing on [such a] bill over here."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly not without public pressure. For the most part, laws
like those proposed in Europe would work. Some of the most artful
globe-trotting spammers would still slip past, but severe penalties
would snare those most responsible for the current epidemic, making
spamming less and less attractive to opportunistic amateurs in the
U.S., from whom, experts agree, most spam originates.</TE>
<TE>   Relying on software will not deflect the current onslaught. We
must go to the source. If you want a cleaner inbox, there's only one
thing to do: Send a daily spam of your own to your senator, and he or
she is bound to get the message.</TE>

<HD>A Phantom Ethics Code</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the rules of the Los Angeles Unified School District, lobbyists
are required to register and name their clients to prevent potential
conflicts of interest and unfair influence. This is standard
procedure at City Hall and elsewhere in government where big bucks
are supposed to flow based on the best public policy, not on whom you
know. But at LAUSD headquarters, some school board members approving
contracts don't know whom the lobbyists represent. Nobody keeps
track.</LD>
<LD>   The LAUSD needs credibility in the worst way. Yet, the district
put a politically connected lobbying firm on the payroll even as it
was pushing hard for contracts for clients. That allowed Rose &amp;
Kindel broad and unusual access to the district's senior staff.
Though legitimate, it was too cozy. (Eventually, Rose &amp; Kindel gave
up its private clients while keeping the LAUSD contract.)</LD>
<LD>   This is no way to protect public money.</LD>
<TE>   According to L.A. school board member Jose Huizar, a couple of
lobbyists have tried to do the right thing and register, attempting
to officially notify the district that they had contracts to try to
persuade the LAUSD to favor particular clients. Huizar said they got
nowhere, merely being passed from voice mail to voice mail.</TE>
<TE>   One persistent lobbyist even peppered different departments with
letters saying he hoped his attempt to register would somehow get to
the right place.</TE>
<TE>   Any strong ethics policy prevents the appearance of impropriety
and misconduct. One has been on the books since the Los Angeles
school board approved it two years ago, but it's meaningless. So
rarely is it enforced that LAUSD Inspector General Don Mullinax is
expected to tell a school board committee today that most employees
don't even know it exists. Mullinax's report results from a Huizar
motion, approved by the board, calling for the inspector general to
evaluate the ethics policy.</TE>
<TE>   Huizar says he wants to know who influences the million-dollar
contracts he votes on. That information should be public.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of enforcing the ethics code, establishing a registry,
hiring adequate staff to help the district's lone ethics officer and
providing training will be discussed today. Someone undoubtedly will
sing the no-money blues, though $228 million magically appeared last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Schools Supt. Roy Romer needs to find the money so the ethics code
is no longer ignored and a public made wary by years of bad deals and
broken promises can learn to trust the LAUSD.</TE>

<LD>The civilian governments that have ruled Indonesia for three years
removed only a little of the power of the often brutal, often corrupt
military. Generals run private monopoly businesses and pocket cuts
from military contracts.</LD>
<LD>   Last weekend, the nation's highest legislative body took a big
step, recommending that parliament no longer reserve several dozen
seats for the army. If implemented, abolition of the reserved seats
would be at least a symbolic reduction in the role of the nation's
most important institution.</LD>
<LD>   The 700-member People's Consultative Assembly (500
parliamentarians and 200 nonelected members) took additional steps to
bolster democracy in Indonesia by calling for direct presidential
elections and for keeping the world's largest Muslim country a
secular state. Parliament will need to write legislation to enact the
constitutional changes on the army seats and direct elections; if it
does, the new laws will take effect in two years.</LD>
<TE>   The army has been one of the country's pillars since it helped
expel Dutch colonial rulers soon after World War II. Suharto led the
generals who ousted civilian President Sukarno in a 1966 coup;
Suharto's rule ended in 1998, after decades of increasingly corrupt,
repressive governance. An elected civilian government took power the
next year. In an encouraging development last month, a son of Suharto
was sentenced to 15 years in prison for paying two hit men to murder
a Supreme Court justice.</TE>
<TE>   Washington began cutting ties between U.S. and Indonesian military
forces in 1992 because of governmental repression in Indonesia's
colony of East Timor. In 1999, the United States ended all military
links because the army abetted atrocities when the Timorese voted for
independence. However, some links have been restored since Sept. 11
and there will be more, because Indonesia could become a haven for Al
Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said during his visit to
Indonesia this month that Congress would watch carefully to see
whether the Indonesian army punished more soldiers for human rights
violations. A State Department survey this year found the armed
forces still shooting, torturing and beating civilians, while
remaining largely exempt from control by the civilian government of
Megawati Sukarnoputri, Sukarno's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. funds will pay to create and train a police force, including
a counterterrorism unit, that can help track Al Qaeda. Islamic
militants have tried to increase their influence in a number of
Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, though with little
success so far. Indonesia's foreign minister noted this month that
"Indonesian Muslims are very moderate."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. aid can help support a government that fosters Muslim
moderation, but that money should not finance military atrocities
against dissidents in Indonesian territories such as Aceh and Irian
Jaya. Washington should track its money and hold Jakarta accountable.</TE>

<HD>Reasonable Medical Privacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Medical advances and computerization of patient records can add up to
this: a letter from your pharmacy, which is being paid by a
pharmaceutical company to recommend a prescription drug for your
chronic condition. What's next could be this: a letter from your
employer denying insurance coverage to your newborn, who had a
genetic test--required by some states--that uncovered a disorder.</LD>
<LD>   There's some help against this invasion of medical privacy in
rules that the Bush administration unveiled last week. They merely
let patients correct errors in their medical records and require
employers to get employees' permission before seeing their medical
files. But even mild protections are an improvement over the current
anything-goes system.</LD>
<TE>   The rules, which would become binding on most health plans next
April, are based on Clinton administration regulations that Health
and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson "tweaked," as he puts
it, in several ways. Thompson's first change loosens a requirement
that doctors, hospitals, pharmacists and other health-care providers
obtain written consent before disclosing medical information.
Thompson grants reasonable exceptions, for instance, to let a family
member pick up a prescription and to let a primary-care doctor give
an emergency-room physician the information needed to treat an
accident victim. The new rules also would allow medical researchers
to analyze patient information, but only after patient files were
stripped of names, addresses, Social Security numbers and other
"direct identifiers."</TE>
<TE>   At least two of Thompson's "tweaks," however, leave patients
needlessly vulnerable. The first grants an alarmingly fuzzy
group--"health-care operators"--nearly as much access to patient
records as medical researchers. The second lets drug companies,
without a patient's knowledge, pay a pharmacist to recommend that the
patient switch from one drug to another and continue to send product
mailers to a customer for a particular illness.</TE>
<TE>   That could stigmatize patients by revealing their medical
conditions to neighbors or co-workers. In one recent example, a
59-year-old Florida woman with a history of depression brought a
class-action lawsuit against drug maker Eli Lilly and three doctors
after she received in the mail a free one-month sample of the
antidepression medication Prozac and a note congratulating her on
being on her way to "full recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) are
working on legislation to tighten some of Thompson's privacy rules.
They should let most of Thompson's changes stand. But they should
yield no ground on one principle: Barring medical emergencies,
patients should be asked before their health records are disclosed.
Markey, Kennedy and Thompson should be able to find a way to preserve
medical efficiency without declaring open season on health privacy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your Aug. 8 editorial, "Don't Let Salton Stop Deal," accurately
portrays the situation California faces on Colorado River water, but
it should be noted that we have known the deadlines we face for years
and have been unable to come to agreement on the details of how to
resolve the situation. One of the important details is how the
impacts of the proposed water transfer on the Salton Sea will be
addressed. Your suggestion that the Salton Sea shouldn't stop the
transfer is shortsighted.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to the premise of your editorial, fallowing of Imperial
Valley farmland is not inconsistent with preservation of the Salton
Sea. In fact, it may be the only way that water can be transferred
without seriously disrupting inflows to the Salton Sea, because a
portion of the water saved by fallowing could be transferred and
another portion could go to the sea.</LD>
<LD>   I do agree that Imperial Valley farmers should not be forced to
bear the costs of Salton Sea restoration, nor should they bear the
costs of mitigating the potential economic disruption that fallowing
of land could cause. That is the job of the state and federal
governments, as well as the metropolitan areas that benefit from
water transfers.</LD>
<TE>   There is a delicate balance that needs to be in place to conserve
agricultural water for transfer to your swimming pools, yet still
protect the valuable resources of the state's largest lake. It
requires all involved to drop dismissive views of the Salton Sea and
engage in the challenging biological, technical, fiscal and political
dialogue required to sort out what can be done.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Zero Tolerance Lets a Student's Future Hang on a Knife's Edge,"
Aug. 11: When the principal of Taylor Hess' high school [in Hurst,
Texas] determined that Taylor had acted "recklessly" by bringing a
bread knife to school, he neglected to take into consideration that
by definition, "reckless" behavior indicates a knowing disregard of
danger. If Taylor didn't even know the knife was there, how did he
behave "recklessly"?</LD>
<LD>   Seems to me there are two parts to any law: the "spirit" of the
law and the "letter" of the law. When the letter of the law is
adhered to without any regard for the spirit in which it was written,
good people are made to suffer. Justice is depicted as blind to
remind us that we are not to allow ourselves to be swayed by
appearance but are required to use all of our discretionary abilities
as we weigh the issues.</LD>
<LD>   Katie MacMahon</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taylor Hess was expelled for taking a bread knife to his school.
He neither threatened anyone with this alleged weapon nor did he even
know it had fallen into the bed of his pickup from a box of his
grandmother's things. Any reasoning, intelligent human being would
instantly realize that the incident should have been dismissed with
an admonition to be more careful, but the district has a
"zero-tolerance" policy. He would be expelled.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is not whether he is or is not an honor student. The idea
of zero tolerance of anything is particularly odious at an
institution where students are supposed to be learning to think. Zero
tolerance allows intellectual sloth, demands a closed mind, forbids
seeing any event in terms other than black and white, requires
lock-step obedience that stifles thought itself. Eventually, they
found a bit of wiggle room, and the yearlong suspension was reduced
to "time served."</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Gene Buinger and Principal Jim Short worry that the next
student who brings a knife on campus will demand, "If I don't get the
same, it's discrimination." That they can think such a thing proves
they have learned nothing. There should be one, and only one,
acceptable form of zero tolerance: If you have a brain, use it or
lose it.</TE>

<TE>   After reading this article, two points are now crystal clear:
Zero-tolerance policies in the schools protect only the school
administrators and the politicians, not the students. Political
correctness is really political ridiculousness.</TE>

<LD>Re "Hospitals Seek Share of Blood Industry," Aug. 12: I'm healthy and
have been trying to donate my blood for two years. The first year I
was turned down because I'd visited a country in the malaria zone in
the previous 12 months (even though I'd taken antimalaria pills).
Now, because I've made visits to family in England totaling more than
three months over the last 15 years, my blood is not acceptable to
the Red Cross. Why? Because of the "mad cow" disease scare.
Ironically, I haven't eaten beef for 30 years.</LD>

<LD>Re "Angelyne Moves From Billboard to the Ballot," Aug. 10: As a
resident living just south of Melrose Avenue, I have narrowly escaped
the trap of the boundaries of the proposed new Hollywood city.
However, I am stunned that of the 20 or so candidates who have come
out of the woodwork to run for City Council seats, the only one with
any name recognition is Angelyne, the scary sex kitten whose image
has been hovering over the streets of Los Angeles for almost two
decades.</LD>
<LD>   Secession advocates argue that Hollywood is a seedy shadow of its
former self, and Angelyne, the self-proclaimed "image of Hollywood,"
says she wants to see a new Hollywood city that will "rise to [her]
occasion." I wasn't worried about our image at all until I learned of
the grand vision of a woman whose notoriety is based solely on
appearing half-naked on airbrushed billboards.</LD>
<LD>   People hiding behind clown makeup have always frightened me; let's
keep the clowns in the circus and leave the administration of our
city to people with a vision that exceeds the depths of Angelyne's
cleavage.</LD>

<TE>   How dare Jeffrey Daar, president of the Democratic Party of the
San Fernando Valley, claim to speak for all Democrats in the San
Fernando Valley ("Democrats Won't Help Valley City Candidates," Aug.
9)? I have been a Democrat since I have been able to register and
vote, well over 37 years, and as an 18-year resident of the San
Fernando Valley I support secession--and I will support any Democrat
who runs for office in the new city.</TE>
<TE>   It is the American way of life to involve its citizens in
government, whether it be as constituents or as candidates, and Daar
is threatening that way of life with his despotic orders. If this is
what the Democratic Party is nowadays, I have no recourse but to
reregister Republican. At least they are neutral on this issue.</TE>

<LD>The Times would be wise to explain its policy regarding coverage on
the deaths of innocent people around the world. On Aug. 11, on Page
A8, there is a brief note that 75 innocent people, including women
and children, were hacked to death in a turf war involving the deaths
of over 2 million people in the Congo. This war, with its staggering
loss of life, has gone largely unreported in the U.S. media, which
seem more focused on the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   When we turn to Page A19, we see a much larger and more detailed
article on the unfortunate death of one Israeli woman in the West
Bank. While all killing of innocents is terrible and newsworthy, it
does not explain why The Times devotes more attention to the death of
one Israeli woman over the deaths of 75, or 2 million, Africans. A
newspaper with worldwide coverage should display some sense of
proportionality in covering the deaths of innocent humans.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Plan Would Give States Leeway on Clean Water," Aug. 8:
Trusting states to clean up water pollution? Sounds like a nice idea,
but pay close attention to the fine print. Under the Bush
administration's plan, states can claim that they have inadequate
pollution data and remove a polluted waterway from the cleanup list.
Great for the corporations that paid Bush's way into office, not so
great for the public's health when it is eating mercury-ridden fish
and drinking arsenic in the water.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush claims he cares about the safety of the people, but
he will roll back the Clean Water Act, forcing Americans to drink
toxic water. It's time to stand up, America, and put an end to this
hypocrisy.</LD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's July 31 commentary on affordable housing
misled your readers about the Bush administration's ambitious
affordable housing policy and quoted me out of context. From the
beginning, the Bush administration has worked closely with state and
local officials to help them meet their important needs. What we have
learned is that the nature and the degree of affordable housing
problems--as well as the solutions--differ from one community to
another and need to be dealt with on an individual basis.</LD>
<LD>   That's one reason why President Bush proposed a significant
increase in HUD's 2003 budget--including more funds for HOME, a
popular, successful and exceptionally flexible program that focuses
exclusively on housing needs that the community itself determines. He
created a new public-private partnership with a goal of creating 5.5
million more minority homeowners by the end of this decade. He also
made an unprecedented commitment to end chronic homelessness in the
next 10 years and rolled out $2.7 billion in new housing initiatives,
including the American Dream Downpayment Fund, HUD's Section 8
voucher program and a tax credit to encourage the construction of
affordable housing.</LD>
<TE>   Whether it is affordable rental housing or new opportunities for
homeownership, all of us have an important role to play. In the end,
I believe that partnerships between the federal and state governments
and local public-and private-sector leaders will give young families,
schoolteachers, police officers and families moving from welfare to
work a real chance to live the American dream.</TE>

<LD>Re "Debate Over Tying Cuba to Terrorists," Aug. 12: Part of the
argument against normalizing relations with Cuba is that that country
"had a network of terrorist training camps as recently as the 1980s."
Yet in the '80s the U.S. government shared military intelligence with
Saddam Hussein's Iraqi military, which undoubtedly helped in its
weapons-of-mass-destruction attacks (poison gas) on the Iranians. It
is also the era when the U.S. trained the "freedom fighting"
terrorists of Osama bin Laden.</LD>

<HD>Long Beach Rapist May Have Struck in Huntington Beach</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are trying to determine whether the man who assaulted a
75-year-old woman in Huntington Beach on Tuesday night is the
so-called Belmont Shore Rapist suspected in at least 11 assaults in
Long Beach, west Orange County and Seattle since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The attacker entered a house in the 15000 block of Cambay Lane
about 11:30 p.m. and grabbed the woman from behind. The victim, who
had called 911 when she first heard the intruder inside her house,
managed to fight off the man and force him to flee, police said.
Officers arrived within minutes of the call and used dogs to search
the area.</LD>
<LD>   The incident fit the pattern of the Belmont Shore Rapist, who
attacks older women late at night. Police stopped short of saying it
was the same perpetrator, however, cautioning that their
investigation is still in its early stages.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know if he was there to commit a sexual assault or not,"
Huntington Beach Police spokesman Sgt. Gary Meza said. "There's a
little similarity. But other than that he's ... attacked an elderly
woman, we don't know for sure. It's premature at this point to say
that it is him."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach police said they are sharing information with
Huntington Beach police and assisting with the investigation. "We're
not positively sure there's a connection," said Long Beach Police
spokesman Officer David Marander. "But from the onset, it appears
they could possibly be related."</TE>
<TE>   Police have recovered evidence linking the serial rapist to 11
sexual assaults and believe he may have committed four others in Long
Beach or Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The rapist has attacked at least eight Long Beach women, always
entering through an open door or window late at night or early in the
morning. The women range in age from 32 to 77 and most were alone.</TE>
<TE>   In all cases, the victims' faces were covered, preventing them
from getting a description of the attacker. The suspect also covered
his face in many cases, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The string of sexual assaults began in August 1996 with the rape
of a 40-year-old woman in Seattle. The first Long Beach attack
occurred in January 1997, also on a 40-year-old woman. The last
verified assault occurred at 2:30 a.m. June 26 in the Belmont Heights
area of Long Beach, where a 61-year-old woman was attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe the rapist also sexually assaulted a 72-year-old
woman in Los Alamitos on May 11 and assaulted a 68-year-old woman in
the same neighborhood an hour later. The only other confirmed Orange
County attack came in June 2000 in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We're aggressively investigating this case," Marander said. "It's
at the forefront of our investigations."</TE>
<TE>   With fear mounting over the unsolved attacks, police are seeking
the public's help.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking that they secure their homes and notify us of any
suspicious activity," Marander said. "Evidently this person has been
able to blend in for some time. So this might be someone you wouldn't
necessarily think would commit these crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach police ask that anyone with information call
(714) 375-5066. Long Beach police have set up a sexual assault
hotline at (800) 600-1110.</TE>

Commission, saying that his political and prosecutorial experience
would be an asset to the panel.</LD>
<LD>   Garcetti, who lost a reelection bid for district attorney in 2000,
said he looks forward to serving on the panel. As a commissioner, he
would weigh the ethics of any action involving Los Angeles' elected
officials, one of whom is his son.</LD>
<LD>   If confirmed by the council, the elder Garcetti said he would
recuse himself from any matter involving his son, who represents
Hollywood. Similarly, Councilman Eric Garcetti said Tuesday that he
will not vote on his father's confirmation.</LD>

<HD>State Budget Standoff Could Cost Needy College Students</HD>
<DH>Aid: With classes about to resume, more than $212 million
in Cal Grant funds for tuition, books and housing is on hold.
University system plans to extend credit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Thousands of California's neediest college students may become the
next casualties of a partisan standoff over a new state budget.</LD>
<LD>   More than $212 million earmarked for 194,000 low-income students
who receive Cal Grant scholarships has not gone out because lawmakers
have failed to approve a state spending plan, which was due July 1.
Students use the money to pay for tuition, and a subset of
particularly needy students taps the funds for books, housing and
transportation.</LD>
<LD>   University officials said they were taking measures to ensure that
students eligible for aid are able to enroll in their fall classes.</LD>
<TE>   The chancellor of the California State University system, Charles
B. Reed, sent alerts to the presidents of each of the system's 23
campuses Wednesday, instructing them to provide financial credit to
the 115,000 CSU students who receive state aid. That credit would be
used to pay the students' attendance fees for the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Wally Boeck, executive director of the California Student Aid
Commission, said many community college students will probably learn
of the funding delay when they start classes next week. He predicted,
however, that those schools too will do their best to float a line of
credit for students to help with tuition until a budget is approved.</TE>
<TE>   At the Capitol, both Democrats and Republicans seized on news of
the Cal Grant situation and tried to use it to bolster their larger
arguments in the budget debate.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republicans have called for additional spending cuts to
eliminate the need for $4 billion in new taxes and revenue sought by
Democrats and to begin correcting a structural imbalance between
state revenue and expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans pointed to a letter released Wednesday by nonpartisan
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill, who estimated that a Democratic
plan to raise state cigarette taxes to $3 per pack would still leave
California on pace for budget gaps totaling about $45 billion over
the next five years--compared with projected shortfalls of about $51
billion under a previous proposal to raise vehicle license fees.</TE>
<TE>   "If the governor would negotiate we could reach a deal and we
wouldn't have to worry about Cal Grants," Assemblyman John Campbell
(R-Irvine) said. "The longer this goes on, the more situations like
this will arise."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also expressed concern that money for needy college
students is being threatened, and they took issue with Republicans'
portrayal of the state's future fiscal woes.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Budget Committee Chairwoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach)
said the situation with the Cal Grant money is an example of the
negative consequences of "the Republican budget blockade."</TE>
<TE>   In another budget development, the California Supreme Court has
decided to review a lower court ruling that would require state
employees to receive only the federal minimum wage as long as
California lacks a budget. The decision by the state high court means
Controller Kathleen Connell will continue to pay the state's more
than 200,000 employees their regular salaries until the case is
resolved, which could take months or years.</TE>
<TE>   Salaries for the governor, lawmakers, their staffs and other state
elected officials, including Connell herself, will continue to go
unpaid, however, as will bills from vendors who provide goods and
services to the state.</TE>
<TE>   Complications in the state's financial aid process are expected to
heighten in coming weeks. Boeck said he is most concerned about a
subset of needy students who receive so-called access
grants--amounting to $87 million of the total $212 million at
risk--to help cover transportation, housing, food and book expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who are truly at risk," Boeck said. "Schools
generally can't credit those funds."</TE>
<TE>   State officials typically send Cal Grant funds out during the
first week of August to more than 300 schools that participate in the
scholarship program, but with no budget the money is on hold.</TE>
<TE>   Students usually apply for the money around the time classes
begin.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent colleges don't have funds to lend to students,
there are going to be some real barriers to access," said Scott Lay,
director of state budget issues for the Community College League of
California.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Knight, vice president of college services for Glendale
Community College, estimated that the delay could mean $250 less that
students at her school could use toward books, which average about
$75 each. Classes resume there Sept. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Knight warned that it's nearly impossible for students to catch up
on two weeks of reading assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "The state investment [in the Cal Grant program] may be lost if
the student can't pass the class," Knight said. "The whole thing is
nuts. We're not happy campers."</TE>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Every morning at Lake Tahoe I'd drive to a 7-Eleven. I'd go in a
Ford, but usually have two things in common with people arriving in
more fancy cars, like a Navigator SUV or BMW convertible. We'd buy
newspapers. And we did not smoke.</LD>
<LD>   There also was another group of regulars, largely Latino, usually
arriving on foot in old shoes. They'd buy a California lottery ticket
and a pack of cigarettes, lighting up immediately after stepping
outside.</LD>
<TE>   Many waited on the corner, hoping to be picked up as day laborers.
Maybe make $20-$30.</TE>
<TE>   These are the people Democratic politicians are supposed to be
watching over, right? The vulnerable poor, barely able to scratch out
a daily subsistence--escaping into state-hawked jackpot pipe dreams
and nicotine vapors.</TE>
<TE>   Then I return to Sacramento from vacation and find Democrats
gleefully targeting these desperate souls, acting like pickpockets.</TE>
<TE>   Because Gov. Gray Davis and Republicans won't raise income taxes
on the rich--including campaign contributors--and since the GOP
refuses to temporarily increase the vehicle license fee, Democrats
have decided to hit up smokers again. Lots of working stiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol powers want to reach into smokers' pockets for $1.7
billion this fiscal year, claiming that's what is needed to close a
$23.6-billion budget shortfall. The tax hike would remain on the
books permanently.</TE>
<TE>   And it is the little fellow who would pay--not "big tobacco," as
the Democrats try to spin.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City)--himself a smoker,
who vows to quit if his bill passes--is pushing the biggest cigarette
tax increase in any state's history. He'd raise the levy by $2.13 per
pack, pushing it to $3. It's now 87 cents, having been boosted by 50
cents in 1998 when voters approved filmmaker Rob Reiner's Proposition
10 to pay for early childhood development.</TE>
<TE>   A pack of cigarettes would cost about $7 if Wesson's bill passes.
And something close to it seems certain to.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are rationalizing this as do-gooder big brotherism:
They're doing smokers a favor by pricing them out of the market.
Encouraging them to quit. More important, they're discouraging teens
from starting.</TE>
<TE>   There is evidence to support their rationalization.</TE>
<TE>   "Youth are particularly price-sensitive," says Ken August,
spokesman for the state Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, before the 50-cent tax hike, nearly 11% of children ages
12-17 smoked, according to department surveys. That has dropped to
about 6%, based on 2001 data.</TE>
<TE>   Among California adults, there are relatively fewer quitters. In
1998, 18.4% smoked. That slipped to 17.3% last year.</TE>
<TE>   The state Board of Equalization simultaneously has documented a
significant increase in cigarette smuggling. It is costing the state
up to $260 million annually and is expected to get much worse with
Wesson's tax hike.</TE>
<TE>   Which adults smoke?</TE>
<TE>   The largest numbers are among men, young people, African
Americans, high school-educated and those earning under $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Who smokes the least?</TE>
<TE>   Women, seniors, Asians, college-educated, people making over
$75,000.</TE>
<TE>   Higher taxes aren't the only cause of reduced cigarette demand.
Also credit California's revolutionary smoking bans in restaurants,
bars, shops and at the office.</TE>
<TE>   Clever anti-smoking TV ads likewise have prodded viewers off
cigarettes. They're sponsored by the health services department,
using tobacco taxes imposed by voters in 1988 with Proposition 99.</TE>
<TE>   But the department faces a deep cut in anti-tobacco funding. Last
year, it spent about $135 million. In the current budget proposal,
that's reduced to $88 million.</TE>
<TE>   And this brings up a problem--a disconnect, a hypocrisy--with
Wesson's tax hike. While professing to discourage smoking, Democrats
aren't earmarking any of the new money for anti-tobacco programs. Or,
for that matter, tobacco-related health care. Or to enforce the ban
on sales to kids. Or to douse forest fires ignited by flipped butts.</TE>
<TE>   No, this is all about bullies avoiding the powerful and mugging
the weak. Political cowardice that is politically correct.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have a poll--sponsored by the California Teachers
Assn.--that shows voters cheering them on. Specifically: 68% support
higher tobacco taxes, 75% prefer a cigarette tax hike to higher car
fees, and hardly anyone wants to cut spending for schools, police or
health.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the most important finding: By 3 to 1, people say
they'd support an Assembly candidate who voted to raise cigarette
taxes over one who refused to.</TE>
<TE>   Guess that makes it OK to belt the little guy. Call it collateral
damage in the Capitol budget wars.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats should feel at least a twinge of shame for backing
away from the big fellas in the BMWs and Navigators.</TE>

<HD>Cruelty Charged in Crating of 86 Dogs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Burbank woman was charged this week with animal cruelty for keeping
86 dogs stacked in crates so small they could neither stand nor lie
down, in a house in which temperatures reached 100, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The dogs, most of them pit bulls, were found July 26 in Pam
Miller's house at 120 W. Linden Ave., police said. When officers
entered the home, they reeled from the stench and heat, said Claudia
Madrid, acting superintendent of the Burbank Animal Shelter. Fans
meant to cool the house were too dirty to move air, she said. The
dogs had no water, and at least one had cut itself badly trying to
escape from a plastic crate.</LD>
<LD>   "You never know what's behind somebody's front door," said Burbank
Police Sgt. Bill Taylor. "Every once in a while, the Police or Fire
Department gets to open one of those doors and are surprised at what
they see. This was a big surprise."</LD>
<TE>   Madrid said she was "surprised the dogs didn't go insane. Instead,
when we opened their crates, we had our faces and elbows washed, we
were licked so much."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the home, including a garage, was occupied by dogs in
crates stacked three high in some places, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 51, was arrested Tuesday and charged with seven counts of
cruelty to animals. She was released after posting $80,000 bail,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Her arraignment in Burbank Superior Court is set for Aug. 29,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities described Miller as a once-reputable dog rescuer who
became a dog collector. She left Burbank with about 100 dogs in 1999
the night before officers were to serve a warrant to remove the
animals, said Police Capt. Gordon Bowers.</TE>
<TE>   About three weeks ago, she left Riverside County with her dogs
after authorities took her to court because of conditions in which
she kept her dogs, Bowers said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors told Burbank police that the dogs were back in Miller's
home.</TE>
<TE>   "This happens to an awful lot of people," said Madrid, who
described Miller as a former friend. "They start running a very good
rescue operation and then ... they think no one can take care of
their dogs like they can. They think, 'I love them. I can't let them
go. No one will be as loving to them as I will.' "</TE>
<TE>   About three years ago, Miller placed a sign outside her home
advertising dogs for $15,000 apiece, Madrid said.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew she wasn't trying to place the dogs anymore. She wanted
to keep them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The collecting of inordinate numbers of animals "crosses all
socioeconomic levels," said Ricky Whitman, public relations director
of the Pasadena Humane Society. "There's the case in Colorado of the
elected official's wife who turned out to be a collector. They had a
ranch. Then there's the people in the van packed with cats."</TE>
<TE>   Whitman said the organization had extensive dealings with Miller
until 1997, when Burbank authorities revoked her kennel license.
Until then Miller, as a dog rescuer, mostly took pit bulls from the
Pasadena shelter.</TE>

<HD>Blast Blamed on Gas Buildup</HD>
<DH>Accident: But officials remain unsure why the Torrance
house's fumigation tent filled with the fuel. Explosion leveled the
dwelling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A buildup of natural gas caused the explosion that leveled a Torrance
home, damaged scores of others and rained glass, stucco and other
debris over a two-block area, investigators said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A Southern California Gas Co. official said investigators found a
crack in the pipe that fed natural gas into the home--which had been
tented for termite fumigation--but they had not yet determined how or
when the damage occurred, and they were still trying to figure out
what caused gas to build up in the fumigation tent.</LD>
<LD>   The home's residents were away when it blew up at 5:45 a.m.
Tuesday, slightly injuring 10 people, damaging neighboring homes and
shattering windows as far as three blocks away. It appeared that the
fumigation company had turned off the gas to the house, a standard
procedure, utility officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Initially, fire officials said at least 80 homes suffered various
degrees of damage; they later revised that number to 33 in Torrance
and about 80 in adjacent Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Building inspectors deemed one house in Torrance unsafe for
occupation and gave residents only limited access to nine others.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have not determined the dollar amount of the losses.</TE>
<TE>   As cleanup continued Wednesday at the site in the 20900 block of
Tom Lee Avenue, city officials were arranging a meeting for affected
residents to help with insurance and other problems. It will be held
at 4 p.m. Friday at West High School.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, a state Department of Consumer Affairs
official said Wednesday that the fumigator had nearly lost his
license in 1996 after the department's Structural Pest Control Board
cited him for eight health and safety violations.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Poat, now with Anaheim-based Network Fumigation, was ordered
to pay a fine, had his license suspended for five days, was required
to take a brush-up course in fumigation practices, and was placed on
three years' probation, according to department spokesman Mike Luery.</TE>
<TE>   Poat has not been cited for serious violations since then,
although his record lists fines on four occasions from agriculture
commissioners in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The fines, ranging
from $50 to $205, were for such things as improper record keeping and
not having a washing facility on a fumigation truck.</TE>
<TE>   The home's owners hired Gardena-based El Redondo Termite Control,
which turned over the job to Network. Subcontracting is a common
practice among fumigators, Luery said. The attorney for the El
Redondo firm Tuesday referred inquiries about the case to Network,
which declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Although investigators had not yet determined who is responsible
for the explosion, Luery encouraged homeowners considering fumigation
to check on contractors' backgrounds and to ask whether and to whom
any work would be subcontracted.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Consumer Affairs posts contractors' records on
its Web site www.dca.ca.gov (the site does not include fines levied
by a county for less serious violations).</TE>

<HD>Group Leaps to Defense of Jumping Frogs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANGELS CAMP, Calif.</DL>
<LD>An animal rights group has declared the famed Calaveras County
Jumping Frog Jubilee and similar contests around the country cruel
and inhumane, saying frogs should not be taken from their native
habitat for human entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Animal Protection Institute, an 80,000-member
animal rights group based in Sacramento, are encouraging other
outraged frog lovers to write letters to the directors of the annual
event in California's gold country that features the acrobatics of
frogs memorialized in Mark Twain's classic 1865 short story, "The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."</LD>
<LD>   Animal rights advocate Larisa Bryski says she remembers jumping
frogs from 1988, when she made a bid for Miss Calaveras County. Now,
she'd prefer that humans stop jostling the amphibians in the hot
summer sun altogether, saying constant handling of the frog's
permeable skin makes it easy for disease and infection to take hold.</LD>
<TE>   Buck King, longtime manager of the Calaveras County Fair, is not
swayed. He said the frogs are treated with respect and are returned
to their shady homes in ponds and streams.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very conscious of how frogs are treated. If any frogs are
mistreated, we deal with the person," King said. "In fact, I've had
to evict people from the fairgrounds permanently."</TE>
<TE>   The county fair and frog jubilee are held in May at the
fairgrounds in Angels Camp, about 55 miles east of Stockton. Between
2,500 and 3,000 frogs are collected each year, King said.</TE>
<TE>   King said the annual contest began in 1928 to celebrate the paving
of the city's streets.</TE>

<HD>Citing Injuries, Coroner Rules Death of O.C. Baby a
Homicide</HD>
<DH>Autopsy: The year-old Anaheim girl, who died in March,
showed bruises, fractures and signs of starvation. Investigators will
resume their probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finding signs of starvation and repeated injury, coroner officials
said Wednesday that the death of a baby girl in Anaheim five months
ago was a homicide.</LD>
<LD>   Paramedics found the body of year-old Samantha Rose Gutierrez on
March 26 at her family's home, which had been visited in the months
before by police, social workers and counselors tipped off to
possible abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Supervising Deputy Coroner Rod Thomas said investigators based
their findings on an autopsy as well as information from police and
witnesses.</LD>
<TE>   The post-mortem concluded that Samantha died of ketoacidosis, an
imbalance of acids or ketones in the blood caused by starvation and
maternal neglect. Medical examiners also found bruises on the child's
scalp, fluid on the brain caused by swelling, and repeated fractures
of the girl's right elbow. The findings confirmed the suspicions of
officials at Eli Home, a private nonprofit child welfare agency in
Anaheim that had contacted police and county social workers about
possible abuse of Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Home, which was tipped off by a housemate of the child's
family, first notified the Social Services Agency in January. The
matter also came to the attention of Anaheim police officials, who
found no evidence of abuse during a visit to the house Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Home counselors said they visited Samantha a few days later
and observed a bruise and a scratch under her eye and other bruises
on her left arm.</TE>
<TE>   They said they placed a second call to the Social Services Agency,
when officials purportedly told them the case was under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We believed that serious abuse was going on. Our suspicions were
absolutely correct," said Lorri Galloway, executive director of Eli
Home.</TE>
<TE>   Homicide investigators have received the coroner's findings and
will resume their investigation, said Anaheim Sgt. Mike Hidalgo. No
arrests have been made, and police would not say if any family
members are suspects. Police said most of the work on the case has
been completed, such as the questioning of witnesses and the parents.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives "want to do some more interviews and then present a
case to the district attorney's office," Hidalgo said.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police made one visit to the girl's home in January to
look into Eli Home's initial concerns. Two officers checked on the
family's four children, Hidalgo said, but found no obvious problems.
The Social Service Agency is reviewing its procedures to determine if
anything should have been done differently. A report could be sent to
the presiding judge of Orange County Juvenile Court within 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Galloway said she and other Eli Home officials have met with
Michael Riley, head of the agency's Children and Family Services
Department. He declined to discuss specifics of the case, citing
confidentiality laws.</TE>
<TE>   But Riley said the social services department has no documentation
confirming that Eli Home contacted the agency a second time in the
months before Samantha's death.</TE>
<TE>   When a child abuse tip is received, the Social Service Agency
assigns it to an emergency response worker who does a risk and safety
assessment. If there is a risk of immediate harm, the agency can move
for protective custody of the child. Otherwise, Riley said, social
workers can offer the family programs and voluntary counseling.</TE>
<TE>   The first indications that Samantha was being abused came from
Dulce Soriano, 27, a housemate of the girl's family. Soriano was
attending an Eli Home parenting class when she appealed to the agency
for help.</TE>
<TE>   After the girl's death, Soriano said she was constantly concerned
about Samantha's welfare and that social workers had appeared at the
house at least twice, including once when the girl had a cast on her
right arm.</TE>
<TE>   Vanessa Delgado, 21, who spent two weeks living in the same duplex
as the Gutierrez family, said she saw Samantha twice--once with a
black eye and the other on the morning paramedics removed her body.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's parents moved out of the Anaheim duplex soon after
their daughter's death. They could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Milton Carrero Galarza and Daniel Yi
contributed to this report.</TE>

women in Hancock Park and Hollywood, the latest on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   That attack occurred at 2:30 p.m. in the Carthay Circle
neighborhood in Hancock Park, about a block north of La Cienega
Boulevard. A man described as 25 to 35, about 6 feet tall, 180 to 200
pounds with olive skin and a receding hairline bound a woman in her
80s with duct tape and assaulted her, LAPD Deputy Chief David Kalish
said.</LD>
<LD>   The man got into the house through an unlocked side door after the
woman wouldn't let him in through the front, Kalish said.</LD>
<TE>   The first attack occurred July 27, when an 87-year-old woman was
sexually assaulted in her home near 3rd and June streets in Hancock
Park, police said. The man also robbed the women, taking money and
jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD detectives are working with other departments to determine
whether there is any connection between the four assaults and others
in Southern California, Kalish said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, a 75-year-old woman was attacked in Huntington
Beach. Police are investigating whether that assault may have been
committed by the so-called Belmont Shore rapist, suspected of at
least a dozen assaults since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a top priority for us," Kalish said. The LAPD is
disseminating information about the assaults through volunteers,
community and religious groups and through mass e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker "has hit several times in the area, and we are
gravely concerned for the safety of women in the community," Kalish
said. The reward money for the man's capture was sponsored by council
members Tom La Bonge and Jack Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call detectives at (818)
756-8309 or (877) LAW-FULL.</TE>

<HD>Diane J. Lipton, 57; Daughter's Disabilities Led to
Advocacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Diane J. Lipton, a California mother whose frustrations over the
public schooling of her severely handicapped child led her to become
a prominent national advocate for the disabled, died Aug. 8 of cancer
at her home in Richmond, Calif. She was 57.</LD>
<LD>   Lipton was a program director for the Disability Rights Education
and Defense Fund, a Berkeley-based national law and policy center
dedicated to protecting and advancing the civil rights of people with
disabilities.</LD>
<LD>   She became a crusader for disabled children more than 20 years ago
when she successfully fought Contra Costa County's Richmond school
district to put her daughter in the same classroom with
non-handicapped students.</LD>
<TE>   Needing more resources to continue the fight on behalf of other
children, she enrolled in night law classes and became a lawyer. She
later played a central role in a groundbreaking 1990 case against the
Sacramento city school system that affirmed the right of a mentally
retarded student to attend regular classes full time.</TE>
<TE>   Her combination of legal training and personal experience made her
a formidable advocate, colleagues said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an icon to the disability movement," said Linda Shepard
of the United Parent Syndicate on Disabilities, a national group. "As
a parent herself, she helped pave the way for so many other parents
to ... get their children with disabilities the services they
needed."</TE>
<TE>   "No one had her breadth of experience," said Arlene Mayerson, a
lawyer for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Lipton was born and raised in New York City. She moved west to
attend UC Berkeley, where she earned a bachelor's degree in English.
After graduating, she taught at Berkeley High School.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter Chloe was born in 1972 with multiple disabilities,
including cerebral palsy, mental retardation and a seizure disorder.
Lipton quit teaching to care for her, eventually returning to school
to earn a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Chloe began attending a special public school for the
orthopedically handicapped when she was 3. In 1979, when she was 7,
the district tried to reduce the occupational therapy services it was
required to provide by law. Lipton enlisted the help of disability
rights lawyers, who found that the district was out of compliance
with special education laws on a variety of fronts.</TE>
<TE>   A child of the 1960s who participated in the youthful protests of
the era, Lipton gradually formed a broader view of the problems in
Richmond as "an infringement of her daughter's own civil rights,"
Julia Landau wrote in a 1990 article on the case.</TE>
<TE>   During the school day, the only glimpse Chloe had of
non-handicapped children was through the chain-link fence separating
her campus from the regular school. The only time of year when the
children were allowed to mingle was on Halloween for the costume
parade.</TE>
<TE>   "Diane would always tell that story," said Mayerson, a friend for
two decades. "To her that symbolized the whole picture of what was
going on there. She thought that meant [school officials] saw them as
freaks because it was only when everyone was allowed to be freaks
that they were together."</TE>
<TE>   Believing it was detrimental to her daughter to have no
interaction with non-disabled peers, Lipton began to pressure
district officials to end the segregation and rallied the support of
other parents. Over the next several years, lawyers for the
Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund successfully blocked the
dispersal of more than $70 million in federal special education funds
to California until the inequities were addressed.</TE>
<TE>   The fight ended with the closing of Richmond's campuses for the
disabled and the integration of the students into mainstream classes.</TE>
<TE>   After her success in Richmond, Lipton enrolled in night classes at
Golden Gate University School of Law in San Francisco. She went on to
serve as one of the lead attorneys who helped win a historic victory
for public school children with disabilities in Holland vs.
Sacramento City Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   The case established the right of Rachel Holland, an elementary
school student with Down's syndrome, to attend a regular public
school.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Rachel graduated from high school, where she sang in the
choir and studied science, reading and other subjects alongside
non-disabled peers.</TE>
<TE>   "I say Diane saved our daughter's life," said Kim Connor, Rachel's
mother. "She would not be who she is today had Diane not broken down
the schoolhouse door for her."</TE>
<TE>   Lipton was diagnosed two years ago with a rare form of lung cancer
not associated with smoking. She continued to work on cases even as
her illness worsened last week.</TE>
<TE>   Three days before she died, she was writing a long memo on her
laptop computer about issues at stake in the Ravenswood school
district in East Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter Chloe is 30 and living on her own, with some outside
assistance, in the Bay Area community of Emeryville. Lipton is also
survived by her husband, Jim Armstrong, and their daughter, Daria.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations may be sent to the Disability Rights Education
and Defense Fund, 2212 6th St., Berkeley, CA 94710, or to East Bay
Innovations, 440 Grand Ave., Suite 425, Oakland, CA 94610.</TE>

<HD>The Bad News Was, His Car Is Gone; the Good News Was, It
Was Only Stolen</HD>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While on vacation, I resolved to become more positive about life, so
today I offer this police log item from the Rancho Santa Margarita
News: "A caller wanted to know if his car had been repossessed. He
was ecstatic to hear it may have been stolen."</LD>
<LD>   Raider nation: The start of pro football season reminded me of my
recent journey back from San Luis Obispo on the 101. I always know
I'm getting close to home the first time I'm cut off by another
driver. This year it happened near Santa Barbara, and the perpetrator
was in a truck displaying a Raiders sticker. I can't recall ever
seeing a sedan displaying a Raiders sticker.</LD>
<LD>   Slow-break basketball: Traffic slammed to such a halt in Santa
Barbara that I could have disembarked from my car several times and
made use of the hoop that Michael Fink spotted on the San Diego
Freeway (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Letters imperfect: A pavement sign with some loopy spelling caught
the eye of Russ Fega of Altadena (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Bourne to be confused: Richard Chase snapped a shot of a theater
marquee in the throes of a true identity crisis (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of dislocation: "I guess those Right Coasters think
everything west of the Mississippi is the same place," writes Andrew
Pannell. He relayed an online article in the New York Times about
Gov. Gray Davis signing a bill on "a clear morning in Los Angeles" at
"one of the city's highest spots, the observatory at Griffith Park."
The accompanying snapshot, however, showed a famous Bay Area bridge
in the background (see photo). (Unless Davis used some of his immense
campaign treasury to drag the bridge down here for the day.)</TE>
<TE>   Passport, please: The "Country of Los Angeles" designation that a
reader saw on a Department of Recreation and Parks form didn't
surprise Toni Williams. She wrote: "When my daughter Vanessa was in
the second grade, she had to write a family history, and she stated
that her mother was from California and her father was from Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   As if commercials aren't annoying enough: Mystery novelist John
Morgan Wilson recounted a strange phenomenon on the Adelphia cable
system in his West Hollywood area: "Some of the commercials on the
Court TV channel mix the audio from one commercial with the video of
another commercial. It makes for some surreal TV, i.e.: audio from a
spot for a golden oldies collection playing over video of a Forest
Lawn commercial ... audio for a weight-loss program heard over a
Lawry's Prime Rib spot showing customers digging into juicy slabs of
beef and a little girl being served a sumptuous chocolate sundae
...."</TE>
<TE>   Well, I wouldn't bother Adelphia about it now. The company is too
busy searching for the billion-plus dollars that was allegedly
pilfered by its fat-cat executives.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Jerry Schwartz of Manhattan Beach was driving through
Carson City when he saw a gambling house's partially burned out sign
that said: C A ---O. A friend commented that the hotel seemed to have
taken the S-I-N out of gambling.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael A. Kotch, 52, an environmental activist who spoke out against
rampant development in the fast-growing Santa Clarita Valley, died
Sunday at his home in Castaic. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Kotch was the co-founder and, from 1993 to 2000, president of the
Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment, or SCOPE,
one of the area's best-known environmental groups.</LD>
<LD>   Under his watch, SCOPE achieved one of its biggest victories in
1993, when it successfully sued Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. in Los
Angeles Superior Court for its failure to adequately fund schools and
libraries to serve a 1,900-home development the firm planned to build
in Santa Clarita.</LD>
<TE>   In the mid-and late 1990s, Kotch also served on the boards of the
Newhall County Water District and the Castaic Lake Water Agency, on
which he argued that plans for new neighborhoods were outstripping
water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Kotch, an Ohio native, was a graduate of MIT. He worked for more
than two decades as an engineer at the information technology company
Unisys, where he designed aerospace communications systems and a
computer system for police cars.</TE>

<LD>A Superior Court judge refused Wednesday to lower the $1-million bail
for cosmetics company heir Andrew Luster, who is accused of drugging
and raping three woman at his seaside home.</LD>
<LD>   Luster, 38, who is free on bail but confined to his Mussel Beach
home, asked Judge Bruce Clark for permission to leave his residence
so he could meet with his attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   Clark denied the request.</LD>
<TE>   Clark said that if Luster wants to change the terms of his bail,
he should take it up with the 2nd District Court of Appeal, which set
his bail in December 2000 after Luster challenged the original
$10-million amount.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, a great-grandson of Max Factor, was arrested two years ago
on suspicion of using a date rape drug known as GHB to sedate women
and then sexually assault them. His trial is scheduled to begin Oct.
28.</TE>

<LD>The father of a Richmond teenager who fatally shot his 12-year-old
friend has been convicted of first-degree murder for not stopping the
murder.</LD>
<LD>   Roman Sunday was convicted Tuesday in Contra Costa County Superior
Court. He was home two years ago when his 13-year-old son Roman and
friend Shelton Eaves lured Blair Moore into the house, tied him up
and beat him. The younger Sunday believed Moore had stolen from him,
according to testimony.</LD>
<LD>   Both boys testified that the elder Sunday drove them to a park
with Blair bound and gagged in the trunk. Moore was then killed by a
shotgun blast fired by Sunday Jr.</LD>

<LD>   The $1.35-million project, stretching from Corbin Avenue to Valley
Circle Boulevard in Woodland Hills, will take the Bureau of Street
Lighting five years to complete, said public works spokesman Robert
Reed.</LD>
<LD>   The 194 new streetlights will have 40-foot poles, 6-foot arms and
400-watt lamps in the traditional "cobra-head" style, he said. They

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican Bill Simon Jr. laid off more than two dozen employees of
his gubernatorial campaign Wednesday in an effort to preserve scarce
financial resources for television ads, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   For more than two months, Democratic incumbent Gray Davis has been
running spots slamming his rival on TV stations across California,
while Simon's campaign has lacked the money to mount more than a
minimal response.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been getting hit pretty hard here," Simon campaign chairman
John Herrington said. "We plan an aggressive media campaign,
beginning as soon as possible."</LD>
<TE>   After Simon won the GOP primary in March, his campaign staff
swelled to more than 100 people, about triple the size of the
governor's. As of June 30, Davis reported $31.6 million in the bank,
while Simon's campaign had $5 million.</TE>

<HD>Monitoring of Coastal Waters Is Questioned</HD>
<DH>Ocean pollution: Rapid fluctuations of bacteria often
result in clean beaches being closed, study finds. But testing
methods are defended as the best available.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pollution levels in coastal waters fluctuate so wildly that current
monitoring efforts are largely futile, according to a study released
Wednesday by a team of Southern California researchers.</LD>
<LD>   Intensive testing of waters off Huntington Beach showed that hot
spots of contamination tended to disappear within 100 minutes. But
because of the lag time in getting water-sample test results, a beach
would be posted as off-limits 24 hours later, long after the
pollutants were gone. Yet the posting couldn't be lifted until
another sample tested clean--which takes another 24 hours because of
the limits of testing methods.</LD>
<LD>   In practical terms, that means beaches across Southern California
and around the nation are regularly being labeled "polluted" and
closed when they are clean, researchers said.</LD>
<TE>   But health experts and environmentalists say that despite its
flaws, current testing procedures are the best tools they have to
protect the public.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the economically devastating closures of
Huntington Beach's shoreline in 1999, scientists from UC Irvine,
Chapman University in Orange and the Orange County Sanitation
District analyzed 43 years of water testing data for the city's
beaches and conducted intensive tests over the past year. They
concluded that despite widespread public perceptions that coastal
waters are becoming increasingly degraded, water quality off
Huntington Beach has actually improved over four decades.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that improvement is tied to the 1972 Clean Water Act and
projects that help keep sewage and urban runoff from hitting the
water--from the sanitation district's construction of a new outfall
in 1971 farther offshore to storm-drain diversions in the late 1990s
that kept bacteria-laden runoff from hitting the beach.</TE>
<TE>   UCI's Stanley Grant, of the eight authors of the study published
Wednesday on the Environmental Science &amp; Technology journal Web site,
said this conclusion raised the next question: If water quality is
improving, why does it appear to be getting worse?</TE>
<TE>   Numerous studies, including a report by the Natural Resources
Defense Council released last month, paint a grim picture. The 12th
annual "Testing the Waters" study showed that beach closures and
warnings due to pollution were up again across the nation and in the
state in 2001. Orange County led the way with 1,592 closures and
advisories in 2001. Grant said the avalanche of new postings and
closures was the result of a state law that took effect three years
ago, requiring health officials to post warnings on beaches if
bacteria levels exceed a specified level in either a single water
sample or in several samples over a month. The law, regarded as the
most stringent in the nation, was intended to notify the public when
the water was unhealthful.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the lengthy analysis time for water samples brings
into question whether the law is doing what was intended.</TE>
<TE>   Using samples collected hourly as well as every 10 minutes,
researchers found that pollution levels fluctuate wildly, and
individual contamination hot spots tend to last less than 100
minutes. A test that shows a beach is dirty may not be valid two
hours later. This "has immediate practical implications for the
monitoring ... of coastal pollution," the study concluded. "Decisions
to post or close a beach should not be based on" a single sample that
exceeds standards.</TE>
<TE>   That conclusion was immediately questioned by environmentalists
and O.C. health officials.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a health and safety issue; we want to err on the side of
caution," said Christopher J. Evans, executive director of the
Surfrider Foundation. "Even though the [monitoring] isn't perfect, it
is the best we have right now."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Honeybourne, chief of the county Health Care Agency's water
quality program, said a majority most of his agency's beach warnings
are posted on the basis of a single dirty sample. He conceded that
could mean clean beaches are being closed. Such situations, while
unfortunate, are necessary, he said. "It's the most protective of
public health."</TE>

<HD>James C. Thomson Jr., 70; Led Nieman Foundation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James C. Thomson Jr., onetime curator of the Nieman Foundation for
Journalism at Harvard University and an Asia expert noted for his
early opposition to U.S. policies in Vietnam and China in the 1960s,
has died. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Thomson, who served as a foreign policy analyst in the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, died Sunday at a hospital in Cambridge,
Mass. According to an announcement on the Nieman Foundation Web site,
the cause of death was cardiac arrest after a brief illness.</LD>
<LD>   In his 12 years as curator of the Nieman program, Thomson made
important contributions in helping open up the admissions policy for
fellows to include women, minorities and foreign journalists.</LD>
<TE>   Until he took over in 1972, there had been only 15 women and 11
blacks in the program's 34-year history. When he left in 1984 there
were 51 women and 25 blacks. Thomson also broadened the program to
include photographers, an editorial cartoonist and members of the
electronic media.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomson also drew criticism during his tenure from some
previous Nieman fellows, who believed that his specialty as a foreign
policy expert made him too distant from the world of professional
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson was born in Princeton, N.J., but spent much of his early
life in Nanking, China, where his father was a chemistry professor
and his mother a missionary.</TE>
<TE>   He attended the University of Nanking in 1948-49 and witnessed the
climax of the civil war that brought the Communist government to
power.</TE>
<TE>   He then enrolled at Yale, where he earned a bachelor's degree and
served as chairman of the Yale Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   He studied at Cambridge University in England, and in 1961 earned
a doctoral degree in modern Chinese history at Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   His influence on political policy began in the mid-1950s, when he
worked for Democrat Adlai Stevenson in his campaign to deny President
Eisenhower a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson would later say that his greatest contribution to the
campaign was his coinage of the word "brinkmanship" to describe the
Eisenhower administration's foreign policy, which Thomson believed
brought the country to the brink of war in its efforts to stop Soviet
expansionism.</TE>
<TE>   While finishing his doctorate, he joined the staff of Rep. Chester
Bowles, who was John F. Kennedy's foreign policy advisor during the
1960 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   With the Kennedy victory, Thomson joined the foreign policy
apparatus, working in the State Department's Far Eastern Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, President Johnson's national security advisor, Mc- George
Bundy, tapped Thomson to guide U.S. policy on the lesser-watched
nations of Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomson was critical of the U.S. military escalation in South
Vietnam and Washington's refusal to recognize the Communist
government in Beijing. He left government service and took a teaching
position at Harvard in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he published a harsh indictment of U.S. policy gone
awry in Southeast Asia in the Atlantic Monthly. The article--titled
"How Could Vietnam Happen?"--won an Overseas Press Club Award for
foreign affairs journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several years, Thomson wrote frequently on foreign
policy issues, mostly for newspaper op-ed pages and for magazines.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, he was named to head the Nieman program, which was
established in 1938 by the widow of Lucius Nieman, the founder of the
Milwaukee Journal.</TE>
<TE>   The program brings writers and editors--very few of whom were
college educated in its early years--to Harvard for a year of study.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Nieman Web site, Thomson told a group of alumni a
year later, "Think of me not as a journalist but a journalizer: one
who has hovered and nibbled at the fringes of journalism for most of
my life. My academic friends think of me as a journalist; my
journalist friends think of me as an academic."</TE>
<TE>   While at Nieman, he enabled the foundation to acquire as its
headquarters the Walter Lippman House, a stately Greek revival home
on the Harvard campus.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving as Nieman curator in 1984, Thomson taught
international relations, history and journalism at Boston University
until his retirement in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, the critic and poet Diana Butler Thomson, who also
taught at Harvard, died in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson is survived by two sisters, Sydney Thomson Brown of Palo
Alto and Nancy Waller of Cherry Valley, N.Y.; two stepchildren, Dr.
Anne Butler of Brookline, Mass., and Lawrence D. Butler of Ashland,
Mass.; and four step-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Jury in Van Dam Case Deliberates 5th Day Without Reaching
Verdict</HD>
<DH>Trial: Judge orders closed-door session today to hear a
request from defendant David Westerfield's attorney. A memorial to
the victim draws visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The jury in the David Westerfield trial Wednesday spent its fifth day
of deliberations without reaching a decision, as the judge ordered a
closed-door session today to hear a request by Westerfield's
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Feldman, Westerfield's lead attorney, has asked repeatedly
for Superior Court Judge William Mudd to sequester jurors to keep
them from being influenced by what Mudd has called a "tsunami" of
media coverage. Westerfield could face the death penalty if convicted
of the kidnap and murder of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   It is unclear whether today's hearing involves another request by
Feldman for Mudd to sequester the jury. Feldman's co-counsel Robert
Boyce, at a hearing Tuesday, decried what he called attempts by the
media to sensationalize the case.</LD>
<TE>   As they ponder the charges against the 50-year-old design
engineer, the jury has asked to see the pornography that was seized
at his home, hear an audio recording of his interview with police,
and view a provocative picture he took of the teenage daughter of a
former girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, visitors to a makeshift memorial to Danielle continue
to bring teddy bears, poems, religious materials, balloons, flowers
and other items to the site in rural Dehesa where her body was found
Feb. 27, 25 days after she disappeared from her parents' home in the
upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   One handwritten sign reads: "We Will Never Forget You. We Hope You
Find Justice." Another says: "Danielle: We Love You Angel. The Garcia
Family."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Westerfield dumped Danielle's body in
Dehesa during a circuitous trip he made in his recreational vehicle
from the beach to the desert and back again the weekend that she
disappeared. Fibers that matched those found in his home and
recreational vehicle were found near the body.</TE>
<TE>   The six-man, six-woman jury received the case Thursday afternoon.
Before recessing Wednesday afternoon, they had deliberated for more
than 20 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Along with murder and kidnapping, Westerfield is charged with
misdemeanor possession of child pornography. Prosecutors assert that
the child pornography shows that he harbored sexual fantasies about
young girls.</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan Task to Take Years</HD>
<DH>Military: U.S. official rules out an early exit for
American troops, saying snuffing out Al Qaeda and rebuilding the
nation are not easy jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Dismissing any possibility of an early exit by American troops, a top
U.S. official said Wednesday that the military presence in
Afghanistan will last "not weeks or months but years."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said several
years will be required to complete the job of snuffing out the Al
Qaeda terror apparatus and training the new Afghan national army so
that the war-torn nation "stands on its own two feet."</LD>
<LD>   "We made a mistake in the 1990s by disengaging," he said, a
reference to Washington's neglect of Afghanistan once the local
resistance, aided covertly by the United States, had forced the
Soviet Union to abandon its occupation of the country. "If we were
doing then what we are doing now, things would be different."</LD>
<TE>   Although the Bush administration has not tried to hide the fact
that getting rid of Al Qaeda remnants in Afghanistan will take time,
the official's blunt admission that troops will be here for at least
a couple of years more was one of the clearest expressions yet of the
time frame involved.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has not publicly mentioned any timetable for
withdrawal, but it has become increasingly clear that U.S. troops'
peacekeeping and training missions will keep them here for a
prolonged period.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military officials said Wednesday that Special Forces troops
plan to remain in Kabul, the Afghan capital, at least 18 more months,
training the nascent Afghan army and building the network of roads,
schools, bridges, communications and other infrastructure the nation
needs to get by on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "Without building that up, it's going to be hard for us to leave
it to the Afghans," said Gunnery Sgt. Charles Portman, a spokesman
for the Central Command in Tampa, Fla. "I don't think anyone is
talking about many years into the future, but ... there's a lot of
work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the Afghan public would support a prolonged stay by
U.S. and other foreign soldiers, the American official in Afghanistan
said it was his sense that President Hamid Karzai would prefer that
the Western presence "broaden in mission and mandate."</TE>
<TE>   A Karzai spokesman was not available for comment late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But some observers have said U.S. troops might overstay their
welcome with an open-ended campaign. American forces make up about
8,000 of the 17,000 foreign troops here.</TE>
<TE>   With Karzai seated at his side Tuesday at the presidential palace
in Kabul, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami criticized the U.S.
military campaign here and said that the only justifiable reason for
foreign presence in Afghanistan is for reconstruction and that
continued violence would only breed more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. official said a top priority of the Afghan government is
that reconstruction of the country's basic infrastructure should
start immediately to make a peace dividend visible. He called on
foreign governments to make good on their pledges of aid.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $1.8 billion in 2002 aid promised at the Tokyo summit on
Afghanistan in January, only $660 million has been delivered thus
far.</TE>
<TE>   The official said that interdepartmental rivalries and the lack of
a clear rule of law have "held hostage hundreds of foreign and
domestic investments."</TE>
<TE>   A plan to integrate the various Afghan militias ruled by local
warlords into the national army is being prepared and will soon be
presented to a government commission, the official said. The
existence of such militias has weakened the central government and
posed a security threat.</TE>
<TE>   "If Afghanistan becomes stable--institutions become strong enough
that the threat of Al Qaeda and Taliban returning is gone--then we
will not need to be here," the official said.</TE>

<HD>Merger Outline Calls for Belarus to Be Swallowed Up by
Russia</HD>
<DH>Europe: But hours after announcing the plan with Putin,
Belarus' leader rejects it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>For the first time since Russia and Belarus signed a "union" treaty
six years ago, the presidents of the two countries outlined a merger
scenario Wednesday that would in effect allow Russia to absorb the
smaller country.</LD>
<LD>   However, hours later the Belarussian leader appeared to back away
from the proposal, leaving its future in confusion.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan described by Russian President Vladimir V. Putin,
Belarus' six provinces would become members of the Russian
Federation--which already has 89 regions and provinces. Belarus would
in effect cease to exist.</LD>
<TE>   The idea, Putin said, was to create "a single state in the full
meaning of the word."</TE>
<TE>   Belarussian President Alexander G. Lukashenko, a Soviet-style
dictator whose political and human rights abuses have made him a
pariah in the West, sat next to Putin as the Russian leader spoke.
Although Lukashenko did not openly express support for Putin's plan,
his presence and defense of Russian-Belarussian friendship seemed to
imply some form of assent.</TE>
<TE>   "Attempts have been made to create an atmosphere of
misunderstanding and mistrust," Lukashenko said. "But it is
absolutely impossible to turn us against each other."</TE>
<TE>   However, once he returned to the Belarussian capital of Minsk late
Wednesday, he described the plan as "unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   "We will never agree to this," Lukashenko said, according to
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency. "I have already said several times
that the union cannot be built on the principles that destroy the
sovereignty of Belarus and Russia. It must be built on the principles
of equality."</TE>
<TE>   Putin's proposal puts Lukashenko in a tough spot, forcing him to
either accept a union with Russia that could remove him from power,
or reject ties with Russia, which have helped boost his popularity
and keep his anachronistic economy afloat.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia is imposing humiliating conditions on Belarus and thus
preparing to bury our very statehood," Stanislav Shushkevich, who
served as the first president of independent Belarus and is now an
opposition politician, said in a telephone interview from his home in
Minsk. "The time of hugs and kisses is over for Lukashenko. He got
what he asked for."</TE>
<TE>   Forcing the issue, Putin laid out a timetable--referendums in both
countries in March 2003 and elections for a president in 2004. Russia
already has scheduled its elections for 2004, and most Russians
assume Putin will win easily.</TE>
<TE>   Putin also said the unified country would use the Russian ruble
and Russian Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Lukashenko has pressed for the union for years. The idea is
popular with his compatriots, whose lives have been impoverished by
independence and who tend to be nostalgic for the Soviet Union. The
existing union, though ill-defined, has already brought Lukashenko
economic benefits in the form of reduced prices for oil and gas.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts in both countries described Putin's move as calling
Lukashenko's bluff.</TE>
<TE>   "Lukashenko used this game to get more popular support inside the
country and to continue getting cheap fuel and energy from Russia,"
said Alexander Dobrovolsky, deputy chairman of the opposition United
Civic Party of Belarus. "This ultimatum puts both the sovereignty of
Belarus and the political future of Lukashenko himself on the line."</TE>
<TE>   Former Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin announced plans for a
Russia-Belarus union during his reelection campaign in 1996, when he
faced a severe challenge by Communists who favored a return to Soviet
ways. Yeltsin signed the union treaty, apparently as a countermove to
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's expansion into Belarus'
neighbor, Poland. It said the two countries would integrate their
economies and political systems but retain sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   The question that has confounded the proposed union ever since is
how such a mismatch could work in practice. Belarus' population is
just 6% the size of Russia's. Its economy is hobbled by Soviet-style
price controls long abandoned by Moscow. Any political and economic
union that preserved Belarus' sovereignty, as Yeltsin promised, would
give Belarus out-sized power over Russia's economy, foreign policy
and military.</TE>
<TE>   Putin himself had previously expressed skepticism at the idea of a
union.</TE>
<TE>   "Our partners should make up their minds and decide what they
want," he said in June. "We often hear that something along the lines
of the Soviet Union would be desirable. But if it is to be along the
lines of the Soviet Union, then why write in the draft constitutional
act that the states will be sovereign, have territorial integrity and
the right of veto on all decisions?"</TE>
<TE>   Putin was careful in his remarks to speak of equality, although
not an equality between Russia and Belarus. He stressed that under
his proposal, the citizens of Russia and Belarus would enjoy equal
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what happened today is a positive event for Belarus,"
said Shushkevich, the former president. "It is a moment of truth
which I am sure will help Belarus to cleanse itself of Lukashenko and
his regime and move faster toward Europe."</TE>

<LD>   Armando Castaneda said he wants roomy Ford Crown Victorias, not
the 160 Cavaliers the city ordered. "These patrol cars appear better
designed for housewives, not police, who spend eight hours" a day in
them, he said. "The officers are very ample and very tall and don't
fit comfortably inside."</LD>

<HD>Floods Exact Toll in Europe, Claiming Lives and Threatening
Cultural Icons</HD>
<DH>Disaster: At least 94 people have been killed across
Continent. Art and buildings are at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DRESDEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>Flood waters from the heaviest rain to hit Central Europe in more
than a century swept through Baroque landmarks in cities along the
Danube, Vltava and Elbe rivers Wednesday, adding a cultural toll to a
weeklong disaster that has already caused billions of dollars in
property damage, driven hundreds of thousands from their homes and
killed at least 94 people across the Continent.</LD>
<LD>   Here in Dresden, the latest major city to be hit as the flooding
moves northward, the Elbe River swelled to its highest level since
1890 and continued to spill into the city center. Rescue workers who
had spent the previous day plucking stranded residents from rooftops
spent Wednesday evacuating 4,000 Renaissance paintings to the attic
of the 18th century Zwinger Palace, home to one of Germany's most
valuable art collections. Officials warned that the artworks were
still at risk.</LD>
<LD>   At the opulent Semper Opera, also in the flooded heart of this
Saxony state capital, the valued costume collection suffered severe
damage and water stood waist-high in the lobby and stairwells.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of awe-struck residents flocked to the Elbe's bridges
and elevated promenade with children and cameras in tow, taking
respectful note of Mother Nature's humbling of their surroundings.
They watched as outdoor riverside restaurants drifted away in the
flood waters. An outdoor movie theater erected for a film festival
had become an inaccessible island.</TE>
<TE>   Sirens from fire engines and ambulances wailed and helicopters
buzzed overhead, but the hushed audience flanking the waters watched
with a quiet fascination.</TE>
<TE>   "It breaks my heart to see the city where I was born destroyed by
a force we can't control or estimate," said Katrin Brueck, an office
worker idled by the flooding. She brought her two children, decked
out in rubber boots and umbrellas, to watch as workers sandbagged
landmarks and as the murky brown water advanced on the historic city
center.</TE>
<TE>   Dresden, which was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II
and subjected to Communist neglect for the next half a century, had
been painstakingly restored since Germany's 1990 reunification.</TE>
<TE>   Though the flooding afflicting Prague in the Czech Republic,
Salzburg in Austria and other cities south of here was believed to
have peaked Wednesday, Dresden officials said the Elbe had yet to
crest and could reach greater heights today.</TE>
<TE>   Klaus Jeschke, a Saxony state official, warned of a "grave
prognosis" for the rivers and tributaries that flow into the Elbe.
Dresden's peak could surpass an 1845 record for the city, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Huge swaths of southern and eastern Germany have joined areas of
the Czech Republic, Romania, Russia and Austria that are under states
of emergency and facing billions of dollars in damage.</TE>
<TE>   In the Czech Republic, flood waters from the Vltava River poured
over bridges and promenades in Prague's medieval Old Town on
Wednesday. Firefighters worked to prevent debris from damaging the
historic Charles Bridge, as thousands of residents joined a mounting,
week-old evacuation that by nightfall totaled more than 200,000
people nationwide. It was Prague's biggest displacement since World
War II.</TE>
<TE>   A power outage cut electricity to the Czech capital's famous clock
tower, stopping its hands and the hourly mechanized theatrics that
have charmed millions of visitors. At the Prague Zoo, the waters
drowned a gorilla in its cage and forced keepers to put down an
elephant and a hippopotamus they were unable to rescue. A seal
escaped.</TE>
<TE>   By afternoon, the rain clouds parted over most of the Czech
Republic and Austria. In the Black Sea region of Russia, however,
where the torrential rains began a week ago and killed 59 people
before easing, the torrent was expected to resume today.</TE>
<TE>   Officials warned that more casualties were likely. Yuri Tkachenko,
director of the Krasnodar regional weather forecasting service, said
the Russian flooding was "as if a huge lake was suddenly turned
upside down."</TE>
<TE>   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder broke off campaigning for
reelection and came to Dresden to assess the extent of the disaster.
As he flew over the inundated architectural gems of the city's Old
Town, the Elbe spread its mud-laden mayhem downriver to Dessau, where
it joined with the equally swollen Mulde, then marched toward the
Saxony-Anhalt state capital, Magdeburg.</TE>
<TE>   At least 700 soldiers and volunteers near Bitterfeld, about 45
miles southeast of Magdeburg, raced against the rising waters to
shore up a flood barrier and prevent the Elbe from breaking through
to a chemical industry complex. The site is home to 350 companies,
many with inventories that could poison the river and regional water
table if spilled by flooding.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activists and some scientists have been quick to
blame humankind's mistreatment of nature for the violent rainstorms
lashing the Continent.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a steady and measurable increase in heavy rainfall
over the last 100 years," said Mojib Latif, a climate expert at the
Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, where the Elbe flows
out to the North Sea. He blamed the mounting intensity of the storms
on global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Others warn of more climate catastrophes unless industrialized and
developing countries do more to rein in emissions of carbon dioxide.</TE>
<TE>   "A real change won't come until it hurts," said Hermann Ott of the
Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy in Wuppertal. "People
will correct their behavior only when it costs less to hinder climate
change than it does to pay for its damage."</TE>
<TE>   The toll in Dresden was already estimated at $1 billion, with
reports still pending from the nearby Ore Mountain region.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about damage in the billions" of dollars, Saxony
Gov. Georg Milbradt told journalists after spending the day reviewing
the disaster scene with Schroeder. "There is no way we can bear this
by ourselves. We need the support of the federal government and the
European Union."</TE>
<TE>   The central government made $100 million in cash assistance
available for those in immediate need of food and shelter. An
additional $200 million has been earmarked for credits and insurance
compensation to businesses, farmers and homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the losses can only be hinted at while the waters
continue to rise and fresh rains threaten. Dresden's normally
bustling city center has been closed off in areas that are underwater
or threatened, forcing thousands to stay away from their jobs and
closing shops and services at the height of the summer tourist
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an economic disaster for all of us," said Roland Neumann,
who had to shut his excavation business Monday because clients and
contractors could no longer reach or call his office.</TE>
<TE>   Saxony's school year had resumed this month, but students were
sent home Monday and are unlikely to return before next week. Some
clinics and hospitals in Dresden evacuated 3,600 patients to Leipzig,
60 miles to the northwest. Power and telephone outages plagued the
Elbe River valley.</TE>
<TE>   In the Saxony city of Grimma, where Schroeder visited those made
homeless, cobblestone streets were churned up by the swift waters,
leaving behind a jumble of what looked like giant gravel.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't even put a figure to the losses yet," said Manfred
Goedecke of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Chemnitz, a city
traversed by a handful of overwhelmed tributaries of the Elbe. "We
can only hope to come out of this with a black eye and not a whole
wave of bankruptcies."</TE>
<TE>   Germany's economy was troubled before the flooding, which has
further damaged sectors such as farming that were struggling to cope
with stricter environmental and consumer protections after a rash of
food-safety scandals last year. Agriculture and Consumer Protection
Minister Renate Kuenast warned of "a catastrophic harvest" of grain
this year, since much of the crop has been destroyed by rains and
flooding.</TE>
<TE>   The deeply indebted national rail service, Deutsche Bahn, rerouted
traffic to bypass Dresden en route to Prague, Vienna and other cities
to the south because the main train station in this transport hub was
underwater and its electrical and switching systems damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Bahn spokesman Achim Stauss said he could give neither a
reasonable estimate of the financial burden nor a reliable forecast
of normal service resumption.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces killed a disabled member of the Hamas militant group
Wednesday when they attacked the house in which he was staying with
rockets and flattened it with a bulldozer in the northern West Bank
village of Tubas, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The army said Nasser Jerar, 44, who lost both legs and an arm
while preparing a bomb a year ago, was planning new suicide bombings,
including a "mega-attack" on a multistory building in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   "About an hour ago we received his body," Jerar's brother, Walid,
said Wednesday night in an interview from his home in Burkin, west of
the West Bank city of Jenin. "It was a direct hit by a rocket. Only
his head and a small part of his body were recovered." Hamas vowed to
avenge his death.</LD>
<TE>   A neighbor sent by the army to urge Jerar to surrender was shot
dead. It was unclear by whom.</TE>

<HD>Hussein Son Allegedly Shot in Baghdad</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Opponents of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein shot and wounded his
younger son in an assassination attempt in Baghdad two weeks ago, the
Iraqi National Congress opposition group said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the London-based group said Hussein's 35-year-old
son, Qusai, was shot in the arm as he drove in a convoy through the
elite Mansour district of the Iraqi capital Aug. 1.</LD>
<LD>   "There was an assassination attempt by a group belonging to the
Iraqi patriotic opposition in Baghdad," said the spokesman, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. He did not identify the group.</LD>
<TE>   Another Iraqi National Congress official, Entifad Quanar, of the
group's Washington office, said Qusai Hussein was shot by two men
riding in an Oldsmobile who intercepted his convoy.</TE>
<TE>   He said the assailants escaped but were later caught at a
checkpoint in Baghdad and were killed by Iraqi forces.</TE>
<TE>   There was no independent confirmation of the shooting. U.S.
intelligence officials in Washington were skeptical of the report and
said they had no information to verify the claim.</TE>
<TE>   Qusai Hussein leads the elite Republican Guard. Last year, he was
elected to the ruling Baath party's leadership, boosting his chances
of succeeding his father.</TE>

<HD>Koreas Agree to Reunions, Not Military Talks</HD>
<DH>Asia: They also set up a schedule of cultural and sporting
events. The South hails the gains, but observers say an impasse
remains on key issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North and South Korea agreed Wednesday to another round of
cross-border reunions between separated family members and to a busy
fall schedule of cultural and sporting events. But efforts to set up
a meeting between the two nations' military officials failed.</LD>
<LD>   The results of three-day Cabinet-level talks at a hotel here were
relatively modest, given expectations that the negotiations would
lead to a breakthrough in relations.</LD>
<LD>   South Korean officials had hoped that the North's military would
agree to security talks needed before a railroad can be built to
reconnect the divided peninsula through the demilitarized zone.</LD>
<TE>   But despite last-minute wrangling, North Korean negotiators would
go no further than pledging that they would recommend a meeting
between military officials.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the best we could get under the circumstances," said Kim
Jung Ro, a spokesman for the South's negotiating team. The South
Koreans nevertheless considered this latest round of talks "a
breakthrough in that relations are back on track and we have fixed
the schedules for many special events over the year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The family reunions are to take place over one week during
Chuseok, the Korean Thanksgiving holiday, which begins Sept. 14. As
with the last round of reunions in spring, the site is to be the
North Korean resort of Mt. Kumgang.</TE>
<TE>   Talks under the auspices of the Red Cross also are to take place
next month, in an effort to designate a permanent place for Koreans
wanting to meet relatives who live across the border.</TE>
<TE>   More Talks Scheduled</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a crowded schedule for upcoming events includes
economic cooperation talks later this month and negotiations over
tourism next month. The next round of Cabinet-level meetings is to be
held Oct. 19-22 in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   On the sporting scene, teams from the two nations are to square
off Sept. 7 in a friendly soccer match, their first in more than a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea also has promised to send athletes to participate in
the Asian Games, which are being held Sept. 29-Oct. 14 in the South
Korean city of Pusan. As part of Wednesday's deal, the countries
agreed to an exchange of taekwondo teams.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, a delegation of more than 100 North Koreans
arrived in Seoul to jointly celebrate Korean Liberation Day, a
holiday observed on both sides to mark Aug. 15, 1945, the end of
Japan's 35-year occupation of the peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans--the women dressed in colorful holiday robes and
the men sporting pictures of North Korean founder Kim Il Sung on
their lapels--were treated to a traditional music performance by
South Korean entertainers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the flurry of activity, many Korea watchers believe that
relations remain at an impasse on fundamental issues. It has been
less than two months since a naval clash between the nations left at
least four South Korean sailors dead, and the fact that the North
Korean military is resisting a meeting with its Southern counterpart
shows that distrust remains high.</TE>
<TE>   Observer Sees a Lack</TE>
<TE>   Scott Snyder, Seoul representative for the Asia Foundation, a San
Francisco-based think tank, said none of the measures agreed to
Wednesday "addresses the core issue of reducing tension on the
peninsula."</TE>
<TE>   "Talking is better than not talking," he said. "Meeting is better
than not meeting. But it is no substitute for action."</TE>
<TE>   The reconnecting of the railway links that have remained severed
since the 1950-53 Korean War was one of the most important pledges to
come out of the landmark visit in June 2000 of South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung to Pyongyang. But because the line would run through the
demilitarized zone, said to be the most heavily fortified border in
the world, work cannot be completed without guarantees from both
armies for workers' safety.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, who leaves office early next year, badly wants the railroad
completed during his term. Smooth relations with North Korea in the
coming months also are widely seen as essential if his party's
candidate is to prevail in the Dec. 19 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   This latest round of talks was the seventh Cabinet-level
negotiation since the 2000 summit. Most sessions have produced only
vague pledges that have quickly unraveled. But the stakes were higher
this time around because of the impending election.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, North Korea is in the process of overhauling its
obsolete system of food distribution and pricing, raising speculation
that economic reforms could be parlayed into diplomatic openness.</TE>
<TE>   North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun recently sought out
U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell at an Assn. of Southeast
Asian Nations regional forum in Brunei. The State Department is
mulling whether to send an envoy to Pyongyang and will no doubt look
to these latest talks on the peninsula for clues as to whether North
Korea is ready to move in earnest.</TE>

<HD>Survival, but Not Triumph</HD>
<DH>Leni Riefenstahl, 99, has had 'Five Lives' by her account,
but that of propagandist for Hitler is one she cannot shed, despite
her denials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>POECKING, Germany</DL>
<LD>Little wonder that Leni Riefenstahl finds solace nowadays in the
silent world of deep-sea diving, where neither public reproach nor
pangs of conscience intrude.</LD>
<LD>   On terra firma, the last living confidant of Adolf Hitler cannot
escape accusations that her genius cinematography helped whip Germans
into a nationalistic frenzy in the years before World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Only deep under the sea, from the Maldives to the South Pacific,
can the soon-to-be centenarian pursue her photographic art unhindered
by persistent claims that she knew--or should have known--she was
propagating evil.</LD>
<TE>   But even with the benefit of hindsight on the Holocaust,
Riefenstahl says she regrets her association with Hitler only because
it stunted her filmmaking career and besmirched her reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Although her propaganda masterpiece, "Triumph of the Will,"
propelled Hitler to godlike stature in Germany, she has continued to
insist throughout her extraordinarily long lifetime that her role in
the Third Reich's deadly rampage was purely artistic.</TE>
<TE>   "Altogether I only worked with him for six days, as that is how
long the party congress lasted," Riefenstahl says of the 1934 Nazi
rally at Nuremberg that was the subject of her notorious documentary
film and the scene of Hitler's first ominous fanning of the flames of
racial hatred.</TE>
<TE>   "It's often said of me that I was a friend of the Nazis, but that
cannot be justly maintained. I was neither a member of any political
party nor ever expressly sympathetic," Riefenstahl said in an
interview at her two-story wooden home that is more museum than mere
shelter in this quiet Bavarian village. "I was completely neutral."</TE>
<TE>   Born to a successful Berlin businessman who indulged her desire to
study art, Riefenstahl soared to early success in each of the careers
she pursued, from modern dance to silent movies to directing by the
time she was 30. But the war years were her undoing, from the
collaboration with Hitler to the years of detention and interrogation
by the victorious Allies.</TE>
<TE>   Married only once, and briefly at that, she had no children and
long ago outlived the last of her relatives. While she sees
professional associates involved in publishing her books and
photographs as friends, she mostly escapes fellow Germans' cold
shoulder by delving into editing work to pass days now filled with
pain or dulled by medication.</TE>
<TE>   Destined to take whatever secrets she harbors to her grave, the
erstwhile beauty who turns 100 on Aug. 22 sees her life as unbowed
perseverance through jealousy and injustice.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had an easy life, but that is natural for someone who
was very admired and famous and then falls into a crisis,"
Riefenstahl said. "All this happened to me because I lived in a time
that also gave the world Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   Those who accuse her of collusion with the original axis of evil
have misjudged her, she insisted, but they will never defeat her.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a very positive person. I dispose of negative things as soon
as possible, putting them behind me so I can focus on the positive,"
she said, exuding the mind-over-matter confidence she has embraced
for decades. "The positive gives you strength, whereas the negative
makes you sad, and I have absolutely no desire to feel sadness."</TE>
<TE>   She admits to occasional bouts of depression as age and infirmity
make inroads into her entrenched sense of well-being. "But I always
overcome them. They always go away," she said, resentful nevertheless
of the medication she must take for persistent back and hip pain.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably fit and lucid for her years, tastefully dressed and
with artfully applied makeup, Riefenstahl still clings to the
reflected limelight from her days with Hitler even though she disowns
him. She proudly shows visitors this month's issue of Vogue magazine,
in which an 18-page spread includes images of her working with the
dictator, and the 1938 cover of Time magazine, on which she is
featured as "Hitler's Leni Riefenstahl."</TE>
<TE>   In dozens of yellow loose-leaf binders, she has cataloged every
major review, article and editorial to give her mention since her
1923 debut as a ballet dancer, including acclaim for "Triumph of the
Will," one of cinema's first attempts to project military might
through mass marches and impassioned addresses.</TE>
<TE>   Although Riefenstahl had acquired broad acclaim before World War
II with "Triumph" and the artistically brilliant documentary on the
1936 Olympics, "Olympia," Hollywood filmmakers who dominated the
postwar movie industry shunned her.</TE>
<TE>   "I always admitted that, yes, in the beginning I was fascinated by
Hitler," she asserted in her 1987 autobiography, "A Memoir." "I never
denied that. But I had no idea what Hitler was doing."</TE>
<TE>   "Triumph" portrayed Germany as an inspired and invincible nation
and Hitler as a messianic figure leading adoring citizens to their
rightful place as a world power. It is considered to this day an
unparalleled propaganda masterpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Riefenstahl attracted even broader accolades with "Olympia." Her
innovative camera work and artistic presentation of the human body at
the peak of performance during the Summer Games in Berlin established
her as a trailblazer in sports photography techniques now taken for
granted, such as slow motion, zooming and mobile filming. Riefenstahl
deployed 60 cameramen on roller skates, rail-mounted platforms,
riverboats and hot-air balloons, in towers and pits and atop
flagpoles to present the athletes from unprecedented angles.</TE>
<TE>   The images of physical perfection, often presented with only
cloud-dappled sky as background, were reminiscent of Greek
statuary--a deliberate and artistic embrace of the Games' origin.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the more stunning images from "Olympia" were made into
photographs and sold by the ostracized artist to keep herself
financially afloat during the lean years after Germany's wartime
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Freed from Allied detention or house arrest seven years after the
war ended, Riefenstahl managed to direct one last film begun in
wartime before she was driven from the industry. A skilled career
chameleon, she then spent years photographing the Nuba tribes of
Sudan, living in self-imposed exile among people with no interest in
her past.</TE>
<TE>   Riefenstahl waved off as "rumors and lies" the many contradicting
accounts of her life and association with Hitler's inner circle. She
has no time to read disturbing reports, she said, including a
just-released biography by historian Juergen Trimborn, who presents
compelling new evidence that the filmmaker knew more about early Nazi
atrocities than she has acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   While filming German troops in occupied Poland in 1939, she
witnessed a massacre of Polish Jews, Trimborn contends in
"Riefenstahl: A German Career." He also provides documentation of
accusations she has long denied that she used prisoners from
concentration camps as extras for her film "Lowland," about a gypsy
dancer, played by herself, who is seduced by an evil but powerful
aristocrat--a story that some postwar critics contended was an
allegorical rejection of Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   Another account of Riefenstahl's life that will hardly be to her
liking looms in a biopic being made by actress-director Jodie Foster,
who has been in contact with her subject but has failed to secure her
cooperation. Riefenstahl wants the right to censor scenes that
contrast with her memoirs, in which she says she has revealed all
there is to say about her history--including denial of an oft-rumored
love affair with Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   "My memoirs should be filmed, but that's not what the Americans
want. They want to make a film according to their own notions. They
want to present their own imaginings rather than the truth," she
said, adding that she lacks the strength for legal or media protests
to fight any "untruths."</TE>
<TE>   Although the consummate survivor claims to regret having met
Hitler, she is far from shy about peddling pictures of them together.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, she came out with a glossy coffee-table book
chronicling her "Five Lives." It spans her early years as a dancer,
then as an actress in a series of mountain adventure films, her
directorial zenith in the 1930s, then her turn to still photography
among the Nuba tribes of Sudan and eventually to scuba diving.</TE>
<TE>   As with all of her autobiographical presentations, "Five Lives"
offers images of her work with Hitler with neither commentary nor
expressed chagrin. In a visual version of name-dropping, it also
includes shots of Riefenstahl with famous faces through the century:
Marlene Dietrich, Gina Lollobrigida, Mick Jagger, Andy Warhol,
Siegfried &amp; Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Born Bertha Helene Amalia Riefenstahl, Leni, as she has been known
throughout her lifetime, was the firstborn of a businessman and a
former seamstress. Her brother and only sibling, Heinz, died on the
eastern front of the war ignited by Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   Riefenstahl studied classical ballet and modern dance in the early
1920s but was forced to abandon that career--her favorite, she now
says--after a knee injury. She turned next to acting under the
direction of Arnold Fanck in six man-humbled-by-nature films before
directing one of her own, "The Blue Light," in 1932. She won the gold
medal at that year's Venice film festival, as well as the notice of
Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   Riefenstahl insists that she never wanted to make "Triumph" but
that she couldn't refuse Hitler. Like most Germans of the time, she
acknowledged, she was impressed by his mesmerizing powers over the
masses. Still in her early 30s when she made the two documentaries
that would forever taint her, Riefenstahl has also acknowledged that
she was swept into the Nazi entourage by ambition.</TE>
<TE>   She traveled to Hollywood in 1938 to promote "Olympia" but was
snubbed by movie moguls who saw her as a Third Reich envoy. Only Walt
Disney received her, and her film never found U.S. distribution.</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, Riefenstahl married a German army major, Peter Jacob,
then took refuge at a villa in Kitzbuehl, Austria, to escape Allied
bombing. After the Nazi defeat, she was arrested and briefly
imprisoned by the U.S. 7th Army, returning to Kitzbuehl only to be
detained again when that Alpine resort came under French occupation.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until 1952, five years after her divorce from Jacob,
that she was released without formal charges. Her refusal to admit
culpability in elevating Hitler has always denied her entree into
politically correct circles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Riefenstahl insists that respectability has come back to
her with time. She staged an exhibition of her photographs at a chic
Berlin gallery two years ago, drawing only scattered protests. She
doesn't point out the furor that erupted among Holocaust survivor
groups in 1997, when the Cinecon club of private film buffs spirited
her into Los Angeles to accept an award for lifetime achievement.</TE>
<TE>   And she sees the backlog of interview requests mounting ahead of
her centennial as further evidence of her overdue rehabilitation. Her
daily mail, she said, is voluminous and 100% in her favor.</TE>
<TE>   People, mostly journalists, visit, but her typical day begins with
an hourlong walk alone through the forests around Starnberger Lake
followed by 12 hours in the ground-floor studio that takes up much of
her home.</TE>
<TE>   To mark her milestone birthday, Riefenstahl has produced her first
film in nearly half a century. "Underwater Impressions," though less
than an hour long, presents footage from some of the more than 2,000
dives she's made around the world since taking up the sport at 72.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of a festive premiere accompanied this year's announcement of
the film's emergence. But Riefenstahl now says the work may be
unsuitable for the big screen because it was made as a video and
could lose its vibrant colors if converted. She has yet to secure a
distributor for the video, despite having announced months ago that
it would be available by her birthday.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that cinemas or producers still shun her works or fear
anti-Nazi protests, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have lots of requests, from Berlin, Munich, from all over the
world," she said, adding that it would probably be too physically
demanding for her to face the attendant flurry of interviews and
receptions.</TE>

<HD>Trial of Palestinian Plays to World Jury</HD>
<DH>Israel: Both sides see the Marwan Barghouti case as a
chance to sway the court of public opinion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>If there were any doubts that the mass-murder trial of Marwan
Barghouti is aimed at multiple audiences, the fiery Palestinian
leader dispelled them in no time.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking in Arabic, Hebrew and English, Barghouti on Wednesday
made his first public appearance in four months and defiantly told
prosecutors, and the world, that the Palestinian uprising will live
on.</LD>
<LD>   So began the first trial of a senior Palestinian militant in
nearly two years of raging conflict. As head of Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement in the West Bank, Barghouti acted as the principal field
marshal in months of violent and nonviolent confrontations with the
Israelis. His popularity is second only to that of Arafat, president
of the Palestinian Authority.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers captured Barghouti on April 15 during an invasion
of the West Bank city of Ramallah after a surge in Palestinian
suicide bombings. He claims he has been held in solitary confinement
for nearly 100 days, subjected to intense interrogation while forced
to sit in a cramped position, and deprived of sleep.</TE>
<TE>   In a Tel Aviv courtroom Wednesday, a bearded Barghouti, 43,
appeared to have lost weight but otherwise seemed fit. He repeatedly
raised his handcuffed hands, gesturing triumph, and spouted speeches
rapid-fire until guards twice dragged him away.</TE>
<TE>   "The intifada will win," Barghouti said in Hebrew, calling out to
the gaggle of reporters who crowded into the courtroom and leaped
over benches to get a closer look. In Arabic, he said: "I'll keep
fighting on until I get my freedom. You cannot break the intifada
with occupation."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he felt, Barghouti, dressed in prison browns, said,
"Baruch Hashem, beseder," or "Praise God, I'm OK," using an
expression in Hebrew common among religious Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials presented a thick, detailed indictment against
Barghouti, accusing him of "initiating, planning or financing 37
terrorist attacks" that caused the deaths of dozens of Israelis. He
is charged with murder, attempted murder, incitement to murder and
membership in a terrorist organization, among other counts. The
maximum penalty he could face is life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli prosecutors accuse Barghouti of directing the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, an armed militia affiliated with Fatah that has
killed numerous Israelis in shootings and suicide bombings. Barghouti
has denied the charges and says he is only a politician.</TE>
<TE>   For both Israel and Barghouti, the trial is much more than a legal
proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, buffeted by criticism from the international human rights
community over its treatment of Palestinians, is eager to present
itself as a lawful nation that can provide a just trial even to a man
it regards as a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   Although Palestinians accused of armed actions against Israelis
normally are prosecuted before a military tribunal, in mostly closed
sessions, Barghouti's trial is taking place in a civilian court.
Atty. Gen. Elyakim Rubinstein ordered the change so that the
proceedings could receive full media coverage and international
observance. Also, by trying Barghouti in this venue, Israel can
emphasize that many of his alleged victims were civilians, not
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "He will get the fairest trial that anyone could dream of," said
Israeli Foreign Ministry official Gideon Meir. "This will show that
the Israeli legal system is above politics, and everything will be
judged on the merits. And if he is convicted, Barghouti can appeal to
the Israeli Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a show trial," countered one of Barghouti's attorneys,
Jawad Boulos.</TE>
<TE>   Israel also hopes to use the litany of charges against Barghouti
to further discredit and delegitimize Arafat, painting the entire
Palestinian leadership with the same bloody brush. The government of
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has worked systematically to
decapitate the Palestinian Authority and wants to bolster its case
here.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Barghouti wants to put Israel on trial. Though the
court undoubtedly will limit the scope of what he can place into
evidence, he hopes to shift the spotlight to Israel's 35-year-old
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "We will try to convince the world that the one which has to be
brought to trial is the occupation and those who have committed so
many crimes" against Palestinians, Boulos said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's imprisonment and prosecution of Barghouti could
ultimately backfire by handing him a platform and making him a martyr
for the Palestinian nationalist cause.</TE>
<TE>   Though Israelis don't see it this way, Barghouti is considered a
moderate in the Palestinian milieu. He favors a peace in which Israel
and Palestine live side by side, although in the last two years he
has been increasingly willing to use violence to achieve that goal.</TE>
<TE>   His popularity has risen since his capture. His picture has been
plastered all over cities such as Ramallah, and his wife, Fadwa, just
completed a tour of Arab countries to drum up support.</TE>
<TE>   For some Palestinians, it is required of their leaders that they
spend time in an Israeli prison--where Barghouti said he has been
reading Hebrew-language newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "Israelis are just making a hero out of him. A legend, actually,"
said Nader Said, a sociologist and pollster at Birzeit University in
Ramallah. With Barghouti removed from the Palestinian political
scene, Said argued, more hard-line Islamic militants are supplanting
the secular nationalists that Barghouti led and galvanized.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's court hearing, Barghouti's attorneys also argued
that the Israeli judiciary has no jurisdiction over their client,
that he was "kidnapped" from Palestinian-controlled territory and
that he does not recognize the laws "of the occupier."</TE>
<TE>   Devora Chen, the lead prosecutor, said Israeli jurisdiction
applies because Barghouti's many alleged victims were Israelis and
many were killed in Israel proper. She told Judge Tzvi Gurfinkel that
the prosecution will present testimony from some of Barghouti's top
lieutenants who also have been captured, as well as documents the
army seized in raids on Arafat's headquarters and other Palestinian
Authority locations.</TE>
<TE>   Chen also said Barghouti's confessions will be used against him.
Barghouti and his attorneys have denied that he made any confessions.
"According to our view, he is responsible for all acts of those who
were under him," Chen said.</TE>
<TE>   In the 18-page indictment, Israel alleges that Barghouti was a
"decision-maker" in a network of "terror organizations" headed
ultimately by Arafat. He obtained large sums of money from Arafat and
bought weapons and explosives that were used to kill or wound
hundreds of Israelis, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   As the 20-minute hearing was winding down, Barghouti said he
wanted to bring his own "50-count indictment" against Israel "for the
bloodshed of both peoples."</TE>
<TE>   Gurfinkel told him that his time to speak would come later, but he
also warned that he would not permit the defense to "turn this court
into a political stage."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Authority to Create Holding Company in Overhaul</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The goal is to ensure transparency, official says.
Arafat gains a fourth challenger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Answering U.S. demands for reform, Palestinian Finance Minister Salam
Fayed said today that a holding company will be formed to consolidate
all Palestinian Authority funds and assets under one umbrella.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Fayed said Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat gave formal approval Wednesday night to the creation of a
Palestinian Investment Fund that would be under the finance
minister's direct control.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has demanded that the Palestinians overhaul their
finances, clean up corruption and choose leaders "not compromised by
terror" before he would back the eventual creation of a Palestinian
state.</LD>
<TE>   Fayed, a former senior World Bank official who was named finance
minister in June, said the holding company would ensure transparency
and accountability in Palestinian financial dealings.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is an asset of any kind which is either wholly or
partially owned by or on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, if it
is not in the fund, it will be illegal," he said in East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Fayed said a board of trustees would be appointed in a matter of
days and the holding company would start operations shortly after
that, though he gave no firm date.</TE>
<TE>   Fayed's announcement came a day after a university researcher
announced plans to run against Arafat for the Palestinian leadership
in January elections.</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Nazal, a 41-year-old academic with no political experience,
is the fourth man to announce plans to challenge Arafat. He told
reporters in Gaza City on Wednesday that he would abolish the
Palestinian Authority and declare a republic if he is elected.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for his views on suicide bombings, Nazal said, "If those
young men lived in a free land, they would not break their mothers'
hearts and cause them pain by leaving."</TE>
<TE>   Nazal avoided criticizing Arafat, saying he "is like the father of
all Palestinians." However, he said, "the Palestinian Authority does
not fulfill my people's needs."</TE>
<TE>   Nazal said that if elected, he would dissolve the Palestinian
Legislative Council, create a new parliament and appoint a prime
minister to run internal affairs while the president would oversee
foreign relations.</TE>

<HD>E. Timor's Former Governor Convicted in 1999 Massacre</HD>
<DH>Indonesia: Jose Abilio Soares is sentenced to three years
for allowing militias to kill 100.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The last Indonesian governor of East Timor was convicted Wednesday of
crimes against humanity for allowing government-backed militias to
slaughter more than 100 people in 1999, when the territory was part
of Indonesia.</LD>
<LD>   Former Gov. Jose Abilio Soares, who denied having any part in the
killings, was sentenced to three years in prison, which some human
rights activists criticized as too short. He was the first official
convicted in Indonesia for his role in the destruction of East Timor
after the territory voted overwhelmingly for independence three years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been made a scapegoat," protested Soares, 53, after the
verdict and sentence were read by the five-judge panel. "How could I,
one person, disband a militia that is armed with spears, axes and
guns?"</LD>
<TE>   Human rights activists charged that the trial was a travesty
because the special human rights court was not allowed to examine the
role of the military in organizing and funding the militia gangs that
killed 1,000 people and destroyed thousands of buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "You almost have to come to the conclusion that the Indonesian
government wanted to make sure that no real information would come
out about its role in the violence in 1999," said Sidney Jones,
Indonesia project director of the International Crisis Group, a
Brussels-based think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia reluctantly established the ad hoc human rights court to
prevent the United Nations from creating an international war crimes
tribunal to investigate the East Timor atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors indicted Soares and 17 other officials. Verdicts
against some of the other defendants, including former East Timor
Police Chief Timbul Silaen, are expected as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   No charges were filed against top military leaders accused of
responsibility for the mayhem, including Gen. Wiranto, then
Indonesia's armed forces chief. Nor did prosecutors indict
top-ranking officers and officials named by Indonesia's human rights
commission in January 2000, critics note.</TE>
<TE>   "The conduct of the trials confirms that their purpose was to
deflect international criticism rather than to get at the truth,"
said John Miller of New York-based East Timor Action Network.
"Without an international tribunal, those most responsible for
orchestrating the violence and devastation in 1999 and before will
inevitably remain free."</TE>
<TE>   The verdict comes as the United States moves to end sanctions
against the Indonesian military for its role in the devastation of
East Timor.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration and Congress severed ties with the
military in 1999 and demanded that those who ordered the slaughter be
held responsible. But earlier this month, the Bush administration
announced the resumption of military assistance to Indonesia, citing
the country's importance in the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was seized by Indonesian
troops in 1975 and annexed the following year as Indonesia's 27th
province. East Timorese say as many as 200,000 people were killed
during the subsequent 24 years of occupation.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1998 fall of President Suharto, Indonesia's longtime
military dictator, the government allowed East Timor to vote on
whether to become independent. But the powerful Indonesian military,
which did not want to lose the province, organized militia gangs that
intimidated voters months before the August 1999 election.</TE>
<TE>   After East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence, the
militias ran amok, hacking people to death, destroying 70% of the
province's buildings, raping hundreds of women and driving 260,000
people--nearly a third of the population--across the border into
Indonesian West Timor. Australian-led U.N. troops moved in and
established peace in the territory, which officially became
independent on May 20 this year.</TE>
<TE>   As Indonesia's appointed governor of the province in 1999, Soares
was accused of failing to stop four planned killings that claimed the
lives of more than 100 people, including the massacre of 22 people
who had taken refuge at a church in Suai.</TE>
<TE>   Soares, one of three Timorese among the 18 defendants, denied any
role in the killings and said he attempted to mediate between the two
sides by holding meetings at his house with the rival factions.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, of the International Crisis Group, said the prosecution's
case against Soares was so weak that testimony by many of the
government's witnesses bolstered the defense case. Six of the 18
called to testify against the former governor were fellow defendants
who will be tried on similar charges, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you consider the fact that the prosecution presented almost
no evidence, it's as much a travesty of justice that he was convicted
as if he was acquitted," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other activists criticized the panel for sentencing Soares to
prison for only three years for a crime that could have brought the
death penalty. By Indonesian law, the minimum sentence for crimes
against humanity is 10 years, said Asmara Nababan, secretary general
of the country's National Commission on Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Judge Emmy Murni Mustafa said Soares received a lighter
sentence because of a request for leniency from East Timorese
President Jose Alexandre Gusmao.</TE>
<TE>   The former freedom fighter, who spent seven years in an Indonesian
prison, sent a letter to the court last month saying Soares should
not be "singled out" as the one responsible for the killings.</TE>

<HD>Court Rejects Charges in Anti-Chavez Coup</HD>
<DH>Venezuela: The president's supporters protest the ruling.

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>The Venezuelan Supreme Court dismissed all charges Wednesday against
four military officers accused of leading a coup against President
Hugo Chavez in April.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez supporters angry with the ruling tried to storm the court
following the announcement but were driven back by police and
national guard troops firing tear gas.</LD>
<LD>   State television reported that two national guardsmen and a TV
cameraman were wounded. Citing the threat of violence, the U.S.
Embassy urged Americans in Venezuela to avoid the area and monitor
newscasts.</LD>
<TE>   The court voted 11 to 8 to dismiss the rebellion charges, saying
the attorney general had failed to present enough evidence, said
court President Ivan Rincon, who sided with the minority.</TE>
<TE>   "This is democracy. This is the majority's decision, and it must
be accepted by all citizens," Rincon said. "This country does not
want confrontations."</TE>
<TE>   The judges had already rejected two attempts to put the officers
on trial. Army Gen. Efrain Vasquez, navy Vice Adm. Hector Ramirez
Perez, navy Rear Adm. Daniel Comisso Urdaneta and air force Gen.
Pedro Pereira had been charged with rebellion, which carried a
possible 30-year prison term.</TE>
<TE>   Violent demonstrations have rocked Caracas, the capital, over the
last two weeks as police clashed with Chavez supporters demanding a
trial. Nine people were wounded by gunfire last week during the
protests.</TE>

<HD>Most Firms Certify Books</HD>
<DH>Business: Hundreds of executives meet the deadline to vouch
for company accounting, raising hopes of a return of investor
confidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Executives of most large U.S. companies vouched for their firms'
financial results, meeting a much-anticipated federal deadline
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The declarations by top managers helped to stoke a stock market
rally, as a feared wave of earnings restatements by major companies
didn't materialize.</LD>
<LD>   Executives of a relative few companies said accounting problems
prevented them from certifying their results, but it appeared that
most of those firms already were known to be facing financial probes
by regulators.</LD>
<TE>   As hundreds of companies filed the required documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, the Dow Jones
industrial average jumped 260.92 points, or 3.1%, to 8,743.31.</TE>
<TE>   That raised hopes that investor confidence would be buoyed after a
series of major accounting scandals this year that drove Wall Street
to five-year lows in July.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the unprecedented move by federal regulators to demand the
financial certifications--which chief executives and chief financial
officers were required to sign under oath--failed to erase all doubts
about the veracity of corporate America's books.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC ordered the certifications by the 947 largest U.S.
companies in late June, after telecom giant WorldCom Inc. shocked
Wall Street by reporting $3.9 billion in accounting errors--a
financial scandal that capped months of revelations of accounting
irregularities at such companies as Enron Corp., Global Crossing Ltd.
and Adelphia Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Observers said there was no assurance that accounting problems
wouldn't be revealed by more companies, despite the threat of
criminal charges against executives if their certifications are in
error.</TE>
<TE>   "Does anyone doubt that [WorldCom's Bernard] Ebbers or [Enron's
Jeffrey] Skilling would have signed this statement if it had been in
effect earlier?" said Al Meyerhoff, a partner at Milberg Weiss
Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach, the law firm representing Enron investors in
their class-action lawsuit against the company.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the absence of new financial bombshells Wednes- day
helped trigger a rally on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all waited for months for the next shoe to drop," said
Shelly Meyers, head of Meyers Capital Management in Beverly Hills.
"If nothing else, this gives investors a chance to breathe a sigh of
relief that the worst of this is behind us."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC rule required top managers at 695 U.S. companies to file
their documents by 5:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday. The rest of the companies
on the list face deadlines in the next few months. The dates were
staggered based on companies' fiscal reporting periods.</TE>
<TE>   By late Wednesday, about 475 of the total 947 companies had filed
their certifications, according to the SEC's Web site. It appeared
that many others also had complied but had not yet made it into the
official tally.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said it may not release a complete list of firms that
filed--and name any that did not--until Monday. Companies had until
the deadline Wednesday to request automatic five-day filing
extensions.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the SEC said it wouldn't know until next week whether the
certifications met the exact wording requirements. Executives were
required to sign forms stating that to the "best of [their]
knowledge" their firms' recent financial results did not contain "an
untrue statement of a material fact" and did not omit a material
fact.</TE>
<TE>   The certifications were expected to cover 2001 financial
statements and results of this year's first half.</TE>
<TE>   The certification requirement set off a scramble in corporate
America in late June, as executives were forced to redouble efforts
to check accounting procedures and the accuracy of their finances.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has been worried about having a black mark against
them," said Edward Rhyne, a securities attorney at Gardere Wynne
Sewell in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The process was made even tougher by accounting reform legislation
signed July 30 by President Bush, ordering a second set of
certifications by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires almost all public companies operating on
calendar-year schedules to sign a financial certification. That
created headaches for many smaller firms, which were exempt from the
SEC order but now had only two weeks to comply with the new law.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said companies whose managers who did not file the
certifications could face enforcement actions, though it isn't clear
what penalties the agency might order.</TE>
<TE>   However, most observers agreed that the more immediate consequence
for a company that simply failed to file would be a plunge in its
stock price as nervous investors headed for the exits, fearful that
the firm's books were fraudulent.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting reform law also carries explicit criminal penalties
of as much as $5 million in fines and 20 years in prison for
executives who intentionally file false statements.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce their legal liability if accounting wrongdoing were
exposed in the future, many CEOs required executives under them to
file in-house certifications attesting that their work was accurate.</TE>
<TE>   In part because of the time involved in that process, only about
300 companies had filed certifications by Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The delays raised some fears that many companies were discovering
wrongdoing. But corporate attorneys said executives wanted to show
they were doing everything possible to verify their books.</TE>
<TE>   "People wanted to be sure they did it right," said Paul Gerlach, a
partner at Sidley Austin Brown &amp; Wood in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a surge in filings Wednesday. "They're flying in,"
said John Nester, an SEC spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Given the threat to their stocks, companies that don't meet the
SEC's demands are likely to be hit with lawsuits from shareholders,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There will undoubtedly be a lot of litigation," said Samuel J.
Winer, a securities-law partner at Foley &amp; Lardner in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   As of Wednesday afternoon, however, only a handful of companies
had formally announced that they would not submit certifications.
Many of them previously had disclosed accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   For example, WorldCom, Global Crossing, Qwest Communications
International Inc. and Dynegy Inc. had said they wouldn't file
certifications because they are in the middle of earnings reviews.
WorldCom and Global Crossing are in bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Nicor Inc., a natural gas company, said Wednesday that both it and
the SEC are reviewing its accounting and that its executives
therefore could not certify 2002 results.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies restated earnings before complying with the
deadline, but there was no huge wave of revised reports.</TE>
<TE>   Media giant AOL Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday that its America
Online unit may have misstated revenue by $49 million in the last two
years, but it called the sum insignificant, and the company's
executives said they filed documents with the SEC certifying the
firm's results overall.</TE>
<TE>   Interpublic Group, a New York-based advertising firm, had to delay
its quarterly earnings report to Tuesday after an internal review
found $68.5 million that had not been properly expensed.</TE>
<TE>   The company's executives said they filed certification documents
with the SEC after making the restatement. The firm also said it had
"strengthened certain control processes in order to prevent this
situation from recurring."</TE>
<TE>   Financial company Household International Inc. restated earnings
since 1994, reducing previously reported results, because of changes
in how it accounted for certain costs, the firm said. After the
restatement the company's officers certified its results.</TE>
<TE>   New auditors hired in March encouraged the company to make the
accounting change, Household said. "Different auditors have different
views," Megan Hayden, spokeswoman for Household, said Wednesday. "We
want to err on the side of conservatism."</TE>
<TE>   Household's shares rose slightly despite the restatement news.</TE>
<TE>   At tiny Humboldt Bancorp in Eureka, Calif., officers said the bank
was unable to meet its certification deadline under the accounting
reform law after discovering it would have to restate earnings for
1999-2001. Scrutiny of some employee contracts during the sale of
assets in July led to the decision to restate results, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Humboldt, which has 24 branches, said it would file for an
extension to certify its numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "This certification issue is very serious," said Patrick Rusnak,
chief financial officer of Humboldt. "Anything that is
accounting-related gets painted with the same brush. For us this is
the last thing I would want."</TE>

<HD>Mortgage Activity Shifts to Overdrive</HD>
<DH>Loans: Interest rates for refinancing and buying are at
their lowest since 1966, and consumers are pursuing options with few
upfront costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD and DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home buyers are poised to go on another binge of mortgage borrowing
and refinancing, lenders say, spurred by the lowest interest rates
since 1966, investors' flight from stocks to real estate and credit
so plentiful that one expert says: "If you can breathe, you can get a
mortgage."</LD>
<LD>   Though the boom has contributed to concerns that some housing
markets may be overheating, analysts say it's providing a needed prop
for the U.S. economy. And lenders are swamped with business as
borrowers indulge in "serial refinancing," encouraged by a raft of
new ways to get lower rates with little or no upfront expense.</LD>
<LD>   The Mortgage Bankers Assn., which predicted in March that home
loans would fall 25% this year, expects the current surge to boost
mortgages to about last year's record of nearly $2.3 trillion.</LD>
<TE>   Even including higher-interest "jumbo" mortgages--the loans of
$300,700 and up that are increasingly common in high-priced areas
such as Southern California--the average rate for a fixed-rate
30-year home loan this week was 6.3% and heading lower, said HSH
Associates, a consumer loan data tracker in Butler, N.J.
Adjustable-rate loans are widely available with initial "teaser"
rates below 3%, HSH executives noted.</TE>
<TE>   At Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., borrowers with good credit
and existing 30-year loans at around 7% have been able to refinance
at 6% without paying a dime in closing costs--"nirvana for
homeowners," Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo said.</TE>
<TE>   It's been euphoric for Countrywide as well. The Calabasas lender
is on pace to originate a record $170 billion in loans this year,
"and it's accelerating," said Mozilo, who expects the industry to top
last year's record. But the low rates are only part of the equation,
experts say. Just as important to the boom are the multiplying
alternatives to traditional fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these new products reduce initial payments by charging
only interest at first; others do so by setting a lower fixed rate
for three, five or seven years before converting to adjustable rates.
Others are offered with virtually no down payments required.</TE>
<TE>   At Wells Fargo &amp; Co., consumer demand for a hybrid mortgage that
is fixed for five years and then becomes adjustable has grown more
than 150% from last fall. Brad Blackwell, a senior vice president at
the San Francisco-based bank, said consumers who refinanced their
homes six months ago have been drawn back by rates that have
continued to fall. Borrowers, especially those with jumbo mortgages,
"are flocking to this loan in record numbers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Volume Climbing</TE>
<TE>   Quicken Loans also registered record volume last week, taking in
500 applications that totaled $70 million in one day, including "a
lot of clients who refinanced last spring, last fall," said Jay
Farner, a vice president for the lender in Livonia, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   One consumer who refinanced a 30-year fixed loan to 6.34% six
months ago just refinanced again to a fixed loan at 5.25% that
changes to an adjustable rate after three years, saving him an
additional $120 a month, Farner said.</TE>
<TE>   Lending also has been spurred by the willingness of home-loan
buyers like Fannie Mae and Wells Fargo to accept mortgages
representing more than 100% of the appraised value of a home.</TE>
<TE>   "The credit spigots are as wide open as we've ever seen them," HSH
Vice President Keith Gumbinger said. "You can borrow money in excess
of the value of your home. You don't need a down payment, you don't
need any money for closing costs. Things could change, but for people
with decent credit right now, if you can breathe, you can get a
mortgage."</TE>
<TE>   The surge in applications is starting to strain the mortgage
system. It takes roughly a month for a refinanced loan to get
processed, about double the length of time under typical conditions,
said Ted Grose, principal of First Mortgage Advisors in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Lenders are absolutely swamped right now," said Grose, who also
is president of the California Assn. of Mortgage Brokers. "They just
can't handle all the paperwork."</TE>
<TE>   Fed Provides Spark</TE>
<TE>   The latest spark for low mortgage rates came Tuesday, when the
Federal Reserve Board warned that the danger of the economy slipping
back into recession is greater than the danger of inflation.
Investors dumped stocks on the news and bought bonds despite the fact
that they were paying the lowest interest rates in 41 years. That
pushed rates still lower, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury
note--the benchmark for mortgage rates--falling to 4.08% on Tuesday
before edging up to 4.12% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   With mortgage rates already at the lowest point since 1966, when
the annual cost of borrowing was 6.26%, home-loan company Freddie Mac
was expected to announce today that they have tumbled further.</TE>
<TE>   "That will keep the refi boom going on longer," said Robert Van
Order, chief international economist at Freddie Mac. Long-term rates
could be marked down closer to 6% before the economy gains enough
steam to pull up mortgage rates to about 6.5% by year's end, Van
Order said.</TE>
<TE>   The mortgage spree is accomplishing one of the Fed's goals by
supporting consumer spending, which has propped up the economy to a
surprising extent over the shaky last year and a half. Consumers who
buy new homes also spend heavily to furnish them, while refinancing
can permanently lower mortgage payments or allow homeowners to pull
equity out of their homes to spend on other goods and services.</TE>
<TE>   Farner said many consumers are using new home loans to consolidate
their high-interest credit cards and other debts. Other homeowners,
believing that the economic recovery is too fragile to make major
commitments, are deciding to stay put rather than move into bigger
homes. So they are pulling out equity to finance home improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Rates Help Home Prices</TE>
<TE>   The low-cost mortgages help support housing prices, which in turn
keeps millions of homeowners from feeling overly oppressed by
declines in their stock portfolios, said Doug Duncan, an economist
for the mortgage bankers association.</TE>
<TE>   "[Median-income] households still have far more equity in their
homes than they do in the stock market, and that's helped consumer
confidence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan said the decline in stock prices, coupled with low mortgage
rates, appears to be causing older baby boomers to shift from 30-year
to 15-year home loans as they look ahead to retirement. Freddie Mac
estimates that interest rates on 15-year loans are 0.62 percentage
point lower this month than rates on 30-year loans, a "spread" more
than twice as wide as two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gumbinger of HSH said homeowners looking to invest outside the
stock market even are inquiring about 10-year mortgages, "truly a
rare breed of loan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The low rates have benefited home buyers especially in expensive
markets like California, where the median price of a single-family
home in June was $324,370, up 20% in a year.</TE>
<TE>   But that price picture could change quickly with a major uptick in
mortgage rates.</TE>
<TE>   "If interest rates went up to 9%, prices probably would fall,"
Duncan said. "It wouldn't be a housing-demand problem, just credit
availability."</TE>

<HD>Costs, Terms Can Help Determine Whether to Refinance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>A Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>As mortgage rates head for new lows, here are some tips for deciding
whether to refinance:</LD>
<LD>   * Figure out how much you will save. Typically, consumers save
about $30 a month for each half-percentage-point on a $100,000 loan.
The savings would double on a $200,000 loan--or if the interest rate
fell by a full percentage point instead of half. For a more precise
estimate of potential savings, use a Web-based calculator such as the
one at www.bankrate.com.</LD>
<LD>   * Calculate the upfront costs. Upfront costs such as points
--prepaid interest--title insurance premiums and appraisal fees can
range from 1% to 2% of the loan amount, or even higher (although many
lenders are now offering mortgages with no points). Lenders are
required to provide a good-faith estimate of these costs. If the
actual fees turn out to be significantly greater, you can back out of
the deal.</LD>
<TE>   * Determine  whether the upfront costs cancel the monthly savings.
Divide the refinancing costs by the monthly savings. This tells you
how many months it will take to recoup the upfront costs. If you plan
to live in the home well past the point that the refinancing costs
will be covered by the monthly savings, refinancing can make sense.</TE>
<TE>   * See  whether you can get better loan terms. If you made a low
down payment or had bad credit when you bought your home, you're
probably paying for private mortgage insurance--which protects your
lender, not you. If your credit has improved, or you've paid enough
principal to boost your loan-to-value ratio, refinancing could allow
you to drop the PMI, which could make it a good deal even without a
lower interest rate.</TE>

<HD>Abducted Infant Is Found Unhurt</HD>
<DH>Crime: Child was taken from family van in store parking lot
in Texas. Woman is charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ABILENE, Texas</DL>
<LD>A month-old infant snatched from her family's minivan in a Wal-Mart
parking lot was found unharmed Wednesday more than 100 miles away,
authorities said. A woman was charged with kidnapping.</LD>
<LD>   The recovery of Nancy Crystal Chavez was the "answer to a lot of
prayers," police Sgt. Kim Vickers said.</LD>
<LD>   The infant was reunited Wednesday night with her parents,
Margarita and Salvador Chavez, at the Abilene police station about
125 miles from where the girl was found.</LD>
<TE>   "She was content and beautiful," Sgt. David Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy was found in the West Texas town of Quanah when a sheriff
stopped a car that matched the description provided by Texas' first
statewide Amber Alert, a media-driven warning system used to track
down missing children.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the suspect, Paula Lynn Roach, 24, was being held on a
charge of aggravated kidnapping. Police did not offer a motive.</TE>
<TE>   The baby, Roach and Roach's mother were pulled over in Quanah
after authorities received a tip from a nearby nursing home where
Roach had gone to show off the baby, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at the home, where Roach's mother works, said they
noticed the baby's pierced ears and healed navel and decided the baby
could not be a day old, as Roach had claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Hardeman County Sheriff Randy Akers, who stopped the vehicle, said
he took the baby and asked the women to follow him to the sheriff's
office, where Roach eventually confessed. Roach's mother was not
charged and apparently believed the infant was her granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   James Duke, warden at the Robertson prison unit in Abilene, told
Associated Press that the suspect worked as a corrections officer for
about 20 months before resigning in September 2000. Vickers said
Roach had lived in Abilene for the last several months and worked at
a convenience store.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Margarita Chavez had finished shopping Tuesday
afternoon and had placed her three children--Nancy, a 2-year-old and
a 6-year-old--in the minivan. She stepped about 10 feet away to
return a shopping cart, then saw a woman pulling her infant and car
seat into another car.</TE>
<TE>   The frantic mother desperately tried to stop the getaway car and
was dragged more than 30 feet in the parking lot, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Margarita Chavez was treated for scratches at an Abilene hospital.</TE>
<TE>   A surveillance video captured the getaway car circling the parking
lot in "some type of stalking manner" before the abduction, Vickers
said. The video was distributed to television stations, but it was
too grainy to show the car's license plate number.</TE>
<TE>   The abduction prompted Texas' first statewide Amber Alert, a
system used in more than 40 places nationwide to track missing
children by transmitting information quickly to television and radio
stations.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which was started in the Dallas area, is named for
Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old who was kidnapped and killed in 1996.
Her attacker never was found.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Rick Perry announced the Texas program Monday, and it is
being implemented over the next 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   In Nancy's case, authorities said police departments were notified
and the governor's office sent faxes of news reports about the
abduction to other media. Electronic highway signs were programmed to
show information on the missing child.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CORNWALL, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A bus carrying 35 passengers crashed on the New York State Thruway
early Wednesday, and 24 people, including the driver, were taken to
hospitals, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The Adirondack Trailways bus, traveling from Montreal to New York
City, rolled over on its side off the highway's shoulder in this town
50 miles north of New York City, according to the Thruway Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Police believe the bus went out of control after striking the rear
of a slow-moving tractor-trailer rig, which had only minor damage,
said state police Sgt. James Whittel.</LD>
<TE>   "What we need to determine is whether the tractor-trailer was
traveling too slowly, or was the bus going too fast, or a combination
of the two," Whittel said. No tickets had been issued.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic on the Thruway was backed up for at least five miles.</TE>
<TE>   The injured were taken to several hospitals in the area. Three,
including the bus driver, were reported in serious condition, Whittel
said.</TE>
<TE>   Trailways officials did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>In Midwest, Bush Preaches Economy</HD>
<DH>Politics: President tells crowds in Wisconsin, Iowa the
downturn was in the pipeline before he took office, but nation is
fundamentally sound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>DES MOINES</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday blamed the nation's economic woes on
three factors beyond his control: a recession he inherited, the Sept.
11 attacks and corporate "liars" whose scandals have shaken
confidence in the economy.</LD>
<LD>   As the president began a two-day visit to politically important
Midwestern states and his Treasury secretary traveled to the West
Coast, the Bush administration fired its first shots in a political
season that is growing ever more intense. The goal is to protect
Republicans running in November's congressional and gubernatorial
elections from the challenges created by economic uncertainty.</LD>
<LD>   One day after his carefully scripted economic forum in Waco,
Texas, Bush left his ranch to present himself in Wisconsin and Iowa
as a president aware of the nation's anxieties and confident that the
fundamentals of the economy are sound. He also helped two Republican
gubernatorial candidates, incumbent Scott McCallum in Wisconsin and
challenger Doug Gross in Iowa, raise nearly $2 million.</LD>
<TE>   For Bush, each day this summer seems to put his father's political
fate--and his own desire to avoid it--into sharper focus. After
seeing his popularity soar after the Persian Gulf War, the elder Bush
lost the presidency in 1992 during a period of economic turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the younger Bush equated his efforts on behalf of the
economy with the war on terrorism Wednesday, saying, "We will do
whatever it takes to protect the homeland and ... we will do whatever
it takes to make sure our economy remains strong and vibrant
throughout the United States of America."</TE>
<TE>   And much like his father's efforts to present a picture of concern
and optimism, Bush told visitors to the Iowa State Fair: "We may have
hit a bump in the road. That road is going to smooth out.... I'm
optimistic about the economic security of America."</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill presented a similar message on
the West Coast, telling audiences in Seattle and Portland, Ore., that
there are "bright spots" in the economy that herald better days
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "To a lot of folks out there, it doesn't feel like a recovery yet.
But the economists who study the numbers all say the recovery is
underway," O'Neill told members of the Portland Business Alliance. He
cited low inflation and interest rates, rising productivity and
profits, and a booming housing market as evidence of economic
strength.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said last year's recession was inevitable when Bush got to
Washington, and would have been deeper and longer if not for the
president's $1.35-trillion tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   The states the president is visiting this summer have particular
political significance. In 2000, he lost Iowa to Al Gore by
three-tenths of a percentage point, and he lost Wisconsin by
two-tenths of a point. Since taking office, he has visited each state
seven times. Next week, he will be on the West Coast, with stops in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Shedding his suit jacket under the searing Iowa sun, Bush appeared
before the crowd in a white shirt and red tie.</TE>
<TE>   Soon afterward, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Gore's
running mate in 2000 and a potential Democratic presidential
candidate in 2004, worked the crowd near a display of vintage
tractors.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy's in trouble and this administration has not had an
economic growth strategy," he told reporters. Lieberman said the
economic summit--which he said "sounded less like a summit and more
like a valley"--offered no new suggestions and was, rather, "a stage
for replaying the old ideas--and they haven't worked."</TE>
<TE>   Bush stood before a backdrop of tractors--four red McCormicks and
four green-and-yellow John Deere models--and bales of hay that
created an image of rural prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush also used the tractors as a visual reminder of one of the
more contentious positions he has taken in recent weeks: his signing
last week of legislation giving him authority to make international
trade agreements. It has left some, particularly union activists,
uneasy that lowered trade barriers will send U.S. jobs overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The president said that for every four tractors John Deere builds
in Waterloo, Iowa, one is sold in foreign markets. His point: Lowered
tariffs bring greater sales of U.S.-made goods to distant consumers,
and thus more jobs at home.</TE>
<TE>   He also defended his opposition to a congressional appropriation
of $5.1 billion, of which he said $100 million would be spent on
fighting terrorism and other programs he favors, while $5 billion
would go to projects he said the nation cannot afford.</TE>
<TE>   During both stops--at the state fair here and at a rally in a
University of Wisconsin gymnasium in Milwaukee--Bush sought to put
into perspective the economic challenges the nation is facing, ending
with corporate accounting corruption that has shaken investors'
confidence in the stock markets.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, after all, for the first three quarters when I was the
president, we were in recession. And then, that--Sept.--11 hit. And
that hurt our economy," he said in Milwaukee. "And then, some of
these liars showed up, some of these scandals started to surface.
They've been in the making for a while, but they began to bubble up.
And that shook the confidence of our country."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks came on the day that corporate CEOs and chief
financial officers were required to certify the accuracy of their
financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury secretary also did not comment directly about the SEC
deadline. But he promised that in cases where corporate executives
are found to have knowingly cooked the books, the administration
would "punish these people and put them in jail."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, who received more than $100 million in compensation and
stock option profits as CEO of Alcoa, said he "was amazed to find out
there were CEOs who didn't think about their job the way I thought
about my job," and who abused the trust placed in them by
shareholders and employees.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was at Alcoa," he said, "I thought all of the people who
worked there were like my family."</TE>

<DL>GOLDEN, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters were working to control a wildfire near an upscale
suburban neighborhood Wednesday but lost a single-engine airplane
delivering retardant when it veered off a runway.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities suspected a passing Union Pacific train sparked the
wildfire, which forced the evacuation of approximately 90 homes about
10 miles west of Denver. Residents were allowed to return late
Wednesday evening.</LD>
<LD>   The airplane, carrying fire retardant for the U.S. Forest Service,
was taking off from Jefferson County Airport in Broomfield when it
went about 100 feet off the runway, damaging its landing gear and
wings, said Jefferson County spokesman John Masson. The pilot, Steven
Whary of San Angelo, Texas, was not injured.</LD>
<TE>   The accident came nearly one month after an air tanker crashed
while fighting a wildfire near Rocky Mountain National Park, killing
two.</TE>
<TE>   The Jefferson County fire was 80% contained Wednesday night. Some
residents in the Blue Mountain Estates subdivision hosed down their
decks and lawns as flames from the fire crept within a few yards of
their homes. Fire got so close to one that it burned a hot tub cover.</TE>

<HD>D.C. Mayor Is Fined for Petition Fraud</HD>
<DH>Election: Williams must pay $277,700 for forged signatures
on forms used to qualify for ballot. He's now running a write-in
campaign for a 2nd term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>City election officials ordered Mayor Anthony A. Williams' reelection
campaign on Wednesday to pay $277,700 in fines for submitting
thousands of fraudulent signatures on election petitions.</LD>
<LD>   The violations ranged "from massive forgeries to excessive fraud,"
said Stephen G. Callas, one of three members of the District of
Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics. The panel voted unanimously
to levy the fine.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Williams was barred from the Sept. 10 Democratic
primary ballot for failing to collect the required 2,000 valid
signatures. About 10% of the fine will be suspended if Williams
agrees to have his volunteers and campaign workers trained to avoid
future violations of city election laws.</LD>
<TE>   "The mayor has suffered public embarrassment," said Benjamin F.
Wilson, chairman of the panel that could have hit the mayor with more
than $1 million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   "There were 5,465 obvious forgeries," Wilson said. Names appearing
on the petitions included actor Kelsey Grammer, singer Billy Joel and
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   The names of petition circulators were also forged.</TE>
<TE>   According to the district's registrar of voters, the petitions
included thousands of signatures she characterized as "kitchen table
forgeries."</TE>
<TE>   Those petitions have now been turned over to the U.S. attorney's
office, which is pursuing a criminal investigation of about a half
dozen petition circulators.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this fine is an excessive fine under the
circumstances," said Williams, noting that he has already been
removed from the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he has no plans to appeal the ruling to the D.C.
Superior Court and instead plans to move on with the write-in
campaign that now provides his only chance of winning the Democratic
nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Democratic primary ballot will feature the names of
four virtually unknown candidates, Williams' strongest challenge will
come from the Rev. Willie Wilson, a charismatic minister who is known
for his work with the homeless, drug addicts and ex-convicts.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, whose Union Temple Baptist Church claims more than 8,500
members, is mounting his own write-in campaign, citing what he
describes as Williams' insensitivity to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'd make a horrible preacher, and Rev. Wilson should not
be mayor," Williams said.</TE>

<HD>Texas Executes Killer Despite Mexico Opposition</HD>
<DH>Crime: Javier Suarez Medina's death prompts Mexican
President Fox to cancel a three-day trip to the state in protest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART and RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A Mexican American convicted of murdering a Dallas policeman in 1988
was executed Wednesday in Texas despite clemency appeals by Mexican
President Vicente Fox, who then canceled a three-day trip to the
state in protest.</LD>
<LD>   Javier Suarez Medina, 33, was given an injection and died shortly
after 6 p.m. CDT at the state prison in Huntsville, ending a
cross-border legal drama and creating a new irritant in Mexico's
relations with the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Fox had made personal calls this week to President Bush and Texas
Gov. Rick Perry on behalf of the condemned man, arguing that he was
denied the legal aid guaranteed to foreigners under an international
treaty.</LD>
<TE>   Three hours after Suarez's death, Mexican presidential spokesman
Rodolfo Elizondo announced that Fox would not go ahead with a
scheduled trip Aug. 26 to visit Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and
Austin, or a meeting during those days with Bush at his ranch near
Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision is an unequivocal signal of rejection of the
execution," Elizondo told reporters. "It would be inappropriate, in
these lamentable circumstances, to go ahead with the visit to Texas."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican officials viewed the meeting with Bush as a chance to
revive their country's push for an immigration reform effort in the
United States that would legalize the status of 3.5 million
undocumented Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is a priority for Fox but was pushed off Washington's
agenda after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon raised new concerns about security along the
U.S.-Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Fox's foreign policy advisors and members of his
conservative National Action Party had urged him to go to Texas
despite the execution, rather than sacrifice such an important policy
goal.</TE>
<TE>   News media and ordinary citizens in Mexico, which does not have a
death penalty, followed the appeals for Suarez intensely. "I don't
understand how Americans can say, 'In God we trust,' and then in
God's name kill somebody," said Guillermo Marin Franco, a human
rights activist in Mexico City, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez died after a final statement that lasted several minutes.
He turned to the family of the victim and said, "Forgive me for the
pain I've caused you all. I'm truly sorry."</TE>
<TE>   With his father looking through a window, Suarez spoke to
supporters in Mexico. "Thanks for your support and for never leaving
me alone," he said in Spanish. "Viva Mexico." At that, Suarez's
father raised his fist.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez was sentenced to die for shooting 43-year-old undercover
officer Lawrence Cadena during a narcotics sting at a Dallas
convenience store parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   The former fast-food worker confessed to the murder but said he
did not realize the victim was a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government claimed that Suarez was born in Mexico. It
said he was not told of his right to seek legal help from the Mexican
consulate in Dallas, as guaranteed by the 1963 Vienna Conventions.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas authorities have said Suarez gave conflicting information
about his birthplace, naming Mexico and Texas. Suarez spent most of
his life in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Fox asked Bush to delay the execution while the case
was reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Jimmy Orr said Bush knew about Fox's
subsequent decision to cancel his trip, and he emphasized the two
leaders' strong ties. The two "have an excellent professional
relationship and a strong friendship that reflects the deep bonds
between their two countries," Orr said. Earlier this week, the Texas
Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously refused to commute Suarez's
sentence to life in prison. Suarez lost his final legal battle about
90 minutes before the execution, when the U.S. Supreme Court, without
comment, refused to grant a stay.</TE>

<HD>Gephardt Tries to Put House in Order Before a 2004 Run</HD>
<DH>Politics: As speaker, the Missouri Democrat may receive
spark needed for another presidential bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>After a quarter-century in national politics, it's impossible to
calculate how many times Rep. Richard A. Gephardt has been standing
in a room like this: a crowded, warm, featureless reception hall at
an arts center, where the line for the bar is too long, the lights
are too dim and the ceiling is too low.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Gephardt, the Missouri congressman who leads the House
Democrats, betrays neither boredom nor impatience. In a dark blue
suit, crisp blue shirt and red tie, he stands on a hot summer evening
as solidly as a rock in a river, his handshake firm, his gaze earnest
if distant as he greets the lawyers and the developers who stream
past him at this party for big donors to the Florida Democratic
Party.</LD>
<LD>   "Good to see you," he says to one in a voice incongruously
gravelly for a man with features so delicate. "Thanks for all the
work you are doing," he says to another.</LD>
<TE>   Other than, perhaps, former Vice President Al Gore, no one
considering a campaign for the 2004 Democratic presidential
nomination has shaken as many hands, for as many years, in as many
rooms like this, as Gephardt. Neither has anyone else in the
potential 2004 field campaigned for as many Democratic candidates or
carried water on Capitol Hill for as many of the key party interest
groups, particularly organized labor.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the early media attention in the Democratic race has
focused on the freshest faces among the potential contenders: Sens.
John Edwards of North Carolina and John F. Kerry of Massachusetts.
But if Gephardt runs--and he is actively considering doing so--the
depth and breadth of his connections likely would provide him with
financial and organizational assets that considerably exceed any of
his potential rivals, except Gore.</TE>
<TE>   And that could make Gephardt a much more formidable competitor for
the nomination than it appears today, especially if the Democrats
retake the House this fall and give him a powerful platform as
speaker.</TE>
<TE>   "The only guy who can stop Gore is Dick, if he gets the House,"
insists one senior Democratic strategist close to both men.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, to an unusual degree, Gephardt's strengths are precisely his
weaknesses. His ties to the party's core constituencies are built
largely on conventional liberal positions that could limit his appeal
to moderate and upscale voters, especially in coastal states such as
California. And the same long experience that makes him so familiar
to party insiders may make him look shopworn to average voters.</TE>
<TE>   If Gephardt runs, his greatest hurdle may be to sell himself as a
man with a vision, and not just a resume, to an electorate that has
grown resistant to presidential contenders too long marinated in
Washington, especially on Capitol Hill--as former Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole painfully learned during his 1996 race.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge Gephardt will have in this race will be newness,
freshness," acknowledges one of his top advisors. "The opposition
will try to turn him into Bob Dole."</TE>
<TE>   The miles wear lightly on Gephardt. At 61, with reddish-blond hair
as thin as corn silk, he looks not much different from the young
lawyer who arrived in Washington in 1977, representing a middle-class
white ethnic district in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt served his political apprenticeship as a ward-level foot
soldier in the old St. Louis political machine; he was a precinct
worker and an alderman before he won his congressional seat. In those
trenches he acquired habits that still define him: a bottomless
capacity for work (he was famous for trekking door to door in his
ward), a talent for forging consensus and a knack for climbing past
rivals without making enemies.</TE>
<TE>   With those machine-taught skills, Gephardt rose quickly in the
House. By the early 1980s, many of his colleagues saw him as a future
speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, in 1988, Gephardt ran for president. For such a careful
politician, it was an uncharacteristic roll of the dice: James
Garfield in 1880 was the only sitting member of the House ever
elected president. But Gephardt approached the campaign with a
characteristic belief that enough work could overcome any obstacle.
He assiduously organized the House; more than 80 of his colleagues
endorsed and campaigned for him. And he practically relocated to
Iowa, home of the first caucus, investing more than 100 days in the
state before the vote, and moving his wife, his kids and his nearly
80-year-old mother to Des Moines.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, Gephardt was languishing toward the back of the pack
just a few weeks before the caucus. Then, just after Christmas 1987,
he released an incendiary ad on trade--forever known as the Hyundai
ad--in which he threatened to impose massive tariffs on South Korean
cars if that country didn't lower its barriers to U.S. vehicles. In a
state struggling economically, it was bottled lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the Hyundai ad, Gephardt rocketed to victory in the Iowa
caucus. But his candidacy quickly deflated amid charges of
opportunism and inconsistency.</TE>
<TE>   When Gephardt arrived in Washington, he was a centrist who
frequently broke from the party line. In his first years, he voted
for President Reagan's tax cuts and led a rebellion against President
Carter's hospital cost-containment plan. After Walter F. Mondale's
landslide defeat in 1984, Gephardt was one of the founding members of
the Democratic Leadership Council, formed to tug the party back
toward the center.</TE>
<TE>   But in his 1988 presidential race, Gephardt veered left. While his
hawkish rhetoric on trade was consistent with his congressional
record, Gephardt reversed several conservative positions he had
taken. Instead, he presented himself as a prairie populist,
bellowing, "It's your fight too!" on the stump in Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   After Gephardt's Iowa win, his opponents--led by eventual nominee
Michael S. Dukakis and Gore, then also making his first bid for the
nomination--ferociously accused him of flip-flopping on issues.
Lacking the money to effectively respond, Gephardt was routed in a
series of primaries and soon was forced from the race.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Washington, Gephardt continued his rise in the House
leadership, becoming majority leader when Thomas S. Foley succeeded
Jim Wright as speaker in 1989. (Later, after Foley was defeated and
the Democrats lost their majority in 1995, Gephardt became the
House's top Democrat as minority leader.) But the 1988 race was a
turning point in his career. From that point since, he has been much
more closely allied with the party's liberal wing, and he is a
frequent target of criticism from centrists, including the DLC.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, through the 1990s, Gephardt emerged as a liberal leader
largely through his opposition to some of President Clinton's
priorities. Gephardt led the unsuccessful fight against Clinton's
North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, voted against the
welfare reform legislation Clinton signed into law in 1996 and joined
just one-quarter of House Democrats in opposing the balanced-budget
agreement Clinton negotiated with the congressional GOP in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Later that fall, Gephardt accused the White House of offering
"small ideas that nibble around the edges of big problems" in a
Harvard University speech widely viewed as the kickoff for a
potential challenge from the left to Gore for the 2000 nomination. In
the end, though, Gephardt decided not to run, believing that his odds
of recapturing the House and becoming speaker were greater than his
chances of denying Gore the prize.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as he slogs through the fourth attempt to retake the House
from the GOP, Gephardt is seriously considering a presidential bid
again. He has said that he will not decide whether to run until after
November, but he has also instructed his staff to lay the foundation
for a possible campaign. Some around him believe it is more likely
that he will run if the Democrats fail to recapture the House, but
aides say that even if his party does regain the majority, Gephardt
might renounce the speakership or step down after a few months of
holding it to seek the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   With typical diligence, he is making weekly calls to activists in
the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
He also appears to be trying to mend fences with centrist Democrats.
He has spoken twice to the DLC this year, expressed support for
welfare reform, backed military action in Iraq and tried to reframe
his trade position as a commitment not to closing American markets
but to upholding labor and environmental standards abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the gap is narrowing," says Ed Kilgore, the DLC policy
director. "He seems to have implicitly accepted much of the new
Democratic argument from the 1990s--not all, but much."</TE>
<TE>   That may overstate the convergence.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt recently helped craft a House Democratic proposal that
would have spent at least $800 billion over the next decade to
subsidize prescription drugs for older Americans--far more than
centrist Democrats preferred. While many centrists want to return the
federal ledger to balance as quickly as feasible, Gephardt said in an
interview that he would keep the budget in the red indefinitely to
pay for a prescription drug plan. And in a recent vote, he continued
to oppose providing President Bush expedited "fast-track" authority
to negotiate trade deals.</TE>
<TE>   Given those views, Gephardt's principal assets as a candidate
probably would be his long-standing ties to liberal Democratic
activists and interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   If Gore doesn't run, Gephardt's aides believe that he would
receive the endorsement of the AFL-CIO; if both men run, labor
probably would split, with many of the industrial unions supporting
Gephardt, primarily because they prefer his views on trade to Gore's
free-trade posture.</TE>
<TE>   With union and agricultural support, Gephardt would also probably
start the race as the most formidable competitor in Iowa other than
Gore.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there would be a large coalition around him," says Dick
Neil, the United Auto Workers' legislative director in Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   All that suggests that in a second presidential bid, Gephardt
could stack up institutional support like cordwood. The question is
whether he could find a spark to ignite it.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters believe cresting concern about the economy and
corporate corruption could provide a favorable backdrop for his
long-standing populism. But others say Gephardt may also need the
jolt of attention that would follow from a Democratic victory in
recapturing the House to convince voters outside of the party's core
constituencies to give him a second look.</TE>
<TE>   "If he doesn't get the House, what is his story?" asks the
Democratic strategist close to Gephardt and Gore. "Without the House,
I don't know where he gets the oomph from to run."</TE>

<HD>Evangelist Criticizes Islamic Clerics</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: Son of Billy Graham says leaders haven't properly
atoned for the terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The son of evangelist Billy Graham, adding to his harsh criticism of
Islam, said Wednesday that Muslim leaders haven't done enough to show
their sorrow over Sept. 11, and he challenged them to help rebuild
New York or compensate the families of victims.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm certainly not preaching against Muslim people," Franklin
Graham said on WBT-AM radio. "I am concerned about our nation, and on
Sept. 11 last year, we were attacked by followers of Islam, claiming
to do this in the name of Islam.</LD>
<LD>   "The silence of the clerics around the world is frightening to me.
How come they haven't come to this country, how come they haven't
apologized to the American people, how come they haven't reassured
the American people that this is not true Islam and that these people
are not acting in the name of Allah, they're not acting in the name
of Islam?"</LD>
<TE>   Franklin Graham, his 83-year-old father's chosen successor to lead
the Billy Graham Evangelistic Assn., also spoke at a book signing
Tuesday in Charlotte, and suggested the compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Masood Khan, chairman of the Charlotte Islamic School board,
said local Muslims were outraged by Graham's words.</TE>
<TE>   "What surprised us is that he's a leader of such stature. But
instead of respecting other faiths, he's spreading hate," Khan said.</TE>
<TE>   Graham writes in his new book, "The Name," that "Islam--unlike
Christianity--has among its basic teachings a deep intolerance for
those who follow other faiths."</TE>
<TE>   Graham also drew widespread criticism in October after he referred
to Islam as "a very evil and wicked religion."</TE>

<HD>Mideast Immigrants' Effect Weighed</HD>
<DH>Demography: Soaring population in U.S. is seen as having
major political and social implications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Immigration from the Middle East has been so heavy in recent
years--and is expected to continue at such high levels--that it is
likely to have significant political and social implications in the
United States, some demographers and other experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The number of Middle Eastern immigrants in the United States has
grown from fewer than 200,000 in 1970 to almost 1.5 million in 2000.
The portion who are Muslims has jumped from 15% in 1970 to 73% in
2000, according to an analysis of census data released Wednesday by
the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that
supports limits on immigration.</LD>
<LD>   "Their successful integration is more important than people had
realized in the past," said Steven Camarota, who wrote the report for
the group.</LD>
<TE>   However, some groups of Middle Eastern Americans and experts on
immigration criticized the report's authors for using the data to try
to further their aim of reducing immigration.</TE>
<TE>   "The anti-immigrant groups have risen up and discovered they can
use the Muslim boogeyman to try to achieve their objective," said
James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "It begins with the assumption that Muslims are scary; they are a
danger to America. And then it seeks to put together faulty data with
bad analysis to prove the point," said Zogby, whose group works for
civic and political influence for Americans of Arab descent.</TE>
<TE>   However, Zogby did agree with the basic findings of the report:
that Middle Eastern immigrants are on the rise and that more of them
are Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Zogby and Camarota also agreed that one of the likely effects of
having more Muslim immigrants voting in U.S. elections is that U.S.
foreign policy toward the Middle East will probably become less
tilted toward Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an emerging counterweight to the people who feel very
strongly about the Arab-Israeli conflict on the other side," Camarota
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure hope it has an impact," Zogby said. "I sure hope it makes
our policy more sensitive. It may not alter the policy in every
instance, but it does help shape the discussion."</TE>
<TE>   The increase in Muslim immigrants was noticeable earlier this year
when three Democratic House members from Michigan, where
concentrations of Muslim immigrants are high, were among the 21
voting against a resolution expressing solidarity with Israel in its
fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars who spoke at a news conference Wednesday announcing the
report stressed the possible negative effects from the increase of
Muslim immigrants from the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, a
Washington-based think tank that seeks to promote U.S. interests in
the Middle East, said that American authorities have to do more to
prevent even a small number of militant Islamic activists from
slipping into the country as immigrants, visitors or students.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our enemy; we must not let it into our house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He asserted that most of the institutions created by Muslim
immigrants are Islamist and are working against mainstream American
principles.</TE>
<TE>   However, Zogby accused Pipes of misrepresenting Muslim immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't come here to Islamize America," Zogby said. "They
came here for economic opportunity and political freedom--the same
reasons other people come to America."</TE>
<TE>   Muslim immigrants and their children, who are bicultural and
bilingual, are helping American companies expand into the Middle East
and assisting the U.S. government in understanding the complicated
region, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Denny, a University of Colorado professor whose research
focuses on Muslims in America, said that since Sept. 11, the image of
respectable Muslim immigrants has been thrown out of focus by the
attention to militant Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot has been done to reinforce negative stereotypes since Sept.
11, and negative attitudes are more freely expressed," said Denny,
who chairs the department of religious studies. "I'm very concerned
about this."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, his research has made him optimistic about Muslim
immigrants in America and their ability to integrate into the society
and make it richer.</TE>
<TE>   "Through my research of a dozen or more years, I have seen Muslim
communities in America be tremendously valuable human resources," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The report found that Middle Eastern immigrants constitute one of
the most educated immigrant groups.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, 49% had at least a bachelor's degree, compared with 28%
of natives.</TE>
<TE>   The median earnings for Middle Eastern men were $39,000, slightly
higher than the average for native workers.</TE>
<TE>   And Middle Eastern immigrants were more likely to become citizens
than other immigrants to the United States. Approximately 55% held
American citizenship in 2000, compared with 38% of immigrants
overall.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>FESTUS, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Twenty-eight people were hospitalized for breathing problems
Wednesday after a leak in a railroad car at a chemical plant sent a
yellowish cloud of chlorine gas spewing into the air in a rural area
of eastern Missouri, police said.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said the
leak at DPC Enterprises, a chemical distribution and production
company about 35 miles south of St. Louis, was contained by
midafternoon. The cause of the leak was not known.</LD>
<LD>   Only one of the people hospitalized was admitted overnight because
of chlorine inhalation, a spokeswoman at Jefferson Memorial Hospital
said. The others were released after being treated for respiratory
distress, shortness of breath, coughing or nausea.</LD>
<TE>   Residents and businesses in the immediate area were evacuated
after the incident, police said.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Cop Sued; Stock Fraud Alleged</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judicial Watch says the leader of Bush task force
took part in securities misdeeds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry D. Thompson, head of a Bush administration
task force on corporate crime, was accused in a lawsuit filed
Wednesday of taking part in an alleged securities fraud while a
director at Providian Financial Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Providian delayed disclosing losses in the second quarter of 2001,
"artificially enhancing and inflating Providian's stock prices," said
a statement announcing the suit by Judicial Watch, a self-styled
public interest group which has sued the Clinton and Bush
administrations before. Investors relied "on a rosy picture of the
company that did not exist," Judicial Watch Chairman Larry Klayman
said at a press conference in Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in federal court in San Francisco, names Thompson,
Providian and other officers of the seventh largest U.S. issuer of
Visa and MasterCard credit cards. It was filed on behalf of a
Dallas-area investor, Robert Lake, who is seeking $75,000 in damages.
Judicial Watch, which sued the Clinton administration 80 times, said
the Thompson case is its second against the Bush administration.</LD>
<TE>   The allegations in the lawsuit are frivolous, Justice Department
spokeswoman Barbara Comstock said in a statement. Thompson's "actions
have been entirely professional and proper at all times."</TE>
<TE>   "The plaintiffs appear to be using Providian to make a political
point," company spokeswoman Laurel Munson said. She refused to
comment on specific allegations.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of Providian's audit and compliance committee,
Thompson and others knew bankruptcies, credit losses and
delinquencies were rising among Providian's customer base and knew
the company wouldn't meet its financial projections in the first
quarter of 2001, the lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson sold about $2.5 million of Providian stock three days
before the company's shares tumbled in July 2001, according to a
financial disclosure statement the Justice Department released last
month. Thompson, the department's No. 2 ranking official, resigned
from the Providian board on May 9, 2001, the day before he was
confirmed by the Senate as deputy attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   That was the same day Providian held its annual meeting and made
alleged misrepresentations about the financial performance of the
company, the Judicial Watch lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush appointed Thompson, a former partner at the Atlanta
law firm of King &amp; Spalding, to head a task force aimed at assuring
the American public the government is getting tough on corporate
fraud.</TE>

<HD>Colo.'s No. 2 Finishes 4th in GOP Primary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>In two years, Lt. Gov. Joe Rogers has gone from sharing the limelight
with George W. Bush at the Republican National Convention to
finishing dead last in a four-way congressional primary.</LD>
<LD>   Rogers, the nation's highest-ranking black Republican in a
statewide elected office, was dogged by questions about his finances
and feuds with state and national party leaders before Tuesday's
primary.</LD>
<LD>   He finished with 13% of the total--3,416 votes--in the race to
fill the newly created 7th Congressional District in suburban Denver.</LD>
<TE>   "It has really been an incredible roller coaster ride the last two
years, all the way down for Joe Rogers," pollster Floyd Ciruli said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Beauprez, a former state GOP chairman with no experience in
elected office, won the nomination with 10,153 votes, or 38%. Rick
O'Donnell, former director of the Governor's Office of Policy and
Initiatives, had 8,203 votes, or 31%; former state Sen. Sam Zakhem
garnered 4,836 votes, or 18%.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers skipped Wednesday's party unity rally and did not return
calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   He was a key speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention
and was seen as a symbol of the GOP's new strategy of inclusion. But
he ran for Congress amid a long-standing feud with Gov. Bill Owens
over office spending. Rogers also refused to repay the state $5,800
for questionable expenses after he was criticized by auditors.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican governor is also running for reelection and is
expected to name a running mate this week. He has said it will not be
Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Rogers angered national party officials by saying he
had been encouraged to run for the House seat by prominent
Republicans including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell and House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas. The
White House said it did not back any candidates in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Beauprez will face former Democratic state Sen. Mike Feeley in
November in a race that is being watched as Republicans and Democrats
battle for control of the House. More than a third of the voters in
the new district are unaffiliated with either party; the rest are
divided almost evenly between them.</TE>
<TE>   In the 4th Congressional District, state Sen. Marilyn Musgrave won
the GOP nomination and will face Democrat Stan Matsunaka in the race
to succeed GOP Rep. Bob Schaffer.</TE>

<HD>Utah Goes Ahead With Permits for Hunting Swans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Utah Wildlife Board has decided to continue allowing tundra swans
to be hunted, despite a legal challenge based on the bird's
resemblance to rare trumpeter swans.</LD>
<LD>   The tundra swan hunting season will be Oct. 5 to Dec. 8. Hunters
have until Monday to put their names in a drawing for one of about
2,000 swan permits.</LD>
<LD>   Trumpeter swans are the largest of all waterfowl, with a wingspan
as great as 7 feet; they stand 4 feet tall, weigh 25 to 35 pounds,
and have a thunderous, low-pitched, bugle-like honk.</LD>
<TE>   They almost disappeared from the Lower 48 states a century ago,
over-hunted for food and feathers. Their numbers have since been
slowly recovering.</TE>
<TE>   But in the air, they are nearly impossible to distinguish from
smaller and more numerous tundra swans, so trumpeters sometimes are
shot by hunters. Hunters must register their birds with Utah wildlife
officials, and if 10 trumpeter swans are found to have been shot, the
season is to be shut down.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that any trumpeter swans are killed has angered some
wildlife groups. They filed a federal lawsuit saying the tundra swan
hunt should be stopped.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Tissue Bank Ordered to Halt Distribution</HD>
<DH>Medicine: The FDA stops CryoLife from selling grafts amid
concerns about bacteria and fungus. One death is linked to its
products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government on Wednesday ordered a Georgia tissue bank whose
products are linked to a death and serious infections to stop
distributing its cadaver tissue, charging that CryoLife Inc. can't
guarantee the grafts are free of fungus or bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   The unusually harsh action by the Food and Drug Administration
comes after months of failed inspections and negotiations with the
Kennesaw, Ga., company, which the FDA said had refused to adopt and
follow procedures to prevent contamination of donated tissue.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA ordered CryoLife to recall all the soft tissue, such as
cartilage and tendons, that it has processed since Oct. 3, a month
before a 23-year-old Minnesota man died of a bacterial infection
linked to CryoLife cartilage received during reconstructive knee
surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Nor can the company resume distribution until it meets federal
standards to ensure the products aren't tainted, said Mary Malarkey,
the FDA compliance officer in charge of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Among the FDA's top charges: that CryoLife sent out tissue from a
cadaver even after it had confirmed the presence of harmful germs in
tissue samples from the same donor.</TE>
<TE>   The order does not recall cadaver heart valves that CryoLife also
provides. But FDA inspectors are studying whether the donated heart
valves, which typically undergo more strenuous processing than soft
tissue, also may pose a risk.</TE>
<TE>   "This order not only protects patients from the unacceptable level
of risk associated with tissue processed by CryoLife, it sends a
clear signal that FDA stands ready to take whatever action is
necessary to ensure the safety of human tissue," said FDA acting
commissioner Lester Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   CryoLife said it would appeal the FDA's order but quarantined all
its donated soft tissue while requesting a hearing to argue its case.
CryoLife also asked the FDA to allow immediate shipment of tissue
needed for potentially lifesaving surgery, such as blood vessels for
heart bypass operations.</TE>
<TE>   But company officials declined to estimate how much tissue would
have to be recalled or how much the crackdown would cost the company.
CryoLife charges hospitals for the costs of processing and
transporting donated tissue.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident about the quality and safety of CryoLife
processed tissue," said company Chief Executive Steven G. Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Malarkey said the FDA would expedite the appeal request, which
would be CryoLife's last recourse, short of going to court, to stave
off the tissue sale shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   Patients who have received CryoLife grafts should not panic,
Malarkey said. Any infection associated with tissue would occur
within days or weeks of the transplant. But she urged doctors to be
aware of signs of infection that might be linked to a contaminated
graft.</TE>
<TE>   The death of Brian Lykins of Willmar, Minn., touched off a major
investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that
concluded infections from cadaver tissue used in orthopedic implants
are more widespread than previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC so far has uncovered 54 infections associated with soft
tissue grafts, 26 of them involving tissue from CryoLife.</TE>
<TE>   "We applaud the FDA action and would hope that this is the final
wake-up call to CryoLife to clean up its house," Lykins' family said
in a statement issued by attorney Don Keenan of Atlanta. "Brian's
life should not be in vain, and it appears that it was his death and
the serious injuries of many other persons that finally brought a
halt to a dangerous company."</TE>
<TE>   Health investigators found a bacterium, Clostridium sordellii, in
Lykins' body and in the cadaver from which the cartilage was donated.
Lykins' family sued CryoLife last month, charging the company left
the cadaver unrefrigerated for 19 hours and failed to test it for the
germ. Several other lawsuits connected to graft infections also have
been filed. CryoLife has declined to comment on litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC said the infections, while fairly rare compared to the
hundreds of thousands of grafts performed, show an urgent need to
update federal regulations and industry standards for preventing
tissue contamination.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel there, at this time, is an industrywide problem,"
countered FDA's Malarkey. She said CryoLife's procedures to prevent
contamination are different from most of the industry's and have not
been proved effective.</TE>

<HD>New Design Ideas Sought to Rebuild Trade Center Site</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Unhappy with initial plans, N.Y. officials seek
inspiration from around the globe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Facing almost universal criticism that its initial plans to rebuild
the World Trade Center site were mundane, the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp. returned to the drawing board Wednesday and
launched a worldwide competition for new design proposals.</LD>
<LD>   "This effort to reach out to the finest architects and planners
around the globe significantly expands the search for the best design
talent," said John C. Whitehead, the development corporation's
chairman.</LD>
<LD>   "We have an opportunity here to do something great, and we can't
do anything less than great. That is why we need some new ideas
here," added Roland W. Betts, chairman of the organization's site
planning task force.</LD>
<TE>   "We are looking for excitement, creativity, energy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to reopen the design process means that new plans for
the trade center will not be completed until the spring of 2003 at
the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   When six plans were proposed in July, the timetable called for
narrowing the designs to three by September and selecting a single
proposal by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   But New Yorkers, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, criticized the first round of efforts. The
sentiment was clearly negative when 5,000 people reviewed the plans
in July at one of the largest public hearings in the city's history.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to bring fresh ideas to the process was hailed
Wednesday by Richard Anderson, president of the New York Building
Congress, a private organization of design, construction and real
estate professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has a monopoly on good design," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. M. Stern, a well-known New York architect and dean of
Yale University's School of Architecture, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It means the public process does work, that the politicians have
heard from the public and the public has said that most of the six
existing proposals fell far short of leading the way for the
development of the greatest site in the greatest city in the world,"
Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem may have been a failure of imagination, but
then another part may have been that the designers were given
unrealistic goals or inappropriate goals," Stern continued. "Lots of
balls are now in the air, and it is refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   The development corporation drew up the original six proposals in
concert with Beyer Blinder Belle, a New York architectural and
planning firm that has worked on such major public projects as the
restorations of Grand Central Terminal, Ellis Island and Governors
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new process, up to five teams will be selected on Sept.
30 to prepare additional concepts for the site.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of November, the teams will be required to submit final
drawings, models and other materials. The schedule calls for a public
review by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure the widest possible participation in the competition,
the development corporation said it would place ads in newspapers
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   If the first round of proposals is any indication, the amount of
interest could be immense. On the day the original designs were
unveiled, the development corporation's Web site received more than
50 million hits.</TE>
<TE>   The corporation said Wednesday that the new plans will include
elements that the public supported, such as a tall symbol or
structure that would be recognized throughout the world; a memorial
on the footprints of the twin towers; a mixture of commercial and
retail space in other sections of the site; and a promenade to
Battery Park, where ferries travel to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a "grand and visible station" would be part of a transit
center with subway service and trains to New Jersey, it said.</TE>
<TE>   The organization also said it is possible that residential
housing, a museum or a performing arts center will be part of the
plan, which will include parks and plazas.</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead said the goal is to create "a truly beautiful and
vibrant new Lower Manhattan while appropriately honoring the victims
of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   "My hope is the next stage will not be a beauty contest or a
rearranging of the deck chairs on a sinking ship," Stern said, "but a
real shirt-sleeves-up investigation of what this site and this city
deserves and can be again."</TE>

<HD>4 Whites Plead Guilty in '69 Race Slaying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Four white men pleaded guilty to conspiracy Wednesday in the shooting
death of a black woman during the city's 1969 race riots, saying
police had encouraged them to take part.</LD>
<LD>   "The cops told us it was OK to protect our neighborhoods,"
Clarence Lutzinger said. "They were behind us."</LD>
<LD>   Lutzinger, Rick Lynn Knouse, Thomas Smith and William Ritter
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the
July 21, 1969, death of Lillie Belle Allen.</LD>
<TE>   The men described how they nervously waited with guns as a carload
of blacks strayed into a predominantly white neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "People were screaming, 'They're black! They're black! They're
shooting! They're shooting!' " Knouse said.</TE>
<TE>   Lutzinger, Knouse and Ritter said they fired at the white Cadillac
in which Allen was riding with family members. Smith admitted to
serving as a lookout for 100 or more men, some gang members and some
armed, who witnesses say had gathered to "protect" the neighborhood
from blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, 27, of Aiken, S.C., got out of the car, waved her arms, and
yelled, "Don't shoot!" before being shot, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for testifying against other defendants in the case,
the four men's murder charges will be dropped. They face up to two
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Six men remain charged with murder in the case, including Robert
Messersmith, who is accused of firing the shotgun blast that killed
Allen, and former Mayor Charlie Robertson, a police officer in 1969
who prosecutors say provided bullets to white gang members and
encouraged them to kill blacks.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor has acknowledged yelling "White power!" at a
rally in a city park the night before Allen was killed but says he
had no involvement in the killing and no longer has racist attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   The riots began after a white gang member shot and injured a black
man. Fights broke out, buildings were set ablaze and police
barricaded black neighborhoods. More than 60 people were injured and
100 were arrested before the National Guard arrived.</TE>
<TE>   A grand jury two years ago gave the investigation into the murder
new life after witnesses came forward.</TE>
<TE>   Judge John C. Uhler will decide whether to approve the plea deals.
The four men would be sentenced after the trial of the five
defendants, scheduled for Sept. 23. A 10th suspect is to be tried
separately.</TE>
<TE>   Allen's sister, Hattie Dickson, who was driving the car on the
night of the shooting, attended Wednesday's court hearing. Dickson
said she accepted the fact that prosecutors needed to strike a deal
in exchange for the suspects' cooperation.</TE>

<HD>Gene Changes Key to Talk, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Science: The variations explain why humans can chat but
mice and apes can't, researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A few key changes in a single gene help explain why people can talk
while mice and apes cannot, researchers said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The gene, called FOXP2, seems to be involved in the face and jaw
movements necessary for speech, the researchers in Germany and
Britain said.</LD>
<LD>   What is surprising is that the gene is so similar in animals
ranging from mice to orangutans to chimpanzees, with a relatively
small change having emerged just as modern humans did, between
120,000 and 200,000 years ago, the researchers report in this week's
online issue of the journal Nature.</LD>
<TE>   "It is not the gene that made language possible," geneticist
Wolfgang Enard of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   He said it is probably one of many genes involved in speech and
language, which are complex abilities.</TE>
<TE>   But the gene is clearly important. Research last year found that
people who lack two normal copies of the gene have considerable
difficulty speaking. They not only make mistakes in grammar but
cannot always articulate words clearly.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have [only] one functional copy of the gene, as a human,
you have problems with language and facial movements," Enard said.</TE>
<TE>   Enard, Svante Paabo and colleagues at Max Planck and Oxford
University in Britain looked at the gene in mice, chimpanzees,
orangutans and humans.</TE>
<TE>   It is a highly conserved gene, meaning it has changed little in
the 70 million years of evolution that separate mice from people. But
Enard said it still had "changed a little bit with two amino acid
changes on the human lineage."</TE>
<TE>   Genes are strings of code, with certain patterns making up amino
acids, which in turn are the building blocks of proteins--the basic
cell products that underlie biological processes.</TE>

<HD>Separating Man From Mouse Could Get More Difficult</HD>
<DH>Science: Using rodents as 'bio-incubators' for sperm cells,
researchers may look to human uses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Scientists in Pennsylvania have created pig and goat sperm inside the
bodies of laboratory mice, marking the first time that male
reproductive cells have been produced in such distantly related
species.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers said they hope to use mice as "bio-incubators" to
grow sperm cells for endangered species whose survival is threatened
by a lack of sexually mature males. They also want to produce sperm
from farm animals without waiting for them to reach puberty.</LD>
<LD>   The technique, in which bits of testicular tissue from newborn
pigs and goats were grafted onto the backs of mice, could also
provide an unprecedented window through which scientists may watch
the mysterious process by which sperm develop in various species,
including humans.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, several experts said Wednesday that it won't be long
before human sperm are grown in mice, an advance that scientists and
ethicists said could lead to useful and troubling scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, men who lost their testes before puberty to
surgery or cancer treatment might use the approach to sire children:
After reaching adulthood, they could thaw a preserved smidgen of
their young testicular tissue, have it grafted onto a mouse and,
after allowing time for maturation, extract from the rodents healthy
human sperm.</TE>
<TE>   But the ability to cultivate sperm from immature testicular tissue
could lead to even stranger futures. It could mean that a boy who
didn't survive childhood, or even a male fetus that was never born,
could someday be a father.</TE>
<TE>   Research leader Ina Dobrinski of the University of Pennsylvania
School of Veterinary Medicine emphasized that the team was not
pursuing such applications.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything done with humans would have to undergo scrutiny first by
ethics boards and the whole nine yards," she said. "This is nothing
you'd want to try at home."</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists said they were excited by the prospect of coaxing
mature sperm from immature bits of testicular tissue taken from rare
or endangered animals.</TE>
<TE>   "With endangered species, you lose some of the animals before they
even reach puberty," said Philip Damiani, a staff scientist at the
Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans.
"Many pandas die right after birth. And if we can get testes material
from them that's going to be thrown in the garbage anyway, why not
get the material to work with?"</TE>
<TE>   The challenge has been to convince that tissue to make sperm
outside its normal biological environment. In previous studies,
scientists placed sperm precursor cells from rats and hamsters into
mouse testes, which then made rat and hamster sperm. But experiments
with other species failed.</TE>
<TE>   The Pennsylvania team theorized that sperm precursor cells were
more likely to mature in foreign settings if they remained nestled in
their own testicular tissue, with all its familiar environmental
factors, such as hormonal secretions and micro-tubular structures.</TE>
<TE>   They took tiny samples of testicular tissue from newborn goats,
pigs and mice--each sample a little larger than the period at the end
of this sentence--and transplanted them just under the skin of "nude
mice," whose immune systems are incapable of rejecting grafts.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60% of the approximately 800 grafts survived, and each
of those grew from 10 to 100 times its original size and produced
mature sperm, the team reports in today's issue of the journal
Nature. Some grafts have been producing sperm for more than a year,
in concentrations comparable to those seen in whole animal testes.
And tests suggest the sperm are normal: Mouse sperm produced by the
method fertilized eggs and gave rise to live offspring. (Pig and goat
in vitro fertilization is too primitive an art to serve as a valid
test of the sperm.)</TE>
<TE>   Among other applications, the system could be useful for studying
the effects of toxins and drugs on human reproductive cells,
Dobrinski said.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Talks Hit a 'Bump'</HD>
<DH>Labor: One day after optimism, payroll tax surfaces as
issue that could lead to setting of strike deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball labor talks stalled Wednesday over the contentious issue of
a payroll tax, stirring concern that negotiations are entering a
make-or-break phase with a strike deadline looming.</LD>
<LD>   A day after saying he thought it was "possible to make an
agreement in the next several days," Rob Manfred, baseball's lead
labor lawyer, acknowledged facing a familiar hurdle after meeting
with the Major League Baseball Players Assn. for six hours in New
York. Manfred declined to reveal the setback in a process he has
repeatedly characterized optimistically, but union sources said the
sides were at polar extremes after examining proposals for
implementing the tax owners are demanding.</LD>
<LD>   The union's executive council plans to focus on the status of that
issue in a conference call Friday, determining whether management has
softened its stance enough to postpone setting a strike date.
However, there is growing concern among players that the bridge
cannot be gapped in time, prompting them to prepare for a potential
walkout on Aug. 30, Sept. 2 or Sept. 16.</LD>
<TE>   Negotiations are scheduled to continue today as the sides work to
avert baseball's ninth work stoppage since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "Occasionally in this process, you have bumps in the road, and
today probably would be a bump in the road," Manfred said. "I said
that I was cautiously optimistic that an agreement could be reached
in the next few days. My overall view has not changed despite the
fact that I recognize today was a bump in the road."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe more than that.</TE>
<TE>   Union head Don Fehr declined to discuss the shifting tone of
talks. Fehr has at no point expressed a similar sense of optimism
about negotiations that clearly took a negative turn after the core
economic issue was put under a microscope.</TE>
<TE>   Owners have proposed assessing a 50% tax on clubs with payrolls of
more than $100 million, phasing in the full rate for highest-spending
teams. The union tax threshold, sources said, is in the $139-million
range, and the New York Yankees are the only club projected to
surpass that total next season.</TE>
<TE>   The union plan was met with disappointment by the other side of
the table, especially considering management's insistence on having a
viable mechanism to slow escalating player salaries in the next
agreement. Owners, in effect, are seeking a legal method to promote
spending restraint, trying to regain control lost in decades of
previous collective bargaining without collusion.</TE>
<TE>   The union views a payroll tax as a component of revenue sharing,
another means of transferring money from high-revenue to low-revenue
clubs, maintaining they work in conjunction only to redistribute
revenue. The union is prepared to make further concessions in revenue
sharing, but not if owners continue to push for a wide-reaching
luxury tax, believing the combination would act as a salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe that the difference," Manfred said, "is an
impediment to an agreement at this point."</TE>
<TE>   If proposals for revenue sharing and the payroll tax were
combined, as the union would prefer, the sides would be $150 million
apart, with owners at $400 million and the union at $250 million. In
order to complete a deal, sources said the union might increase its
figure to more than $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Owners also have been rebuffed in their attempts to implement a
minimum $45-million payroll, which the union considers to be another
restraint on salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Although the union would seemingly support all 30 clubs having a
salary floor, it opposes any mandates on spending. The fear is that
owners would eventually seek a hard cap in future negotiations if
players open the door on this issue, saying the benefit of a payroll
floor would be outweighed by a ceiling on the high-revenue teams that
drive the market.</TE>
<TE>   "The floor is the mechanism that we have proposed to ensure that
revenue sharing dollars are put into improving the competitiveness of
the game," Manfred said. "They have been philosophically opposed to
the minimum club payroll, and have maintained that position."</TE>

<HD>Come June, Shaq's Toe, Clark Won't Matter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News item: Shaquille O'Neal to have toe surgery, will probably miss
early-season games.</LD>
<LD>   News item 2: Keon Clark signs with Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Reaction: I don't see either one stopping Shaq in June.</LD>
<TE>   So maybe the Lakers stumble out of the gate while O'Neal completes
his recovery in November. Maybe they don't get the best record in the
Western Conference and the home-court advantage in the playoffs that
goes with it. Big deal. This group is developing into one of the best
road teams in NBA history--they're 15-2 in the purple jerseys over
the last two postseasons.</TE>
<TE>   If the surgery can alleviate the pain he felt throughout last
season, it's worth a few missed games.</TE>
<TE>   Why wait so long? Well, all the Laker regulars needed their chill
time this summer. The three-peat has drained this team. Several
players I've spoken with said they're feeling the effects of the 58
playoff games they've played in the last three years and it's going
to be harder for their bodies to crank up for the next season.</TE>
<TE>   If Shaq rounds into form for the playoffs the way he did last
season, no one will remember the games he didn't play in November.</TE>
<TE>   General fatigue and perhaps a lack of motivation will be the
Lakers' greatest foes as they go for No. 4.</TE>
<TE>   On the court, the top competition comes from the Sacramento Kings.
That would be the case whether or not they signed Clark. But bringing
him to Sacramento doesn't change the hierarchy in the Western
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   We should remember our lesson from two years ago, when Portland
brought in Shawn Kemp and Dale Davis and some people (guilty) thought
that would tip the balance of power. The only things that shifted
were the scales due to Kemp's weight.</TE>
<TE>   Keon Clark is long, athletic and was probably the top big man
available in the limited free-agent market this summer.</TE>
<TE>   He also will be backing up two of the Kings' best players, Chris
Webber and Vlade Divac, which means there probably won't be a lot of
minutes for him if they're both playing well and avoiding foul
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Clark does provide a better scoring threat than current backup big
man Scot Pollard, who looked as if he needed a hand-held Global
Positioning System to find the basket during the Western Conference
finals.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to stopping O'Neal, Clark brings the same to the
table as Pollard: six fouls. Other than that, he can't offer much
more of a defense. Have you ever seen his calf muscles? Skinniest in
the league. They look like a couple of extra-long pens.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he just represents their Plan B in case Webber gets sent to
the slammer. The U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit will seek an
indictment on charges that Webber lied to a grand jury in the
numbers-running case of Michigan booster Ed Martin. If convicted,
Webber could face a maximum of five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Clark could have been a Laker, if they knew then what they know
now. Why isn't he? That would be the guy in jersey No. 3, Devean
George.</TE>
<TE>   The background: George, almost by default, was one of the most
desirable free agents in this market. But teams weren't in a spending
mood, especially after they learned that next season's salary cap
would drop from $42 million in 2001-02 to $40 million. Those teams
that could get around the cap issues were wary of crossing the luxury
tax threshold.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers also knew they weren't in position to easily replace
the youth and athleticism of George, who made great strides during
his third season but faded in the playoffs. But they didn't want to
see their championship roster picked apart piece by piece, so they
acted to keep a player who figured prominently in their rotation.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides agreed to use the Lakers' 2002-03 mid-level
exception of a little more than $4.5 million, and George signed a
contract worth $13.5 million for the first three seasons, with an
option for a fourth at $4.95 million</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, the Toronto Raptors rescinded the $3-million
qualifying offer they had made to Clark, which made him a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers had already played their card. All they had left
was the so-called million-dollar exception (actually worth $1.4
million), and that wasn't going to be enough to lure Clark.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers needed Clark more than the Kings did, and perhaps
that's what King owners Joe and Gavin Maloof were thinking. It's
addition by subtraction--subtracting from the Lakers, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Clark getting cited for marijuana possession while
driving through Illinois last month didn't scare them.</TE>
<TE>   And what did they sign him for? The $4.5-million mid-level
exception.</TE>

<LD>Trot Nixon homered twice as the Boston Red Sox turned a tasty
pitching matchup between Derek Lowe and Jamie Moyer into a slugfest,
beating the Seattle Mariners, 12-5, Wednesday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Sox homered four times, with Nixon hitting a solo shot in
the fourth, when they tied it at 3-3, and a two-run homer in Boston's
seven-run sixth.</LD>
<LD>   Manny Ramirez and Shea Hillenbrand also homered for the Red Sox,
who remained five games behind American League East-leading New York
and two back of the Angels in the AL wild-card race.</LD>
<TE>   Lowe (17-5) earned his fifth consecutive victory to become the
AL's first 17-game winner.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up a solo home run to Edgar Martinez in the third,
Lowe retired 11 consecutive batters before Jeff Cirillo singled to
start the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Moyer (12-5) had Boston in check early. He threw first-pitch
strikes to his first 10 hitters and retired nine of the first 10
before Nixon's first home run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Kansas City 2--Bernie Williams hit an RBI single in
the 14th as the Yankees overcame Mike Sweeney's straight steal of
home to win at Kansas City, Mo. Alfonso Soriano singled with one out
in the 14th off Blake Stein (0-3) and moved to third on Jason
Giambi's two-out single. Williams followed with a single to right
field as the Yankees won for the 16th time in their final at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney stole home with two out in the sixth to give the Royals a
2-1 lead. After Sweeney doubled in a run and moved to third on a
bunt, Sweeney surprised left-hander Andy Pettitte, who was holding
the ball on the mound, by taking off and sliding in ahead of the
throw home. It was only Sweeney's fifth steal of the season and 35th
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Minnesota 5--Geronimo Gil homered with two out in the
top of the 14th to lift the Orioles at Minneapolis. Gil connected off
Tony Fiore (9-3) for his ninth homer of the season and first since
June 18. The Orioles improved to 8-2 in extra-inning games. Rick
Bauer (6-4) pitched four innings of scoreless relief.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas 11, Chicago 6--Rafael Palmeiro hit a three-run homer and
Herbert Perry added a two-run shot to back starter Ismael Valdes as
the Rangers won at Arlington, Texas. Perry had four RBIs and Alex
Rodriguez had an RBI to give him 100 for the fifth consecutive
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Tampa Bay 4--Jim Thome hit a two-run homer and Karim
Garcia added a three-run double as the Indians won at St. Petersburg,
Fla. Cleveland's Ellis Burks had a broken-bat single to left in the
first inning for career hit No. 2,000.</TE>

<HD>Koch Gives A's Relief</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Closer's perfect ninth and Chavez's three-run
homer in first push Oakland to 4-2 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Billy Koch needed only 12 pitches to redeem himself after a shaky
outing.</LD>
<LD>   Koch pitched a perfect ninth inning to reach 30 saves for the
fourth consecutive season as the Oakland Athletics defeated the
Toronto Blue Jays, 4-2, Wednesday afternoon at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Chavez hit a three-run homer, and Jermaine Dye drove in a run
for the A's, who have won two straight after losing their last five
to the Blue Jays. The A's have won 10 of 15 overall.</LD>
<TE>   Shannon Stewart homered for the Blue Jays, who have lost six of
eight.</TE>
<TE>   Koch, whom the A's acquired from Toronto during the off-season,
walked the first two batters he faced and allowed a run on Tuesday
before nailing down his 29th save.</TE>
<TE>   "Any 1-2-3 outing feels great," Koch said. "Pitching effectively,
that's the biggest thing. It was great to do that and not have [A's
Manager Art Howe] have to pull his hair out. I never set a number on
how many saves I want to get because that feels like a limitation. I
just want to do my job."</TE>
<TE>   Said Howe: "That was vintage Billy Koch. He went right after
them."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hudson (9-9) won his second consecutive decision and evened
his record for the first time since he was 3-3 on May 4. He gave up
two runs--one earned--and seven hits in 7 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson has a .690 career winning percentage in the major leagues,
but he hadn't won consecutive decisions since June 30 and July 12.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like, still, when I make mistakes they hit them," Hudson
said. "It also seems like I'm not making as many mistakes and when I
got into those situations, I was able to get the ground balls."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Walker (5-3) gave up four hits and four walks in six innings
but didn't give up a hit after Miguel Tejada's single in the third.
Walker retired 12 of his final 14 batters.</TE>
<TE>   "I just keep throwing too many pitches," Walker said. "When I find
my stuff, it's always too late. Chavez won the game for them in the
first inning."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez hit his 26th homer of the season in the first inning
following Scott Hatteberg's single and Tejada's walk.</TE>

<HD>Order Is Restored by Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After Scioscia protests Tiger lineup, Erstad
finishes four-run rally for 5-4 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Detroit Tigers have had their trouble with fundamentals this
season--hitting and fielding among them.</LD>
<LD>   Add another to the list: getting the lineup straight.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels played Wednesday's game under protest after a bizarre
situation unfolded when the Tigers batted out of order in the second
inning.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, the point was pleasantly moot: The Angels won anyway,
taking a 5-4 victory before 23,391 at Edison Field courtesy of Darin
Erstad's pinch-hit RBI double during a four-run sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad we won the game," first baseman Scott Spiezio said. "I'd
hate to have to follow through with all the protest stuff--and if
they did turn it over, that's not fun either. I'm glad we got it
done."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels trailed, 4-1, before the four-run sixth inning helped
them to their 34th come-from-behind victory of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio drove in three runs and Erstad--in his second-consecutive
pinch-hit appearance--drove in the game-winner in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "Erstad, he's been pretty productive, but we like him in there for
nine innings," Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   By winning, the Angels maintained their two-game lead over Boston
in the wild-card race and moved to one game behind Seattle in the
American League West.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup snafu made a mess of things.</TE>
<TE>   The official lineup cards exchanged before the game had catcher
Brandon Inge batting eighth and third baseman Chris Truby batting
ninth. But the lineup the Tiger players saw before the game--and the
one announced in the stadium--had Truby eighth and Inge ninth.</TE>
<TE>   When Truby came to the plate eighth in the second and struck out
to end the inning, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia noted the disagreement
with the official lineup. But he wanted to wait to protest because
Truby made an out.</TE>
<TE>   When the Tigers came to bat in the third, leadoff hitter Hiram
Bocachica came to the plate--meaning Inge never batted, and the
Tigers completed their first time through the lineup with only eight
batters. (Inge didn't make his first trip to the plate until the
fourth inning.)</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia kept trotting out to complain to crew chief Gary Darling,
finally lodging a protest on two counts. One, that Inge should never
have moved ahead of Truby in the lineup later in the game to hit an
RBI double in the fourth. And two, that the umpires aided Detroit
Manager Luis Pujols by advising him that Bocachica was the correct
batter to start the third after the initial error.</TE>
<TE>   Rule 6.07 states: "When an improper batter bats and reaches base
or is out and no appeal is made before the pitch to the next batter,
or before any play or attempted play, that improper batter is
considered to have batted in proper order and establishes the order
that is to follow."</TE>
<TE>   It was a mess best left alone--and Darling said the Angels
wouldn't have won a protest based on rule 6.07 anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "We were 100% right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia had to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "The umpires are not supposed to counsel [Pujols] on who to send
up," Scioscia said. "All of a sudden Bocachica comes up, which I know
wasn't right."</TE>
<TE>   He also sensed the potential for a mammoth loophole if there was
no penalty for skipping your No. 9 hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's any way you can gain an advantage by a mistake in the
lineup, then something's wrong with that."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were happy to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz (10-9) gave up four runs over 6 1/3 innings to earn
his first victory since July 19 and only his second since June, and
Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his 28th save.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz gave up two home runs--to Bobby Higginson in the fourth and
Shane Halter in the sixth--but nevertheless left the game with a 5-4
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz was only 1-4 in his previous nine starts, and the Angels
have been hoping for signs he is beginning to come around.</TE>
<TE>   "Until you maintain a certain level, probably your confidence
might slip," Scioscia said. "It might be a little from the neck up
right now, but there are some mechanical issues he needs to address.
I feel confident he'll be back and be productive."</TE>
<TE>   For the Tigers, it was another lost night--and another strike
against Pujols, who appropriately claimed the blame even though coach
Felipe Alou posted the incorrect card for the players.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going about it exactly the way it was on the wall," Inge
said. "I mean, there was no way for us to know. What they put up
there is what we go by. It was the same card they put up before the
game.... Then they corrected it, but by that time it was too late."</TE>

<HD>Erstad Is a Hit in the Pinch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels have had a nice bat off the bench the past two games.</LD>
<LD>   It belongs to Darin Erstad.</LD>
<LD>   Left out of the starting lineup for consecutive games because of
what was described as fatigue in his right leg related to a chronic
alignment problem, Erstad delivered run-scoring hits as a
pinch-hitter both nights.</LD>
<TE>   He drove in the tying run in the 11th inning of the Angels'
12-inning victory Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he came to the plate in the sixth with two on and
two out and doubled to left to give the Angels a 5-4 lead, their
first of the game.</TE>
<TE>   His career average as a pinch-hitter: .444 (eight for 18.)</TE>
<TE>   Erstad's leg problem involves his hips and back and is resolved by
therapy, Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're always checking his alignment," Scioscia said. "He's a
guy who obviously plays very hard and plays every day. They have to
keep his back in line."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder Tim Salmon wasn't in the lineup for the fourth
consecutive game since being hit by a pitch on his left hand
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's moving in the right direction," Salmon said, adding that
he'll probably test his hand in batting practice Friday after today's
off day before making a decision about whether to play Friday or wait
until later in the weekend series against Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, who sat out 62 games in 1999 because of a wrist injury, at
first had been alarmed because of a similar sensation.</TE>
<TE>   "The [lack of] strength is familiar, almost like when I hurt my
wrist," he said. "The difference here is inflammation. Time will take
care of that. Before it was torn ligaments. We're dealing with two
different things."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon was trying to stay in shape and look for a positive.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, maybe this is a blessing. You're getting a break after a
long stretch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   During the game, the Angels presented retiring Hall of Fame
Detroit broadcaster Ernie Harwell with an Angel jersey with his name
on the back and the number 55--the number of seasons Harwell has
called major league games.</TE>
<TE>   Harwell, noting he has called Angel games as long as they have
existed, thanked fans for their "warmth and hospitality," and wished
the team success.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Molina brothers appeared in the same game Tuesday for the
first time this season when Jose Molina entered the game at catcher
in the 10th inning.</TE>
<TE>   He replaced Bengie Molina behind the plate after Salmon ran for
Bengie in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers also played in the same game last season, and are
only the second siblings to appear at catcher on the same major
league team in the same season. It had been a while: The others, Amos
and Lave Cross, played for the Louisville Kernals in 1887.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed reliever Dennis Cook is scheduled to throw off the
mound Friday as he takes the next step in his recovery from a torn
rotator cuff. A rehabilitation assignment would be the next major
step as he seeks to return to the active roster by Sept. 1....
Outfielder Johnny Raburn of Class-A Rancho Cucamonga was transferred
to Milwaukee's single-A affiliate High Desert as a player to be named
in the Alex Ochoa trade.... Angel outfielder Julio Ramirez, on the
disabled list since mid-June because of a strained left calf, will
begin a rehabilitation assignment with triple-A Salt Lake City today.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Trojan Prior Faces Ex-Titan Saarloos</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two pitchers from local colleges will square off today when the
Houston Astros play the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Prior, a former Golden Spikes Award winner from USC, will
start for Chicago and Kirk Saarloos, a former Cal State Fullerton
All-American, will start for Houston.</LD>
<LD>   The rookies were the first two players from the 2001 amateur draft
to appear in the major leagues. Saarloos and Prior never faced each
other in college.</LD>
<TE>   Saarloos is 5-0 with a 2.90 earned-run average since being
recalled from triple-A New Orleans last month. Prior has given up
only two runs in his last 15 innings, and he has 15 strikeouts in
that span and two wins over Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Met catcher Mike Piazza was out of the lineup for the
second consecutive game Wednesday, missing a start against the San
Diego Padres after being diagnosed with tendinitis in his left wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza, who is hitting .285 with 23 home runs and 73 runs batted
in, said his wrist began to bother him before batting practice
Tuesday. He took a few swings, decided not to hit and was scratched
from the lineup shortly before the start of the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Diamondbacks put infielder Craig Counsell on the
15-day disabled list because of a sore neck. Counsell missed the last
four games with a pinched nerve. He has started 88 games at third
base, 11 at shortstop and 10 at second base, and is batting .282 with
two home runs and 51 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona replaced Counsell on the roster by activating catcher
Damian Miller, who had been disabled since July 24 with a strained
lower back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston Astro shortstop Julio Lugo will be sidelined for the rest
of the season following surgery to repair a broken left forearm. Lugo
was injured after being hit by a pitch from Kerry Wood during
Monday's game at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Lugo, who had six screws and a plate put in his arm, will be in a
soft cast for two to four weeks and is expected to need 10 weeks to
recover. Houston recalled shortstop Adam Everett from triple-A New
Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jose Rijo hasn't started a game in a pennant race since 1994, when
the players' strike wiped out his last opportunity for postseason
prominence. But Rijo will start for the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday
against Houston, which moved ahead of the Reds into second place in
the NL Central this week.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Bob Boone figures to use several relievers behind Rijo,
who hasn't pitched more than two innings at a time since his return
from the disabled list on July 13.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to feel real happy to get three innings, miraculous if
we get five," Boone said. "I'm not planning on five. We'll get what
we can get. But sometimes, he amazes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milton Bradley underwent an appendectomy and was put on the 15-day
disabled list by the Cleveland Indians. The operation took place at
St. Anthony's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the Indians
were playing the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He was scratched from the
lineup Tuesday night with what the Indians said was stomach
discomfort. Bradley could return in three to four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   To take Bradley's place on the roster, the Indians recalled
outfielder Covelli Crisp, 22, from double-A Akron. Crisp, obtained in
the trade with St. Louis for Chuck Finley, was the Cardinals' minor
league player of the year in 2001.</TE>

<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Here we are at Hazeltine National Golf Club, snugly located in this
Twin Cities suburb, which according to legend, is the Native American
word for "big mosquito." And when they begin the PGA Championship
today at Hazeltine, it must be noted that this layout means something
else--the only players who have a chance are the ones who know how to
dial long distance.</LD>
<LD>   Let's face it, Hazeltine is a long golf course, just as Ventura
Boulevard is a long street and "War and Peace" is a long book.
Hazeltine stretches the tape to measure 7,360 yards, longer even than
Bethpage Black. Remember it? That's where the U.S. Open was staged
two months ago amid a steady stream of complaints by players who said
it was so very unfair because they couldn't hit it far enough to
compete.</LD>
<LD>   Did the PGA of America listen? Yes, of course.</LD>
<TE>   Did Hazeltine get shortened to make it fair for all players?
Absolutely not.</TE>
<TE>   That is not the trend in the majors these days. If you want to see
some trends, there are a bunch of options. You can read fashion
magazines, go look at new cars, check out a dinner menu and see
what's being infused with what, or you can play in one of golf's
major championships.</TE>
<TE>   So at Hazeltine, we've got a 636-yard par-five, which is reachable
in two. Days.</TE>
<TE>   It is the longest hole in PGA Championship history, which is
understandable, as the tee box is in South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, all this "longer equals better" stuff began at Augusta
National in April, when Masters organizers changed nine holes, moved
bunkers and tees and made the course about 300 yards longer. Bethpage
Black was the longest U.S. Open site ever and it was counted as a
rousing success, basically because Tiger Woods won.</TE>
<TE>   Next time there is an open date for the U.S. Open, the USGA is
probably considering filling it with a site that is comparable to
Bethpage. It is called Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   The British Open at Muirfield wasn't much longer than it was in
1992 when it last hosted the Open, so it bucked the trend. Only a
couple of the par-three holes were lengthened. The experts judged
Muirfield's defenses to be adequate if there was bad weather, which
showed up on Saturday and blew almost every score into the Firth of
Forth.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the exception to the rule, which dictates that courses
on which majors are played must be beefed up and lengthened in order
to combat players who hit the ball farther with technologically
advanced clubs and balls.</TE>
<TE>   Seems fair enough, because everybody has to play the same course.
Only it's not fair at all. That's the message that players such as
Nick Price are spreading around. Price is hardly a slouch, not with
three majors to his credit--one British Open and two PGA
Championships--so he's worth listening to.</TE>
<TE>   According to Price, the problem with making the courses so long is
that it takes three-quarters of the field out of the equation. Major
championship golf should not be decided only at the tee, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that there has always existed an advantage for players
who hit the ball longer, beginning with Sam Snead, then Jack
Nicklaus, then Woods. What's the difference now?</TE>
<TE>   Jim Awtrey, the PGA of America's chief executive, says the idea
with Hazeltine was to make it long, but fair.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted that the third hole, the 636-yarder, is not only a
long hole, but also described it as "challenging" because it has good
bunkering and a small green.</TE>
<TE>   Players such as Price might also describe it as "challenging"
because they have no chance to reach the green in two unless the
second shot lands in the back of a golf cart and gets carried there.</TE>
<TE>   As major championship courses get longer and the list of possible
winners supposedly gets shorter, it would be wise this weekend to
keep an eye on such long hitters as Woods, Davis Love III, Phil
Mickelson, Sergio Garcia, Ernie Els and David Duval and maybe some
longshot big hitters, such as Chris Smith or Charles Howell III.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if there is such a premium on bombing the ball off the
tee, how did David Toms beat Mickelson last year and win the PGA
Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club?</TE>
<TE>   Toms is one of the best putters on the PGA Tour, which would seem
to indicate that at some point, the shortest shots can take you the
farthest. And a hole in one Saturday didn't hurt him either.</TE>
<TE>   It also needs to be pointed out that 12 times in the last 16
years, beginning with Bob Tway at PGA National in 1986, the PGA
Championship has been either the first or only major title for the
winner. As far as trends go, this is the one that should catch our
attention. Unless, of course, someone drives the third hole and next
year, every major has a 700-yard par four. Until that time, all
players are advised to know their long distance carrier.</TE>

<LD>A commanding presence at 6 feet 6 1/2 and 301 pounds, Auri Allen is
often asked for autographs by Tennessee Titan fans, reports the
Nashville Tennessean.</LD>
<LD>   Allen, though, would rather play in the NBA than the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   First things first, however.</LD>
<TE>   For Allen, that means the MBA, as in Montgomery Bell Academy. This
month, he'll enter the seventh grade at the Nashville school.</TE>
<TE>   Only 12, he is bigger than Shaquille O'Neal was at that age. He
wears size-18 shoes and he can dunk a tennis ball on a 10-foot
basketball rim.</TE>
<TE>   But talk of college scholarships and the NBA, his mother says, is
premature.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I haven't got to that point yet," says Pam Allen,
who is 6-1 and played basketball at Belmont University. "I'm his mom,
and he's my baby. That's how I look at it. It's tough enough to get
this kid shoes, much less spending time worrying about NBA stuff, or
whatever they call it."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first former USC player inducted into the
Pro Football Hall of Fame?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In full support: Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News, on
Denver Bronco running back Terrell Davis, who is contemplating
retirement: "It might be time for Davis and the Broncos to stop
draining his knees and prop them up on a cushion somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quality control: Furman Bisher of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, who does not share the modern-day belief that
pitching about six innings and "walking off alive" constitutes a
quality start, says Sandy Koufax felt the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "To me," Fisher recalls the Hall of Fame left-hander once saying,
"a quality start is when the starting pitcher is still on the mound
when the game is over and his teammates rush out of the dugout to
congratulate him on the victory."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Puny production: USC rushed for 1,052 yards last season, worst in
the Pacific 10 Conference. In 1981, when he won the Heisman Trophy,
Marcus Allen ran for 1,136 yards in the Trojans' first five games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fade route: UCLA's record in November and December since the 1999
season is 2-6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rule of thumb: Jack Nicklaus, on when kids are ready to play golf
on a regulation course: "When they can play three holes without
chasing a frog."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And a skirt, we assume: Georgia Tech's 1952 football media guide,
reports Tim Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, featured
Marilyn Monroe on the cover, "posing in a Tech sweater."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I scream, you scream: Said Andy Reid, the no-longer-svelte coach
of the Philadelphia Eagles, after an ice cream company named a sundae
in his honor: "This is when you know you have reached the ultimate in
the Chubby Man Club."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago: On this day in 1992, Tony Zendejas kicked a 29-yard
field goal in overtime to give the Los Angeles Rams a 19-16
exhibition victory over the Los Angeles Raiders in front of 56,511 at
Anaheim Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Frank Gifford, who was inducted in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Randy Moss of the Minnesota Vikings "was angry that
he was ignored for the Pro Bowl because 'there was a lot of hating
going on,' " writes Steve Rosenbloom of the Chicago Tribune, "and I'm
thinking, yeah, you were hating going all out on every play."</TE>

<HD>Brown to the Bullpen?</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Tracy might want to take some pressure off
pitcher in his return from the disabled list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Jim Tracy hasn't decided the next step in pitcher Kevin Brown's
return from June 11 surgery for a herniated disk in his lower back,
but he hasn't ruled out the possibility of Brown pitching out of the
bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   "That's not out of the question," Tracy said before Wednesday's
game against the Expos. "Is it a viable option? Maybe. Is it etched
in stone? No. Is it part of several different scenarios? Yes."</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who is being paid $15 million this season, the fourth year
of a seven-year, $105-million contract, has made only one relief
appearance as a Dodger, throwing 1 1/3 innings June 24, 2001, against
San Diego, his first game back from a neck injury that had sent him
to the disabled list.</LD>
<TE>   Though Brown has shown no physical effects from his back surgery,
as well as last September's elbow surgery, he has struggled to find
his command and rhythm in two bullpen workouts since Friday night's
minor league rehabilitation start for triple-A Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the chances of a relief stint, at least at the start of
his return, is a desire on the Dodgers' part to ease Brown back after
a two-month absence, having him face major league batters for shorter
periods of time.</TE>
<TE>   Some felt Brown rushed his rehabilitation from surgery to repair a
torn tendon in his right elbow this spring, and that his quick return
might have contributed to two setbacks that sent him to the disabled
list in mid-April and late May.</TE>
<TE>   And even though Brown loves the responsibility and pressure that
comes with being the team's ace, the Dodgers don't want to place too
big of a burden on the right-hander.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfair to Kevin Brown and the Dodgers to think that if he
comes back, that's our ticket to October," Tracy said. "To do what
we've done in his absence and then to throw everything on his
shoulders, that's not fair."</TE>
<TE>   If Brown objected to the possibility of pitching out of the
bullpen, he didn't show it Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been a possibility the whole time," said Brown, who is 2-3
with a 4.06 earned-run average in nine starts and hasn't pitched
since May 26. "I'm just going to play it by ear. It's no big deal.
What it boils down to is, what's best for the team?"</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said the bullpen's recent woes--Dodger relievers combined
for a 5.90 ERA, seven blown saves and had given up 14 home runs in 21
games before Wednesday night--had no bearing on any decision about
Brown pitching in relief.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with what the bullpen is doing," Tracy
said. "It's about finding the proper procedure to get to the point
where Kevin can reach his expectation level."</TE>

<HD>Finally, Good News for Shuey</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Struggling reliever escapes bases-loaded jam in
seventh inning of 5-2 victory over Expos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Reliever Paul Shuey found himself in an all-too-familiar position
Wednesday night, a spot he has been in almost from the time he first
buttoned up a Dodger jersey after his July 28 trade from Cleveland:
Trouble.</LD>
<LD>   The bases were loaded with one out in the bottom of the seventh,
and Shuey, who had a 10.80 earned-run average, two losses and two
blown saves in his first nine appearances as a Dodger, was clinging
to a one-run lead.</LD>
<LD>   Disaster, however, took the night off.</LD>
<TE>   Shortstop Alex Cora turned Jose Macias' grounder up the middle
into an inning-ending double play, and the Dodgers went on to defeat
the Montreal Expos, 5-2, before 13,416 in Olympic Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey was so excited he thrust his arms into the air, and two
innings later, closer Eric Gagne, rebounding from the game-winning
homer he gave up to Troy O'Leary on Tuesday, punctuated his 40th save
with a pump of the fist as the Dodgers moved a half-game ahead of San
Francisco in the National League wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Cora added three hits, including an RBI single that gave the
Dodgers a key insurance run in the eighth, and Shawn Green smacked
his 35th homer in the third to back the superb pitching of Kazuhisa
Ishii, who gave up two runs--both unearned--and three hits in six
innings to win his first game since July 14.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne became only the third reliever in Dodger history to join the
40-save club, joining Todd Worrell, who had 44 saves in 1996, and
Jeff Shaw, who had 43 saves in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get out there today," said Gagne, a Montreal native
who blew a save for only the third time Tuesday night. "It's good to
come out the next day and get all that negative stuff out of my
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Shuey probably needs more than a day to get all the negative stuff
out of his mind, but Wednesday night was a huge step in the purging
process.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii retired 11 in a row before he tired in the seventh, walking
Orlando Cabrera and Andres Galarraga to open the inning. With the
Dodgers leading, 3-2, Manager Jim Tracy summoned Shuey.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Barrett sent a sacrifice bunt attempt toward the mound.
Shuey fielded the ball, spun quickly and fired to third in time to
force Cabrera for the second out.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the first time I've thrown a guy out at third, ever," said
Shuey, an eight-year veteran. "That was awesome."</TE>
<TE>   His walk to pinch-hitter Brad Wilkerson to load the bases was not.
But Cora fielded Macias' grounder near second base, stepped on the
bag and fired to first in time to nail Macias and end the inning,
sending Shuey's glove and fist skyward.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'Can you believe it?' " Shuey said. "I felt like I've
gone out there, made good pitches, and things just weren't happening
for me. But I made a good pitch [Wednesday night] and got a good
result. The big key is to not get too high off one game. Try to take
some confidence from it and do it again tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Shuey's struggles weighed heavily on the right-hander, who was
having trouble sleeping after his recent rocky outings. He was
acquired to bolster the bullpen, but since the trade, Dodger
relievers combined for a 4-4 record and 5.68 ERA in 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   "This was huge," Shuey said. "It took a little bit of weight off a
lot of shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii (13-7) had similar feelings Wednesday night. He was rocked
for 17 earned runs and 15 hits, including five home runs, in 12 2/3
innings of his last three starts and faced a possible demotion to the
bullpen or even to the minor leagues when Kevin Brown comes off the
disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   But the left-hander responded with his best game in almost a
month.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up two unearned runs in the first inning, Ishii
blanked the Expos on one hit over the next five innings. He struck
out four and walked four.</TE>
<TE>   "Mentally, I was in control of the game," Ishii said through an
interpreter. "I only thought about today's game, and I didn't want to
think about anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii was backed by an offense that banged out 14 hits, including
two each by Dave Roberts, Marquis Grissom, Adrian Beltre and Paul Lo
Duca.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to send our closer out there with some breathing
room," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   For Shuey, it was nice to be able to breathe again.</TE>

<LD>Dodger infielder Alex Cora hit 10 home runs playing in Puerto Rico
two winters ago, and it may have set his career back a year.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I was a power hitter, and that wasn't the case," Cora
said. "It took me a whole year to realize that I had to keep my swing
short and [hit to the opposite field], take what [the pitchers] give
to you."</LD>
<LD>   Cora batted .217 with four homers and 29 runs batted in last
season, and last spring, he lost his starting shortstop job to Cesar
Izturis. But with the switch-hitting Izturis batting .195 from the
left side and Cora's average hovering around .300, Cora, who bats
from the left side, began playing regularly against right-handers in
early August.</LD>
<TE>   Cora, who has put in long hours with batting instructor Jack Clark
in an effort to adjust his approach, had three hits, an RBI and a run
in Wednesday night's 5-2 victory over the Expos, lifting his average
to .299. He stroked a two-out, RBI single to left to give the Dodgers
a two-run lead in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   While second baseman Mark Grudzielanek struggled to adjust to the
eighth spot in the order during the first half of the season, Cora
has provided consistent offense hitting in front of the pitcher this
month.</TE>
<TE>   "I call the eighth spot the black hole, because sometimes you
think they're not going to pitch to you and they come right at you,
and sometimes you think they're going to be aggressive and they pitch
around you," Cora said. "You can't think about anything. You just
have to react."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan has responded favorably to an epidural
injection to alleviate the pain caused by a protruding disk in his
lower back, and he could return to the lineup as soon as Friday night
against the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan flew from Los Angeles to Montreal on Wednesday night and
will join the team tonight, but Manager Jim Tracy said he will hold
him out of the series finale against the Expos, for fear he would
take too much of a pounding on Olympic Stadium's artificial surface.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who is batting .271 with 13 home runs and 50 RBIs, has
missed the Dodgers' last five games. He missed six games in May
because of a lower back strain but did not go on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' game against the New York Mets in Shea Stadium on
Saturday has been changed from 4 to 4:30 PDT to accommodate a pregame
ceremony.... With his solo homer off Montreal starter Bartolo Colon
in the third inning Wednesday night, Shawn Green has hit five home
runs in the last seven games.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Galaxy still can't seem to win in Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   Reserve Jeff Cunningham scored the decisive goal in the 78th
minute as the Columbus Crew beat the Galaxy, 3-2, before 17,860
Wednesday night. Columbus has not lost to the Galaxy at home since
May 17, 1998, going 2-0-2 since.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy, 10-8-3 overall and only 3-6-1 on the road, remained
tied for third in the Western Conference.</LD>
<TE>   Cunningham thinks the victory earned the Crew more than a share of
first place in Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference. He thinks
the victory also earned the team some respect in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully this will be a confidence boost for us and we can carry
it into the next game against Kansas City," said Cunningham.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus (9-10-4) shares first place in the East with Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham headed a ball inside the near post off a corner kick by
Robert Warzycha after entering the game eight minutes earlier.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rare victory for an Eastern Conference team against a
Western Conference opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the five Western Conference teams has a better record than
their counterparts in the East.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a game that we lost, but we felt we were in the game the
whole way," said Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid. "It was not a game where
we felt we were dominated."</TE>
<TE>   Crew Coach Greg Andrulis thought the victory was special.</TE>
<TE>   "I think at times we played our best soccer," he said. "For the
team, it's a psychological boost. Everybody knows they are one of the
best in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Elliot made it 2-2 for the Galaxy in the 66th minute. Cobi
Jones passed to Gavin Glinton, whose shot was blocked by defender
Mike Clark. Elliott scored off the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   The Crew went up, 2-1, in the first half on goals by Kyle Martino
and Edson Buddle.</TE>
<TE>   Jones put the Galaxy ahead, 1-0, in the sixth minute. Tyrone
Marshall slotted a pass toward Jones, who one-timed a shot from 13
yards out past a diving Jon Busch. Sasha Victorine also assisted.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has three goals and six assists since returning from the
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Galaxy named forward McKinley Tennyson as a
developmental replacement player. Tennyson, who plays with the
Portland Timbers of the A-League, will join the Galaxy after the end
of that season.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Kansas City 1--DaMarcus Beasley, Hristo Stoitchkov,
Josh Wolff and Ante Razov each had a goal and an assist to lead the
Fire before 15,919 at Naperville, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire (9-9-4) moved into a tie with the Crew for first place in
the Eastern Conference. Kansas City (8-7-8) remains last in the West.</TE>

<LD>The wait is over. Maggies Pants, a 13-year-old gelding, will make his
first start since Oct. 14, 2000, against five others in today's
fourth at Ferndale.</LD>
<LD>   A California-bred owned by James Breeden, who also used to train
the dark bay, and trained by Keith Didio, Maggies Pants, who was born
in 1989, is still a maiden.</LD>
<LD>   In a career dotted with numerous layoff lines, Maggies Pants has
only run 23 times. All he has managed in those races is one second
and one third.</LD>
<TE>   Last seen finishing last in a field of eight at 30-1 at Fresno,
Maggies Pants will be ridden by a jockey (George Memis) who had lost
with 103 of his first 104 mounts this year. Still, he is the only
member of today's field who has hit the board. The other five
entrants in the seven-furlong race are winless in 29.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bring Home Thegold, who broke his maiden at Del
Mar last year, makes his first start since Feb. 28 for trainer John
Shirreffs in today's seventh at Del Mar. The $68,000 optional claimer
is at one mile on the main track and also lured Pie N Burger and
Truly A Judge, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Shug McGaughey. The trainer is off to a hot start at
Saratoga. His victory with Lady Liberty in Wednesday's second was his
seventh of the season, leaving him third in the standings behind Bill
Mott and Todd Pletcher. McGaughey doesn't have any entrants today.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Mike Mitchell. The trainer began the Del Mar meet with
one win in 21 starters.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Mountain Flag in the
third, using Swingin Swiss and Mr. J's Girl in the fourth and Fast N
Nab, Manly Valentine and Digniflite in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/39. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.20/$223.80. Total money bet: $324.</TE>

<HD>Eligibility of Harlem Players Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Little League: Report says three athletes on Mid-Atlantic
regional championship team live outside boundaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A team from New York captures the imagination of its community, then
conquers the opposition on its way to the Little League World Series.
But allegations swirl about ineligible players.</LD>
<LD>   Here we go again.</LD>
<LD>   With the Little League World Series opening Friday, Little League
is investigating allegations the Harlem team that won the
Mid-Atlantic regional did it with players from outside the league's
boundaries.</LD>
<TE>   Newsday reported Wednesday that as many as three players,
including star pitcher Alibay Barkley, live outside the Harlem Little
League district, according to neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer's Little League World Series in South Williamsport,
Pa., was dogged by scandal when Bronx, N.Y., pitcher Danny Almonte
was discovered to be too old to play. Almonte's team was forced to
forfeit its third-place finish after officials determined he was 14
instead of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Little League received two anonymous messages claiming
three of Harlem's players lived outside the team boundaries and that
several players were too old. To be eligible for this year's
tournament, players could not turn 13 before Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Those charges were investigated and disproved, Little League
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But Newsday reported that three Harlem players appear to live
outside the district--Barkley and shortstop-pitcher Jeremy "Jeter"
Lopez in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, and third
baseman-pitcher Andrew Diaz in Washington Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Van Auken, the spokesman for Little League and a member of
the committee that investigates eligibility questions, said Wednesday
the new allegations involve different players.</TE>
<TE>   Little League is investigating and expects to make a decision on
the allegations within two days, Van Auken said. For now, the Harlem
team remains eligible. Its first game is Saturday against a team from
Clemmons, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason for us to believe at this point that there was
any concerted effort to bend or break any rules here," Van Auken
said. "Harlem Little League is and has been a great example of Little
League's urban initiative and why it works."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley was the starting pitcher and hit a two-run homer Tuesday
night when Harlem beat Lehigh of Bethlehem, Pa., 5-4, in seven
innings to reach the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Harlem coaches, Bill McGee, declined to discuss the
allegations Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just getting settled in here. If you have any questions
about baseball, we'll be happy to talk about it," he said. "But if
you have any questions about anything else, you should ask the league
officials."</TE>
<TE>   In Hunts Point, one teenager said Barkley was definitely a local
resident.</TE>
<TE>   "He lives here," said Omar Camacho, 13, of the Bronx, who said
Barkley was a regular at local pickup games. "I've known him for a
while. He told me he lives with his mother and two sisters."</TE>
<TE>   Another teenager also said Lopez lived in Hunts Point.</TE>
<TE>   Simply living outside the Harlem league's boundaries might not
make players ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   Although each Little League has distinct geographic boundaries,
there are circumstances under which a player might play outside the
area where he lives. A child can play in any league where his parent
or guardian lives, can continue to play in one league even after
moving to another district and can play in any league where his
parents volunteer.</TE>

<LD>One of the hottest horses on the grounds earlier in the year, BW Old
Smokey will try to start a new winning streak in tonight's seventh.</LD>
<LD>   A 3-year-old gelding bred in Arizona, the son of Pritzi Dash
rattled off four consecutive wins before finishing second and third
in his last two starts.</LD>
<LD>   BW Old Smokey, who is owned by Rutilo Romero and trained by Paul
Jones, will be making his first appearance since chasing Bac To
Streak and Fly Home First in the Mega Dash Handicap on June 28.</LD>
<TE>   Jockey Ramon Sanchez will be in his usual spot on BW Old Smokey,
who will break from Post 5 in the field of six. The field in the
$12,550 allowance at 350 yards includes Tux N Rolls, Yak Ity Yak Go,
Justa Dance and Fulcrum.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Contreras. 2. Sexy Seabreeze. 3. Make A Rare Run. 4.
Frenchly. 5. Dealadash. 6. Proyen. 7. BW Old Smokey. 8. Control
Freak.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the fifth, use Dealadash, Justa Diva and A Royal Of
Class; use Proyen and Fat Tuesday in the sixth, single BW Old Smokey
in the seventh and use the entry of Peggy Perfect-Control Freak,
Jussis, Quick Ta Shine, Hey Cuz and Betty Jean Hawkins in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Xelodonia could make the lead against a
paceless field in the second. Beduino Classic debuts in the third
against a weak field.</TE>

<LD>   According to tradition, each enshrinee is presented by a Hall of
Famer of his choice. Bird was inducted in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   "I am honored to be presenting a person I have admired and looked
up to during my whole career," Bird said.</LD>
<TE>   The Bird-Johnson rivalry began in 1979 when Johnson's Michigan
State team beat Bird's Indiana State squad for the NCAA championship.</TE>
<TE>   They spent the better part of a decade wrestling the NBA title
away from each other. The Lakers, with Johnson, won five
championships in the 1980s, and Bird's Boston Celtics won three.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 76er Coach Larry Brown chose Dean Smith, his college
coach at North Carolina, to present him for induction. Tar Heels
women's coach Kay Yow selected Anne Donovan, the center on the U.S.
team she coached to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics. And Willis
Reed, who brought the late Drazen Petrovic to the New Jersey Nets,
was chosen to present the international star.</TE>
<TE>   Presenters for Arizona Coach Lute Olson and the Harlem
Globetrotters have not been announced.</TE>

<HD>Kings Get Bigger, Deeper by Adding Clark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sacramento Kings signed free-agent forward Keon Clark on
Wednesday, adding another big man to square off against the Lakers'
Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-11 Clark played the last 1 1/2 seasons with Toronto,
averaging 11.3 points, 7.4 rebounds and a team-leading 1.5 blocked
shots in 2001-02. He played his first 2 1/2 seasons with Denver,
after Orlando drafted him with the 13th overall pick in 1998 and
traded him to the Nuggets.</LD>
<LD>   "You'll see that his game and the type of game we play are made
for each other," said Geoff Petrie, the Kings' president of
basketball operations.</LD>
<TE>   An athletic forward with impressive jumping abilities and a solid
inside game, Clark was one of the more attractive forwards on the
market this summer.</TE>
<TE>   But the impending luxury tax, and Clark's citation on a marijuana
possession charge last month, might have scared off many suitors.</TE>
<TE>   "His skill level and overall game should fit perfectly with our
team-oriented style of play," Petrie said. "Keon will further
strengthen the size and versatility of our team, and our frontcourt
in particular."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento will work the 221-pound Clark into its frontcourt
rotation with Chris Webber, Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard.</TE>
<TE>   Clark's shot-blocking and rebounding abilities should shore up two
of the Kings' biggest deficiencies last season, when they finished
with the NBA's best regular-season record.</TE>
<TE>   Clark became an unrestricted free agent when Toronto rescinded its
$3-million qualifying offer, citing the impending luxury tax. Clark's
agent, however, told the Raptors that Clark wouldn't play for the
qualifying offer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent forward Rodney Rogers signed a three-year, $9-million
contract with the New Jersey Nets in a move that will reunite him
with former teammates Jason Kidd and Dikembe Mutombo.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers, 31, can opt out of his contract after the first two years.</TE>
<TE>   "He will fit perfectly," General Manager Rod Thorn said. "This
gives us the outside threat we lost when we traded [Keith] Van Horn.
It gives us the toughness he has always shown on the court throughout
his career."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers averaged 11.9 points, 4.5 rebounds and shot 37% from
three-point range last season with the Phoenix Suns and Boston
Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers played with Kidd in Phoenix and with Mutombo in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a prolonged search delayed by the withdrawal of four
candidates, the Denver Nuggets will name assistant Jeff Bzdelik as
their new coach next week, according to a team source.</TE>
<TE>   The hiring was first reported by the Denver Post on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Considered one of the league's top defensive minds, Bzdelik, 49,
was an assistant for six years under Miami Heat Coach Pat Riley. He
joined the Nuggets as a scout last season after leaving the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Bzdelik became a front-runner for the Denver job after assistant
coaches Donn Nelson of Dallas, Eddie Jordan of New Jersey, Phil
Johnson of Utah and Del Harris of Dallas all withdrew their names
from consideration during a six-week period.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets have been seeking a permanent head coach since Dan
Issel was forced out in December after uttering a racially
insensitive remark following a loss. Mike Evans finished the season
as interim coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent guard A.J. Guyton signed a contract with the Lakers.
Guyton, a 6-1 two-year veteran from Indiana, was a second-round pick
of the Chicago Bulls. He has averaged 5.7 points in the NBA.</TE>

tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic defeated Martina Sucha, 6-3, 6-4, and Clijsters defeated
Nicole Pratt, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1. Chanda Rubin, who won last week's

<TE>   Prakash Amritraj, who helped USC win the 2002 NCAA tennis title as
a freshman and won the USTA Boys' 18 Super National Hard Court
singles title Sunday, is among eight American men who received
wild-card entries to the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA singles champion Matias Boeker, Alex Bogomolov Jr., Jack
Brasington, Mardy Fish, Justin Gimelstob, Alex Kim and Brian Vahaly
also were put into the main draw for the year's final Grand Slam
tournament, which starts Aug. 26.</TE>

<TE>   Swimming</TE>
<TE>   World record-holder Michael Phelps won the 200-meter butterfly in
a meet-record time of 1 minute, 54.86 seconds in the U.S. national
swimming championships at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps' swim was the second-best time in the event, behind only

<TE>   Carol Semple Thompson, who at 53 is the oldest player in the
field, won both of her matches. Erica Blasberg of Corona and Walailak
Satarak, a UC Irvine sophomore, both advanced to the round of 16 with
two victories Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   UCLA reserve Asi Faoa reached a financial settlement with a former
student he punched more than two years ago. The agreement is
contingent on Faoa having a professional football career.</TE>
<TE>   The junior defensive end must pay $100,000 to Rodrigo De Zubiria
only if he plays in the NFL within three years after completing his
UCLA eligibility. If Faoa does not play in the NFL, he owes De
Zubiria nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Faoa pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge Sept. 4 and
was sentenced to 180 days in jail, a sentence he has yet to serve. He
has applied for a work furlough program and must appear in court
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dallas Cowboy lineman Nate Newton, 40, was sentenced to 30
months in prison after being caught with 175 pounds of marijuana in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Newton, who faces similar charges in Louisiana, pleaded guilty in
April to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with
intent to distribute marijuana. He could have faced up to 20 years
and a $1-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   Newton, who lives in East Ellijay, Ga., helped the Cowboys win
three Super Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   The New York Rangers re-signed center Roman Lyashenko and
defenseman Tom Poti. The 23-year-old Lyashenko came to the Rangers in
a trade with Dallas. Poti, who played for the U.S. during the Salt
Lake City Olympics, was awarded a one-year, $1.8 million contract
through arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   John Ahlers has been hired to be the Mighty Ducks' television
play-by-play announcer. Ahlers was the Tampa Bay Lightning's
announcer the last three seasons.... Bill Barber, fired as coach of
the Philadelphia Flyers in April, was named director of player
personnel of the Lightning.</TE>

<HD>Lewis Is Ready for First Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time for the Baltimore Ravens to find out if Jamal Lewis can
effectively carry the football--and the team's offense--in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis hasn't played since January 2001, when he capped a
sensational rookie season by running for 102 yards and a touchdown to
help the Ravens defeat the New York Giants in the Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee early
in training camp last year and missed the season after undergoing
surgery. He ran well in mini-camp and at practice this summer but has
been held out of high-contact drills.</LD>
<TE>   Now Lewis will put his reconstructed knee to the test in tonight's
exhibition game against the New York Jets at Baltimore. He will
appear in about six plays, which should be enough to provide him and
the Ravens a progress report. As a rookie, Lewis had 1,364 yards
rushing and 27 receptions for 296 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Having Lewis in peak form is crucial for the Ravens, who have a
new starting quarterback in Chris Redman, a retooled offensive line
and a young receiving corps.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm real excited about Jamal getting the opportunity to get after
it," Raven Coach Brian Billick said. "He needs to take the next
step."</TE>
<TE>   Jet linebacker Sam Cowart is eager to show what he can do after
missing all but one game last season because of a torn Achilles'
tendon. Cowart, who also sat out the final four games of 2000 because
of an ankle injury, left Buffalo to sign a six-year contract with the
Jets in March. He was slowed early in training camp by a sore
hamstring, but has been impressive in practice recently.</TE>
<TE>   Cowart, like Lewis, can't wait to start mixing it up in a game
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely looking forward to getting back to some type of
action," he said. "If you put the hard work behind it, there
definitely is a payoff, which is playing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings released backup quarterback Spergon Wynn and
rookie wide receiver Devin Lewis. Wynn struggled in camp and fell
behind rookie Shaun Hill on the depth chart.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn, a third-year player who went to Minnesota in a trade with
the Browns, started the final two games last season with Daunte
Culpepper and Todd Bouman injured.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is a free agent from Southern.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donte Stallworth, the New Orleans Saints' top draft pick, is in
the middle of another long, lonely week.</TE>
<TE>   While his teammates travel to Miami for the Saints' second
exhibition game, against the Dolphins, Stallworth will remain at
training camp rehabilitating his injured hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Stallworth held out three days of camp until all terms of his
contract were settled. Then, five practices later, he strained his
right hamstring. He has been sidelined since.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco 49ers signed Chad Cota after they put rookie
safety Kevin Curtis on injured reserve because of a knee injury.
Cota, a starter for Indianapolis last season, was cut by the Colts in
February to eliminate his $2-million salary from their payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis, a fourth-round draft pick from Texas Tech, is out for the
season after tearing the medial collateral ligament in his right knee
during the 49ers' exhibition loss to Kansas City on Saturday. After
Curtis' injury, the 49ers had only three healthy safeties--starters
Zack Bronson and Tony Parrish, along with top reserve Ronnie Heard.</TE>
<TE>   To make room on the roster, the 49ers waived punter Andrew Bayes,
leaving incumbent Jason Baker as their only punter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Davis' swollen left knee continues to keep him out of
practice, and the Denver Broncos aren't sure when he'll return. Coach
Mike Shanahan said that Davis' condition had not changed....
Free-agent cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock signed with the New England
Patriots. He is expected to compete for a job backing up Ty Law and
Otis Smith.... St. Louis Ram defensive tackle Ryan Pickett will miss
the next two to four weeks because of a broken left kneecap sustained
last week during practice.... Buffalo Bill guard Ruben Brown and
tackle Jonas Jennings, who anchor the left side of the offensive
line, will miss Friday's game against Minnesota. Brown, a six-time
Pro Bowl selection, is out after bruising a left knee and Jennings
has a sprained ankle. Former UCLA standout Kris Farris is expected to
take Jennings' spot.</TE>

<HD>Glavine, Smoltz Stop Giants, 1-0</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Glavine took care of the first seven innings. Then it came down
to a classic matchup: Barry Bonds vs. John Smoltz.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds flied out to the warning track in the ninth against Smoltz
and the Atlanta Braves held on to a 1-0 victory over the San
Francisco Giants on Wednesday night at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   Glavine won for the fifth time in six starts, but everyone was
talking about the matchup between baseball's reigning home run king
and one of the game's most dominating closers.</LD>
<TE>   "That's what the fans came to see, power vs. power," said Gary
Sheffield, who drove in the only run with a first-inning single. "It
was a win-loss situation, Barry put good wood on it but it stayed in
the park. We won that one tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Even after Jeff Kent flied out to the warning track in
right-center, Smoltz didn't back down from Bonds. The Braves' closer
came in with a 97 mph-fastball on a 3-2 pitch and watched a liner
head toward the deepest part of Turner Field.</TE>
<TE>   Andruw Jones, already lined up about as far back as he could get,
drifted onto the warning track and made the catch in front of the
400-foot sign.</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz got Benito Santiago on a pop up to end the game, earning
his major league-leading 42nd save in 46 chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I was definitely going to challenge Bonds," Smoltz said.
"Obviously, you want to keep it in the park. That was a little
close."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds went one for four with an infield single. He has gone four
games without a homer since becoming the fourth player to hit 600 in
a career.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he refused to talk with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine (16-6) gave up only five hits for his 240th win, tying him
with Frank Tanana and Clark Griffith for 48th on the career list. The
left-hander has given up two earned runs or less in 19 of 27 starts
this season, bouncing back from a brief slump in early July when he
was bothered by a blister.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves got their run after Rafael Furcal led off the game with
a double. He moved to third on a grounder and scored on Sheffield's
single to left.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 7, Cincinnati 2--Tony Womack hit a tiebreaking two-run
double and the Diamondbacks took advantage of catcher Jason LaRue's
mishaps with the knuckleball as the Reds lost at Cincinnati. Womack's
sixth-inning double off John Riedling (1-2) snapped a 2-2 tie and
sent Arizona to its 18th victory in 22 games.</TE>
<TE>   Knuckleballer Jared Fernandez got his elusive pitch working so
well that LaRue could barely get his mitt on it. Arizona scored two
unearned runs in the first as LaRue had three passed balls--one shy
of the major league record for an inning. The catcher also let a
knuckleball get through him for a run-scoring wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   A strained rib cage muscle ended Luis Gonzalez's streak of playing
in 446 consecutive games. Oakland's Miguel Tejada now has the longest
active streak at 391. Gonzalez hadn't missed a game since Sept. 30,
1999, when the Diamondbacks rested players before their first playoff
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 6, New York 2--Brian Lawrence pitched into the eighth
inning and Bubba Trammell and Ron Gant homered as the Padres won at
New York to send the Mets to their 10th loss in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence (11-6) has won four of his last five decisions and seven
of 10. He gave up one earned run on seven hits in seven-plus innings.
He struck out four, walked one and hit two batters. Trevor Hoffman
came on with two on and one out in the ninth and got pinch-hitter
Marco Scutaro to hit the first pitch for a game-ending double play.
Hoffman has 30 saves in 32 chances.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida 1, Colorado 0--Brad Penny pitched eight scoreless innings,
giving up only two hits, and Juan Encarnacion drove in the winning
run in the ninth to give the Marlins the win at Miami. Penny and
Denny Neagle were locked in a pitchers' duel, with Neagle not
allowing a hit until Luis Castillo's one-out single in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The game remained scoreless until the ninth. Mike Redmond led off
with a walk against Victor Santos (0-2). Kevin Millar followed with a
single that sent pinch-runner Homer Bush to third. After Mike Lowell
struck out, Derrek Lee walked to load the bases. Encarnacion hit a
grounder to shortstop Juan Uribe, who bobbled the ball, and could
only get the out at first base as the winning run scored.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Chicago 3--Craig Biggio hit a solo homer and Wade
Miller won his career-best seventh consecutive decision to help the
Astros win at Chicago. Sammy Sosa hit a two-run single with two out
in the eighth inning, and pinch-hitter Angel Echevarria drove in
another run off of rookie Ricky Stone in the ninth. But Stone, in his
first major league save opportunity, struck out Mark Bellhorn to
preserve the victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, Pittsburgh 3--Edgar Renteria homered and drove in
three runs as the Cardinals won at Pittsburgh for their fifth
consecutive victory. Albert Pujols hit his 27th home run for the
Cardinals, who maintained their three-game lead over Houston in the
National League Central.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Milwaukee 1--Rookie Brett Myers took a shutout
into the ninth inning before settling for his first career complete
game, leading the Phillies to a win at Philadelphia. Myers (2-2), the
No. 12 pick in the 1999 draft, retired 17 of the last 19 batters.</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner SOUND AND VISION</KH>
<HD>Last Call</HD>
<DH>Ernie Harwell is retiring after this season as the Detroit
Tigers' broadcaster, breaking another link to a golden era for
announcers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernie Harwell did not know Chick Hearn. Never met him, never heard
him. And, being Ernie Harwell, he almost apologizes for that
shortcoming.</LD>
<LD>   "Of course I knew of his great reputation and the hold that he had
on this region here," Harwell said Monday evening at Edison Field
before pulling on the headset for the Detroit Tigers' latest defeat
against the Angels. "I never was fortunate enough to hear him."</LD>
<LD>   Harwell, however, can relate to the void that has low-bridged
Southern Californians since Hearn's passing last week. He understands
how a media capital supposedly as savvy and cynical as Los Angeles
can break down, let its guard down, and devote head-of-state-type
coverage to the death of a local basketball announcer.</LD>
<TE>   "I think when a guy comes into a region like Chick did, and
they're here for [a number of] years, people get used to them,"
Harwell said. "People get used to the way you call a game, and you
become like an old slipper that they put on. People feel comfortable
with them.</TE>
<TE>   "And then they take you to the mountains and the beaches and
picnics. Especially with radio, you become the background of their
lives. It's almost like a sports Muzak. You're in the background, you
know, and you're there and they're not listening closely a lot of
times, and then when you say something, maybe they pay attention for
a while and then drift away. You become a part of the family. And
you're a conduit between the team and the public.</TE>
<TE>   "The players change--especially now--and come and go, but the
announcer stays around. He becomes sort of an anchor that they can
hold onto. They really embrace the guy. He becomes a part of their
lives."</TE>
<TE>   Harwell speaks from experience, having witnessed his own memorial
service of sorts nearly a dozen years ago. Hall of Fame broadcaster
and best friend to millions of Tiger fans he never met, Harwell was
fired by Tiger management after the 1990 season, told to take a
farewell tour in 1991 and call it a career after that.</TE>
<TE>   Then 72, after 31 years with the Tigers, he was told he was too
old, his easy-listening style too outmoded for the fast-track,
ironic, sensory-overloaded 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   It became the biggest baseball public-relations blunder to have
absolutely nothing to do with Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger fans revolted, with major Michigan media outlets leading the
charge. After a season's worth of outrage, coupled with a change in
team ownership, Harwell returned to the Tiger broadcast booth in
1993, more or less on demand.</TE>
<TE>   Harwell's hold on that region surprised even him.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think we'd ever have the uproar that they had," he said.
"I thought, you know, somebody would call the ballpark in a couple of
weeks and say, 'Hey, what happened to that guy who used to do the
games?' It was gratifying to me to see people [cared]....</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd come back. Once I got fired, that was it....
Lucky for me, Mike Ilitch bought the team from Tom Monaghan and the
first thing he told me, he said, 'I want you to come back and you can
stay as long as you want to.' I really appreciated the confidence he
had in me. That's probably the most important thing to have happened,
certainly in the latter part of my career."</TE>
<TE>   Now 84, Harwell is currently in the midst of Farewell Tour 2,
which he laughingly calls "a little more embarrassing" than the
first. And, no doubt, happier. This time, Harwell is going out on his
own terms. Given the chance to stay as long as he wanted, Harwell
decided this spring he'd stay until the final out of the Tigers' 2002
season, bringing a 60-year broadcasting career to a close.</TE>
<TE>   "I sort of felt I could work another four or five years," he said.
"But, you know that old gag: 'I heard your last show--and it should
have been.' I didn't want anybody to say that. I wanted to quit while
I was still doing it pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't mind the travel like a lot of guys do. My health's good.
All these things pointed to working some more. But I think you've
just got to make up your mind and arbitrarily say, 'This is it.' So I
just happened to pick this year, rather than wander down the line
another year or two."</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been a good year for the sports broadcasting industry.
Hearn and Jack Buck passed away. Harwell is nearing retirement. Vin
Scully continues to hold the fort at Chavez Ravine, but an entire
era, the golden generation of sports announcers reared on radio
before television changed the craft forever, is fading away before
our ears.</TE>
<TE>   In their wake: a new generation of announcers who, with few
exceptions, sound virtually indistinguishable from each other.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started, everybody was sort of flying by the seat of their
pants," Harwell said. "We didn't have too many models. Now, Vinnie's
so good, everybody imitates him. And you've got a lot of guys that
sound alike. And they have a lot more trained voices than we had.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came along, there were a lot of guys who were coming out
of different occupations like lawyers and newspaper guys. Guys like
that became announcers. They're getting back to that with the
analysts, but the play-by-play guys now are mostly university-trained
and they have their radio-station school and they listen to guys all
the time.</TE>
<TE>   "And I think there is probably a sound-alike syndrome that we have
now that probably didn't happen when Bob Prince and Mel Allen and
[Red] Barber and those guys were working."</TE>
<TE>   Another obstacle confronting today's generation: ESPN, the
worldwide leader in catchphrase contrivances. The influence of
"SportsCenter's" sit-down stand-up routines has been monumental
on--and mostly detrimental to--the new wave of aspiring sportscasters
looking to make its mark.</TE>
<TE>   Harwell has his catchphrases. So did Hearn--enough of them to fill
a full volume. But if Harwell has a lesson to pass along to the
youngsters wanting to try the same at home, it is this: Don't force
it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a certain way off the air, you should be that way on
the air," he said. "Every time I tried to figure out something cute,
it didn't work."</TE>
<TE>   His catch phrases--"Ernie-isms" to his audience--mostly evolved
naturally.</TE>
<TE>   He's out for excessive window-shopping. Harwell: "That's a called
third strike--he just looked at one too many. I just said that one
time and people started calling [to say they liked it]."</TE>
<TE>   He stood there like a house by the side of the road. Harwell:
"Another one where they strike out looking. That's from an old poem I
used to recite as a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Long gone!  Harwell: "That's my so-called signature call. I didn't
even do that until the mid-'80s. It just happened. I began to say,
'It's long ... it's long ... it's long gone' and I sort of reduced it
to 'long gone.' Those things just happen."</TE>
<TE>   They're looking for instant runs. Harwell: "You know in the eighth
and ninth inning, when they're trying to produce some runs. I started
by saying, 'They'd like to open up a can of instant runs.' "</TE>
<TE>   The way Harwell reasons, "You just can't say 'ball' and 'strike'
for three hours. But I think style really should evolve naturally. I
don't think you can say, 'Hey, I'm going to do this or that.' Vinnie
doesn't have any signature calls, really, not like a lot of guys. And
he's probably the best that ever came along."</TE>
<TE>   Scully replaced Harwell in the Brooklyn Dodgers' broadcast booth
in 1950, after Harwell moved across town to the Giants. "My claim to
fame," Harwell said with a laugh. He playfully boasts that he helped
Scully get his big break a few months earlier when Harwell, covering
college football for CBS, had a late switch in assignments, opening
up the game Harwell originally was supposed to work for Scully.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember reading that he did a good job and impressed Red
Barber and when Red thought about hiring a new announcer, he
remembered that," Harwell said. "So that's my contribution to
broadcast history."</TE>
<TE>   Harwell broadcast football, both college and professional, for
many years.</TE>
<TE>   He says he enjoyed the game, but leaves no question as to which
sport is his favorite to call.</TE>
<TE>   "I always felt that football, if you were authoritative and
sounded like you knew what you were talking about and didn't
hesitate, you could say almost anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball people are so much more discerning. The fans know so
much more about the game. Plus, it's a day-to-day thing. You can't
fool 'em as easily over a whole summer as you can on a Saturday
afternoon....</TE>
<TE>   "I think people appreciate you more in baseball. When I did
football, guys in my neighborhood would say, 'Hey, what are you doing
this winter? Oh, you've got a football game this weekend?' In
baseball, they've got to know you're there, because you're on so
much."</TE>
<TE>   Except, for Harwell, no more after 2002.</TE>
<TE>   His future plans include the continuation of his weekly column for
the Detroit Free Press, along with taping "vignettes, about three,
four minutes long" for Fox. Maybe "write a book or two."</TE>
<TE>   But he has ruled out any special appearances in the broadcast
booth.</TE>
<TE>   "I think once you quit, you have to quit," he said. "You can't
fool around anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the current Tiger team clumsily escorting Harwell into
retirement. He would have preferred going out covering a
champion--everyone's in a better mood when the team is winning, he
says--but Harwell can't complain.</TE>
<TE>   When a visitor to the radio booth greeted Harwell, asking him how
it's going, the man who was fired 12 years ago only to rally for a
decade's worth of last laughs, laughed again, winked and cheerfully
replied, "Nothing a 20-game winning streak wouldn't take care of."</TE>

<KH>PGA CHAMPIONSHIP Today-Sunday at Hazeltine National Golf
Club, Chaska, Minn.</KH>
<HD>Could Be a Mall Classic</HD>
<DH>Woods shapes up as the favorite, as usual, but challengers
have hope after Muirfield</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods laughed this week when someone asked if he planned to
visit the nearby Mall of America, as though he was the kind of
tourist who would double-park the Winnebago and run inside to
Visitor's Information to pick up brochures.</LD>
<LD>   Any historical landmarks I should be aware of along Interstate
494?</LD>
<LD>   Woods' itinerary for every tournament is not very complicated.</LD>
<TE>   "House, course, course, house," Woods explained.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is a shop-aholic only when it comes to collecting major golf
championships, and it's not a reach to think he will win his third
major of the season this week at the 84th PGA Championship, which
begins today at Hazeltine National Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the field against Woods has been a losing proposition of
late. He has won seven of the last 12 majors and, though only 26, he
is already a two-time PGA champion, two more than Arnold Palmer won.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' quest for the Grand Slam ended in a downpour defeat at last
month's British Open, yet the march toward posterity continues.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for the rest of the 156-player field is that Woods'
third-round British Open bobble--The Shots (81) Heard Round The
World--means aspiring champions can believe that, in certain
catastrophic conditions, an occasional major title might be wrested
from Tiger's clutch-hold.</TE>
<TE>   Hazeltine National is another major-monster test at 7,360 yards,
the kind of place likely to eliminate from contention anyone who
can't whack a tee shot 280 yards with a three-wood.</TE>
<TE>   The par-five No. 3 hole stretches 636 yards--you might call it the
"Hall of America"--and is a patch of prairie not even Woods can reach
in two shots.</TE>
<TE>   During a Tuesday practice round, dare we say it took Woods three
shots (driver, three-iron, nine-iron) to find the green.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't get there, unless it's downwind," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hole that might decide the championship is the par-four,
402-yard 16th.</TE>
<TE>   Players must carry the ball 220 yards over Hazeltine Lake to reach
the fairway, and most will not dare use a driver because of the
inherent risk.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a signature hole here at Hazeltine," Woods said, "and I
think it's going to be the one that everyone is going to probably
remember."</TE>
<TE>   Hazeltine National has come a long way since it hosted the 1970
U.S. Open. The course, only eight years old at the time, was roundly
savaged by players as being ill-conceived and brutally difficult,
golfer Dave Hill grumbling it had so many doglegs it "looked like it
was laid out in a kennel."</TE>
<TE>   Hazeltine took it on the chin, bounced back to better reviews at
the 1991 U.S. Open, and has generally been praised during practice
rounds this week.</TE>
<TE>   As the last man to trip up Tiger in a major, British Open champion
Ernie Els has understandably been pushed, maybe like a man from a
bunker into battle, to the fore in the never-ending search for a
golfer who will consistently stand up to Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Els isn't so sure he wants to be the Da-man.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm No. 3 in the World Rankings, so I guess Phil Mickelson [No.
2] is it at the moment," Els joked. "Let's see in a couple of years.
I don't even want to think about that. I just want to play as good as
I can. If he's there and I'm playing with him, good. If not, that's
also good. Even better."</TE>
<TE>   If Els is not the guy, then who is?</TE>
<TE>   The PGA has, historically, been the major most likely to produce a
breakthrough winner, a tournament where wannabes have taken home
Wanamakers.</TE>
<TE>   The late Payne Stewart won his first major at Kemper Lakes in
1989. Davis Love III broke the ice in 1997 at Winged Foot, Paul
Azinger won his first major at Inverness in 1993, Vijay Singh his
first in 1998 at Sahalee, and David Toms won the first major of his
career last year at the Atlanta Athletic Club.</TE>
<TE>   The John Daly legend, of course, was born at Crooked Stick in
1991, when he won the PGA as the ninth alternate.</TE>
<TE>   If Woods doesn't bring his "A" game this week, several Hungry
Players Without Majors are ready to pounce:</TE>
<TE>   * Mickelson. The world is waiting, Phil.</TE>
<TE>   "I do feel as though my game is ready," Mickelson said. "I feel as
though I'm ready to come out on top, finally, in one of these
tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson is 0 for 41 in majors but has finished in the top three
of three of the last four played. Mickelson was second to Toms at
last year's PGA, third at this year's Masters and second behind Woods
at the U.S. Open. Mickelson tied for 66th at the British Open, but
links courses have never suited his high-loft game.</TE>
<TE>   As for getting everyone to quit asking the "when" question,
Mickelson says, "Well, there's a very simple resolution of it. If I
get tired of it, I know how to fix it, and I'm trying to resolve it."</TE>
<TE>   * Sergio Garcia. Garcia reminds everyone that he is four years
younger than Woods and that his day will come. Won't it?</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, at 19, gave Woods a run up the fairway at the 1999 PGA at
Medinah before losing by a stroke and seems to have conquered the
"re-grip" problem that plagued him at this year's U.S. Open. Garcia
trimmed Woods' lead to two shots on the final day at Bethpage but
withered all the way to a fourth-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   He was eighth at this year's Masters and tied for eighth at the
British.</TE>
<TE>   * Padraig Harrington. The 30-year-old Irishman tied for fifth at
the Masters, tied for eighth at the U.S. Open, tied for fifth at the
British and is No. 8 in the World Golf Rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "You haven't seen anything yet," Harrington joked this week.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington understands that he has been slow to mature, and is
glad he took up golf as a kid instead of gymnastics.</TE>
<TE>   "Thankfully," Harrington said of golf, "it's a sport that you can
still develop at 30 years of age."</TE>
<TE>   * Thomas Bjorn. The 31-year-old from Denmark tied for 18th at the
Masters and was in the final-day hunt at this year's British Open
before finishing eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was going away from there, I really felt that I had let
one slip away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   * Colin Montgomerie. Time is running out for the 39-year Scot, but
Monty has played well at PGAs past, losing in a 1995 playoff to Steve
Elkington at Riviera and tying for sixth only three years ago.</TE>

<TE>*--*
* What: 84th PGA Championship
* When: Today through Sunday
* Site: Hazeltine National Golf Club, Chaska, Minn
* Length: 7,360 yards
* Par: 36-36--72
* Format: 72 holes, stroke play
* Playoff, if necessary: Three holes, stroke play
* TV: Today--11 a.m.-5 p.m., TNT; Friday--11 a.m.-5 p.m., TNT;
Saturday--8 a.m.-10:30 a.m., TNT; 11 a.m.-4 p.m., Ch. 2; Sunday--8
a.m.-10:30 a.m., TNT; 11 a.m.-4 p.m., Ch. 2
* Purse: TBA ($5.2 million last year). Winner's share: TBA ($936,000
last year)
* Prize: Wanamaker Trophy
* Field: 131 touring professionals, 25 club professionals
* Defending champion: David Toms
* Last year: Toms set the PGA Championship scoring record with a 265,
although his first major championship victory is best remembered for
two shots -- a five-wood from 243 yards for an ace on No. 15 in the
third round, and a wedge from 88 yards on the 18th hole in the final
round that set up a gutsy par. Leading by one stroke over Phil
Mickelson, Toms decided to lay up on the final hole instead of
hitting a five-wood from 210 yards over the water. He hit his wedge
in to 12 feet and made the par putt for a one-stroke victory
* The course: Hazeltine was the idea of former U.S. Golf Assn.
President Totton P. Heffelfinger. It was designed by Robert Trent
Jones Sr. and opened for play in 1962. It held its first major eight
years later (the 1970 U.S. Open) and was roundly criticized,
particularly by runner-up Dave Hill. It was modified by Rees Jones
* Past majors at Hazeltine: 1970 U.S. Open (Tony Jacklin), 1991 U.S.
Open (Payne Stewart)
* Off the continent: A European-born player has not won the PGA
Championship since Tommy Armour beat Gene Sarazen in 1930 in the
finals of match play
* Notable: Twelve of the last 16 winners of the PGA Championship had
never won a major
* Quotable: "You always want to end the year on a good note--every
one of us. It's the last major, and you don't get another shot until
next year."--Tiger Woods
* Next week: World Golf Championships NEC Invitational at Sahalee in
Redmond, Wash., and the Reno-Tahoe Open</TE>

<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>What price glory?</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of winning last year's PGA Championship at the
Atlanta Athletic Club, the previously and
perfectly-happy-being-anonymous David Toms found himself being
stalked by a fan at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.</LD>
<LD>   "I could tell he was staring at me," Toms said. "When somebody is
doing that, I just kind of look the other way or reach down and grab
my phone like I'm talking on the phone or something because it kind
of makes me uncomfortable."</LD>
<TE>   Toms tried to lose the guy, but couldn't. He walked eight gates
and then stuck his nose in a paper, yet the man persisted.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Toms looked at the man and said, "Is there something you
want to say?"</TE>
<TE>   And the guy said, "You know, you're my favorite player. I can't
believe I'm actually meeting you."</TE>
<TE>   Toms was taken aback.</TE>
<TE>   "Stuff like that freaks me out because I'm just a normal person,"
he said Wednesday. "I don't see myself that way."</TE>
<TE>   As a star, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Toms, 35, eventually signed the fan's cap and provided an
autographed picture, but fame is the last thing he wanted in his golf
career.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, it was no problem because no one outside golf
circles knew much about Toms. Last year's PGA title was his first
major, although he has seven victories since joining the tour in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   It did not bother Toms one bit that once, while in a restaurant,
he was asked by management not to seek an autograph from Craig
Stadler, who was sitting at another table.</TE>
<TE>   Toms may be the only guy on tour who doesn't want to be Tiger
Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, and that's a good thing," he said. "I still have a life. I
can go and come as I please. There's certain things he can't do. I
really don't see how he can get in a car at home and go down to
Tinsel Town and go see a movie."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hazeltine National Golf Club is a long course at 7,360 yards, yet
a lot of players say it is a fairer test than the U.S. Open at
Bethpage. There, Woods was the only player who finished under par.</TE>
<TE>   "Not too many guys had a chance at Bethpage," Jesper Parnevik
said. "This week, a lot of guys are going to have a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Davis Love III says of Hazeltine: "This is more like what we play
week in and week out--a more reasonable setup."</TE>
<TE>   Love might have a different opinion should the winds, as expected,
kick up over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Strange, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain, says his wife, Sarah,
helped in designing the clothes the team will wear.</TE>
<TE>   Said Strange: "Would you want to try to dress 12 men for a week by
yourself?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strange did a quick sidestep when he was asked if he would pair
Woods and Phil Mickelson, whose sometimes frosty relationship has
been in the news recently.</TE>
<TE>   Said Strange: "It's none of your business. No, actually, it is
your business. It's for me to know and you to find out. That's nicer,
isn't it? I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Tiger has no time to shop at the Mall of America or enjoy any
of the sights and attractions of the Twin Cities area. That's a
shame, because there's quite a lineup for tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The four-level Mall of America is so big, it has a seven-acre
amusement park in it, called Camp Snoopy, featuring a Ferris wheel
and a roller coaster. Of course, that's not all. There's also the
Cereal Adventure, where you can actually make your own cereal, which
comes in handy when you're hungry. And you can also get your picture
on a box of Wheaties--just like Tiger!</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty more stuff to do in the area.</TE>
<TE>   * Underwater Adventures (Ads say: "Turtley Awesome")</TE>
<TE>   * Minnesota Historical Society (Burma Shave signs, canoes, grain
elevator, windmill and plastic cows to milk).</TE>
<TE>   * Spam Museum ("Get a Taste of Interactive Spam")</TE>
<TE>   * Award Winning City Tours (featuring Mall of America, of course)</TE>

<HD>Hungarian Team Stuns Manchester United, 1-0</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manchester United, one of the world's wealthiest clubs and a two-time
European champion, suffered a shocking defeat Wednesday when it lost,
1-0, in Budapest to Hungarian champion ZTE Zalaegerszeg, in the first
game of a two-game qualifying series for the European Champions
League.</LD>
<LD>   The lone goal, scored in the first minute of injury time by
substitute Bela Koplarovics after a mistake by defender Phil Neville,
means that United will have to win the second game Aug. 27 to qualify
for the 32-team Champions League.</LD>
<LD>   Manchester was without France goalkeeper Fabian Barthez and
England defender Rio Ferdinand, both injured, but should have
overwhelmed Zalaegerszeg, which in May became Hungarian champion for
only the first time in its 82-year history.</LD>
<TE>   But the Budapest club was inspired by Coach Peter Boszik, whose
father, Joseph Boszik, was one of the "Magic Magyars," the great
Hungarian national team that defeated England, 6-3, in a historic
game at Wembley in 1953 and that reached the World Cup final the
following year.</TE>
<TE>   Making the English team even more uncomfortable, Wednesday's game
was played at sold-out Ferenc Puskas Stadium, where Boszik's Hungary
demolished England, 7-1, in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a shock result," said Manchester United Coach Alex
Ferguson. "They had one attempt, one goal."</TE>
<TE>   Six other former European champions are involved in qualifying and
four of the six are comfortably positioned to advance.</TE>
<TE>   * Four-time champion Bayern Munich traveled to Yugoslavia, where
it shut out Partizan Belgrade, 3-0, on goals by Michael Tarnat, Jens
Jeremies and Claudio Pizarro.</TE>
<TE>   * Five-time champion AC Milan eked out a 1-0 victory at home over
Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic on a Filippo Inzaghi goal and
faces a difficult road game against the Czechs.</TE>
<TE>   * Two-time champion Inter Milan, playing without the still-unhappy
Ronaldo, managed a 0-0 tie against Sporting Lisbon in Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   * Barcelona won, 3-0, at home against Legia Warsaw of Poland, with
Argentine newcomer Juan Roman Riquleme scoring his debut goal for the
Spanish club and Dutchmen Frank de Boer and Philip Cocu getting the
others.</TE>
<TE>   * Scotland's Celtic stunned its 58,520 fans in Glasgow by falling
behind to Switzerland's FC Basel after only 90 seconds, but recovered
to win, 3-1, as Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton and Momo Sylla scored
for the home team.</TE>
<TE>   * Feyenoord of the Netherlands narrowly defeated Fenerbahce of
Turkey, 1-0, in Rotterdam, where Japan World Cup striker Shinji Ono
beat Turkey World Cup goalkeeper Rustu Recber. The return game in
Istanbul will be a test for the Dutch winner of last season's UEFA
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The 16 teams that survive the qualifying stages join 16 automatic
qualifiers in the Champions League, where the 32 teams will be
divided into eight groups of four at a ceremony in Monaco on Aug. 29.</TE>
<TE>   USA Ranked Ninth</TE>
<TE>   The United States, which won the CONCACAF Gold Cup in February and
reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup in June, on Wednesday
achieved its highest placement when it was ranked ninth in the world
by FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans, whose previous best position in the monthly
rankings was 11th, are tied with Italy for ninth place.</TE>
<TE>   New Coach for Portugal</TE>
<TE>   Agostinho Oliveira  was named coach of Portugal's national team on
a trial basis and will be in charge for difficult road games against
England on Sept. 7 and Sweden on Oct. 16.</TE>
<TE>   He replaces Antonio Oliveira (no relation), who was fired after
Portugal's ouster in the first round of the World Cup.</TE>

<HD>Storm Is Brewing in Seattle</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: There's no love lost between the Sparks and
their first-round playoff opponent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Sparks acknowledge there were times in a 32-game schedule that
their attention wandered and that they couldn't wait to get to the
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I have an idea what the Lakers went through," said one
player last week.</LD>
<LD>   But there is a difference.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers have shown they can ratchet up their game in the
postseason, winning the last three NBA titles.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks are trying to repeat as WNBA champions for the first
time. And, at least to their opponents, they look less imposing than
they did last year.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle gets the first chance tonight to test Los Angeles'
championship mettle. And the Storm, like the rest of the WNBA, wants
to see if the Sparks turn on a different switch when the playoffs
start. Or if, after a 25-7 record this season and consecutive 28-4
marks before that, Los Angeles is coming back to the pack.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone expects L.A. to win and all the pressure is on them,"
Sue Bird, the Storm's standout rookie guard, said after Seattle lost
to Sacramento on Tuesday in the regular-season finale.</TE>
<TE>   No one feels pressure more than Spark Coach Michael Cooper, who
has tinkered with the team's chemistry in an effort to keep the
Sparks from being robotic and redundant.</TE>
<TE>   It started with the draft-day trade that sent Ukari Figgs, last
season's point guard, to Portland for the draft rights to rookie
Nikki Teasley. It continued last week when Cooper pulled DeLisha
Milton out of the starting lineup for a second time. In Milton's
place he has used Latasha Byears and, currently, Marlies Askamp.</TE>
<TE>   In between, he has rarely let Byears, Sophia Witherspoon and Nicky
McCrimmon keep their seats warm behind regulars Lisa Leslie, Mwadi
Mabika, Tamecka Dixon and Teasley.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel comfortable where we are," Cooper said. "Marlies gives us
a different look. Every now and then you have to put a good role
player in with the starters. Plus we can use all of her six fouls if
we need to. And with DeLisha, we needed someone who could give us
more point production off the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Sparks are not the same team they were last year, they
don't feel as vulnerable as opponents think they are.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost games earlier last year and this time we lost them late,"
Leslie said. "So it can give other teams the belief the Sparks are
beatable. But the playoffs are a different matter and that's the best
part about being champions--you know there is another level to reach.
And we're ready to go to that next level."</TE>
<TE>   The Storm won two of the three games between the teams and handed
the Sparks their worst loss, 79-60, on July 11 in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "They probably have some confidence and I'm glad they do," Dixon
said. "But this is a brand new season. And we know what it takes to
win in the playoffs. It didn't matter who we played in the first
round, but I'm glad we're playing Seattle. They want us. So we're
coming."</TE>
<TE>   There is some bad blood lingering. And it goes beyond the infamous
hair-pulling incident between Leslie and Lauren Jackson during the
2000 Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   Late during the Storm's 79-60 victory, Byears and the Seattle
guard Michelle Marchiniak got into a fight that resulted in Byears
getting a two-game suspension and Marchiniak a one-game suspension.
Byears was fined $1,000 and Marchiniak $500.</TE>
<TE>   Byears said she will behave in the series but expects the
Storm--in particular Marchiniak--to try and rile her.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell them to come on," said a smiling but defiant Byears. "Tell
them all to come on. We know the whole world's eager to beat the
champs. Well, it's time to put up or shut up."</TE>
<TE>   If Seattle is going to spring the upset, several things have to
happen.</TE>
<TE>   The Storm is primarily a perimeter shooting team, but its
collective field-goal percentage (40.8%) does not suggest dependence
on outside shots. Jackson (17.2 points) and Bird (14.4) are the
primary scorers. Seattle needs center Kamila Vodichkova (9.2) and
forward Amanda Lassiter (7.0) to keep the Spark defense from
concentrating on Jackson and Bird.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is the WNBA's highest-scoring team at 76.6 points and
it tries to force the pace. Seattle has to control the tempo and
choose the right times to run.</TE>
<TE>   The Storm can't allow the Sparks' rebounders to dominate. If Los
Angeles has a rebounding edge of seven or greater, Seattle's chances
of winning are dim.</TE>
<TE>   For the Sparks to advance, they can't slip into the mind-set that
Seattle is happy to be in the playoffs for the first time and will
roll over at the first sign of adversity.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle is 11-5 overall and 8-1 at home when leading at the half,
and 6-10 overall when trailing.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers aside, the winner of the series can expect Houston, winner
of four WNBA championships, to be waiting in the next round.</TE>

<HD>McCullough Remains Hamstrung by Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC running back Sultan McCullough, battling transfer Justin Fargas
for a starting job, said Wednesday he intends to seek outside medical
treatment for a sore left hamstring because the condition is not
improving.</LD>
<LD>   McCullough, a senior who gained 1,163 yards two years ago, was
mostly on the sidelines as Fargas took the majority of repetitions
during two-a-day practices Tuesday and Wednesday. "I don't know what
to do," McCullough said. "I keep going to therapy, but ice is not
working.</LD>
<LD>   "I need to see someone who knows about hamstrings and what I've
got because I can't keep doing the same thing I've been doing.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't seen a specialist or doctor.... I'm going to have to go
on my own outside of SC to get something done."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough missed the final six games last season because of a
strained abdominal muscle and had surgery after the last
regular-season game. He finished as the team's leading rusher with
410 yards.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough said he felt healthy Monday after the first day of
camp, but hamstring swelling has since slowed him.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan coaches said they are limiting McCullough's reps because
they do not want the condition to become chronic. But McCullough said
he is frustrated sitting on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm falling behind, but I can't do anything about it," he said.
"I need somebody to say something to me or try to go help me or get
something done, but I've got to go do something myself.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyday I'm hoping to get better but doing nothing about it is
not going to [help it] get better.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just telling me, 'Mind over matter. If want to play you
can come out here and play.' But if I'm 85% and can't do what I can
do when I'm 100%, what's the point of being out here?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond did not practice in the morning
and was admitted in the afternoon to USC University Hospital where he
was scheduled to remain overnight while being treated for an
infection in his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Allmond, a converted receiver who was contending for a starting
job in the secondary, performed well during the first two days of
practice, but irritated stitches he received in the knee after being
hit by a car last week.</TE>
<TE>   Allmond said he began feeling ill after practice Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was throwing up all night and couldn't get out of bed
[Wednesday] morning," he said by phone from his hospital room. "My
knee up to my thigh was swollen."</TE>
<TE>   Allmond said he eventually made it to the training room at USC and
was taken to the hospital where he was treated for a 103-degree
fever. He is receiving antibiotics and expects to miss at least a few
days.</TE>
<TE>   "It pretty much kills me not being there," he said. "I'm fighting
for a spot and I'll be doing the same thing when I get back out
there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the second time in three days, sophomore defensive end Kenechi
Udeze returned a tipped pass for a touchdown during a full-squad
drill against the first-team offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a load of potential and we have experience," said Udeze,
a starter last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the Trojans set to begin workouts in full pads today, players
did not wear shoulder pads during Wednesday afternoon's light
workout. "The third day of camp is traditionally the day that coaches
always dread, but we had a great practice in the morning," Coach Pete
Carroll said....</TE>
<TE>   Defensive lineman Daniel Urquhart was sidelined during the morning
practice because of a stinger in his left shoulder and did not
participate in afternoon drills....</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Frank Candela, a 24-year-old redshirt freshman who

WESTERN CONFERENCE
Sparks vs. Seattle
Records--Sparks 25-7, Storm 17-15
Season series--Storm, 2-1
Schedule--Today at Seattle, 7 p.m., ESPN2; Saturday at Sparks, 1, Ch.
4; Monday at Sparks, TBA, ESPN2*
Update--The Sparks' task of playing--and winning--their final three
games on the road will either have them feeling very sharp or very
stale. Seattle is here because Sacramento got off to a horrible start
due to injuries, and Portland wasn't good enough down the stretch.
Now it's up to forward Lauren Jackson and rookie guard Sue Bird--both
All-Star selections--to show they can take their game up another
notch. Like most WNBA teams, the Storm is strong at home (10-6), and
should it win tonight it would be the third straight win over the
defending champions. The defending-champion Sparks insist they are
not one-year wonders, and they still boast arguably the best starting
five in the league. But with seven losses this season, some of the
Sparks' intimidation factor has ebbed. It will be up to Lisa Leslie,
Mwadi Mabika and DeLisha Milton (if she starts) to lead Los Angeles
to the dominant level it reached last year
Houston vs. Utah
Records--Comets 24-8, Starzz 20-12
Season series--Comets, 2-1
Schedule--Friday at Utah, 6, ESPN; Sunday at Houston, 1:30 p.m.,
ESPN2; Tuesday at Houston, TBA, Oxygen*
Update--Comet forward Sheryl Swoopes returned to her most valuable
player form after sitting out last season because of a torn knee
ligament. Houston would have won the West had it not been for a late
stumble against red-hot Sacramento, which did not make the playoffs.
The Comets have the lowest scoring average of all playoff teams
(64.8), but they are also the league's best defensive team (59.1).
Forward Tina Thompson is as dependable a scorer as Swoopes. But look
out if guard Janeth Arcain, who had a relatively quiet regular
season, regains the form that made her a first-team All-WNBA
selection last year. The Starzz, who joined Los Angeles and Houston
as 20-game winners, were second behind the Sparks in team scoring
average (75.6) and have a solid core in forward Natalie Williams,
guard Marie Ferdinand and center Margo Dydek. But Utah's defense is a
sieve (73.3), and the Starzz have yet to show they can regularly
compete with the Sparks or Comets
EASTERN CONFERENCE
New York vs. Indiana
Records--Liberty 18-14, Fever 16-16
Season series--Liberty, 2-1
Schedule--Friday at Indiana, 4, ESPN; Sunday at New York, 9 a.m., Ch.
4; Tuesday at New York, 5, Oxygen*
Update--This may be the last chance for Liberty veterans Tara
Phillips, Teresa Weatherspoon and Crystal Robinson to capture that
elusive championship ring. But New York--which claimed the East's top
seeding by virtue of a tiebreaker over Charlotte--has lost four of
its last five games. The Liberty was 8-8 on the road this season and
has the second-lowest team scoring average (65.3) among teams in the
playoffs. New York needs Tamika Whitmore to continue her breakout
year. Indiana won eight of its last 11 games to squeeze past Orlando
for the fourth and final playoff berth. The Fever, which barely
scores more than New York (65.5), does have one of the game's
brightest talents in Tamika Catchings. With New York committed to
stopping Catchings, Indiana needs another consistent scoring threat,
especially with guard Nikki McCray slowed by a dislocated right
pinkie finger
Charlotte vs. Washington
Records--Sting 18-14, Mystics 17-15
Season series--Sting, 2-1
Schedule--Today at Washington, 5, ESPN 2; Saturday at Charlotte, 9
a.m., ESPN2; Monday at Charlotte, 4, ESPN2*
Update--In early July, Washington looked like the East's best team,
riding a 10-2 record. But when star forward Chamique Holdsclaw got
hurt, the Mystics went tumbling from the ranks of the league elite,
losing 13 of their final 20 games. Even though Charlotte passed them
on the final day to claim second place, this series--on paper--is the
most competitive first-round match in the WNBA. The Sting, which
reached the WNBA Finals last year after a 1-10 start, won't have the
same Cinderella story line this time around. But it has a playoff
tested nucleus in Allison Feaster, Andrea Stinson and Dawn Staley,
steady role players in Kelly Miller and Tammy Sutton-Brown, and it
was the only East team to average 70 points a game</TE>
