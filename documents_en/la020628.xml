<HD>Stereotypes Sink 'Pumpkin's' Sorority Satire</HD>
<DH>Greek life, long an easy target, is lampooned with little
skill, stranding Christina Ricci in an implausible story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Pumpkin" means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life,
but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson
Broder and his co-director, Tony R. Abrams, in their feature debut.</LD>
<LD>   The result is hit or miss, with a laugh here and there, ultimately
creating an aura of hopeless and drawn-out improbability. The key
problem is that Broder and Abrams have failed to surround their key
characters with three-dimensional people, reducing them to easy
stereotypical targets. What's more, the values embodied by the
fraternity and sorority system have been attacked repeatedly in the
movies, starting at least as far back as "Take Care of My Little
Girl" (1951), and the job has been done far more effectively than
here.</LD>
<LD>   A blond Christina Ricci stars as Carolyn McDuffy, heralded by her
sorority sisters as the most "enthusiastic" member of Alpha Omega Pi
at SCSU (the film was shot at Broder and Larson's alma mater, USC).
The AO Pis have become determined to wrest from the Tri Omegas--whose
house is directly across the street--the Sorority of the Year title,
which the Tri Os have held for 22 years. The AO Pis have gone in for
a bit of ethnic diversity--none but tall Nordic-looking women need
apply to Tri O--but that still hasn't done the trick.</LD>
<TE>   So the AO Pis pick what they consider a killer charity to support,
the Challenged Games, a Special Olympics-type competition for the
mentally and physically challenged. This will involve the girls
helping coach the athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn's initial response is that such a choice is going too far,
risking the AO Pi image. In the throes of a self-serving political
correctness, her sorority sisters swiftly overrule her. When Carolyn
is assigned to a pleasant-looking, gangling youth nicknamed "Pumpkin"
(Hank Harris), she is soon responding to the "beauty of his soul."</TE>
<TE>   In the old Hollywood tradition, Pumpkin's affliction is vague in
the extreme. He may or may not be mentally retarded, and he seems to
have a mild case of cerebral palsy that by the time the film is over
has been reduced to little more than a limp.</TE>
<TE>   Much to her dismay, Carolyn finds herself falling in love with the
sweet-natured Pumpkin, which gives her a drastically changed
perspective on her life, friends and values--and which the filmmakers
would have us believe spells social catastrophe for her. There may be
a valid premise for both comedy and drama here, but despite a game
and wide-ranging portrayal by Ricci, it is not developed in
consistently credible fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Wealth and class can be highly insulating, but Carolyn seems far
too naive for a college senior at the beginning of the 21st century.
This has the unfortunate effect of making her seem not much smarter
than her sorority sisters, airheads one and all. The elasticity and
lack of specificity of Pumpkin's ailment undercut Harris' appealingly
wistful performance.</TE>
<TE>   Until he's required to make a drastically over-the-top move at the
film's climax, Kent (Sam Ball), Carolyn's boyfriend, is the film's
most plausible figure, a brawny, strong-jawed tennis champion who is
clearly considerably brighter and more aware than Carolyn. Carolyn's
and Pumpkin's mothers, however, really sink the film: Mrs. McDuffy
(Lisa Banes) is a shallow Pasadena socialite who is an unapologetic
racist and bigot. Pumpkin's mother (Brenda Blethyn) is possessive to
a degree that can only be described as monstrous.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and a scene of sexuality. Times
guidelines: inappropriate for younger audiences.</TE>

<DL>LONG ISLAND CITY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>It has always been here, east of Manhattan, a sprawl of middle-class
sameness with aluminum-sided houses and ethnic diners.</LD>
<LD>   But does anyone bother to visit?</LD>
<LD>   Now the Picassos and Klees and Pollocks are relocating to Queens,
and in an area that is so indifferent to trendy taste there is not
even a Starbucks. Yet.</LD>
<TE>   There was a fair amount of nervous tittering this week as the
elite art world journeyed to the borough to inspect the Museum of
Modern Art's temporary quarters in Long Island City.</TE>
<TE>   MoMA in midtown Manahattan is closing for three years for a
serious face-lift, and the museum has trucked highlights of its
immensely valuable collection of modern and contemporary art--even
Van Gogh's "Starry Night"--to a gussied-up warehouse in a borough
whose most identifable landmarks are La Guardia and JFK airports and
Shea Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Groups of artists, critics, members and donors were gingerly
ushered to the new site in anticipation of a grand opening for the
public this weekend. Free shuttle buses were provided for the short
ride over the bridge. The No. 7 subway station, near the new
location, was repainted white. Even a particular New York newspaper
cleared the way for the other half of the museum-going
experience--lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "East of Midtown, It's the Art of the Meal" read the cover of its
dining section, offering a list of "remarkably toothsome dining
options," many of them inexpensive, Asian or Turkish, and family-run.
(Interestingly, Zagat 2002 lists 135 restaurants in the West 50s near
MoMA and only eight in Long Island City.)</TE>
<TE>   During a tour Wednesday afternoon, Ronald Lauder, chairman of
MoMA's board of trustees, was eyeing the rehung works from the
permanent collection when he was asked to recall the last time he
came to Queens.</TE>
<TE>   He thought a moment. Recently, he said, on the way "to Long
Island." Grinning, the museum's director, Glenn Lowry asked: "Yes,
Ron, but when was the last time you stopped in Queens?" The cosmetics
magnate, who admitted his mother, Estee Lauder, was born in Corona,
just smiled: "I cash checks all the time down the street," he said,
referring to a bodega on Queens Boulevard, the main drag.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's managers clearly understand the psychic leap
Manhattanites, in particular, must make to cross the East River.</TE>
<TE>   Thus they have mounted one of the most ambitious (and not
inexpensive) publicity campaigns around the move that anyone in the
art world can remember, even commissioning a book by artist William
Wegman in which one of his chic dogs, wearing a polka-dot shirt and
dark suit, takes a two-stop subway ride from midtown to MoMA QNS, as
the location here has been graphically anointed.</TE>
<TE>   The dog is photographed peering out a moving No. 7 train: "What a
view! This is a real adventure," he thinks to himself. "... Am I in
Long Island City? Am I lost? Wait, no, it's a part of Queens too.
Brooklyn must be over there."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, all the hype and hand-holding is intended to ensure that
attendance--1.5 million visitors last year--does not drop off too
dramatically. But museum officials anticipate that daily attendance
will go from 5,000 to less than 2,000. The two other best-known
cultural sites in Queens, P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center (a MoMA
satellite) and the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum, have struggled with
attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "As someone born and brought up here, I can tell you there's no
one more provincial than a native New Yorker," said Jennifer Russell,
MoMA's deputy director for exhibitions and collections. It's not so
much that people are hostile toward Queens, she explained. They just
don't consider it.</TE>
<TE>   To art addicts who have slowly grown comfortable with a borough
like Brooklyn, with its leading museums, artistic lineage and hip
nightlife, Queens has little over-the-bridge charm. It is profoundly
residential and mostly middle class, existing for itself, the biggest
borough with the blandest identity.</TE>
<TE>   But when real estate becomes too valuable elsewhere, the next stop
is often Queens. And so Joel Shapiro, the sculptor and a Queens
native, is moving his studio from Bleecker Street in NoHo to a
factory in Long Island City "with a tremendous space, beautiful light
and an atmosphere of possibility that doesn't feel closed down the
way that Manhattan does."</TE>
<TE>   But would he live in Queens again, abandoning his townhouse on the
Upper East Side and access to $18-a-plate pasta?</TE>
<TE>   "Never," said the Bayside High School graduate. "Queens was the
place I escaped from."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, historically, although artists may have spent their
childhoods here, almost none except Joseph Cornell, who lived on the
wishfully named Utopia Parkway, worked in Queens. One of the only
references in literature to Queens occurs when F. Scott Fitzgerald's
Gatsby drives past the Corona dumps, describing them as "a fantastic
farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque
gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising
smoke."</TE>
<TE>   He was talking about more than 1,000 acres of ashes that later
became Flushing Meadow Park, now the site of the U.S. Open tennis
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Shanley, former publisher of Art in America and a Queens
resident most of his adult life, predicts that at the end of MoMA's
three-year experiment in international living, neither Queens nor the
museum will be much changed.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be the hip thing to do for a while to go to Long Island
City to see the Picasso exhibit and find a new little Italian
restaurant," Shanley said. "But I don't think the experience will
penetrate this elite institution, and I don't see people from the
neighborhoods coming much to the museum. It's too intimidating."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the idea that MoMA will reinvent Queens may seem
patronizing to 2.2 million residents, almost half born outside this
country, many scraping to get by and steeped in their own rich
culture here in "the middle landscape."</TE>
<TE>   That is how L.A. architect Michael Maltzan, who designed MoMA QNS,
referred to Queens, "a space of always becoming, not fully formed."
He spent his early years in tonier Roslyn Heights, farther out on
Long Island.</TE>

<HD>For Independence Day, Local Radio Stations Will Celebrate
America</HD>
<DH>'Morning Edition' will pay tribute to inspirational
locations; several stations will feature American music from classics
to standards to R&amp;B.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether listeners are seeking an accompaniment to their day off at
the beach, a soundtrack for a fireworks display or an aural reminder
of what Independence Day is all about, several Southland radio
stations have scheduled special programming for July 4.</LD>
<LD>   During "Morning Edition," National Public Radio will feature
stories from listeners about the places where they feel most
patriotic, with respondents citing some obvious choices, such as the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Statue of Liberty and the Grand
Canyon, as well as more personal ones, such as a secluded island in
Maine or a rolling field in Kansas. "Morning Edition" airs on KPCC-FM
(89.3) from 5 to 9 a.m., and from 3 to 9 a.m. on KCRW-FM (89.9).</LD>
<LD>   Classical station KMZT-FM (105.1) will feature only American
composers from 6 a.m. to midnight, drawing on the works of Aaron
Copland, George Gershwin, Samuel Barber and others.</LD>
<TE>   Among the offerings will be three performances of Copland's
"Lincoln Portrait," a homage to the 16th president written during
World War II. The music accompanies a narrator, as Copland said, "to
draw a simple but impressive frame about the words of Lincoln
himself." Among the quotations in the piece: "The dogmas of the quiet
past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high
with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is
new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall
ourselves, and then we shall save our country."</TE>
<TE>   The tunes on "K-Mozart's" sister station, contemporary standards
outlet "the Surf," KSUR-AM (1260), will also be made in America. The
playlist from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. includes Tony Bennett singing "I Left
My Heart in San Francisco," Diane Schuur's version of "New York State
of Mind," Frank Sinatra's "Chicago" and others, with Gershwin's
"Rhapsody in Blue" suite played in its entirety at noon.</TE>
<TE>   KCRW will focus on another definitively American genre, rhythm &amp;
blues, for 13 hours on Thursday and next Friday. The station will air
the series "Let the Good Times Roll," a baker's dozen of hourlong
programs highlighting the history and influence of R&amp;B, from its
origins in the 1940s to its crossover success in the 1960s. Starting
with "Jumping the Blues," an examination of Los Angeles as an early
mecca for performers such as Nat King Cole, Charles Brown and Joe
"The Honeydripper" Liggins, the shows will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
on Thursday and from noon to 5 p.m. next Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Other segments will focus on the New Orleans and Chicago sounds,
bawdy lyrics, the rise of Atlantic and Motown Records, doo-wop, soul
and female singers. The series finale, "Our Day Will Come," starting
at 4 p.m. on July 5, will examine that song and others also embraced
by white audiences, the influence of music on the Civil Rights
movement and the effect R&amp;B had on American culture and politics.</TE>
<TE>   The blues from Chavez Ravine will also be represented during the
holiday. For those fans who think bats and balls are as integral to
July 4 as fifes and drums, the Los Angeles Dodgers take on the St.
Louis Cardinals at 3 p.m. in a battle of division leaders, airing on
KXTA-AM (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Baseball junkies looking ahead to the Dodgers' postseason
prospects can switch between that game and another between a pair of
L.A. rivals, the San Francisco Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks,
which begins at 2:30 p.m. on KSPN-AM (1110). KSPN is also carrying
the Indians and Yankees at 9:30 a.m., and--for those interested in an
altogether different ballgame--Major League Soccer's San Jose
Earthquakes visiting the L.A. Galaxy at the Rose Bowl at 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary Christian music station "the Fish," KFSH-FM (95.9),
is sponsoring a pair of "Freedom Celebration" concerts at Cerritos
College Stadium in Norwalk, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 7 p.m.,
with fireworks to follow each. The station will broadcast live from
the stadium from 3 to 7 p.m. on Wednesday, when afternoon DJ Big Wave
Dave will interview that evening's performers, Jennifer Knapp, Audio
Adrenaline and the Katinas.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, KABC-AM (790) will bring all corners of the country and
all types of music together in one program, "In Search of America, a
July 4 Celebration," with Peter Jennings as host, simulcast from
ABC-TV from 7 to 10 p.m. The show will feature performances ranging
from the Boston Pops at the Boston Esplanade to Cajun band Steve
Riley and the Mamou Playboys from Erath, La.</TE>
<TE>   The program will also visit Independence Day celebrations around
the country, from a Native American powwow in South Dakota to a polka
festival in Wisconsin. Billing the show as "pop to pomp, Broadway to
barbershop, classics to country and more," ABC has also scheduled
appearances by Los Lobos, Sheryl Crow, Alicia Keys, Hank Williams Jr.
and gospel singer Sandi Patty for a grand finale.</TE>

<HD>Dialogue Screens at N.Y. Theaters Are Helping Hearing
Impaired</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN GLANVILLE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Until she retired 10 years ago, Vita Licata was a theater fanatic. As
an advertising representative for the show-business publication
Variety, where she handled theater accounts, Licata saw most
productions staged in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Then, shortly before her retirement, doctors found a tumor in an
ear. An operation to remove it, followed by progressive nerve
deterioration, caused her to lose much of her hearing in both ears.</LD>
<LD>   Now 79, Licata can still hear sounds, but she often can't
understand what people are saying, particularly when several are
speaking at once.</LD>
<TE>   For a time, going to the theater--with its cacophony of dialogue,
music and applause--was becoming an increasingly frustrating
experience. "To pay $95 to go the theater and not understand anything
they're saying--it wasn't worth it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Licata's withdrawal was short-lived. She was at a
lip-reading class in Manhattan when she was told about a program,
sponsored by the nonprofit Theatre Development Fund, that could help
her enjoy shows again.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is simple. At one play or musical a month, the group sets
up an electronic screen--about 4 feet by 1 foot--that spells out what
is being spoken on stage. The screen, which is placed on the right
side of the stage, scrolls through the script, displaying three lines
of red digital letters at a time. Where appropriate, sound effects
and intonations are described: "a loud thudding noise," or "in a
sweet, polite manner."</TE>
<TE>   The system is known as open captioning because, unlike closed
captions on television, the display is visible to the entire
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Since she heard about captioning, Licata has again become a
fixture at theaters on and off Broadway. In the past season, she saw
captioned performances of "Thoroughly Modern Millie," "Fortune's
Fool" and many others.</TE>
<TE>   "If there wasn't captioning, I'd be sunk," she says. "It's really
a saving grace for a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   At each captioned performance, the Theatre Development Fund sets
aside 100 to 150 half-priced seats for the deaf and hard of hearing.
It spends about $1,100 to caption each show; the cost goes down if
the fund works the same show again.</TE>
<TE>   The program, budgeted at $18,500, is meant to help people who have
difficulty hearing but who don't know American Sign Language--about
98% of those who are deaf or hard of hearing, according to Lisa
Carling, director of the fund's Theater Access Project.</TE>
<TE>   It's of particular benefit to people like Licata, who still have
some hearing but have trouble separating sounds and discerning
individual words and are not helped by traditional hearing aids,
which merely amplify sounds.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big gray area, where people hear some but they didn't
get it all," Carling says. "It's very frustrating to miss what the
punch line is."</TE>
<TE>   Carling launched the program in 1997, after hearing from
theatergoers that signed performances and hearing aids (both of which
are offered by the fund) weren't enough. She's been a director at the
group since 1984, shortly after giving up an acting career for the
relative stability of nonprofit work.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Carling reports, audiences have been thrilled
with captioning. At a recent captioned performance of "Thoroughly
Modern Millie," reviews were mostly glowing--although more than one
audience member complained that neck-craning was required to take in
both the captions and the action on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, "it's very good, depending on where you sit," said
Sheldon Itzkoff, who was attending the show with his wife. "If you're
sitting up close, and the caption's off to the side, sometimes you
miss things. I twist my head a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Carling says she's aware of the problem but that little can be
done short of putting the screen in the middle of the stage--a
solution not likely to appeal to performers, directors and producers.</TE>
<TE>   Among hearing audience members, few report finding the captions
distracting. At "Millie," several said they didn't even notice the
electronic screen.</TE>
<TE>   Those who did see it admitted to stealing glances at the captions
periodically, especially during rapid-fire song lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   The display is controlled by a caption operator sitting several
rows from the stage, hunched over a laptop computer. The software,
originally developed for court reporting, allows the operator to
scroll through pre-entered text in time with the performers.</TE>
<TE>   Managing the text isn't as easy as it sounds, though. The operator
must be careful not to give away punch lines before the cast speaks
them, for example. And it's always difficult to manage overlapping
dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "At every show, there's a new wrinkle," says Donald DePew, a
freelance court reporter and frequent caption operator. He helped
Carling develop the captioning program five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you do in a musical when three or more people are singing
simultaneously? Can you follow one thread of what's being sung or can
you interweave? The challenge is you're not giving the audience the
full treatment and you want to," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There have been a few spectacular technical snafus too. At a
performance of the play "Art" at the Royale Theatre several years
ago, a mouse nibbled at the cord that connected DePew's computer to
the caption display, causing a momentary freeze-up.</TE>
<TE>   "So now we're always careful about how the cord is placed so it's
not going to be disconnected by some unwanted creature," Carling says
dryly.</TE>
<TE>   At the rock musical "Rent," vibrations from a loud blast of sound
during the show blew out the display screen. "The sign went berserk,"
DePew remembers. "All these weird computer things showed up on the
screen--question marks, zigzags. It was actually pretty cool because
it looked like it was part of the show."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the future, Carling says she's focused on
spreading the word about captioning and making it available.</TE>
<TE>   She plans to travel to Washington, D.C., this summer to help lobby
for laws that would give the deaf and hard of hearing better access
to shows.</TE>
<TE>   Although most theater producers are open to captioning, Broadway
hits such as "The Producers," "The Lion King" and "Mamma Mia!" have
yet to participate.</TE>
<TE>   "Their ticket sales are so strong that they're not at a point
where they want to part with a discount ticket," Carling says. Her
attempts at compromise--offering captioning at full ticket prices,
for example--have also met with indifference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not considered important," she says. "But if you have
someone in the family who's deaf or hard of hearing, it becomes
important."</TE>
<TE>   In the next few years, Carling and DePew hope to offer captioning
in additional venues--such as the New York Shakespeare Festival--and
in cities outside of New York. Both feel confident that with proper
funding and publicity, the system will catch on.</TE>
<TE>   "People are coming back to the theater 20, 30 years after losing
their hearing," DePew says. "And not only do they come back, but
their whole families come with them. It's pretty terrific."</TE>

<HD>A Multimedia Tribute to Billie Holiday, Italian Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American jazz has been enticing classical composers for more than a
century--and beyond that if one includes such antecedents as ragtime,
spirituals and traditional music.</LD>
<LD>   Results of that fascination are apparent in the music of, to name
only a few, Dvorak, Stravinsky, Gershwin, Copland, Bernstein,
Stockhausen and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Since the avant-garde jazz breakout of the '60s, the lines between
genres have become increasingly blurred, as improvisation has
increased in the classical area, and methodology involving aleatoric
techniques, tone rows, complex rhythmic meters, etc., have surfaced
in jazz.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, a growing number of musicians--especially in
Europe--have moved freely from one arena to the other.</TE>
<TE>   Italian trombonist-composer Giancarlo Schiaffini has been active
in both genres since the '70s. On Wednesday night at the Istituto
Italiano di Cultura in Los Angeles, he premiered "Rhapsody for
Billie," a multimedia work including his own trombone playing, the
voice of Silvia Schiavoni, projected photo images by Ilaria
Schiaffini (Giancarlo's daughter) and a prerecorded tape filled with
snippets of sound and rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   The composition was, of course, a tribute to Billie Holiday,
featuring fragments (sometimes more) of songs associated with
her--"The Man I Love," "Lover Man," "Yesterdays," "God Bless the
Child" among them. Behind Schiaffini and Schiavoni, who were
positioned on opposite sides of the stage, a large video screen
offered intermittent, often abstract, usually modified, images of
Holiday.</TE>
<TE>   The song passages unfolded seamlessly around narrative segments
serving as an imaginary Holiday stream of consciousness. Most were
sung and spoken by Schiavoni, with Schiaffini adding dramatic
punctuation, and periodically taking center stage to offer an
instrumental variation.</TE>
<TE>   It was Schiavoni, however, in effect playing both the musical and
the emotional role of Holiday, who brought the work to life,
brilliantly shifting from convincing jazz phrasing and scat-like
blues lines to bursts of soprano shrieks and cries. At its best, her
extraordinary eclecticism was reminiscent of the work of the
versatile contemporary classical singer, Kathy Berberian.</TE>
<TE>   Schiaffini's composition had its uneven moments, especially when
the prerecorded tape relied too heavily upon synthesizer passages.
But whenever Schiavoni's voice was front and center, "Rhapsody for
Billie"--despite its experimental aspects--became a penetrating and
insightful study, through music and sound, of a turbulent jazz life.</TE>

<LD>Who says the news isn't funny?</LD>
<LD>   --CNN promo for Monday's premiere of "Connie Chung Tonight."</LD>
<LD>   "Break a leg," said "Crossfire" fill-in host Dee Dee Myers. She
was publicly wishing luck to CNN's new hotshot minutes before the
debut of "Connie Chung Tonight" on the once-dominant network that now
trails Fox News Channel in ratings for cable's 24-hour news venues.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Chung's show seemed incapable of breaking even a sweat in
its maiden hour.</TE>
<TE>   If television had a three-strikes law, Monday's criminally bad
premiere alone would have made Chung a lifer. Add to that a couple of
strikes later in the week--plus Chung setting a record for saying
"exclusive" during a three-day period--and you had a tossup about
whether her show was a work in regress or progress.</TE>
<TE>   After a gaudy CNN buildup anointed her Goddess of News, Chung's
opening week as CNN's latest designated savior so far has ranged from
dismal to pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday brought Chung's amiable interview with Luciano Pavarotti,
taped at his Italian villa, where he disclosed to her, exclusively,
his plans to retire in three years. Very nice. If he changes his
mind, she can return in 2005 to also hear that, exclusively.</TE>
<TE>   Her third night, meanwhile, affirmed why she probably won't win
many in-house booking wars with softballing Larry King, unless she
changes her way of operating. King offers hard-news and controversial
guests something Chung can't and won't.</TE>
<TE>   A free ride.</TE>
<TE>   She was Connie on the spot Wednesday, for example, with a
combative satellite interview of Michael A. Newdow, whose lawsuit
yielded that day's hot-button ruling by a federal appeals court that
the words "under God" made it unconstitutional to recite the Pledge
of Allegiance in public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Her grilling of him was sharp and provocative, but not out of
bounds. "Are you proud to be an American?" she asked Newdow, who said
that he was.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't back down, nor did she.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the hour, by the way, Chung handled it coolly when a fire
alarm twice halted her live interview with a Sports Illustrated
writer, each time causing her to abruptly break for commercials. It
was ... bizarre. The alarm went off a third time just as she was
going playfully in depth with the "Women of Enron," three former
employees of the fallen energy giant who posed for Playboy after
losing their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "What the heck were you doing when you agreed to do this?" Chung
asked in chatty morning-show style that showed how likable she can be
in some situations.</TE>
<TE>   But not always. When one of these stunners was asked how she felt
about the tanking of her Enron stock, she replied: "Buyer beware."</TE>
<TE>   Which applies at times to "Connie Chung Tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Take Monday night's show. Puh-leeeeeeze! It got off to a bozo
start with Chung's low-yield interview of Colorado wildfire suspect
Terry Barton's brother-in-law. That was billed, misleadingly, as a
chat with Barton's "family."</TE>
<TE>   He told Chung what his wife had told him that Barton had told her.
It was that definitive. Chung introduced the segment, moreover, by
announcing that he believed "it was all an accident." Instead, he
subsequently told Chung the fire was accidental "if she started it."
A crucial difference.</TE>
<TE>   Much worse was Chung's listless taped interview in Milwaukee with
Paul Weiser, the 28-year-old whose name was given to police by "Dear
Abby" columnist Jeanne Phillips after he sought advice from her about
dealing with his sexual fantasies regarding little girls.</TE>
<TE>   At hour's end, Chung said she was unsure whether Phillips acted
correctly in violating Weiser's trust by outing him to the cops. Oh
yeah, like Phillips should have kept silent and just hoped this guy
wouldn't act on his desires and harm a child.</TE>
<TE>   All right, that was Chung's opinion. She's entitled. But earlier
came this:</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly a man who never touched a child was looking down the
barrel of a life prison sentence," Chung announced dramatically in a
live tease for her chat with Weiser before a commercial break.
Afterward, she added that he "faces the possibility of life in prison
on child pornography charges."</TE>
<TE>   Come again? That was either sloppy or intentional deception to
hold her audience.</TE>
<TE>   As Chung herself subsequently reported in a voice-over during
footage of her with Weiser, he was placed on eight years' probation
and required to spend a year on electronic surveillance after
pleading guilty to possessing child porn.</TE>
<TE>   This debacle was capped later by guest Jon Stewart, host of Comedy
Central's TV news-mocking "The Daily Show," joking about coming on
with Chung after her stories on the wildfire and Weiser. He asked,
"You gonna bring the pedophile back in?"</TE>
<TE>   Bring in a comedian, you get comedy.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen just how tough a house viewers of this show
will become. Chung is not at CNN because of her journalism, after
all. That was evident Tuesday when she went "one on one," as CNN
advertised it, with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell about
President Bush's Rose Garden speech urging Yasser Arafat's ouster
from Palestinian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Powell had the interview pretty much his way, meeting Chung's
early attempts to break in with a filibuster. And he finessed it
without answering when she asked him when Bush would call on Israel
to go beyond freezing construction and instead dismantle Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   The question she later asked CNN's Wolf Blitzer in Jerusalem--who
would succeed Arafat?--was the key one she should have asked Powell.
Powell had addressed it in other media interviews that day, along
with another issue she failed to raise after he told her that the
administration would work with a new Palestinian government
"democratically brought through elections": What if Arafat was
reelected?</TE>
<TE>   Chung is a veteran whose lengthy resume includes news anchoring in
L.A. As this week affirms, however, there is nothing magical about
her on camera. At her best she is witty, pleasant (smiles easily,
relates well to some guests) and a plucky (although not always
effective) interviewer who got a bad rap for her disastrous sit-down
with California Rep. Gary Condit (a howitzer couldn't have penetrated
stonewalling Condit that day). She also is generous with her staff,
notably giving producer Betsy Goldman on-air credit Tuesday for
landing that heavily promoted Pavarotti interview.</TE>
<TE>   At her worst, Chung is just not very good.</TE>
<TE>   As if CNN, the nation's pioneer in round-the-clock TV news, could
care. It spent years reporting news pretty much the old-fashioned
way, doing rather well from time to time until bad Bill O'Reilly and
Fox's cheeky news kids began outgunning CNN in the ratings.</TE>
<TE>   This is one chorus line of stars outstepping one another, for
cable news channels are now full, giddy adherents to the personality
syndrome that their older broadcast counterparts and local newscasts
have nourished for decades. As the theory goes: If you like the
presenter, you'll like and watch the newscast. Everything else falls
away.</TE>
<TE>   CNN assumes that Chung--after high-profile stints at CBS and
ABC--enters this arranged marriage with a fat dowry of Nielsens that
will help thwart the advance of Fox and a potential challenge from
below by the new talkier, louder, zanier MSNBC. If that happens, CNN
will be pouting about Chung's flaws all the way to the bank.</TE>
<TE>   So here she is, fronting a show that mimics other cable newscasts
in sporting a full tabloid look, this one encasing its star in big,
whooshing graphics that rank her first in visual clutter if not
audience size.</TE>
<TE>   Chung's newsreader is Anderson Cooper. Moved from CNN's "American
Morning With Paula Zahn," Cooper is available too as host of ABC's
"The Mole." He was also picked by CNN to substitute this week for 7
p.m. "NewsNight" anchor Aaron Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Carrot Top was not available.</TE>

<HD>A Mighty Fortress at Ground Zero? Plans Abound</HD>

<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some wouldn't get a passing grade in Drafting 101. Others aim for the
high-gloss look of Frank Gehry or Helmut Jahn. One even calls for
using a sonic ray gun to defend a new skyscraper at ground zero from
another assault by hijacked jetliners.</LD>
<LD>   Nine months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks reduced the World
Trade Center to rubble, more than 1,300 unsolicited rebuilding
proposals have arrived at the agencies and the architectural firm
taking part in the most closely watched redevelopment project in
American history.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the plans are from professional designers. Yet scores of
others come from non-architects drawing their own designs or getting
help from professional draftsmen.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the projects are downright ugly, wildly unrealistic or
both, like the one from Canada that calls for a 1,506-foot-tall
skyscraper with an 800-room hotel near its summit, not exactly where
skittish travelers want to catch their ZZZZs these days.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the proposals open a window to the popular fascination
with the massive rebuilding effort.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the plan of Derek Turner, 53, a Bahamas-based private
index trader who appears to have equal amounts of money and moxie.</TE>
<TE>   After making a visit to ground zero, Turner says, he awoke from a
dream in his New York City hotel room at 4:20 a.m. on Feb. 17.
Suddenly, he was possessed by "an overwhelming compulsion of what
must be done to rebuild the World Trade Center."</TE>
<TE>   Turner hired Florida architect John Martin to help him; at a May
17 press conference at New York's Grand Hyatt Hotel, they unveiled a
plan that makes the massive twin towers seem slender by comparison.
It calls for a 1,449-foot-tall office building that would consist of
four very chunky cylindrical towers topped by an 11-story pyramid.
Depending on your perspective, the affair resembles four giant
Tootsie Rolls or the Space Shuttle on steroids.</TE>
<TE>   The base of this gargantuan skyscraper would have a glass-domed
biosphere. Inside, more than 2,800 trees would be planted,
symbolizing those killed in New York on Sept. 11. To prevent a repeat
of the terrorist attacks, the skyscraper would be equipped with a
feature right out of a Flash Gordon comic strip: a sonic ray gun that
could shoot down a commercial jetliner.</TE>
<TE>   Is the weapon for real? Turner's publicist, Laura Baddish, insists
that he is "working on that with scientists in two different
countries."</TE>
<TE>   All right, then. Let's give this plan the name it deserves: the
Death Ray Tower. It is hard to imagine a more grotesquely domineering
skyline image.</TE>
<TE>   As unlikely and ungainly as such proposals seem, they are not
being tossed into the circular file of the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp., the city-state agency guiding the redevelopment in
cooperation with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which
owns the site.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you they are regarded as very important pieces of
public input," development corporation spokeswoman Nancy Poderycki
says.</TE>
<TE>   So far, more than 1,100 unsolicited proposals have arrived at the
development commission's Manhattan office. The Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey received 150, and 73 more have been sent to Beyer
Blinder Belle, the New York architecture company that is scheduled
next month to make public six overall plans for the now-cleared site.
The total comes to more than 1,300, though the actual number may be
lower if some designers sent their plans to more than one addressee.</TE>
<TE>   At the development corporation, the plans come from architects and
non-architects. They range from a few lines of e-mail to complex
architectural renderings on sheets of paper. Some advance ideas for
rebuilding the entire site. Others limit building to a memorial. Most
are from the U.S, but many are from foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   What they indicate, Poderycki says, is the "intense global
interest" in ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what they also show is how, in the wrong hands, Daniel
Burnham's famous motto--"make no little plans"--can become a recipe
for overwrought gigantism.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a proposal by a Canadian team that calls for three
108-story office buildings that would frame empty spaces
corresponding to the spots where the twin towers stood.</TE>
<TE>   Surmounting the towers would be a curving "deck," 12 stories high,
that would contain an observatory and an 800-room hotel. At 1,506
feet, the structure would be 23 feet taller than the Petronas Twin
Towers in Malaysia, the world's tallest buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Here are two observations about this plan, which was done by
42-year-old Erik Sieb, an American citizen who is a marketing and
public relations manager in Quebec City, and three collaborators:</TE>
<TE>   * At a time when very few companies would even rent office space
higher than 100 stories, an inn-in-the-sky seems destined to do very
little business.</TE>
<TE>   * It was bad enough to have two World Trade Center high-rises,
because the boxy and banal towers were more about building big than
building well. This plan would give us three.</TE>
<TE>   More practical, perhaps, is a hand-drawn design from Al Burrelli
of Manorville, N.Y., who identifies himself as "an ordinary citizen"
and who suggests four 50-story office buildings that resemble
pint-sized versions of the twin towers. A skeletal structure, like
Seattle's Space Needle, would spring up from the roofs of the office
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Near its top would be a pair of beacons representing the collapsed
twin towers, and the pinnacle of the needle would reach as high
as--or higher than--the twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   Burrelli's plan is a crude version of the one being worked on by
David Childs of the New York office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.
Childs--whose client is Larry Silverstein, the real estate developer
who owns the lease to the World Trade Center--has quietly drawn up
plans for a tower with 65 to 70 office floors, reaching 900 feet or
higher.</TE>
<TE>   Above it would be an empty vertical space, enclosed in a skeletal
extension of the building's superstructure. The void would be a
memorial in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Writing of his own proposal, Burrelli says: "The tower would
instantly become an iconic structure and would provide an
electrifying dramatic presence." Actually, it would look silly. But
at least he's being more realistic than the other big thinkers.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the proposals coming from actual architects are more
modest, although they still are taller than what development
corporation officials seem to have in mind for ground zero. Last
week, Louis Tomson, the agency's president, said in a speech before
the New York Building Congress that new office buildings at the site
probably would rise no more than 60 stories.</TE>
<TE>   The plan Chicago architect John Buenz sent to the development
commission calls for two glass-sheathed 79-story towers that would
frame a curving plaza based on the ancient symbol of yin and yang.</TE>
<TE>   Lining the plaza would be a pair of curving colonnades; pictures
and names of the Sept. 11 victims would be mounted on them.</TE>
<TE>   "Reconstruction of the World Trade Center must be more than a
handsome collection of new buildings with space set aside for a
memorial," says Buenz, 69. "It must express to the world the belief
that human beings can interact, cooperate and respect one another."</TE>
<TE>   It would be wonderful if that could happen worldwide. But first
let's see if it's possible in choosing what to build at ground zero.</TE>

<HD>Napoleon Was Sent Into Exile on St. Helena ... Wasn't He?</HD>
<DH>'The Emperor's New Clothes' puts a clever twist on history,
with Ian Holm portraying the deposed leader and his impostor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The clever and delightful "The Emperor's New Clothes" proposes that
it was not Napoleon who died on St. Helena on May 5, 1821, but rather
a look-alike impostor.</LD>
<LD>   In deftly bringing the Simon Leys novel "The Death of Napoleon" to
the screen, director Alan Taylor and his writers persuade us to
consider the possibility that the deposed emperor's supporters
managed to deliver to St. Helena a double for Napoleon, one lowly
Eugene Lenormand, who arrives on the island on the same cargo ship
that will transport Napoleon to Brest, from which he is to make his
way to Paris.</LD>
<LD>   Napoleon is not happy to assume Lenormand's identity during the
voyage, because it means he'll have to work as a deckhand. But after
six years in exile, he's confident that through sheer will "and the
love of the people," he will regain his lost empire.</LD>
<TE>   "What if" premises require viewers to suspend belief, but this
picture, with its wit and sophistication, makes it easy. No sooner
does a loyal Napoleon aide remark that he looks the same now as in a
portrait painted years earlier than Napoleon complains about how old
Lenormand looks. Napoleon's vanity is amusingly revealed, for
Napoleon and his double are played by the same actor, the estimable
Ian Holm, for whom "The Emperor's New Clothes" represents a tour de
force.</TE>
<TE>   After an inevitably melancholy stopover in Waterloo, Napoleon
makes his way to Paris to the townhouse of a loyalist, Lt. Truchaut,
only to find him laid out in a coffin. The lieutenant's attractive
Dutch-born widow (Iben Hjejle), who has the curious nickname Pumpkin
and is facing bankruptcy, is none too enthusiastic about taking in
this middle-aged man with a commanding manner whose true identity is
unknown to her.</TE>
<TE>   A turning point soon arrives for the former emperor. He faces the
prospect of living the rest of his life as someone he's never been:
an ordinary man. He could salvage the deceased Truchaut's failing
greengrocery and win his widow's heart as well. But what of his dream
of imperial conquest, as unrealistic as it seems? And what of
Lenormand, carrying on in his place back on St. Helena?</TE>
<TE>   The film unfolds with an inspired flow of twists and turns that
holds promise for the one thing Napoleon did not count on: a
confrontation with himself and the military ambitions so costly to
France and its citizens.</TE>
<TE>   As Napoleon, Holm shows us a man of vaulting, though wounded, ego
whose pomposity can reach proportions of unintended hilarity, a
brilliant if flawed leader of men haunted by sorrow and defeats. Yet
he's resilient enough to begin a new life with a different identity,
provided he doesn't succumb to delusions of grandeur. Holm's Eugene,
in the meantime, amusingly takes to the role of Napoleon more fully
than his aides had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Hjejle's Pumpkin is a strong, warm woman whose husband not only
was off at war for much of their marriage but who also couldn't make
a go of civilian life. The film has a large and substantial
supporting cast, but Napoleon and Pumpkin dominate the action.</TE>
<TE>   "The Emperor's New Clothes" might not have gotten off the ground
if not for the cost-saving resourcefulness of distinguished veteran
production designer Andrea Chrisanti, who blended various authentic
period settings in and around Turin and other Italian and Maltese
locales, all of which have been photographed gloriously by Alessio
Gelsini Torresi.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Ballo's costumes have the look of authentic clothing,
realistically reflecting the characters' wide range in social status.
Rachel Portman's score, at once romantic, majestic and vital,
completes this beguiling film.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for brief language. Times guidelines: A knowledge
of history is helpful.</TE>

<HD>A Mother, 3 Daughters and the Nuances of Modern Life</HD>
<DH>Nicole Holofcener's rueful sensibility is the strength at
the center of her charming film about a mother and her daughters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lovely &amp; Amazing" is all but indescribable, and what a good thing
that is. Like the best of personal, independent cinema--terms that
too often provide cover for a multitude of sins--it is both
marvelously observed and completely individual. There is no film like
this film, and that is something you don't hear every day.</LD>
<LD>   "Lovely &amp; Amazing" is a product of the distinctive sensibility of
writer-director Nicole Holofcener, whose debut film, "Walking and
Talking," provided a similar experience. She has an exact eye and ear
for the way things are, a rueful sensitivity to how quietly
ridiculous our 21st century existence can be. Sort of savage but in a
quiet, unassuming way, it is a funny and charming film about some
painful situations.</LD>
<LD>   "Lovely &amp; Amazing" is set in today's Los Angeles, and, like Doug
Liman's "Swingers," it's so accurate about how people attempt
meaningful emotional connections in an uncaring world of
self-involvement, obtuseness and free-floating insecurity that it
ought to be put in a time capsule. But while "Swingers" focused on
men, "Lovely &amp; Amazing" introduces us to a family of women doing the
best they can to get along.</LD>
<TE>   The group's matriarch, Jane Marks (Brenda Blethyn), is concerned
enough about doing good in the world to have adopted an 8-year-old
African American girl named Annie (Raven Goodwin), whose birth mother
was a crack addict.</TE>
<TE>   But Jane is also someone who can spend an inordinate amount of
time and money covering her bed with so many designer pillows that
there's no room to sleep. Her main preoccupation these days is
impending liposuction, a cosmetic procedure she seems to agree to at
least in part because she has a crush on the handsome Dr. Crane
(Michael Nouri).</TE>
<TE>   Jane has a pair of birth daughters, self-absorbed in different
ways; between the two of them, they seem to have cornered the market
on neuroses. Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer) is introduced first, an
actress so insecure about her body that it's fitting we meet her in
agonies of awkwardness posing for a picture in Vogue in a very
revealing designer dress. "I don't feel quite like myself," she says,
to which the photographer replies, "Who does?"</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth, it turns out, is not getting much help in the support
department. Her agent's idea of personal service is giving her
secondhand presents (she calls it "re-gifting"), and her boyfriend,
Paul (James LeGros), is a nature journalist with the personality of a
bump on a log. It's not a surprise to discover that Elizabeth is such
an aggressive rescuer of stray dogs her place resembles an animal
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Given all this, one of the surprises of "Lovely &amp; Amazing" is that
Elizabeth is considerably more empathetic than her sister Michelle (a
letter-perfect Catherine Keener), a former homecoming queen with an
exaggerated sense of her own importance.</TE>
<TE>   Keener, who starred in Holofcener's "Walking and Talking," has
often played hard-edged individuals, but they're hardly ever as
exactly observed as Michelle, a provocative character who mainlines
so much aggrieved entitlement she has only a dim sense of how hollow
and futile her life has become.</TE>
<TE>   Introduced trying to sell her homemade miniature chairs to a
crafts store, Michelle is shocked to find a former junior high
classmate is now a pediatrician. When the woman reminds her that,
after all, "we are 36," Michelle's response--"we're not 36 36"--is
telling.</TE>
<TE>   Although the mother of a little girl, Michelle in her own mind
won't grow up, won't deal with her abysmal marriage to an uncaring
personal sound engineer ("he buys stereos for rich people"),
won't--or can't--differentiate between taking charge of a situation
and being hostile and bossy. Even the relationship she has with young
Annie, who shows signs of developing the same insecurities as her
sisters, plays like sibling rivalry despite their difference in age
and situation.</TE>
<TE>   Each woman faces difficulties during "Lovely &amp; Amazing," from
Michelle's experimenting with the working world to Elizabeth's need
to participate in a "chemistry read" with a major movie star (Dermot
Mulroney) to answer the burning question "Are you hot together?" An
immediate change in anyone's outlook is not this film's style, but
the potential for future corrections is there in a gentle, wistful
way.</TE>
<TE>   With a cast that includes some of the top actors working in
independent film, "Lovely &amp; Amazing" involves us because it is so
incisive, so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives. Many of
these characters are people we almost hate to love, but by
illuminating their humanity, this film doesn't give us a choice.</TE>

<HD>Discovery Agrees to Keep Credits Rolling on TV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Essentially completing its retreat from a plan that would have
eliminated credits from its telecasts, Discovery Networks U.S.
unveiled a second revision of its policy Thursday, agreeing to grant
producers the option of maintaining the status quo or shifting the
lion's share of credits to the start of programs.</LD>
<LD>   The Bethesda, Md.-based company--which operates several cable
networks, including its flagship Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal
Planet--alarmed program suppliers by holding a series of meetings
this spring to outline the proposed shift, citing research that
suggested scaling back end credits would result in better audience
flow from program to program and thus higher ratings.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery's "credit initiative" would have limited producers to a
five-second card identifying the production company and any mandatory
credits at the program's end, otherwise directing viewers to a Web
site where full credits would be available.</LD>
<TE>   The policy announced Thursday officially eliminates the Internet
option, with Discovery admitting the proposal "created a high level
of anxiety" within the production community that the company "could
not ignore."</TE>
<TE>   The alternative option now calls for credits to run during the
first 30 seconds of a program, with five-second cards at the end
thanking anyone else involved in the show along with the production
company logo.</TE>
<TE>   Discovery began back-pedaling from the idea of excising credits in
late April, after news of the initiative prompted criticism from the
International Documentary Assn. and the Academy of Television Arts &amp;
Sciences. At that point the network sought to craft a compromise,
saying producers would be allowed to choose between running credits
as they're displayed now or adopting the Web alternative.</TE>
<TE>   That still didn't sit well with documentary filmmakers and
Hollywood guilds, however, who organized to voice their concerns by
forming a group dubbed the Documentary Credits Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the exciting story is about people who were
disenfranchised and didn't have a cohesive voice coming together and
prevailing," said Michael Donaldson, an attorney and president of the
International Documentary Assn. who spearheaded the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps foremost, producers worried that Discovery's plan would
spread to other networks (although some are obligated to run credits
under existing guild contracts). At the outset, many were reluctant
to voice their complaints publicly because they feared alienating
Discovery, a significant buyer of documentary programs.</TE>
<TE>   John Ford, president of the content group for Discovery Networks
U.S., initially downplayed the idea that credits had any significance
to viewers, and suggested that they have already been sped up and
shoved to the side of the screen--as NBC does during its "Must-See
TV" lineup--making the discussed change less than revolutionary.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, some viewers say credits race by so quickly that they
can barely make them out. "I feel sorry for the poor performers who
don't get to see their names," said Harriette Smith, 65, who lives in
West Los Angeles. "I want to know who did what."</TE>
<TE>   Although some producers acknowledge that credits may signal
viewers to begin flipping around to other channels, producers and the
guilds have argued that credits are currency used by production
personnel to secure future work. In addition, they say, credits
inform viewers who is responsible for a program, with one likening
the no-credit policy to running newspaper articles without bylines.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Discovery's concessions, producers privately say they
anticipate contract terms will be altered and that the issue will
eventually resurface as programmers continue to explore methods to
discourage channel-surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson gave Discovery credit for being responsive to the
misgivings expressed, but conceded that the television market is so
competitive that programmers will be tempted by any approach with the
potential to boost ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "The chapter's closed; I don't think the book is," he said. "The
creative community has to be vigilant."</TE>

<LD>   Heart Surgery Puts Rose Out of Commission</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Rose, the PBS talk-show host and "60 Minutes II"
correspondent, was recovering Thursday from open-heart surgery to
repair a faulty valve two days before.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a congenital condition that he has had all his life,"
Yvette Vega, Rose's executive producer, told USA Today. After
consulting with doctors, he opted for surgery that is expected to
double his energy level, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's unclear how long Rose will be in the hospital, Vega
said she "wouldn't be surprised" if he was back on the air in a week.
She plans a mix of taped segments and perhaps a few guest hosts
during his absence.</TE>
<TE>   Couric-Coulter Sparks Fly on 'Today' Show</TE>
<TE>   It promised to be lively. An interview with commentator Ann
Coulter conducted by "Today" show co-anchor Katie Couric--a
journalist Coulter referred to in her new book as "the Eva Braun of
morning television."</TE>
<TE>   Promoting "Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right" on
Wednesday, Coulter soon found herself in a tiff. Though Couric said
she didn't "want to go tit for tat," she played hardball with her
guest.</TE>
<TE>   Coulter, confronted with the "Eva Braun" characterization,
reminded her that "affable" was part of the description. "Thanks.
That makes me feel better," Couric replied.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks also flew over Coulter's claim that Couric blamed the death
of gay college student Matthew Shepard on Christian evangelicals and
that Couric's interview with Ronald Reagan biographer Edmund Morris
testified to her liberal bias.</TE>
<TE>   Couric dredged up Coulter's proposal that the U.S. invade nations
harboring terrorists, killing their leaders and converting them to
Christianity--an idea, Couric reminded viewers, that got the
columnist fired from the National Review. Still, Coulter had the last
laugh. Her book jumped to No. 1 on Amazon.com that day, according to
Variety.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Cable Asks for CNN-Fox News Swap</TE>
<TE>   CNN recently sent Eason Jordan, a top executive, to Israel to
diffuse charges of pro-Arab bias and calls to remove the network from
the airwaves. But the fires are still simmering, it seems.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Hollywood Reporter, Israel's cable companies have
applied to the Council for Cable and Satellite Broadcasting for
permission to add the more favorably perceived CNN competitor Fox
News Channel to their lineups. Sources maintain they've also asked
that CNN and the BBC be dropped--a move some see as a negotiating
tactic to lower the rates.</TE>
<TE>   In what seems to be a response to Israeli pressure, CNN this week
is broadcasting a heavily promoted five-part series, "Victims of
Terror," presented from Israel by Wolf Blitzer. CNN spokesman Matthew
Furman counters that perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "The series is an outgrowth of the fact there were two
back-to-back suicide bombings last week in which dozens of Israelis
were killed and even more injured," Furman said Thursday. "It was
strictly a news judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Miss Cleo's Jamaican Roots Investigated</TE>
<TE>   After months of resisting interview requests from the state's
attorney's office, Miss Cleo--the so-called Jamaican psychic--fielded
questions in a Florida courtroom for more than two hours on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Trade Commission has accused Fort-Lauderdale-based
Access Resource Service of deceptive advertising, billing and
collection practices. The company allegedly charged $4.95 a minute
for the chance to speak to telephone solicitors posing as psychics,
billed people who didn't call, and sent threatening collection
letters.</TE>
<TE>   According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Miss Cleo (a.k.a.
Youree Harris) invoked her 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination when asked about a birth certificate that says she
was born in Los Angeles to American parents. She also hinted that her
signature accent was not always her style of speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Miss Cleo isn't backing down from her claims of spiritual powers,
however. She claimed that she saw the investigation coming a year
ago. She'll resume her testimony on July 9.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Thirty Years Later,</TE>
<TE>   the Doors Reunite</TE>
<TE>   The three surviving members of the Doors will reunite to join some
dates of a festival-style tour celebrating the 100th anniversary of
Harley-Davidson--their first public concerts since September 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The tour visits the California Speedway in Fontana Sept. 6-8, and
the reconstituted Doors--guitarist Robbie Krieger, keyboardist Ray
Manzarek and drummer John Densmore--will play the first night. Guest
singers will fill in for the late Jim Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   Other acts on the alternating bill include the Stone Temple
Pilots, Journey, Los Lobos, the Doobie Brothers, George Clinton,
Billy Idol, Earl Scruggs and Nickelback. Tickets are now on sale. The
tour kicks off in Atlanta July 19.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Billy Joel has checked out of Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan,
Conn., a substance abuse and psychiatric center he entered for
treatment June 14.... Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will
perform live July 30 for NBC's "Today" show.... Penelope Spheeris
will direct the story of the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten and the birth
of punk rock in 1970s England for Rhino Films and Panacea
Entertainment....</TE>
<TE>   South Coast Repertory theater will stage David Auburn's "Proof,"
winner of the 2001 Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize, from Jan. 9-Feb. 9.
Michael Bloom will direct the play, which had its Southern California
premiere in a touring production at the Wilshire Theatre....</TE>

<HD>L.A. Weekly's Yearly Music Awards Show Hits Its Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a tall order to encapsulate the city's diverse musical acts in
one night, but the L.A. Weekly Music Awards came close, offering a
revealing sampler of local artists while celebrating the cream of the
crop Wednesday at the Roxy.</LD>
<LD>   The smoothly executed invitation-only event turned out a small
crowd of nominees, presenters, voters and their guests. Rather than
alternating the award-giving with performances by such acts as Radar
Brothers and Deepsky, as was done to chaotic effect last year, this
time the winners were announced in the middle of the program, during
an hourlong segment hosted by Andy Prieboy, the local
singer-songwriter recently lauded for his Guns N' Roses-inspired
musical revue "White Trash Wins Lotto."</LD>
<LD>   Most of the awards were determined by the alternative newsweekly's
music writers, but this year the paper's readers also selected
honorees in several people's-choice categories. Hard-rock band My
Ruin, led by local veteran Tairrie B., was one such popular favorite,
and about half the crowd stayed late to witness its metal-flavored
sturm und drang.</LD>
<TE>   Among the evening's winners who performed brief sets were best new
artist Dengue Fever, a collaboration between adventurous brother
musicians Ethan and Zach Holtzman, their pals, and elegant vocalist
Chhom Nimol, who sang in Khmer. This cross-cultural hybrid of
Cambodian pop, soul, jazz, surf and rock had a movie-soundtrack
quality, and was definitely a uniquely L.A.-born style.</TE>
<TE>   Other honorees who played were longtime local darling Concrete
Blonde (rock band), expansive surf-meisters Double Naught Spy Car
(instrumental band), and the always-riveting Medusa and Feline
Science (tied with Shapeshifters for rap/hip-hop artist).</TE>
<TE>   In general, the awards made more sense this year, eschewing some
arguably logical but overly obvious choices (i.e., Beck) in favor of
spreading the appreciation around.</TE>
<TE>   Still, consensus within categories was often split, as shown by
ties between the Excessories and Weezer (pop-rock band); E and Stew
(rock-pop songwriter/composer); Nortec and Crystal Method (electronic
dance artist), and Lalo Schifrin and Leonard Stein (classical
ensemble/artist).</TE>
<TE>   Veterans had a good showing, with Etta James garnering the
pop-rock lifetime achievement award, Les McCann winning the jazz
eminence award, Bad Religion getting the punk/hard-core nod, and
Solomon Burke, taking honors for contemporary blues/R&amp;B artist.</TE>
<TE>   Other honorees were Queens of the Stone Age (hard-rock band);
James Carney (jazz artist); Dave Alvin (country); Quetzal
(salsa/Latin); W.A.C.O. (new genre/uncategorizable); Ozomatli (world
music/recombinant); Babu (DJ mixmeister); Tony Watson (DJ selector),
and the Monkey Man's show on Pirate Cat Radio (radio show).</TE>

<HD>A Jolt of the Modernist Spirit</HD>
<DH>Michael Maltzan's modest but intimate design for MoMA QNS
is a bracing expression of the main museum's initial revolutionary
mission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--When New York's Museum of Modern Art first opened its doors
on the 12th floor of a Fifth Avenue office building in 1929, it
marked the beginning of a bold adventure. Modern art was fresh and
vigorous, and the museum's brash founding director, Alfred Barr, had
a mission: to bring Modernism to a still semi-provincial America.
Seventy-three years later, Modernism is the language of the cultural
establishment, powerful as ever but no longer threatening.</LD>
<LD>   The new Museum of Modern Art in Queens, which opens to the public
Saturday, is a momentary return to that earlier revolutionary spirit.
The project is only temporary. It will function as MoMA's home while
construction continues on an $800-million expansion of the museum's
53rd Street campus in Manhattan. Museum officials expect to convert
it to storage space after the main campus reopens, sometime between
late 2004 and spring 2005. With a $2.5-million price tag and 25,000
square feet of exhibition space, MoMA QNS cannot compare in scale or
ambition with the main project--a refined glass-and-steel composition
by the Japanese Modernist Yoshio Taniguchi that will cover nearly a
city block.</LD>
<TE>   But the modesty of MoMA QNS is part of its appeal. Designed by Los
Angeles-based Michael Maltzan, the project is conceived as a
delicately drawn architectural narrative--a series of visual bread
crumbs that pulls visitors along an unfamiliar landscape, then
deposits them in a womb-like space packed with artistic treasures.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a museum that engenders a remarkable sense of
intimacy between art and viewer and acts as a pointed challenge to
the monumental museum projects that have become ubiquitous in the
past decade. In its populist spirit, it is closer to Los Angeles
projects like Frank Gehry's Geffen Contemporary--a gaping warehouse
space built in the ethnic enclave of Little Tokyo in 1983--than to
the typical, more refined Manhattan museum.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, many Manhattanites have already complained about
the site of the temporary MoMA. Twenty minutes from midtown, it seems
too far. Its location, a barren landscape of factories and
warehouses, seems too dirty.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, MoMA's choice was an inspired one. During the last two
decades, the skyrocketing cost of Manhattan real estate has
significantly altered the contours of the New York art world. While
downtown art dealers have relocated from the raw, unpolished lofts of
SoHo to grander digs in Chelsea, many artists have been forced to
flee Manhattan for the outer boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   In bringing MoMA to Queens, the museum was clearly seeking to
bring art closer to that emerging cultural nexus. With its brooding
industrial buildings, the low, horizontal urban landscape of Long
Island City is a soothing antidote to the rampant consumption and
mind-bending visual noise that is making the big city less palatable
to the creative community. The industrial shed, meanwhile, has been a
symbol of artistic production since the rise of Pop art and
Minimalism in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan's design shows a keen understanding of that context. Its
narrative structure is loosely divided into three acts. The first
begins on the No. 7 line from Manhattan. Arriving along the elevated
tracks, visitors first glimpse the museum via a series of fragmented
white letters painted on large black plywood boxes mounted on the
building's roof. As the train approaches the station, the forms seem
to slide into place until they spell out M-o-M-A, and then fragment
again as the train pulls to a stop.</TE>
<TE>   That visual game continues at street level, where a 150-foot bar
of fluorescent lights extends along the building's blue surface,
drawing visitors to the main entry. There the MoMA QNS logo appears
again, emblazoned over the facade and partially etched into its
sliding glass doors. When the doors open, the letters temporarily
break apart, echoing the rooftop forms.</TE>
<TE>   The overall effect is mesmerizing. Maltzan has created the
museum's identity out of almost nothing--some paint, some boxes, a
few fluorescent lamps. But these elements are delicately woven
through the city's existing texture. As they dissolve in and out of
view, they act as a subtle commentary on the museum's temporary
status.</TE>
<TE>   Act Two occurs in the museum's lobby, where the pace of that
narrative suddenly accelerates. Visitors first go up a short series
of shallow stairs, where a view opens up into the main galleries
through a narrow gap between two walls. The lobby then turns sharply
to the left, splitting into two parallel paths. A narrow flight of
stairs leads up to a cafe at mezzanine level; another path slips
along the base of the mezzanine, passing the coat-check area and
leading to the ticket counter in back.</TE>
<TE>   It is here that Maltzan's light touch and compositional prowess
are on full display--and the space is taut with energy. Along one
side, the gently curved form of the cafe rail extends toward the back
of the lobby, where it drops back down to follow the line of a ramp
that deposits visitors in front of the ticket counter. On the other
side, the path is framed by the cantilevered wall of the Project
Space gallery, whose form seems to crash through the space and loom
over the ticket counter in back. As these lines and forms converge,
the space seems to tighten around you, and the mind begins to release
outside distractions.</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan says the lobby's design was partly influenced by the 1939
New York World's Fair Pavilion designed by Finnish architect Alvar
Aalto. Like Aalto's, Maltzan's work has a humanist bent. His spaces
tend toward the fluid and tranquil, not the brash and aggressive. But
at MoMA QNS, Maltzan has discovered a new edginess. In many ways, the
lobby's design is closer in spirit to the work of the 1920s-era
Russian Constructivists, whose dynamic buildings were meant to
reflect the relentless forward motion of a revolutionary culture.
Like El Lissitzky's Suprematist "Prouns"--theoretical buildings that
floated in the atmosphere--Maltzan's cantilevered gallery lunges out
into space, a wedge pointed aggressively toward the future.</TE>
<TE>   The relentless sense of movement could easily have taken on the
aura of an assembly line--with armies of automatons marching to the
beat of the cultural drums. Maltzan avoids that kind of
claustrophobic effect with a subtle layering of imagery. Carefully
framed views open up from the lobby into the galleries. A video
camera projects an image of feet shuffling down a Manhattan street
onto the side of the Project Space. The floor of the gallery is
partially cut away so ticket buyers can peer up through a video
screen at visitors milling around inside.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to give the audience visual cues about what is coming
up--to break down the barrier between art and life, as if the
creative forces packed inside were leaking out into the everyday
world. But by splicing together a series of seemingly disconnected
images--art, video, architecture--Maltzan creates a cinematic effect,
one that imbues the space with a surprising sense of weightlessness.</TE>
<TE>   That progression only breaks down as visitors proceed to the final
act, the main exhibition space. Maltzan did not design these spaces,
and the transition between the lobby and the galleries is somewhat
abrupt. The route from the ticket counter slips along the back of the
Project Space gallery and then runs into a long partition. At that
point there is a slight hesitation before continuing in either of two
directions. More critical, however, the wall partitions run right up
to the ceiling, interrupting the sense of visual flow that is a
critical theme of the design.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the rooms are generously scaled, and they retain the
feeling of accessibility that is a hallmark of warehouse galleries.
Raw and unpolished, they allow the art to completely take over.
Picasso's 1907 "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" seems to pop off the wall.
The sensuality of a carved wood figure by Alberto Giacometti is so
palpable that you are tempted to caress its surface. The viewer's
relationship to these objects seems almost casual.</TE>
<TE>   However beautiful the new Taniguchi-designed MoMA turns out, it
will demand a different relationship between viewer and art. With
135,000 square feet of exhibition space, compared with MoMA QNS'
25,000, it will be an overwhelming experience, an endless enfilade
filled with great works and packed with gaping tourists. As such, it
is unlikely to evoke the feeling of private joy that one is capable
of in Queens.</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan seems to have intuitively understood this. And that sense
of partaking in a small, cherished moment is as true of his
architecture as it is of the art. It is in that sense that the design
is closest in spirit to Aalto's 1939 pavilion or Frederick Kiesler's
1925 "City in Space"--New York projects that were demolished within a
year of their construction but that continue to hold a mystical place
in the minds of architects.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, when MoMA QNS is gone, years from now, it will play a
similar role in the collective memory. As such, it is sure to boost
Maltzan's reputation as a fluent--and important--talent.</TE>

<HD>Humor on Currin's Palette Imparts Power to His Work</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comedy has been essential to drama and literature ever since people
started telling stories to one another. It's also an important
component of movies and television. But it has never played a major
role in the visual arts, especially in the Western tradition, which
often takes itself too seriously. If you limit yourself to the last
century, you'd be hard pressed to name a single painter whose oeuvre
is based in comedic principles.</LD>
<LD>   At 40, John Currin is well on his way to changing that. For the
last 10 years, the New York painter has been exhibiting domestically
scaled pictures that demonstrate the breadth and depth of his
talents--which are dazzling--and comedy's capacity to say something
significant about the strange times in which we live.</LD>
<LD>   A diabolical blend of sarcasm and sweetness suffuses Currin's
early works, which depict impossibly proportioned men and women in
illogical situations that make sense in spite of themselves. The
faithfully rendered yet weirdly exaggerated expressions on their
faces make it very hard to know whether they're dumb as stumps or
wise in some home-grown way. Cluelessness and insight are never far
apart in Currin's deliciously skewed pictures.</LD>
<TE>   Painted with greater sophistication, his recent works are less
wicked and more potent. At Regen Projects, four new oils on canvas
give fascinating form to a peculiarly middle-class sense of being
uncomfortable in one's body and unsure of the role one is supposed to
play in public.</TE>
<TE>   Adolescent awkwardness takes shape in the biggest painting, an
image of two naked boys who have caught so many fish there's almost
no room left in their little blue boat. Their muscular backs and
dimpled buttocks occupy most of the foreground. As they wrestle with
a rope and a net in which one is entangled, their arms, hands and
fingers form a serpentine spiral that makes your head spin with
erotic energy. Currin shows his manners by leaving the position of
the boys' legs to your imagination: Under the pile of slippery fish,
they must form a fleshy pretzel.</TE>
<TE>   In another painting, a gay couple strikes a pose typical to
small-town portrait photography. As one man uses the other as a
backrest, you can almost hear them say "cheese." But the fidgety
discomfort Currin captures in their rosy faces suggests that they
can't believe they're acting just like the people they once despised:
heterosexual couples whose lives are so comfortable they might as
well be advertisements.</TE>
<TE>   A third shows an effeminate man getting ready to go out for the
evening. Dressed in a velvety fur-lined coat, he holds his jaw shut,
smiles unconvincingly and makes an emphatic "Who me?" gesture with
his delicate hands. Although his body fills the entire canvas, you
can't help but feel that he's standing before a full-length mirror,
practicing postures and expressions to see if any make him look less
painfully self-conscious.</TE>
<TE>   His desire to please is as touching as his nervousness is
palpable. Currin's painting is heartbreaking because it's clear that
this man knows he's not fooling anyone, least of all himself. But the
prospect of almost certain failure doesn't stop him.</TE>
<TE>   That's what's amazing about all of Currin's paintings. Although
they call to mind a laundry list of historical precedents, including
Cranach, Tiepolo, Boucher, Fragonard, Courbet, Sargent and Eakins,
they get you to root for them as if they were underdogs. That's
profoundly American and a mark of Currin's originality.</TE>

<TE>   Price Purges Anxiety and Sets Libidos Free</TE>
<TE>   Surrealism linked sex and anxiety so inextricably that modern art
has not fully recovered from their coupling. The advertising industry
hasn't helped: Using sex to sell everything under the sun, it has
created a few generations of artists who are suspicious of all forms
of pleasure, especially ones that excite--and satisfy--erotic desire.</TE>
<TE>   At L.A. Louver Gallery, a gorgeous exhibition of 10 salacious
sculptures by Ken Price shows the 67-year-old artist to be a man with
mission: breaking up the relationship between sex and anxiety in
order to make the world safe for hedonism.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., hedonism has a bad name. It's ordinarily treated as a
mindless diversion that's better left to decadent playboys than
pursued by serious artists. But Price makes it the focus of his
abstract sculptures, which redeem hedonism from puritan
narrow-mindedness by taking viewers back to classical antiquity,
where philosophic contemplation and shameless pleasure were not
opposed to each other.</TE>
<TE>   As inspired by animated cartoons and California car culture,
Price's tabletop sculptures are covered with multicolored metallic
finishes that put many painters to shame. All inhabit a world in
which the libido has been set free. Your mind has to move nimbly to
keep up.</TE>
<TE>   The plump protrusions and inviting orifices in "Off Color,"
"Marmaduke" and "Plushous" simultaneously resemble buttocks, breasts,
legs, jowls, noses and more. Seamlessly fusing male and female forms,
they stimulate category-defying desires and make a virtue of
polymorphous perversity.</TE>
<TE>   "Gorilla Ed" and "Red Neck" are softball-size orbs from which five
or six fat fingers emerge. Some of these reach outward as if to
explore their surroundings, like the antennae of sea creatures.
Others curl back to rejoin the orb. Mocking the idea that art
provides disinterested pleasures, these hilarious pieces put
tongue-in-cheek onanism on display. They satisfy a lot more than
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The five remaining sculptures resemble lava landscapes beneath the
surfaces of which lie thinly veiled references to previous
masterpieces. "Toots" is a futuristic version of Rodin's "Burghers of
Calais." And Brancusi's fused figures haunt "Izaak," "Sourpuss" and
"Kabongy Balls." These links to art history are not the first thing
you notice about Price's wildly accessible art. Rather than
overshadowing it, they make it even sexier.</TE>

<TE>   Gallace's Paintings Pull You in for Close-Up View</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a world in which every blade of grass, grain of sand and
gust of wind is as riveting as a perfectly composed poem. That's the
world that takes shape in Maureen Gallace's page-size paintings of
blocky little buildings in the New England countryside. At Michael
Kohn Gallery, five new oils on panel fill a rear gallery with so much
to see and even more to think about that you find yourself wishing
the room were bigger.</TE>
<TE>   True to their size, Gallace's paintings are intimate. They draw
viewers in for one-on-one encounters. Up close, you savor the
brushwork--the delicate dabs, deliberate strokes and wet-on-wet
smears the New York painter uses to build her carefully wrought,
casually expansive pictures of an empty road, a red barn, a hilltop
house, a seaside cottage and a pair of sheds on the shore of a rocky
inlet.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Gallace painted on canvas, the weave of which gave
her images a knobby solidity. The smoothly sanded panels that form
the grounds of her new works allow for greater fluidity and airiness.
When you catch yourself staring at a single brush stroke and paying
attention to the paths traveled by individual hairs of the brush, you
know you're hooked.</TE>
<TE>   Gallace doesn't make a big fuss about such refined pleasures. She
lays them out for herself and ignores uninterested viewers. This sort
of leave-you-alone stoicism is refreshing, especially in contemporary
art, which tends to attract obnoxious proselytizers.</TE>
<TE>   She applies paint swiftly and decisively. Everything feels as if
it has been carefully mulled over and then done, matter-of-factly and
wholeheartedly. There's no room for regrets in her seemingly simple
works, which don't mess around with adjustments and compromises.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal-clear about what they are up to, Gallace's paintings do
not embody the process of thinking out loud--of trying ideas out,
getting some feedback and proceeding accordingly. On the contrary,
they're utterly resolved. Unlike most intimate art, which invites you
to enter the interior world of its maker, hers occupies the fully
visible world of shared social space. It holds up from all the way
across the gallery, whose walls prevent you from testing just how
powerful her little pictures are.</TE>

<TE>   Mullican's Vibrant Works Defy the Passage of Time</TE>
<TE>   At Grant Selwyn Fine Art, a terrific exhibition of paintings and
drawings by Lee Mullican (1919-1998) picks up where his last gallery
show left off: charting a chronological course through his estate,
still a treasure trove of little-known riches and secret delights.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a similar survey focused on works the Oklahoma-born
artist made in San Francisco between 1948 and 1957, after he was
discharged from the Army. As a soldier, Mullican drew topographical
maps from aerial photographs. His job influenced his art, which often
resembles bird's-eye views of fragmented landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   The current survey begins in 1957 and ends in 1963. It features
the first works Mullican made after moving to Los Angeles in 1961 to
teach at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   These paintings fall into two groups: large, roughly square
canvases painted in a narrow range of bright yellows and slightly
smaller orange ones whose wider range of tints includes burnt sienna,
dirty beige, earthy brown, smoky black and a few blazing yellow
highlights.</TE>
<TE>   They're among his most minimal works. But that doesn't mean
they're simple. To make each, Mullican first painted irregular
patterns in two or three similar shades. Their interlocked shapes
recall camouflage. He then dipped the edge of a palette knife into a
pool of thick paint and pressed it to the canvas. This basic gesture
left a little ridge of wet paint that dried to form a solid line.
When Mullican repeated it thousands of times, a shallow relief
resulted.</TE>
<TE>   Think of Morse code crossed with Braille. This gives you an idea
of the look and the feel of his abstract images, which, properly
speaking, have as much to do with printmaking as they do with
traditional painting.</TE>
<TE>   They're also sculptural, or interactive. Catching slivers of
ambient light and casting thin shadows, they create flickering fields
of oddly modulated color. Some anticipate the look of heat-sensitive
imaging. Most are right at home with some of the best art being made
today, in which futuristic digital imagery intermingles with such
old-fashioned materials as paint and canvas.</TE>
<TE>   A second gallery displays five medium-size paintings Mullican made
in 1957 and 1958. It's hard to believe they're that old. Their sorbet
palettes, whimsical compositions and slippery surface effects make
them look very today.</TE>

<HD>Hey! It's 'Arnold' Without the Charm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For all the Nickelodeon cable network animated shows that get the
big-screen treatment, there seems to be a requirement to enlarge not
only the characters' physical dimensions, but also the story lines
and landscapes. Pumping such muscle enhancers into these quirky
little TV shows carries great risk, although the process worked OK
for both "Rugrats" movies. Much of the charm of the "Hey Arnold!" TV
series comes from its fanciful, gently whimsical treatment of
down-to-earth matters, from peer pressure to class envy, from
political integrity to good manners and from cultural bonding to
unrequited love. The latter, as regular viewers will tell you in a
heartbeat, is manifested in Helga (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith),
a brash barracuda-in-training who secretly pines for the series'
dauntless, football-headed hero, Arnold (Spencer Klein).</LD>
<LD>   Playground gossip has it that Helga, who shields her infatuation
with a hostile smoke screen, finally confesses her love for Arnold,
who neither knows nor cares how she really feels. If that were all
that "Hey Arnold! The Movie" was about, then one could praise its
makers for maintaining the series' hip, cozy milieu.</LD>
<LD>   But once again, someone felt it necessary to raise the stakes and
the noise level of a TV show to justify its move to the movies.</LD>
<TE>   Arnold's chockablock, blue-collar neighborhood of ethnic
restaurants, makeshift playgrounds and eccentric geezers has been
targeted by a ruthless developer named Scheck (Paul Sorvino) for
razing and transformation into yet another blah-di-dah shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold rallies his kooky grandparents (Dan Castellaneta, Tress
MacNeille), best friend Gerald (Jamil Smith) and other neighborhood
stalwarts to do quixotic battle against the well-heeled,
well-connected Scheck. It's not enough--not even with Helga providing
covert action on their behalf. They need fancy spy gadgets from a
righteous mercenary babe named Bridget (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and
some "Speed"-style chases along a perilous highway.</TE>
<TE>   The movie references here, as in the "Rugrats" movies, are
cunning. The lines are reasonably clever and neatly delivered. The
cause is just. But there's something off-kilter about the mix. Maybe
it's because the animation retains its TV flatness while the story's
texture is gratuitously bulked up. If its makers had somehow expanded
the animation while stripping the concept to dry, witty elementals,
"Hey Arnold! The Movie" could have been much more than just another
TV knockoff.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for some thematic elements. Times guidelines: OK
for older preschoolers.</TE>

<HD>A Meltdown at Middle Age</HD>
<DH>With a dash of Allen and a twist of Pinter, Charles Busch
explores the neuroses that come with maturity in his witty 'Tale of
the Allergist's Wife.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Valerie Harper's eyes roll. Her eyebrows rise. She flings her hands
toward the ceiling. This is not the time or the place for subtlety.</LD>
<LD>   This is the Ahmanson Theatre stage, and Harper is playing Marjorie
in Charles Busch's "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife."</LD>
<LD>   Busch describes Marjorie in his stage directions: "She's in the
throes of an epic depression. It's not quiet depression but raging
frustration. She's a volcano that explodes, simmers down and then
explodes again."</LD>
<TE>   Did we mention that this play is primarily a comedy?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Busch believes that volatile Marjorie, her
more-altruistic-than-thou husband, Ira (Tony Roberts) and her
brutally candid little mother, Frieda (Shirl Bernheim) are hilarious.
For much of the evening, he's right.</TE>
<TE>   The play has a go-for-the-joke ethos that stops short of brilliant
revelations. Obsessive and neurotic New York Jews are not unfamiliar
targets of satire. Busch's subject matter doesn't venture beyond
Woody Allen territory.</TE>
<TE>   But Busch's theatricalization of this turf generates a comic
energy that has been found wanting in some of Allen's recent work.
Busch was previously known primarily for starring in drag in his own
campy parodies of genre movies. No one is in drag here, but elements
of that quasi-operatic performance style remain.</TE>
<TE>   Which is probably a good thing for Ahmanson audiences in
particular. Even in its minimum 1,600-seat capacity, the Ahmanson
would seem too big for a five-character comedy set in a living room.
I can't vouch for the experience from the seats in the back. But by
the standards of small comedies, the scale of the performances
inflates "Allergist's Wife" into a bigger show than you might
imagine.</TE>
<TE>   If the specter of a TV-scaled sitcom hovers around the edges of
"Allergist's Wife," Busch also tries to ward it off with an element
of unresolved mystery. He introduces Lee (Michele Lee), a childhood
friend of the title character. She temporarily transforms Marjorie's
life. Busch diligently restrains himself from spilling the beans on
what Lee's all about--something that most sitcom writers might feel
compelled to do. He even converts the enigma of Lee into something to
be mocked, referring to her as a "Rasputin," a "golem," a "sphinx."</TE>
<TE>   Busch has acknowledged that he was, in part, inspired by Harold
Pinter's "Old Times," in which a mysterious interloper unsettles a
long-standing marriage. It's almost as if he has skewered "Old Times"
in the same way that he mocked beach movies in "Psycho Beach Party."
But with a setting so familiar to connoisseurs of American comedy
(and without the drag elements, which take his work much deeper into
artifice), it's possible to enjoy "Allergist's Wife" without ever
having seen "Old Times"--or "Psycho Beach Party."</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie has found her life increasingly meaningless. She tried
volunteering for charity. She tells a story--distressing to her,
funny to us--about an unpleasant experience in that arena. Too bad
that Busch implausibly has her tell this story to her husband and
mother, who have probably heard every detail several times but betray
no impatience with yet another telling, rather than to her new and
eager friend Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Marjorie has been filling the empty spaces with heavy-duty
cultural offerings. But they haven't been able to soften the blow of
her therapist's death. They haven't prevented her from entering a
Disney store and impulsively breaking a few figurines.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Lee. Since their paths parted as children, Lee has
apparently gone on to a life that's as stimulating as Marjorie's is
deadening. Although she never found true love, Lee has been
everywhere, done everything, met just about every famous person of
the last four decades. And she appears truly interested in Marjorie.</TE>
<TE>   As the stylishly outfitted Lee, Michele Lee is a strikingly glossy
middle-aged emblem. She could be a cover subject for the new baby
boomer magazine, My Generation. Although we soon suspect that Lee
isn't everything she's cracked up to be, the cracks aren't obvious to
Marjorie, who's desperate for anything that might ameliorate her own
sense of perdu.</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie's husband and mother are more dubious about the newcomer.
But Roberts' Ira oozes such self-satisfaction over his own heroic
service on behalf of the downtrodden (he retired from private
practice and opened a free clinic) that he soon finds himself
succumbing to Lee's seductions as well. Frieda, who's perpetually
squabbling with her daughter--and discussing her bowel movements in
graphic detail--takes longer to come around, but she too has a weak
spot for Lee's sheen.</TE>
<TE>   Busch's characters speak with a touch of pretentiousness that adds
to the comedy. Even blunt old Frieda gets a big laugh by suddenly
using the word "agog," delivered beautifully by Bernheim. Roberts
gets his biggest laugh when, near the end, he is suddenly overcome
with such rage that he forgets to couch his words in their usual
high-toned veneer.</TE>
<TE>   Still, under the brisk direction of Lynne Meadow, it's Harper who
displays the starkest contrast between fierce manifestations of
violent emotion--some would say it's mugging, but that's OK in these
circumstances--and her highfalutin intellectual aspirations. Busch's
final scene is too ambiguous, but it wouldn't be surprising to learn
that Marjorie's next visit to the Disney store goes no better than
the first.</TE>

<LD>In the skewered footsteps of "Bat Boy!" and "Urinetown" comes "Once
Upon a Primetime," a Neurotic Young Urbanites premiere now playing
the Powerhouse Theatre in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Lauren Bowles and Lauren Cohn's libretto presents one Edna Crumb
(the memorable Jodi Harris), born minus vocal cords ("You've got a
bouncing baby mime!"), with network programming her only consolation.
After devilish Diablo Skeezix (the outre Christopher Shea) ensnares
Edna in a Faustian pact to obtain a voice, she embarks on a
television quest through Reagan-era sitcoms to retrieve her soul.</LD>
<LD>   At its best, this loopy spoof is deliciously twisted, with
directors Patrick Fischer and John Lange ready to exploit all satiric
avenues. The sharply executed, inventive designs reflect this,
especially Ilana Radin's TV-screen-dominated set, and so does the
endearing ensemble.</LD>
<TE>   Harris, suggesting Marlee Matlin and Susan Egan morphed, carries
the house from entrance onward with effortless charm. Shea is
hilariously over the top--Charles Busch as a George Grosz
drawing--and the surrounding players all attack multiple roles with
the unfettered glee of Harvard students in a Hasty Pudding lampoon.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, this reveals the show's principal shortcoming. The
amiably jejune book and score (music by Curtis Moore, lyrics by
Amanda Green) lack substantive identity, slighting the theme of
trusting one's inner voice in favor of ham-fisted parody. Still, if
"Once Upon a Primetime" seems more cabaret than integrated musical,
it provides considerable merriment regardless.</TE>

<TE>   Inner Beauty the Topic of Sluggish 'Fat Chance'</TE>
<TE>   A couple of feel-good sayings--beauty is in the eye of the
beholder; it's what's inside that counts--have been cobbled together
in what seems a sincere attempt at humor as well as poignancy in "Fat
Chance."</TE>
<TE>   But too little of either quality comes through in the sluggishly
paced production that Blue Sphere Alliance gives this unfocused,
static story.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Brochu's early-'90s play predates his work on the musical "The
Last Session" with songwriter Steve Schalchlin. Both shows deal with
the power of friendship and the surprises that can lurk beneath a
person's appearance, but that's where the resemblance ends.</TE>
<TE>   "Fat Chance" visits the Philadelphia home of sculptor Matisse
Salinger (Ann Partrich). Self-conscious about her weight, she hasn't
ventured outside the house in months, causing her gallery-owner
mother (Peggy Mannix) and her longtime housekeeper and friend
(Masequa Myers, substituting for Jonelle Allen) to become concerned.
A resolution seems to present itself when a stalled car brings a
handsome stranger (Michael Lightsey) to the door. He stays to become
Matisse's model and, perhaps, more.</TE>
<TE>   Partrich is believable as a woman who has been damaged by life and
uses an ironic sense of humor to keep anyone from getting close
enough to hurt her again. Lightsey brings a sly sexiness to his role,
as well as an endearing desire to be appreciated for more than his
pretty body.</TE>
<TE>   But at a recent performance, long pauses and a general sense of
hesitancy bogged down Anthony Barnao's staging, which drew attention
to the weaknesses in Brochu's talky, pop-psychology-spouting script.</TE>
<TE>   Nudity alert: It's part of the show, but used artfully and
discreetly.</TE>

<TE>   Morality, Compromises in WWII-Era Italy</TE>
<TE>   Ravaged by poverty, corruption and oppression, the moral quagmire
of World War II-era Naples is a fitting backdrop for Italian
playwright Eduardo deFilippo's "Napoli Milionaria," a cautionary tale
about the tests of character a family faces in its struggle for
survival.</TE>
<TE>   In a lavish staging by Deborah LaVine for the Road Theatre
Company, skillful performances by Sam Anderson and Suanne Spoke bring
timeless resonance to DeFilippo's fascination with the best and worst
in human nature. With even bare necessities hard to come by under the
Mussolini regime, Spoke's fiercely ambitious matriarch, Donna Amalia,
supports her family by dealing in black market commodities. Her more
genial, easygoing husband Gennaro (Anderson) goes along with her
scams, reaching a farcical peak of passivity when pretending to be a
corpse to keep the police from finding the contraband stashed in his
"deathbed."</TE>
<TE>   Penned in an era less constricted by cast budgets, DeFilippo's
meandering first act establishes a broad social tableau inhabited by
the family's many acquaintances, only a fraction of which figure
prominently in the ensuing action. The household and even the
neighboring street life are rendered with breathtaking detail in
another of Desma Murphy's space-defying sets, which continue to put
larger, better-resourced venues to shame. Amid the gently humorous
portrayals of eccentric personalities, a particularly well-staged,
seat-rattling re-creation of an air raid injects a sobering reminder
of the ongoing war.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, keeping track of a bewildering array of characters
without a clear direction to the story is a tough challenge. Some
accents as authentic as canned spaghetti cause further distractions.</TE>
<TE>   Following the intermission, however, the piece finds its focus and
dramatic footing when Gennaro, separated from the family (by a plot
device) for more than a year, returns home to find a very different
state of affairs. Amalia's smuggling business has continued to
thrive, even under the Allied occupation. No longer able to
rationalize their illegal pursuits in the name of survival, the
morally compromised clan has a hard time accepting criticism from
Gennaro's insightful voice of conscience. It takes an act of supreme
nobility from one of the victims (K.C. Marsh) of Amalia's
exploitation to rekindle their sense of social responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   An old-fashioned morality tale, to be sure, but one that still
connects through hard-hitting performances.</TE>

<HD>Three Tenors in Traditional World Cup Performance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Very few soccer players make it to four World Cups. The Three Tenors
did.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing the tradition they started in Rome on the eve of the
1990 tournament final, Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose
Carreras gathered Thursday night for what was billed as "The Three
Tenors Last Concert in Japan 2002."</LD>
<LD>   Whether this was the last Three Tenors concert ever, or just the
final one in Japan, remains unclear; there are no current plans for
further concerts. But to answer the biggest question first, yes, the
fat man sang.</LD>
<TE>   Pavarotti said earlier this week that he intends to retire on Oct.
12, 2005, his 70th birthday. Last month, he canceled his last two
scheduled appearances at the Metropolitan Opera, leading the New York
Post to run a front-page banner headline: "Fat Man Won't Sing."</TE>
<TE>   His only performance since then had been the May 28 "Pavarotti &amp;
Friends" annual charity concert in Modena, Italy, where he was
reported to have sounded hoarse during a pop duet with Andrea
Bocelli.</TE>
<TE>   Singing Thursday before a large backdrop of Mount Fuji, Pavarotti
was in as decent voice as he has been lately. He performed three
arias: "Recondita armonia" from Puccini's "Tosca," Leoncavallo's
"Mattinata" and "Nessun dorma" from Puccini's "Turandot," which
became his signature tune when it was used as the theme for the 1990
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The program was much the same as the previous 28 Three Tenors
concerts, with Domingo singing Sorozabal's "No puede ser," and "E
lucevan le stelle" from "Tosca," and Carreras performing "Lamento di
Federico" from Cilea's "L'Arlesiana."</TE>
<TE>   They also joined together to perform the Beatles' "Yesterday."</TE>

<HD>In 'Notorious C.H.O.,' the Joke Is on Us</HD>
<DH>Margaret Cho's comedy embraces the audience, looking at the
absurd humor in our hang-ups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Margaret Cho has become a one-woman comic army in the war against
puritanical shame about sex, the body and its functions. Her weapons
are a wildly imaginative sense of humor and the courage to be
absolutely uninhibited.</LD>
<LD>   Like the great Moms Mabley before her, Cho has discovered that she
can get away with saying just about anything if it is said with
honesty and a perfect sense of timing, along with hilarious, dead-on
facial expressions. As with Cho's first concert film, "I'm the One
That I Want," producer-director-editor Lorene Machado has again kept
everything simple and direct, focused on Cho but embracing the
audience the way Cho does herself.</LD>
<LD>   Cho has always had a larger purpose in mind than getting laughs
for raunchy stories. Before the curtain goes up on "Notorious C.H.O."
at Seattle's Paramount Theater, where her latest one-woman show was
filmed, she tells us in her dressing room that she wants to provide
her audiences with "a way of belonging, of feeling validated." She
succeeds so resoundingly because her humor is so liberating and so
inclusive, inviting us to see the absurd humor in our hang-ups and
about who we are. Cho is a pretty, smart and courageous American
woman of Korean descent who developed the gift of a liberating
self-empowerment. The rich diversity of her audiences attest to her
wide-ranging appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Cho, who grew up in San Francisco, tells us how she always wanted
to be a performer, but as an Asian American initially felt the best
she could hope for was a chance to be "an extra in 'MASH.' " As she
grew older and set her sights higher, she was told by an agent that
"an Asian can never be successful in entertainment." It was at this
point, she tells us, that she drew inspiration from her high school
pals--a pair of fearless drag-queen lovers who set an example for her
in the courage to be oneself. No wonder Cho embraces and has been
embraced by the gay, lesbian and transgendered community; gay life
and gay humor provide her with a rich and provocative perspective in
dealing with the comic vicissitudes of being a very open-minded
straight woman.</TE>
<TE>   The outrageous vagaries of sex and the workings of the human body
and psyche, male and female, straight and gay, make up a great deal
of the show. Cho understands that sex is politics, that sexual
freedom presupposes the notion of a free society, and she therefore
doesn't have to preach but merely attack prudery with all the
seemingly limitless wit at her command. She also has some hard-won
observations on negative body images, and no Cho show would be
complete without her loving spoofs of her mother. (Cho's elegant
parents, seen briefly, clearly have learned to appreciate their
daughter's outlaw humor.)</TE>
<TE>   "Notorious C.H.O." matches its engaging prologue with an equally
winning epilogue in which Cho mingles with audience members after the
show as they leave the theater. Since the warm feelings her gay and
lesbian fans express toward her are not surprising, it is touching to
see a tall, handsome young man gently embrace her and say, "Straight
guys love you too."</TE>
<TE>   Unrated: Times guidelines. Exceedingly blunt language and sexual
humor.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a clue for TV mystery writers everywhere: As you approach the
plot's big payoff, viewers' enjoyment level tends to head south as
the need for extended explanations goes up.</LD>
<LD>   And when the quick-fix denouement involves invoking the dreaded
"Swiss bank account" gambit, particularly in a movie aimed at the
Disney Channel set, you can almost hear the air going out of the
balloon.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the plight of tonight's "Get a Clue" (8 p.m.), a movie
that displays style to spare bursting out of the starting gate only
to stumble at the finish line, tripped up by the wild tangle of
awkwardly knotted loose ends.</LD>
<TE>   Lindsay Lohan (from 1998's "The Parent Trap") is perfectly
charming as Lexy, the precocious 13-year-old daughter of a well-to-do
Manhattan couple. She could be the younger sister of Alicia
Silverstone's bubbly style-slave character from the 1995 movie
"Clueless," only with an extra helping of brains and ambition.</TE>
<TE>   Lexy aspires to follow in the footsteps of her father, a
high-ranking reporter with the New York Times. And when a gossippy
piece she has written about two of her teachers at the exclusive prep
school she attends makes it into a small rival newspaper's junior
journalism section, it appears she's on her way.</TE>
<TE>   But when one of the teachers disappears the next day, the story
gets murky, and Lexy and her school-paper friends set out to unravel
the mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Would parents really allow a 13-year-old to wander the streets and
subways of New York City on such a quest? Well, Dad appears too busy
to take much notice, and Mom is out of the picture after announcing
that she's leaving on a business trip in the opening scene.</TE>
<TE>   Folks, get a clue.</TE>

<HD>Sandler's 'Mr. Deeds': The Movie That's Hardly There</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It must be great fun to be a pal of Adam Sandler's. Being a member of
his audience is considerably less of a treat.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Deeds," Sandler's latest film, was put on paper by Tim
Herlihy, said to be the star's college roommate, who's written or
co-written six of his other films. Another college pal, Jack
Giarraputo, has been a producer each time, Perry Andelin Blake has
done all the production design, actor-associate producer Allen Covert
is in almost everything, and even director Steven Brill has acted in
three Sandler films as well as finding time to direct the noxious
"Little Nicky." How cozy for all involved, but what about us?</LD>
<LD>   Sandler and his cohorts must have a great time together after all
these years, maybe too much so. Didn't anyone take a break from
swimming in good feelings ("It's like working with family, it's the
best possible of situations," the director gushingly told Daily
Variety) to notice how little "Mr. Deeds" has to offer.</LD>
<TE>   For what's most interesting about this new film is how lacking it
is in any of the things, from humor to emotion to halfway decent
acting, we might go to a movie for. There's not even enough here to
get mad at. Rather, it's more dispiriting than anything else to see
how little a film can offer and still get made if a star who commands
a paying audience decides to make it his own.</TE>
<TE>   This "Mr. Deeds" is loosely inspired by the Frank Capra-Robert
Riskin-Gary Cooper 1936 classic, "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town." Although
what's left of the original's populism and celebration of small-town
values feels distinctly half-hearted, the plot does let Sandler
return to his warm and cuddly "Wedding Singer" persona.</TE>
<TE>   Before we meet the aw-shucks Deeds--he avoids using his given name
of Longfellow and doesn't want anyone calling him mister--we share
the last moments on Earth of Preston Blake (Harve Presnell), the
irascible 82-year-old billionaire who meets his end while leading an
unwise assault on Mt. Everest.</TE>
<TE>   Blake owned 49% of Blake Media, worth $40 billion (inflation has
raised that from the $20 million of the original), and the company's
oily executive Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher) is determined to find
Blake's only living relative and bend him to his will.</TE>
<TE>   That would be Deeds, a greeting-card poet manque who owns a
pizzeria in Mandrake Falls, N.H., but dreams of making that big sale
to Hallmark.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he hugs everyone in sight ("handshakes are for
strangers"), says things like "I'm wicked sorry about last night" and
provides great fun for what must be an entertainment-starved town by
reading his verses aloud.</TE>
<TE>   The plot takes Deeds to Manhattan, where he falls into the
clutches of Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder), a producer for tabloid TV's
"Inside Access." She pretends to be a school nurse from the Midwest
to gain Deeds' trust for her own venal aims, but soon finds herself
fatally attracted to someone she calls, in the film's determinedly
pedestrian dialogue, "a good-hearted guy who doesn't share our sense
of ironic detachment."</TE>
<TE>   This notion could be entertaining--it certainly was in the
original--but that doesn't happen here. For one thing, the film's
pacing and direction are so lackadaisical that nominal professionals
like Steve Buscemi and John Turturro make as little impact as
non-pros like John McEnroe and the Rev. Al</TE>
<TE>   Sharpton.</TE>
<TE>   That lack of energy seems to have infected Sandler as well. He
seems barely there as Longfellow Deeds, disengaged from a role that
only seems to interest him when, in moments that would be classified
as psychotic in a more coherent film, he departs from his pose of
decency to deliver any number of savage beatings to people who step
out of line. They certainly don't make sweet and lovable guys the way
they used to.</TE>
<TE>   They don't seem to be making parts for Ryder the way they used to
either. While Sandler showed in Paul Thomas Anderson's forthcoming
"Punch-Drunk Love" that he's capable of expanding his range, this
gifted actress seems to be contracting hers. Not only is this the
kind of cookie-cutter part that would have been unimaginable for
Ryder a few years ago, she seems completely lost in it. Truly this is
a performance of which the less said the better.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true for "Mr. Deeds." It's a film that isn't there, 91
minutes of celluloid without a movie. The question the nasty
executive asks an underling--"Is this a joke to you?"--could, with a
change of inflection, be more profitably asked of the film as a
whole.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13 for language, including sexual references, and
some rear nudity. Times guidelines: some moments of crassness and
unexpectedly nasty.</TE>

<HD>Washington-Portrait Tour Plays Vegas</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>America's first president has arrived in Las Vegas in time to
celebrate the nation's birthday.</LD>
<LD>   A full-body portrait of George Washington is making its second
stop in an eight-city tour as a reminder to Americans that he defined
the U.S. presidency, said Marc Pachter, director of the National
Portrait Gallery, which launched the national three-year tour over
Presidents Day weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The 1796 painting by Gilbert Stuart, who also painted the portrait
used on the dollar bill, shows Washington in the final year of his
second term. It depicts his final appearance before Congress, three
years before his death.</LD>
<TE>   The portrait, which came from its first stop in Houston, opens to
the public Saturday in time for July 4 celebrations. It remains at
the Las Vegas Art Museum through Oct. 27 before traveling to Los
Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, Little Rock, Ark., and
New York City. The tour also features educational programs about
Washington; organizers have launched a Web site (www.npg.si.edu)
about the portrait.</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Outside City Hall, around the sidewalk stage, things get crazy early
on. Kids cram the streets, tens of thousands crowding every inch of
pavement for blocks. Onstage, there is Big Tigger, from BET's "Tha
Bassment," pleading, "Please do not push. You've got to take a baby
step back. Please help us help y'all." Not that the pleading does any
good.</LD>
<LD>   There are gaggles of girls, drunk on heat and hormones and the
prospect of seeing a favorite rap star: Jay-Z. P. Diddy. LL Cool J.
Common. Noreaga. RZA from Wu-Tang Clan. So they shove and push, and
heave and squeeze, until the barricades come crashing down.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, they're here to protest school budget cuts, but on this
first Tuesday in June, at least, the vibe is more rap concert than
City Hall demonstration.</LD>
<TE>   Big Cap is on the turntable. Tigger's on the mike. A hundred or so
of New York's finest are on alert. Jumbotrons dot the street.
"Backstage"--a squared-off cordon of concrete--hip-hop's hottest,
from Rah Digga to Foxy Brown, to Chuck D and Erykah Badu, to Rev. Run
and Raekwon, are snaking through the crush of fans, teachers, City
Council members, union reps, activists and wannabes hell-bent on
snaring a record deal. They're here, as Noreaga puts it, "to support
the cause." And because rap mogul Russell Simmons of Def Jam Records,
the rally organizer, asked them to be here.</TE>
<TE>   This is what hip-hop, approaching its 30th year, looks like as it
comes of age politically. Flush with cash and the power of rap's
international appeal to young people, some in the hip-hop community
are starting to imagine the possibilities inherent in lassoing the
energy of millions of record-buying fans.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, activism and hip-hop have always danced together.
They've been partners ever since rap's earliest beginnings in the
Bronx, when Afrika Bambaataa and his Universal Zulu Nation abandoned
gangbanging for rapping and grass-roots organizing in the 1970s. But
Simmons' rally in Manhattan reflects a ratcheting-up of an investment
in the three Ps: politics, philanthropy and protest. It's even got a
nickname: raptivism.</TE>
<TE>   On the electoral front, spoken-word artist and school
administrator Ras Baraka just completed his third run for office in
Newark, N.J.; City Council contender George Martinez, a.k.a. Rithm,
says he's the first MC to run for elected office in New York; and
self-proclaimed "hip-hop minister" Conrad Muhammad, formerly of the
Nation of Islam, is mulling over challenging Rep. Charles Rangel
(D-N.Y.)--on the Republican ticket.</TE>
<TE>   On the philanthropy side, there's Simmons, whose newly formed
Hip-Hop Summit Action Network funds literacy programs, arts education
and political candidates. And then there are Mos Def and Talib Kweli,
outspoken artist-activists who organized other rappers to produce
"Hip-Hop for Respect," a maxi-single decrying police brutality;
proceeds benefited a nonprofit organization that encourages
entertainers to play leadership roles.</TE>
<TE>   P. Diddy founded Daddy's House, a charity that provides money to
underprivileged children in Harlem for computer camps and trips to
Africa. In Los Angeles last month, Boots Riley of the Coup,
Blackilicious, Dilated Peoples, Mystic, spoken-word artist Saul
Williams and Ozomatli performed for free in "Not in Our Name," the
first large-scale benefit concert to protest the Bush
administration's war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Not the hip-hop you usually see on your TV screen. Where's the
music that embraces the glamorous life, the live-now-I-got-mine
attitude found in countless hits, and in flashy videos where
hoochie-mamas bounce their backsides and Busta Rhymes exhorts, "Pass
the Courvoisier"? Therein are the two faces of hip-hop. While Busta
extols a brand of cognac, Nas is declining a lucrative deal with
Coors beer because he says he doesn't want to peddle alcohol to
African Americans. The "conscious" side of hip-hop is what prompted
Public Enemy frontman Chuck D to dub rap the "CNN of the ghetto" in
the late '80s, the side where political, social and cultural issues
are hashed out in verse.</TE>
<TE>   Some see it as a war for the soul of hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network will launch a
literacy program as part of a joint effort with Def Jam Records and
the Urban League. The group will also work with the NAACP to relaunch
Rap the Vote. Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy and LL Cool J have already
taped public service announcements encouraging young people to
register to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons describes himself as "very, very committed. We did the
Hip-Hop Summit and made a lot of promises, we are mentoring kids, we
do have a think tank, we do have a Def Jam literacy program, and it's
not easy."</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed to forming an alliance with those organizations
that young people felt connected with.... People have been
disconnected from the civil rights movement and we're working really
hard to connect those dots."</TE>
<TE>   As others already know and Simmons seems to be learning,
connecting the dots isn't an easy task. Though there were probably
historic alliances outside City Hall that day--hip-hop and organized
labor--not even all the troops seemed clear about the mission.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the rally, Jay-Z took to the airwaves, urging kids to
participate. But when asked what role he saw entertainers like
himself playing in politics, he shrugged and threw up his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just Jay-Z," he drawled.</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean he doesn't think rappers should play politics?</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't say that," he sputtered. "Don't start something."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, raptivism may be more the promise of something new
rather than its fulfillment.</TE>

<LD>Speaking Up for Valenti</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Lively chatter lured guests down the hall, a corridor accented by
a Picasso vase, a Lichtenstein and dozens of pre-Columbian artifacts,
into a living room crowded with household names. There were fresh
white orchids and plump garden roses in crystal vases everywhere.
Kirk Douglas greeted newcomers with: "I'm the host, you have to say
hello to me!" He opened his arms to everyone who came through. In one
corner, Charlton Heston chatted with Lew Wasserman's widow, Edie
Wasserman. Richard Crenna and Barbara Sinatra stood nearby. A moment
later, Suzanne Pleshette walked in with a joke. "My husband and I are
separated," she said. "I'm here and he's still at the door."</LD>
<TE>   Near the Toulouse-Lautrecs, Maria Shriver chatted up guest of
honor Jack Valenti. It was Tuesday night at the Beverly Hills home of
Douglas and wife Anne, who held the evening party to celebrate the
new and updated paperback edition of Valenti's 1982 hardcover: "Speak
Up With Confidence: How to Prepare, Learn, and Deliver Effective
Speeches" (Hyperion). From 1963 to 1966, Valenti was in charge of
President Lyndon B. Johnson's speeches. (He resigned from that post
for his current position as president of the Motion Picture Assn. of
America.)</TE>
<TE>   One anecdote in the book details a November 1963 incident of stage
fright suffered by famous orator John F. Kennedy at a dinner for a
longtime congressman.</TE>
<TE>   "When he started speaking, I could not help watching his right
hand. It was trembling, rapidly, ceaselessly," Valenti writes.</TE>
<TE>   In the book's final chapter, Valenti offers grades for public
speaking to 12 American presidents. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the
highest mark, an A-plus, and Valenti called him "the greatest of all
American presidents." Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy
also made Valenti's honor roll. Richard Nixon earned the lowest, a D
for being the "least believable to the public ... a plastic man." And
George W. Bush got a B-plus--for being "a quick learner."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Partying to Save the Children</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Brentwood, at Arianna Huffington's, Cheryl Saban was signing
copies of her new book, "50 Ways to Save Our Children" (Harper
Trophy). On an Empire table nearby, a collection of embossed cards
bearing factoids about children living in poverty lay spread out
under a couple of wine glasses.</TE>
<TE>   On the lobby staircase, Nation contributor and LA Weekly
editor-at-large Marc Cooper whispered into Richard Riordan's ear,
while champagne socialists and billionaires (including Haim Saban)
milled around below.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief presentation by Cheryl Saban in the library, a group
gathered near the piano decorated with a framed photo of Huffington
and Bill Maher. Riordan, a veritable one-man band, hugged, air-kissed
and delivered zippy one-liners. He told a very involved joke, with
himself as a Job-like character asking for God's help to understand
women. He was still joking when he said that he had hired Cooper for
the paper he plans to launch. (Cooper, standing nearby, was eager to
point out that it really was a joke.)</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Graham, another Riordan pal, came over for a hug. She
asked Riordan about the paper. He was talking to a number of people,
including William Dean Singleton (chief executive of MediaNews Group
Inc.), he told her.</TE>
<TE>   Graham--whose own involvement with the media includes work for
Vanity Fair and the Herald Examiner and a marriage to William Graham,
Katharine Graham's son--traded stories with Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, he is in such a good shape," Graham said about Riordan,
72, who still plays basketball and goes on extended annual bicycle
tours with such people as Tina Brown and Harold Evans, Barry Diller
and Diane Sawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Graham told Riordan that her true love was newspapers. The former
mayor shared his thoughts on the business: "I'm going to steal all
the sex ads from the LA Weekly," he said.</TE>

<LD>   Israelis, Palestinians and the</LD>
<LD>   Struggle for a Promised Land</LD>
<TE>   By Anton La Guardia</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Dunne/St. Martins</TE>
<TE>   408 pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "War Without End" is a thorough, dispassionate look at the history
and the contemporary, complex realities of the struggle between the
Israelis and the Palestinians for that piece of land at the
Mediterranean's eastern shore now divided between the state of Israel
and the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Anton La Guardia, former Middle East correspondent for the Daily
Telegraph of London and now its diplomatic editor, is clear about
what he thinks should happen. He believes, as do many in the world,
that the Palestinians should have a recognized state of their own.</TE>
<TE>   "Only the promise of internationally recognized statehood for the
Palestinians," La Guardia writes, "and of lasting peace for Israelis
with guarantees of no further Palestinian claims against the Jewish
state" will be strong enough to bring about a compromise and an end
to conflict. That would be best accomplished, he argues, through
secret meetings between Yasser Arafat and Ariel Sharon, both leaders
with a long history of apparent intransigence. That widely shared
analysis, however, may have been derailed by President Bush's
continued support for Sharon and his call for new Palestinian
leadership before their state can be established.</TE>
<TE>   As always in the Middle East, partisans will find much to object
to in La Guardia's survey. Some Israelis will resent his clumsy
characterization of Israel as "a Jewish dagger in the heart of the
Arab world." Some Arabs will be offended by his unrelenting portrait
of Arafat as a slippery, untrustworthy leader.</TE>
<TE>   La Guardia accepts the national myths of neither side, but he does
give them weight, for they help to explain the passionate feelings,
and hence the actions, of each combatant. Although La Guardia
characterizes the Balfour Declaration of 1917, in which Britain
promised the Jews a national home in the Palestine mandate that
Britain held, as an act of traditional imperialism, he recognizes
that the subsequent Holocaust and Israel's recognition by the United
Nations stamp Israel with its legal and moral right to exist.</TE>
<TE>   But La Guardia also foresees the day when the U.N. will validate
the Palestinians' suffering and dispossession with a state of their
own.</TE>
<TE>   He notes that "the Palestinians see themselves not, like the
Israelis, as a nation of extraordinary fighters, but as a nation of
martyrs," and he quotes Arabic poetry extolling the glorious deaths
of Islamic martyrs.</TE>

<LD>Most Endangered Places</LD>
<LD>   When you think of the word "endangered," what ideas come to your
mind? Many people think of endangered wild animals, such as tigers.
Do you know that buildings and places with a lot of history can be
endangered too? Once they are gone, they can never be replaced.</LD>
<LD>   We can learn a lot by studying old buildings and places. They
connect us to the past and to people who lived before us. The designs
and details of these places make our world more interesting and fun
to look at.</LD>
<TE>   The National Trust for Historic Preservation is a special
organization that works hard to protect endangered buildings and
places across America. Every year the National Trust chooses 11
endangered places in the country to help protect. This year, one of
the endangered places on its list is land in Southern California near
the Colorado River. This land has been sacred to the Quechan Indians
for thousands of years. The site contains pottery shards, petroglyphs
and ancient rock sculptures. It is still used by the Quechan for very
important religious ceremonies. This place is endangered because some
people want to dig a gold mine there.</TE>

<HD>Columnists' Daughters Carry On the Feud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second-generation feud between the daughters of long-embattled twin
advice columnists Ann Landers and Dear Abby heated up Thursday night
as Landers' daughter castigated her cousin--who now writes Dear
Abby--as a hypocrite for penning a mushy goodbye to her "Dear Aunt
Eppie" this week and for criticizing Landers' decision to keep her
fatal illness a secret.</LD>
<LD>   Margo Howard, daughter of Eppie Lederer, a.k.a. Ann Landers, who
died Saturday in Chicago at age 83, told "The CBS Evening News With
Dan Rather" that, although in the "Dear Eppie" letter Jeanne Phillips
quoted her late aunt as having praised her as talented and "doing a
wonderful job" with the Abby column, "my mother had told me and her
inner circle that she thought the column was quite subpar."</LD>
<LD>   While the letter that ran earlier this week in some newspapers as
the "Dear Abby" column showered love and admiration upon Lederer,
Howard said she'd heard only last fall that Phillips was bad-mouthing
Lederer as "old-fashioned" and telling features editors that she, as
Abby, was the future of advice columns.</LD>
<TE>   Beyond that, Howard told CBS, she was highly offended by Phillips'
comments in a Wednesday appearance on "Live With Larry King," in
which Phillips called Lederer's decision to keep secret her terminal
cancer "a tragedy," an ill-advised decision to protect her image.
"Despicable and in extremely poor taste," Howard said of the
comments.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview Thursday from her Cambridge, Mass., home,
Howard pooh-poohed the letter as "self-serving and loopy. They really
had no relationship. My mother was very kind to everyone, [but] she
thought Jeanne had her limitations." Howard suggested that Phillips'
letter, and her Larry King appearance, were ploys on Phillips' part
to call attention to herself and to "Dear Abby," now that the Ann
Landers column will cease to exist at the end of July. (Creators
Syndicate will offer in its place Annie's Mailbox, to be written by
two longtime Ann Landers aides, and with Howard's blessing).
Phillips' syndicate offered the "Dear Aunt Eppie" letter free to all
media, not only to paying "Dear Abby" clients.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Phillips would not comment Thursday, but Universal Press
Syndicate, which distributes "Dear Abby," said that although Phillips
had rejected requests from several national TV shows, including
"Today," to discuss her aunt's death, she had committed to Larry King
before Lederer died and could not control the show's content or
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, said Howard, who accused Phillips of "flogging her grief
at my mother's death" in her own interests and of being "beneath
contempt" for making "publicity grabs."</TE>
<TE>   Howard said it is her intent to stop this second-generation feud
before it goes further but feels obligated to respond "until Jeanne
decides to shut up." She also suggested on her CBS appearance that
Phillips "cease and desist with any more appearances or written
material having to do with my mother, because anything further from
her could take her to places I don't think she wants to go."</TE>
<TE>   In her interview with The Times, Howard said her response is
intended to stop the bickering. If Phillips does carry on, Howard
observed, "she is more of a fool than I thought."</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned. Phillips told Larry King that her July 4 "Dear Abby"
column will be a birthday greeting to her mother and her late aunt,
who were born in Sioux City, Iowa, on July 4, 1918. Universal Press
Syndicate confirmed that the column would run--with an addendum
explaining that it was written before Lederer's death.</TE>

<HD>From One Atheist to Another: Chill</HD>
<DH>So a nonbeliever defeats 'under God' in the courtroom. How
intolerant. How ironic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm struggling with my atheism.</LD>
<LD>   I don't mean that I'm losing my belief in a random universe. I
mean it's getting harder to remain in a congregation in which the
membership--at least that part that grabs the headlines--skews toward
the sullen, cantankerous and litigious.</LD>
<LD>   This week's court ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance violates
the Constitution for its use of the phrase "under God" will no doubt
have many true believers crying, there "they" go again. The "they"
is, of course, me, in that I'd be a card-carrying atheist if "they"
bothered to issue one. But also not me in the sense that many of us
of no faith have the same reaction as most with faith to cases like
these: Lighten up; we live in a country in which a large majority
identifies itself as Christian.</LD>
<TE>   I can live with that.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the God-fearing public's view of us as a monolith,
atheists belong to many denominations. The branch that has been
lawsuit-happy now for decades is from what I call the evangelical
atheists.</TE>
<TE>   They are intolerant, pushy and self-righteous. If it didn't
interfere with their busy schedule of dark moods and constant
brooding, they'd probably be handing out pamphlets and ringing
doorbells. In short, they embody all the qualities that sparked this
country's movement for religious tolerance and freedom in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   Tolerance is something the lawsuit's plaintiff, Michael A. Newdow,
could use a mighty dose of. He told reporters he doesn't believe in
God for the same reason he doesn't believe in Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   Evangelical atheists like Newdow delight in the Santa Claus
analogy. It's memorable, sounds clever and is incredibly insulting.
I've even heard the same assertion made with the Easter Bunny. In
part, the evangelicals make such callous remarks because they see
themselves as bringers of "Truth." And if a few feelings get hurt
along the way, they reason, that's the price for the liberating light
they bring.</TE>
<TE>   But I would never make such a comparison, nor would many atheists
I know. We wouldn't because it not only is bad manners and shows a
lack of intellectual humility, it's also grossly unfair. It's
empirically verifiable that there is no Santa Claus. The same cannot
be said of God.</TE>
<TE>   If you stuck a gun to my head (and, thankfully, I live in a
country where that would happen only to rid me of my wallet rather
than my religious beliefs), I would classify myself as an atheist. It
was not a decision I made quickly or lightly. My reasons can probably
be best summed up by paraphrasing the old Woody Allen joke: If there
is a God, he's a tremendous underachiever.</TE>
<TE>   But I cannot say with 100% certainty there is no God, and neither
can anyone else. The proposition that the world just spontaneously
came into being is preposterous. But so is the idea that a deity
created the universe and now sits in judgment of what we humans do
all day. Of course, if I'm wrong, I'm going to hell, as many
evangelical Christians have told me. But I believe what I believe.
Even we atheists must have faith.</TE>
<TE>   The other problem with evangelicals like Newdow is that while he's
so disrespectful about the beliefs of others, he insists his own be
treated with the utmost reverence. Don't even mention the word "God"
around him or he'll go to pieces. Society must accommodate him, not
the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   One of the many magnificent things about this country is that it
does strive to accommodate the individual, but in this case, it's
gone too far. There are no absolute rights, even with free speech.
(Try shouting "fire" in a crowded movie theater.)</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the question becomes what is reasonable. Is it reasonable in
a nation where the dominant culture believes in God to recite the
words "under God" in a classroom for a nonmandatory morning pledge?</TE>
<TE>   I think so. I grew up in the Bible Belt and said the pledge every
morning of elementary school and don't recall my delicate
sensibilities being trampled upon or my belief system altered by the
ritual. It's a harmless nod to the majority.</TE>
<TE>   Now with the Justice Department seeking a rehearing by the full
9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it seems likely Newdow's lawsuit will
be overturned, as it should be. But, in the meantime, guys like him
will continue to shape public perceptions of atheists.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a newspaperman and I know how the business works, but one
headline I'd love to see out of this affair is: "Well-Adjusted
Atheist Doesn't Object to 'God.' "</TE>

<DH>Believe it or not, Ripley's held a casting call, and no one

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where have all the weirdos gone?</LD>
<LD>   Although the Census Bureau doesn't keep statistics, the folks at
Ripley's Believe It or Not insist that California is second only to
Texas in the number of residents with bizarre talents and hobbies.</LD>
<LD>   For example, there's the Long Beach woman who turned laundry lint
into a life-size sculpture of John Wayne, the Covina man who
fashioned a statue of Jesus from 65,000 toothpicks and the Beverly
Hills matron whose body is 68% silicone, collagen or botox.</LD>
<TE>   OK, we made up the last one, but nobody would be surprised if it
were true, right? After all, California has a reputation for kooks
and freaks.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, when auditions were announced for the next edition of
"Ripley's Believe It or Not Encyclopedia of the Bizarre," Los Angeles
seemed a logical starting point.</TE>
<TE>   Except nobody showed up. Believe it or not!</TE>
<TE>   When Ripley archivist Edward Meyer held a casting call at the
Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore at the Grove shopping center in the Fairfax
District on Wednesday night, he faced a virtually empty house.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to say," sighed his publicist, Kim Dower. "We
thought we were going to have hundreds of people. Maybe L.A. has
become so bizarre that nobody realizes how bizarre they are anymore.
I mean, Melrose Avenue is a freak show. Tourists go there just to
gawk."</TE>
<TE>   The Ripley's crew had slightly better luck the night before in
Sherman Oaks. A girl from Encino showed up with the ability to blow
bubbles out of her eye. Of course, it's nothing Meyer hasn't seen
before in his 24 years with Ripley's. The current encyclopedia
includes a man who smoked a pipe through his eye. "Some people have a
duct that shouldn't be there," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   Another Ripley's wannabe at the Sherman Oaks tryout said he was
ambidextrous enough to play tennis with both hands at once. "He's
trying to get into the Guinness Book of Records and Ripley's," Meyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Grove, however, the freakiest thing was outside the
bookstore--a statue of a girl in pink shoes holding a statue of a
garden hose squirting real water into a statue of a dog. If the dog
had been real, its bladder would have absorbed enough liquid in 24
hours to irrigate every fire hydrant in the Western Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to liven things up, the publicist for the event had invited
two ringers: Dr. MegaVolt, a Santa Barbara man who electrocutes
himself, and Morris Katz, a New Yorker who is known as the world's
fastest painter. Katz, who has reportedly produced a quarter-billion
paintings during his career, is to art what McDonald's is to
hamburgers. When he and Meyer appeared on a local news show earlier
this week, the anchor told him to "get going" on his blank canvas.
Katz replied, "I'm almost finished."</TE>
<TE>   But Katz and Dr. MegaVolt didn't attend the Grove event.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, archivist Meyer had enough weird anecdotes and props
to entertain the handful of spectators at the event. Spread out on a
table before him were a two-headed chicken, a vest made of human
hair, miniature deer antlers carved from pecan shells, a size 37 shoe
worn by the world's tallest man (8 feet, 11 inches) and a tiny Adam
and Eve carved onto a piece of blackboard chalk by the same artist
who painted a replica of the "Mona Lisa" on the eye of a housefly.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer also told tales about a man who created a replica of
Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper" using 364 pieces of burned toast
and a guy who spent 12 years building a full-size Rolls-Royce with
matchsticks.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that becomes clear in this business is that people have
way too much time on their hands," Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean everyone in Ripley's is a nut case, he
added. For example, in Texas, Meyer met a guy called the Lizard Man,
who tattooed green scales over his entire body, inserted a ridge of
bones over his eyes and is considering grafting a tail onto his
backside.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, he is one of the strangest people I've ever
met," Meyer said. "But after sitting in a taxicab with him for 2 1/2
hours while stuck in traffic, I though he was perfectly normal and
very intelligent, like the guy next door."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the apparent dearth of new "talent" in Los Angeles, Meyer
predicted Ripley's would have no trouble filling its next
encyclopedia. "We get 200 e-mails a day from people with two-headed
cows, clothing made from hair and other oddities," he said. "People
looking for Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame come to Ripley's."</TE>
<TE>   Except in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe people here don't want to be in Ripley's Believe It
or Not," theorized Jan Lindstrom, community relations manager for Barnes
&amp; Noble. "Maybe they won't accept anything less than a film deal."</TE>

<HD>Graduation Day</HD>
<DH>Part 5. The story so far: Jenny's family is in the Monroe
High auditorium, ready to cheer for Kate and the other graduates.
They are unusually nervous and excited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVE BUNTING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kate is wiggling in her seat. She's tugging at her hair, which is
what she always does when she's nervous.</LD>
<LD>   "Kate Prentiss," the principal calls, and Kate walks, very
straight and formal, up the steps and across the platform.</LD>
<LD>   Our whole row erupts with noise, so much noise that people
actually turn to stare at us. It's a bit embarrassing, really. And
it's mostly the boy cousins, of course. I think Kate hears because
she looks up in our direction and smiles.</LD>
<TE>   I'm pretty proud of her. To be honest, she's an all-right sister,
most of the time. And then ... and then ...</TE>
<TE>   I sit forward on my seat. Grandpa clasps my hand.</TE>
<TE>   Our whole row is quiet.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I would like to present to you our oldest graduate," the
principal says. "Bernice Prentiss."</TE>
<TE>   Grandma goes up the steps and across the platform, so stately, so
erect, she could be the queen of England. Or maybe some famous model.
And of course she doesn't do anything wrong, like trip, or slip on
the steps. All the things she was nervous about. "I'm an old lady,"
she'd said to me. "I know you are," I'd told her. "That's what's so
great about you."</TE>
<TE>   The principal is talking again. "Mrs. Prentiss never had the
chance to attend high school when she was young. She had to stay home
to look after her mother and her four younger siblings. She has taken
classes all year, passed the exams with flying colors and is here
today, graduating with her granddaughter, Kate." He gives Grandma her
certificate.</TE>
<TE>   Grandpa is peering through the binocs, and his hands are shaking.
I squeeze his knee.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure your family is very proud of your achievement," Mr.
Carruthers says.</TE>
<TE>   Our row goes ballistic. I don't think it's very polite the way the
boy cousins are stamping their feet and shouting, "Yo! Grandma!" But
still.</TE>
<TE>   And so, later, Grandma gets to have her picture taken with the
graduating class of 2001. She flings her mortarboard up in the air
along with all the other grads. Balloons pop, horns blare.</TE>
<TE>   A photographer has come from the local paper, and he poses Grandma
and Kate together. I have a few jealous, piggy thoughts, but I tell
myself to get a grip.</TE>
<TE>   I never saw so much hugging and kissing in my entire life. I'm
even hugging people I don't know.</TE>
<TE>   What a day this has been.</TE>
<TE>   And there's still the chocolate cake.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eve Bunting's favorite graduation day was when her granddaughter
graduated from preschool. This story will be on The Times' Web site
at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>Are Women Indeed the Fairer Sex?</HD>
<DH>Prominent whistle-blowers give rise to speculation about
gender and ethics</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins. FBI agent Coleen Rowley. Former
FBI translator Sibel Edmonds.</LD>
<LD>   All were close to high-level wrongdoing, all willing to tell. In
the recent months of high-profile scandals, these whistle-blowers
have exposed misdeeds in some of the highest-stakes cases in the
country, and because all are women, many have speculated that gender
might have had something to do with it.</LD>
<LD>   There's no question that as women have come into positions of
power, they have gained unprecedented access to information about the
workings of their organizations. Some people believe that when they
come face to face with impropriety they react with an inherently
stronger moral and ethical sense than men do.</LD>
<TE>   Pointing to research by Harvard's Carol Gilligan showing
differences in how men and women look at ethical issues, UC Irvine
professor Judith Rosener says women have already brought a different
ethic to the workplace. "Women see things in a much bigger context
than do men," she said. In her e-book "Ways Women Lead" (Harvard
Business School, 2002), she observes that women tend to be more
interactive in their leadership. For instance, women consult a lot of
people when they make decisions; men consult a small coterie of
people.</TE>
<TE>   Women see the implications of their decisions, such as whom will
be hurt, in contrast to men, who tend to think about whether they
will make money or get caught, Rosener said. "Not that men are more
crooked. They don't think about implications in the same way." It's
no coincidence that the whistle-blowers exposing some of the most
significant examples of government incompetence and corporate greed
are women, says Anita Hill, the Brandeis University professor who, in
confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas,
charged him with sexual harassment. In an essay for the New York
Times, Hill observed that both Rowley and Watkins rose through the
ranks of male-dominated institutions to become insiders. At the same
time, they remained outsiders with outsider values, she suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Those "outside values," in contrast to the established corporate
culture, cause them to speak up, Hill reasoned, and their status
allowed them to be heard. What had been glossed over within became
front-page news.The memo Watkins wrote in August to then-Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay detailed improper accounting and management
practices that would later confirm the source of the biggest
corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agent Rowley's May letter to two U.S. senators and the staff
of a congressional committee described a "climate of fear" in the FBI
and named officials who had brushed aside warnings about suspected
terrorists before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   And just last week, it was revealed that Edmonds, hired as an a
FBI translator in Washington, D.C., after the Sept. 11 attacks, had
written letters to federal and congressional officials detailing her
suspicions about a linguist colleague. The colleague, she said,
belonged to the Middle Eastern organization whose taped conversations
she had been hired to translate for counterintelligence agents. In
addition, the colleague had had "unreported contacts" with a foreign
government official who was also a subject of surveillance. The FBI
confirmed those allegations, which, says Steven Kohn, Edmonds'
attorney, reveal flaws in the way the FBI is handling its
investigation of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Those who agree with Hill believe the tension between insider
status and outsider values is an ongoing phenomenon that will only
increase with the numbers of women in positions of authority. Others
say it's only incidental that women have blown the whistle in these
cases. "Ethics and integrity are not entirely the province of women,"
said Charmaine Yost, a board member of the Independent Women's Forum,
a conservative public policy organization. "Women do not have unique
standing as saints."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the women whistle-blowers might be making some men
nervous. Some fear a backlash against promoting women. "There is this
perception that if girls get into the good old boys' network, they
will tell tales out of school," said Marguerite Schaffer, president
of Executive Women of New Jersey. "It goes back to the schoolyard. If
we hang out with the boys, we might tell somebody what they're
doing."</TE>
<TE>   'Doing Their Job'</TE>
<TE>   In any given week, roughly 35 would-be whistle-blowers call the
National Whistleblower Center in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit
advocacy organization aiming to protect the rights of employee
whistle-blowers in both the private and public sectors. About half
the callers are women, and nearly 70% are government workers, said
Executive Director Kris Kolesnik, a former investigator for the U.S.
Senate Judiciary Committee and the Defense Department.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's "insider/outsider" theory makes sense, he said. "Women
aren't part of the good-old-boy system. What's important to them is
doing their job, as opposed to protecting their buddies. Guys tend to
be like pack animals. It's why male whistle-blowers tend to be
loners."</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, national experts have seen little correlation
between gender and the motivation for whistle-blowing. However,
retaliation against women is more personal, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "What you will find in all cases, no matter whether it's the FBI
or the Department of Defense, is the key defense in a whistle-blower
case is to attack the whistle-blower," said Kohn, who represented
Linda Tripp, among other whistle-blowers, both male and female. "When
they're looking at a female, they go straight for certain things:
marital status, children, and appearance. In a male, it's
performance-based, usually about promotability."</TE>
<TE>   In general, he said, the attacks are made by detractors in an
off-the-record way, he said, citing comments about Tripp, whose
evidence showed that President Clinton had lied about his affair with
Monica Lewinsky. Unlike her, Watkins and Rowley were reluctant
whistle-blowers. (Both declined to be interviewed. Edmonds was
unavailable for comment.) The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
investigating Enron came across Watkins' memos and she testified
under subpoena. Because many Enron executives have left the
organization or been fired, "she came away scot-free," Kolesnik said.
"But if they had more time, they would have done what every
organization does against a whistle-blower: mounted a case and done
the old rumor and innuendo routine on her."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, he said, Rowley, a lawyer in the Minneapolis field
office, wrote her letter after FBI headquarters had rejected her
office's search warrant request for a suspected terrorist and
indicated to a reporter that Rowley had concurred. "She wrote that
letter to set the record straight. She was concerned it was going to
snap back at her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, as a representative of co-workers in the field who
were also upset with headquarters, Rowley was no loner, he said. "She
had moral backing."</TE>
<TE>   Often portrayed as a "Midwestern mother of four," Rowley, 47, is a
veteran attorney who should not be mistaken for an
"insider/outsider," Kolesnik said. "She's a player."</TE>
<TE>   In response to Rowley's expressed worry over retaliation, FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller told senators that he would "absolutely"
make sure that Rowley is spared any reprisals. Mueller also wrote to
Rowley, assuring her that her job is not in jeopardy. Kohn said
whatever the agency's new thinking may be, it didn't apply to
Edmonds, who was fired after repeated warnings to keep quiet about
what she knew. "It's an indication of the real mentality on a
grass-roots level," he said. "There still is the culture of not
embarrassing the FBI and not reporting misconduct that has gotten the
bureau into so many problems."</TE>
<TE>   Women on the Rise</TE>
<TE>   As more women rise to power, Hill figures, women's opportunities
for whistle-blowing will increase, as will their chances to "shape
institutional standards from the top," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Some even suggest that big disasters might have been avoided if
there were more women at the top. to clean house. Those like
Schaffer, who say women are no more saintly than men, however, point
to Nancy Temple, the former legal counsel for Arthur Anderson whose
advice, a jury concluded, tacitly encouraged the company to obstruct
the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation into the Enron
collapse. The linguist Edmonds accused of having connections to a
group under surveillance is also a woman.</TE>
<TE>   Men need not fear that women colleagues will tell their secrets,
Schaffer said. The fact that the big whistle-blowers are women
doesn't mean that all women are whistle-blowers, said Schaffer, a
partner in her own law firm.</TE>
<TE>   "It just means that when women are confronted with a situation
that requires whistle-blowing, coming clean, they're not afraid to do
it," she said. "In high-ticket situations, women are inclined to see
the forest for the trees.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be women nurturers and women who inherently have a
higher ethical sense, and I'm not sure where that comes from. We do
ask more questions. If given the answers, we also understand black
and white and gray. And sometimes gray is OK in the business world,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with sweeping theories about what women do in
positions of power is that there still aren't enough women who have
risen high enough to test them, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yost, of the Independent Women's Forum, said that having children
intrinsically connects a woman like Rowley to "larger values." But
while it is important for women to bring their concerns as mothers
and women into the workplace, women do not have a corner on
integrity, she said.</TE>
<TE>   What Rowley and Watkins have done is culturally important and
should be commended, she said. "But I don't think the fact that
they're women will be of enduring significance. Isn't that what we're
going for anyway?"</TE>

<LD>There are icons and then there are icons.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Stewart's reputation may or may not survive accusations of
insider trading. But America's long cultural and literary romance
with its firefighters seems unscathed by recent allegations that a
forest service employee purposely set a Colorado wildfire and that
some New York firefighters engaged in looting during recovery efforts
at the World Trade Center site.</LD>
<LD>   David Halberstam's new book, "Fire House," is a bestseller, and
Joe McNally's heroically scaled photographic portraits of
firefighters who responded to the emergency on Sept. 11 are a hit of
the summer art season.</LD>
<TE>   And although charges of police misconduct or corruption routinely
trigger media and governmental investigations, allegations against
firefighters are usually reported as aberrations.</TE>
<TE>   None of this surprises Joseph Wambaugh, the onetime LAPD detective
sergeant turned bestselling writer.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the final sentence of his latest book, "The Fire Lover: A
True Story," is "Everyone loves a fireman."</TE>
<TE>   The different sentiments accorded police and firefighters "is
something I've thought and written about since the beginning of my
career," Wambaugh said. "In one of my first novels, 'The New
Centurions,' an older cop tells a rookie, 'If you want love, join the
fire department.' "</TE>
<TE>   "The Fire Lover," Wambaugh's first book in six years, is the story
of how former Glendale arson investigator and fire captain John
Leonard Orr ultimately was unmasked as the most prolific American
arsonist of the 20th century. Recreating the investigation into Orr's
crimes renewed Wambaugh's fascination with the perceptual divide
between police and firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "The book is full of allusions to differences," he said. "An
important source of mine was one of John Orr's best friends, an
investigator named Jim Allen, who'd worked with Orr on a lot of arson
fires. Jim has the extra advantage of having been a sheriff's deputy
early in his career, so he knows both sides of the coin.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Cops don't think like firefighters,' " Allen told Wambaugh, "
'and firefighters don't think like cops.' He told me if you're going
to understand an arson investigation for your book, you've got to
understand this basic difference: Firefighters are obedient team
players, who turn valves, pull levers, carry hoses and rescue things.
Cops make quick decisions, jump in people's faces and sometimes even
kill things."</TE>
<TE>   That insight was reinforced as Wambaugh got to know members of the
task force investigating Orr's case. They had been drawn from police
and fire departments across Los Angeles County. As they began to
realize that the serial arsonist "was somebody they knew personally,
John Leonard Orr, the firefighters were profoundly sad and
depressed," Wambaugh said. "One told me, 'I don't see any way we can
win in this situation.' Gradually, that sadness became outrage and
then, a burning determination to get the guy.</TE>
<TE>   "The cops were totally different. A couple uttered the usual
cliches about it being a sad situation, but I could see in their eyes
that they were profoundly excited. All they could think of was,
'We'll probably get on Geraldo with this one.' "</TE>
<TE>   To Wambaugh it is that hint of "darkness" that has made police
officers a rich source for fiction, while memorable depictions of
firefighters are rare.</TE>
<TE>   "Firefighters get a tremendous payoff from their work that cops
can never get--love. No cop can ever hope to get the kind of
unconditional love that the public and the press give firefighters.
Its value is beyond measure, and cops can forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   The public's ambivalence about police officers, said Wambaugh, "is
the reason there are so many more books about cops than there are
about firefighters. How many books can you write about unconditional
love? I mean, once you've written about your golden retriever, who
wants to read about him again?"</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   John Rechy is the author of 13 novels, including the classic "City
of Night." His biography, "Outlaw: the Lives and Careers of John
Rechy" by Charles Casillo, will be published in October. Rechy says:</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment, I'm working on my new novel, 'The Naked Cowboy:
His Life and Adventures.' Though it already has been purchased by
Grove/Atlantic Press and scheduled for publication, I'll keep
revising it right through the galley proof stage, as I always do.
Structurally, the book is loosely modeled on Henry Fielding's 'Tom
Jones' and has the same sort of picaresque narrative--impossible
situations and coincidences that are both exuberant and funny. "It
even has the subject and chapter headings that announce the action
and allow my own interjections. For me, it has been one of the most
entertaining books I've ever done.</TE>
<TE>   "The spirit and energy possible in these types of stories allows
you to twist things around in wonderful ways. The main character is
Lyle Clemens, a young cowboy who ends up at the Academy Awards
involved in an incredible scheme to kidnap a star. The story is set
in Texas, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. There's a scene at the Playboy
Mansion involving a peacock. "The columnist Liz Smith and Angelyne
are characters, and the hymn 'Amazing Grace' is central to the book.
Lyle becomes a revivalist and a star on the preaching circuit.
Somehow, in this book I discovered that loose freedom every writer
longs for."</TE>

<HD>Chasing Andy</HD>
<DH>Warhol's pioneering in art, fashion and other fields echoes
in the style makers he influenced</DH>

<LD>Pop! There goes Andy Warhol. Fashion types--designers, magazine
editors, window dressers and photographers--just can't seem to get
the Campbell's soup king off their minds. And why would they? In a
culture hopped up on celebrities, where "the democratization of
fashion" is a catch phrase, the original mix master of high and low,
mass and class, is a natural point of reference.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Sprouse pays homage to his former mentor in a photo spread
he shot for the July issue of Interview magazine. Using Warholian
repetition, it features items from Sprouse's Americaland collection
of graffiti-spattered tank tops, skateboards and swimsuits for
discount retailer Target.</LD>
<LD>   "If Andy were alive today, he'd totally be doing stuff for
Target," muses Sprouse, who is himself living the high-low legacy,
selling his signature scribble on $800 Louis Vuitton logo bags just
last spring and then mass marketing it at Target this summer (99
cents for a beach ball to $29.99 for a woman's swimsuit).</LD>
<TE>   "So much of what Warhol did has been assimilated into the culture.
The 'heroin chic' fashion photography of the 1990s looked like it
could be straight out of his film 'Trash,' " says Sprouse. "Warhol
even predicted with his Brillo boxes the kind of repetition which has
made Target's ads so popular."</TE>
<TE>   The current Warhol retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art
focuses mostly on his work as a painter. But he, like director,
author and artist Jean Cocteau, had a multifaceted career. Warhol was
also a photographer, a filmmaker, a window dresser, a fashion
designer and model, and the creator of two fashion-related cable TV
interview shows long before the Style network even existed.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol started out in New York as a commercial artist in the
1950s. He was an illustrator for several magazines, including Vogue
and Harper's Bazaar, and his enlargements of comic book images graced
window displays of department stores Bonwit Teller and I. Miller.
Unlike contemporaries Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, who both
designed windows under pseudonyms, Warhol was not ashamed to take
credit for what some might have deemed "low art."</TE>
<TE>   "He's the patron saint of window dressers," says Simon Doonan, who
put the windows of Barneys New York on the style map. "And the great
thing was that he wasn't so serious about being an artist, which is
why he was able to do windows.... There was no pomposity about his
achievements, which made it almost easier to enjoy them because they
weren't jammed down your throat."</TE>
<TE>   Warhol didn't value a painting over a TV show or a dress. "It's
that kind of freedom to cross what might be perceived as boundaries
into different creative endeavors that Warhol contributed," says
Margery King, who co-curated "The Warhol Look: Glamour, Style,
Fashion," an exhibition organized by the Andy Warhol Museum in
Pittsburgh in 1997 that traveled to several venues, though not to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Sprouse recalls his last night with Warhol, who died 15 years ago,
at a punk rock club on the West Side Highway in New York. "It was
July and super sweaty and hot, with a lot of slam-dancing going on,"
he remembers. "So, in between bands we would go out and sit on the
curb to cool off across from the river. A car full of kids drove by
and asked if he was Andy Warhol. We thought they were going to beat
us up, but instead they jumped out and asked him to draw a soup can.
Andy did it and they got a signed soup can."</TE>
<TE>   Sprouse and Doonan are just two of a generation of style
cognoscenti Warhol inspired. He hired Vogue magazine editor-at-large
Andre Leon Talley for his first fashion gig and encouraged celebrity
photographer Patrick McMullan to begin documenting nightlife, giving
him his first pocket camera. He also hosted the opening party for
Paraphernalia in 1966, the first store owned by fashion designer
Betsey Johnson, who still says, "Andy is in my blood." (Johnson
married a member of the band the Velvet Underground, which performed
at Paraphernalia, and Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick was one of her
models.)</TE>
<TE>   As for Talley, he had just moved to New York from Durham, N.C.,
when he walked into the offices of Interview magazine, without an
appointment and dressed in an Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche suit, to
ask for a job. "I feel indebted to him," says Talley, who was the
fashion editor there from 1974 to 1975 and is now Vogue
editor-in-chief Anna Wintour's right-hand man. "He gave me the
confidence to be who I was. And coming to New York from the South, I
had not been myself to that degree."</TE>
<TE>   McMullan got to know Warhol hanging out at Studio 54, the center
of disco culture in the 1970s. "I used to try to walk in with my 35mm
camera and Andy said, 'You can't bring that to a party. You need a
pocket camera. Because once you get inside, people don't care if you
take pictures, but if they see you at the door with a big camera,
they might not let you in.' " When the photographer told Warhol he
couldn't afford a pocket camera, he sent him one as a gift.</TE>
<TE>   McMullan began snapping pictures of New York's downtown nightlife
for Interview. Today, he still shoots parties for the magazine, as
well as for Vanity Fair and other publications, making his living off
the cult of celebrity he says Warhol helped to create.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol himself was an obsessive shutterbug who delighted in
photographing fashion shows and parties. "He was a silent observer
photographing, filming and recording everything," says fashion
designer Diane von Furstenberg, who saw him at least three times a
week at parties in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   He also surrounded himself with talented lens men. Fashion
photographer Richard Avedon was a documentarian of the Factory, and
he borrowed from the aesthetic there when he shot the controversial
cK Calvin Klein fragrance ads in 1990s, criticized for promoting
"heroin chic." Now-famous photographers Mario Testino, Bruce Weber,
David LaChapelle and Herb Ritts worked regularly for Interview, first
published in 1969 as an underground film magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a joke that he [Warhol] started it to get tickets to
the New York Film Festival," says Glenn O'Brien, who was
editor-in-chief until 1974. Interview morphed into a fanzine in the
1970s--an ink and paper version of one of Warhol's legendary parties
that included interviews with such characters as fashion designer
Halston, transvestite Candy Darling and model Iman.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, the Q&amp;A thing wasn't really a part of journalism,"
says O'Brien, now a filmmaker. "We turned it into an interesting
format, having celebs interview other celebs, or a group thing that
was several people having a conversation," he says, adding that he
believes the formula helped spawn People magazine, InStyle and other
celebrity interview-fueled titles popular today.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for all the disciplines and personalities Warhol
influenced, his silk-screens may indeed have had the most
far-reaching implications on the world of style. Like Sprouse's
graffiti, Warhol's fantastically colored images of Campbell's soup
cans, Coca-Cola bottles, flowers, Elvises, Maos and Marilyns have
become style icons--and commodities--in their own right.</TE>
<TE>   He knew the power of his own images when he incorporated Brillo
boxes into a dress and S&amp;H green stamps into a chic blazer in the
1960s. Then, in the late 1980s, perhaps inspired by Keith Haring's
Pop Shop, he began putting his images on T-shirts and tote bags and
collaborated with Sprouse to design a line of clothing based on his
"Camouflage" series of paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion designers such as Anna Sui and Vivienne Tam played with
Warhol's images during the artist's lifetime. Gianni Versace paid
homage to his Marilyns in a gown for his 1991 spring collection and
Donatella Versace used the "Flowers'' series in a print in this
year's spring line. (Plenty of licensees are cashing in too. Just
take a look at the lines to get into MOCA's gift shop on the
weekends.)</TE>
<TE>   "I adore Warhol," Donatella says. "I met him so many times with
Gianni. Two weeks before Warhol died, he came to Milan, and we joined
him for lunch. He asked for a special leather jacket, and we gave it
to him. What a revolutionary person. He changed everything."</TE>

<HD>NBC TV Expects Earnings to Rise 15%</HD>
<DH>Media: Parent GE forecasts profit to rise 25% at its
television stations but to be flat at its cable unit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC Television said Thursday that it expected pretax earnings to
climb 15% to $1.6 billion this year on the strength of its popular
prime-time shows, news programs and stronger advertising sales at
stations.</LD>
<LD>   NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., made its projections
to analysts in New York.</LD>
<LD>   GE expects profit at its company-owned TV stations to rise 25%
this year, from $550 million in 2001. The company owns 13 NBC
stations and acquired 12 Spanish-language stations in its
$2.7-billion purchase of Telemundo.</LD>
<TE>   The NBC News division, including "Nightly News With Tom Brokaw,"
"Today" and "Meet the Press," should record pretax earnings of $240
million to $260 million this year, executives told analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The weak link is the company's cable television division, in which
earnings are expected to be flat with 2001, at about $360 million for
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives said that although MSNBC had enjoyed a 17%
increase in viewership, it had not captured a large enough share of
the cable news market. They said MSNBC would shuffle its prime-time
schedule in July.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, which boasts such top-ranked shows as "Friends," "ER" and
"The West Wing," has the most stable schedule of any network.</TE>
<TE>   NBC is introducing five programs for the coming season, and Fox
Broadcasting is placing 10 new prime-time shows on the air. ABC is
introducing nine shows, and CBS will have seven.</TE>
<TE>   GE plans to shave costs by consolidating some sales and
news-gathering operations in cities with NBC and Telemundo stations.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects Telemundo's advertising revenue to grow this
year by more than 30%. The Spanish-language network has sold about
$225 million in commercial spots for the new season, up from $175
million sold in advance last year.</TE>
<TE>   Telemundo still commands less than a third of the Spanish-language
TV market, trailing Univision Communications Inc. of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares closed Thursday at $29.90, up 40 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Suit Against Blockbuster Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Judge sides with firm against three video
retailers, saying they failed to present sufficient evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Texas pulled the plug Thursday on a bitter
antitrust case that alleged that video giant Blockbuster
Entertainment and five Hollywood studios conspired to drive
independent video stores out of business.</LD>
<LD>   In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Edward Prado in San
Antonio sided with Blockbuster against the three independent video
retailers who sued, saying they failed to present sufficient evidence
in the 2-week-old trial.</LD>
<LD>   "After listening to everything they had, we didn't think it was
even necessary for us to put on a case," Blockbuster Chief Executive
John Antioco said.</LD>
<TE>   "Their evidence didn't support the allegations."</TE>
<TE>   The decision doesn't bode well for a similar case pending in Los
Angeles, and Antioco vowed to try to have that lawsuit thrown out as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' lawyer Chuck Dorr said the store owners dispute
Prado's ruling, but he stopped short of saying whether they would
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised. We were disappointed. We obviously don't
agree," Dorr said.</TE>
<TE>   At issue had been a revenue-sharing arrangement Blockbuster, part
of entertainment conglomerate Viacom Inc., forged with Hollywood
studios five years ago. The pact is widely credited with not only
revitalizing Blockbuster's video rental business, but also giving a
huge boost to studio video business as well.</TE>
<TE>   Blockbuster bought tapes at discounted rates of about $23 each
instead of the traditional price of more than $60 so its stores could
stock more copies for video customers who were dissatisfied because
the movies they wanted already been rented.</TE>
<TE>   Blockbuster then gave studios a cut of the revenue, saying that
the volume of new rentals would more than make up for the price
discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Blockbuster and its parent Viacom were accused of pressuring
studios into not offering similar deals to independents, something
both studios and Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone denied.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the key dispute concerned a format that is fast
becoming obsolete as video stores convert to lower-cost DVDs,
available for about $18 each. Two studios, Warner Bros. and
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., were not part of the case because they
settled for a reported $15 million combined.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining in the case were the video divisions of Walt Disney Co.,
Sony Pictures Entertainment, Viacom's Paramount Pictures, Vivendi
Universal and Fox Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Antioco said Blockbuster fought the suit because the company
believed it did nothing wrong, and didn't want any stain on the
turnaround it engineered.</TE>
<TE>   "Viacom, Sumner and I are very proud of what we've accomplished
over the last five years, and we didn't want any clouds over that,"
Antioco said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Viacom's Redstone, one of the most legally tenacious
entertainment moguls, who has been known to go to great lengths to
fight even the smallest of disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Redstone, whose autobiography is titled "A Passion for
Winning," told about 1,000 graduates at Northwestern's Kellogg School
of Management's commencement Saturday that "it's not about the
money--it's about winning" and "like it or not, winning is
everything."</TE>

<HD>University Affiliates IPA Closes Its Doors</HD>
<DH>Health care: Many patients have to find new doctors as the
network became the 11th in the state to fold this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>University Affiliates Medical Group IPA of Alhambra, which had 2,400
doctors treating 105,000 patients in Southern California, became the
11th California medical group to fold this year when it shut down
late Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   University Affiliates was the nation's first fully accredited
independent physicians association, originally established and
operated by the University of Southern California in 1995. IPAs are
physician-directed networks in which participating doctors enjoy the
benefits of a larger organization while controlling their own
practices. Administration was shifted from USC to the IPA board in
1998, but its final years were marked by financial struggle.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, some University Affiliates doctors said they had
patients who were being turned down for care.</LD>
<TE>   "This is really bad--I have patients that need X-rays but they are
being told that University Affiliates patients aren't being served
anymore," said Los Angeles area family doctor Herbert Rubin, who
treated about 500 patients through the IPA.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin added that some of his patients have been shifted to another
medical group he is affiliated with, but he doesn't know how many
will have to scramble to find other doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "My patients are afraid. They're concerned and I don't know what
to tell them. I don't know where these people are going to go," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesperson for the IPA said no patients would lose their
medical coverage.</TE>
<TE>   One large insurer, Blue Cross, was able to keep about half its
14,000 members who used University Affiliates with their doctors, but
the other half have been assigned new doctors.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to patients, Dr. Sam J.W. Romeo, University
Affiliates' president and chief executive, wrote: "The failure of
University Affiliates provides further evidence of the power and
profits-above-all orientation of the HMO industry in California,"
adding that insurers refused to negotiate higher payments for his
group even after an independent audit told him that the payments were
too low for his group to survive.</TE>
<TE>   The health plans said Romeo's IPA was poorly managed.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dole Food Co. said Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Kay
was leaving to pursue other interests.</LD>
<LD>   Dole, the largest producer of fresh fruit and vegetables in the
world, said it had named Richard Dahl to succeed Kay.</LD>
<LD>   Dahl left Pacific Century Financial Corp. and its Bank of Hawaii
as president in March to find a job that had business exposure to the
Asia-Pacific region, Pacific Century Financial said at the time.</LD>
<TE>   He joins Dole as it tries to cut costs by striking more favorable
contracts with suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Kay had joined Dole in 1999 from Universal Studios. Dole
spokeswoman Freya Maneki would not elaborate on why Kay is leaving.</TE>

<HD>Rate of Growth Revised to 6.1%</HD>
<DH>Economy: The first quarter's expansion is the fastest in
two years, exceeding forecasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy grew faster than expected at the beginning of this
year and the labor market is improving, government reports showed
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Boosted in part by the first increase in business spending for
equipment and computer software since the third quarter of 2000,
gross domestic product--the broadest measure of goods and services
produced within U.S. borders--grew at a revised 6.1% seasonally
adjusted annual rate during the first three months of this year.</LD>
<LD>   That was the fastest pace in more than two years and unexpectedly
higher than an earlier estimate of 5.6%, the Commerce Department said
in its final reading for the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Although it was not enough to reassure financial markets hit by
accounting scandals, the number added to evidence that the shallow
slump of last year was over.</TE>
<TE>   The labor market, usually the last to pick up in the wake of a
recession, now is showing signs of improvement with fewer workers
last week signing up for jobless benefits, according to a separate
report.</TE>
<TE>   New claims for state unemployment insurance benefits--a rough
guide to the pace of job layoffs-- dropped by 10,000 in the week
ended June 22 to a seasonally adjusted 388,000, the Labor Department
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth straight week that these jobless claims were
below the key 400,000 mark, a level viewed by economists as a sign of
a lackluster labor market.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Commerce Department's GDP report, consumer
spending, which fuels two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.3%
annual rate, up from the initial estimate of 3.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Business spending--which Federal Reserve officials regard as
crucial to sustainable economic expansion--declined during the first
three months of the year but not as sharply as previous estimates.
Business investment fell at a 6.2% annual rate, a smaller drop than
the previously estimated 8.2% decrease.</TE>
<TE>   In one bright light, spending on equipment and software was up
0.1%, the first gain since the third quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest surge in defense spending since 1967 also helped push
up GDP growth during the quarter.</TE>

<HD>3 Ex-Bankers Charged in Enron Deal</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ex-employees of a British bank are accused of wire
fraud in the first counts directly resulting from the energy trader's
collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the first criminal charges stemming directly from Enron Corp.'s
financial dealings, federal prosecutors Thursday accused three former
employees of a British bank of secretly investing in an Enron
partnership from which they earned more than $7 million in illicit
profits.</LD>
<LD>   In an affidavit filed in federal court in Houston, prosecutors
charged three former investment bankers at Greenwich NatWest with
wire fraud, alleging that theycheated their employer by recommending
that it sell its stake in an Enron partnership controlled by
then-Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow for $1
million--knowing it was worth much more.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after, Fastow transferred ownership rights to that stake
to the three men for $250,000. Weeks later, they sold their stake for
$7.3 million, the government said.</LD>
<TE>   Former prosecutors speculate that the government brought wire
fraud charges against Gary S. Mulgrew, Giles R.H. Darby and David J.
Bermingham as part of its larger probe of Fastow and other Enron
executives, including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former
President Jeffrey K. Skilling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that is going to be another segment in the continuing
saga of trying to get Andy Fastow and prosecute him in the most
effective way possible," said Stephen L. Meagher, a former U.S.
prosecutor who now practices with law firm Phillips &amp; Cohen in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy Fastow is going to be one of the crown jewels of the Enron
prosecution," Meagher said.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit contains transcripts of e-mails exchanged between
the former British bankers, which shed new light on the internal
workings of Enron's murky off-the-books partnerships. Enron used
these vehicles to conceal debt and liabilities, and Fastow and his
associates used them to make millions of dollars for themselves,
according to an Enron board investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of e-mails beginning Feb. 20, 2000, for example,
Bermingham told Mulgrew he would be "the first to be delighted if he
has found a way to lock it in and steal a large portion for himself,"
according to the affidavit, which said it appears that Bermingham was
referring to Fastow and a deal that would generate millions of
dollars in profit.</TE>
<TE>   Bermingham added: "We should be able to appeal to his greed,"
again referring to Fastow, according to the government.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow's attorney declined to comment and attorneys for
Bermingham, Darby and Mulgrew could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   The charges come less than two weeks after the government's court
victory over Arthur Andersen in which the accounting firm was
convicted of obstruction of justice in connection with its Enron
audit.</TE>
<TE>   Experts predicted after the Andersen verdict that prosecutors
would turn their full attention to pursuing Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   Outside observers believe that prosecutors are most interested in
building criminal cases against Fastow, who--according to the Enron
board investigation--masterminded many of Enron's most suspect
financial transactions.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Andersen conviction, Meagher said, making a
deal with the government--as former Andersen auditor David B. Duncan
did--might look attractive to potential defendants.</TE>
<TE>   John J. Fahy, a former U.S. prosecutor, said such a charge is "an
old prosecutor's trick" designed to elicit cooperation not only from
the defendants but also from Fastow and Michael Kopper, the Fastow
aide who ran some of the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "This is meant to send a message, especially to Kopper, but also
to Fastow, that we [the prosecutors] know what's going on, and if
you're smart you'll have your lawyers come in and talk to us," Fahy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mulgrew headed NatWest's structured finance group. Darby was an
energy-industry banker and Bermingham reported to Darby and Mulgrew.</TE>
<TE>   The financial dealings detailed in the complaint are centered on a
controversial Enron partnership known as LJM Cayman. Controlled by
Fastow, it is one of a handful of partnerships on which investigators
have focused most intently in their probe of Enron's historic
bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, LJM Cayman was used to limit Enron's risk in an
Internet company, Rhythms NetConnections Inc., through a complex
series of transactions involving Enron's own shares.</TE>
<TE>   But LJM Cayman has generated interest because it was one of the
partnerships from which Fastow himself reaped significant profit.</TE>
<TE>   LJM Cayman had two limited partners, Campsie Limited--established
by NatWest--and ERNB, established by Credit Suisse First Boston. Both
Campsie and ERNB were established in the Cayman Islands, and each
invested $7.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavit, the three men collaborated to take
control of NatWest's stake in Campsie, and apparently were able to
capitalize on uncertainty created by a hostile takeover of NatWest's
parent company, National Westminster Bank of Britain by Royal Bank of
Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   The document lays out a scheme in which the three men allegedly
worked in coordination with Fastow to gain ownership of an LJM
subsidiary, known as Swap Sub. It claims the men concealed their
effort from co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to Darby and Mulgrew, Bermingham wrote that he had
told another employee that their boss was "in the loop" about their
plan but the employee should keep quiet about the venture and "just
act dumb, please." In another instance, Darby told another NatWest
employee to not attend a sensitive meeting at which the venture would
be discussed. Darby told the employee not to worry because they were
"going to get rich," according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   The men significantly underplayed to their bosses the value of the
Swap Sub stake. NatWest subsequently agreed to sell the stake to a
Fastow-controlled entity for $1 million. An identical ownership
position owned by another investment bank was sold for $10 million,
according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks after acquiring the stake for $250,000, the bankers sold
their position for $7.3 million, the affidavit said.</TE>

<HD>GDP Report Ignites a Rally on Wall Street</HD>
<DH>Stocks: The Dow jumps 149.81 points after a seesawing day
as worries over WorldCom and GM are calmed by upbeat economic news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks raced to their biggest gains in almost two weeks Thursday, as
raw nerves about the WorldCom accounting scandal were soothed by a
government report that the economy grew faster in the first quarter
than previously thought.</LD>
<LD>   Investors snatched up beaten-down shares after weeks of selling
had put stocks at multiyear lows, allowing bulls to take firm control
of the market late in the session.</LD>
<LD>   But prices seesawed for much of the day after jitters about
corporate accounting problems were reignited by rumors of
irregularities at General Motors, the world's largest auto maker. GM
denied the rumors, but its stock, a Dow component, still fell $1.58
to $51.50.</LD>
<TE>   "The market was hit by this GM story--which appears to be a
fabrication by some short sellers--and we recovered that loss," said
Tim Anderson, stock trader with Salomon Smith Barney. "The market
will be in a tug of war here for a couple of days as we deal with the
end-of-quarter portfolio balancing." The second quarter ends today.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts warned that the market could continue to be at the mercy
of rumormongers, with investors nervous about the possibility of more
corporate accounting scandals--and mindful that the smart move in
recent months has been to sell such stocks as WorldCom, Adelphia
Communications and Global Crossing at the first hint of bad news.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the semiconductor sector carried technology stocks
higher, boosted after Lehman Bros. raised its rating on the group.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 149.81 points, or 1.6%, to
9,269.92. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 17.11
points, or 1.8%, to 990.64. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite rose
29.87 points, or 2.1%, to 1,459.20.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by more than 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange. Trading was heavy for the second straight day.</TE>
<TE>   The government said the economy raced ahead at its fastest clip in
more than two years in the first quarter, up from earlier estimates,
amid better-than-expected consumer spending and business investment.</TE>
<TE>   "These numbers support the view that the economy is on a recovery
path," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason
Wood Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders, including Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, led the
advance among blue chips, rebounding from declines Wednesday after
WorldCom said it misstated earnings and sparked concern it would
default on billions in debt. Citigroup gained $2.16 to $39.16, and
Morgan added $1.23 to $32.72.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields rose for the first time in three days on the
economic news and the stock market rally. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note rose to 4.82% from 4.74% Wednesday. The dollar
fell against the euro and the yen.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The S&amp;P chip equipment index gained 4.3% and the SOX
semiconductor index was up 3.1% after Lehman hiked its rating on
firms in the chip-making sector, including Micron Technology, up
$1.50 to $20.50, and Integrated Circuit Systems, up $2.24 to $20.24.</TE>
<TE>   * Top chip maker Motorola rose after it said it would cut 7,000
more jobs to reduce costs and that it expected to take charges of
about $3.5 billion but affirmed its forecasts for operating earnings
for the second quarter and full year. Shares rose 41 cents to $14.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Pfizer rose $1.75 to $36.75. The drug maker said it would
explore options, including the sale of two consumer product lines,
and set a $10-billion stock buyback.</TE>
<TE>   * Advertising companies fell on fears that WorldCom's accounting
scandal may dampen telecom advertising spending, although analysts
said no single U.S. advertiser had major exposure to the phone giant.
Interpublic Group fell $1.76 to $23.51, and Omnicom Group lost $4.51
to $44.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Hewitt Associates rose $4.50 to $23.50 in its first day of
trading on the NYSE. The manager of employee benefits sold 11.2
million shares at $19 each, raising $212 million in its initial
public offering.</TE>
<TE>   * Qwest Communications International, which was knocked lower
Wednesday on fears it could be caught up in troubles similar to
WorldCom's, snapped back sharply after saying it was cooperating with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Its shares rose 97 cents, or
54%, to $2.76.</TE>

<HD>Teamsters Join Port Labor Rally</HD>
<DH>Unions: Events to boost support are held from Wilmington to
Seattle. Both sides expect contract talks to continue past deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just four days before the contract between dockworkers and shippers
expires, the nation's most powerful transportation unions joined
forces Thursday in rallies held in port cities from Seattle to
Wilmington.</LD>
<LD>   The events aimed to focus support for the 10,500 International
Longshore and Warehouse Union workers under contract, who are trying
to achieve a resolution with the Pacific Maritime Assn. and avoid a
work stoppage that could damage the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   The contract expires Monday at 5 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, trade in the nation's West Coast ports amounted to $260
billion of cargo. A shutdown of those strategic centers of commerce
could cost the national economy up to $1 billion a day, according to
a UC Berkeley study.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides in the labor dispute acknowledged this week that talks
were expected to continue beyond the contract expiration, but neither
party is talking about a strike or union lockout.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the potential for even a limited disruption of port cargo
has shippers anxious. For companies that rely on the ports, the union
rallies are seen as potentially dangerous posturing, said some local
import-export brokers.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 dockworkers and their supporters attended the spirited
rally Thursday at the ILWU's dispatch hall in Wilmington. Dockworkers
there said they wanted only to protect their rights, benefits and
working conditions from being eroded by foreign-owned shipping lines.</TE>
<TE>   Gathered under the banner "Unity on the Waterfront" and joined by
a convoy of horn-blaring, Teamster-driven big rigs, labor leaders
drew loud applause by vowing to step up their organizing efforts and
make local ports "wall-to-wall union."</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to dismantle this union, and we're not going to
stand for it!" said Ramon Ponce De Leon, president of ILWU Local 13.
"And there are unions in Southern California and dockworkers around
the world who support us."</TE>
<TE>   At a rally in the Port of Oakland, ILWU President James Spinosa
was joined by Teamsters President James P. Hoffa. Hoffa's 1.4-million
member union has promised not to cross ILWU picket lines. The ILWU
has pledged to support the Teamster's drive to organize port
truckers, who get paid by the load, not by the hour.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, contract negotiations were said to have hung up
on health and welfare benefits. Negotiators were said to have begun
Thursday to address the thornier issue of technological improvements
called for by shippers to make the ports more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Dockworkers said the kind of automation and computerization being
promoted by shippers--including measures that could allow clerical
tasks to be performed at remote inland locations--could cost them
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you can perform work from the moon doesn't mean you
should move our work to a deepwater port in Utah," ILWU clerk
representative Tommy Harrison said sarcastically. "We're saying, use
us. Put the technology where it belongs, on the waterfront and under
union control."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Thursday, Pacific Maritime Assn. President Joe
Miniace said shippers had "guaranteed the union that no current
registered worker will lose his job as technology is implemented."</TE>
<TE>   As the saber rattling of the ILWU and the PMA intensifies,
businesses that depend on Pacific Rim markets were getting antsy
about possible disruptions in the flow of commerce at the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach, which make up the nation's busiest harbor
complex.</TE>
<TE>   High-volume, low-margin port businesses were pleading for
appeasement. Others were stockpiling imported goods and preparing to
reroute deliveries and shipments, if possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think either side should take a hard stand on anything
right now," said Guy Fox, executive vice president of Global
Transportation Services Inc. in Redondo Beach. "The U.S. economy is
barely getting back on its feet and can't afford disruptions."</TE>
<TE>   A local firm specializing in exporting wastepaper products to
Asian markets has started clearing all of its available floor space.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can't ship out, our warehouses will fill up in three days,"
said a spokesman for the firm, who declined to identify the company
for fear of antagonizing either side in the negotiations. "If the
ports shut down for longer than that, we'll have to haul product to
landfills. In any case, prices for it will collapse."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Nacht, dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC
Berkeley, agreed that the economic costs of a work stoppage at the
ports would be high and worsen quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "West Coast ports last year handled 7.7 million freight
containers, or 21,000 every day," he said. "Fourteen days of shutdown
would mean over 300,000 containers would not be going out or coming
in."</TE>
<TE>   West Coast docks suffered strikes in 1934, 1936-1937, 1948 and
1971, when dozens of incoming freighters were forced to anchor just
offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Ponce De Leon downplayed chances of a disruption.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's got to stop listening to groups that are saying
there's going to be a strike--we're not using that word," he said.</TE>
<TE>   PMA spokesman Jack Suite also said a strike or lockout was the
last thing the shippers wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "This contract negotiation is crucial to the nation's economy,"
Suite said.</TE>
<TE>   "What is important is to stay at the table, work through the
issues and emerge with a contract that positions the waterfront for
another 30 years of growth."</TE>

<HD>PricewaterhouseCoopers Agrees to Pay IRS Penalty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- PricewaterhouseCoopers, the largest accounting firm,
agreed Thursday to make a "substantial payment" to the Internal
Revenue Service for promoting abusive tax shelters and will tell the
tax collector about clients who used them.</LD>
<LD>   The firm, which didn't admit wrongdoing or legal liability, will
pay the undisclosed amount for advising clients on tax shelters since
1995.</LD>
<LD>   Pricewaterhouse also agreed to provide "certain client
information" and to work with the IRS on developing ways to ensure
compliance with rules on tax shelter registrations and lists of
investors using such shelters, the agency said.</LD>
<TE>   Pricewaterhouse declined to specify the size of the IRS payment.</TE>
<TE>   "In the context of PricewaterhouseCoopers, this is not
substantial," spokesman David Nestor said, declining to comment
further.</TE>
<TE>   The company has annual sales of about $9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time in a year that a tax shelter promoter
agreed to pay a penalty. In August, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to pay
a "substantial" fine for promoting a tax shelter in the 1980s and
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Nestor and IRS spokesman Bruce Friedland declined to describe the
tax advice the agency found objectionable.</TE>
<TE>   Pricewaterhouse said it agreed to resolve the case "after
considering the disruption that the receipt of broad-based summonses
currently being issued by the IRS to other tax advisors would cause
for our clients, the possibility of a protracted dispute with the
service and the hazards of potential litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "The costs of continuing to dispute these issues with the IRS far
exceed the costs of settlement," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Financial scandals at several corporations, including Enron Corp.
and WorldCom Inc. and involving accounting firm Arthur Andersen, have
left the accounting industry concerned about its standing with
investors and regulators.</TE>

<HD>Reaction to Pitt's Proposal Is Mixed</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A plan by government regulators to make top executives personally
certify the accuracy of their companies' financial reports wouldn't
eliminate accounting scandals, but it could keep chief executives of
troubled firms from claiming that bookkeeping was somebody else's
job, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom Inc.'s $3.9-billion earnings restatement this
week--allegedly one of the biggest accounting frauds in U.S.
history--prompted Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey
L. Pitt to fast-track his earlier proposal to require CEOs and chief
financial officers to attest with their signatures not only that
their numbers are correct, but also that they aren't omitting
anything important.</LD>
<LD>   The exact wording of the proposal is expected to be unveiled
today, SEC spokesman John Nester said. The rule would apply to 965
U.S. companies with annual revenue of $1.2 billion or more, he said.
It would take effect Aug. 15 after an accelerated approval process.</LD>
<TE>   CEOs and CFOs already are required to sign annual and quarterly
financial statements known as forms 10-K and 10-Q. The new rule would
add "an extra level of intensity," said Charles Gradante, president
of Hennessee Group, an investment advisory firm.</TE>
<TE>   "I know from running my own business, as soon as you ask somebody
who submits anything to you to sign off on it, you see how fast they
start proofreading it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some in the business community questioned whether the
certification procedure is workable.</TE>
<TE>   One chief executive, who would be required to sign the new
certification, said the proposal doesn't address what happens when a
CEO has questions about whether GAAP--generally accepted accounting
principles--truly reflects a company's financial status.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Richard M.
Kovacevich said in an interview that his bank had a dispute with its
auditor over the accounting treatment of a venture capital investment
when its paper value ballooned during the Internet bubble. The
dispute, he said, involved a legitimately debatable issue.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we signing off on?" Kovacevich asked. "How I think
something should be stated or what GAAP says?"</TE>
<TE>   Big corporations are so complex that even the most conscientious
executive can fail to grasp all the details, Thomas Donohue,
president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "If the CEO of a $50-billion corporation operating in 112
countries is required to sign a document saying he guarantees under
penalty of law that all these numbers are correct, there's not a CEO
in America that will sign it," Donohue said.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule might make it easier for civil plaintiffs or
prosecutors to sweep aside an executive's protestations of ignorance,
but it isn't a magic bullet against fraud, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It allows the prosecutor to say you claimed to have knowledge and
you affirmed that everything was legal and correct," said Theodore
Sonde, a former SEC enforcement lawyer now in private practice. "But
it doesn't prove the case that the CEO knew the books were cooked."</TE>
<TE>   Ted Fiflis, law professor at the University of Colorado at
Boulder, said the rule at least would make an executive think twice
about relying on the assurances of an underling.</TE>
<TE>   "No CEO is going to let his own neck be wrung because the CFO does
something wrong," Fiflis said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Enron Corp., top executives have pleaded ignorance
of accounting maneuvers that helped bring down the company.</TE>
<TE>   One aspect of the proposal that has been ignored is that the
signed declaration could give the top brass of a well-run company
"the opportunity to say you do things right," the SEC's Nester said.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, the rule change could help boost investor
confidence, he said.</TE>

<HD>Bill Seeks Limits on Radio Giants</HD>
<DH>Media: Sen. Feingold says his proposal targets abuses
arising from industry consolidation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saying recent radio industry consolidation has reduced the diversity
of music played on the air and hiked concert prices for consumers,
Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) proposed new restrictions Thursday on
radio giants such as Clear Channel Communications Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Feingold's bill is a sweeping attempt to prevent large radio
companies from using their size and power to hurt smaller station
owners and from bullying artists to play at radio-station-sponsored
concerts. The bill also would toughen payola laws by preventing
record companies from using third-party promoters to pay stations for
airplay. And it would give the Federal Communications Commission the
power to revoke radio licenses of companies that abuse their power.</LD>
<LD>   The bill is certain to draw stiff opposition in Washington, where
federal regulators appointed by President Bush and some key members
of Congress are pushing to relax regulations on broadcasters, rather
than toughen them.</LD>
<TE>   Feingold said his bill, the Competition in Radio and Concert
Industries Act, would close loopholes left by the 1996
Telecommunications Act, which removed the national ownership limit
for radio stations and opened the floodgates for consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to repair the damage that has been done by the
unprecedented consolidation in this industry," Feingold said.</TE>
<TE>   Though prospects for passage of the bill this year are slim given
the large number of issues before Congress, Feingold's measure deals
with many of the complaints raised by consumer groups about
consolidation in the radio business.</TE>
<TE>   Feingold said he had no plans to reinstate a national radio
ownership cap, but his bill would give the FCC new powers to block
future acquisitions by companies that already reach more than 60% of
the national audience. His measure also would prevent the FCC from
increasing the number of radio stations a company may own in the same
market. In large markets, the current limit is eight stations.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio-based Clear Channel has been one of the biggest
beneficiaries of the 1996 act. The company has grown from a single
station 30 years ago to 1,200 radio stations today.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe it is in the best interest of any of our
constituencies to have the government legislate private business
practices to the degree that Sen. Feingold proposes," said Clear
Channel President Mark P. Mays.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel's stock fell to a 52-week low during the day and
despite a late rally fell $4.55, or 13%, to $31.20 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Mays said that consolidation in the radio industry--in which the
top 10 station owners generate 44% of the industry's revenue--still
is less than in other industries, such as movies and cable TV.</TE>
<TE>   But Feingold noted that the top four radio companies, including
Clear Channel, control as much as 96% of some local markets.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the top four companies control 70% of the
stations.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say companies such as Clear Channel have grown too
powerful by also gaining control over concert venues, billboard
advertising and promotion businesses. According to Feingold, such
concentration has contributed to a 60% increase in concert ticket
prices since 1996, far greater than the rate of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Musicians also have said that Clear Channel is demanding unfair
terms--such as forcing artists to perform for free at promotions or
pressuring them to use Clear Channel's concert-promotion services--in
exchange for playing their songs on its radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   But Mays blamed rising ticket prices on musical artists, who are
"demanding more money to perform than ever before."</TE>
<TE>   He also denied that broadcasters were demanding "pay-for-play"
fees from record companies, blaming the practice on the five major
record conglomerates, which pay third-party promoters to promote
their songs to radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of disciplining themselves to break this pattern, they
are asking Congress to do it for them," Mays said.</TE>
<TE>   Feingold's bill also takes aim at efforts to circumvent federal
rules that prevent companies from owning more than eight radio
stations in a market. Some radio giants have signed marketing
agreements with local stations that give them control over playlists
and advertising, even though they don't own the station.</TE>
<TE>   Under Feingold's bill, such agreements would be counted under the
local ownership rule. His measure also would prevent the FCC from
increasing the eight-station cap.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say lawmakers facing November reelection will have little
appetite to take on the broadcasting industry this year. But artists
groups and record labels are hopeful that the bill will tee up the
issue for action next year.</TE>

<HD>Rumors Rock GM, Clear Channel Stocks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street wasn't rocked Thursday by news of another accounting
scandal. But rumors of bookkeeping irregularities took a toll on two
big-name stocks.</LD>
<LD>   Both General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker and a
member of the Dow Jones industrial average, and Clear Channel
Communications Inc., the nation's biggest radio station owner, denied
what the companies said were rumors regarding problems with their
books.</LD>
<LD>   In an atmosphere charged by recent revelations of corporate
accounting woes--most recently WorldCom Inc.'s bombshell Tuesday that
it would have to restate earnings--investors decided to sell first
and ask questions later.</LD>
<TE>   Trading of GM shares was briefly halted on the New York Stock
Exchange because of an imbalance of buy and sell orders. The stock
ended the day down $1.58 at $51.50.</TE>
<TE>   "General Motors is not subject to an accounting investigation and
strongly believes that its accounting is appropriate," a GM spokesman
said. "GM believes that rumors of irregularities in its accounting
are unfounded."</TE>
<TE>   Some market analysts speculated that the GM rumor was floated by
short sellers--investors who try to profit from falling stock prices.
Short sellers often are accused of spreading false, damaging
information about a company in an attempt to drive down its stock.</TE>
<TE>   In Clear Channel's case, the company denied rumors that it is
being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. News
reports stated that the San Antonio-based company canceled an
investor conference call, but a spokeswoman said no such conference
had been scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not an SEC investigation of Clear Channel and there are
no accounting issues or irregularities," Clear Channel President Mark
Mays said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said Mays issued his SEC statement after Clear Channel
was bombarded with calls from Wall Street analysts about a possible
probe and the conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel's stock was already under pressure after a bill was
introduced in Congress on Thursday that would limit radio station
ownership and split radio stations and concert promoters. By day's
end, its shares were down $4.55 to $31.20 in NYSE trading. Volume
exceeded 30 million shares, far above Clear Channel's daily average.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnson &amp; Johnson said that the number of patients who have developed
a rare blood disorder when treated with the firm's anemia drug has
risen to 124 worldwide and that one of those patients died.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Canadian doctors, Johnson &amp; Johnson said it is
investigating possible triggers of the blood disorder, called pure
red-blood cell aplasia. Aplasia is a condition in which the bone
marrow fails to produce vital red blood cells--the opposite of the
drug's intended function.</LD>
<LD>   The drug Eprex, which has been around for 15 years, is marketed in
the United States as Procrit. It mainly is for cancer patients who
develop anemia as a result of chemotherapy. Combined global sales of
Eprex and Procrit last year were about $3.8 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson &amp; Johnson shares rose 27 cents to $54.41 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Genentech Inc.'s breast cancer drug Herceptin, which had sales of
$346.6 million last year, infringes a patent held by Chiron Corp., a
federal judge in Sacramento has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The Monday ruling sends the case to a trial in August. A jury will
decide whether the Chiron patent is valid and if Genentech willfully

<LD>   Emeryville, Calif.-based Chiron sued Genentech in June 2000,
alleging that Herceptin infringed 25 claims of a 31-claim patent
issued in April 2000.</LD>
<TE>   South San Francisco-based Genentech said in court papers it
independently developed Herceptin in the mid-1980s. The Food and Drug

<LD>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is suing UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines over a ramp worker's claims she was sexually and
racially harassed and retaliated against after she complained.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit alleges the worker, who is black, was regularly called
racial epithets by her supervisor at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport and harassed by her co-workers, who were all male. After
complaining, she was repeatedly assigned undesirable work, which
usually was rotated among crew members, and was ultimately fired, the
federal agency claims.</LD>
<LD>   A United spokeswoman said the airline does not comment on pending
litigation.</LD>
<TE>   The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages and an injunction
prohibiting harassment and discrimination at United in the future. It
was filed after efforts to reach a settlement with the airline
failed, the EEOC said.</TE>

<LD>General Electric Co. said it will meet second-quarter profit
forecasts as a $358-million tax settlement tempers losses at its
insurance unit and from WorldCom Inc. bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Third-quarter profit will rise by "solid double digits," Chief
Financial Officer Keith Sherin said. For the second quarter, earnings
should match the 44-cent average estimate of analysts, with sales up
3% to 5%, Sherin said.</LD>
<LD>   GE plans to write down $110 million in losses on WorldCom bonds,
and expects a loss of $240 million at its Employers Re insurance unit
on adjustments from policies written across its business areas.</LD>
<TE>   That will be cushioned by a settlement with the Internal Revenue
Service of $358 million in the quarter, Sherin said.</TE>

<HD>Ernst &amp; Young Affiliate Fined in Audit-Independence Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a number of
possible audit-independence abuses by U.S. accounting firms, an SEC
official said Thursday as the agency announced a $400,000 fine of
Ernst &amp; Young's Dutch affiliate.</LD>
<LD>   "There may well be audit-independence cases coming down soon,
including some involving the Big Four accounting firms," Paul R.
Berger, the SEC's associate enforcement director, said in an
interview.</LD>
<LD>   SEC rules forbid auditors from doing other business with clients
because it may lead auditors to go easy on checking the books.</LD>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young's Dutch affiliate was censured for "improper
professional conduct" in connection with its audits of Baan from 1995
to 1997, while the firm was helping Baan sell its software, the SEC
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ernst &amp; Young affiliate agreed to pay a $400,000 penalty, the
first fine against an accounting firm for audit-independence
violations, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Ernst &amp; Young Netherlands declined to comment. The
firm neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of its
settlement, the SEC said.</TE>

<HD>'Vultures' Circling Depressed Securities</HD>
<DH>Investing: Money managers who focus on distressed issues
have plenty of choices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Vulture" investors, who specialize in buying the riskiest securities
on Wall Street, are swooping in to scoop up bonds of troubled telecom
firms, some trading at just pennies on the dollar.</LD>
<LD>   But many of the bonds continued to slide Thursday as other
investors fled, fearful of being caught in the next corporate blowup.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, the common stocks of many cable TV companies fell
sharply for a second day, reflecting Wall Street's concerns that the
industry's accounting methods could be masking deeper losses,
analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Among cable firms, Cablevision Systems' shares sank $1.39 to $8.11
and AOL Time Warner fell as low as $12.75 before rebounding somewhat
to close unchanged at $13.63.</TE>
<TE>   Telecom giant WorldCom Inc.'s shocking disclosure this week that
it misaccounted for $3.9 billion in expenses over the last five
quarters triggered another massive selling wave in the telecom
sector, already deeply depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts expect WorldCom, burdened by nearly $30 billion in
debt, to file for bankruptcy protection soon, though the company has
denied it will seek bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   As pension funds and other institutional investors have bailed out
of bonds of WorldCom and other telecom companies, money managers who
take gambles on such distressed securities have been stepping up.</TE>
<TE>   Those investors, nicknamed vultures, include Marty Whitman of the
Third Avenue Funds in New York. He said he bought about $150 million
of WorldCom's senior debt Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Some WorldCom bonds have been trading as low as 11 cents on the
dollar, down from 40 cents before the company reported the accounting
scandal late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Vulture investors have plenty of other distressed bonds to pick
from. For example, cable firm Charter Communications' 8.63% bonds
maturing in 2009 were trading at 76 cents on the dollar Thursday,
down from 81 cents Wednesday and 95 cents in early May.</TE>
<TE>   In the telecom sector, Lucent Technologies' 7.25% bonds maturing
in 2006 fell to 78 cents on the dollar Thursday from 93 cents
Wednesday. Lucent stock fell to a new record low, down 6 cents to
$1.52 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In a bankruptcy, a company's common stockholders often end up with
nothing, because they're last on the list of those with claims on the
company's assets. Bondholders are paid before them, and usually can
expect to recover some percentage of the bonds' face value.</TE>
<TE>   For vulture investors such as Whitman, the trick is either to find
deeply depressed bonds of companies that are likely to stay
financially viable, or to estimate how much bondholders ultimately
might be awarded by a Bankruptcy Court if a company fails.</TE>
<TE>   With WorldCom bonds at pennies on the dollar, Whitman said, "I
think the probabilities I will make money are on my side."</TE>
<TE>   Wilbur Ross, chairman of investment firm W.L. Ross &amp; Co. in New
York, said he began buying WorldCom bonds Wednesday morning at 7 a.m.
"Buying these bonds at 12 and 13 cents on the dollar strikes us as a
high-rate-of-return proposition," said Ross. "We had not, thank
goodness, been buying the bonds before that."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, investors who bought telecom bonds at what they thought
were distressed prices a few months ago have suffered huge paper
losses as the bonds have fallen further, and more of the companies
appear to be in grave danger of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Though vulture investors often are betting on bankruptcy, dealing
in distressed securities is always very risky, analysts note.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very treacherous," said Russ Belinsky, senior managing
director with Chanin Capital Partners, a restructuring advisory firm
in Santa Monica. "You have to look very closely at the business plan
[likely to be] coming out of a reorganization."</TE>
<TE>   In the cable sector, the sell-off this week in the industry's
bonds and stocks has been fueled by worries that the companies'
favored measure of profit, which ignores their expenses for long-term
capital expenditures, has been vulnerable to manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is accused of booking normal operating expenses as
capital expenditures, allowing the company to report a profit when
it, in fact, was deep in the red.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Reif Cohen, analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said in a
report Thursday that the cable industry's reputation for large
capital expenditures "reignited concerns that cable companies could
also be overcapitalizing expenses" and overstating cash flow,
according to Reuters, which obtained a copy of the report.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the failure of cable firm Adelphia Communications,
also embroiled in an accounting scandal, has tainted investors' view
of the entire industry.</TE>
<TE>   But Cohen argued in the report that the accounting worries are
"overblown."</TE>

<HD>Some Lawmakers Take Big WorldCom Hit</HD>
<DH>Government: Many members of Congress held the stock last
year and saw its value plummet.</DH>

<AU>GLEN JUSTICE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rep. Tom Osborne looked bullish on WorldCom Inc. and all of its
telecommunications businesses last year.</LD>
<LD>   The Nebraska Republican held shares worth at least $500,000 in the
company's WorldCom Group, which sells data services--his single
largest stock holding, according to disclosure statements. He also
owned at least $15,000 in the company's MCI Group, which sells
long-distance service.</LD>
<LD>   Osborne sold his stock last week, spokeswoman Kelly Sokol said. He
didn't want to talk about it. "He doesn't want to get into his
personal financial record," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Like tens of thousands of disillusioned investors, many U.S.
lawmakers and their families held WorldCom stock last year, financial
disclosures show.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are subject to market fluctuations as they consider
legislation or conduct investigations involving companies in which
they own shares.</TE>
<TE>   "One would hope that one does not impact the other," said Richard
Shapiro, a partner in Ernst &amp; Young's tax group who has counseled
investors who went into public service. "When you are in a position
of public trust, one's holdings should not impact the decision-making
process. But human nature being what it is, that's not always the
case."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John Isakson, a Georgia Republican, held $15,000 to $50,000
in WorldCom stock at the end of 2000 that fell to $1,001 to $15,000
last year, according to disclosures. Lawmakers report their assets
within a range rather than an exact dollar amount. Earlier this year,
Isakson said, he sold "what was left," though he didn't give details.</TE>
<TE>   Isakson said he expected Congress to hold hearings on WorldCom and
was encouraging executives to condemn abuses reported. Though he
opposes government intervention, he backs reforms that eliminate
interlocking boards of directors and initiate third-party review of
company audits.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate risk and reward. I've won and I've lost. That's fine
when the game is fair," he said. "Years ago the stock market was an
inside game. Now it's an inside game with outsiders' money. And
that's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Thad Cochran, a Republican from WorldCom's home state of
Mississippi, held $1,001 to $15,000 each in WorldCom Group and MCI
Group. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, also of Mississippi,
reported $1,001 to $15,000 in WorldCom stock in his wife's account.
Neither Cochran nor Lott could be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which handles
telecommunications issues, held WorldCom stock in 2001. Among them
were Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the ranking Democrat, and Rep. Lois
Capps, a Democrat from Santa Barbara. Each held $1,001 to $15,000 in
shares, according to disclosures.</TE>

<HD>State Pension Funds Face Huge Losses</HD>
<DH>Damage: WorldCom woes inflict $1-billion hit. But officials
tell members not to worry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The largest pension funds in the United States, overseers of
multibillion-dollar public employee retirement funds, said Thursday
that they lost well over $1 billion on stock and bond investments in
telecom giant WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the biggest
U.S pension fund, faces an unrealized loss of $565 million in its
$150-billion portfolio. New York state's retirement system, the
second-largest, with $112 billion in assets, estimates it lost $300
million on WorldCom stock and bond investments.</LD>
<LD>   "Occasionally you will have human error. But this is not human
error. It is deceit, and we are not happy about it," said Gary
Bruebaker, chief investment officer of the Washington State
Investment Board. His state's $42-billion pension fund took a
$75.3-million hit on the long-distance phone company's bonds.</LD>
<TE>   Bruebaker said his board would look at its options, including
possibly a suit for damages.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance phone company, Tuesday
disclosed $3.9 billion in improperly treated expenses that boosted
its reported cash flow, a closely watched measure of operating
profitability.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, state Comptroller Carl McCall "is outraged that
another irresponsible corporate action has defrauded members of the
pension system and all investors," said his spokesman, Jeffrey
Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Still, pension benefit recipients can relax for now, state
officials said. WorldCom accounted for less than half of 1% of
CalPERS' holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Reser, a spokeswoman for the California State Teachers'
Retirement System, said the losses would have no effect on its
members' pensions and contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Teachers, the third-largest U.S. public pension fund, with
$100 billion in assets, suffered a $109-million unrealized loss
because of WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares, which peaked at more than $64 in 1999,
disintegrated Tuesday, plunging to 83 cents on Nasdaq and to 35 cents
in after-hours trading. It did not open for trading Wednesday or
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Some states, such as Tennessee, which lost $9 million in its $23
billion state pension fund, got off lightly because they sold
WorldCom earlier this year.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp. dropped out of the bidding for bankrupt KPNQwest's data
network, Europe's largest, with a tangle of legal and ownership
issues likely scuttling plans to sell it in one piece.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. telecom giant and Dutch venture fund Trimoteur were seen
as the two groups interested in buying the entire data network, which
reaches from Portugal to Finland, excluding its self- sustaining
central European assets.</LD>
<LD>   Potential buyers also were more jumpy after KPNQwest's auditors
announced that they had not approved the firm's 2001 results,
disputing statements made by the firm's former chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   As with ailing WorldCom, which faces federal fraud charges,
KPNQwest's auditor was Arthur Andersen.</TE>

Motorola to its size of the mid- 1990s, "the era prior to the
excesses of the telecom and dot-com booms," Chief Executive
Christopher Galvin said.</LD>

<HD>Forest Homeowners Play With Fire</HD>
<DH>Often, taxpayers face the bill for their carelessness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN F. ARNO and STEVEN ALLISON-BUNNELL</AU>
<BD>Stephen F. Arno and Steven Allison-Bunnell are
co-authors of "Flames in Our Forest: Disaster or Renewal?" (Island
Press, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal and state agencies have already spent millions of dollars in
frantically attempting to save Western forests from the fires now
consuming them. They will spend millions more. Paradoxically,
however, science tells us they are defying nature.</LD>
<LD>   Fire has been woven into the fabric of Western forest ecosystems
for countless years. It did not destroy but, in fact, created
magnificent stands of old-growth ponderosa pine, western larch,
western white pine, coastal Douglas fir and giant sequoia. Fire
helped renew Rocky Mountain aspen groves and many species of
fruit-bearing shrubs and succulent herbs important for wildlife.</LD>
<LD>   Still, we struggle to remove the fire from "fire-dependent"
forests because of the threat it poses to a few million homes, cabins
and other development in the woods. Structures built in earthquake or
hurricane country must meet rigorous construction standards. If they
don't, insurance companies may not insure them. There are no
corresponding standards for structures built in fire country. Zoning
regulations tend to be weak, and property owners vigorously defend
their right to build as they see fit. As a result, thousands of
vulnerable homes are constructed in forests each year.</LD>
<TE>   Firefighting agencies try to educate forest homeowners about what
they can do to reduce damage from wildfires--the Web site
www.firewise.org is one resource--but there are few incentives or
regulations to encourage or compel responsible action. Instead,
homeowners expect, even demand, "free" government fire protection.
For example, they want a fire engine and crew stationed at each
threatened house until the fire moves on or is extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   The solution to this dilemma of more development in the forests,
and forest homeowners' expectations that the government will rescue
them from fire, may be a dose of "tough love" that requires the kind
of personal responsibility normally associated with life in the rural
West a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Subsidized fire protection should be provided primarily to
homeowners who make their forest homes defensible during a wildfire.
This can be accomplished by taking the following measures:</TE>
<TE>   First, the access road to the property should be well-signed and
cleared of brush and there should be a turnaround for fire engines.</TE>
<TE>   Second, tree thickets adjacent to a structure should be thinned
and the branches and tops removed, along with brush and other natural
fire fuel within 120 feet of buildings. Trees farther away should be
thinned to make the "home forest" less vulnerable. Firewood and other
flammables should not be stored near the structure.</TE>
<TE>   Third, combustible roofs should be replaced. Pine needles should
be cleared from roofs and gutters.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a sprinkler system should be considered.</TE>
<TE>   These measures are not technically difficult or particularly
expensive, considering the values of home and forest property at
risk. Indeed, they are simply part of adapting to forest life.</TE>
<TE>   A natural Western forest used to be tended by fire. Leaving the
city or suburbs to get away from it all doesn't free forest dwellers
from yardwork. The alternative is that fire will do the work on its
own.</TE>

<HD>On the God Issue, Let's Take the Pledge</HD>
<DH>Empires, not democracies, fuse church and state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone agrees that the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling
banning the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance won't last.
That's too bad.</LD>
<LD>   The United States should stand tall by itself and not exist as an
object under anyone's interpretation of religion.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, the court's decision was poorly thought out. The
three-judge panel opined that reference to God was equivalent to a
declaration "that we are a nation 'under Jesus,' a nation 'under
Vishnu,' a nation 'under Zeus,' or a nation 'under no god.' " Huh?
"God" is, after all, a generic term for a deity, whereas Jesus,
Vishnu and Zeus are specific names, and no god is, well, no god.</LD>
<TE>   No wonder the decision is being derided everywhere. Words such as
"outrageous" and "idiotic" and "just nuts" filled the airwaves; the
Senate voted 99 to 0 to deplore the ruling, and Sen. Joe Lieberman
(D-Conn.) was quick to volunteer that if necessary Congress would act
to pass a constitutional amendment.</TE>
<TE>   But if the words "under God" are so vital, why weren't they in the
pledge until 1954? The U.S. managed to get along for nearly two
centuries without asking for God's help every morning in home
room--indeed, the pledge didn't exist in any form until 1892.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, oaths are a good idea, for this nation and for every
nation. As the French sociologist Emile Durkheim observed: "There can
be no society which does not feel the need of upholding and
reaffirming at regular intervals the collective sentiments and the
collective ideas which make its unity." But if so, we might think
hard about what sort of unity we strive for.</TE>
<TE>   Forget for the moment that plenty of folks are left out of the
"under God" formulation--atheists, pantheists, polytheists. Think
instead of those whose faith, be it Baptist, Catholic or Wahhabi,
might come ahead of state. That's why the national motto "e pluribus
unum"--out of many, one--is far more valuable for a complex country
than "In God We Trust."</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 should have heightened concern about the
national well-being, not about God's will. The firefighters at the
World Trade Center didn't die for God; they died for the people of
New York, and for the U.S. in general. It might be nice to think that
they're all in heaven, but of course fans of Mohamed Atta think that
he and the other 18 Al Qaeda hijackers are in heaven too.</TE>
<TE>   It could be that the whole flap is nothing more than a ritualized
exercise in civic hypocrisy, in which politicians seek to expand
their own power at the expense of the liberty that comes from the
separation of church and state. Is that an unreasonable conclusion in
watching lawmakers scramble to be pledgier than thou? The winner in
that contest seems to be Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.), who led a posse of pious politicians onto the steps of the
Capitol for a round of pledge-allegiancing. And yet the republic
still stands.</TE>
<TE>   Still, watching leaders stand on the steps of that neoclassical
building reciting incantations of chosen words, one was reminded of
other politicians who in the past wrapped themselves in the
righteousness of the divine. It was self-serving for the solons,
maybe even a bit queasy-making to behold, but it worked for those in
charge.</TE>
<TE>   As the great historian Edward Gibbon observed of the Roman empire
at its peak, the two powers, religious and political, were fused into
one tool of social control. It was cynical but it worked: "The
various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all
considered by the people as equally true; by the philosophers as
equally false; and by the magistrates as equally useful."</TE>
<TE>   In those days, the politicians didn't care what deity people
worshiped, as long as they worshiped the politicians at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, what's useful for empires is not so good for
democracies. The San Francisco judges may have gotten their legal
reasoning wrong, and they certainly got their political spin wrong,
but they showed historical wisdom. In pledging, it's best to keep the
state and God separate, no matter how desperate politicians might be
to combine the two devotions into one aggrandizing state-religion.</TE>

<HD>Cussing's OK but Not Reverence?</HD>
<DH>Court's decision could be the last straw for many.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAL THOMAS</AU>
<BD>Excerpted from Cal Thomas' syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling will encapsulate what
many Americans, especially crucial swing voters, think is wrong with
this country. We tolerate and protect those who wish to take God's
name in vain, whether it's a cursing student or a book containing
blasphemies that is assigned by a teacher--who is an agent of the
state. But we penalize anyone who dares to speak well of God and we
treat the Bible as contraband, where once it was welcomed and even
given out free in schools.</LD>
<LD>   Many Americans will see this judicial attempt to further
secularize culture as less of an effort to protect the rights of a
child than part of our national problem.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to whatever political benefits (or detriments,
depending on the political party) this ruling might have, it also
could be the last straw for many who have children in public schools.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court's decision Thursday upholding the
constitutionality of Cleveland's school choice program, which allows
taxpayer money to be used to underwrite tuition at private and
parochial schools--including religious schools--will allow many
families the financial freedom to seek schools friendlier to their
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   The circuit court's ruling on the pledge will not stand, even if
the U.S. Supreme Court upholds it. If upheld on appeal, it will turn
millions of Americans into lawbreakers because they'll continue to
say the Pledge of Allegiance, just as many continue to pray before
school athletic contests in violation of court prohibitions.</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelming majority of Americans have been forced to stomach
a lot of garbage in recent years, from pornography to flag burning,
all for the sake of a supposedly "healthy" 1st Amendment. For them,
any move to ban the pledge would be the final insult, and woe to the
politician or judge who gets in their way.</TE>

<HD>Court's Message to Students: Just Say No to the Chess Club</HD>
<DH>Extracurricular activities become a drug-test trap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley teaches constitutional law at George
Washington University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court spoke directly to
children who are interested in experimenting with drugs. The message
is clear and simple: Focus all of your attention on drugs or face
expulsion.</LD>
<LD>   This curious message is the product of a 5-4 ruling in Board of
Education vs. Earls, in which the court upheld the right of high
schools to compel drug testing of any student interested in
extracurricular activities without any showing of individual
suspicion of drug use. The decision by Associate Justice Clarence
Thomas upholding such "suspicionless" testing ensures that every
child experimenting with drugs will now choose between making drugs
their exclusive interest and going drug-free with the chess club.</LD>
<LD>   Although the court once insisted that children "do not shed their
constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate," the relative
rights of children are vastly different within the school. Past cases
focused on lockers and speech. However, in a 1995 case out of
Vernonia, Ore., the court extended its school rulings to physical
searches and allowed suspicionless drug testing of student athletes.
This ruling was based in part on the obvious physical danger of
students playing sports while on drugs.</LD>
<TE>   The image of some coked-up student diving the wrong way off a high
board was enough for the court. Moreover, the court stressed that the
school was facing an "epidemic" of drugs and that athletes were the
natural leaders of the "drug culture."</TE>
<TE>   In the current case, the officials at the Pottawatomie school
district in Tecumseh, Okla., did not find this nearly broad enough.
The school decided to test all students engaged in extracurricular
activities, including strictly nonsports activities ranging from
yearbook staff to the academic team.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it is hard to imagine the danger of a high school
student in such nonathletic activities. While the chess coach may be
suspicious as to why Junior used the Queen's Gambit as an opening
move, the opposing player is probably safe from immediate harm.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, where the Vernonia school documented a student
population in "a state of rebellion ... fueled by alcohol and drug
abuse," Tecumseh school officials testified that only three high
school students out of a class of 243 tested positive for drugs in a
two-year period. Notably, all three played sports.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Thomas, however, removed these factors as prerequisites
for suspicionless testing for high schools across the country. While
the court repeated its privacy concern over "an excretory function,"
it found drug testing to not be intrusive at the school. The court
noted that a teacher can require all students to reveal what
prescriptions they are taking and then stand outside a stall to
"listen for the normal sounds of urination"--each student is expected
to make such normal sounds to the satisfaction of the teacher.
Abnormal-sounding students apparently face repeated testing.</TE>
<TE>   In her concurrence, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that this
new ruling was not so bad because students can simply decline to
participate in any extracurricular activities. It is the dream of
every high school deadhead: Just say no to extracurricular
activities. The decision will now free up time for an exclusive
commitment to the drug culture and build peer identification with
those pledging to live "activity-free."</TE>
<TE>   It is often said that we learn to be citizens in high school. With
decisions like Earls, it is not hard to imagine the lessons of
citizenship being taught to our children. If our schools become a
learning ground for personal submission and collective monitoring,
our children will replicate these lessons as citizens. The increasing
levels of surveillance and monitoring in our lives have created a
type of fish-bowl society that would have been unthinkable a
generation ago. As the "expectation of privacy" declines further with
this new generation, we may find that the exceptions allowed for
schools today become the rule for society tomorrow.</TE>

<HD>Personality Politics Snag the Budget</HD>
<DH>Davis and Burton pursue their spat as deadline nears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL WHALEN</AU>
<BD>Bill Whalen, a research fellow at Hoover Institution at
Stanford, worked on Richard Riordan's gubernatorial exploratory
committee in 2001 and was a speechwriter for Gov. Pete Wilson.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California will greet July and the dawn of a new fiscal year without
a state budget. Just when that new spending plan might be completed
is anyone's guess: Independence Day? Bastille Day? Certainly, we
hope, before Labor Day.</LD>
<LD>   So what's keeping lawmakers from completing what voters hired them
to do? It's less the usual rift between Republicans and Democrats
than a deeper divide between the two most powerful Democrats in
Sacramento--Gov. Gray Davis and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton.
Unless one of them budges, neither does the budget. Thus California
begins down the slippery slope of a decade ago, when a prolonged
stalemate meant the interruption of health and nursing home services
for elderly and disabled Californians.</LD>
<LD>   Burton and Davis are political opposites--Burton a steadfast
old-guard liberal and Davis a triangulating "New Democrat" moderate.
Any chance that the two could get along as power brokers ended six
months into the Davis administration when the governor remarked that
the Legislature existed "to implement my vision." Burton returned the
slight by skipping the governor's State of the State address, later
telling reporters the big speech "had no relevance to reality in the
budget." Now, they disagree just as deeply about how to deal with the
deficit.</LD>
<TE>   Burton wants to raise the state's top income tax rate. Under his
proposal, the top rate of 9.3% would jump to 10% for single filers
earning more than $130,000; 11% if their income exceeded $260,000.
For couples, the 10% rate would kick in at $260,000; 11% when income
exceeded $520,000. Davis, unlike Burton, is up for reelection this
fall. So instead the governor prefers to raise taxes on vehicle
owners and tobacco users.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that, if they had a different relationship, Burton
could be seen as doing Davis a favor. No California governor has
raised taxes so close to a gubernatorial election in which he was
running. But Burton's insistence offers Davis some cover. The
governor could also cite historical precedent: Ronald Reagan twice
raised taxes when faced with a budget meltdown, in 1967 and 1971;
Pete Wilson did it once, in 1991. And should Republican gubernatorial
hopeful Bill Simon Jr. chime in, Davis could remind voters that Simon
has never released his tax returns, so who is he to pontificate about
tax burdens? Perhaps Davis really means it when he says it's "hands
off" income tax rates. But parse the governor's modest protests
against raising the upper tax brackets: "I don't think that makes
sense. I think we're unduly dependent on higher-income earners as it
is." Noticeably absent is a phrase like "over my dead body."</TE>
<TE>   Here's my hunch: Davis understands the dynamics of California's
budget process. He'll agree to increasing income taxes, but only when
the moment is right--and that's not for two weeks or so.</TE>
<TE>   Once the July 1 deadline for the new budget passes, pressure for a
fix begins to grow, and it worsens as the impasse lengthens. Interest
groups will descend upon lawmakers and perhaps even stage protests.
The media will vividly depict the hardship imposed on local
government because Sacramento doesn't have its act together. Enter
Davis, riding to the rescue, saying he reluctantly has agreed to
raise income taxes for the public's good.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, it's not exactly making a silk purse out of a sow's ear,
but it avoids a long, hot summer stuck in Sacramento and, better yet,
keeps Davis from being stuck in long budget negotiations with his
foe, Burton. Then the dust will settle and the two can get back to
their Cold War over who's the king under the Capitol Dome.</TE>

<LD>Stop-gap funding will keep Amtrak running perhaps through the summer.
But just pumping more money into Amtrak fixes nothing unless the
mismanaged service curbs its spending and reforms its operations.
Fortunately, Amtrak has new President David L. Gunn, who has an
impressive record of turning around transportation systems, including
New York's and Boston's. His no-nonsense reforms have a ring of
credibility that should mollify Congress and the White House until he
has a chance to prove himself.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the dire warnings in Washington about an Amtrak shutdown
cited the popular, heavily used Metroliner trains running from
Washington to New York to Boston. But in California, Amtrak is
gaining fast in importance. Southern California's Metrolink commuter
trains use the same rails as Amtrak and subcontract for some Amtrak
employees.  The Capitol Corridor, which runs between Sacramento and
San Jose and carries close to 100,000 passengers a month, is the
fastest-growing line in the country. Gov. Gray Davis has warned
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta--a Californian who should
know--that an abrupt shutdown of Amtrak would have a "serious and
adverse" impact on 80,000 daily commuters.</LD>
<TE>   Amtrak lost $1.2 billion last year, and Standard &amp; Poor's has
reduced its credit rating to one notch above junk status. Union
featherbedding, a bloated management structure and highly
unprofitable routes in the West that are kept alive by congressional
pork-barrel politics have made Amtrak a financial sinkhole. Gunn is
trying to reinvent it: He has axed useless consultants and vice
presidents and is insisting upon detailed, monthly financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak enemies in Congress want to kill it outright or sell off
the most profitable routes and shut down the rest. Congress should
resist the efforts of House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and
White House Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. to abandon
passenger rail. Despite its problems, Amtrak has shown that it can
run high-speed rail and commuter lines that attract passengers. A
proposal by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) offering $1.2 billion to
build high-speed corridors and improve tracks would give Amtrak the
upgrades it needs to attract more riders and compete with airline
shuttles.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn is correctly trying to preserve national rail service, but
some costly routes such as the California Zephyr, from Chicago to
Oakland, may have to go.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how good Gunn is and how sleek Amtrak becomes, it is
still public transportation and will require federal support. Just as
the government builds highways and oversees air travel, some taxpayer
investment in rail is inescapable. But Amtrak can't rely on
last-minute bailouts. It must strike the balance between profligacy
and oblivion.</TE>

<LD>For decades, the Blue Light Mine in the Cleveland National Forest has
attracted adventurous souls. Conquering it, or another of the
abandoned mines dotting the area's landscape, is a local rite of
passage. But this week the Blue Light's murky waters and toxic gas
pockets claimed the lives of two young explorers, one of whom had
just graduated from high school.</LD>
<LD>   A culture does itself more harm than good by trying to protect its
youth from all risk. But this mine was a deathtrap. Signs warning of
the threat of hypothermia in the dark water might have dissuaded the
brothers from diving in wearing T-shirts. Signs noting the deadly
gases inside would almost certainly have sent them in search of a
different feat of daring.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Forest Service oversees the Cleveland's 427,000 acres.
Officials say there is no money available to seal the mine's eight
openings, let alone to close the area's hundreds of other mine
shafts. In fact, there are more than 46,000 abandoned mines and
quarries in California. The Bureau of Land Management tries to post
signs at those in its 15 million acres in California, but budgetary
and personnel restraints severely restrict this effort. Indeed,
government agencies close only a few mines each year, and those
threatening the natural environment get priority.</LD>
<TE>   Even if the money were available, however, we wouldn't want to see
forests and historic areas littered with the sorts of fortifications
that are necessary to keep determined adventure seekers at bay. It is
quintessentially American to yearn for adventure, to want to test
oneself against risks that fear of litigation and modern conveniences
have all but eliminated from most people's lives. But reasonable
risk-taking is based on a grasp of the dangers involved.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service should post signs outside the Blue Light and
any other mine known to be dangerous. Other agencies should follow
suit. These would warn off all but the stupid or suicidal--people who
simply cannot be protected from themselves.</TE>

<LD>It's been quite a week of extremes for the courts and religion. A
federal appeals court said God couldn't be mentioned in the Pledge of
Allegiance; now a closely divided Supreme Court held Thursday that
spending public money to pay tuition costs at religious schools was
constitutional and did not violate the separation of church and
state.</LD>
<LD>   The appeals court decision regarding the pledge was more silly
than threatening; the high court's voucher ruling, however, has
serious implications. Public money should not be used to promote
proselytizing and religious training, key parts of the mission of any
religious school.</LD>
<LD>   Any parent in a shaky, failing or crowded school district would
welcome the chance for a good alternative. But what if the choice
were only between public and religious schools? The latter are the
schools most likely to accept public vouchers, which provide a paltry
sum compared with the yearly tuition at most independent private
schools. In Cleveland, whose voucher program the high court majority
approved because it allowed students a choice among religious,
secular and even better-rated suburban public schools, the reality is
that 96% of participating students attend religious schools.</LD>
<TE>   As voucher programs expand, as they are certain to under this
ruling, who will oversee the quality of voucher schools? A recent
study of California charter schools, which are a welcome alternative
to regular public schools, found that in districts that did not
rigorously oversee their operations some schools were outright frauds
and others were at best poor money managers. A Fresno charter school
did not pay its teachers for three months. A chain of charter schools
failed to do state-required background checks. Now that religious
schools have, in effect, federal protection, states may be reluctant
to provide, or be constrained from providing, rigorous oversight.</TE>
<TE>   A widespread voucher program would siphon off the involved parents
and striving students who keep up the pressure for progress. No
private schools need accept or keep a student with a troubled
discipline history, increasing the concentration of violent or
disruptive students in public school classes.</TE>
<TE>   Limited voucher programs, triggered by continued failure in a
particular school or schools, have their place. They are a goad, a
sword over the heads of ineffective principals and uncaring
bureaucracies. But voucher proponents, who see the gates opened by
the Supreme Court, envision this sort of choice everywhere and for
all students.</TE>
<TE>   The economic might of the United States was built on universal
public schooling, an egalitarian ideal that sometimes falters in
reality. But if public schools become the refuge of those with no
alternative because their parents are indifferent or they can't get
in elsewhere, a binding force in American life will be lost. Temples,
madrassas and various churches will teach in their preferred ways,
and too many charlatans will find that the religious tent protects
them as well.</TE>

<HD>Mahony: Make Way for a Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So we are now treated to sanctimonious assurances from Cardinal Roger
Mahony in "Healing the Victims and Healing the Church" (Commentary,
June 24).</LD>
<LD>   Where was he years ago, when he became painfully aware that there
were young members of his flock being preyed upon by priests? The
"good" cardinal transferred priests, and they continued their
exploitation of underage parishioners. Then, when called on the
matter by the parents of the victims, he authorized secret payments
to protect the institution from publicity. The cardinal's motivation
has been laid bare for all to see.</LD>
<LD>   During his tenure as cardinal he was faced with this one
significant issue requiring true moral leadership, and such
leadership was nowhere to be found.</LD>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony (and the pope, for that matter) holds himself out
to the world as a moral leader. If one claims the mantle of moral
leadership it is not unreasonable for us, the members of the flock,
to expect such an individual to demonstrate moral leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has failed the parishioners of Los Angeles. He should
apologize for his failings, ask our (and I presume God's) forgiveness
and resign to make room for a leader who may actually be capable of
fulfilling the mission of his high office.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Alvarez</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, in his pastoral letter, said, "I ask for your forgiveness
for not understanding earlier the extent of the problem ... "
("Mahony Asks Forgiveness for Handling of Scandal," June 24). What
part of "sexual abuse of minors" (the cardinal's words from his
commentary the same day) doesn't he understand? Aren't we talking
about someone who, theoretically, is eligible to be elected pope? If
he truly is that out of touch, he owes it to the victims of abuse and
the rest of his flock to move aside and make way for someone with a
moral compass, not a PR firm.</TE>

<LD>Re "Sheriff Baca's Power Play," editorial, June 26: The public knows
who is in charge of providing public safety services directly as well
as indirectly to the 10 million people of Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   The early release of prisoners is not a decision made lightly. It
most assuredly is not a "power play." I do not play politics with the
safety of the people I am committed to protect. I do empathize with
the difficult decisions the Board of Supervisors is facing during
these tough budget times. My immediate goal is to live within my
county budget. It's important to note that of our budget of more than
$1.5 billion, $987 million comes from revenues the Sheriff's
Department generates on behalf of the county through contracts,
Proposition 172 and other sources.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors approved our request for an independent
audit of the budget process as it specifically relates to the
Sheriff's Department. Our hope is that the audit will repair the
budget process by ensuring a stable funding source. The men and women
of the Sheriff's Department continue to be committed to the safety
and security of all the people in L.A. County.</LD>

<LD>Re Joe Loya's cogent remarks in "Rage Behind Bars" (Opinion, June
23): Issues of race and religion have always been at the forefront of
our culture. They define us. Like it or not, in their many
manifestations they are socially and politically a part of our
vernacular and our collective conscience.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, today, identifying with one's oppressors has
increased the number of bad guys (who were once good guys)
exponentially. How easy it has become for society to legitimately
perpetuate this ruse and to avoid the very real and more insidious
problem of "class." Who will be the first to finally have the courage
to address this--and when?</LD>

<LD>Re "WorldCom Says It Inflated Books by $3.9 Billion," June 26:
Massive accounting fraud has probably doomed telecom giant WorldCom
in the same way it sank Enron, Adelphia and Global Crossing. These
instances have sapped investor confidence and vaporized billions of
dollars in personal investment accounts. WorldCom's leaders better
hope that the millions of share owners holding now nearly worthless
stock don't vent their anger by switching carriers.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, all corporate executives who have resorted to fraudulent
accounting better hope investors don't begin to use the integrity of
a company's balance sheet as a factor in making purchase decisions.</LD>

<TE>   Regarding Robert Scheer's June 25 commentary: It is refreshing to
find someone who has the guts to tell it like it is. Although the
focus on terrorists, terrorist acts and threats is essential, we
cannot allow ourselves to be diverted from the corporate boardrooms.
The acts of Tyco, Global Crossing, Adelphia, Enron and now WorldCom
are nothing more than terrorism in corporate America affecting more
lives than anyone is willing to discuss. Bin Laden, Bernard Ebbers,
Kenneth Lay, Dennis Kozlowski--they are all playing the same game. By
the way, have you checked your 401(k) lately?</TE>

<TE>   The "crisis of confidence" enveloping America's business
leadership is long overdue (June 22). Anyone who has been paying
attention over the last 40 years is not at all surprised by this
latest chapter in the long and consistent history of corporate
malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   White-collar defense lawyer Seth Taube's analogy between making up
numbers and robbing a bank misses a simple fact: rob a bank, go to
prison; make up numbers, go to another company. It's an issue of
economic class.</TE>

<LD>I want to publicly thank Los Angeles Police Officers Isaias Ornelas
and Craig Heredia of the Rampart Division for rescuing my 88-year-old
mother and treating her with amazing kindness and compassion. You
truly are "the good guys."</LD>
<LD>   These officers were called by someone (another good Samaritan) to
help my mother--who lives in Palm Springs and had gotten lost while
driving, ending up in Los Angeles. When their shift was over, and I
assume on their own time, they drove my mother and her car home to
Palm Springs. Yes, it appears it's time for Mom to give up her car.</LD>
<LD>   To their credit, these nice men neither chided her nor made her
feel foolish. Instead, they made her feel safe, made sure there was
someone in her life who would help her and left her with the
impression that the LAPD is there to protect and serve.</LD>

<LD>Six people are killed and 16 are injured in an accident caused by a
van full of illegal immigrants and your June 26 headline is "Deaths
of 6 Reignite Border Debate"? What debate? Just because you choose to
interview proponents of illegal immigration does not mean there is a
debate.</LD>
<LD>   Later you refer to the illegal immigrants as "migrants" and
"immigrants" and unbelievably print that "the U.S. crackdown on the
border ... also shares the blame by forcing immigrants away from
easier and safer routes." In other words, let's make it easier and
safer for illegal immigrants to cross the border. This is over the
top!</LD>

<HD>Circuit Court's Ruling on Pledge of Allegiance</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Pledge of Allegiance Violates Constitution, Court Declares," June
27: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was absolutely right in its
ruling on the Pledge of Allegiance. The phrase "under God" belongs
there no more than "under Allah" or "under Isis." Religion is a
private, sacred connection between an individual and his or her God
or gods. Government has no right to intrude in any way on the very
personal choice to worship a divine being or not to worship at all.
Those who are threatening the family that brought the lawsuit are
certainly not living up to the ideals of love and tolerance expressed
in most religions.</LD>
<LD>   The Taliban ran Afghanistan on religious principles, and what a
disaster that was! And finally, we should keep in mind that it was
extreme religious fervor that brought down the World Trade Center.
Separation of church and state is the American way.</LD>

<TE>   Re "A Godforsaken Ruling," editorial, June 27: During World War
II, those of us who were in elementary school recited the Pledge of
Allegiance each day without the phrase "under God," and it would seem
he has greatly blessed our indivisible America, anyway, as we deists
did our praying in private, as it should be done.</TE>

<TE>   In 1864 the motto "In God We Trust" first appeared on our coinage.
In the mid-1960s it first appeared on our paper money, and it's on
many public buildings and historic documents. The ruling about the
pledge is nonsense. No child is required to recite the pledge--only
to stand and be respectful during its recitation. Atheists objected
in 1954 about the additional phrase, and it has stood the test of
time. If the pledge were mandatory or required a signed allegiance,
then maybe it would be unconstitutional.</TE>

<HD>Amgen Pledges $3 Million for Youth Centers</HD>
<DH>Conejo Valley: The biotech firm's gift of cash and matching
funds will help build six Boys &amp; Girls Clubs at middle school
campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. will donate up to $3
million to an effort to build six Boys &amp; Girls Clubs on middle school
campuses in the Conejo Valley, marking what one official says is the
largest single philanthropic gift a local branch of the national
youth organization has ever received.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Bronson Gray, vice president of Amgen Foundation, said the
gift also is the largest donation Amgen has made in the Conejo Valley
since the company's inception 22 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   She said middle-school-aged children are the most underserved in
the community, and many come home from school each day to empty
houses while their parents are at work.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not easy being a teenager these days, with so many
pressures," she said. "We felt this was a smart investment that will
have a huge and lasting impact on kids and their families."</TE>
<TE>   The donation was announced at a press conference Thursday at
Sequoia Middle School in Newbury Park, the site of the first proposed
10,000-square-foot clubhouse that officials hope will open in fall
2004.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen will give the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Conejo and Las Virgenes
$1.5 million upfront toward construction of the first three
clubhouses, which will cost $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Another $1.5 million will be set aside as matching funds to
encourage donations from other businesses, and will be used toward
the project's second, $6-million phase of three more clubhouses.</TE>
<TE>   "A lead gift like this is really what the cause needed to get
started, because it assures us that the first phase will be
successful," said Calabasas developer Cal Johnston, a Thousand Oaks
resident who is chairman of the local group. "The economy and the
stock market make a community effort like this very difficult at this
time, but our kids can't wait."</TE>
<TE>   Johnston started an effort to bring the Boys &amp; Girls Club to the
Conejo Valley last year. The idea came to him after observing many
teenagers and younger kids hanging around shopping malls and parking
lots, he said. But statistics convinced him of the need:</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 37,000 children are enrolled in the Conejo Valley, Las
Virgenes and Oak Park school districts.</TE>
<TE>   About 56% come from families in which both parents work, according
to the 2000 U.S. census.</TE>
<TE>   About 31% live with one parent or guardian, according to the
census.</TE>
<TE>   Unsupervised youth commit 65% of petty crimes in the community
between 3 and 8 p.m., according to the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   No low-cost youth programs exist in the Conejo Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said he hopes the clubs will eventually serve more than
7,000 children annually.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the Boys &amp; Girls Club facilities are planned for Thousand
Oaks, and two will be in either Calabasas, Agoura Hills or Oak Park.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Thousand Oaks has committed $1 million to the cause,
and earlier this month Johnston announced he would contribute up to
$500,000 of his own money.</TE>
<TE>   He promised to match any donation of $1,000 or more from small
business owners as a challenge to local entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   Sequoia was chosen as the first club site mainly because it had
readily available space for a clubhouse on land in front of the
school that once housed a library, said Bob Gross, development
director for the Conejo Valley club.</TE>
<TE>   Los Cerritos Middle School in Thousand Oaks will be the second
location, and the other four sites are yet to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Sequoia Principal Michael Berger said his school is a good first
choice also because it has the highest percentage of students
receiving free or reduced-cost lunches out of the Conejo Valley's
four middle schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Boys &amp; Girls Club--with a $15 to $20 annual membership
fee--will serve those children who cannot afford the after-school
homework programs offered by the park district for $200 a month,
Berger said.</TE>
<TE>   Boys &amp; Girls Clubs began in urban centers and have long been
associated with poor, inner-city kids. But in recent years, the clubs
have moved toward small towns and wealthy suburbs such as Thousand
Oaks, said Ron Moeckel, regional service director for the Boys &amp;
Girls Clubs of America.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Amgen gift is a record amount for the national
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we are an upscale community, there are thousands of
kids who could fall through the cracks," Johnston said. "If we lose
just a few kids for not having an after-school place to go, we lose
those kids forever."</TE>
<TE>   The Amgen Foundation donates about $8 million each year to a
variety of causes.</TE>

<HD>J. Berwanger, 88; Won First Heisman Trophy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay Berwanger, the first in a long line of Heisman Trophy winners as
college football's 1935 player of the year, died Wednesday night of
lung cancer at his home in Oak Brook, Ill., a Chicago suburb. He was
88.</LD>
<LD>   Berwanger, who played halfback at the University of Chicago
shortly before the school dropped football, was the first player
drafted by the National Football League, but he never played the pro
game.</LD>
<LD>   "There was no money in pro football then," he said a few years
ago. "Remember, that was during the Great Depression. I thought I'd
have a better future by using my education rather than my football
skills."</LD>
<TE>   Berwanger learned that he had been drafted when he read about it
in a newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know there was a draft going on," he told the
Hartford Courant in 1994. "I think Bronko Nagurski was the highest
paid and he was getting about $7,000. It wasn't until years later
when [Charley] Trippi signed with the [Chicago] Cardinals for
$100,000 for three years. My timing was all wrong, but I don't feel
cheated. I've had a great life."</TE>
<TE>   He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles, who offered him $125 to
$150 a game. Later, the Chicago Bears obtained the rights to
Berwanger, who loved to tell of a chance meeting with George Halas,
founder-owner-coach of the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   "I met him in the lobby of a hotel where I was with a date. He
asked me what I wanted. When I told him, 'Two years, 25, no cut,'
meaning $25,000 for two years [and a guaranteed contract], he tipped
his hat to my date and said, 'Have a good night.' That was it."</TE>
<TE>   At Chicago, the 6-foot, 195-pound Berwanger ran, passed, punted,
blocked and kicked extra points on offense, played halfback on
defense, and returned punts and kickoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, Berwanger is the wrong answer to the question, "Who
was the first Heisman Trophy winner?" Larry Kelley, a Yale end, won
the first award so designated in 1936. When Berwanger was honored, it
was called the Downtown Athletic Club Award, after the New York
organization presenting it.</TE>
<TE>   John Heisman, a famous football coach, died in October 1936, and
the award then was renamed for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think of myself as the first, kind of like being George
Washington," Berwanger once said.</TE>
<TE>   He was notified of his selection by telegram, which said the
Downtown Athletic Club would send him two airplane tickets, one for
himself and one for his coach, to a luncheon in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest thrill wasn't getting the award, it was the fact that
it was going to be my first ride on an airplane," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He gave the trophy to his aunt, who used it for years as a
doorstop before Berwanger reconsidered and gave it to the University
of Chicago, where it is in storage until a new athletic center is
completed. A replica trophy is on display at his high school in his
hometown of Dubuque, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "I only wish I had a third trophy, so I could give it to my grade
school," he once said.</TE>
<TE>   The highlights of his football career were an 85-yard touchdown
run against Ohio State, and a punt-return touchdown and the kicked
extra-point in a 7-6 victory over Illinois. Against Minnesota he made
15 solo tackles.</TE>
<TE>   Berwanger's first coach at Chicago was the legendary Amos Alonzo
Stagg, who after a season was succeeded by Clark Shaughnessy, famous
as the creator of the T-formation. Four years after Berwanger
graduated, Chicago dropped football.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his gridiron exploits, Berwanger was captain of the
track team and senior class president before graduating in 1936. He
was expected to be a candidate for the U.S. Olympic team in the
decathlon but declined to try out because training would have
interfered with his studies.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating, he became a foam-rubber salesman and later
founded Jay Berwanger Inc., a manufacturer of plastic and
sponge-rubber strips for car doors and farm machinery. He also
briefly wrote a sports column for the Chicago Daily News, and
officiated college football games--he was the field judge for the
1949 Rose Bowl game between Northwestern and California (Berkeley).
During World War II, he was a naval aviator.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the Heisman Trophy selection committee, Berwanger
took his duties seriously and tried to see as many candidates as
possible each season.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's players are fine young men and at least 100 pounds bigger
than I was," he said while attending last year's Heisman Trophy
presentation. "There have been a lot of changes in football, but I
still love every aspect of the game.</TE>

<HD>Blake Bail Hearing to Wait Until Evidence Is Unveiled,
Judge Rules</HD>
<DH>Court: He also rejects a defense bid to strike the special
circumstance allegation of lying in wait in the slaying of the
actor's wife.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge ruled Thursday that a bail hearing for actor
Robert Blake should wait until evidence is presented on whether the
actor was lying in wait to kill his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash said he would consider a bail
request for Blake, who maintains his innocence, after a preliminary
hearing later this year.</LD>
<LD>   Nash also rejected Blake's lawyer's motion to strike the special
circumstance allegation that has kept the 68-year-old defendant in
Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles since his April 18 arrest
at his daughter's home in Hidden Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, was fatally shot on May 4,
2001, as she sat in Blake's car near a Studio City restaurant where
they had dined.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun, has accused prosecutors of
charging Blake with capital murder for the sole purpose of preventing
him from being released on bail.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he will appeal Nash's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said Deputy Dist. Attys. Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory A.
Dohi lack physical evidence and eyewitnesses to link Blake to his
wife's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said the prosecutors are confident they can prove Blake's guilt. "We
think we have a very good case," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, who starred in the 1970s television series "Baretta," has
pleaded not guilty to murder and two counts of soliciting murder and
conspiracy with the special circumstance of lying in wait. He faces
life in prison without parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, 46, who is charged with
conspiring with Blake to kill Bakley, has pleaded not guilty and
faces life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   He was released from jail in April after Blake posted his
$1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Nash set an Aug. 27 hearing to schedule a preliminary hearing.</TE>

<HD>Tenant's Action Led to Apartment Blast, Probe Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Fire Department investigation has concluded that a
tenant's attempt to repair a natural gas stove in an Encino apartment
building caused an explosion and fire last month in which he was
killed.</LD>
<LD>   The conclusion, based on a monthlong probe of the incident, is
contained in a fire investigation report released Thursday by the
department's Arson Investigation Section.</LD>
<LD>   After the incident at the Park Encino apartment complex at 5325
Newcastle Ave., tenant Dennis Cohen told authorities he had
disconnected a gas line in his unit and soon thereafter lighted a
cigarette.</LD>
<TE>   Cohen suffered burns over 55% of his body and died of his injuries
at Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks two days after the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The fire caused $5 million in damage to the building and its
contents, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the opinion of this investigator that, based on the
physical evidence ... the valve line handle was left open, allowing
gas to continue flowing for a sustained period of time," wrote LAFD
Arson Investigator Glen G. Lucero.</TE>
<TE>   "This created an ideal gas-to-air explosive ratio," he added. "An
undetermined open flame or spark was then introduced into the
atmosphere, resulting in the explosion and fire."</TE>
<TE>   The blast caused the total collapse of the complex's west
recreation room and two units directly above on the second and third
floors, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse severely diminished the structural integrity of the
surrounding units.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department sent investigators
and bomb technicians to the site.</TE>
<TE>   Accelerant-sniffing dogs brought to the scene did not detect
anything unusual, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten units in one wing were destroyed and dozens of others were
damaged.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 people were displaced. No residents have been allowed
back into the building.</TE>

<HD>Idaho Man Is Named as a Kidnap Victim</HD>
<DH>Law: Businessman was abducted after trying to hire two
Valley men charged in ransom plot that killed five people, federal
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Idaho man in the market for a pair of killers tried to hire two
men now charged in an alleged Los Angeles-area kidnapping plot--and
ended up being kidnapped himself, federal authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Twin Falls businessman Armen Gyurdzhiyants, 25, met with Iouri
Mikhel of Encino and Jurijus Kadamovas of Sherman Oaks in November to
discuss killing an undercover law enforcement officer who had helped
arrest Gyurdzhiyants' brother in a drug sting, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the two men decided to kidnap Gyurdzhiyants, holding him
until relatives paid an undisclosed amount as ransom, U.S. attorney's
spokesman Thom Mrozek said.</LD>
<TE>   Kadamovas, Mikhel and three other suspects are facing possible
death sentences for their alleged roles in a scheme that federal
authorities say involved snatching five Los Angeles residents,
extorting money from their relatives, then killing the abductees and
dumping them in a Northern California lake.</TE>
<TE>   All five suspects have pleaded not guilty to federal charges of
conspiracy and kidnapping resulting in death. Mrozek would not say if
Mikhel and Kadamovas will face additional charges for allegedly
abducting the Idaho businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Gyurdzhiyants was in federal court in Boise on Thursday, where he
was arraigned for trying to arrange the hit.</TE>
<TE>   Gyurdzhiyants' brother Robert was also arraigned on a
murder-for-hire charge, which was contained in a federal grand jury
indictment. Both men also were charged with conspiracy to distribute
methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Gyurdzhiyants, who has been in custody since October, is
facing separate firearms and drug charges.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers pleaded not guilty to all charges and are being held
without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Armen Gyurdzhiyants' girlfriend, Wendy Powell of Twin Falls, said
authorities had "turned the victim into the criminal."</TE>
<TE>   She said her boyfriend had traveled to Los Angeles on legitimate
business in November. Until recently, he had operated a trucking
business and a video duplication firm, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Gyurdzhiyants, Mikhel and Kadamovas declined to
comment.</TE>

<HD>Clock Is Ticking on Budget Debate</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: Davis administration says it can't release
millions to counties until fiscal package is in place. Foes lay blame
on governor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' administration said Thursday that it could not
legally make millions of dollars in payments to counties for welfare
and other social programs until a state budget is passed.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement was seen by some as a preemptive strike to
pressure lawmakers into passing a budget by Monday, the start of the
fiscal year. But some lawmakers said it is Davis who needs to act, by
jump-starting budget negotiations and caring for the poor.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Republican Floor Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga
described the announcement as a "political tactic."</LD>
<TE>   "If the Davis administration really believes that that is the
current state of the law, I think it makes it even more incumbent on
the governor to sit down and begin negotiations so we can reach a
bipartisan agreement on the budget," Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) said of the
administration's contention that it can't forward money to the
counties: "Unless they're legally, by judges, prohibited from doing
it, as far as I'm concerned I'm not going to discuss their issues
until they take care of the poor people."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement Thursday came from the California Department of
Social Services, which said no state or federal funds will be
advanced to counties for programs not mandated by federal law unless
a new budget is in place. Money the counties are supposed to receive
for July already is being affected.</TE>
<TE>   A $245-million payment was supposed to be sent out today to
counties for CalWORKs, a welfare-to-work program, and two other
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Another payment at stake for counties is $96 million for Child
Welfare Services and Adult Protective Services and other programs,
which is due by July 5.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Harper, chief deputy of Los Angeles County's chief
administrative office, said the county is examining how long it can
continue to provide services given the state's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We have funds available, but not for an extended period of time,"
Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   The executive director of the County Welfare Directors Assn. of
California, Frank Mecca, said smaller counties could be in trouble
quickly. "As the money they're counting on does not materialize and
the total increases, you increase the risks counties will curtail
services and potentially not pay recipients their benefits."</TE>
<TE>   The County Counsels' Assn. of California sent a letter to the
social services department objecting to the decision.</TE>
<TE>   The association also warned that if the department persisted in
its position that counties must continue to make public assistance
payments, many of them would have no choice but to only pay the
county's share.</TE>
<TE>   That action, the letter warned, probably would result in
litigation against the counties, which the state could get dragged
into.</TE>
<TE>   By Thursday afternoon, there appeared to be confusion in the Davis
administration over the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Saenz, director of the social services department, said that
the change in policy is the result of a review her department
conducted after an appeals court ruled last month that if the budget
isn't approved by June 30, the state cannot distribute money to
schools or pay full salaries to more than 200,000 state workers. That
court decision isn't final, and a petition for a rehearing is
pending.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in an adversarial relationship with the counties,"
Saenz said. "If we could pay them, we would."</TE>
<TE>   Saenz said her department even submitted a request to Controller
Kathleen Connell's office to cut checks to the counties.</TE>
<TE>   A statement released later by the social services department said
that, after consulting with the controller's office, it believed it
had no authority to make the advance payments to the counties.</TE>
<TE>   But Rick Chivaro, the controller's chief counsel, said his office
was never consulted.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most bizarre situation I have ever seen," Chivaro
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Cain, a political science professor at UC Berkeley's
Institute of Governmental Studies, said the Davis administration's
actions appear to be an attempt to pressure Republican legislators by
demonstrating that failing to pass a state budget on time will affect
people.</TE>
<TE>   "The tactic here is to call their bluff and say, 'Their
obstructionism is apparent, and these are real state services that
are going to be affected,' " Cain said. "How do you illustrate that?
You do it by turning off the water."</TE>

<HD>I.W. 'Tubby' Burnham, 93; Founded Securities Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I.W. "Tubby" Burnham, who founded Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the
securities firm that later collapsed after junk-bond trader Michael
Milken was jailed for securities fraud, died Monday of a heart attack
on his yacht off the Virginia coast. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Burnham was born in Baltimore, earning the nickname "Tubby" as a
teenager after his parents fattened him up as part of a recovery from
typhoid fever. He later lost the weight, and was captain of the
lacrosse team while at the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1931.</LD>
<LD>   His Wall Street career began soon after at Burnham Herman &amp; Co., a
firm managed by his uncle, where he was paid $20 a week.</LD>
<TE>   Burnham formed his own brokerage firm, Burnham &amp; Co., in 1935. A
veteran of World War II, Burnham served as a pilot and base commander
in the Civil Air Patrol and was later stationed in the Pacific as a
lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Burnham's firm became Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1973 when the firm
acquired the assets of Drexel Firestone.</TE>
<TE>   He convinced Milken, then of Drexel Firestone, to stay on after
the purchase. Years later, as Milken built up the firm's junk-bond
business, Burnham, who remained a director of the firm after stepping
down as chief executive officer in 1973 and chairman in 1984, warned
that the firm might run into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Drexel filed for bankruptcy in 1990, two years after pleading
guilty to charges of insider trading and stock manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Drexel was liquidated in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Burnham is survived by his son; daughter Wendy Burnham Morris;
seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Cajon Pass Wildfire Destroys 3 Homes, Chars 6,200 Acres</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Officials report 30% containment but see signs that
it is no longer out of control. California 138 remains closed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMAN and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wildfire that blackened more than 6,200 acres and destroyed three
homes and two outbuildings in rugged Cajon Pass backcountry showed
signs of subsiding late Thursday, as winds calmed and once-towering
flames began to recede.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze was 30% contained by 9:30 p.m., "and it's looking pretty
good," said Jolene Sassano, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest
Service. Few visible flames could be seen by the late evening,
although fire crews continued to scour for hot spots, she said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire had forced the closures of Interstate 15 and California
138 after it started Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, California 138
remained closed between Mormon Rocks and Interstate 15, but
Interstate 15 reopened.</LD>
<TE>   The Forest Service marshaled more than 1,400 firefighters, 196
fire engines, six bulldozers, eight air tankers and 10 water-dropping
helicopters to fight the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   There were no reports of injuries. But Carol Beckley, another
spokeswoman for the Forest Service, said residents of isolated ranch
homes in the Cajon Valley had been ordered to evacuate earlier
Thursday and weren't allowed back by nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen evacuees took refuge at an American Red Cross center
in Phelan, a Mojave Desert community about eight miles northwest of
the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold and Diann Fulp, who live beside California 138 in the west
Cajon Valley, said they left their home about 8 p.m. Wednesday,
returned about 2:15 a.m. Thursday when the fire seemed to be turning
away, and then left again that afternoon when the flames headed
toward them a second time.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'No. We just got home. How can this be?' " Diann Fulp
said. "Then, all of a sudden, the fire burst over that last ridge and
boy, we didn't hesitate. We took off."</TE>
<TE>   Raul and Barbara Aguilera live with their cat, Cuddlebug, in a
small tent beside their car in the Lost Lake area. Firefighters
warned them to get out Wednesday night as a wall of flames advanced
on the campground.</TE>
<TE>   "It's off the map, now," Raul Aguilera said. "It's gone."</TE>
<TE>   The blaze apparently was started by a car fire Wednesday afternoon
on the shoulder of Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass.</TE>
<TE>   Flames spread quickly, forcing the closure of Interstate 15, the
principal route between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Freight traffic
was halted on rail lines operated by the Union Pacific and Burlington
Northern Santa Fe. The flames damaged major power lines, cutting off
electricity to about 450,000 customers in San Bernardino, Riverside
and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   By 8 a.m. Thursday, the fire had moved north and west, away from
the pass. Interstate 15 reopened, rail traffic resumed and power was
restored to all but a few customers. But the advancing flames halted
traffic on California 138, which links the Cajon Pass and the
Antelope Valley, and Beckley said several homes were threatened in
Swarthout and Lone Pine canyons.</TE>
<TE>   By evening, the fire was at least five miles from Wrightwood and
posed no immediate threat to the community, Beckley said. A town
meeting was held Thursday night at the Wrightwood Community Building
to reassure residents and update them on the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the blaze is known as the Louisiana Fire, not
because of any geographical ties but because the Forest Service this
year is naming fires in the San Bernardino National Forest after
states. The list is alphabetical; this is the 12th fire this year.</TE>

<HD>Conflict-of-Interest Allegations Probed by D.A.'s Office</HD>
<DH>El Monte: Councilman Thurston's votes in favor of two
contracts for companies that employed him are being investigated,
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles district attorney's office is investigating whether
an El Monte councilman violated a state conflict-of-interest law
during the last year when he voted on two separate contracts for his
employers, law enforcement sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators with the district attorney's Public Integrity Unit
are examining Jack Thurston's employment at an El Monte car
dealership last July and at a South El Monte towing company since
April, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Thurston denies any wrongdoing, saying that in both cases his
employment was unrelated to the votes. He said he has not been
contacted by investigators.</LD>
<TE>   "I am always careful to avoid conflicts of interest," said the
councilman, reached at the towing company.</TE>
<TE>   Thurston received a state license July 16 to sell vehicles at a
local Hyundai dealership, records show. The next day, Thurston voted
to approve an agreement between the city and his new boss that
provided exclusive rights to negotiate with the city for some prime
real estate occupied by homes and businesses for a possible
dealership expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Thurston, 66, quit the job after working at the dealership for a
month and receiving a commission and two paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   The 11-year councilman began working in April at Freddie Mac's
Towing Inc. On April 2, Thurston voted with the council majority in a
3-2 decision to award the towing company a contract to provide towing
services for the El Monte police. Thurston said that he was
approached after that vote to work at the company and took a job as a
dispatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said the office would not discuss any ongoing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Motor Vehicles officials said Thurston sought and
received a license to work as a car salesman for the parent company
of Famous Ed's Hyundai on July 16.</TE>
<TE>   On July 17, the City Council, sitting as the redevelopment agency
board, approved a contract to give Scott Gunderson exclusive rights
to negotiate with the city to obtain a four- to six-acre site north
of the San Bernardino Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Gunderson was seeking the city's help to expand
Famous Ed's, which he owns with partner Ed Dominguez. He also wanted
to relocate his Scott Pontiac GMC dealership, on Valley Boulevard,
next to Famous Ed's on Santa Anita Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Thurston said he began work at the Hyundai dealership on July 21,
four days after the council approved the agreement with Gunderson.
According to Thurston, he consulted with the city attorney and was
told he could vote. Dominguez said he was trying to help out a person
who wanted a job and it had nothing to do with the request before the
council.</TE>
<TE>   California's Government Code 1090 forbids public officials from
being "financially interested in any contract made by them in their
official capacity." City officers with financial interests in a
contract are not to vote or participate in a contract decision.</TE>
<TE>   Those convicted of violating the law can be thrown out of office.
Municipal lawyers say agreements for exclusive negotiations--such as
the one the El Monte City Council approved--are considered contracts
that fall within the provisions of that law.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Wilson told The
Times last year in a story on Thurston's employment that under the
law, a "financial interest" isn't narrowly defined as a payment to a
public official. He said the expectation of employment can generate a
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson has since been assigned to examine Thurston's action,
documents show.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was in part prompted by a complaint filed with
prosecutors by El Monte School Board member Ed Wallach, husband of
former Mayor Patricia Wallach. "Who does he represent, the city or
his employers?" Wallach said.</TE>
<TE>   David Demejian, the deputy district attorney who heads the Public
Integrity Unit, recently wrote to Wallach confirming the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac Towing served the city along with Albert's Tow until
2001, when the El Monte police decided to go with one firm because of
a lack of work.</TE>
<TE>   When Police Chief Kenneth Weldon took over the department, he
recommended rehiring Freddie Mac's Towing and splitting the city. On
April 2, with Thurston providing the key vote, Freddie Mac won the
right to tow vehicles in the southern part of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, plans to expand the car dealership have changed.</TE>
<TE>   Gunderson is continuing to work with the city to expand his
dealerships at the site, bordered on the west by Santa Anita Avenue
and on the east by Granada Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Plans now call for the project to take one house on the Santa
Anita Avenue side of the project instead of 12 or more on Granada
Avenue.</TE>

<HD>Cypress Church Backers Try to Force Property Referendum</HD>
<DH>Law: Nearly 5,000 signatures are submitted after the city
condemned the congregation's land to pave the way for a revenue-rich
Costco.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Cypress citizens group on Wednesday turned in petitions with nearly
5,000 signatures in an effort to force a referendum that could stop
the city from taking 18 acres of prime redevelopment property from a
church and selling it to Costco.</LD>
<LD>   The bid for a citywide vote on the controversial chunk of land is
the latest episode in the drama between Cypress officials and
Cottonwood Christian Center, a dispute that has drawn national
attention. The conflict pits a city's redevelopment efforts and
thirst for tax revenue against property rights and religious freedom.</LD>
<LD>   Cypress City Atty. Bill Wynder said the proposed referendum may
not be eligible for the ballot, even if the group gathered the
necessary 2,300 signatures. Eminent domain actions that force the
sale of land, unlike routine council votes, are not subject to the
referendum process, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not terribly worried," Wynder said. "It's part of [the
church's] grand strategy to attack the city through as many
surrogates as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Cottonwood church attorneys filed a request for
a preliminary injunction in federal court to prevent the city from
condemning the property at Katella Avenue and Walker Street, near the
Los Alamitos Race Course.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens for Property Rights, made up mostly of Cottonwood
congregants who live in Cypress, was formed after the City Council
voted unanimously last month to condemn the undeveloped site, where
the 4,000-member church planned a sprawling complex.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the new committee disagree with the city attorney's
opinion on the legality of a special election, saying there is
nothing in the state code that exempts condemnation from voters'
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The city doesn't believe in private property rights," said Scott
Aanonson, a spokesman for the citizens committee. "Hopefully, they'll
respect our right to vote."</TE>
<TE>   Committee members said about 250 volunteers, along with five paid
workers, collected 4,760 signatures throughout the city over the last
three weeks. They also mailed fliers to 12,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Wynder also said he'll question the validity of the
petitions themselves, because activists, in presenting them to
voters, attached only the eminent domain resolution passed by the
council and not all the supporting reference material.</TE>
<TE>   However, residents accused the city of purposely dragging its feet
in giving them the 60 pages of material, which came about a week
after it was requested. And working under a 30-day deadline, they
simply couldn't wait on the city. Thursday was the last day to turn
in the signatures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just outrageous," said Mark W. Bucher, an attorney and
committee member. "They refused to give us the material in a timely
fashion, and then they want to throw out the petitions because we
don't have that material."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Bucher said city officials should not try to find

<HD>Cypress Petitions Seek Vote on Church</HD>
<DH>Land use: Nearly 5,000 signatories seek a ballot referendum
to nullify the city's condemnation of a congregation's land with
plans for a Costco.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Cypress citizens group on Wednesday turned in petitions with nearly
5,000 signatures in an effort to force a referendum that could stop
the city from taking 18 acres of prime redevelopment property from a
church and selling it to Costco.</LD>
<LD>   The bid for a citywide vote on the controversial chunk of land is
the latest episode in the drama between Cypress officials and
Cottonwood Christian Center, a dispute that has drawn national
attention. The conflict pits a city's redevelopment efforts and
thirst for tax revenue against property rights and religious
expression.</LD>
<LD>   Cypress City Atty. Bill Wynder said the proposed referendum may
not be eligible for the ballot, even if the group gathered the
necessary 2,300 signatures. Eminent domain actions that force the
sale of land, unlike routine council votes, aren't subject to the
referendum process, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not terribly worried," Wynder said. "It's part of [the
church's] grand strategy to attack the city through as many
surrogates as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Cottonwood church attorneys filed a request for
a preliminary injunction in federal court to prevent the city from
condemning the property, at Katella Avenue and Walker Street, near
the Los Alamitos Race Course.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens for Property Rights, made up mostly of Cottonwood
congregants who live in Cypress, was formed after the City Council
unanimously voted last month to condemn the undeveloped site, where
the 4,000-member church planned a sprawling complex.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the new committee disagree with the city attorney's
opinion on whether a special election can be held, saying there's
nothing in the state code that exempts condemnation from voters'
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The city doesn't believe in private property rights," said Scott
Aanonson, a spokesman for the citizens committee. "Hopefully, they'll
respect our right to vote."</TE>
<TE>   Committee members said about 250 volunteers, along with five paid
workers, collected 4,760 signatures throughout the city over the past
three weeks. They also mailed a flier to 12,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Wynder also said he'll question the validity of the
petitions themselves, because activists, in presenting them to
voters, attached only the eminent domain resolution passed by the
council and not all the supporting reference material.</TE>
<TE>   However, residents accused the city of purposely dragging its feet
in giving them the 60 pages of material, which came about a week
after it was requested. And working under a 30-day deadline, they
simply couldn't wait on the city. Thursday was the last day to turn
in the signatures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just outrageous," said Mark W. Bucher, an attorney and
committee member. "They refused to give us the material in a timely
fashion, and then they want to throw out the petitions because we
don't have that material."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Bucher said city officials shouldn't try to find
legal means to fight the referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "If they try to stand on a legal technicality, they are slapping
the nearly 5,000 voters in the face who signed this petition."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Tim Keenan said the ballot box isn't the proper
way to solve such problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that what these folks are doing is politics," Keenan
said. "They've raised serious money. Are we going to work to resolve
the issue, or are we going to play politics?"</TE>
<TE>   Committee leaders declined to specify their finances but said
they'll report them by the next required deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the lawsuits and petition drives, city officials and church
leaders have been looking elsewhere in Cypress for property that
might suit Cottonwood.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Keenan said the church's tactics have cost it goodwill in
the city. If the issue came up for a vote, "I feel confident that the
church would get run out of town on a rail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About the only thing city officials and Cottonwood supporters
agree on is that no precedent exists in state law on whether eminent
domain decisions can be appealed by referendum, and the outcome of
all the legal maneuvers will be watched throughout the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Says John Fugatt, executive director of the California Christian
Coalition, a Santa Ana-based group that helps churches and others in
political battles, "So far in the U.S., there has not been a case
where a city basically steals a church's land for commercial use."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Smoller, chairman of Chapman University's political science
department, said it's easy to see why the controversy has grabbed so
much attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Eminent domain is always going to be problematic," Smoller said.
"And then you add a religious element to it, and you'll get an
uproar."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Supervisors Will Meet Today on D.A. Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Allegations: Board will study grand jury findings but has
little authority over office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a rare special session, the Orange County Board of Supervisors
today will examine grand jury allegations that Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas intervened in cases involving campaign contributors.</LD>
<LD>   But the board lacks the authority to make major changes in the
operations of the district attorney's office and can't even force him
to implement the panel's recommendations.</LD>
<LD>   District attorney is an independent elective post, established
under the state Constitution to be separate from the rest of county
government. The board approves the district attorney's annual budget,
sets his salary and can order audits of the office's finances and
operations. Many said Thursday that the strongest action supervisors
could take would be to censure Rackauckas.</LD>
<TE>   But because much of the district attorney's budget is earmarked
for specific programs such as gang and drug prosecutions, the board
would have little discretion in waving its budget pencil. Board
efforts in the past to force changes from independently elected
officials have yielded mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   "This speaks to the incredible dilemma faced by everyone from the
board to the whole county," said Newport Beach lawyer William R.
Mitchell, former director of Orange County Common Cause. "The grand
jury is a credible organization. It's saying [Rackauckas is] a poor
administrator and engages in extreme favoritism. There's nothing
anyone can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury report accuses the district attorney of political
cronyism, using public resources for personal business and hiring
relatives of political supporters over more qualified candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said that the report is full of inaccuracies and that
it was motivated by political enemies. He vowed to respond in detail
to each allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Several supervisors expressed alarm about the allegations but have
not indicated what action--if any--they plan to take. Rackauckas has
60 days under law to address the findings and recommendations.
Supervisors said earlier this week that they also will respond to the
jury's recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Issuing a censure would be a symbolic gesture that nonetheless
might carry some sting. Supervisors did just that in 1994 with
then-Recorder Lee A. Branch, who was removed by voters later that
year.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors also could yank the authority it granted Rackauckas in
1999 to allow his top managers to serve "at will" under his control
rather than being subject to civil service protections. The jury
report recommended stripping Rackauckas of hiring authority after
what it called a history of favoritism. But it is unlikely that the
board could strip him of those powers.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state attorney general's office--which helped
produce the grand jury report--said officials haven't decided whether
to pursue a criminal investigation of Rackauckas or anyone on his
staff identified in the report.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said state prosecutors would probably pursue charges
only if there was evidence of an extraordinary misuse of office
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a line between inappropriate behavior and criminal
behavior," said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in
Los Angeles. "In a criminal case, the behavior has to be pretty
egregious."</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury spent eight months investigating the district
attorney's office, aided by Deputy Atty. Gen. James Dutton. The
resulting report found that Rackauckas and his staff violated county
and office policies and repeatedly acted with an appearance of
impropriety, including intervening in at least three criminal cases
on behalf of political contributors. However, the report didn't
accuse anyone of criminal wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said the panel bought into lies told by disgruntled
employees who were passed over for management jobs when he
reorganized the office in 1999. Many of the allegations were aired
during Rackauckas' reelection campaign earlier this year by his
challenger, Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally Wade. Rackauckas won in a
landslide.</TE>
<TE>   "I see this as a clean start," Rackauckas said this week. "I feel
very good about the team we have in place and the entire group of
deputy district attorneys and investigators."</TE>
<TE>   Wade said the jury's report warrants a criminal inquiry. Among its
findings was that county resources were used for personal and
campaign activities--illegal under state law--including an
investigator being sent to Riverside County to find out if
Rackauckas' son was driving with a suspended license.</TE>

for personal and campaign activities--illegal under state
law--including an investigator being sent to Riverside County to
determine whether Rackauckas' son was driving with a suspended
license.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the grand jury questioned whether Donald Blankenship,
chief of the office's Bureau of Investigation, was reimbursed twice
for meals and drinks by the county and from a special office fund to
be used for crime-gathering expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The board hasn't found success in bending the will of the district
attorney in the past. After the county's 1994 bankruptcy, Dist. Atty.
Mike Capizzi filed civil misconduct charges against two supervisors,
who later supported an audit of the office. The audit, however, ended
up largely praising the district attorney's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Branch, then the clerk-recorder, first came under fire in 1985
after a scathing audit of his office. With little authority over him,
supervisors in 1986 took away half his job, appointing Branch as
recorder and Gary Granville as clerk. In 1988, they froze Branch's
salary; in 1994, they officially censured him after allegations of
sexual harassment. Later that year, a grand jury report criticized
Branch for mismanagement, spurring supervisors to rejoin the
clerk-recorder's office. That allowed Granville to successfully
challenge Branch for the seat.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Deacon Sentenced in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Abuse: South El Monte church leader is given one-year term
for activities with two boys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Catholic deacon who worked at a South El Monte church was sentenced
to a year in Los Angeles County Jail and given a 44-month suspended
state prison term Thursday for providing pornographic material to two
boys and sexually battering one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Arturo Ahumada, a deacon at Epiphany Catholic Church, was also
placed on felony probation for five years by Pomona Court
Commissioner Wade Olson.</LD>
<LD>   "He will be registered as a sex offender. That will ensure
wherever he goes, people in the neighborhood will know he is a danger
to children," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Habib Balian.</LD>
<TE>   "He used his position with the church to take advantage of those
most vulnerable in society: children."</TE>
<TE>   Ahumada, 46, pleaded no contest March 4 to two felony counts of
providing illicit materials to minors and one count of misdemeanor
sexual battery on a boy. He has been suspended from his church duties
since his arrest last year.</TE>
<TE>   Balian said Ahumada invited two boys, ages 15 and 16, to his home
several times for dinner between March 1 and March 31 last year. He
showed them a pornographic videotape, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had requested a state prison sentence for the deacon.
Olson, however, noting Ahumada's lack of prior offenses, said a year
in County Jail and a requirement that he attend special therapy for
abusive behavior was appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Before sentencing, one boy's mother and father addressed Ahumada
and the court, expressing disgust with the deacon's betrayal of their
trust, according to the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Albert Maldonado of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department's Family Crimes Unit said Ahumada used his position with
the church to befriend the boys.</TE>
<TE>   Maldonado, who investigated the case, said one of the boys told a
high school guidance counselor, who then reported the sexual abuse to
the Sheriff's Department. Sheriff's detectives arrested Ahumada last
July.</TE>
<TE>   Ahumada was taken into custody May 24 at a hearing in which
sentencing was postponed. Since June 11 he has been assigned to the
jail hospital because of unspecified medical problems.</TE>

<HD>Burbank Physician, 88, Surrenders His Medical License</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Burbank physician has surrendered his medical license to the
Medical Board of California following accusations of incompetence,
negligence and fraud.</LD>
<LD>   By surrendering his license, Jack Eglin, 88, is barred
indefinitely from practicing medicine in the state, board spokeswoman
Candis Cohen said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The action becomes effective on July 5. Eglin could not be reached
for comment.</LD>
<TE>   According to a complaint filed by the state attorney general's
office, Eglin in 1990 placed his license on retired status, which
allowed him to see patients free of charge or for reduced fees
provided his annual income did not make him ineligible for Social
Security benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, however, Eglin has had a family medicine practice in
Burbank under the retired license, treating about 200 patients and
earning about $10,000 monthly.</TE>
<TE>   Also since 1999, Eglin has billed Medi-Cal about $1 million for
patient services allegedly rendered by him but actually performed by
a physician assistant, according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   When asked for the name of his assistant, Eglin could only
identify him as an "African guy," the complaint states.</TE>
<TE>   "The medical board took this action because the doctor was billing
Medi-Cal inappropriately," Deputy Atty. Gen. Sanford Feldman said.
"He was not properly supervising his physician assistant and was
practicing beyond the limits of his retired license status."</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't allege patient harm," Feldman said. "We alleged he was
grossly negligent in the way he ran his business."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 49 physicians surrendered their licenses and 39
licenses were revoked by the state medical board, Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Eglin may petition for reinstatement in three years if he can show
he has corrected his wrongdoings, she said.</TE>

<HD>Flynn May Seek 8th Term Despite Vow to Latinos</HD>
<DH>Supervisors: Many Oxnard political leaders in the county
official's district feel it's time for a change after 26 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reneging on an earlier pledge to Oxnard's Latino leaders, Ventura
County Supervisor John Flynn said Thursday he "still has fire in the
belly" and will very likely seek reelection for an eighth term.</LD>
<LD>   "If I do change my mind, it won't be the first time," said Flynn,
69, who has held the Oxnard-based office for 26 years. "If it means
violating the pledge, then that's what it means."</LD>
<LD>   Flynn is midway through a seventh term. Another run in 2004 would
most likely galvanize a core of top Oxnard political leaders, many of
them Latino, who believe it's time for a change in the 5th
Supervisorial District. Latinos make up 65% of the district.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a desire for a Latino supervisor in that district, no
question about it," said Hank Lacayo, former chairman of the county's
Democratic Party and outgoing president of El Concilio, a Latino
advocacy group. "It's not a secret. But they have to pick a person
who Latinos may go for."</TE>
<TE>   One contender could be Oxnard Councilman John Zaragoza, who said
he has been approached several times about running for the position
and "has not ruled it out."</TE>
<TE>   Other names frequently cited are Francisco Dominguez, who
unsuccessfully challenged Flynn in his last election, community
college district trustee Art Hernandez and Jess Herrera, a Port of
Hueneme commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Several community leaders said Flynn promised during the 2000
election to step down midterm and hand his seat to Herrera. Flynn
acknowledged making the statement but said, "It was on the spur of
the moment; I'm not going to step down."</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of another Flynn run comes in the wake of a messy
public feud between the supervisor and Irma Lopez, an influential
fund-raiser and wife of Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez filed a police report Monday contending Flynn had verbally
threatened her at a Democratic Party barbecue last weekend. Lopez
said Flynn shouted, "I'm gonna get you!" as she was leaving the
party.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn disputes making such a threat and says Lopez and others are
trying to discredit him because they want a Latino to fill his seat.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez said the incident is
being investigated and will be referred next week to the district
attorney's office for review.</TE>
<TE>   "That's based on the fact that we had a criminal threat and that
she has asked for a restraining order," said Lopez, who is not
related to Irma Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn issued a statement Thursday acknowledging, "I have on some
occasions lost my temper." But he held his ground on his grievance
with Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sorry that I may have offended some, but [Lopez's] comments
appearing in the newspapers simply are untrue."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn's mercurial temper is legendary. Employees at the County
Government Center, his colleagues on the Board of Supervisors and
reporters have all been the target of a Flynn tongue-lashing over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   But he usually gets over it quickly and makes a joke to smooth
over ruffled feelings. He often jokes he is the only politician in
Ventura County who has had to apologize to every other politician.</TE>
<TE>   Although Flynn said he intended to step down after his current
term, he said he is rethinking that position because people keep
urging him to run again.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it depends on how my health is," Flynn said, "whether or
not I think it is time for me to leave this job. It may well be. But
I don't want to leave under this situation, where people are trying
to embarrass me and force me out."</TE>
<TE>   Latino leaders have tried to win Flynn's cooperation in stepping
down, in part because they know it will be difficult to dislodge him.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez, his opponent two years ago, received 35% of the vote to
Flynn's 53%.</TE>
<TE>   "I never underestimate John Flynn's ability to overcome
adversity," Lacayo said.</TE>
<TE>   "I call him the Kenny Hahn of Ventura County. Because Kenny Hahn
[the late Los Angeles County supervisor] had the same problems
representing a black district. But when it came down to the polls, it
was impossible to beat him," he said.</TE>

<HD>Group Fighting to Save Hospital</HD>
<DH>Health care: State orders owner of Daniel Freeman in Marina
del Rey to prove it is fulfilling agreements to serve the community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a last-ditch effort to save the nonprofit Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital, a coalition of community and labor groups asked the state
attorney general to stop the hospital's closure while his office
investigates whether Tenet Healthcare Corp., which owns the facility,
has violated its commitments.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer gave Tenet until today to provide
documents that prove the company has complied with the conditions it
agreed to when it purchased the Marina del Rey hospital in December,
a spokesman for the attorney general said.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition says the hospital is an essential neighborhood
resource and that Tenet has not lived up to its commitments.</LD>
<TE>   It says Tenet agreed in December that by now the company would
have established a local governing board to oversee continued care of
patients.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement also included maintaining a nearby urgent-care
facility, providing free transportation to surrounding medical
centers and establishing an outreach program to let residents know
about their options after the hospital closes.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have a heart attack, where will I go?" asked the president
of the Vista Del Mar Network, Julie Inouye, whose husband is a
physician at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Doctors are being displaced. Patients are being displaced. This
is about our region right now.... It's about life and death."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say Tenet will have those services in place
before the hospital closes in August.</TE>
<TE>   "We are under no obligation to have these services prior to the
closure," said Harris Koenig, chief executive officer of Daniel
Freeman Marina Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has consulted community physicians and health-care
organizations in the area to find out the community's needs, and
urgent care and transportation to nearby hospitals will be provided
closer to the time of the hospital's closure, Koenig said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet has also signed a letter of intent with the county to
upgrade the Tenet-owned Centinela Hospital near Los Angeles
International Airport to a high-end urgent-care center with basic
life support services, said Tenet spokesman David Langness.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's psychiatric and chemical dependency unit has
closed. Medical staff refer those patients to Tenet's Brotman Medical
Center in Culver City. The Marina hospital emergency room is to close
at the end of next month, Koenig said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also owns Daniel Freeman Memorial in Inglewood, which will
remain open. The Marina hospital's closure will be the second
hospital shut by Tenet in Los Angeles County this year.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital planned to launch a public awareness campaign this
week notifying residents of nearby medical facilities and how to get
to those places, Koenig said. Some residents think that's not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Demographically, we are a graying neighborhood," said Terry
Conner, president of the Villa Marina Council. "The other Tenet
properties are 13 to 19 minutes away.... Time is of significance."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Commission will
hold a public hearing July 17 on the closure of the hospital, which
community members said serves many low-income residents of Venice and
the Marina.</TE>

<HD>John Entwistle, 57; Innovative Bass Player Co-Founded the
Who</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Entwistle, a founding member of the Who hailed by musicians as
an innovative bassist but often overshadowed onstage by his fiery
bandmates, died Thursday in Las Vegas on the eve of the band's
reunion tour. He was 57.</LD>
<LD>   A statement from the Clark County coroner's office described the
preliminary cause of death as a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   The tour, which had been scheduled to begin tonight at the Hard
Rock Hotel and Casino and included a stop Saturday in Irvine and
Monday at the Hollywood Bowl, has been canceled, promoter Andy Hewitt
said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment about Entwistle's death from the
members of the band, who were said to be in shock.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is devastated; you have to remember that [Roger]
Daltrey and [Pete] Townshend have known this guy forever," Hewitt
said.</TE>
<TE>   Entwistle's passing, coupled with the 1978 overdose death of
drummer Keith Moon, leaves the Who's original membership reduced by
half: Guitarist Townshend and frontman Daltrey are the lone surviving
members of the British Invasion powerhouse that for a time rivaled
the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones as the most vital rock
voice of youth.</TE>
<TE>   The spotlight on the band often did not extend to Entwistle, who
was easy for casual fans to miss when put beside the whirling guitar
wizardry of Townshend, the war-cry vocals of bronzed singer Daltrey
and the bombast of drummer Moon. Daltrey would twirl his microphone
like a reckless lariat above his head, Townshend would slash at his
guitar with a windmill arm movement, and they would sometimes destroy
their instruments at the end of the show in anarchic delight--all
while the bearded, sly Entwistle stood like a ramrod-straight
commuter awaiting a morning train.</TE>
<TE>   Songs such as "My Generation," "I Can't Explain," "Pinball
Wizard," "Won't Get Fooled Again" and "Long Live Rock," along with
ambitious concept pieces such as "Tommy," made Townshend and Daltrey
into icons, and Moon was popular as a cheerful decadent. But
Entwistle was nicknamed "the Ox," which spoke to his steady habit of
lugging the band's load. "John doesn't demand attention," Townshend
was known to say, "For years, nobody even noticed John was there."</TE>
<TE>   Still, at the height of the band's powers, Entwistle was hailed in
music circles as the best bass player in rock, and in niche music
communities he was seen as capitalizing on the unconventional styles
of Townshend and Moon to broaden the role of bass player. Total
Guitar magazine, for example, named him "bassist of the millennium."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Manzarek, the Doors' keyboard player, said Thursday that
Entwistle was "one of the great, great rock 'n' roll bassists of all
time. A real genius."</TE>
<TE>   His contributions to the Who songbook were lesser known songs,
including "Boris the Spider," "My Wife," "Doctor Doctor" and
"Someone's Coming," but he was hailed as a bedrock contributor whose
signature work on "Won't Get Fooled Again," "Bargain" and dozens of
other songs influenced generations of bass players to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an inspiration to all of us," said Mike Watt, the bass
player in seminal Los Angeles alt-rock bands Minutemen and Firehose.
"You felt [as a bass player] like you were kind of picked last when
they were picking teams. That guy was a monster. His sound was such a
signature. He was someone who showed you did not have to kowtow, you
could be an important part of the band."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a somewhat aristocratic mien, Entwistle and his bandmates
grew up in London's working-class Shepard's Bush district. John Alec
Entwistle, born Oct. 4, 1944, was the son of Herbert and Maude
Entwistle of Chiswick, a trumpet player and piano player,
respectively. When their marriage failed, the young John went to live
with his grandparents. His grandfather had a penchant for letting the
youngster sing in local clubhouses.</TE>
<TE>   The boy trained on a variety of instruments (including the French
horn, which he would later use distinctively on several Who songs,
notably "Overture" from "Tommy") and showed an interest in jazz until
rock guitarist Duane Eddy caught his ear. He played in a number of
local bands and crossed paths with Daltrey when they played together
in a group called the Detours. Entwistle recommended another local
for membership: Townshend, the gangly lad who would become the most
powerful creative compass for the band that eventually added Moon and
took the name the Who.</TE>
<TE>   The Who were known as brawny, volatile performers in the Mod
scene, and they moved from club sensation to a force on the charts
with their first major single, "I Can't Explain," a Top 10 hit in
England. A string of hits followed that built their credentials at
home and in the United States, and performances at the Monterey Pop
Festival in 1967 and Woodstock in 1969, along with the release of
"Tommy" in 1969, cemented their U.S. stardom.</TE>
<TE>   A year after "Tommy," Entwistle released his first solo album,
"Smash Your Head Against the Wall." Three more of his own albums
would follow in the next four years. He would later tour with the
John Entwistle Band. Like George Harrison, the late Beatle who chafed
as his bandmates got the majority of attention and artistic freedom,
Entwistle longed for his due both in the band and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not quiet, everyone else is too loud," he sang in "The Quiet
One" on the Who's "Face Dances" album. In 1981, he told The Times
that he was subtle, not shy: "I just tiptoe away instead of getting
arrested. A lot of times when Keith was blowing up toilets I was
standing behind him with the matches."</TE>
<TE>   The internal forces pulling the band in different directions led
to the band's breakup by the 1980s, but they set aside their
squabbles to mount several "farewell" and reunion tours. The latest
one was supposed to lead back to a long abandoned path: the studio.
Daltrey had said in recent months that the band would reunite to
record new material for the first time since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Entwistle arrived in the desert city a day earlier
than his bandmates for an exhibit at the Aladdin Hotel and Casino of
his artwork, one of his passions. One of his drawings, a playful
sketch of the band members' feet and hands framing a jumble of
"connect-the-dots," was used for the band's aptly titled "The Who by
Numbers" album. Entwistle's body was found in his room at the Hard
Rock Hotel and Casino, the resort that also houses the Joint, the
venue that had been tabbed as the opening night spot on the band's
three-month U.S. tour.</TE>
<TE>   A Who film festival already scheduled for Sunday afternoon at
Grauman's Egyptian Theatre has been converted to a memorial for the
bassist.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 15, Testifies of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Courts: Yorba Linda teen takes stand in felony case against
parents. Defense attorney calls him a liar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Yorba Linda teenager on Thursday recounted four years of what he
says was physical and mental abuse at the hands of his father and
stepmother.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors have charged Grady Machnick, a sergeant with the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and Deborah Machnick, a former
elementary school principal, with felony child abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The Machnicks have strongly denied any wrongdoing. Their attorney,
John Barnett, has said he will prove that the Machnicks were simply
disciplining their 15-year-old son and did not commit any criminal
acts. He also described the boy as a compulsive liar who needed
strong discipline because he threatened his stepmother and often
misbehaved.</LD>
<TE>   The boy testified at a preliminary hearing in which a judge will
decide whether there is enough evidence for a trial.</TE>
<TE>   The teen said his stepmother made him pose for nude photographs
and smeared dog feces on his backpack.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, he said, he sneaked out of the house one night and
mistakenly left the back door open. As punishment, he said, his
stepmother told him to take off all his clothes and photographed him.
She allegedly threatened to post the photos at his school and made
fun of his anatomy.</TE>
<TE>   The teen said his father threw him against the wall and spanked
him for lying.</TE>
<TE>   However, Barnett said that the boy, who is now living with foster
parents, was not fully forthcoming about his own actions. In
cross-examination, the boy acknowledged that he stole food from a
grocery store, didn't always do his homework and lied to his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a compulsive liar and a compulsive thief," Barnett said.</TE>

<HD>Man Kills Girlfriend, Himself at Apartment</HD>
<DH>Canoga Park: Police are treating the shootings as a
murder-suicide. The woman's neighbors report hearing a loud argument
the day before.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man fatally shot his girlfriend before taking his own life at the
woman's Canoga Park apartment on Thursday in what police said was an
apparent murder-suicide.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, who had four children, was found shot to death in the
bedroom of a ground-floor unit in the International Regency apartment
complex in the 8600 block of International Avenue, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Two of her children, an infant and a toddler, as well as the
victim's sister were in the home at the time of the shootings,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The children will be taken into protective custody by the county
Department of Children and Family Services.</TE>
<TE>   The woman's two older children, whose ages were not released, were
not at home at the time of the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department Robbery-Homicide Division Lt. Carlos
Velez said a maintenance worker at the complex had knocked on the
woman's apartment door about 9:30 a.m. and was told to enter.</TE>
<TE>   "The next thing he knows, he hears a gunshot and a man exits the
bedroom, enters the living room and shoots himself," Velez said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not release the names of the woman or the man, who
was believed to be her boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   The woman was described by neighbors as a friendly person who sold
Avon products to other apartment residents.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, neighbors said they heard a loud argument in the
apartment, but didn't report the incident because it quickly quieted
down.</TE>
<TE>   "[People] always hear firecrackers, gunshots and backfiring cars,"
said Sherry Lewis, a resident of the complex. "All the neighbors
didn't think anything of it until the police came."</TE>

<HD>Police Lab Plans OKd Despite D.A.'s Criticism</HD>
<DH>Forensics: Cooley says proposed staffing for DNA and
firearms analysis is inadequate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the objections of Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley,
the region's top police officials approved architectural plans for a
new $96-million crime lab Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Cooley urged that staffing planned for firearms and DNA analysis
be increased and that the building plans be revised to accommodate
the larger staffs.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and interim Los Angeles Police
Chief Martin Pomeroy said they will work to address Cooley's
concerns. Each said the plan is flexible, and pledged to add more
staff and space if they receive more funds.</LD>
<TE>   "The architectural program is not an architectural finality," said
Baca, who is embroiled in a heated battle with county supervisors
over budget cuts. "The building is designed to accommodate change."</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said that what he described as inadequate plans could hurt
prosecution of criminal cases and result in an even larger backlog of
unsolved cases.</TE>
<TE>   "The most urgent needs now and in the foreseeable future are in
the areas of DNA analysis and firearms work," Cooley said. "If these
priorities are not addressed, the new crime lab will be obsolete the
day it opens."</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy said he recognizes that DNA is a critical technological
tool and that DNA criminalists could work in shifts at the new lab to
maximize space. Baca and Pomeroy pledged to review unsolved sexual
assault and rape cases in an attempt to reduce investigation
backlogs.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said he believes that his points will be taken into
consideration before the lab is built on the Cal State Los Angeles
campus.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has planned for 34 employees for its DNA section; Cooley
projects that the department will need at least 72. The Sheriff's
Department has planned for 15 firearms examiners and two technicians
and needs at least 26, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Construction is to begin in September 2003, and the five-floor
building is scheduled to open in April 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Several rape victims and advocates urged the officials to make the
changes Cooley recommended. Rape survivor Jeri Elster told them that
their decision would have an impact for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD proposal for the new crime lab presently under
consideration is deficient and will be antiquated upon opening its
doors," Elster said.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, rape survivor Karen Pomer said she was
disappointed. "I was hoping they would be more responsive," said
Pomer, whose case was solved four years after she was attacked. "It
doesn't make sense to me."</TE>

<HD>Encino Traffic Measures Fail to Pass</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Encino Hills residents failed to approve a package of measures
proposed by the city Department of Transportation aimed at reducing
traffic in their neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting with the Encino Community Council to announce the
results of the mail-in ballot, city transportation representatives
said only 35% of the area's 4,130 residents submitted ballots. To
pass, at least 40% of the ballots needed to be returned, with
two-thirds of the voters approving the proposed traffic measures.</LD>
<LD>   Ballots were sent to people who live south of Ventura Boulevard in
an Encino neighborhood often used by commuters as a shortcut through
the Santa Monica Mountains. The proposals included making traffic
lights remain red longer, installing no-turn signs and adding a
left-turn signal at the San Diego Freeway onramp at Sherman Oaks
Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   Clive Grawe, an LADOT engineer, studied the traffic patterns in
the area for two years. He said because the department has to
concentrate on other projects, the Encino issue "won't be considered
in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the measures vowed to continue their efforts to get
the city's help in curbing traffic, which they said threatens their
safety and quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   "The problems are too great for the [Department of Transportation]
to drop and not proceed with some remedial action for the area," said
Margery Grossman, a Ballina Canyon Road resident who heads the
traffic committee of the Encino Community Council.</TE>

<HD>DWP Deal Called 'Ricochet'</HD>
<DH>Energy: Tapes detail trading ploy defended by utility.
State saw it as a 'trick' to drive up costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power orchestrated a deal in
the fall of 2000 that briefly drove up the price of power before
being canceled by state grid operators who said they were on to
"L.A.'s tricks," according to transcripts of power trader phone
conversations released Thursday by state Senate investigators.</LD>
<LD>   The legislative hearing ended with a state senator warning DWP
officials that their action "really looks downright rotten." But DWP
managers denied that they engaged in "ricochet" power trades in which
power is exported out of California, then brought back in and sold to
California grid operators at a higher price.</LD>
<LD>   But transcripts of 11 taped conversations on Nov. 12, 2000, among
employees of DWP, the state's grid-operating agency and two private
energy companies show that others described the deal as a "ricochet"
banned by the California Independent System Operator, which runs most
of the state's transmission system.</LD>
<TE>   "I just don't see what's wrong with L.A. sending it north," said
Steve Tish, a power trader with PG&amp;E National Energy Group, to a
fellow trader in one of the transcribed conversations. At the time,
Cal-ISO was rebuffing the attempt of PG&amp;E National Energy Group and
DWP to continue sending power from Southern California to the Oregon
border and back.</TE>
<TE>   NEG trader David Pierce responded, "Well, 'cause it's a ricochet.
You can't take power out of California and send it right back in.
That's the definition of a ricochet."</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials disputed that the power trade at issue fit the
definition of an improper "ricochet," also known as megawatt
laundering, because the electricity did not leave the state but
rather was redirected from a point where Cal-ISO's transmission grid
met that of the Bonneville Power Authority in Oregon. In documents
released last month, Enron Corp. described such a scheme, as well as
others called "Death Star" and "Fat Boy."</TE>
<TE>   But staff of the Senate select committee to investigate price
manipulation of California's wholesale electricity market concluded
that the effect of what DWP officials called a "bounce-back" was the
same as an Enron-style ricochet: Consumers paid more for power.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Senate committee analysis of the transcripts
released Thursday, the DWP deal started with 50 megawatts purchased
at the Arizona border for $50 or $70 per megawatt-hour and ended with
50 megawatts sold to state grid operators at an estimated $250 per
megawatt-hour.</TE>
<TE>   "There was money made by a number of market participants," said
Larry Drivon, special counsel to the committee. "The net effect was
people paid more for this electricity than was needed to be paid."</TE>
<TE>   Drivon also said that the Nov. 12, 2000, transaction may have
involved speculative trading by DWP, which is illegal for a utility
owned by a municipality.</TE>
<TE>   DWP power trading manager Mark Ward, who testified before the
panel, argued that the transaction was not speculative trading
because it did not involve DWP taking a position in the market in the
hope that prices would move in its favor.</TE>
<TE>   "During the state's energy crisis in 2000 and 2001," said Ward in
a prepared opening statement to the committee, "the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power went to extraordinary measures to help
keep the lights on for the people of California. In doing so, LADWP
played by the rules."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate committee, chaired by Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana),
began investigating the Nov. 12, 2000, deal earlier this month after
receiving a copy of an e-mail about it in documents requested from
PG&amp;E National Energy Group.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail from one PG&amp;E trader to others warned them to "beware
of ricochets with LDWP."</TE>
<TE>   Senate committee investigator Chris Schreiber testified Thursday
that the author of the e-mail, David Pierce, told him that when he
wrote the e-mail he had in mind the same sort of electricity deal as
described by Enron in its December 2000 memo.</TE>
<TE>   "He made very clear that he intended the Enron definition," said
Schreiber.</TE>
<TE>   The distinction matters to the Senate committee because DWP
officials swore in a May statement that in 2000 their traders did not
engage in any transactions of the sort described in the Enron memo.
DWP officials made a similar statement under oath to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by Dunn, Ward told the committee that he
interviewed several traders and their supervisors before making the
declarations to the Senate and FERC. But he did not interview all the
traders who were working for DWP during 2000, Ward said, including a
trader involved in the Nov. 12 incident.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Won't Require Grease Disposal Units</HD>
<DH>City Council: Ordinance calls for inspections at
restaurants, training to prevent clogged sewers. That's not enough,
environmentalists say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move criticized by environmentalists but welcomed by restaurant
owners, Laguna Beach officials have backpedaled on an ambitious plan
that would have required eateries to install underground grease
disposals.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council unanimously passed a grease-control ordinance
Tuesday night that drops an earlier plan to require so-called
interceptors at all restaurants, opting instead to develop
comprehensive training, inspection and enforcement policies.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Wayne Baglin said the ordinance strikes a fair balance that
officials hope will reduce grease blockages--that are blamed for
sewer overflows--without creating hardships for restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think I'd call it watered down," Baglin said of the
measure, which would take effect after a second reading. "I think I'd
call it pragmatic.</TE>
<TE>   "We started with an extreme approach. What we found is that there
were maybe 85 food establishments that would need the devices....
It's not economically or physically feasible to require all of the
restaurants to have them."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Wilson, local chairman of the Surfrider Foundation,
disagreed: "We're disappointed in the ordinance. We think it's very
weak and will prove to be ineffective."</TE>
<TE>   The push for grease interceptors has been driven by evidence that
urban runoff and blocked sewers are polluting California beaches,
rivers and creeks. Officials and environmentalists agree that too
much hot fat from skillets and fryers is sliding into sewer lines,
then hardening and causing blockages that lead to spills.</TE>
<TE>   But soon after the proposal for grease interceptors was made,
restaurateurs argued there was not enough room in some seaside

that could reach $50,000, many mom-and-pop operations said they could
not afford the expense.</TE>

<HD>Landers Quake Gave Experts New Insights</HD>
<DH>Geology: The event 10 years ago showed that big jolts can
span multiple faults and can trigger temblors hundreds of miles away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago today, the Landers earthquake set scientists on some
new courses, proving that the seismic process was more complicated
than they had thought and showing that a big enough jolt could span
more than one quake fault at once.</LD>
<LD>   The magnitude-7.3 Landers temblor and the 6.5 aftershock just
hours later near Big Bear remain the most powerful quake sequence in
Southern California since the magnitude-7.7 Tehachapi quake of July
21, 1952. As such, the 1992 combination was the third most powerful
seismic event in the state in the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   The Landers quake occurred in the Mojave Desert, centered in
sparsely populated territory 100 miles east of Los Angeles, causing
only one death and fairly minimal damage.</LD>
<TE>   But scientists consider the event to be of first-rank significance
for what it taught them about the earthquake process. A few
aftershocks of this major quake still occur, and research into what
happened and what may follow in the future continues to be intensive.</TE>
<TE>   The most important finding from Landers, according to Tom Henyey,
deputy director of the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC,
is proof not only that a big earthquake can span more than one
fault--Landers directly occurred on three--but that it can trigger
quakes hundreds of miles away.</TE>
<TE>   So-called "sympathetic" quakes quickly followed the Landers event
as far away as the volcanic areas in Yellowstone National Park and
Mammoth Lakes, in addition to near Mojave, Calif., and in southern
Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "So we began to think there could be correlations of quake
activity over large distances and several faults," Henyey said. "And
when the [7.1] Hector Mine quake occurred in the fall of 1999, we
learned more about stress transfers and how one big quake could bring
about stress changes that would trigger another nearby in a
relatively short amount of time."</TE>
<TE>   Another example of one quake perhaps leading to more was seen in
the 1994 Northridge quake, which followed by 23 years the 1971
Sylmar-San Fernando, both about magnitude 6.7. Their epicenters were
only a few miles apart.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Hector Mine, following the nearby Landers temblor by only
seven years, and the Northridge events weakened the argument that a
big quake necessarily foreshadows an extended period of little
seismic activity nearby. The 23 years between the two San Fernando
Valley earthquakes might seem a long time to some, but in geologic
terms, it is a very short period.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy Jones, the scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological
Survey's Pasadena office, said that after the Landers event,
scientists went back and were able to show that the great San
Francisco quake of 1906 also triggered many quakes long distances
from the epicenter.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said a graduate student at San Diego State, Aaron Metzner,
has researched the 1906 newspapers and found reports of quakes in
many California locales after the San Francisco disaster. Two of the
largest were a magnitude-6 quake in the Imperial Valley and a
magnitude-5 in Santa Monica Bay.</TE>
<TE>   But it was not until after the Landers quake that scientists were
able to confirm the direct correlation in time and stress transfers.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Jones said, the Hector Mine quake occurring parallel to the
Landers one and fairly close, to the northeast, helped to further
research about stress transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Heaton, an earthquake engineering professor at Caltech, said
the fact that the Landers temblor spanned three separate faults and
that ruptures occurred along all three "really started us thinking
about fundamental issues of how earthquakes rupture in the first
place."</TE>
<TE>   There were certain discontinuities, or gaps, between areas that
were shaken in the Landers quake and its aftershocks that showed
scientists how the process is more complicated than they had thought.
And the fact that the quake was well recorded provided data
supporting that concept, Heaton said.</TE>
<TE>   The Landers event also gave support to the work of geophysicist
Amos Nur at Stanford, who in 1989 wrote a paper with an Israeli and
an Italian scientist contending that a new fault system was emerging
in what he called the Eastern California Shear Zone. That extended in
a line from the epicenter of the magnitude-8 Owens Valley quake of
1872 south through Barstow, Landers and Yucca Valley to the Palm
Springs area.</TE>
<TE>   Both the magnitude-6.1 Joshua Tree quake that preceded the one in
Landers by two months, and the Landers quake, tended to confirm Nur's
reasoning. He had already pointed out in 1989 that there had been
four or five sizable quakes in the 20th century along this general
line.</TE>
<TE>   Other research into the Owens Valley-Landers orientation of quakes
has been done recently by Gilles Peltzer, a UCLA scientist who
specializes in the new satellite radar analysis known as
"interferometry," which can show minute geologic slippage along
faults.</TE>
<TE>   Peltzer and several colleagues have found that in a gap with few
if any large earthquakes between the southern end of the Owens Valley
rupture and the northern end of the Landers rupture, there still
seems in recent years to have been a slippage rate two or three times
higher than the normal of past centuries. That means stress has been
accumulating.</TE>
<TE>   This may indicate that a magnitude-7 quake could occur in the gap,
roughly between Barstow and Coso Junction along U.S. 395, a span of
about 100 miles, in the years ahead, although no precise time frame
is evident, Peltzer said this week.</TE>

<HD>County Rebuffed in Suit Over Man's Death</HD>

<LD>Ruling that the county of Los Angeles can be held liable for an
inmate's beating death, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on
Thursday dealt a setback to the county's repeated efforts to deflect
responsibility to the state in such cases.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came in a federal civil rights lawsuit brought by the
family of Mauricio Avalos, who died in 1999 after being attacked by
cellmates at Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The county had argued it was not liable because the sheriff, who
runs the jails, is an agent of the state of California, not the
county. The state is immune from federal civil rights lawsuits.</LD>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit disagreed with the county, finding that the
sheriff is an agent of the county in his administration of the jails
under the state Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling cited state law giving counties "ultimate power" over
jails and requiring counties to indemnify sheriffs against monetary
judgments.</TE>
<TE>   In handing down the decision, the 9th Circuit noted that it has
found in the past that the sheriff acts on behalf of the county, both
in administering the jails and in some law enforcement functions,
such as keeping the peace inside jails.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Los Angeles County said they have not yet decided
whether to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Karpel, who is representing Avalos' family, applauded the
ruling. "I think the potential damages in this case could be
significant," Karpel said. "They had prior notice of the danger to
this prisoner and they refused to do anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   Avalos was attacked in a six-person cell in a gang unit of the
jail even after he told jail officials that he feared for his life
and requested a transfer, according to Karpel.</TE>

<LD>Maybe it was the arrival of summer, but a malaise seemed to have
settled over the republic, and I feared we had lost our sense of
national purpose. That, however, was before the Pledge of Allegiance
ruling in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Nutball California has rallied the country against the godless
forces of evil. On talk shows and on street corners, the
blood-boiling topic of the day is the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling--affecting nine Western states--that the pledge is
unconstitutional because the words "under God" are an endorsement of
religion.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, where the issue was of course seen as a test of
patriotism and faith, elected officials elbowed past each other in a
race to the nearest TV camera.</LD>
<TE>   "Ridiculous," said President Bush, a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   "Just nuts," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat.
The Senate voted unanimously to condemn the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   They happen to be right. The 9th Circuit, ruling on a case brought
by an Elk Grove atheist, took separation of church and state to a
silly and unnecessary extreme.</TE>
<TE>   But at the risk of being branded a traitor, I'd like to say that
Americans are never more shallow or hypocritical than when they break
out in hives over issues like the burning of the flag or the wording
of the Pledge of Allegiance.</TE>
<TE>   For my money, there are a dozen better reasons to scream and yell
and march in the streets. I could begin with schools that constitute
one of the greatest failures in the industrialized world, or perhaps
a health-care system that leaves out roughly 40 million people and
exasperates everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   But the more logical target of collective rage is the current
state of affairs in corporate America. As an institution, big
business never reached for the sky when it came to virtue and
goodwill, but it is setting the bar a little lower every day.</TE>
<TE>   We've got lies, cover-ups and chief executives stealing away with
obscene stacks of cash while employees and shareholders get stiffed.
Any idea how they got away with it for so long?</TE>
<TE>   Simple. They bought everyone off.</TE>
<TE>   That includes both sides of the aisle in Congress, as well as
presidents past and present. They also managed without much
interference to get their own people appointed to the regulatory
agencies. WorldCom, the latest star to fall from the sky, kicked $4
million into political campaigns in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Although the words "under God" can create a human wave that
undulates from sea to shining sea, the words "campaign finance
reform" can't seem to pry anyone off the couch.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis climbed atop a soapbox to tell us
the Pledge of Allegiance was "one of our most profound human
expressions of American patriotism." A day earlier, he'd gotten his
name in the paper for blocking a $22-million tax on the timber
industry after pocketing $105,000 in donations to his reelection
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Across the fruited plain, members of the House of Representatives
gathered on the steps of the Capitol to recite the Pledge of
Allegiance. As I recall, it contains the words "with liberty and
justice for all," a claim disputed by people locked up without
charges after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional representatives are not easily shamed by
hypocrisy or obvious self-interest. These are the folks who, after
Sept. 11, snuffed a plea for gas mileage standards that would have
reduced our dependence on foreign oil. Some of them, bought and paid
for by auto makers, even said they simply could not interfere with
Americans' constitutional right to drive vehicles the size of
dinosaurs.</TE>
<TE>   Crown thy good with brotherhood. And watch out Saddam, because by
all accounts, we may soon attempt to bomb the snot out of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the clamor over the pledge, this developing story has
scarcely gotten a rise out of the American public. I can actually see
us starting World War III in the fall without anyone noticing. We'll
be too busy debating the appropriateness of singing "God Bless
America" at high school football games.</TE>
<TE>   I am no defender of Saddam. I was in Iraq and watched as Kurdish
refugees, who had been gassed, machine-gunned, and carpet-bombed by
Saddam, dug holes in the mud each morning to bury their children and
elders.</TE>
<TE>   But I haven't been persuaded that a war on Iraq would accomplish
anything other than to make certain that millions more Muslims will
sign up to maim, kill and terrorize Westerners into the next
millennium.</TE>
<TE>   And besides, if we're dying to drop bombs, wasn't it Saudi Arabia
that harbored most of the 9/11 terrorists? Does the constitutional
right to drive a Ford Expedition demand that we feign ignorance as
long as the oil is flowing our way?</TE>
<TE>   I think I know the reason we're not marching in the streets. We're
in on the deal. We've been bought off, too, and we were an easy mark,
like kids giving in to the street corner creep who offers free candy.
We used to be satisfied sticking a few bucks into the Christmas club
each month, and then all of a sudden we wanted portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped asking questions and lost sight of any cause beyond our
own self-interest. The pledge is perfect for the time. It speaks to
our best sense of ourselves without requiring any sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   So fight the good fight, defenders of freedom. And fear not. If
there is a God--and frankly, the evidence is
circumstantial--something tells me He'll survive both the 9th Circuit
ruling and the appeal.</TE>

<HD>A Goodbye Wave for Brothers</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Surfers pay respects to two young men whose
bodies were found in an abandoned mine in Cleveland National Forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 40 surfers gathered in Newport Beach on Thursday, paddled 100
yards into the ocean, formed a circle and remembered their friends
Nicholas and Glenn Anderson, the brothers who died this week in an
abandoned mine.</LD>
<LD>   Their mother, Terry Kling, and stepfather, Marty Kling, hugged the
surfers as they headed out.</LD>
<LD>   "Not too somber," the stepfather said. "You know how the boys
would want it."</LD>
<TE>   Focusing on a surfboard that carried two leis and a wreath with
pictures of the young men, the surfers told stories and reminisced.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas, 23, was "a great friend. He made you the best person you
could be," said Kelly Silva, 24, of Yucca Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Silva and Joshua Stone, 23, couldn't stop laughing as they
remembered a 1997 road trip to Humboldt County in Nick's 1952 Ford
Falcon station wagon.</TE>
<TE>   Under ordinary circumstances, the trip might have taken half a
day.</TE>
<TE>   But they got caught in an El Nino storm and it took two days.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't even know how to get there; we couldn't see a thing,"
Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   The memorial was at a spot near lifeguard Tower 56, known for the
quality of the waves.</TE>
<TE>   It's where the brothers learned to surf.</TE>
<TE>   As the sun was setting, a group of dolphins swam past the surfers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a perfect moment," said Joey Borgese, 18, who was on the
water polo team and graduated a week ago from El Modena High School
with Glenn, 18.</TE>
<TE>   "We thanked them for being our friends and told them we wouldn't
be the same people if we hadn't met them."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers disappeared Sunday while exploring the murky waters
of an abandoned mine in the Cleveland National Forest. They were
found dead Monday by a team of sheriff's divers.</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Rush-era complex, known as the Blue Light Mine, has been
a magnet for hikers and teenagers, even though officials have
declared it a safety hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the air in the shaft where the brothers were
found contained just 4% oxygen and a collection of as-yet-unknown
gases.</TE>
<TE>   Publicity Hike Planned</TE>
<TE>   Friends and family plan to hike to the mine shaft Saturday morning
to draw attention to the dangerous spot they believe should be closed
off so no other lives are lost.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers and their friend, Matt Murphy, 17, hiked up rugged
Pine Canyon on Sunday afternoon to explore the abandoned 19th century
mines in the mountains above the former boomtown of Silverado.</TE>
<TE>   After entering the Blue Light's labyrinth of tunnels, they
encountered water in the tight chamber.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers kept going but Murphy refused to follow.</TE>
<TE>   He waited about two hours but never heard from the brothers, who
were described as strong swimmers and experienced cavers.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy phoned authorities, who began searching the area about 7
p.m. and stayed through the night as friends and family kept a vigil.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until Monday morning that a cave-diving specialist from
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department could be flown in.</TE>
<TE>   He and six other Los Angeles and Orange County sheriffs' divers
entered the inky underground pool and, using lights, found the
Andersons in 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The formal funeral service will be at 10:30 a.m. today at Calvary
Church in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday, Glenn's friends and water polo teammates--Borgese,
Eric Rath, Matt Maciha, Blake Lemke, Aaron Vaughan--and Glenn's best
friend, Robert Adams, wanted to say farewell as surfers.</TE>
<TE>   "They had this overwhelming need to do something on their level,"
said Rae Lynn Price, whose son was one of the brothers' friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Something Glenn and Nick would have done."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Helps Bernson Take the Wheel at MTA</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson was named chairman of
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Thursday after the
position was passed on by Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   Bernson assumed the role after being nominated at the MTA's
monthly board meeting by Hahn, who was in line to take the board
leadership. The chairmanship rotates through the 13-member panel
annually.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said he could not afford to take over the board because he
wants to devote his time and attention to fighting the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood secession votes on city ballots in November.</LD>
<TE>   The appointment of Bernson, who will lose his seat next year
because of term limits, is seen by some as a bonus for the Valley.
Residents there have long complained about traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure the Valley does get its fair share of MTA
attention, but that plays out over the entire region," said Bernson,
who was approved 9 to 0. "The whole county has serious needs."</TE>
<TE>   Among those needs, said Bernson, is figuring out how to build the
county's rail network and improve the agency's image.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson, a 23-year council member, will be serving concurrently as
chairman of the MTA, the Metrolink train service and the Southern
California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   "He has an obvious fix" on transportation issues, said MTA board
member and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. "It's a nice way for
him to finish up his career."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky is due to take the chairmanship next year.</TE>

<LD>A judge will decide July 8 whether Orange County voters will have two
candidates to choose from to replace Superior Court Judge Ronald
Kline, who last week won permission to take his name off the November
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Kline, who is facing child pornography and molestation charges,
failed to win a majority vote in a March bid for reelection and was
scheduled for a November runoff with Dana Point attorney John Adams,
the top vote-getter among several write-in candidates.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, write-in runner-up Gay Sandoval, also an attorney,
told Superior Court Judge John Woolley that she would like her name
to appear on the November ballot along with Adams'.</LD>
<TE>   "There's an election code statute that says if there's a vacancy
... it should be filled by the next-highest vote-getter," she said.
"That seems to apply directly to me, but it's up to the judge to
decide."</TE>

<HD>In Orange, Some Rejected Official City Slogans Have a Charm
All Their Own</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than 800 suggestions by residents, the city of Orange
selected "A Slice of Old Towne Charm" as its official motto.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the losers were a lot more colorful, however, if not as
stately. Rejected slogans included "Nicer Than Stanton" and "Our
Navel Is Better Than Christina Aguilera's."</LD>
<LD>   Such a deal: Today's questionable offers (see accompanying)
involve:</LD>
<TE>   * A camera that doesn't come cheap (Roland Gregg, West Hills);</TE>
<TE>   * A carpet that's nearly two centuries old (Gordon and Patricia
Bennett of Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   A new type of security? George Rodriguez of Pico Rivera snapped a
shot of a store window that seemed to inform visitors that they were
under surveillance (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Even paradise can be dangerous: Proof is furnished by Kathryn
Blackmun of Highland Park, who noticed a fruit advisory in Hilo,
Hawaii (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Something blue, something weird: US Weekly magazine took note of
this romantic month with a cover piece on Hollywood weddings,
including the "wackiest, way-out-there" ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite was the union of New York club singer Susanne Bartsch
with gym owner David Barton. She wore a flesh-toned leather cat suit,
he nothing but a G-string. At his wedding, Bat-muncher Ozzie Osbourne
sang "Fangs for the Memories" to his bride. And, of course, there was
a nice shot of Dennis Rodman in bridal drag.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine didn't mention some of the unique methods that stars
have used to avoid publicity, however. When Madonna and Sean Penn got
hitched in Malibu in 1985, for instance, an obscene message was drawn
in 6-foot-high letters on the nearby beach to make overhead camera
coverage unusable.</TE>
<TE>   Looking four-ward: My search for a phrase to replace "threepeat"
when the Lakers win their fourth straight title next year brought
several suggestions. Jim Dickey of Pomona thinks the feat would be a
"double double." Rod Kavanagh of Sherman Oaks rejects "fourpeat" as
"clunky and derivative," but says one popular choice among
sign-waving fans was the bilingual "quat-row." Rudi Nelson of
Torrance opted for "four-score" or "four on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   And David Daniel of Encino says if the team once again "silences
the cowbell-clangers of Sacramento" and everyone else, the Lakers
"will truly be 'a team four the ages.' "</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Columnist Diane Bell of the San Diego Union-Tribune
reports that when Chargers linebacker Junior Seau was asked if he had
ever tried reading the lips of opposing players, he responded:
"Everybody should know that I can't read because, remember, I went to
USC." (He was kidding, UCLA fans!)</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Plans Yearlong Party to Mark the City's Centennial</HD>
<DH>Birthday: Weekend events, including unveiling of a restored
landmark, will kick off the activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Oxnard heads into its 100th year, city officials Saturday will
mark the milestone with a birthday bash filled with music, comedy,
history lessons and, of course, a very large cake.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning with this weekend's celebration at Plaza Park, Oxnard
will host a year of events commemorating its June 30, 1903,
incorporation. A special event will be held each month in honor of
the birthday. Activities will include sporting events, a black-tie
dinner in the spring and a parade next summer.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said Saturday's free centennial
event--from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at C and 5th streets--will allow the
community to come together and celebrate the city's rich history.</LD>
<TE>   Comedian George Lopez, star of a self-titled ABC sitcom, will give
a sample of his stand-up act beginning at noon. Also scheduled are
performances by several local music groups, along with children's
activities, a Wall of History display and a 5-foot-tall birthday cake
large enough to feed 1,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "One hundred years ago most of the rest of the cities in the
county weren't established, so people came to Oxnard for many of
their needs," said the city's community affairs manager, Jeanette
Villanueva-Walker, chairwoman of the event. The city "really has a
fascinating history and hopefully people will learn more about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Wall of History, 10 feet tall and 20 feet wide, features a
montage of photos that cover the city's history decade by decade. The
display includes vintage photos of a sugar beet factory built by
Oxnard brothers in the late 1800s; the town as it was being built,
including such early businesses as the Bank of A. Levy and Poggi's
Drug Store; and the commercial and yacht harbor built by the Oxnard
Harbor District after its formation in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   The community's history dates from the 1500s when it was inhabited
by Chumash Indians. Drawn to the warm climate and fertile soil, early
European settlers developed the coastal plain in the mid-1500s into a
major farming area with lima beans as a primary crop.</TE>
<TE>   That changed when Henry T. Oxnard introduced sugar beets to local
farmers in 1897 and two years later built a factory to process them.
A town of new workers soon sprang up. From there, churches, stores
and banks were built, and the Oxnard Union High School District was
formed in 1902. Today, Oxnard is Ventura County's largest city with
about 180,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Musical acts scheduled Saturday include local band Persuasion,
which will offer oldies and contemporary tunes, the Sal Cracchiolo
and Melanie Jackson Sextet playing Latin jazz, and a performance by
the Oxnard High School band. There also will be an 11:30 a.m. concert
by Darin Spencer, who performs songs for children.</TE>
<TE>   Other activities include a kids' corner with arts and crafts,
storytelling and historical skits performed by youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   The event will also mark the unveiling of the park's refurbished
pagoda, a historical landmark built in 1910. The Asian-themed
structure was designed by Alfred J. Preist, a Los Angeles-based
architect, and in 1971 declared the county's Historical Landmark No.
17. It was originally built as a decorative structure around a tank
used for storing water for the park's trees, shrubs, flowers and
grass. It was designed as a bandstand.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the pagoda is an icon of the community, like the Eiffel
Tower in Paris or the Empire State Building in New York," said
longtime Oxnard resident Gary Blum, manager of the city's historical
Heritage Square. Blum will emcee Saturday's event.</TE>
<TE>   For the past six months crews have restored the structure with a
new roof, electrical repairs, seismic upgrades and new paint. Most of
the work will be completed by Saturday, with only the custom roof
requiring a few more weeks of work, Blum said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dwight C. "Bill" Baum, 89, a financier and philanthropist whose
career in Los Angeles spanned more than five decades, died June 19 of
pneumonia at a convalescent home in Pasadena. He was a longtime
resident of San Marino.</LD>
<LD>   Baum was born in Syracuse, N.Y., the son of Dwight J. Baum, a
prominent New York architect whose projects included more than 100
homes along the Hudson River in the Bronx's Riverdale section.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Baum moved to Los Angeles in 1946 and began his career in
corporate finance with Eastman Dillon &amp; Co. He worked mostly with
that company for the next several decades of mergers and changes of
name, including to Blyth Eastman Dillon &amp; Co., and a subsequent
transaction that folded that company into PaineWebber.</LD>
<TE>   Baum was vice president and regional manager for PaineWebber in
L.A. until 1984, when he opened an office in Pasadena. A past
president of the Los Angeles Society of Security Analysts, he worked
until shortly before his death.</TE>
<TE>   His philanthropy benefited the National Federation of the Blind,
enabling that group to establish a program in Los Angeles that gives
the blind telephone access to the Los Angeles Times and other
newspapers. He also gave $2.5 million to USC in 2000 to help build a
new engineering and multimedia building. He had a degree in
electrical engineering from Cornell University, his alma mater, which
he also supported.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Dorfman, 85, a Harvard University professor respected for his
contributions to linear programming and environmental economics, died
Monday at his home in Belmont, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   An aspiring poet in his youth, he was known to colleagues for the
clarity and grace of his writing about complex topics such as linear
models of production and economic history.</LD>
<LD>   He was a co-author, with Nobel Laureate Robert M. Solow and
economist Paul A. Samuelson, of 1958's "Linear Programming and
Economic Analysis." He also wrote "Application of Linear Programming
to the Theory of the Firm." Linear programming is a mathematical
modeling technique useful for guiding quantitative decisions in
business and other fields.</LD>
<TE>   Born in New York City in 1916, Dorfman was educated at Columbia
and UC Berkeley. He joined Harvard in 1955 and remained until his
retirement 32 years later. He began his career as a statistician.</TE>

<LD>In Washington, they sang a rousing, bipartisan rendition of "God
Bless America." In Sacramento, they scrambled to pass resolutions
aimed at keeping the Pledge of Allegiance intact.</LD>
<LD>   One day after a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled the pledge unconstitutional because it includes the words
"under God," politicians from coast to coast rushed to condemn the
decision and indignantly demand it be overturned.</LD>
<LD>   Some decried the decision as an assault on traditional American
values. Others dubbed it political correctness run amok.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly everyone--from President Bush on down--had something to
say. After all, this is an election year, and the Pledge of
Allegiance--embodying love of country and impeccable citizenship--is
a powerful symbol for Democrats and Republicans alike.</TE>
<TE>   With Fourth of July approaching and Sept. 11 a still-vivid memory,
politicians "would be crazy not to wrap themselves in this issue,"
said Barbara O'Connor, director of the Institute for the Study of
Politics and Media at Cal State Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "The community psyche of the American public is still very
fragile," she said, "So any change in the pledge, or support for that
change, would be seen as unpatriotic."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever their motivation, lawmakers eagerly jumped into the fray
Thursday--with some using the issue to bludgeon political foes.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis vowed to make the strongest
possible case as California moves to overturn the court's ruling. The
state, along with the federal government, the Sacramento schools and
the Elk Grove School District, were defendants in the suit, brought
by a Sacramento County atheist.</TE>
<TE>   Standing before two American flags and beside a printed version of
the pledge, the governor said he was "shocked and personally
offended" by the "wrong-headed" ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, his gubernatorial opponent, GOP candidate Bill Simon
Jr., stood on the steps of the 9th Circuit Court and questioned the
governor's commitment to the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Simon charged that Davis had failed to file any legal arguments
defending the pledge because he was too busy raising campaign money:
"I am here today to say that as governor I will not waver in
defending the pledge ... and I will not hesitate in saluting our
flag," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer called Simon's charge
"absurd," noting that the state was not "served properly" and that
none of the attorneys who would handle such a matter knew of the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The day began as it usually does in Congress and the
Legislature--with recitations of the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a difference this time: The seats were full and the
politicians were paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   With cameras rolling and reporters scribbling notes, lawmakers in
Sacramento stood, erect and with hands over hearts, and raised the
volume considerably when they came to the words "under God."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Senate did the same and also approved, by a
99-0 vote, a bill reaffirming support for the pledge and "In God We
Trust" as the national motto. In the House, members from both parties
sang "God Bless America," then passed a resolution, 416 to 3,
protesting the court's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The three foes were all Democrats, including two from California:
Reps. Pete Stark of Fremont and Michael M. Honda of San Jose. Honda
said he voted against the resolution to uphold the principle of
separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I'm patriotic," he said. But, he added, "We're a
pluralistic society. To say 'under God' would only profess one type
of religion."</TE>
<TE>   Stark said the court was right. Adding the words "under God" to
the pledge, as Congress did in 1954, was wrong because the phrase
"does not accommodate the diversity of religious and personal beliefs
in our nation as the Constitution requires," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A similar resolution affirming the pledge came up late in the day
in the state Assembly--but only after hours of rhetorical swordplay
between lawmakers dueling over authorship. In the end, Democrat
Dennis Cardoza of Merced and Republican Anthony Peschetti of Rancho
Cordova shared the credit. But Cardoza's name came first because his
party controls the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a break from the fight over a new state budget, lawmakers
spent an hour speechifying about the resolution, which urged the U.S.
Supreme Court to immediately overturn the ruling. It ultimately
passed on a 69-0 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino) lambasted the 9th
Circuit as "a rogue court," while Assemblyman Rod Pacheco
(R-Riverside) called the decision "a moral affront" and further proof
that society is "so lost that we chase God from every institution,
from every scrap of paper, from every pledge we make as citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Longville (D-Rialto) was one of only a few
legislators who raised doubts about a "pandering" political reaction:
"We're just falling all over ourselves to say I'm holier than thou,"
said Longville, who abstained from the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Few seemed to share Longville's qualms. Indeed, the bipartisan
outcry is a measure of how politicians in the post-Sept. 11 climate
are hypersensitive about expressing patriotism and condemning
anything that might appear to threaten traditional American values.</TE>
<TE>   For Democrats, the episode also stirs painful memories of the 1988
presidential campaign, when the flag became the most potent symbol of
former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' loss to former President
George Bush.</TE>
<TE>   During his first term as governor, Dukakis vetoed a bill that
would have required teachers to lead their classes in the pledge each
day. Bush hammered his opponent on the issue at virtually every
campaign stop, most memorably at a flag-making factory in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Democrats were determined never to be out-flagged, as
it were.</TE>
<TE>   Red, white and blue became standard at virtually every party
affair--from the smallest state gathering to the nationally broadcast
nominating conventions--and the pledge became as much a fixture as
invocations of John F. Kennedy and Franklin Roosevelt, and the
singing of the old party theme song "Happy Days Are Here Again."</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts disagreed Thursday over whether the ruling
could work to one party's advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans and social conservatives are thanking God for the
pledge ruling," said John J. Pitney Jr., a professor of government at
Claremont McKenna College. He called it "a great issue for
conservative fund-raising letters."</TE>
<TE>   But Marshall Wittmann, an analyst at the Hudson Institute, a
conservative think tank, said he was skeptical about the issue's
potential to benefit Republicans "because Democrats were falling over
themselves expressing their own outrage."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers James Gerstenzang and Dan Morain contributed
to this report.</TE>

<LD>The biggest reason Californians paid $7 billion more for electricity
in the summer of 2000 was the ability of power suppliers to ask for
and get high prices, says a new study by university economists.</LD>
<LD>   Severin Borenstein and James Bushnell of the UC Energy Institute
and Frank Wolak of Stanford University concluded that 59% of the
run-up in power prices was attributable to "market power."</LD>
<LD>   In analyzing data from June 1998 to October 2000, the economists
found that 21% of the increase was due to production costs, such as
rising natural gas prices.</LD>

<LD>An appeals court ruled Thursday that state HMO regulators cannot
force Kaiser Permanente to pay for the anti-impotence drug Viagra,
upholding a lower court ruling.</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Managed Health Care had argued that
the law required health plans to cover all medically necessary
prescription drugs for members if the HMO chose to offer any drug
coverage at all.</LD>
<LD>   The appeals panel said agency officials misinterpreted state law
and that health plans can decide which drugs to offer members, except
in certain cases. Among drugs that must be covered are painkillers
for the terminally ill, contraceptives for women, an AIDS vaccine and
insulin for diabetics.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>County officials are giving deputies a 12% raise to stop them from
leaving the Sheriff's Department for higher-paying agencies. The
problem is so serious that the deputies' union didn't have to reopen
negotiations with the county.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's administrators explained the dire situation to county
officials last week, and the decision was made to offer a raise.
Supervisors are expected to formally approve the move July 9.</LD>
<LD>   The department has 30 vacancies, which has forced deputies to be
pulled off special assignments and put back on patrol duty. About a
third of the openings were caused by retirements and military leave,
but half the deputies left for other agencies.</LD>

<LD>Roadside emergency phones will become fewer and farther between along
Bay Area highways under a plan approved by the region's
transportation agency.</LD>
<LD>   The Metropolitan Transportation Commission voted to remove about
1,350 emergency call boxes on the advice of the agency's freeway and
expressway service panel.</LD>
<LD>   The first phones could be disconnected as soon as July, leaving
behind 2,150 and saving the agency about $4.7 million over five
years. Fewer motorists use the phones because more are using cell
phones in emergencies.</LD>

<HD>Valley Secession Gets Support of 6 Business Groups</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: The breakup campaign, however, may be dealt a
setback today when about 20 black leaders announce their opposition
to splitting Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The campaign for San Fernando Valley secession said Thursday it has
won the support of a half-dozen business organizations, but the
breakup effort is expected to suffer a setback today when more than
20 African American leaders come out against splitting Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Valley cityhood also was endorsed Thursday by the Sherman Oaks
Homeowners Assn. The association's president, Richard Close, is head
of the secession group Valley VOTE.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly, there is momentum," Close said, adding that the
association represents 2,700 families. "Now that we have all the
facts, groups throughout the Valley are reviewing [secession], and I
think most will endorse it."</LD>
<TE>   Valley VOTE released a list of supporters Thursday that included
chambers of commerce in Chatsworth / Porter Ranch, Encino,
Northridge, Canoga Park / West Hills and Agoura.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the list is the San Fernando Valley Business and
Professional Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chatsworth community has long been frustrated with our
current representation from downtown because they are not taking care
of our local priorities," said Allen Glazer, president of the
Chatsworth / Porter Ranch chamber of commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists have worked hard to get the backing of prominent
African Americans, but with little success.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) and Geraldine
Washington, president of the L.A. chapter of the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Colored People, are among those scheduled to hold
a news conference to announce their opposition to secession. Others
include the Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray and the Rev. Leonard Jackson,
pastor and associate pastor, respectively, of the First African
Methodist Episcopal Church.</TE>
<TE>   Secession, said Jackson, "would erode our tax base."</TE>
<TE>   Secession measures for the Valley and Hollywood will be on the
Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secessionists said Thursday they have crafted a plan,
with the help of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, to create seven council districts in a new Hollywood city
within two years if the secession measure is approved.</TE>
<TE>   "We are delighted that MALDEF assisted us in creating these
districts," Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   MALDEF had opposed a plan for at-large elections, saying it would
dilute Latino voter strength.</TE>

<LD>A Pacoima elementary school principal who angered Latino parents by
requesting that only English be spoken on campus has requested a
transfer, school district officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Stannis Steinbeck will serve her last day as principal of Telfair
Elementary School on July 5, when the academic year ends, and then
will be reassigned, possibly as a principal, said Judy Burton, the
Los Angeles Unified School District's superintendent for the
northeast San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Telfair, one of the district's lowest performing schools, has had
three principals in the last four years. Steinbeck got into a spat
with parents last month after she asked some Spanish-speaking parents
to use only English.</LD>
<TE>   Parents accused Steinbeck of being insensitive, but Burton said
the district had no intention of moving the principal had she not
requested the transfer. Burton said Telfair has been plagued by
inconsistent leadership and infighting among faculty.</TE>

<HD>Sierra Plan May Get Cut Down</HD>
<DH>Environment: The Forest Service plans to hire scientists to
examine Clinton-era protections against timbering and grazing in the
range.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SIERRA NATIONAL FOREST</DL>
<LD>Sending its strongest signals yet that it is moving to weaken new
protections for wildlife and old-growth forests in the Sierra Nevada
range, the Bush administration is hiring an outside team of
scientists to reevaluate existing environmental policies.</LD>
<LD>   In comments during a daylong field trip Wednesday with ranchers,
outfitters and environmentalists, Pacific Southwest Regional Forester
Jack Blackwell underscored the administration's unease with
restrictions, adopted as part of a Sierra Nevada plan in the final
days of the Clinton administration.</LD>
<LD>   Blackwell, a U.S. Forest Service veteran appointed seven months
ago, questioned whether timber-cutting limits were too severe and if
the plan's emphasis on controlled burns to reduce the threat of
wildfire was workable.</LD>
<TE>   He said his office would contract with a high-level group of
scientists to review the new guidelines. "We think there is strong
value in getting good scientists together and answering policy
questions for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The product of extensive scientific study and revision, the Sierra
Nevada plan was intended to replace patch-work management of 11.5
million acres of national forest land and stem environmental decline
across the length of the range. The plan placed greater restrictions
on logging, curtailed grazing and recreation near streams, and
protected the nesting sites and dens of rare animals.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell said he wanted neither to gut the Sierra Nevada
plan--the general outlines of which have been upheld on appeal by his
bosses--nor let it stand as is. "I'm not one that wants to blow it up
and start from scratch," he said. "Let's not throw it out the door,
but improve it."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ash, who is heading the Forest Service team reviewing the
Sierra protections, said four to six scientists would be contracted
to answer a list of policy questions and then would present their
recommendations at a public meeting, probably in the early fall.</TE>
<TE>   Current Sierra protections were applauded by environmentalists and
denounced by timber and off-road recreation interests and by ranchers
who fear losing grazing access to high meadows.</TE>
<TE>   A provision that has drawn particular attention directs the Forest
Service to primarily use deliberately set, controlled burns rather
than timber cutting to remove dense growth and reduce fire hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Citing that policy, Blackwell expressed doubts that the Forest
Service could secure all the air-quality permits necessary to conduct
a large number of controlled burns. Even if it did obtain them, he
wondered whether the public would tolerate smoke from the prescribed
fires. He also questioned whether the Sierra protections would allow
the Forest Service to carry out a national fire plan that calls for
the government to reduce the wildfire threat in federal forests.</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, foresters were finding it difficult to observe
tree-cutting limits designed to protect wildlife habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredibly complex. There are unresolved questions about how
it will work and whether we can understand it and the public will
understand it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire managers are telling him, Blackwell added, that they would
like to thin stands to a somewhat greater extent than allowed in
parts of the forests under the wildlife protections.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell's plans to hire an outside group of scientists was
immediately criticized by environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "Contracting with an outside team will give them all the
ammunition they need to undermine the entire plan--should they choose
to--and it really tips their hand," said Jay Watson, the Wilderness
Society's regional director who was on the field trip. "Nothing is
black-and-white in land management and resource science. You could
easily find five scientists who say [the Sierra plan] is too
protective and restrictive."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's field trip into the Sierra National Forest northeast
of Fresno was one of a series Blackwell is conducting to examine
various aspects of the Sierra protections. While top Forest Service
officials rejected appeals of the blueprint earlier this year, they
asked Blackwell to review it and left the door open for changes.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 people from the Forest Service and various interest
groups traveled to two high Sierra meadows to talk about grazing
restrictions that were adopted to protect the willow flycatcher and
Yosemite toad. There were ranchers and pack outfitters clad in boots
and cowboy shirts and environmental advocates wearing hiking boots
and sandals.</TE>
<TE>   The ranchers use high meadows for summer cattle grazing and the
outfitters use them for grazing horses on pack trips. The willow
flycatcher, a small bird on the state endangered-species list, is
seen in dense clumps of willows that grow in wet meadows.</TE>
<TE>   The Yosemite toad, which is found only in the Sierra and is in
decline, breeds in the meadows.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the toad and the flycatcher--once abundant in
California and now numbering fewer than 200 breeding pairs in the
entire state--the Sierra plan bans or limits grazing in the meadows
where they are found.</TE>
<TE>   Within the 38,000-acre grazing allotment that rancher Ben Kimbler
leases in the Sierra National Forest, there are 17 places where the
Yosemite toad has been found.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing at a map of toad habitat, Kimbler plaintively told the
group, "I got 17 red dots on my permit. I can't fence 17 spots.
Economically it's not viable, and I probably wouldn't have a whole
lot left [to graze]."</TE>
<TE>   A third-generation rancher whose grandfather grazed cattle on the
same land in the 1950s, Kimbler later said he was at a loss as to how
he could keep his 100 pairs of cows and calves out of toad habitat.
"The cattle travel too much. It's too tight an area."</TE>
<TE>   Such are the conflicts that have to be resolved throughout the
Sierra. No one suggested Wednesday that the cattlemen or the toad
should be driven from the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   But it also wasn't immediately clear how both can coexist.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists insisted there were answers and urged the Forest
Service to find them.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to find areas that are trouble spots and work on them,"
said Sussan Britting of the Sierra Nevada Forest Protection Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see [the protections] as not implement-able. We have to
work out the kinks."</TE>

<HD>Teachers Lose Bid to End Class-Upsizing Plan</HD>
<DH>Schools: Panel rejects union's demand but studies whether
L.A. Unified's proposal breaks labor pacts. If disallowed, board
gives Romer OK to cut salaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state public employees commission on Thursday denied a demand from
the teachers union to immediately halt the Los Angeles Unified School
District's plans to increase class sizes as a way to save $70 million
for the upcoming school year.</LD>
<LD>   But the state panel has yet to rule whether the district's
proposal to have 40 students in many middle- and high school classes
violates labor contracts.</LD>
<LD>   Robin Wesley, a staff attorney for the state Public Employment
Relations Board, said United Teachers-Los Angeles had not proved the
need for quick action. But she said there "still may be some merit"
in the union's claim that the district must negotiate any rise in the
number of students per class. No date was scheduled for a ruling,
which can then be appealed administratively and then in court, Wesley
said.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the school board prepared to take drastic measures if
the state panel prevents the district from increasing class sizes by
two students in most classes in grades 4 through 12.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, board members voted 5 to 2 to grant Supt. Roy Romer
the authority to strip money from teachers' and administrators'
salaries and benefits for next year in lieu of the savings that
larger classes would produce. Romer said he was also concerned about
additional shortfalls in state funding. The action increased tension
between the board and the teachers union during salary negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Among other budget cuts, the district voted in April to increase
class sizes so that fourth- and fifth-grade classes would average
between 32 and 38 students; the average size of middle school classes
would increase to 41 students; high school classes would range from
32 to more than 40.</TE>
<TE>   Romer argued Thursday that he needed the authority to cut
teachers' pay before Monday when state law locks in salaries. He said
that he had to return to the board for approval before he exercised
his new authority and that no cuts would be made unless they were
absolutely necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get into further cuts, we're not just going to look at this
source only," said Romer. "I want to, at all costs, avoid it--and I
would like to still find funds to make sure that benefits are paid
and salaries are competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Voting against the action were board members Julie Korenstein and
David Tokofsky, who said Romer should have notified the board of the
deadline earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Members who supported the new authority for Romer said they
approved it as a safeguard they hope won't be used.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is definitely the most prudent move to prepare for a
worst-case scenario," said board member Mike Lansing.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, did not please the teachers union, which is
starting to threaten a strike if health coverage is reduced.</TE>
<TE>   "If what the district is trying to do is send us a message that
they're playing hardball, it's just going to anger the teachers,"
said Day Higuchi, outgoing president of United Teachers-Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The district is trying to reduce spending by $430 million this
year and has $9.7 million in cuts to go from its $5.9-billion general
fund budget. But that does not include an estimated $30 million that
Romer said he needs to be able to provide health coverage next year.</TE>
<TE>   Union members have been the most outspoken critics of the
increases in class size, saying that those will roll back students'
recent standardized test score gains.</TE>
<TE>   But two recent studies place more importance on well-trained
teachers than on having fewer students per classroom.</TE>
<TE>   A report by the Public Policy Institute of California went as far
as to say that mandatory class size reductions in lower grades
statewide actually led to poorer academic outcomes in some Los
Angeles schools because the district hired more unqualified teachers
to cover more classes.</TE>

<HD>Tackling Neighborhoods' Little Woes Before They Grow Large</HD>
<DH>The L.A. city attorney's office has 18 prosecutors working
with residents and police on petty violations that erode the quality
of life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unkempt fraternity house on the corner was a nagging reminder to
Northridge homeowners of the peaceful existence they led before Pi
Kappa Phi moved into their neighborhood more than a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, residents complained about the fraternity's loud
parties and trashy surroundings to Los Angeles police and city
officials. But their troubles lingered without permanent resolution.</LD>
<LD>   This month, an energetic young deputy Los Angeles city attorney
named Anthony Paul "A.P." Diaz successfully prosecuted the owner of
the fraternity house for a municipal code violation committed by his
tenants.</LD>
<TE>   The owner pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. Under the terms of his
probation, he may no longer use his property as a fraternity house or
to host large parties.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, the community calls police, but then they are
left with: 'What do we do next?' " said Diaz, one of City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo's 18 new "neighborhood prosecutors."</TE>
<TE>   "Police officers spend most of the time responding to immediate
calls," Diaz said. "What we can deal with is the aftermath."</TE>
<TE>   In seeking to resolve quality-of-life issues, Diaz also is working
with police and city officials to try to stop street racing in
Chatsworth and drug dealing on North Hills' streets.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo launched the Neighborhood Prosecution Project in March,
transferring veteran prosecutors to work with police and residents to
solve minor problems before they lead to larger ones.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council funded the program for a year, providing one
neighborhood prosecutor for each police district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's little by little that things erode," said Mary McGuire, a
spokeswoman for Delgadillo. "That's when the bigger crimes come in."</TE>
<TE>   About half of the county prosecutors' offices nationwide engage in
this preventive practice commonly known as community prosecution,
according to a recent survey by the American Prosecutors Research
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Community prosecutors have worked in the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office since 1993, when they began by responding
to neighborhood complaints about gang activity with injunctions to
stop known gang members from associating in public, said Michael
Yglecias, head deputy in charge of the unit. The district attorney's
20 community prosecutors work with sheriff's deputies in
unincorporated areas of the county and with local police in smaller
cities.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 1990, there were just two such programs in the
nation, said Mike Kuykendall, director of the National Center for
Community Prosecution. The most recent converts, he said, are local
city attorney's offices, such as Delgadillo's.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the nation's first community prosecutors in Portland,
Ore., Kuykendall said, "I learned I could do more outside of the
courtroom than in it."</TE>
<TE>   With the community's help, he said, he shut down drug houses where
many of the crimes were considered too low-level for police and
courts to do much about.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, prosecutors don't get involved in a community
problem until police have investigated and filed criminal charges.
This new approach encourages them to use existing tools, such as
nuisance abatement laws, to improve safety, Kuykendall said.</TE>
<TE>   After four years in a downtown Los Angeles trial court, Diaz, 31,
applied to work in the new program. He is assigned full time to the
Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division, where his desk
is in a trailer alongside nine senior lead officers.</TE>
<TE>   The Loyola Law School graduate leaves his sport coat at the office
when he gets in a patrol car to visit neighbors. He wears a
prosecutor's badge on his belt and works from a cell phone and laptop
computer. He talks to residents about problems such as junk cars and
music blaring from illegal home recording studios.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the job that Rocky [Delgadillo] wants us to do is come
up with nontraditional approaches to solving crimes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Driving down Parthenia Street, Diaz points to an ice cream factory
as an early success. Neighbors complained that the owner held big
parties on weekends and charged an admission fee. Diaz said that he
met with the owner and that within two weeks the parties stopped.</TE>
<TE>   At a neighborhood watch meeting last month in Panorama City, Diaz
urged members to call him whenever they see an abandoned car on the
street, or a sofa or bathtub dumped in a vacant lot.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to come up with creative solutions to solve crimes," he
told the dozen or so residents.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz said he will try to solve a community problem by talking to
property owners or asking other city agencies to act. But he has a
strong weapon, whenever it's needed. "I always have the power to file
criminal charges," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's one way that Diaz has helped residents of Sherwood Forest,
a neighborhood that adjoins the Cal State Northridge campus and has
been home to Pi Kappa Phi members.</TE>
<TE>   In February, police in riot gear dispersed a crowd of more than
1,000 people that had spilled out into the street and onto neighbors'
lawns at the fraternity's back-to-school bash.</TE>
<TE>   After years of complaining, neighbors were demanding results.
"That was it," said Jack McGrath, who lives on Zelzah Avenue, half a
block from the residence that has served as the Pi Kappa Phi house.
"We've had it."</TE>
<TE>   Within days, Diaz met with McGrath and the others. Together, they
testified at a Cal State Northridge Interfraternity Council hearing,
where Pi Kappa Phi was sanctioned.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions imposed at the hearing included an order that members
attend monthly homeowners meetings and volunteer eight hours a month
in the neighborhood, said Jamison Keller, activities coordinator at
the university.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, many of the residents have been very hesitant" to
testify against the fraternity in campus proceedings, Keller said.
"They were scared of retaliation."</TE>
<TE>   Having Diaz involved "gives the people in the neighborhood a lot
of confidence," McGrath agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Joey Catlin, the fraternity's president, said his members are
trying to become better neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing everything that we can," he said, from painting the
outside of the one-story ranch-style house to reducing the number of
live-in residents to four.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just trying to keep it up and keep it clean so it fits
into the community," Catlin said. "We want to stay there."</TE>
<TE>   Catlin's landlord, Hamid Helmandi, was charged in mid-May with two
misdemeanors for trash accumulation on the property and for using the
land for a fraternity house without a conditional use permit.
Helmandi, who pleaded guilty last week to the trash charge, could not
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Under the court agreement, four fraternity members can continue to
live in the house at one time, but the home cannot serve as a
fraternity headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz's next project is to try to end street racing in a commercial
area of Plummer Street between Canoga Avenue and Topanga Canyon
Boulevard, where hundreds of people gather for races.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Senior Lead Officer Ken Cioffi said he has been struggling
with the problem for years. His request to the California Department
of Transportation to install speed bumps was rejected because they
are permitted in residential areas only.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing I could do was put up no-parking signs," he said.
"I kept getting shot down."</TE>
<TE>   Now Cioffi has a new ally in Diaz, who has studied the problem and
alternatives to speed bumps. "I felt like an engineer for a week,"
Diaz said.</TE>

<HD>Trade School Odometer Hits 1,000</HD>
<DH>Education: Center for auto-repair training has helped 1,000
people begin a career. Unlike other post-riot efforts, it's going
strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was, at its core, a trade school commencement, a final hurrah for
graduates ready to start $9-an-hour jobs at auto repair shops. But in
Central Los Angeles 10 years after the riots, the ceremony was enough
to draw two former Cabinet members from both parties--Alexis Herman,
labor secretary in the Clinton administration, and Jack Kemp, housing
secretary under former President Bush and 1996 vice presidential
candidate--as well as television news cameras and a coterie of local
politicians.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Urban League Automotive Training Center on
Thursday handed out certificates to 92 men and four women who
completed free training programs in auto maintenance. With that group
of graduates, the center has now trained 1,000 students since it
opened in April 1993 as a partnership of the Urban League and Toyota
to help Los Angeles recover from the 1992 riots.</LD>
<LD>   That record of success aside, the South Crenshaw Boulevard center
is a magnet for the media and politicians for another reason: It is a
rare example of a post-1992 riot recovery program that met its goals
and still exists.</LD>
<TE>   In the decade after the riots, programs such as the corporate-led
Rebuild L.A. were criticized for failing to deliver on lofty promises
of inner-city jobs and business growth.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the graduates, Los Angeles Urban League President John
Mack noted that "a lot of people made promises [after the riots]....
They came in and said they wanted to save South Central ... then they
went away." But "Toyota kept its promise and stayed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The program targets unemployed or underemployed workers and
provides training for up to 12 weeks in general maintenance, tuneups,
and brake and suspension work.</TE>
<TE>   Former Labor Secretary Herman told the graduates the entry-level
jobs they would start will "propel you even further" to successful
careers. Herman also emphasized the importance of "being responsible
in your personal lives."</TE>
<TE>   That theme was repeated by Gary Taylor, a 2000 graduate who
entered the training class from a drug rehabilitation program.
Taylor, 48, told the graduating class he decided to honestly answer
job application questions about drug use and felony convictions, and
spoke openly about his past in job interviews. He said that by
displaying integrity and self-discipline, he was able to quickly rise
from mopping floors to an assistant service manager position at
Torrance Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Despite individual success stories such as Taylor's, even
supporters of the training center are aware that Los Angeles needs
much more to recover from the loss of high-wage jobs in the area in
the last two decades. Recent Census data showed median income in Los
Angeles dropped from 1990 to 2000, unlike most other U.S.
metropolitan areas.</TE>
<TE>   Former HUD Secretary Kemp said the Urban League program "is not a
substitute" for well-paying manufacturing jobs but "is something that
should be emulated by other companies."</TE>
<TE>   The city's incomplete recovery from the 1992 riots is obvious just
outside the Crenshaw Boulevard academy, built on the site of a former
car dealership. A new Sav-On drugstore has come up next to the
center, but across the street, another former car dealership has been
vacant for years, and the Holiday Bowl, once a thriving center for
African American and Japanese American communities, remains
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas West, senior vice president of Toyota Motor North America,
said the company has spent more than $8 million on the training
center since it opened. West said the program is useful to the
industry because entry-level service jobs are "typically filled by
people with virtually no experience," resulting in a costly turnover
rate.</TE>
<TE>   Urban League officials said the program has consistently placed
80% of its graduates in jobs at various auto dealers and service
shops. In addition to Toyota, other auto manufacturers and dealers
have supported the program by supplying equipment or hiring
graduates.</TE>
<TE>   The program has been the subject of dozens of news stories and was
even visited by Britain's Prince Charles in 1994. It helped Toyota
avoid a serious image problem in the early 1990s, said Steven
Clemons, who was director of the Japan-America Society of Southern
California until 1993.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to anti-Japanese sentiments fueled by large trade
deficits, Toyota had faced allegations of racism in its use of parts
suppliers, Clemons said. "It got to be nasty for a while, and Toyota
to its credit put into place a lot of programs that did good and were
good PR."</TE>

<HD>Defense Accuses Ex-Husband of Years of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Court: Santokh Virk denies beating his former wife or
isolating her from family and friends. She is on trial for allegedly
trying to drown their children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawyer for a distraught Port Hueneme mother charged with trying to
drown her two children accused the woman's ex-husband Thursday of
abuse so severe it drove her client to the brink of insanity.</LD>
<LD>   "You abused her for 20 years, isn't that true?" asked Deputy
Public Defender Cynthia Ellington.</LD>
<LD>   But liquor store owner Santokh Virk denied that he beat his
ex-wife, Narinder Virk, and disputed defense allegations that he
isolated her in the family's Port Hueneme apartment by cutting off
her contact with their family and friends.</LD>
<TE>   Santokh Virk took the witness stand for a second day Thursday in
the trial of his former spouse.</TE>
<TE>   Narinder Virk faces two counts of attempted murder for allegedly
trying to drown the couple's son and daughter, then ages 9 and 6, in
Channel Islands Harbor on Jan. 12, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   She has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   Mental Breakdown</TE>
<TE>   Ellington told jurors in her opening statement earlier this week
that Narinder Virk was "brutalized" by her former spouse and suffered
a mental breakdown on the night of the alleged drowning attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The defense is expected to open its case today with testimony from
medical experts who examined the 42-year-old defendant after her
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's court proceedings, Ellington attacked Santokh
Virk's credibility and questioned him at length about his marriage to
Narinder Virk.</TE>
<TE>   The couple wed in India in the late 1970s. Santokh Virk testified
it was an arranged marriage--and one he tried to end three years ago
after the couple's constant fighting became intolerable.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning Wednesday by the prosecutor, Santokh Virk, 43,
denied that those fights ever turned violent or led to police
involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Police Called to Home</TE>
<TE>   But on cross-examination Thursday, he admitted that police were
called to his home once after his former wife tried to stop him from
leaving their apartment and he threw a suitcase over her head.</TE>
<TE>   "The suitcase never touched her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by Ellington if he ever yelled at his wife, Santokh Virk
admitted that he did, but testified that she always initiated the
screaming matches.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the allegations of physical abuse, Ellington questioned
whether Santokh Virk so tightly controlled his ex-wife that she
suffered a mental breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   The former husband acknowledged that Narinder Virk could not read
or drive a car and barely spoke English.</TE>
<TE>   She had no money of her own, no checking account or credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   And Santokh Virk testified that to wash clothes she would have to
get coins from his truck.</TE>
<TE>   "If she wanted it, I would give her quarters for laundry," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   During a break in the courtroom proceedings, Senior Deputy Dist.
Atty. Richard Simon objected to Ellington's line of questioning.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is on trial?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   But Superior Court Judge Ken Riley said he would allow Ellington
to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Poisoning Allegation</TE>
<TE>   At one point Thursday, Ellington asked Santokh Virk whether he had
ever accused Narinder Virk of trying to poison him.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had not.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ellington showed him a sworn declaration from divorce court
in which he made that accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Santokh Virk admitted that the poisoning accusation may have been
a lie, but he told jurors: "It might be possible, too."</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today.</TE>

<LD>A 24-year-old Camarillo woman has been arrested on suspicion of
telephoning a fake bomb threat to county offices in Oxnard, allegedly
to avoid meeting with her probation officer.</LD>
<LD>   Diana Gomez is suspected of making the threat to probation offices
on April 15. At the time Gomez was being sought on a warrant for
failing to meet with her probation officer and as a result knew she
would be arrested if she attended the meeting, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Probation offices were evacuated after the threat was received,
disrupting activity for several hours. Monitoring equipment at the
offices tracked the call to a Camarillo house where Gomez was
staying, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Gomez was taken into custody Wednesday at probation offices after
complying with another request to attend a meeting, police said. She
posted an unspecified bail late Wednesday, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>A Center Built With a Dream</HD>
<DH>Opening: Watts facility will bear the name of its
godfather, who died earlier this month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was impossible to separate Roy Roberts II from the new brick and
glass building that had been his dream. For more than 10 years, he
struggled to give the children of Watts a new community center to
replace the old one.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone tried to smile when they cut the red ribbon to dedicate
the new Boys &amp; Girls Club on Thursday morning, but a note of sadness
lingered because Roberts wasn't holding the scissors.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts died of a heart attack June 3, three weeks before the
doors were flung open and a community he'd served for 27 years was
allowed inside.</LD>
<TE>   Jose Luviano, a 21-year-old Air Force senior airman was halfway
through his speech about the old center and "Mr. Roy" when tears
stole his voice. A pair of hands landed on Luviano's shoulders, the
audience applauded, and he continued.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Roy's dream will live on," he said. "And that alone is enough
to put a smile on a soldier's face."</TE>
<TE>   Luviano, who recently returned from an assignment in Kyrgyzstan
for Operation Enduring Freedom, later recounted the afternoons spent
playing basketball, dodging falling ceiling tiles. There were worse
things on the streets, like gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The club was always "a place where you didn't have to worry about
much," he said. "Mr. Roy kept everybody focused on the big
picture."Days after Roberts died, the club's board of directors
decided the new 28,000-square-foot building should bear Roberts' name
along with its formal name, the S. Mark Taper Foundation Youth
Center.</TE>
<TE>   At the dedication, a temporary banner touted the Roy W. Roberts II
Watts/Willowbrook Boys &amp; Girls Club.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time Roberts forced a name change. In 1975,
shortly after he was hired as the club's executive director, women
finally were allowed to join the club, which opened in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Williams, who has taught the club's quilting class, said
before then, "the girls were always peeking around, trying to get in.
And of course, the boys were always looking back at them."</TE>
<TE>   Williams and about 200 others toured the arts and crafts room, the
exercise room, as well as the computer lab and library.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty still is missing from the new building, which was built
piecemeal as Roberts and others raised money.</TE>
<TE>   They broke ground in 1999, but the new building could not open
until Roberts and his staff raised $5.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   When it officially opens July 8, it will have cost roughly $7.2
million, but the club hopes to go from serving roughly 1,000 area
youngsters per year to at least 4,000.</TE>
<TE>   Rising costs always seemed to outpace Roberts' fund-raising,
longtime friend and Board President Clif Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Every Wednesday, Roberts would purchase a lottery ticket, hoping a
big win would fill the gap. He never won, but Roberts didn't get
discouraged, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Roberts try to take the credit. Had he been at Thursday's
ceremony he would have been embarrassed by the attention, Johnson
said. His motivation was not for recognition or money or prestige,
but for helping the young people of the Watts area.</TE>
<TE>   "He could've left and gone to higher clubs," Johnson said. "His
desire was to really build this for this community where he'd grown
up."</TE>
<TE>   Shemika Pecot was 14 when "Mr. Roy" started raising money for the
new center. Now 30, she toured the new building that her mentor
constantly talked about.</TE>
<TE>   She took solace in the fact that before he died, Roberts toured
the building once. He inspected every corner, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pecot stood on a second-floor concourse overlooking the newly
waxed indoor basketball court that still doesn't have baskets. There
at the half-court line is the heart of the building--"Roy W. Roberts
II Watts/Willowbrook Boys &amp; Girls Club" in shiny black letters.</TE>

<HD>Philip Whalen, 78; Zen Priest, Mentor Among Beat Poets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Whalen, the burly Zen priest and Beat Generation poet who
played a major role in the San Francisco renaissance of the 1950s and
1960s that radically changed American poetry, died Wednesday at age
78.</LD>
<LD>   Suffering from heart and brain maladies, his eyesight lost to
glaucoma, Whalen spent his final years at a public nursing home in
San Francisco, supported financially and emotionally by his many
admirers and acolytes in the often inseparable worlds of Buddhism and
modern poetry.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a poet's poet," said Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gary
Snyder, a friend of Whalen's since their days at Reed College in
Portland, Ore., in the 1940s. "People looking for subtlety, nuance
and beautiful turns of language looked to Philip. He had a
wonderfully dry sense of humor--ironic, cutting, mocking."</LD>
<TE>   Before his health failed, Whalen was abbot at the Hartford Street
Zen Center in the Castro district of San Francisco and comforted
dying AIDS patients.</TE>
<TE>   Poet-editor Gary Gach said Whalen maintained his wit and
self-deprecating style even when he knew death was imminent. When a
friend asked him whether he wanted a milkshake, he replied, "No, I'd
like what they gave Socrates."</TE>
<TE>   And when friends grew morose at the thought of his passing, he
joked about his funeral: "I'd like to be laid on a bed of frozen
raspberries."</TE>
<TE>   Whalen's poetry melded Eastern and Western traditions, explored
the then-practically unknown concept of environmentalism and
playfully mocked the conformity of U.S. life.</TE>
<TE>   Although his poetic reputation never matched those of Snyder,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gregory Corso or the most famous Beat of them
all, Allen Ginsberg, Whalen influenced the movement as a friend,
confidant and mentor to younger poets.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the ego clashes and sexual romps that were common among the
Beat poets and their many amours, Whalen was a calming, maturing
influence. When poet Kenneth Rexroth blamed the mischief-making Jack
Kerouac for encouraging Rexroth's wife to leave him for poet Robert
Creeley, Whalen played the role of peacemaker and helped the poetic
community survive intact.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a quiet, gentle, scholarly soul who never wanted to be
part of the acclaim or limelight," said Ann Charters, a leading
scholar of the Beat Generation. "He was a dear friend to young poets
and writers, particularly to Kerouac when he was suffering terribly
from alcoholism."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Portland and raised in small towns of the Northwest,
Whalen worked at an airplane factory and a shipyard, served stateside
in the Army during World War II, and used the G.I. Bill to attend
avant-garde Reed, where he roomed with aspiring poets Snyder and Lew
Welch.</TE>
<TE>   Older than most of his fellow students, Whalen introduced them to
the works of Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams and
William Blake.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to San Francisco, he met Ginsberg and Kerouac, "the
first people I thought of as being really literary." He took peyote
and found it a life-altering experience: "All my dopey theories and
hang-ups and things about writing ... suddenly disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   He dropped his efforts to match the formalities and structures of
T.S. Eliot and Stevens and instead became a charter member of what
Kerouac called "a kind of new-old Zen Lunacy poetry, writing whatever
enters into your head as it comes, poetry returned to its origins, in
the bardic child, truly ORAL ... instead of gray faced Academic
quibbling."</TE>
<TE>   Whalen was present for the now-fabled poetry reading at the Six
Gallery in San Francisco in October 1955. There, Ginsberg first read
"Howl," which became the anthem of a movement: "I saw the best minds
of my generation destroyed by madness...."</TE>
<TE>   In mock-seriousness, Whalen read "Plus Ca Change," a put-down of
the reticence of the age.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Listen. Whatever we do from</TE>
<TE>   here on out</TE>
<TE>   Let's for God's sake not look at</TE>
<TE>   each other</TE>
<TE>   Keep our eyes shut and the</TE>
<TE>   lights turned off--</TE>
<TE>   We won't mind touching if we</TE>
<TE>   don't have to see.</TE>
<TE>   I'll ignore those preposterous</TE>
<TE>   feathers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whalen credited "Howl" with liberating him from the strictures of
form and the fear of being self-conscious. In "Sourdough Mountain
Lookout," taken from his experiences as a fire-spotter, he wrote:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outside the lookout I lay nude on</TE>
<TE>   the granite</TE>
<TE>   Mountain hot September sun but</TE>
<TE>   inside my head</TE>
<TE>   Calm dark night with all the</TE>
<TE>   other stars</TE>
<TE>   HERACLITUS: "The Waking</TE>
<TE>   have one common world</TE>
<TE>   But the sleeping turn aside</TE>
<TE>   Each into a world of his own."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After studying in Japan, he became a Zen monk in 1973, took the
name Zenshin Ryufu ("Zen-mind-dragon-wind") and spent two decades at
Zen centers in San Francisco and New Mexico. He wrote more than 20
volumes of poetry, fiction and commentary, although much of his work
has never been published. In "Never Apologize, Never Explain," Whalen
wrote:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A pair of strange new birds in</TE>
<TE>   the maple tree</TE>
<TE>   Peer through the windows</TE>
<TE>   Mother and father visiting me</TE>
<TE>   "You are unmarried</TE>
<TE>   No child begot</TE>
<TE>   Now we are birds, now you've</TE>
<TE>   forgotten us</TE>
<TE>   Although in dreams we visit you</TE>
<TE>   in human shape."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Zen, critics have noted, Whalen found a combination of
discipline and freedom that he had long sought. "The world is wicked
by definition; my job is to stay aware of it," he wrote in "Birthday
Poem."</TE>
<TE>   Histories of the Beat Generation are replete with references to
Whalen. He appears in fictionalized form in two of Kerouac's novels:
as Ben Fagan in "Big Sur" and Warren Coughlin in "Dharma Bums."</TE>
<TE>   Whalen never married; his only known survivor is a sister, Velna
Whalen, of San Diego. A memorial service, organized by the San
Francisco Zen Center/Green Gulch Farm, is planned for September.</TE>
<TE>   In his final days, Whalen's friends, including Beat poets Diane di
Prima and Michael McClure, gathered at his bedside and took turns
reading him his favorite poems. McClure read Chaucer, Robert Burns
and Emily Dickinson.</TE>
<TE>   "He was brilliant and he was grumpy and we loved him," McClure
said. "We all feel very hollow inside. But Phil will not be
forgotten."</TE>

<HD>Timothy White, 50; Editor Revolutionized Billboard Magazine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Timothy White, the editor in chief of Billboard magazine, collapsed
Thursday in his New York City office and died of a heart attack. He
was 50.</LD>
<LD>   White, who had run the music industry's top trade magazine since
1991, was rushed to St. Vincent's Hospital, where he was pronounced
dead.</LD>
<LD>   A giant in music journalism, White rubbed elbows with the
industry's elite and revolutionized the record charts at Billboard
magazine, long considered the industry bible. He also wrote a weekly
column that championed music with artistic merit and chastised
producers of violent and misogynistic records, which he said harmed
the culture.</LD>
<TE>   White's sudden death stunned the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real shock," Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records
and chairman of Palm Pictures, said in a call from London. "It is so
rare to find a guy in his position who loves music as much as he did.
It didn't matter to him whether music was commercial or
noncommercial. He loved it. I knew him well. It is very sad to see
him go."</TE>
<TE>   A Fordham University graduate, White entered the world of
journalism as a copy messenger at Associated Press and worked his way
up to sports and entertainment writer.</TE>
<TE>   He was senior editor of the groundbreaking rock magazine Crawdaddy
from 1977 to 1978 and senior editor at Rolling Stone from 1979 to
1982. He joined Billboard as editor in chief in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   On White's watch, Billboard dramatically revamped its music
charts, employing computerized sales data from SoundScan that
produced the first statistically precise barometer of consumer
tastes. The new charts shocked the industry, showing that fans were
often more fascinated by comparatively unknown rap, metal,
alternative rock and country acts than pompous superstars.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, music companies resisted the change, but the new chart
system ultimately altered the way records were manufactured,
distributed and marketed. Under White, Billboard also implemented
accurate radio airplay charts, using computerized technology that set
a new standard for accuracy in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   White also co-produced his own award-winning nationally syndicated
radio series and wrote biographies on Bob Marley, James Taylor, the
Beach Boys and a recently published selection of his "Music to My
Ears" essays from Billboard.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the music executives who badgered White with complaints
about Billboard's coverage of their companies ended up becoming
friends with him.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, record chiefs from New York to Los Angeles traded
phone calls expressing sadness over his death.</TE>
<TE>   "Timothy was one of the most unique individuals I have ever
known," said Tommy Mottola, chairman of Sony Music Entertainment.
"Integrity and credibility were the core of his essence. The flavor
and editorial style he brought to our industry's premier magazine
will remain indelible. Our industry will feel his loss deeply. I
personally will miss him forever."</TE>
<TE>   White is survived by his wife, Judy, and their 10-year-old twin
sons, Christopher and Alexander. His final column will appear in the
July 6 issue of Billboard, available today.</TE>

<LD>Rival militias fought a fierce battle over the deaths of fellow
clansmen in central Somalia, leaving 23 people dead and 40 wounded
just one day after peace was brokered, officials and witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Using heavy weapons mounted on 10 pickup trucks, more than 300
militiamen from the Saad and Dir clans fought Wednesday in the Golol
Valley, 435 miles northeast of Mogadishu, the capital, residents who
fled said.</LD>
<LD>   The fighting followed a peace deal reached between the clans for
control of Gellinsor village, 170 miles northwest of Mogadishu.</LD>

<LD>A man who broke his arm when he slipped on a greasy bar floor--caused
by a patron who wore pork chops as shoes--has brought home the bacon,
winning more than 60,000 Australian dollars (about $33,600 U.S.) in
compensation.</LD>
<LD>   Troy Michael Bowron, 25, sued the Jannali Inn in southern Sydney,
its owner Kelly Wells and patron Ross Lucock for negligence over the
November 1997 incident.</LD>
<LD>   Bowron claimed Lucock said he was using the pork for shoes after
being told he would not be served more alcohol because he was
barefoot. Lucock had won the meat as part of a raffle at the bar.</LD>
<TE>   The bar and owner were ordered to pay for not cleaning up the
greasy trail, but charges against Lucock were dismissed.</TE>

<HD>Russia Targets Racist Groups</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Seeking to combat hate crimes, the lower house of the Russian
parliament approved a bill Thursday that gives authorities new tools
to outlaw skinhead and neo-Nazi organizations. But human rights
proponents warned that the legislation goes too far and could be
turned against almost any civic association.</LD>
<LD>   The "Law on Preventing Extremist Activities" was pushed through
the State Duma, or lower house, in reaction to a string of racist and
anti-Semitic attacks since April that had prompted protests from the
diplomatic community and aroused the public ire of Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would outlaw extremist groups that preach racial or
national superiority, use Nazi symbols, support armed activities or
call for the violent overthrow of the constitutional order. People
who organize such groups could face up to six years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Under one of the legislation's provisions, local Interior Ministry
officials are empowered to suspend a public organization and freeze
its assets if they conclude that it is extremist. Critics said that
puts too much discretion in the hands of unaccountable bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   "This law allows the closure of public organizations without a
court decision. Think about it: It is a very, very dangerous law,"
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko party, told The
Times on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But one of his own bloc's members, Yuri P. Shchekochikhin, voted
for the bill, saying he hoped it would encourage police to start
taking hate crimes seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "Most European countries have anti-extremist and anti-fascist
laws, and until now we didn't," he said. "We really need one. We
badly need to stop the fast-growing 'fascistization' of the country,
especially among the young people."</TE>
<TE>   The measure had been submitted to the Duma by Putin and passed on
its third reading, 274-145. Most of the dissent came from Communist
Party members and their allies, who feared that they and their
supporters could become victims of the legislation if they stage mass
demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most wary were organizations that frequently find
themselves at loggerheads with the Kremlin.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very deep concerns," said Tatyana I. Kasatkina, executive
director of Memorial, an organization that monitors human rights and
fights for former political prisoners. "We do a lot of work in
Chechnya and can't help but criticize the authorities for their
actions there. And now, we are concerned that the authorities could
declare us an extremist organization and close us down."</TE>
<TE>   The bill still must be approved by the Federation Council, the
upper house of parliament, before going to Putin for his signature.
But it is not expected to encounter serious opposition.</TE>
<TE>   An e-mail threatening violence sent to foreign residents of Moscow
by skinheads in April kept many Africans and Asians off the street
for days and prompted an unusual joint protest by diplomats to the
Foreign Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, there have been a number of racist and anti-Semitic
acts, including the beating of an American rabbi's son, an explosion
of a booby-trapped sign reading "Death to Jews" and the killing of an
Afghan translator.</TE>
<TE>   Vyacheslav Likhachev, author of a new book here titled "Nazism in
Russia," said Thursday that Russia's largest cities, including
Moscow, St. Petersburg, Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod, are home to
thousands of neo-Nazi skinheads.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Working to Fill Its Afghanistan Plate</HD>
<DH>Aid: Food program must raise $285 million to ensure
deliveries through winter. Donors have pledged only two-thirds of the
funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>On his first visit to Afghanistan as chief executive of the World
Food Program on Thursday, James T. Morris gazed intently at the
barren mountainous land as his plane winged toward this northern
city.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a pretty harsh existence here; most of the Western world
doesn't have a clue about the poverty that the rest of the world
struggles with," said the Indiana native, who took the helm of the
large United Nations program 10 weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   He faces a formidable task. Although the imminent disaster that
threatened Afghanistan last year has eased with a break in the
drought and an end to fighting, the country remains in dire need.
About 9 million Afghans--about a third of the population--get their
food each day from the World Food Program. Even with somewhat
improved harvests, that will not change soon.</LD>
<TE>   Morris must raise $285 million this year for Afghanistan alone to
have food through winter. The United States and European countries
have pledged roughly two-thirds of the money, but the rest must be
drummed up in the next few weeks if the WFP is to enter into
contracts to obtain and deliver food in time for winter.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, Morris likes raising money and has a lot of experience
doing it. A businessman with a careful manner, he has been drawn
repeatedly to work on charitable ventures, including a stint as the
president of the Lilly Endowment, one of the largest charitable
organizations in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In a whirlwind day of visits at different WFP projects, he
appeared to be turning over in his mind strategies for getting more
donors involved.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a good story to tell," Morris said. "We've never tried
very hard to raise money in the private sector. We have to be more
creative with nontraditional donors.</TE>
<TE>   "For instance, we have lots of countries willing to give us
commodities, but they can't pay transport and support costs," he
said. "We could take money from private donors to pay for that."</TE>
<TE>   His daylong tour of Afghan provinces made a strong case for the
continuing magnitude of the need. Refugees who fled the country
during the last decade of war are returning in large numbers--more
than 1 million people in the last 16 weeks alone. Most have no homes
or jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The food program gives them a starter kit of blankets, pots,
plates and enough wheat for one to two months, depending on the size
of the family.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the WFP asks that people work in exchange for the
help.</TE>
<TE>   In Mazar-i-Sharif, men dig culverts, lay gravel on roads and level
uneven ground to prepare it for new projects.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, one such project looked like a human anthill. Scores
of men in dusty local dress and goggles chopped away at the
sun-hardened earth to level the site for a playground.</TE>
<TE>   Most had left their homes elsewhere in Afghanistan because of
fighting, a lack of work or both. In most cases, they cannot go back,
because they have no way to support their families.</TE>
<TE>   Food is given outright to children. The program has bakeries that
produce nutrient-fortified bread to be handed out at schools. Parents
who send their children to school are rewarded with cooking oil.
Teachers also receive an additional food ration.</TE>
<TE>   Morris is adamant about the importance of feeding children and
keeping them healthy. More than 10 years ago, he became involved in a
major effort to reduce infant mortality in Indiana. As a member of
the business community, he was able to persuade insurance companies,
hospitals, nurses and others to join the fight to reduce the
magnitude of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our work is related to infant mortality, so thinking
back on that experience, it was prophetic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's one thing that people around the world agree with," he
said, "it's that children should not be hungry, especially when they
are in situations that are not of their own making."</TE>

<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>Gun battles, a grenade attack and other violence Thursday in the
Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir killed at least nine
people--including three soldiers and two policemen--and wounded about
30, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers were killed when guerrillas attacked their army
vehicle in Chandanwari, 70 miles south of Srinagar, the summer
capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, army officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Suspected Islamic militants opened fire on a police car in the
Srinagar suburb of Soura, where the police were conducting a routine
inspection of vehicles. Two officers were killed in the gunfire,
which injured another officer and two civilians.</LD>
<TE>   On the outskirts of Anantnag, 35 miles south of Srinagar, three
suspected militants were killed in a gun battle with paramilitary
soldiers that left two of the soldiers wounded, police said.</TE>
<TE>   In another skirmish, a militant was killed by Border Security
Force soldiers in Pulwama, a security force spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, suspected Islamic militants hurled a grenade into a crowded
market in Anantnag. The explosion injured 20 civilians and five
paramilitary soldiers, a local police officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, a bomb
exploded on a train, wounding at least 11 people, officials said. The
explosion took place in a passenger car as the train neared the
station of Chandrapura, 25 miles north of Ranchi, the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen Muslim guerrilla groups have been fighting since
1989 for the independence of Kashmir or the merger of its
Indian-controlled portion with Islamic Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir is
the only Muslim-majority state in mostly Hindu India.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes said Thursday that
hundreds of thousands of troops would remain posted along the border
with Pakistan for at least four more months.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot withdraw the forces until elections in Jammu and
Kashmir are over, and after that the decision depends on the
situation," Fernandes said.</TE>

<HD>Fugitives Under Fire in Hebron</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli helicopters fired missiles Thursday at wanted men holed up in
a Palestinian Authority compound in the West Bank city of Hebron, as
Palestinian officials fumed over threats from President Bush to deny
future aid.</LD>
<LD>   The United States provides no direct funding to the Palestinian
Authority, but it has funneled millions of dollars in aid to
humanitarian and development projects.</LD>
<LD>   "Delaying aid from the international community would also delay
the reforms that we already have started within most of our
organizations and sectors," West Bank security chief Jibril Rajoub
said.</LD>
<TE>   Smoke rose Thursday from the Hebron complex after the missile
strike. Israeli forces had been targeting the building with
machine-gun fire for three days and warned that they would overrun it
if those inside refused to come out.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military officials have said 150 people inside the
compound have surrendered, including at least 20 top fugitives. About
40 people, including at least 15 wanted men, remained inside, the
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel also admitted that for the second time in a week, its
forces had "acted improperly" in firing on Palestinians violating a
curfew. Three children in the West Bank town of Kalkilya were wounded
Thursday, including a boy who was in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the talk Thursday was angry reaction to Bush's plan
for bringing peace to the region, laid out Monday. It centered on a
call for new Palestinian leaders "not compromised by terror." Since
then, Bush has also threatened to deny U.S. aid to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "It's enough for the Palestinians to face an [Israeli] army armed
with all the American weapons," said Palestinian Authority Cabinet
Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Italy joined the call for new Palestinian leadership.
"Many people are convinced that Arafat ... should make a generous
gesture and move aside," Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
said at the G-8 summit in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In Khartoum, Sudan, meanwhile, representatives of 57 Muslim
nations pledged support for Palestinians in a resolution that made no
mention of Bush's call for new leadership. The resolution was adopted
at the end of a three-day meeting of foreign ministers and senior
officials.</TE>

<HD>Criticism Flies Over Musharraf Proposals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, faced a torrent of
criticism Thursday over proposed constitutional changes that would
give him sweeping powers to sack a civilian prime minister, fire the
Cabinet and dissolve an elected parliament.</LD>
<LD>   The draft of constitutional amendments, presented as a package for
national debate, includes plans for a 10-member National Security
Council of generals and civilians headed by Musharraf.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition parties gearing up for National Assembly elections in
October rejected the proposals, billed by the government as a
blueprint for "sustainable federal democracy," as a transparent
attempt to cement the generals' control.</LD>
<TE>   "Far from making democracy sustainable, the document released by
the junta ... if implemented, will ring the death knell of democracy
in the country," the Pakistan People's Party of former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistan Muslim League led by exiled former Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, the man Musharraf ousted in 1999, called the draft
amendments a recipe for disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The country's Bar Council, its highest body of lawyers, said
members would meet in Lahore on July 6 to discuss fighting the
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, said
Musharraf would be shedding powers to the National Security Council
if the amendments passed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pakistan sent 100 more soldiers into the mountains
along the border with Afghanistan on Thursday to join the search for
40 suspected Al Qaeda fighters believed to be hiding among the armed
tribesmen in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The troops, backed by helicopters and armored vehicles, joined
more than 500 soldiers who have been in the area since Wednesday,
when gunmen opened fire on Pakistani soldiers, killing 10.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi said soldiers had arrested "some Al Qaeda men" since
Wednesday morning. It was unclear if those arrested were linked to
Wednesday's attack.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Raid on Village Revives the Specter of an Old Enemy</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: American troops rounded up men and munitions
in the middle of the night, reminding some of Soviet occupiers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KOURMASHY, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>An American military raid last weekend on this village near the
eastern town of Gardez has left area residents shaken, confused and,
above all, angry.</LD>
<LD>   For locals, the incident seems reminiscent of the tactics used by
the Russian troops who occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s: forced
entrance into homes, detentions and the seizure of property.</LD>
<LD>   Their assessment explains some of the difficulties that the United
States faces in its military mission in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   "It is harmful to the Americans when they do these things. People
will begin to hate them the way they hated other governments that
tried to dominate them," said Abdullah Mujahed, the commander
responsible for security for Gardez.</TE>
<TE>   Raids such as the one in Kourmashy may be yielding significant
gains in the war against terrorism. That is difficult to know, given
the limited information released by the U.S. military. However, it is
certain that any benefits come at a high cost in terms of American
credibility among Afghans whose allegiance is up for grabs in this
largely untamed border region.</TE>
<TE>   Gardez and the surrounding area are near the site of Operation
Anaconda, the largest ground battle fought by U.S. troops in the
Afghan war. Many people who supported the Taliban live here, and it
is unclear to what extent they now back the Americans, especially
given that there are rockets fired regularly at the special forces
bases in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what happened when U.S. troops carried out their raid here
last Friday night, at least as Kourmashy residents and local
authorities describe the events:</TE>
<TE>   In the scorching summer weather, the evenings are welcome in
Afghanistan. Children, who have whimpered all day in the heat, lie
quietly on their blankets. People stay up late talking and letting
the breezes blow through the open doors and windows.</TE>
<TE>   The moon was almost full and most of the families were asleep when
the thunderous sound of whirring propellers swept over the dirt
pathways and earthen walls of this village about 60 miles south of
Kabul, the capital. Children began to scream; cows and burros pawed
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Several miles away in Gardez, Ahmed Najib Wardak, 39, the acting
governor of Paktia province, was jolted awake. A Northridge resident
for the past 12 years, he returned in April to help his father, then
the governor, rule this turbulent southeastern province where the
Taliban and Al Qaeda were active long after the Taliban regime fell
in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I woke up when I heard the helicopters. I thought [Osama] Bin
Laden was here," Wardak said. "I thought to myself: Why didn't I know
Bin Laden was here?"</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed, he called the special forces soldiers who operate out of
a base just south of Gardez and have established a close relationship
with his government. "I said, 'What's going on?' and they said, 'We
don't know, it's not our operation, but take care of yourself.' "</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile in Kourmashy there was chaos. It is difficult to
determine now exactly what happened, but it seems that at least eight
helicopters came to the village, some of them hovering overhead.
Planes also were flying in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. soldiers hammered on the doors while others clambered
into the houses by climbing over the walls.</TE>
<TE>   The village is little more than a collection of high-walled
compounds made of dried mud. Open sewers run down the middle of the
narrow lanes that separate the homes. Typically, two or three
families live in a compound that has no electricity. Cooking is done
over single-burner gas stoves or open fires. The worn iron pots are
scrubbed clean with sand.</TE>
<TE>   "We were so scared, the helicopter was dropping people down on our
roofs, the children were crying, screaming. It was a very hard
night," said Kompari, 35, who said none of her menfolk were home
during the incident. Like many Afghans, she goes by one name.</TE>
<TE>   Next door, at a compound where Sediqa and Aqela live, soldiers
pushed open the door and rushed into the mud yard.</TE>
<TE>   "There were so many of them we couldn't count them," said Sediqa,
a 35-year-old mother of eight. "The children all woke up. They were
all scared. We have 14 small children in this house and since the
soldiers have come they cannot sleep, they cry and cry."</TE>
<TE>   Sediqa's husband is a wood hauler, while her sister-in-law Aqela's
husband is a butcher. Both men were handcuffed and taken away. The
women said they themselves were moved into a room with the children
while the house was searched, but were not mistreated.</TE>
<TE>   A few houses away, the story at first sounded similar. Bismullah,
15, said his father and uncle, both wood haulers, were handcuffed and
taken away. A fifth man walking on the street was detained as well.</TE>
<TE>   But then the story became less simple. Bismullah said soldiers
seized cases of ammunition, rockets, guns and $4,000--far more
weapons and money than the average wood hauler would have in his
home.</TE>
<TE>   The dollars were from an uncle who worked as a driver in Saudi
Arabia, Bismullah said. He gave no explanation for the weapons. In
Afghanistan, having weapons--even in large numbers--can have many
explanations. The home could have been used by Taliban or Al Qaeda
fighters, but just as likely the arms were the property of one of the
warring factions in the area.</TE>
<TE>   But the village does have a history that links it to the Taliban
and Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. According to Wardak, the acting
governor, the Americans were in search of a man named Alijan, a
longtime driver for the region's former Taliban commander, Jalaluddin
Haqqani.</TE>
<TE>   Haqqani, who had ties with Al Qaeda, is one of the most wanted
Taliban figures. In November, Americans in pursuit of him bombed a
guest house where he was staying, killing some guards and others,
damaging the compound and injuring Haqqani, who managed to slip away.</TE>
<TE>   Alijan, Haqqani's driver of 23 years, was from Kourmashy, and one
of the houses searched belonged to a relative.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military spokesmen would not say whether the soldiers were
seeking Alijan. They only acknowledge that "we had sources of
information that indicated that Al Qaeda or Taliban were in that
location," as Army Col. Rick Thomas, a spokesman for Central Command
in Tampa, Fla., said in a telephone interview. Officials also note
that a cache of weapons was found on the site.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the raid, in terms of American credibility here,
is that Alijan was not in the village and it isn't clear whether
those who were detained had anything to do with Al Qaeda or the
Taliban. No one locally seemed to think that they did. Instead they
believe that the Americans got bad intelligence from Afghans who had
a grudge.</TE>
<TE>   When questioned about Alijan, locals say they have not seen him
since the Taliban fled in the fall. They say they should not be
targeted just because a Taliban member used to visit his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Taliban were in power, they went into every village,
into every mosque, into every house. Who could say no to armed men?
Who could tell him not to come?" asked shopkeeper Mohammed Hassan.
"But we are surprised that these men were arrested--the world has
developed so much, but the American information is so poor that they
would arrest three wood haulers, a butcher and a wood seller."</TE>
<TE>   Wardak and Abdullah, the commander, say they have been told that
the five men probably will be released by the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Roger King, a spokesman at Bagram air base near Kabul, said a
number of Afghans whom the Americans detain are released after
preliminary questioning. When such releases occur, the military
attempts to make amends.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have released people, they get an explanation and a
little something for their trouble; clothing, food--humanitarian
meals that meet cultural norms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Food and clothing aside, it is unlikely that the episode will be
quickly forgotten in Gardez.</TE>
<TE>   "There have never been any Taliban in that village," said Khalid
Ahmed, 22, who repairs radios at a small shop in Gardez. "They
arrested some innocent people, they've taken innocent porters and
packers."</TE>
<TE>   For Wardak, who came to love America during his years in
California, the episode was frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russians did this same kind of thing," he said. "They
disturbed people in their homes; people didn't know what was
happening to them. They arrested them. And if the Americans are not
careful, they will look like the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason I came to work here is to make sure this kind of
thing doesn't happen," he added, "to make sure that the things that
happened with the Russians don't happen with the United States."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Rescuers took advantage of moderate weather Thursday to evacuate 21
Russian scientists trapped deep in antarctic waters and said an
icebreaker on the way should be able to free their ship.</LD>
<LD>   Tanya Hacker of the Cape Town-based Dutch salvage company Smit
Marine said two helicopters had flown from the heated deck of the
South African research ship Agulhas as soon as the wind moderated.</LD>
<LD>   "Both helicopters are back on the ship. They have managed to get
21 people off and to deliver more than 661 pounds of food to the
others still waiting on board," she said.</LD>
<TE>   The German-owned Magdalena Oldendorff was caught in a bay behind
thick ice June 11 and has remained moored to the ice about 550 yards
from the ice shelf with supplies running uncomfortably low for the
107 scientists and crew members who were on board.</TE>
<TE>   Hacker said the two helicopters would try today to make two
flights each, bringing about 40 more men off the ship.</TE>

<HD>Group of 8 Pledges Billions for Africa</HD>
<DH>Summit: World leaders tout continent-backed aid initiative
and call meeting a success. Critics say the program is severely
inadequate.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANANASKIS, Canada</DL>
<LD>Promising billions of dollars for a new African aid initiative and a
Russian nuclear security drive, eight world leaders concluded a
two-day summit in this remote mountain valley Thursday and pronounced
the meeting a resounding success.</LD>
<LD>   "I offered leaders a summit done differently, in a setting that
encourages a positive result, and we delivered," said Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, the host of the gathering.</LD>
<LD>   Four African presidents who joined the Group of 8 leaders echoed
Chretien's enthusiastic assessment. "We are very pleased with the
decisions that have been taken," said South African President Thabo
Mbeki, who was considered the prime mover in the push for increased
aid to Africa.</LD>
<TE>   The Group of 8, which includes Russia and seven major industrial
nations, pledged to provide about $6 billion in additional assistance
for Africa within four years while reducing tariffs on selected
African exports.</TE>
<TE>   Yet critics assailed the aid program as severely inadequate,
noting that most of the money had been pledged months ago and would
be available only to African countries deemed to have met strict
reform requirements.</TE>
<TE>   And while leaders expressed concern in their meetings about the
roiling of stock exchanges by the WorldCom and Enron scandals, there
was no action taken to either calm the markets or encourage stronger
corporate governance rules.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also noted the absence of specific European and Japanese
funding commitments for what a U.S. official termed the "costly and
dangerous enterprise" of dismantling Soviet-era nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons. While the U.S. committed $10 billion to the
project over the next 10 years, the Europeans and Japanese agreed
only to the goal of the eight nations collectively raising as much as
$20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Held amid extraordinary security, at an estimated cost to Canada
of more than $200 million, this year's conclave has prompted critics
and insiders alike to question the expense and utility of the annual
meetings. The Group of 8 comprises the United States, Russia, Canada,
Britain, Japan, France, Germany and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac, the host of next year's summit,
suggested here that the leaders could probably accomplish as much
with long-distance television hookups.</TE>
<TE>   "The time savings you can count on with more systematic use of
videoconferencing, which I've already experimented with, seems
promising," Chirac said, speaking in a live broadcast to the hundreds
of reporters confined to a media center in Calgary about 50 miles
east of the ski resort here where the leaders gathered.</TE>
<TE>   The eight leaders are already committed to yearly face-to-face
meetings through 2006, when Russia--the club's newest member--is
providing the site.</TE>
<TE>   Top aides to President Bush joined Chretien in defending this
year's meeting, calling it more focused and flexible than previous
summits.</TE>
<TE>   They pointed to other achievements of this year's conclave,
including a plan to safeguard container shipping from terrorist
threats. The leaders also called jointly on Pakistan to block the use
of its territory for terrorist attacks in the Indian-ruled portion of
Kashmir, and backed plans for expanded peacekeeping forces in Central
and West Africa.</TE>
<TE>   But the official business of the meeting was overshadowed by
continuing debate over the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased with the response to my proposal," Bush said
Thursday, referring to his speech earlier this week calling for a
change in Palestinian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   However, his implicit call during that address for the ouster of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat drew no strong backing
from fellow summit leaders. The conference's final communique avoided
any direct reference to the Palestinian leadership issue, though it
noted agreement on "the urgency of reform of Palestinian institutions
and its economy, and of free and fair elections."</TE>
<TE>   The official centerpiece of the summit agenda was the African aid
initiative, grounded in the group's endorsement of the New
Partnership for African Development, or NEPAD, a trade-and-aid
initiative designed by Mbeki and other African leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "If Africans really stick to the commitments they have made in
NEPAD to themselves, and to each other, and if the G-8 [members]
really carry out the action plan they are announcing today, this
summit might come to be seen as a turning point in the history of
Africa, and indeed of the world," said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who joined the African leaders here.</TE>
<TE>   At a U.N. conference in Mexico in March, the major industrialized
nations promised to boost annual economic aid to poor countries by
$12 billion over four years--including an unexpected $5 billion
pledge from the United States. Bush said then that he would seek to
raise overall U.S. development assistance from $10 billion now to $15
billion by 2006, though he did not specify how or where the new money
would be spent.</TE>
<TE>   Chretien and most other G-8 leaders wanted to deliver a firm
pledge here that at least half of the $12 billion overall increase
would be directed to Africa. But U.S. and Japanese resistance to such
a clear-cut commitment--in part due to concern about whether African
nations will follow through on the reforms they have
promised--produced notably fuzzier language.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming strong African policy commitments, and given recent
assistance trends, we believe in aggregate that half or more of our
new development assistance could be directed to African nations that
govern justly, invest in their own people, and promote economic
freedom," the eight leaders said Thursday in a joint statement, with
an emphasis on the word "could."</TE>
<TE>   Mbeki and the other African leaders here--the presidents of
Algeria, Nigeria and Senegal--were disguising their disappointment,
some aid experts monitoring the meeting suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "They were putting the best possible gloss on a very disappointing
result," said Ian Gary, an economic development specialist at
Catholic Relief Services, a private U.S. aid agency. "They don't want
to be perceived at home as getting back on the plane empty-handed."</TE>
<TE>   Still, said Condoleezza Rice, the national security advisor to
President Bush, American officials believe that $6 billion or more
will ultimately be directed to sub-Saharan Africa, given the
commitment by many leaders on that continent to enact political and
economic reform.</TE>
<TE>   About 30% of all international development assistance now goes to
sub-Saharan Africa, down from 36% a decade ago, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The new money
could reverse this declining aid trend, experts here said.</TE>
<TE>   Several African nations also will benefit from a new G-8 agreement
to commit $1 billion more to a debt relief plan aimed at the world's
most heavily indebted poor countries.</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair vigorously defended the Group of
8's efforts. "This isn't old-fashioned aid, it is a genuine
partnership for the renewal of Africa," he said. "Today's document
will send out a signal of hope."</TE>
<TE>   The two-day meeting was staged against a spectacular backdrop of
glacier-flecked peaks in the Kananaskis wilderness, a pristine
expanse of game reserves and ski slopes.</TE>
<TE>   The site was chosen by Canada precisely because it is so
remote--only one paved road traverses the area--and so easily
defended from terrorist assaults or protest rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Chretien said after the meeting ended Thursday that mass
demonstrations, as well as the presence of hundreds of aides serving
the leaders, had made past G-8 meetings "a big show," distracting
from the summit agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "Here it was strictly business," he said.</TE>

<HD>Aid Promised for Nuclear Security</HD>
<DH>Russia: G-8 leaders vow to provide as much as $20 billion
to help former Soviet states keep weapons and materials out of
terrorists' hands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>CALGARY, Canada -- The world's leading industrial nations said
Thursday that they would provide as much as $20 billion to help
Russia and other former Soviet states control the poisonous detritus
of the Soviet Union's weapons programs.</LD>
<LD>   Under the 10-year agreement, the United States will contribute $10
billion and Europe, Canada and Japan will contribute a total of up to
$10 billion to secure nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and to
clean up the sites where they were made and stored.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement is intended to keep the weapons, and material that
can be turned into weapons, from terrorists and governments seeking
to develop nuclear devices.</LD>
<TE>   "The attacks of Sept. 11 demonstrated the terrorists are prepared
to use any means to cause terror and inflict appalling casualties on
innocent people," the joint statement by the leaders said.</TE>
<TE>   "We commit ourselves to prevent terrorists, or those that harbor
them, from acquiring or developing nuclear, chemical, radiological
and biological weapons, missiles and related materials, equipment and
technology," they added.</TE>
<TE>   If successful, the accord will give new life to a decade-old U.S.
effort to control one of the still-dangerous legacies of the Cold
War.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is built around both decommissioning nuclear facilities
and weapons and finding work for former Soviet weapons scientists.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin reached
formal agreement on it during a brief private meeting Thursday
morning before the final sessions of the two-day summit of the Group
of 8, which consists of the United States, Russia, Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The accord was one of the major accomplishments at the summit in
Kananaskis, a Rocky Mountain ski village about 50 miles west of
Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said recently that 40% of the
nuclear storage sites in Russia have been given U.S. aid to increase
security and that 20% have received complete security systems.</TE>
<TE>   Although the agreement that was announced Thursday applies to only
former Soviet states, the problem extends well beyond those nations.</TE>
<TE>   Former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) has estimated that about 20 tons of
highly enriched uranium are at 345 civilian research sites in 58
countries, at least some of them only lightly guarded.</TE>
<TE>   The question of how to guard nuclear, biological and chemical
material so it doesn't fall into dangerous hands has been a central
issue in the evolving relationship between Washington and Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Putin and Bush speak often about the improvements they have
achieved in bilateral ties. However, Russia's support for Iran's
civilian nuclear power development has been a sore point. The U.S.
fears that Iran could develop nuclear weapons using the assistance
Moscow is providing.</TE>
<TE>   Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national security advisor, said the
United States was committed to delivering the $10 billion, but she
acknowledged that there was no guarantee the others would come
through with their shares.</TE>
<TE>   However, she said, "We're confident, given the spirit around this
global partnership, that the commitments are going to reach into that
area."</TE>
<TE>   Another senior Bush administration official said the program would
bring Europe and Japan in "a much more major way" into what has been
largely a U.S. effort in nonproliferation, disarmament and
counter-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said each
nation would set up its own projects with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Russians have 40,000 tons of chemical weapons they
must destroy under an international treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the nuclear material would be stored and some would be
converted into fuel for nuclear reactors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But what we're trying to do in the first place is make sure that
this material is under control, that it's not capable of being leaked
out of Russian command and getting to terrorists or to rogue states,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The material comes from a variety of sources, according to the
administration.</TE>
<TE>   The final issue resolved in negotiations dealt with Russia's
acceptance of provisions monitoring how the money is spent and how
the cleanup progresses. Moscow agreed to give the other G-8 members
access to disposal sites and auditing authority.</TE>

<HD>9th Circuit Puts Its Ruling Against Pledge on Hold</HD>
<DH>Courts: Enforcement is blocked until appeals are resolved.
Political howl of protest continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN and JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vowing to fight for the Pledge of Allegiance, U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft, Gov. Gray Davis and leaders of a Northern California school
district declared Thursday that they will ask the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals to overturn its 2-1 ruling that the pledge is
unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Before appeals were even filed, the 9th Circuit judge who wrote
Wednesday's opinion issued an unusual order blocking its enforcement
until petitions for a rehearing are resolved.</LD>
<LD>   Several legal experts described that order as an acknowledgment
that the court is under tremendous public pressure.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, elected officials from President Bush on down
unleashed a second round of denunciations of the ruling, which said
the pledge violated the separation of church and state because it
includes the words "under God."</TE>
<TE>   The court ignored the role of religion in American life, Bush
said, and was "out of step" with American tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a universal God, in my opinion," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the 9th Circuit said the one-paragraph order
Thursday by Judge Alfred T. Goodwin changed nothing, since rulings
are customarily put on hold while appeals are pending. The
spokeswoman said the order was intended only to clarify that 9th
Circuit rulings are not effective immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Several legal analysts said the order indicates that the 9th
Circuit will accept as-yet-unfiled petitions to review its decision,
and several experts predicted that a larger panel of the court will
overturn the ruling before it reaches the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The opinion, written by Goodwin, a Republican appointed by
President Richard M. Nixon, said the Pledge of Allegiance is an
unconstitutional endorsement of religion because of the words "under
God."</TE>
<TE>   The case was brought by a Northern California atheist who was
upset about teacher-led recitations of the pledge in his daughter's
elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft and Davis said they will ask that the three-member
panel's decision be reviewed by an 11-member, en banc panel of the
court. That panel would include Chief Judge Mary M. Schroeder and 10
other judges chosen randomly.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be overturned en banc," said Mark Perry, a
Washington lawyer who previously clerked for the 9th Circuit. "The
9th Circuit has been so often and so forcefully reversed by the
Supreme Court that it will take this opportunity to clean its own
house."</TE>
<TE>   If upheld on appeal, the ruling would prevent public schools
within the nine Western states covered by the 9th Circuit from
leading students in recitations of the pledge unless the words "under
God" were excised.</TE>
<TE>   "The Justice Department will defend the ability of our nation's
children to pledge allegiance to the American flag," Ashcroft said in
Washington. The federal government will "spare no effort," he said,
to ensure that children "can express their patriotism through the
time-honored tradition of voluntarily reciting the pledge."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who had called the court decision ridiculous after it was
issued Wednesday, took time out from an economic summit in Canada to
deride the decision again Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He said it shows the need for "common-sense judges who understand
that our rights were derived from God. And those are the kinds of
judges I intend to put on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, a bill was approved on a 99-0 vote reaffirming
support for both the pledge and "In God We Trust" as the national
motto.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, members from both parties sang "God Bless America,"
then joined to pass a resolution, 416 to 3, protesting the 9th
Circuit ruling. The three no votes, all Democrats, included two from
California: Reps. Pete Stark of Fremont, Michael M. Honda of San Jose
and Robert C. Scott of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Davis said he has directed state Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer to file an appeal and said the opening legal brief would be
sent to the 9th Circuit within days. Davis termed the ruling
wrong-headed.</TE>
<TE>   His Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., questioned the
governor's commitment to the issue, holding a news conference to
charge that Davis had failed to file any legal arguments defending
the pledge tradition in public schools ahead of Wednesday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Davis brushed aside Simon's charge, saying the governor's office
had not been served with a copy of the complaint and was unaware that
the issue was pending before the appellate court.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the case in the past," Davis said, "we intend to
aggressively pursue an appeal."</TE>
<TE>   In the Assembly, members spoke emotionally in favor of the flag
and against the 9th Circuit ruling. The lower house approved a
resolution 69 to 0 urging the U.S. Supreme Court to immediately
overturn the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the Sacramento County school district that was named
as a defendant in the suit said they are considering going straight
to the nation's highest court. "We will fight this as far as it takes
and as long as it takes," said Elk Grove Unified School District
Supt. David W. Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Legal scholars continued to be about the only commentators who did
not flat-out denounce Wednesday's ruling. Many said it was based on a
plausible reading of U.S. Supreme Court precedents, and some law
professors said they believe the panel reached the correct legal
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Even they came under fire Thursday. USC constitutional law
professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who described the decision as legally
correct after it was issued Wednesday, said he has been taken aback
by the vitriol of the hate mail he has received via e-mail since
then.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really nasty," the professor said.</TE>

<HD>Scandal, Economy Force Layoffs at Archdiocese</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The beleaguered Archdiocese of Boston eliminated 15 staff positions
as part of budget cuts made necessary in part by the Roman Catholic
Church's ongoing sex abuse scandal in which it has played a central
role.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese said that the economic downturn and fallout from
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were the driving forces behind its
move to slash its budget by a third, or about $8 million. But it also
acknowledged the scandal concerning pedophile priests--which has
roiled Boston and other archdioceses throughout the country--had
hampered its fund-raising efforts.</LD>
<LD>   Boston Cardinal Bernard Law, the leader of the archdiocese, faces
allegations he knew that several priests were accused of pedophilia
but failed to keep them away from children, instead shuttling them
from parish to parish.</LD>
<TE>   Law's refusal to resign over his handling of the matter has led to
disenchantment among Catholics here, and many stopped giving to his
annual fund-raising drive.</TE>

<HD>Amish Buggy Exemption Pulled From House Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state House, meeting in Harrisburg, deleted from a transportation
bill language that would have allowed an Amish sect to use gray
reflective tape instead of orange triangles on their slow-moving
buggies.</LD>
<LD>   The Swartzentruber sect contends that the triangles--required by
state law--violate their beliefs against gaudy decorations.</LD>
<LD>   The sect is appealing a judge's verdict this month upholding $95
fines issued to 20 sect members for not using the triangles.</LD>
<TE>   Reflective tape on slow-moving vehicles is legal in nine states,
including Ohio, where the sect lived until two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Gary Haluska, who sponsored the amendment deleting the
exemption from the bill, said the triangles are easier for motorists
to see. "It's a safety issue," he said.</TE>

<HD>Gene Cell Therapy Reportedly Corrects 'Bubble Boy' Disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A single injection of genetically modified stem cells is all it took
to cure two children of a complex form of an inherited immune system
disorder often referred to as "bubble boy disease," researchers
report.</LD>
<LD>   An experimental technique that altered genes in bone marrow stem
cells restored the immune systems of the children, researchers from
Italy and Israel said in a study appearing in the journal Science.
The children were born with what experts said was the most complex
form of severe combined immunodeficiency disorder, or SCID.</LD>
<LD>   "Both children have been cured but ... will be closely followed to
see how it develops in the future," said Maria Grazia Roncarolo of
the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy in Milan, Italy.</LD>
<TE>   The children, 7 months and 2 1/2 years old when the therapy began,
were released with healthy, functioning immune systems 15 to 24
months ago, Roncarolo said.</TE>
<TE>   Their form of SCID was caused by a gene flaw that blocks
production of an enzyme called ADA, which is essential to make
disease-fighting immune cells.</TE>
<TE>   Injections of bone marrow stem cells, altered to contain the
missing enzyme gene, were used.</TE>
<TE>   SCID strikes about 50 children a year. In the past, the disorder
was always fatal, with the children usually dying in infancy.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, doctors began treating SCID by isolating patients in
sterile environments. A Houston boy, called "David the bubble boy,"
spent all 12 years of his life in a plastic bubble filled with
filtered air. He died in 1984.</TE>

<HD>Court Backs School's Refusal to Post Religious Symbols</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Columbine High School
administrators acted properly when they refused to hang ceramic tiles
with religious symbols painted by the families of two slain students.</LD>
<LD>   The decision from the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
a lower court ruling, which had ordered school officials to restore
the tiles.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-inch tiles were painted in a project to renovate the school,
where two student gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher on April
20, 1999. The tile project began in 1996 to allow art students to
decorate the school after a renovation.</LD>
<TE>   School officials refused to hang the religious-themed tiles,
saying they violated the Constitution's requirement for separation of
church and state.</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, a conservative group that
defends claims of religious discrimination, sued in 1999 on behalf of
the families who painted the tiles, arguing that their 1st Amendment
rights had been violated.</TE>

<HD>Court Rules Tying Inmates to Pole Is Cruel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Thursday declared unconstitutional an Alabama
prison practice of handcuffing inmates to a metal pole in the summer
heat. The court ruled that an inmate could sue over his chaining.</LD>
<LD>   The punishment, revived in that state in 1995 as part of a
get-tough program for criminals, is "obvious" cruel and unusual
punishment, the court ruled, 6 to 3.</LD>
<LD>   The victory for inmates was partly symbolic. Alabama was the only
state to use "hitching posts" in recent years and it has ended the
punishments.</LD>
<TE>   But the ruling halts a string of Supreme Court decisions that
shielded prison officials from inmate lawsuits. Justices seemed
disgusted with treatment of an inmate who claims he was twice chained
to an outdoor pole in 1995 and denied food and water as punishment
for fighting while on a chain gang.</TE>
<TE>   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, said the
practice "unnecessarily and wantonly inflicted pain."</TE>
<TE>   The practice was reviewed as part of the broader question of when
guards may be sued.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said officers should have known that the treatment was
unconstitutional, and thus can be sued by ex-inmate Larry Hope.</TE>

<HD>House Narrowly Approves Raising Federal Debt Ceiling</HD>
<DH>Spending: Conservative Republicans had been reluctant to
support such a move on the record, but Democrats forced them into a
legislative corner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In an eleventh-hour move to avert a fiscal crunch, the House on
Thursday approved by the narrowest of margins President Bush's
request for an increase in the legal limit on the government's
borrowing authority.</LD>
<LD>   The bill had languished for months while Republicans tried to find
a way to approve the request without having to directly vote in favor
of increasing the debt.</LD>
<LD>   Many conservative Republicans, while usually supportive of Bush,
are loath to be on record as casting such a vote.</LD>
<TE>   The GOP-led House finally approved the measure Thursday night, 215
to 214, in the face of increasingly urgent warnings from Bush and his
lieutenants that the Treasury Department would have to resort to
extraordinary steps to avoid a government default on payment to
bondholders if the debt ceiling were not raised by today.</TE>
<TE>   The debt ceiling needed to be raised to accommodate the growing
federal budget deficit, caused by the economic downturn, the tax cuts
passed last year and the cost of responding to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The House vote sends the bill to the White House for Bush's
expected signature; the Senate approved the measure two weeks ago.
The bill, which authorizes the first debt increase in five years,
would raise the current $5.95-trillion debt ceiling by $450
billion--enough to keep the government solvent until after the
November elections.</TE>
<TE>   House Republican leaders had been reluctant to bring the measure
to a vote. They feared defeat because Democrats were not willing to
vote for a bill that they believed was necessitated largely by the
GOP tax cut they opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans were reluctant to vote for the debt increase
because it runs counter to their fiscally conservative instincts. GOP
leaders hoped to accommodate them by slipping the debt-limit increase
into an emergency spending bill that will soon clear Congress. That
bill, which primarily would fund counter-terrorism programs, enjoys
wide support.</TE>
<TE>   But the GOP leaders backed away from that strategy when it became
clear that Democrats would let them avoid a direct vote on the
debt-limit increase only in exchange for increased spending in the
anti-terrorism bill. GOP leaders told balky Republicans that price
was too high and urged them to support the bill dealing solely with
the debt limit.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's vote, 212 Republicans and three Democrats voted for
the bill. Voting against it were 206 Democrats, six Republicans and
two independents.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats used debate on the measure to press their case that the
increased borrowing is a metaphor for Republican mismanagement of the
budget. The Democrats argued that increasing the debt should not be
approved until Congress reconsiders parts of Bush's tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans responded that Democratic support for spending
increases had as much to do with the debt increase as the tax cut and
that their refusal to support the bill was an irresponsible political
maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like eating a big meal and walking out on the bill," said
Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).</TE>

<HD>Congress Marches to Bush's Tune on Defense Bills</HD>
<DH>Budget: Both chambers approve more money and personnel for
the military. House, Senate clash on funding for antimissile program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House approved $355 billion in defense spending Thursday as
senators also moved to boost a broad range of programs in what would
amount to the largest military funding increase in two decades.</LD>
<LD>   As the House met President Bush's call to make defense spending
its priority, the Senate voted 97 to 2 to authorize an overall
military funding outline of $393.3 billion for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1. The measure would raise military pay 4.1% and fund new
weapons and the next phase of the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican-dominated House and Democrat-controlled Senate
clashed over abortion at overseas military clinics and compromised on
the Crusader cannon and missile defense programs. And the No. 2
Pentagon official threatened to recommend a veto over red tape in the
Senate's proposal for funding a missile defense system.</LD>
<TE>   The House, which passed its version of the defense authorization
bill last month, approved a separate bill Thursday, on a 413-18 vote,
detailing spending. The Senate will not vote on specific
appropriations until it completes work on the overall authorization.</TE>
<TE>   The House spending plan, sponsored by Armed Services Committee
Chairman Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), would fully fund Bush's
$7.6-billion proposal to create a system to defend the nation against
long-range missile attacks. But Democratic leaders in the Senate,
arguing that a foreign missile attack was less likely than a nuclear
or chemical terrorist attack, successfully diverted $878 million from
the program to shipbuilding and other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has threatened to recommend a
presidential veto, saying earlier this week that the proposed cuts
would come in areas that are "so carefully crafted to damage the
entire missile defense program that it has an effect that's vastly
greater than the dollars involved." Senators then sought to avert
that threat with an amendment by Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) that
restored $814 million that was freed by using more optimistic
assumptions about inflation.</TE>
<TE>   But the effort to bridge the gap on missile defense might not
work. On Thursday, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told
the House Armed Services Committee that Pentagon officials would
advise Bush to veto the legislation if "burdensome statutory
restrictions" in the Senate plan remained, including cuts that could
force layoffs of hundreds or thousands of defense workers.</TE>
<TE>   Congress typically alters about 18% of Bush's budget requests,
causing rancor in the administration but keeping the broad outlines
of his policy, said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the
Lexington Institute, an Alexandria, Va., public policy center.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a peculiarity in this process that, although many items are
changed, the defense posture usually ends up looking remarkably
similar to what the administration requested," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Missile defense was by far the most divisive issue in the bill.
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.)
successfully inserted a clause declaring that the Senate's priority
for defense spending is counter-terrorism, not missile defense. The
wording expresses the will of the Senate, but would not prevent Bush
from spending money on missile defense.</TE>
<TE>   An amendment by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) would require the
Pentagon to complete successful tests before deploying a missile
defense program. Amendments by Feinstein and GOP Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska would ban research into nuclear-armed interceptors for missile
defense systems and compel the Pentagon to file classified and public
reports on the systems' testing.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a disturbing trend by the Missile Defense Agency, which
goes well beyond concerns about security, to deny Congress and the
American people basic information on how billions of dollars are
being spent on missile defense," said Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.). "This
amendment requires Congress be kept informed on the performance of
this very expensive system."</TE>
<TE>   As the two chambers hash out missile defense, "there's bound to be
a problem," Lewis said, adding that he expects compromises to result
in a bill Bush will sign.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers carefully crafted wording that would avert a threatened
veto over the Pentagon's plan to kill the program to develop the
Crusader cannon but keep the money and the technology. The 40-ton
self-propelled howitzer, which opponents--including Rumsfeld--say
does not fit the needs of a more mobile military, has strong support
within the Army and in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Senators agreed to transfer $475.6 million in Crusader funding
toward a lighter, more nimble successor cannon and directed the
Pentagon to report how the money is used. The House spending measure
cancels the program but sets aside $648 million for development of a
replacement cannon and instructs the Pentagon to consult with the
current contractor, United Defense Industries.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes advantage of the $2 billion that's already been sunk
into research" on the $11-billion program, Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   One measure sure to prompt a battle as House and Senate conferees
debate the authorization bill is an amendment by Sens. Patty Murray
(D-Wash.) and Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) that would end a ban on
abortion in overseas military hospitals for U.S. servicewomen.</TE>
<TE>   Senators authorized $10 billion in costs related to the war on
terrorism, but the House bill set aside the issue for a later vote.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate also approved a proposal by Sens. Max Cleland (D-Ga.)
and John McCain (R-Ariz.) to hire an additional 12,000 service
members, an increase of 1%.</TE>

<HD>Counter-Terrorism Official Resigns White House Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One of the top counter-terrorism officials in the White House,
retired Gen. Wayne A. Downing, resigned suddenly Thursday, just nine
months after taking the job.</LD>
<LD>   White House officials offered no explanation for the resignation
of Downing, who has also been a leading proponent within the
administration of attacking Iraq with a battle plan similar to that
employed by the U.S. in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Downing, who was a four-star Army general, was brought out of
retirement after the Sept. 11 attacks last year to serve as deputy
national security advisor for combating terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   An administration official said Downing made the decision to leave
in part because his family has been living in Colorado, causing him
to make a difficult commute since taking the job at the White House
in October.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials denied that Downing was frustrated by either
disagreements within the administration about Iraq policy or slow
movement in following through on President Bush's pledge to push for
a regime change in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Before he joined the administration, Downing, working with the
Iraqi National Congress, had devised a military strategy to challenge
the regime of President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional sources said Downing may have become disenchanted
with his job partly because his turf had become crowded with powerful
personalities playing often-overlapping roles in the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Downing's predecessor, Richard Clarke, "was in charge of all
counter-terrorism," said an aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee
who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "Now [Defense Secretary Donald H.] Rumsfeld, Vice President [Dick]
Cheney and President Bush are in charge. Downing's job, relatively
speaking, is less important," the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, the White House said it "valued Gen.
Downing's leadership," and that his work setting up the Office of
Combating Terrorism "will serve our country well into the future."</TE>
<TE>   Downing will be succeeded by retired Air Force Gen. John A.
Gordon, previously undersecretary for nuclear security at the
Department of Energy.</TE>
<TE>   Before his post at the Energy Department, Gordon was deputy
director of intelligence at the CIA. From 1989 to 1993, he served on
the National Security Council staff of the first President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Downing's departure could alter the balance in one of the most
contentious debates within the administration: when and how to launch
a military strike against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Downing was one of the most vocal advocates of a limited
deployment of troops, arguing that the U.S. could topple Hussein by
supporting existing Iraqi opposition groups with a mix of special
units and airstrikes.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Downing was said to be heading an effort to identify
groups that could lead Iraq if Hussein's regime were ousted.</TE>
<TE>   But the so-called Downing plan has faced dug-in opposition from
many uniformed leaders at the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Downing's faith in the capabilities of special forces stems from a
military career in which he ascended from West Point graduate to Army
commando to commander of U.S. Special Operations forces.</TE>

<HD>As Huge Blaze Lies Down, Residents of Town May Get to Go
Home Soon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The lumbering Rodeo-Chediski fire has quieted near here, opening the
possibility that the town's 7,700 residents will be allowed to return
home in a few days, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, only 5% contained, has destroyed at least 423 homes in
nearby mountain communities. The blaze had threatened to blow into
the city since Saturday, and had crept to within half a mile of homes
at the forest's edge. But as the fire stalled under cooler weather,
it burned underbrush and lost its momentum, U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Jim Paxon said.</LD>
<LD>   "Not only has the fire laid down and taken a nap, but Mother
Nature has eaten herself out of house and home," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Residents in some of the stricken areas will be invited to tour
their neighborhoods Monday and view the destruction from school buses
that will not stop. "They will be able to drive by and see their loss
and start dealing with that," Paxon said.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners in some of the ravaged communities already have learned
the fate of their homes by calling the county assessor's office,
which has inspected neighborhoods that were safe to enter.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, a combination of two separate blazes that began June 18
and June 20, continued to grow on most sides Thursday, and some rural
towns remained threatened, but no new evacuations were ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Both fires started on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, one when
a lost hiker set off a flare. The cause of the other is under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters remained on alert Thursday for more fires in the area
because of isolated, dry thunderstorms spiked with lightning.</TE>
<TE>   "The monsoons are setting up," Paxon said, referring to July
rainstorms. "Bring them on, Lord."</TE>
<TE>   He said it would take 2 inches of rainfall to quench the fires.</TE>
<TE>   Similar storms caused havoc Thursday north of Durango. Authorities
were about to allow many of the evacuated residents to return home
but changed their mind when gusty winds threatened to spread flames.</TE>
<TE>   The 70,419-acre fire was 30% contained. That blaze, and a smaller
one that erupted earlier this week, have destroyed 57 homes; 683
families still are out of their homes. The smaller blaze was expected
to be fully contained today.</TE>
<TE>   The Hayman fire southwest of Denver was expected to be contained
today, after burning 137,000 acres and destroying at least 133 homes.</TE>

<HD>FBI, CIA Chiefs Testify on Proposed Agency</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: They tell Senate panel that Homeland Security
Department should not be responsible for U.S. counter-terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's intelligence chiefs testified Thursday that they will
provide personnel and undiluted intelligence to a proposed Homeland
Security Department but argued against giving the new agency
intelligence-gathering powers of its own.</LD>
<LD>   CIA Director George J. Tenet and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller
III stressed that the proposed department should focus its efforts on
finding and fixing the nation's vulnerabilities to terrorism rather
than duplicating their agencies' intelligence-gathering and law
enforcement functions.</LD>
<LD>   Mueller went as far as to suggest that shifting responsibility for
domestic counter-terrorism away from the FBI to the new agency could
hamper America's efforts to prevent another attack.</LD>
<TE>   Stripping the FBI of its counter-terrorism responsibility "would
not be a wise idea," he said. "Such a move at this critical moment
would disrupt our ongoing battle against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   But their testimony to a Senate panel--their first on the subject
since President Bush unveiled his proposal to create a Department of
Homeland Security--was accompanied by indications from influential
lawmakers that the CIA and FBI might have to relinquish significant
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) said he is concerned that the FBI
is stretched too thin. "The FBI has too many priorities. I don't see
how the bureau can do all of them and do them well."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), vice chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said Sept. 11 was proof that no official in
government has adequate authority to gather information on terrorist
threats against the U.S. and respond to them.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 10 months later, he said, "no one really knows what we
know, and no one is really in position to go and find out. This state
of affairs is deplorable and must end."</TE>
<TE>   Shelby's comments came during a key day of hearings before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, a panel that will play a
significant role in shaping legislation to create a Homeland Security
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called earlier this month for the creation of a Cabinet-level
agency that would encompass the Coast Guard, Customs Service,
Immigration and Naturalization Service and other agencies. It would
have almost 170,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $37
billion.</TE>
<TE>   No one has so far formally proposed including the CIA and FBI in
the new department. But there has been considerable discussion on
Capitol Hill about how to make sure the CIA and FBI cooperate with
the department and whether they should even yield some of their
traditional turf to it.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the committee,
said the new department "must have the authority to task the
intelligence and law enforcement agencies to collect information"
rather than merely having access to what they produce.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet and Mueller both replied that they routinely collect
information at the behest of other government officials, but they
stopped short of endorsing the idea of giving a new homeland security
chief authority over their agents and officers.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, which is responsible for domestic intelligence gathering
and counter-terrorism, has come under particular scrutiny since
revelations in recent months that it mishandled warnings that might
have enabled authorities to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Several times Thursday, Mueller was asked whether it was possible
for the FBI to handle the competing demands of pursuing criminal
cases, which requires the guarding of evidence, and combating
terrorism, which entails sharing information quickly and widely.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller responded by saying that FBI field agents are, more than
anything, "good collectors of information" and that splitting them
into separate law enforcement and counter-terrorism entities would
only hinder information sharing.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that 2,000 of the bureau's 11,500 agents are now focused
almost exclusively on counter-terrorism, acknowledging that
post-Sept. 11 priorities have required a shift in resources from
other areas of law enforcement, particularly drug interdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet and the CIA have also come under criticism for Sept. 11
failings. Shelby, a longtime critic of Tenet, said Thursday that the
CIA director has "openly defied" efforts at meaningful reform. He
questioned Tenet's commitment to providing the Homeland Security
Department access to raw intelligence data as well as analytical
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet had testified earlier in the day that the CIA would be
willing to furnish raw data to the department but would seek to
protect the names of sources and methods by which they were
collected.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said his committee is scheduled to begin working on the
homeland security bill in mid-July.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, efforts to strengthen and reshape the FBI for the fight
against terrorism provoked a public spat between the Justice
Department and a leading Republican, a sign of rising tensions
between the administration and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) abruptly canceled a
hearing on the issue just minutes before Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft was
scheduled to testify. Sensenbrenner, a stickler for protocol, said he
acted "because the Justice Department failed to provide Atty. Gen.
Ashcroft's testimony to the committee."</TE>
<TE>   People testifying before Congress are required to give advance
copies of their written testimony, but the rule is often ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Aides said Ashcroft, who has incensed some members of Congress for
keeping them out of the loop on key anti-terrorism decisions, was
befuddled by the gesture. Several suggested that Sensenbrenner's real
motivation was to be on the floor of the House for discussion of a
bill on the Pledge of Allegiance rather than having to listen to
Ashcroft.</TE>

<HD>Justices Lift Free-Speech Limits on Judicial Candidates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Candidates who are seeking election as judges have a
free-speech right to take stands on issues they may someday have to
rule on, the Supreme Court said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Judges need to be open-minded, but they need not be empty-headed,
said Justice Antonin Scalia, speaking for the 5-4 majority.</LD>
<LD>   ''It is virtually impossible to find a judge who does not have
preconceptions about the law,'' Scalia said. And it is ''at the core
of our 1st Amendment freedoms'' that candidates are free to tell the
public about their views, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling strikes down the judicial codes in at least nine states
that say prospective judges may not ''announce'' their views on
issues that might come before the court.</TE>
<TE>   It also undercuts similar rules in the other 30 states that elect
judges, including California, that say judicial candidates must not
''commit'' themselves to particular views.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Wersal, an outspoken opponent of abortion who ran
unsuccessfully for a Supreme Court seat in Minnesota, challenged the
no-comment rules, and Minnesota Republicans took up his cause.</TE>
<TE>   The free-speech decision in Republican Party of Minnesota vs.
Minnesota Board of Judicial Standards, 01-521, also comes at a time
when judicial elections are being transformed by big-money
advertising. Two years ago, business interests spent millions of
dollars in TV advertising in an unsuccessful effort to unseat liberal
judges in Ohio, Michigan, Alabama and Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial groups have decried this trend, but they have no means to
stop it.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenters and the leaders of the American Bar Assn. called
Thursday's ruling a serious mistake and said it threatens to
transform judicial elections into political free-for-alls. Judges are
supposed to be impartial and above the fray, not politicians in robes
who represent certain views.</TE>
<TE>   ''Judges speak in the name of the law. [They] do not act on behalf
of particular persons, communities or parties,'' Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg said in a dissent she read after Scalia had finished.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the case split the appointed and presumably apolitical
justices on ideological lines. Scalia was joined by his fellow
conservatives: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ginsburg was joined in her dissent by her liberal
colleagues: Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Stephen
G. Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   In his opinion, Scalia stressed that states choose to elect their
judges.</TE>
<TE>   They need not do so, but once they have made this choice, they
cannot muffle candidates from speaking their minds, he said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from
communicating relevant information to voters during an election,'' he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, beginning in 1924, the ABA encouraged states to adopt
codes that limited what judicial candidates could say. The rule in
Minnesota said a candidate for a judgeship shall not ''announce his
or her views on disputed legal or political issues.''</TE>
<TE>   This prohibition ''extends to the candidate's mere statement of
his current position, even if he does not bind himself to maintain
it'' if elected, Scalia said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers such as Wersal who violated the code were subjected to a
variety of punishments, including a suspension from practicing law or
even disbarment.</TE>
<TE>   California has a more lenient standard. It says, ''A candidate for
election or appointment to judicial office shall not make statements
... that commit or appear to commit the candidate with respect to
cases, controversies or issues that could come before the court.''</TE>
<TE>   Charles Lindner, the former president of the Los Angeles County
Bar Assn., said it is common for judicial candidates to campaign by
criticizing incumbent judges.</TE>
<TE>   ''They tend to say the incumbent is soft on crime or something of
that sort,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   But judges who are on the bench usually have to be more restrained
in defending themselves, Lindner added.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court justices in California are appointed by
the governor, but they must face the voters in a retention election.</TE>
<TE>   Though these are usually low-key affairs, Chief Justice Rose Bird
and two colleagues were ousted during the 1980s in a campaign that
focused on the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   During the oral argument in the Minnesota case, the state lawyer
stressed the danger of overly politicized judgeships.</TE>
<TE>   No one would want to come before a judge who has announced he will
convict and impose the maximum sentence on anyone charged with a
particular offense, whether it be drunk driving or wife beating, he
said. These stands may be popular with the voters, but such
unyielding stands conflict with the judge's need to be impartial, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Scalia noted that this case dealt only with controversial
statements, not ''pledges or promises'' to rule a certain way.
Minnesota also bars judges from making such pledges, but that rule
was not challenged, he said.</TE>

<HD>It's a 1-Man Show at Show Low's Kmart</HD>
<DH>Fire: The store manager stayed when the town evacuated.

<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>When the nation's largest wildfire forced the evacuation of this
mountain town Saturday evening, Rob Morones hurriedly sent his
employees away--but he remained behind to single-handedly serve
customers around the clock at his Kmart.</LD>
<LD>   As smoke cloaks the city, Morones works, eats and sleeps beside
his cash register, selling snacks, underwear, toiletries, even
pillows to thousands of firefighters and law enforcement officers who
have taken over the city.</LD>
<LD>   He closes for a few hours after midnight to catch an hour or so of
sleep on a tan Martha Stewart chaise lounge next to the customer
service desk. But firefighters who come by the store in the middle of
the night know they can ring the bell and Morones will let them in.</LD>
<TE>   Morones, 37, hasn't seen his wife of 13 years or their 3
1/2-year-old son since the weekend--they, too, fled the town. Rather
than return home for his own necessities, Morones shopped at
Kmart--and paid for his items.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't like to explain why he has kept his store open because
"it's too corny."</TE>
<TE>   "I have to keep it open for these guys. I know how I'd feel if I
needed something," he said. "And now I've made a lot of friends."</TE>
<TE>   A firefighter from Flagstaff who frequents the store said Morones
is mentioned at briefings as if he's part of the team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely wonderful, the support this gentleman has given
us," said Don Howard, who stopped by again Thursday for some
binoculars and windshield cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   The line of firefighters wearing their banana yellow
fire-retardant shirts--intermixed with police and other emergency
personnel--can wind 200 people long during peak hours, the
twice-a-day shift changes. It gets crowded again at 2 a.m. when the
National Guard crews change.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more sought-after items: flashlights, suntan lotion,
towels, board games and sports balls. A firefighter Thursday was
returning a malfunctioning CD player; Morones cheerfully gave him his
refund.</TE>
<TE>   "A whole bunch of guys the other day all bought squirt guns,"
Morones said. "I said, 'Please tell me you're not using those to put
out the fire.' "</TE>
<TE>   For days, Morones didn't know the fate of his own home on the west
side of town, which was threatened by the fire. When he shared his
anxiety with some police officers, they drove over to check on the
place and returned with good news.</TE>
<TE>   Some grateful customers give Morones the shirts off their backs.
Above the cash register, 31 shirts hang, emblazoned with the logos of
fire and police departments from San Bernardino to Montana to New
York. There's also a National Guard camouflage jacket. The store's
snack bar is closed--Morones can't do it all--but he has befriended
Maricopa County sheriff's deputies who came here from Phoenix to
help, and now they bring him three meals a day.</TE>
<TE>   "They're my good friends," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Morones also is making friends at Kmart headquarters in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the mark of an everyday hero," said President Julian Day,
who recently took over the company after the Kmart chain filed for
bankruptcy protection. "Rob is a very humble guy, who really doesn't
ask a whole lot of you when you talk to him. He doesn't realize we're
blown away by the example he's setting for everyone in the company,
and for helping the community."</TE>
<TE>   The calls were nice, Morones said, because he is a big supporter
of the company's new management. "But we all put our pants on one leg
at a time. I respect him as a person and for his position, but what
really means a lot to me is when firefighters shake my hand."</TE>
<TE>   His supervisors say they worry for Morones' health--and are amazed
by his productivity. Morones is leading the district for the number
of items that pass through his cash register per minute--21.6, said
Ernie Caringola, a Kmart district manager. During down time, Morones
stocks the shelves with goods sent here in anticipation of a run on
merchandise as the fire approached.</TE>
<TE>   The 78,000-square-foot store, stocked with $16 million in
merchandise, normally is staffed by more than 35 people. Finally, on
Thursday morning, Morones relented and allowed one of his clerks to
join him for the day because the threat to Show Low had lessened.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us wanted to come back to help Rick," said Carol Deacon, a
10-year veteran of the store. "But he only allowed one of us back."</TE>
<TE>   Morones, who moved here four years ago from Tucson, said he
doesn't want to put anyone else at risk. He has embraced Show Low as
his new home and became the store manager 1 1/2 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I like small communities," he said. "You see the same people all
the time, and they're people you can count on."</TE>
<TE>   His calmness is contagious as restless firefighters grow quiet and
patient in lines that sometimes bring three-hour waits.</TE>
<TE>   As he finishes each transaction, Morones asks the customer his
name, and shakes his hand.</TE>

<HD>In New York, It's Outrage Followed by 'Consider the Source'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"What are they smoking out there?"</LD>
<LD>   As he unloaded heavy crates of soft drinks on a steamy Thursday
morning, New York truck driver John Corcoran wasn't inclined to chat.
But he was happy to blast the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals'
ruling that the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance were
unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   "This is typical for San Francisco, isn't it?" he added, wiping
sweat from his face. "These people live in their own little world."</LD>
<TE>   As Americans pondered the court's decision--with the great
majority in apparent opposition--some seemed equally concerned that
the panel had gone against the national grain at a time when the
United States is at war.</TE>
<TE>   Then they considered the source: The traditionally liberal court
is just across the bay from Marin County, home of John Walker Lindh,
the American who fought for the Taliban. The area is also home to
Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), the only member of Congress who opposed
a resolution authorizing President Bush to use military force after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It's the place where Berkeley officials ordered firefighters to
remove large American flags from their fire trucks after the attacks,
fearing they might incite violent antiwar protests. And now it's the
home of a court opinion that has many rolling their eyes in
disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   As the furor grew, Judge Alfred T. Goodwin stayed the three-judge
panel's decision on Thursday afternoon, pending a review by the full,
11-member Court of Appeals. The ruling, if upheld, would prevent
public school students in nine Western states from reciting the
pledge as now written.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, some legal experts said the panel's original ruling
was based on sound constitutional principles and not so farfetched,
despite the huge public controversy it has generated. Yet the image
of a loopy ruling from a liberal West Coast court quickly took hold
in the national media.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's a San Francisco earthquake when you really need one?"
cracked the New York Post in a lead editorial titled "Left Coast
Lunacy." Even the New York Times, which editorialized that the
circuit court decision was "well-meaning," dismissed the bombshell
ruling, saying it "trivializes" serious constitutional debates about
the separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   As she waited to hail a cab near Macy's department store,
freelance artist Angie Massa said she found the court decision
repellent but the Bay Area "amusing."</TE>
<TE>   "We've been saying [the pledge] all our lives, and suddenly some
guy out there is worried about his daughter being exposed to
something," she said. "I mean, don't you think all this is a little
precious?"</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation, television and radio talk shows boiled over
with angry opinions on the decision. Several all-news cable TV
networks compiled viewer polls throughout the day, all finding a
majority opposed to the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   There were numerous shots of schoolchildren reciting the pledge
Thursday, plus interviews with students who said they had no problem
with "under God." Grass-roots supporters of the ruling were in short
supply.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why the bulk of public opinion seemed to oppose the
ruling, MSNBC commentator Jeff Cohen said it was "an emotional
reaction" that ignored strict constitutional principles, adding that
"I don't think these judges have gone too far at all." In response,
National Review editor Rich Lowry said Cohen and the Bay Area judges
were "out of step with America."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling offered fodder for late-night comedy, from "The Tonight
Show With Jay Leno" to "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart." Wednesday
night, Leno said that he was going to open the show with the Pledge
of Allegiance, "but I don't want to go to jail."</TE>
<TE>   ''If the ruling stands, [the words 'under God'] will be stricken,
leaving a hole, or, as some in our cash-strapped government see it, a
lucrative sponsorship opportunity,'' Stewart joked Thursday on his
show, which mocks news coverage of the day's headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Discussion of the ruling was quickly seized upon by talk-radio
hosts, some of whom joined in lampooning California. KABC host Al
Rantel, a conservative, called the ruling "shameful" but not
surprising coming from "the People's Republic of San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, some callers to talk-radio shows said the Bay Area
court's decision was long overdue, while others called it a foolhardy
ruling that illustrated the "tyranny of the minority over the
majority."</TE>
<TE>   During a Fox News Channel interview, Michael A. Newdow, the
Sacramento father who filed the lawsuit challenging the use of the
Pledge of Allegiance in a local school district, declared: "I would
hope that I am one of the most admired persons in America, for
standing up for the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   But that was a hard sell in Manhattan. As he bought lottery
tickets at a midtown newsstand, steamfitter Tim Sullivan laughed at
the whole controversy and said Newdow was "an idiot--just a crazy guy
from the Bay Area."</TE>

<HD>Despite Obstacles, GOP Prescription Drug Bill Passes</HD>
<DH>Benefits: House Democrats say the measure falls short of
guaranteeing coverage to senior citizens. Some Republicans criticize
creating an entitlement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Republican-controlled House early today approved long-awaited
legislation to help senior citizens meet the soaring costs of
prescription drugs--a pressing concern that has become an important
issue in this year's midterm elections.</LD>
<LD>   The bill was passed, on a 221-208 vote. Despite broad support for
the idea of providing new drug subsidies, the GOP measure faced a
surprisingly tough fight. It was bitterly opposed by Democrats, who
said it did not go far enough to guarantee coverage. Some
Republicans, meanwhile, warned that the bill would go too far in
establishing a costly government entitlement.</LD>
<LD>   GOP leaders had vowed to pass the bill before Congress adjourned
for its weeklong Fourth of July recess. They worked into the night
Thursday, twisting arms and cutting deals to win support from
recalcitrant Republicans.</LD>
<TE>   Their victory came in the early morning hours today, when 212
Republicans were joined by eight Democrats and one independent in
supporting the bill. Only eight Republicans defected and opposed the
bill, joining 199 Democrats and one independent.</TE>
<TE>   Attention now shifts to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where
leaders plan debate on a more generous version of the drug benefit
bill next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We need action, not words, because America's greatest generation
cannot wait any longer for help on their prescription drug bills,"
said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   If it were to become law, the bill would mark the biggest
expansion of federal health subsidies for senior citizens since
Medicare was created in 1965. The Senate is scheduled to take up its
version of the legislation next month. But lawmakers say prospects
for enactment are slim because of the vast differences between the
parties over how to provide the new drug benefit--and the heavy
political pressures against compromise in this election year.</TE>
<TE>   Just as they did when Medicare was established, Democrats favor
providing guaranteed benefits through the federal government, while
Republicans want to offer subsidies through the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   The political stakes are significant: Democrats have made a
campaign issue out of their support for a more generous prescription
drug benefit under the Medicare program. Republicans worry that
unless they pass some version of their own, they will be vulnerable
to charges of neglecting the most significant concern of senior
citizens, who vote in large numbers and wield disproportionate
political clout in off-year elections. "The battle for a drug benefit
is an incredibly important subcomponent of Republican success in this
cycle," said GOP pollster Bill McInturff.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is already woven deeply into the fabric of House and
Senate campaigns around the country. Some Democratic candidates in
Northern states have highlighted the issue by staging bus trips to
Canada, where prescription medication is less expensive. The issue is
dominating the Senate race in Maine, where GOP Sen. Susan Collins is
being challenged by Chellie Pingree, a state legislator who sponsored
a state prescription drug program.</TE>
<TE>   "Make no mistake, there is one thing standing between senior
citizens and affordable prescription drugs: Republican control of the
House of Representatives," said Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have worked hard to neutralize the issue by blurring
differences between the parties. For the Memorial Day recess, the
House leadership sent lawmakers home armed with briefing papers,
PowerPoint presentations and instructions to hold town meetings on
the GOP plan. Drug companies, which support the GOP approach, have
financed television ads praising House Republicans who are running
for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of medicine has emerged in recent years as a major issue
because prices have gone through the roof.</TE>
<TE>   According to Families USA, an organization favoring a drug
benefit, the average annual cost of prescriptions for seniors more
than doubled between 1992 and 2000, from $558 to $1,211.</TE>
<TE>   Prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare, the federal health
insurance program for senior citizens and the disabled, in part
because they were not as big a part of health care in 1965 as they
are now--especially in the treatment of chronic diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP bill would cost $350 billion over 10 years, including
about $310 billion for drug coverage. The rest of the money would go
to raise payments to hospitals, health maintenance organizations,
doctors and others who care for Medicare patients.</TE>
<TE>   Under the GOP plan, the new drug benefit would be provided not
through Medicare, but through subsidies to private insurers that
offer benefits. Beneficiaries would pay premiums of $33 a month and
have a deductible of $250 a year--although those fees would be paid
by the government for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The program would cover 80% of drug expenses from $250 to $1,000
and 50% up to $2,000. Then there would be a gap in coverage that has
been heavily criticized by Democrats: Beneficiaries would have to pay
all of their expenses until their total costs hit $3,700.</TE>
<TE>   After that "stop-loss" level, the government would pick up the
whole bill.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats say the Republican plan, by leaving much to the
initiative of private insurers, does not do enough to guarantee that
affordable benefits would be available.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans hope that by passing this bill, they can make the
voters feel better about them in November," said House Minority Whip
Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). "But the reality is, this bill does
not add a benefit that seniors can count on."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats support a more expensive alternative, costing more than
$800 billion over 10 years. It would have a $25 monthly premium, a
$100 deductible and a $2,000 stop-loss level.</TE>
<TE>   Because Democrats were virtually unanimous in their opposition to
the GOP bill, Republican leaders had to keep their own members
solidly behind the measure.</TE>
<TE>   With Republicans' margin of control in the House a mere 11 votes,
a handful of GOP defections could kill the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Hastert and his lieutenants have worked for days behind the
scenes, trying to assuage factions of Republicans who threatened to
revolt.</TE>
<TE>   Among the concerns:</TE>
<TE>   * Some conservatives objected to the bill's price tag and to the
idea of creating an entitlement. Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.) called for
a less expensive alternative that would target aid to the needy,
rather than create a "universal entitlement," regardless of need.</TE>
<TE>   * Some Republicans argued that the bill should include provisions
designed to curb the price of prescription drugs. GOP Reps. Gil
Gutknecht of Wisconsin and Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri sought
amendments to make it easier for pharmacies and individuals to import
cheaper prescription drugs from outside the U.S. and to close a
loophole in patent law that can be used to slow less expensive
generic drugs from coming to market.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a bidding war among Republicans, with competing
demands that were difficult for GOP leaders to reconcile.</TE>
<TE>   It reflected a split in the party between members who wanted to
take care of home-state interests and those who recoiled at the
already big increase in spending. "It's hard to pass because
everybody wants things in it," said Rep. Thomas M. Reynolds (R-N.Y.).</TE>

<HD>Plan for New SAT Wins Approval of College Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Trustees of the College Board voted unanimously Thursday to develop a
new SAT, adding a writing test, beefing up the math section and
making other major changes in the college admission exam.</LD>
<LD>   The new test, to be given for the first time in March 2005, will
include questions based on advanced algebra, not just algebra and
geometry as it does now. It will replace verbal analogies with
additional reading comprehension questions. And, most significantly,
it will require each student to produce a handwritten essay as part
of the new writing exam.</LD>
<LD>   College Board President Gaston Caperton said the revamped SAT will
improve on the existing test by ''placing the highest possible
emphasis on the most important college success skills--reading and
mathematics, and now, writing.'' He also said it will be more closely
aligned with high school curriculum and state educational standards.</LD>
<TE>   The SAT was taken last year by 1.3 million high school students,
many of whom took it more than once in an effort to improve their
scores, College Board officials said. The new test will cost students
$10 to $12 more than the current one, which is priced at $26 this
fall. It will also grow in length, from three hours to 3 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   And it will include a new feature that will give students and
schools feedback after testing on ways to improve performance.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to overhaul the SAT, a test that has assumed a
larger-than-life role for students seeking entrance to the most
competitive universities, was made in a meeting here of the College
Board, a 31-member panel that includes college administrators, school
superintendents and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The move was propelled in part by the University of California,
the biggest client of the SAT, which had threatened to scrap the exam
in favor of a test more closely linked with high school coursework.
In a highly publicized speech last year, UC President Richard C.
Atkinson publicly questioned the value of the test and said it was
unfair to many students.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Atkinson said he was delighted with the College
Board's decision and said plans for the new test appeared to meet the
university's demands for change.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, he said, the new test, with its emphasis on writing
and on strengthened math skills, could have a ''transforming'' effect
on schools across the country.</TE>
<TE>   ''Early in their career, all students will understand the
importance of writing,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caperton, a former governor of West Virginia who has led the
nonprofit College Board for three years, acknowledged the role of the
University of California in the changes announced Thursday. Given the
prominence of the university and its 170,000 students, Caperton said,
''if we didn't listen to them, we'd have to be both arrogant and
stupid.''</TE>
<TE>   Caperton announced in March that the College Board was considering
changes in the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   But Bruce Walker, the director of admissions at the University of
Texas and a College Board trustee, said it took the trustees some
time to get used to the idea of overhauling the test, which was last
revised, less significantly, in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped students, parents and teachers would accept the
changes and understand that they would connect the test more closely
to high school coursework.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, makers of the rival ACT admission exam, taken by almost
1.1 million students last year, say their exam already tests what
students learn in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The SAT, the older of the two tests, has long been used by many of
the nation's most elite universities and holds a strong advantage
among schools on the East and West coasts.</TE>
<TE>   The ACT is predominantly used in the states in the middle of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   ''We believe that it's ironic that the [SAT] appears to be making
changes that reflect what we have done for over 40 years,'' said
Cynthia Schmeiser, vice president of the Iowa-based testing company.</TE>
<TE>   Like the SAT, however, the ACT has not had an essay component.
Earlier this year, it said it would develop an essay question for
California college applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, critics of the SAT and other standardized tests said
the changes announced Thursday will do little to address what they
called the SAT's fundamental flaws, including persistent racial gaps
in scores.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of a timed essay, in fact, will make the SAT even
tougher for students who are not native speakers of English, said Bob
Schaeffer, an official with the National Center for Fair &amp; Open
Testing, an anti-testing organization.</TE>
<TE>   And overall, he said, the changes will continue to benefit
upper-income students whose parents can afford to pay for test
preparation services, not the lower-income or underprivileged
students who may need them the most.</TE>
<TE>   College Board officials blame the stubborn racial and, to some
extent, gender gaps in SAT scores on the nation's unequal educational
system and say the test itself is not to blame.</TE>
<TE>   ''The SAT is a very fair test,'' Caperton said.</TE>

<HD>Educators Say Drug Testing Will Stay Rare</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Few school districts conduct such programs. The
go-ahead from the Supreme Court may not change that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO and JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thursday's Supreme Court decision permitting the drug testing of all
students who sign up for extracurricular activities will protect the
prerogatives of school boards while having little practical effect in
U.S. school districts, say education officials across the country.</LD>
<LD>   A 1995 Supreme Court decision upheld drug testing of
student-athletes. This one clearly allowed such testing of all
extracurricular participants, from band members to academic
decathletes.</LD>
<LD>   But only a tiny percentage of school districts nationwide--surveys
put the number at 5% or less--perform testing of either group. Most
have eschewed the tests, saying random testing of students is costly,
ineffective or invasive of privacy.</LD>
<TE>   With a national consensus against random drug testing of students,
supporters and opponents of Thursday's high court ruling--affirming a
testing policy in a rural Oklahoma school district--agreed that it
would hardly disrupt the lives of American students. Some principals
and education officials point to surveys suggesting that students
active in extracurricular activities are less likely to use drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "As a practical matter, the decision makes no good sense," said
Hal Kwalwasser, general counsel for Los Angeles Unified School
District, which does not conduct random testing. "I think very few
schools will find great utility in merely testing those in
extracurricular activities.... I can't imagine the utility of testing
members of the chess club."</TE>
<TE>   The true power of the 5-4 decision, written by Justice Clarence
Thomas, lies in reaffirming that American students are, legally
speaking, second-class citizens--a popular view in superintendents'
suites.</TE>
<TE>   The decision carved out an exception to the 4th Amendment, which
prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, for students regardless
of whether they do anything to create suspicion of drug use. In the
same way, corporal punishment of students remains constitutional,
though state legislatures and school boards typically ban it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very important decision because it means school boards and
communities get to make the policy in these areas," says Edwin
Darden, a senior staff attorney for the National School Boards Assn.,
which filed an amicus brief in support of the Oklahoma district's
testing policy. "Tests are costly to operate and they take time to
administer, but this preserves that option for local communities."</TE>
<TE>   Darden was not alone in praising the ruling but declining to
endorse student drug testing. "It has proven to be useful in some
schools," said Bush administration drug czar John Walters, "but
that's not going to be the case in many districts."</TE>
<TE>   Even Graham Boyd, director of the drug policy litigation project
at the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the students
who unsuccessfully challenged the Oklahoma district, said losing the
case would not lead to significantly more testing in schools.</TE>
<TE>   While criticizing the decision for "reducing student privacy
rights to that no better than prisoners," Boyd said he expected
testing to remain "quite rare, not really for legal reasons but
common sense reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Some American schools began limited drug testing of some students
in the 1980s. Banning High in Wilmington famously started a random
program for athletes after cocaine overdoses by two football players
in 1986 but quickly dropped it. After the Supreme Court declared
testing of athletes constitutional in 1995, hundreds of schools
nationwide started programs of their own.</TE>
<TE>   The concept never caught on in big cities. A spokeswoman for the
Los Angeles County Office of Education said she was unaware of any
county school district that tested students randomly. Three years
ago, Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the nation's fourth-largest
district, started a pilot testing program but soon dropped it, citing
a lack of money.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say most existing testing programs are targeted to
suspected users or are voluntary. Drug testing is more common in
Catholic and other private schools, at high school sports powerhouses
where boosters pay for the testing of athletes, and in rural
communities worried about the influx of big-city drug culture. In
court, the most important cases on school drug testing have come from
challenges to testing regimes in small towns in Oregon, Indiana,
Colorado and, now, Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to encourage rather than discourage" extracurricular
participants, said Chicago Board of Education general counsel Marilyn
Johnson, expressing the prevailing big-city sentiment. "They do
better in school and stay in school that way."</TE>
<TE>   Some superintendents and principals were bracing Thursday for
renewed sales pitches from companies that market low-cost drug
testing kits. One such firm, Lifepoint Inc. of Ontario, had
incorporated the Supreme Court decision into its marketing by
Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   But the nine justices of the high court, whether they support
testing or not, were careful not to endorse such testing.</TE>
<TE>   Concurring with the majority in upholding drug testing, Justice
Stephen G. Breyer was hardly enthusiastic. "I cannot know whether the
school's drug testing program will work," he wrote. "But in my view,
the Constitution does not prohibit the effort."</TE>
<TE>   In a sarcastic dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--noting that
the school band, the Future Farmers of America and Future Homemakers
of America could be tested under the upheld policy--mocked fears of
"out-of-control flatware, livestock run amok, and colliding tubas."</TE>

<HD>Downwind of Wildfires, There's a Breath of Risk</HD>
<DH>Smoke: For people with asthma, emphysema, chronic
bronchitis or heart disease, the thick haze can bring fear,
discomfort, even death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC and ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life has been bad for Blenda Baty since Colorado's wildfires began.</LD>
<LD>   A severe and chronic asthma sufferer, the 46-year-old Denver
resident first noticed smoke June 9, a day when it hung thick over
the city. She fought for breath on the short walk home from church.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt like my lungs were going to burst," she said. "It was
really, really rough--it was scary."</LD>
<TE>   Since then she has been holed up in her home, venturing out only
when she must. Before the Hayman fire, she could walk a few blocks
without labored breathing. Now she wheezes just moving from one room
to the next. She's taking more medications to help her breathe,
including one that her doctors had weaned her from because it weakens
her bones.</TE>
<TE>   "They're scared to take me off because they want me to breathe,
but they're scared to leave me on because of the osteoporosis," Baty
said.</TE>
<TE>   For people like Baty, smoke from the wildfires raging across
Colorado and Arizona has brought a new kind of discomfort and fear.
Smoke and ash might seem merely a nuisance to most people, causing at
most itching eyes, coughing, sore throats and nosebleeds.</TE>
<TE>   But the fallout from a fire can be a serious health hazard to
people with asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis or heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Others who are particularly sensitive to smoke include children
and infants, the elderly, people with allergies, pregnant women and
virtually anyone who leads a vigorous outdoor life.</TE>
<TE>   Health Alerts Go Out</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, state health departments in Arizona and New Mexico
have issued health advisories to several communities downwind of
several fires, including Winslow and Holbrook, Ariz., and Albuquerque
and Santa Fe, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   About 90% of the pollutants in smoke are microscopic particles,
including tar, soot and chemicals. They are so tiny that they easily
glide down the throat and lodge deep in the lungs, clogging airways
and triggering allergic reactions. Other particles form when
superheated gases driven from trees and shrubs condense in the
atmosphere and fall to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   With big wildfires scorching the West, new medical studies show
that the smoke contains a host of potent lung irritants.</TE>
<TE>   Major wildfires in 2000 produced 19 million tons of carbon
monoxide nationwide, nearly one-fifth the amount emitted by
smokestacks and tailpipes that year, and 3 million tons of tiny
particles, according to the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   "Smoke from forest fires has a lot of respiratory irritants and
toxic chemicals in it. It's a witch's brew of all kinds of things,"
said Dr. Michael Lipsett of the California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "Smoke is more complicated than you believe," said Tom Cahill,
atmospheric scientist at UC Davis. A lot of what looks like smoke,
Cahill said, are pyrolytic gases and vapors driven off plants that
aren't fully combusted.</TE>
<TE>   Other chemicals are present too, including formaldehyde, acids and
a class of cancer-causing compounds called polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons.</TE>
<TE>   There has been one death attributed to smoke pollution. Ann Dow,
50, of Teller County, Colo., died of a smoke-induced asthma attack
shortly after the Hayman fire broke out. She collapsed after telling
her husband she couldn't breathe and was pronounced dead at a
Colorado Springs hospital.</TE>
<TE>   At Kaiser Permanente, which serves 400,000 patients in Colorado,
calls from people suffering from asthma attacks and emphysema tripled
about the time Dow died, said Dr. Gray Houlton, who manages a call
center where patients report problems and get advice.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, about 15 people with severe respiratory problems have
been given oxygen treatments at Winslow Memorial Hospital, according
to hospital spokeswoman Anita Warboys. The White Mountain Medical
Center in Springerville, 50 miles from the evacuated town of Show
Low, also has treated patients for asthma attacks and other
respiratory problems, as well as for heart problems like angina that
could be related to the smoke, hospital spokeswoman Linda Martin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Studies done in other states show a pattern of respiratory injury
during wildfires. In Florida, emergency room visits for asthma and
bronchitis doubled, while reports of chest pains jumped 37% from
previous years in one fire-ravaged county, according to a study by
Florida health officials. About half a million acres were charred in
the summer of 1998 in some of the worst fires in the state's history.</TE>
<TE>   During an October 1999 forest fire in Northern California, smoke
blowing down canyons to the Hoopa Indian Reservation north of Eureka
reached concentrations 45% above the level deemed hazardous. While no
one died of smoke inhalation, emergency room visits for respiratory
problems jumped 52%, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes environmental conditions minimize the danger. Many
wildfires burn in sparsely populated areas, and heat often floats
smoke thousands of feet into the sky, away from towns. Winds that
inundate towns with smoke can shift suddenly, limiting the duration
of exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a transient exposure and it's hard to measure. One day it's
significant, the next day the winds change," said Joshua A. Mott, a
CDC epidemiologist. "The longer smoke stays toward ground, you have
higher readings, and that's when you tend to see respiratory
effects."</TE>
<TE>   Avoidance Is Best Bet</TE>
<TE>   Prudent avoidance is key to keeping safe during a fire, said
Michael Volz, a Denver physician specializing in allergic and
respiratory conditions and spokesman for the local American Lung
Assn. chapter. He said people with asthma and other chronic lung
problems play it safe by avoiding smoke and limiting activity as much
as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Experts urge people at risk to consider other protective measures,
such as keeping a five-day supply of groceries and medication on
hand, avoiding stove-top cooking to reduce indoor air pollution,
weather-sealing to keep out pollutants; running an air conditioner on
recycled air mode, using a large high-efficiency particulate air
filter and designating one room a "clean air" shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Don't, however, rely on paper masks, because "they don't filter
out the small particles and won't take care of gases," Lipsett said.</TE>
<TE>   Baty has heeded health advisories and continues to restrict her
activities, even as the smoke subsides.</TE>
<TE>   "Mentally and physically, it's been bad," Baty said. "I am
concerned about people who have lost their houses and when is it
going to stop.... I worry about other people, like my mom, who also
has asthma. And then I'm concerned about myself."</TE>

<HD>Cocaine Use Up Among Teens in Survey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>More teenagers are using cocaine and regularly smoking and drinking,
but an increasing number are also wearing seat belts and refusing to
ride with a driver who's been drinking, according to a survey
released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The annual survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in schools across the country, examined the behavior
of 13,600 high school students.</LD>
<LD>   The survey found injury and violence-related behaviors have
fallen, but kids still regularly smoke and drink--nearly half said
they had consumed more than one alcoholic beverage more than once in
the month before the survey.</LD>
<TE>   The number of teenagers who said they had tried cocaine in their
lifetime rose to 9.4%, up from 5.9% in 1991. About 4.2% of students
said they had used cocaine in the last 30 days, up from 1.7% in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have plenty of work to do," said Laura Kann, a
researcher in the CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion.</TE>
<TE>   About 46% of teenagers said they'd had sex, down from 54% in the
1991 survey. The percentage of sexually active teenagers who had used
a condom increased from 46% to 58% from 1991 to 1999, but then
remained there through 2001.</TE>
<TE>   That points to a failure of "abstinence-only" sex education
programs favored by the White House, said James Wagoner, president of
Advocates for Youth, a nonprofit group that supports both abstinence
and birth-control education for teens.</TE>
<TE>   "The implication is clear, and yet the current administration
ignores it. If you give young people information about how to protect
themselves, they use it," Wagoner said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   A separate survey of youths' risky behaviors by the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center found that a third of
900 teens queried said they had either smoked cigarettes or
marijuana, drunk alcohol or gambled for money within the last 30
days.</TE>
<TE>   Results from the nationwide telephone survey of youths ages 14 to
22 were to be released Friday by the center's Institute for
Adolescent Risk Communications. The survey had a margin of error of
3.3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Other findings from the CDC survey:</TE>
<TE>   * The number of teenagers who said they never or rarely wore a
seat belt fell from 25.9% to 14.1%.</TE>
<TE>   * The number of teens who said they rode with a driver who'd been
drinking fell from 39.9% to 30.7%.</TE>
<TE>   * The percentage of teens in a daily physical education class fell
from 41.6% in 1991 to 32.2% a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   * The percentage of students who carried a weapon decreased from
26.1% in 1991 to 17.4% in 2001.</TE>

<HD>House Panel Charges Convicted Colleague</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Ohio's James A. Traficant Jr. was guilty of
corruption. He may be expelled from Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The House ethics committee issued a 10-count list of
alleged violations Thursday against convicted Rep. James A. Traficant
Jr. and set a public hearing for next month.</LD>
<LD>   The charges allege that the Ohio Democrat engaged in a "continuing
pattern and practice of official misconduct," including acceptance of
kickbacks, encouraging the destruction of evidence, defrauding the
United States and filing false income tax returns.</LD>
<LD>   The eight-member panel, which includes two fellow Ohio lawmakers,
said it would hold a public hearing on July 15 to determine whether
any of the charges "have been proven by clear and convincing
evidence."</LD>
<TE>   Traficant has called repeatedly for a public hearing, during which
he has said he will present the ethics committee with taped
conversations that were barred from his bribery trial by a federal
judge.</TE>
<TE>   He claimed the audiotapes prove that witnesses against him were
bullied into testifying by the federal government. The judge ruled
that since the people Traficant taped were available to testify in
person, there was no reason to play the taped conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's spokesman, Charles Straub, said Thursday, "It's quite
clear that the ethics committee has relied quite heavily on the trial
transcripts and it's now up to them to decide what the next step is."</TE>
<TE>   Issuing charges against Traficant moved the ethics committee
closer to recommending a punishment, which could include expulsion
from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Expulsion is the most severe punishment and has happened to only
one congressman in the last 141 years. Such action would require the
approval of two-thirds of the 435-member House.</TE>
<TE>   As part of an unusual, informal agreement, Traficant has not
appeared on the House floor since his conviction on bribery and
racketeering charges in April. In exchange, critics have refrained
from seeking his immediate expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's alleged violations of ethics rules are based on
the testimony and evidence at Traficant's trial in Cleveland, and
members of an investigative subcommittee noted they decided not to
open a time-consuming investigation into other potential violations
of House rules.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, serving his ninth term from the northeast Ohio district
around Youngstown, faces up to 63 years in prison at a court
sentencing set for July 30.</TE>
<TE>   A judge this week rejected Traficant's request for a new trial.</TE>

<HD>Next Barrier to Vouchers Is Selling Idea to the Public</HD>
<DH>Education: Court offers momentum, but it has to be shown
that the concept is the answer to the school problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN and MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court decision Thursday allowing public funds to pay
tuition at private religious schools removes the legal cloud that has
hung over such controversial programs, but not the political one.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides in the debate over vouchers predict that the ruling
will fuel a long-range push for them and other forms of school choice
around the country. However, even ardent fans of vouchers concede
that the decision does little to quickly boost the stock of similar
proposals among state legislators or the chances that such plans will
soon spread widely.</LD>
<LD>   Many Americans need to be persuaded that vouchers are the answer
to their complaints about public education. And public school
teachers, through their unions, will be a powerful voice arguing
against replicating the Cleveland experiment that was upheld by the
court, experts say.</LD>
<TE>   Stanford University political scientist Terry M. Moe, the author
of a book about Americans' attitudes toward schools and vouchers,
said voters know little about the issue so they are susceptible to
arguments from teacher unions that making vouchers widely available
would harm the public schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simply a matter of power, and it has very little to do with
public support or the need for poor kids [to have] more options," Moe
said, so while the decision may inspire voucher proponents in many
states and cities, they will face "a long, slow, hard process."</TE>
<TE>   The seven-year-old Cleveland program provides vouchers of up to
$2,250 for about 4,500 students, mainly from low-income families.
Ninety-nine percent use them to attend religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest voucher program is in Milwaukee, where about
11,000 students receive vouchers worth about $5,500 for private
schools, secular or parochial. Florida has two similar voucher
programs: One is for students who attend schools the state has judged
to be failing, and one is for about 350,000 students who have been
diagnosed with learning or physical disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Some states, including Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota
and Pennsylvania, give taxpayers a credit or a deduction to offset
the cost of private school tuition.</TE>
<TE>   Bills to provide vouchers for students have been introduced in 27
states in recent years, but all have been defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Leah Vukmir, a pro-voucher activist who is running for the
Wisconsin Legislature, said the court decision makes vouchers more
mainstream and removes any hint of illegitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It will create an atmosphere where people will be less worried
about it, absolutely," she said. "The Supreme Court's decision
confirms what those involved in the movement have known all along,
that giving parents options doesn't violate the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Allen, president of the pro-school choice Center for
Education Reform, a Washington advocacy group, was delighted with
Thursday's ruling. "It's a great day," she said. The fight now moves
to the state legislatures, she said, and the prospects there for
victory remain uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Voucher opponents, whom she derisively referred to as "the
education blob," will continue to fight just as hard as her side, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Chase, the president of the National Education Assn., agreed
that the nation's largest teacher union will rally against voucher
proposals wherever they surface.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's amazing about this is that people say this is
school reform, and it just makes absolutely no sense to me," he said.
Rather than fleeing public schools, the majority of parents want
improvements such as "having a quality teacher in every classroom,
small class size, resources, high expectations and parental
involvement."</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the court released its decision, Rep. Dick Armey
(R-Texas), the House majority leader, proposed a voucher program for
disadvantaged children living in Washington, D.C. Depending on their
family's income, students could qualify for federally funded
scholarships worth up to $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the battle may be joined as early as next week.
That's when state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) expects to introduce
legislation to give all parents, regardless of income, about $3,800
per child to pay for tuition wherever they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of the end of the educational monopoly,"
said Haynes. "Will it happen this year? Maybe not. But right now
their strongest argument ... is now gone, and they can no longer
cloak themselves in Mom, apple pie and the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   A similar California voucher measure met defeat in November 2000,
when it was rejected by 71% of the voters. That was an expensive
battle in which each side spent more than $30 million. In 1993,
California voters rejected a proposal along the same lines.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo), who is the state
superintendent-elect, said any attempt to revive the issue in
California will fail, regardless of the court's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no support for vouchers in the Legislature, nor is there
support among the citizens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the political prospects for vouchers remain debatable, so
do the academic benefits of such programs. Stanford University
education professor Martin Carnoy said new data show that privately
funded voucher programs in Washington, D.C.; Dayton, Ohio; and New
York provide little benefit for most students.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, expanding such programs could actually dilute any
positive effect because parochial schools could be overwhelmed with
students who are seriously behind academically, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Cleveland, studies of their effect show that students with
vouchers make about the same academic progress as those who remain in
public schools.</TE>
<TE>   "The Supreme Court is back on the first test: The voucher program
is constitutional. But the jury's still out on the second test: how
well this program raises the academic performance of our students,"
Ohio Supt. of Public Instruction Susan Tave Zelman said in a
statement issued Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   However, Cleveland parents receiving vouchers are adamant in
defending the program's value.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Anthony, whose granddaughter Erica Cruz has used a voucher
for six years to attend a parochial school, said she hopes all
Americans can get such aid.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, oh, yes, that's the best thing since sliced bread that's
ever happened in this world," she said. "It's just great."</TE>
<TE>   She said "there's some wonderful, dedicated teachers in the public
schools, but it's just like they're fighting a boxing match with both
hands tied behind their backs."</TE>
<TE>   The political struggles facing vouchers have caused many
school-choice advocates throughout the country to favor tax credits
for private education instead. Tax breaks are given to parents and,
more commonly, to corporations and individuals willing to contribute
to scholarship charities. Those entangle states less directly in
tuition transactions than do vouchers.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who promoted vouchers in his state,
said he expects tax credits to be a quicker route to promoting school
choice than publicly funded vouchers. Boehner said he and other
congressmen expect soon to introduce a proposal for a national tax
credit, an idea supported by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us believe that by empowering parents we get more choice,
and I truly believe it's not only good for low-income parents, it's
good for the education system as a whole," he said. "I come from the
private sector where I dealt with competition every day, and
competition makes us strong."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1.25 million low-income parents nationwide requested
scholarships from the privately funded Children's Scholarship Fund
four years ago. But only 40,000 could be awarded.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Maria Dyer uses the fund's scholarships to send
her two teenage sons to Catholic schools.</TE>
<TE>   Private schools are not necessarily academically stronger than
public schools, she said, but they tend to instill values and keep
children safe.</TE>
<TE>   However, Dyer, a single mother who works at a Venice bakery,
opposes putting public money toward private schools. Doing so "is
just to let go of a system that you have already, without trying to
work it out first."</TE>

<CX>   Superintendent of public instruction--An article in Friday's Section
A about the national prospects for school vouchers incorrectly

<HD>Global Health Panel Expresses Concerns on Fried Food Risks</HD>
<DH>Cancer: The levels of the chemical acrylamide found in
foods by a Swedish team 'constitute a serious problem,' WHO chairman
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A panel of health experts hastily convened by the World Health
Organization said Thursday that they have "major" concerns that a
chemical caused by cooking starchy foods such as French fries and
potato chips at high temperature could pose a cancer risk to humans.</LD>
<LD>   The panel, which met in Geneva after the release of a Swedish
government study identifying the suspected human carcinogen in a
variety of foods, said it was disturbed by the high levels of
acrylamide in many of the 200 food products tested.</LD>
<LD>   "After reviewing all the available data, we have concluded that
the new findings constitute a serious problem," said Dr. Dieter
Arnold, chairman of the WHO meeting.</LD>
<TE>   The panel noted that, while the substance is known to cause cancer
in animals, little is known about its effect on humans. Therefore, it
did not issue warnings to consumers against eating certain foods,
urging instead a balanced and varied diet, rich in fruits and
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   More research is needed, the group said, to establish whether the
agent causes cancer in humans and to pinpoint how it is formed during
cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Acrylamide is used to treat water, make plastic packaging and is a
component of cigarette smoke.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which sent representatives
to the meeting, said in a statement Thursday that it will widen the
range of foods it is testing for acrylamide and will do additional
research to gauge its effect on human health.</TE>
<TE>   Many U.S. scientists said there is no immediate cause for alarm.
Much of the foods we eat every day contain some level of animal
carcinogens and pose no threat to humans, said Dr. Elizabeth Whelan,
president of the American Council on Science and Health.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking, which accounts for a third of all cancer cases, is a much
bigger risk, she said, as would be a diet deficient in fruits and
vegetables. "It's a puzzle to us, why [acrylamide] is being singled
out." Whelan said.</TE>
<TE>   However, analysts say there are some differences between the
acrylamide stir and other food scares of the past, such as those
involving the apple growth-regulator Alar and the artificial
sweetener saccharine.</TE>
<TE>   The levels of acrylamide detected in food are significantly higher
than the dose shown to cause tumors in rats. One test of McDonald's
French fries found levels of acrylamide 300 times more than the
amount allowed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a glass
of water.</TE>
<TE>   "The bigger exposure estimates makes acrylamide look like it needs
further research," said Lois Swirsky Gold, who directs the cancer
potency project at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The Swedish findings, released in April, initially were dismissed
by some public health experts who questioned the study's methodology
and its limited scope; the study tested only 100 food products.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, further research in Britain and Norway has backed up
the Swedish study's results and more products have been analyzed.
Recent tests by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a U.S.
consumer group, found similarly high levels in a dozen products it
tested, including cereals, taco shells, potato chips and French
fries.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a lot that still isn't known about the chemical. The
amount of acrylamide in products varies widely, even among similar
foods. Fritos brand corn chips, for instance, contained more than
three times the amount of acrylamide as Tostitos, according to the
center's study.</TE>
<TE>   United Nations officials said they intend to create a global
network to share research on acrylamide with different government
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly we need more research in this area," said Jorgen
Schlundt, head of the WHO food safety program.</TE>

<HD>Mariners Get Boost From Martinez, 7-4</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edgar Martinez, back in Seattle's starting lineup for the first time
since April 11, homered and drove in three runs to lead the Mariners
over the Oakland Athletics, 7-4, Thursday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The popular designated hitter got a standing ovation from the
crowd of 42,159 in the first inning and hit his first home run of the
season against Barry Zito in the third. Martinez had a two-run single
in his first start since rupturing a tendon behind his left knee in
Seattle's 10th game of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The 39-year-old slugger had surgery April 13 to remove the
ruptured tendon, and was activated from the disabled list June 14.</LD>
<TE>   The Mariners used him as a pinch-hitter on their recent road trip
to National League cities, but he tore scar tissue in his left leg
last Thursday in Cincinnati and had not played since.</TE>
<TE>   Defeating the A's for the third night in a row, the Mariners ended
Zito's personal nine-game winning streak and handed him his first
loss since April 30.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Baltimore 2--Jason Giambi homered twice and drove in
three runs as the Yankees averted a sweep at Baltimore by ending the
Orioles' four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   David Wells (8-5) gave up six hits over 6 2/3 innings for the
Yankees, who lost the first two games of the series. Wells, 1-4 in
his previous five starts, gave up two runs--one earned--struck out
five and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Minnesota 4--Ray Durham hit a three-run homer, Paul
Konerko went four for five with a home run and the White Sox won at
Minneapolis to gain a split of the four-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Torii Hunter had two hits and drove in a run for Minnesota, which
leads Chicago in the AL Central by six games. They play 15 more times
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 5, Detroit 2--Mike Sweeney homered for the third day
in a row, leading the Royals to a three-game sweep at Kansas City,
Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney, who took over the AL batting lead from Seattle's Ichiro
Suzuki by going three for four Wednesday night, walked twice and
wound up one for two to raise his average to .365.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 6, Toronto 4--Steve Cox hit a tiebreaking, two-run
double in the seventh inning and the Devil Rays won at St.
Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland at Boston, ppd.--The Indians and Red Sox were rained and
no makeup date has been set.</TE>

<HD>Victory Gives Angels an Even Demeanor</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>It began just up the freeway with a victory over the Dodgers at
Dodger Stadium. It ended in the heat of Texas Thursday night with
another victory, 6-3, over the Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   In between, there were clutch hits and crushing blows, new faces
like rookie pitcher John Lackey and new places like Milwaukee's
Miller Park.</LD>
<LD>   And after 14 games in 13 days through four states, merciless
summer heat, stifling humidity and ferocious thunderstorms, the
Angels finished their longest trip of the season 7-7.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a tough road trip," Angel outfielder Tim Salmon said. "We
are glad to be getting out of the heat and the humidity. It drains
you."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had just enough in reserve to pull out Thursday's
victory at The Ballpark in Arlington in front of 22,077. They won
behind the pitching of Jarrod Washburn, Scot Shields and Troy
Percival and another balanced performance by a lineup that pounded
out 11 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn had much to be pleased about. He won his eighth decision
in a row after starting the season 0-2 and improved his record in
June to 12-1.</TE>
<TE>   But ever the perfectionist, Washburn chose to focus on another set
of numbers, 105 pitches in six innings. In his last outing, against
the Milwaukee Brewers, he threw 122 pitches in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   "One hundred pitches in six innings is not cutting it," Washburn
said. "That's asking a lot of the bullpen, to leave them with that
many innings. I've got to find myself a way to get deeper in the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn allowed a home run by Ivan Rodriguez and four hits while
striking out six and walking two.</TE>
<TE>   For Rodriguez, it was only his third home run of the season, but
his second in as many days and his third in his last eight games.
Before hitting his first homer Friday, Rodriguez had gone 101 at-bats
over two seasons without hitting the seats.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn left with a 4-1 lead. The Angels got three runs in the
fifth, two coming home on a Salmon single and the other on an Adam
Kennedy single, all off starter Rob Bell (3-3).</TE>
<TE>   They got a gift run in the sixth when right fielder Juan Gonzalez
lost Brad Fullmer's fly ball in the sky. It bounced in front of him
for a double. Fullmer scored on a single by Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   But Angel Manager Mike Scioscia has learned not to relax on this
trip because of the inability of his pitching staff to avoid damaging
control problems. In the previous four games against Texas, the
Angels had walked 20 men in 33 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, in the eighth, reliever Ben Weber slipped into the
frustrating pattern. He walked two men and gave up a single to
Gonzalez to load the bases. With one out, Weber hit Kevin Mench in
the hand to send home a run.</TE>
<TE>   On came reliever Dennis Cook to walk in another run.</TE>
<TE>   On came Shields to pitch to Ranger outfielder Ryan Ludwick.
Shields knew one thing. He wasn't going to give Ludwick a fastball.
He remembered clearly the fastball Ludwick had hammered for a home
run when the two faced each other in a triple-A game earlier this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I remembered," Shields said, "and I wanted redemption."</TE>
<TE>   He got it with a slider. Ludwick grounded the pitch to Kennedy,
who started an inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels pulled away with two more runs in the ninth. One came
home on a double by Darin Erstad. Salmon's grounder to short was
responsible for the second run. Shortstop Alex Rodriguez threw home
trying to get the runner, David Eckstein, but his throw was wide
right, leaving Eckstein out of reach of the other Rodriguez, Ivan,
the catcher.</TE>
<TE>   Enter closer Troy Percival in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Exit the Rangers, 1-2-3.</TE>
<TE>   While Washburn, who equaled a career high with his eighth
consecutive victory, wasn't pleased with a split of the long trip, he
saw the bright side.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not playing good baseball," he said. "When you are not
playing good baseball and you come out of it at .500, it was not a
total waste."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost two of three to the Dodgers, two of three to the
St. Louis Cardinals, swept three from the Brewers and won two of five
from the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Not a total waste, but totally exhausting.</TE>

<HD>Scioscia to Be All-Star Coach</HD>

<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Mike Scioscia, in his third season as Angel manager, has been given
his first All-Star coaching assignment. Joe Torre, the New York
Yankee manager who will manage the American League in the All-Star
game at Milwaukee's Miller Park on July 9, has selected Scioscia and
Cleveland Indian Manager Charlie Manuel as his coaches.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great honor," Scioscia said Thursday. "I'm excited to be
part of the atmosphere and that game. It's always fun."</LD>
<LD>   Scioscia was twice a member of the National League squad in his
days as a Dodger catcher. In 1990, he was the starting catcher at
Chicago's Wrigley Field, subbing for the injured Benito Santiago.
That made him the first Dodger All-Star starter at that position
since Roy Campanella 36 seasons earlier.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As he headed out for the pregame warmup, right-hander Ramon Ortiz
held up his glove and asked with a smile, "Do you think they'll let
me use it today?"</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz hadn't been smiling Wednesday when umpire Mike Reilly told
him just before the first pitch that Ortiz couldn't use the glove
because it is a two-tone model, a rule violation.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz hurled the glove across the third-base line in apparent
anger. But Scioscia later said Ortiz was merely confused because he
hadn't understood the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An All-Star party will be held at Edison Field on the night of the
game to benefit Team UP for Down Syndrome, an organization founded by
former player and current broadcaster Rex Hudler and his wife,
Jennifer. Details: (714) 338-7383.</TE>

<HD>Avengers Rally for Victory</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Los Angeles clinches .500 season with a big
second half against Toronto in a 58-44 road victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Ingram scored two second-half touchdowns, including one on a
last-minute interception return, to help the Avengers to a 58-44
victory over Toronto on Thursday night in front of 7,024 at Air
Canada Centre.</LD>
<LD>   The Avengers erased a 10-point third-quarter deficit to improve to
7-4, which is the third-best record in the Arena Football League. The
top four teams get a bye in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "Things worked out well for us in the second half after we made
some adjustments," Avenger receiver Greg Hopkins told KMPC 1540.</LD>
<TE>   "We stopped making mistakes and played well as a team."</TE>
<TE>   After former USC and Santa Monica High quarterback Pat O'Hara
completed a touchdown pass to Terry Brown to give Toronto a 34-24
lead in the third quarter, Los Angeles rallied behind a touchdown
catch by Hopkins and a fumble recovery for a score by Chris
Butterfield, giving L.A. a 37-34 lead.</TE>
<TE>   After the Phantoms tied the score, 37-37, the Avengers took the
lead for good when Tony Graziani passed to Ingram for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto (5-6) misplayed the ensuing kickoff and Hopkins recovered
the ball in the end zone, giving the Avengers a 51-37 lead.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hara rallied the Phantoms within 51-44 and had them in position
to tie the score at 51-51 before Ingram's interception and 50-yard
return for the touchdown with 55 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a few key plays but [Ingram's] interception sealed the
win," said Los Angeles Coach Ed Hodgkiss, whose team has won three
games in a row and clinched the franchise's first .500 season.</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers play two of their final three regular-season games at
home. They play host to Arizona on July 6, play at Indiana on July 14
and end the season at home against Buffalo.</TE>

<HD>Corey Used Drug Before Collapse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Met pitcher Mark Corey admitted he smoked marijuana shortly
before he had a seizure and collapsed on a street near Shea Stadium
after a game Wednesday night, according to a newspaper report.</LD>
<LD>   The New York reliever said he was to meet today with Met
psychiatrist Allan Lans, coordinator of the Employee Assistance
Program, Corey told Newsday in a story posted on its Web site.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess I'll have to deal with those things starting tomorrow,"
Corey said.</LD>
<TE>   Corey said doctors told him he'd been affected by an "anxiety
attack."</TE>
<TE>   Corey underwent tests Thursday to determine what caused the
seizure. Met General Manager Steve Phillips refused to discuss any
drug-related topics regarding Corey.</TE>
<TE>   Corey was taken to New York Medical Center after he was stricken
about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday. He was released early Thursday and put on
the 15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mets alerted baseball officials this week that the elbow pad
that Atlanta Brave outfielder Gary Sheffield had been wearing is
longer than the 10-inch maximum.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets notified the commissioner's office, and a representative
from disciplinarian Bob Watson's office came to Shea Stadium on
Wednesday and measured a pad that fit the specifications.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, the Met GM, noticed during the game that Sheffield was
still using an extra-long pad and said he pointed it out on video to
Watson's assistant, Matt McKendry, after Sheffield's tiebreaking
grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   McKendry then remeasured the pad at 14 inches. The Braves will
likely be fined because of the infraction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Cardinals will recall rookie right-hander Travis
Smith before this weekend to take the place of Darryl Kile, who died
last Saturday. Smith was already in uniform on Thursday and Manager
Tony La Russa said, "I know he's pitching Saturday." But the team had
not made the move official.</TE>

<LD>Jonathan Young's fight against Julio Gonzalez of Huntington Beach
still is two days away, but he has already faced a preliminary
challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Young, traveling from Las Vegas to Anaheim for Thursday's news
conference at the Arrowhead Pond, was stranded on Interstate 15 in
the Cajon Pass for nearly two hours while fire raged out of control
late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning.</LD>
<LD>   "It was crazy," a tired-looking Young said of the fire that
temporarily shut down the main route between Los Angeles and Las
Vegas for nearly 12 hours. "I'm just glad I'm here and now I'm just
looking forward to beating Julio Gonzalez."</LD>
<TE>   Gonzalez (29-1, 19 knockouts) will fight Young (10-4-2, 5) in a
light-heavyweight bout, the main event of a five-bout card Saturday
night at the Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "Jonathan's speed might create some problems," said Gonzalez, who
trains at La Habra Gym, along with Anaheim heavyweight Javier Mora
(13-0-1, 12), who will fight former NFL player Leroy Humphries
(3-3-1, 1) of Austin, Texas</TE>
<TE>   "It should be an interesting fight and I see it going the
distance," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   Dagoberto Najera of Bell (15-3, 5) will fight Kelson Pinto of
Brazil, who has won all 11 of his pro fights by knockout, in a
super-lightweight bout. Najera had been scheduled to fight Larry
Mosley of Culver City, but Mosley pulled out Wednesday because of
flu.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the card, Robert Ortiz of Simi Valley will fight Jose Luis
Torres of Canoga Park in a featherweight bout, and Tracy Stevens of
Canada will box Maria Duron of Anaheim in a mini-flyweight bout.</TE>

<LD>A new sport called Slamball makes its debut Aug. 3 on TNN. "It's
pretty wild," said former Philadelphia 76er President Pat Croce, a
minority owner in the project, in an interview with the Philadelphia
Daily News.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the first extreme team sport. It's four-on-four basketball
on a spring-loaded court. Inside the three-point arc are
trampolines."</LD>
<LD>   "We got the players from inner-city L.A. and Chicago. They wear
skateboard gear and helmets, and there are no fouls. These guys are
flying in the air above the rim."</LD>
<TE>   As Steve Martin would say, they're just a bunch of wild and crazy
guys.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which major league team holds the record for most
victories in a season?</TE>
<TE>   Goodbye, Jeff: Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News says it's
time for the Giants to trade Jeff Kent, who had a recent dugout
skirmish with Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything about Bonds rubs Kent the wrong way--posing after
launching home runs, his failure to run out some pop flies and
groundouts, the arm guard he's allowed to wear while batting and
above-the-team schedule he's allowed to keep.</TE>
<TE>   "But some of Kent's contempt is fueled by jealousy. He can't seem
to accept the fact that he isn't half the hitter Bonds is--that
Bonds' menacing presence made possible Kent's MVP award [in 2000]."</TE>
<TE>   Confident: John McClain of the Houston Chronicle writes that
Oregon quarterback Joey Harrington, the Detroit Lions' No. 1 pick,
was impressive on and off the field in his first mini-camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in a situation where every pass, every [step of]
footwork, everything you do is analyzed," Harrington said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready for it. Plus that kind of makes it fun, puts more
pressure on it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got the eyes of an entire city watching your every
move, that's what it's all about."</TE>
<TE>   Home away from home: Philadelphia Eagle tight end Chad Lewis
recently completed his NFL-sponsored 10-day trip to Asia. Lewis, who
is fluent in Chinese, was a popular interview with the media in
China.</TE>
<TE>   "When they found out I'd do interviews in Chinese, the interview
requests tripled," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   Simple guy: After winning a watch as National League player of the
week, Pirate outfielder Craig Wilson told the Beaver County (Pa.)
Times, "It's a nice honor and it will be nice to get a watch. But I
never wear a watch. I just look out the window and see if it's
daytime or nighttime."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, life isn't complicated for Craig.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1939, the New York Yankees launched a
doubleheader record 13 home runs out of Shibe Park in a 23-2 and 10-0
sweep of the Philadelphia Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The 1906 Chicago Cubs and 2001 Seattle Mariners,
116.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Will Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak ever be
surpassed?</TE>
<TE>   Pete Rose, who holds the modern National League record of 44
games, told the Miami Herald:</TE>
<TE>   "The record is not the hardest record in the world to break. You
need luck, but the pitching is so watered down today and you've got
guys who can run, so I don't see why not."</TE>
<TE>   OK, Pete, then why has the record lasted for 61 years?</TE>

<LD>The Clippers made a trade late Wednesday evening, but it wasn't the
move they hoped would bring a standout point guard to Staples Center.
Instead, the team sent center Mario Kasun, their second-round draft
pick, to the Orlando Magic for future considerations.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the Clippers are expected to announce they have signed
Marko Jaric, a 6-foot-7 point guard who has been playing in Italy
since he was selected 30th overall in the 2000 NBA draft.</LD>
<LD>   So what's next?</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Elgin Baylor refused to speculate Thursday. In
fact, he did not speak to the Cavaliers about continuing trade talks
for Cleveland point guard Andre Miller. Talks broke down during the
draft and there's now no sense of urgency.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to update today," said Joe Safety, Clipper vice
president of communications. "We're making arrangements to bring our
draft picks out here early next week."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers drafted Maryland's Chris Wilcox with the No. 8 pick
and Fresno State's Melvin Ely at No. 12. Deals for Miller and New
Orleans point guard Baron Davis could not be completed during the
draft.</TE>

<DH>Brazil's Scolari, Germany's Voeller master art of coaching</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Two extraordinary transformations have occurred at the World Cup,
both involving the coaches who will be on the sideline for Sunday's
final in the gray concrete fortress that is this port city's
International Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Luiz Felipe Scolari, the sergeant major with the clipped mustache
who rules Brazil's team with a sharp tongue and an iron hand, has
changed into a coach willing to allow his players the freedom to
create and to play the "jogo bonito" he once ridiculed.</LD>
<LD>   Against all odds, the "beautiful game" has flowered again under
Scolari's care.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, over in Germany's camp, Rudi Voeller, the curly-haired
maestro in the rumpled brown suit who was the scourge of opposing
defenders in his days as a world-class and World Cup-winning striker,
has become someone who sees defense, not offense, as the way to bring
the Cup back to Germany four years before it hosts the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Against all odds, the player who scored 47 goals in 90 games for
Germany is getting increasingly adept at devising tactics that
prevent goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very good goalkeeper [Oliver Kahn] and we are very good
at set pieces," Voeller explained. "It's no shame to win games that
way."</TE>
<TE>   They are very different men, these two coaches, but they covet the
same goal.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari wants to lead Brazil to its fifth World Cup title; Voeller
wants to guide Germany to its fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, neither man was his country's first choice for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari inherited the position after a succession of failures by
his predecessors, most notably at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and
the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was more or less a last resort
for the CBF, Brazil's soccer federation.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller, on the other hand, came to the rescue of the DFB,
Germany's soccer federation, after its chosen coach, Christoph Daum,
shot himself down in spectacular fashion by testing positive for
cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   And yet here they are, off the substitutes' bench, so to speak,
and one victory away from soccer's most prized trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari, 53, is a large man, blunt and to the point. He is willing
to do whatever it takes to win.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller, 42, is a little smoother. His temper can be just as fiery
as Scolari's, but he is more diplomatic outside the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   According to one colleague, Scolari, "says whatever is in his
stomach," a turn of phrase that fits the coach perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   He can be biting, acidic, scornful, impatient, brash,
temperamental--all these and more. But never boring.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Scolari on the sideline is almost as entertaining as
watching Brazil play. He is so demonstrative that the Brazilian TV
giant, O Globo, keeps one camera trained on him. No one ever knows
what he will say or do next.</TE>
<TE>   Many Brazilians, among them several former national team players,
disagreed strongly with his decisions in the months leading to the
World Cup, but his honesty is respected.</TE>
<TE>   In early May, when the media were calling him every name under the
Brazilian sun for leaving 1994 World Cup hero Romario off his squad,
Scolari said his duty was clear, no matter what was written or said
about him.</TE>
<TE>   "My son recently told me that winning is all that matters," he
said then. "It can only ever be like that because that's how
Brazilians are with football. There is this obligation to win."</TE>
<TE>   He put it another way too.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have to play ugly to reach our objective, we will play
ugly. What's the point of a Cup? To be champions."</TE>
<TE>   But Scolari's team has not played ugly. In fact, it delighted its
fans and those of neutral nations by playing fast, free-flowing
soccer in the early rounds, then showed the steel in its belly by
playing one man short and defeating England in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   That 2-1 come-from-behind victory has been the most satisfying of
all for Scolari.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coach, I have tremendous admiration for the previous [World
Cup] teams, for everything they have done for Brazil," he said
afterward. "But I have never seen a Brazilian team with such a strong
fighting spirit, with such a vibrant approach, as this team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this Brazil team is the ideal image of modern football.
In addition to our [other] qualities, we have fighting spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Voeller has instilled the same self-belief in his team, drawing on
his experience as a forward on the German team that lost to Argentina
in the final of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico City and then rebounded
four years later to defeat Argentina in the 1990 final in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to have a coach who has been through it all,"
said Kahn, the goalkeeper whose on-field play and off-field
leadership have given Voeller's cause an ideal champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I am realistic and aware of our limitations," Voeller said. "We
are a bit below teams like Brazil and England, who have more class
than we have, but with our team spirit and a collective effort, we
can beat any side."</TE>
<TE>   Voeller has tried to inspire his team by saying that it compares
favorably to the Cup-winning squad he played on 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "In all honesty, we were not so good in 1990," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That team won the final, 1-0. This team has won its last three
games by the same score.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that both coaches could revert to form Sunday and
that fans could be in for a dour battle.</TE>
<TE>   Possible, but unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Having let the three genies out the bottle, Scolari will find it
impossible to put Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho back in. Brazil
will attack, whether Scolari likes it or not.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, having gone this far on the talent of Kahn and the
fortitude of the defenders in front of him, Voeller will not suddenly
go on the offensive and run at Brazil. He simply doesn't have the
players to do it.</TE>
<TE>   So it will be Brazil's offense against Germany's defense, just as
it should be.</TE>
<TE>   But one can't help thinking that Scolari might rather be directing
the tough-as-nails German defenders and that Voeller might be far
happier if he were orchestrating the Brazilians' "Triple R" strike
force.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers' Problems Gone With Wins</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They increase lead to 21/2 games and win ninth
series in a row with 7-1 victory over Rockies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does good chemistry create winning, or does winning create good
chemistry? That question has been debated for years, and Dodger left
fielder Brian Jordan has no revelations on the subject, but it's
clear to him they've gone hand in hand for the Dodgers this season.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Daal gave up one run and four hits in six innings, and Shawn
Green, Jordan and Marquis Grissom homered Thursday night to lift the
Dodgers to a 7-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies before 41,279 in
Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers, minus the endless distractions caused by disgruntled
outfielder Gary Sheffield and the front-office upheaval caused by the
firing of general manager Kevin Malone last season, increased their
lead over the Arizona Diamondbacks to 2 1/2 games in the National
League West.</LD>
<TE>   They improved to 49-29, the first time since Sept. 27, 1996 the
Dodgers have been 20 games over .500, and completed a 10-3 home stand
by taking three of four games from Colorado. The Dodgers have won
eight of nine games and nine series in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed it in spring training--it's just a positive
environment," said Jordan, acquired from Atlanta with pitcher Odalis
Perez for Sheffield in January. "We have great chemistry now. The
bench is putting its piece in, the starters are putting their piece
in. It was a rough situation last year, from what I hear.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys aren't coming to the park worried about the media badgering
them. No disrespect to you guys, but now guys are listening to music,
cracking jokes, having fun ... everyone's happy. When you can do
that, it must mean you're winning."</TE>
<TE>   Daal (6-3) struck out three and walked two in a crisp, 91-pitch
effort, and four relievers closed Thursday's game, completing a
series in which the Dodgers limited Todd Helton and Larry Walker to
two hits in 20 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "That ranks up there with the best pitching we've seen all year,"
Helton said. "That's why they're in first place."</TE>
<TE>   Added Colorado Manager Clint Hurdle: "They manhandled us the last
three games."</TE>
<TE>   Kind of the way Green has manhandled opposing pitchers since
mid-May. Green hit a towering homer to center field in the first
inning, a solo shot that gave him 25 on the season, tying him with
San Francisco's Barry Bonds for second in the league. Green also
ranks second with 62 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Since his horrendous start--Green was batting .230 with three
homers and 21 RBIs on May 17--Green is batting .355 with 22 homers
and 41 RBIs in his last 34 games. He hit nine home runs during this
home stand and leads the major leagues with 12 homers and 27 runs
this month.</TE>
<TE>   Green is a lock to make the All-Star team, but as fan balloting
closed late Thursday, Green ranked 14th among NL outfielders with
only 188,648 votes and still trailed Pittsburgh's Armando Rios, who
is batting .257 with no homers and nine RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "Either we're not casting enough votes here or they're not staying
up late enough on the East Coast," said Dodger Manager Jim Tracy, who
will serve as an NL coach in the July 9 All-Star game. "I don't see
how it's possible he could not make the team with the virtual assault
that has taken place since mid-May."</TE>
<TE>   Green gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead Thursday night with his homer
off Colorado's Denny Neagle (4-5).</TE>
<TE>   "It's a loud noise, a very convincing noise," Tracy said of the
sound created by Green's recent homers. "You see this guy hit some
balls, they leave the bat and start upward, and you think he didn't
quite get it. Then you watch the ball continue to travel and travel
until the ballpark can no longer hold it."</TE>
<TE>   The stadium couldn't hold two other balls hit by the Dodgers, who
have hit 49 homers in the last 32 games. After Paul Lo Duca's RBI
single in the third, Jordan hit a two-run homer to left-center in the
fourth. Grissom followed by lining his 10th homer of the season into
the seats in left field, giving the Dodgers a 5-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek doubled to right, and Daal helped his cause with
an RBI double over the head of Walker in right field for a 6-0 lead.
The Rockies scored on Gary Bennett's solo homer in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing pretty good right now," Lo Duca said after the
Dodgers improved to 16-5 against left-handed starters. "The
Diamondbacks and Giants aren't going to go anywhere, but I don't
think we're going to go anywhere either."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Ex-Angel Manager Collins Arrested</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger minor league field coordinator Terry Collins, who managed the
Angels from 1997-99 and the Houston Astros from 1994-96, was arrested
early Thursday morning and charged with driving under the influence
of alcohol, according to the Richmond (Ga.) County Sheriff's Office.</LD>
<LD>   Collins, 53, was stopped on an Augusta, Ga., street at about 2
a.m. He was also charged with operating an unsafe vehicle and driving
without a license on his person.</LD>
<LD>   "He was driving on a flat tire, which is what drew our attention
to him," Maj. Richard Weaver of the Richmond County Sheriff's Office
told Rob Mueller of the Augusta Chronicle. "He just kept driving."</LD>
<TE>   Collins, who is in his first year with the Dodgers, stumbled out
of his vehicle after being pulled over, police said. "He was
staggering," Weaver said. "He was obviously impaired and failed a
sobriety test." Collins was arrested and taken to the Richmond County
Jail, where Weaver said he failed a Breathalyzer test.</TE>
<TE>   Collins, who was in Augusta to join the South Georgia Waves, the
Dodgers' affiliate in the Class-A South Atlantic League, remained in
jail for 14 hours before being released after meeting bond
requirements. He did not attend Thursday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Collins guided the Angels to a 214-235 record before resigning by
mutual consent in early September 1999, a season in which the Angels
finished last in the American League West. He was hired by Dodger
director of player development Bill Bavasi, who was the Angel general
manager during Collins' tenure in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been informed of the situation," Bavasi said, "and we're
handling it internally."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beltre has ended his media boycott, but the third baseman
said his refusal to speak to reporters for three weeks had nothing to
do with those covering the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I just don't want to talk to anyone because it reminds
me too much of how bad I'm playing," Beltre said. "The last few
weeks, I've had so much on my mind I'm going crazy. I wasn't enjoying
life at all. I wanted to get that all out of my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre was batting .283 on May 17 and was on such a roll Manager
Jim Tracy moved him from seventh to second in the order. But in the
next 36 games, Beltre is 23 for 128, his average sliding to .237, and
he has committed eight of his team-high 13 errors.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, only 23 but in his fourth full year in the big leagues,
has frustrated Tracy at times with his lackadaisical play and
inconsistent at-bats, so much so that he has been in the manager's
office for numerous closed-door meetings in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, who rarely criticizes his players publicly, even took a
shot at Beltre earlier this week, saying, "If there's one guy who
should have some Gold Glove awards on his mantel, it's him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve catcher Chad Kreuter, who developed a large hematoma, or
pooling of blood, on his left shin after bruising it during a
collision at second base against Boston on Sunday, was put on the
15-day disabled list after Thursday's game. He will be replaced by
David Ross, who was batting .276 with five homers and 30 RBIs for
triple-A Las Vegas.... Tracy has been selected by Arizona Manager Bob
Brenly to serve as a National League coach for the July 9 All-Star
game in Milwaukee. Tracy, who said he was "flattered to have the
opportunity," is the first Dodger manager since Tom Lasorda in 1993
to coach in the All-Star game.</TE>

<HD>Hockey Team Draws Bid of $2.3 Million on Ebay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the list of myriad uses for the Internet you can add one more:
unloading a bankrupt minor-league hockey team.</LD>
<LD>   The cash-strapped Anchorage Aces of the Western Hockey League drew
a high bid of $2.3 million Thursday in an auction on Ebay, making
them what is believed to be the first sports team that would ever be
sold on the site.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified buyer, whose purchase is pending a background
check as well as approval from the league and the bankruptcy court,
was the fifth person to bid on the team after it was posted on the
site Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Cusack, who has owned the Aces since 1995, had received
only one bid for $1.5 million through Wednesday night. Then three
came in Thursday before the $2.3-million offer, which topped the
previous high bid by $700,000.</TE>
<TE>   If the sale goes through, it would be the second-biggest
transaction ever for the Internet auctioneer, topped only by the sale
of a Gulfstream II business jet that went for $4.9 million in August.</TE>
<TE>   The buyer would take over a team that filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection last month, reportedly is about $2.2 million in
debt and finished with a league-worst 19-44 record last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not sure what was worth buying," Colby Coward, the club's
marketing director and acting general manager, said from Anchorage.
"There was no team anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the club's creditors, former King center Corey Millen and
his wife Kelly, Cusack's sister, aided in the search for a buyer.</TE>
<TE>   "We put it on Ebay because we had nothing to lose," Kelly told the
National Post. "It gets the word out there that we're looking for a
buyer."</TE>

<HD>Jaguar Players Suffer Burns From Fondue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Jacksonville Jaguar kicker Jaret Holmes and punter Chris Hanson were
severely burned when a fondue pot slipped and overturned.</LD>
<LD>   Both players have recovered from the accident, which occurred
while they were cooking at Hanson's home earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   Hanson sustained first- and second-degree burns on both hands and
his right ankle. He punts with his left foot. Hanson said Holmes also
sustained severe burns.</LD>
<TE>   Hanson's wife, Kasey, sustained second- and third-degree burns
that required skin grafts. She also has recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened so fast," Hanson told the Florida Times-Union. He
said they were moving the fondue pot when it slipped onto the tile
floor in his house.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, my wife fell into it," Hanson said. "I know it doesn't
sound like much, but it's been quite an ordeal."</TE>
<TE>   Hanson made the Jaguars' roster as a free agent last season and
had a 37.1-yard net average.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes, who signed with the Jaguars late last season as a kickoff
specialist, is one of three kickers competing to replace Mike Hollis.</TE>
<TE>   Both are expected to be fully recovered when training camp begins
July 25.</TE>
<TE>   Neither plans any more fondue meals.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already thrown out the pot," Hanson said.</TE>

<HD>Kent Proves to Be Big Hit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Jeff Kent doesn't think his new spot in the lineup made much of a
difference.</LD>
<LD>   Kent, batting third for the first time this season, drove in six
runs and led the San Francisco Giants over the San Diego Padres,
11-6, Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Kent was hitting in Barry Bonds' usual place, but believes his
success had more to do with finding the right pitches to hit.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want to be arrogant," Kent said. "I'm just trying to make
good on opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker tweaked his lineup, moving Kent from
cleanup to the spot ahead of Bonds. Baker said he flip-flopped them
to take pressure off Kent with Bonds walking so often--and because
Reggie Sanders was hitting well in the fifth slot.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup shift came two days after Bonds and Kent got into a
scuffle in the dugout in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Kent went three for five, getting key hits as the Giants overcame
an early 5-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   With the game tied, the bases loaded and two out in the sixth
inning, Kent doubled to the right-field wall off Jason Middlebrook
(1-3) to make it 8-5.</TE>
<TE>   Kent also had a two-run single in the third and an RBI double in
the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry's done a lot of damage against us, but Kent has killed us
too," Padre Manager Bruce Bochy said. "We seem to have trouble with
Kent whether he's batting third or fourth."</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear One and Only,</TE>
<TE>   I've got to admit, you still leave me speechless.</TE>
<TE>   Well, give or take the ensuing 1,250 words. For better (I should
complain about three columns a year?) or worse (then there's your
basketball team), you're still you after all these years.</TE>
<TE>   I do miss the lottery parties in Malibu with the tents and
starlets, but I'm sure your Westside friends had a good time
Wednesday, roaming around the front office and watching you play Man
of Decision with your basketball people.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, your basketball people are a little down after you
scuttled their deals for Baron Davis and Andre Miller, two of the
game's brightest young point guards.</TE>
<TE>   The way we hear it--from everyone, I might add--the deal with the
Cleveland Cavaliers, Miller for Darius Miles and your No. 8 and 12
picks, was going through ... until you decided hours before the draft
the Cavaliers could have Lamar Odom but not Miles.</TE>
<TE>   Improbably, or miraculously, your people then scrambled around and
were closing in on another deal--Odom, 8 and 12 to the New Orleans
Hornets for Davis--which should have been a no-brainer, because you
had just signed off on that package....</TE>
<TE>   But you nixed that too, saying something about not liking Baron's
flashy style.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Odom and Miles are gifted prospects. The problem is
there are two of them, competing for minutes with each other, not to
mention Quentin Richardson, Corey Maggette and Eric Piatkowski.</TE>
<TE>   As popular as Miles is, he isn't a starter, nor will he be one
soon, even if Odom had been traded.</TE>
<TE>   Nor can Odom be considered indispensable after you jumped three
places in the West last season while he played 29 games.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is either the shooter you need to complement an inside game
(you hope is) built around Elton Brand and Michael Olowokandi. Odom
and Miles have more potential, but because Richardson and Maggette
are better shooters, they're better fits.</TE>
<TE>   As you know, I've followed your act for a long time (for me, it's
like getting paid to watch Comedy Central), but this was an
all-timer. It ranks up there with the five years you spent insisting
Danny Manning wouldn't leave, the Glen Rice-for-Manning deal you
knocked down and the trade you finally OKd for Dominique
Wilkins--another upcoming free agent, whom you let walk away.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after you orchestrated this latest farce, you sat down with
our T.J. Simers, just to show how fearless you are these days.</TE>
<TE>   This yielded gems such as: "Why would people think I wouldn't pay
for the best?"</TE>
<TE>   I can't imagine.</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect to T.J., I've been around you longer and have
learned to translate what you say into the language we use in our
universe, which parallels yours.</TE>
<TE>   You said: "We would like to sign [Brand] for six years.... of all
the players we have, there is a clear consensus he belongs here as a
cornerstone of the franchise."</TE>
<TE>   This means: You already know that he'll stay if you'll pay him the
$120-million max, which you intend to do.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there appears to be just such an understanding, pleasing
Brand's agent, David Falk, who doesn't like to tarry with
negotiations before going abroad on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, you said signing Olowokandi is up to General
Manager Elgin Baylor: "If he wants Olowokandi, we'll have
Olowokandi."</TE>
<TE>   This means: There is no deal on Olowokandi and you don't like his
agent, Bill Duffy, running around telling everyone they want the max
too. If they keep that up, Baylor can just go out and find himself
another center.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, if Olowokandi gets out of here, it'll be Baylor's
fault, not yours.</TE>
<TE>   You said hitting the luxury tax threshold is "my No. 1 objective
in the universe."</TE>
<TE>   This means: nothing.</TE>
<TE>   You've said that stuff since they were taking the ball out of the
peach baskets. Back here on Earth, you're $7 million under the salary
cap and $17 million under the projected tax threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday was your crossroads. I actually thought the situation
was now so promising--not to mention profitable, with attendance
almost doubled over your last season in the Sports Arena, to 18,000 a
game--there was no way you could miss it, fail to enjoy it and do
what you had to do to keep it going.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, everywhere else, they thought you were the same old
Donald, which is why one team--Seattle--called up and offered cash
for your No. 12 pick.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper rebirth had gone on around you, with little
contribution needed from you. For three years, since moving the team
into Staples, you hadn't had to make a decision harder than agreeing
to Chicago's generous offer of Brand for your No. 1 pick.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Baylor, who had previously gotten you Olowokandi,
brought in Odom, Miles, Richardson, Maggette and Keyon Dooling. Last
season's payroll was $35 million--the league minimum--and Portland
and Phoenix paid $5 million of that to take Will Perdue and Vinny Del
Negro off their caps.</TE>
<TE>   This was crunch time. You had a young team with the size, talent,
character and chemistry to grow into a title contender in three or
four years when the Lakers' day was ebbing.</TE>
<TE>   What would you do under these new, different and wholly fortuitous
circumstances?</TE>
<TE>   The answer turned out to be the same: as little as you thought you
could get by with.</TE>
<TE>   I've got a surprise for you. If you aspire to the elite level,
you're going to have to do more than sign Brand and Olowokandi. There
isn't a person in basketball, within your organization or without,
who thinks you'll pay the dread Third Big Salary--which is why
everyone thinks you shot these deals down.</TE>
<TE>   Both Davis and Miller are free agents next summer, but you could
pay either $10 million a year, deal off a spare player or two and
still be at--not over--the tax threshold, which, we know, is your
"No. 1 objective in the universe."</TE>
<TE>   It's not even about money, because you're not only profitable but
assured of staying so for years. It's about tenacious, tight-fisted,
ego-asserting-despite-your-</TE>
<TE>   humble-manner control.</TE>
<TE>   It's just you being you. As we just learned, nothing changes that,
not bad times or even good ones.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, you aren't going to be able to win a title and then
pay for it. That's not how it works.</TE>
<TE>   At present, you don't even have a starting point guard. Jeff
McInnis played well, but he's a mouthy little guy and, worse, one
more free agent than you feel like dealing with while you're engaged
with Brand and Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis is as good as gone. Presumably that will turn out to be
Baylor's idea too. All you'll have at the point is Dooling, who
played 14 games last season and has started one NBA game; Earl
Boykins, who's great for an elf, and Marko Jaric, who's coming from
Europe, which makes him an NBA rookie.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you may still get Davis or Miller.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers won't max out Miller and Davis has told the Hornets
he won't re-sign. Both probably will be moved and you've got way more
to offer than anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, if the no-brainers are this hard, how will you
ever do stuff that's actually difficult?</TE>
<TE>   You keep wondering why your friend, Jerry Buss, wins and you
don't. He risks everything because he cares about winning, as opposed
to talking about it, as you do. And there are more owners out there
who care as much he does.</TE>
<TE>   But there's only one you.</TE>
<TE>   Promise you'll never leave me,</TE>

The Clippers appear overstocked at forward and light at point guard
after Wednesday's draft:
FORWARDS

<LD>The Molly Pitcher, a $300,000 race to be run Saturday at Monmouth
Park in New Jersey, is listed as a handicap. Boy, is it.</LD>
<LD>   Spain, the high weight and expected favorite in the Molly Pitcher,
is six weeks pregnant. The other four fillies and mares in the
race--we have to take them at their word on this--have yet to be
introduced to stallions.</LD>
<LD>   On top of her condition, Spain has been assigned 122
pounds--jockey Jorge Chavez and equipment--for the Molly Pitcher,
which is three to 11 pounds more than her rivals. Sean Greely, the
racing secretary at Monmouth, did not consider that Spain had been
successfully bred to Storm Cat--at $500,000, the world's most
expensive sire--at Overbrook Farm in Lexington, Ky., on May 15.
Spain's weight assignment is based on the fact that the 5-year-old
mare has won her last two races, is a Breeders' Cup distaff winner
and has earned $3.5 million, more than any female in the history of
U.S. racing.</LD>
<TE>   It is not completely unusual for mares in foal to continue racing,
although examples of such high-profile mares as Spain staying on the
track are rare. Caressing, a 4-year-old filly, was bred to Fusaichi
Pegasus, the 2000 Kentucky Derby winner, on April 21 and has resumed
training. In 1992, according to Blood-Horse magazine, the 6-year-old
Fit For A Queen was bred to Gulch in May and ran four times, all in
stakes, after that. After three consecutive second-place finishes,
Fit For A Queen won the Turfway Budweiser Breeders' Cup Stakes at
Turfway Park, when she was four months pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Spain was returned to trainer Wayne Lukas' barn at Churchill Downs
three days after she was bred to Storm Cat. The gestation period for
thoroughbreds is 11 months. Mares' embryos are slow developing in the
first months, and veterinarians have said that racing a mare up to
six months after she has been bred will cause no harm.</TE>
<TE>   Spain has already run one time with foal, winning the $329,400
Fleur de Lis Handicap at Churchill Downs on June 15. "She looked
terrific," Lukas said after that race. "She looked like she had
blossomed."</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks before that race--and 12 days before she was bred--Spain
won the Louisville Handicap at Churchill, ending an 11-race losing
streak and breaking the earnings record set by Serena's Song, another
distaffer trained by Lukas. Chasing Serena's Song's $3.2-million
record was one of the reasons Spain had been kept in training; since
her Breeders' Cup win, at 55-1, at Churchill in November 2000, she
had fallen off her form badly and had apparently forgotten how to
win. But now, once before pregnancy and once since, she has
consecutive victories for the first time since the summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After the Molly Pitcher, Spain is expected to run at least twice
more, in the Go For Wand Stakes on July 28 and the Personal Ensign on
Aug. 23. Both races are at Saratoga. Whether she can become one of
those Breeders' Cup rarities, a horse who runs in those races a third
time, is up in the air. In her second Breeders' Cup Distaff, last
October at Belmont Park, Spain lost by a head to Unbridled Elaine.
This year's Breeders' Cup will be run on Oct. 26 at Arlington Park,
and Spain would be more than five months pregnant by then. Lukas said
that the Breeders' Cup decision would be made by Prince Ahmed bin
Salman's Thoroughbred Corp., which bred and races Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Spain is a daughter of the Lukas-trained Thunder Gulch, the 1995
Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner, and Drina, a stakes-winning
mare who raced in the early 1990s and earned $205,682. Thunder Gulch,
a son of Gulch and a Kentucky-based stallion who stood for an $80,000
fee this breeding season, has been good for the prince. He was not a
popular stud at the start, when his fee was $40,000. His first
crop--66 horses who got to the races--won only 18 races and earned
less than $160,000. But then Spain and Salman's Point Given, winner
of last year's Preakness and Belmont, came along.</TE>
<TE>   Combined, Spain and Point Given have earned almost $7.5 million.
Point Given is at stud, retired last August because of a tendon
injury, but Spain, who has nine wins, nine seconds and six thirds, is
still going, at least for two or three more races. The Molly Pitcher
will be her 35th start. It's a handicap, all right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to keep up with her stablemate Azeri, Astra will carry
high weight of 124 pounds, spotting her eight rivals between eight
and 12 pounds, in Saturday's $250,000 Beverly Hills Handicap. Azeri,
who has seven wins and one second in eight starts, won the Vanity
Handicap Saturday. Astra, with 10 wins in 14 races, can become the
first back-to-back winner of the Beverly Hills since Flawlessly in
1992-93.... Corey Nakatani, recovering from a concussion suffered in
a spill on May 2, is scheduled to resume riding next week.... In his
first workout since the Belmont, War Emblem went three furlongs in
:35 4/5 at Santa Anita on Wednesday.... Milwaukee Brew, who'll be
favored in the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup on July 14, worked five
furlongs in 1:00 4/5.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to upsets on Thursday by the likes of Demidoll, Pickled Bay
and Pam And Gayla, tonight's card at Hollywood Park became a lot more
interesting.</LD>
<LD>   There is a pick six carry-over of $406,192 awaiting, and the
surest bet on the card is probably in the fourth race.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-1 favorite on the morning line in the 6 1/2-furlong sprint
for $25,000 maiden fillies and mares is Devlish and the 3-year-old
filly, although not particularly fast, has been consistent.</LD>
<TE>   In three races since she was claimed for $32,000 by trainer
Leonard Duncan for owner Tom Thom, Devlish has finished second each
time at odds of 5-2, 9-5 and 3-5.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett Gomez has been the rider on all three occasions and will
be aboard again tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth is one of four maiden races on the program and one of
three in the pick six.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Valenzuela, the runaway leader in the jockey standings,
could extend his lead. He is named on six horses and four are
favorites on Russ Hudak's morning line.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth is a 1 1/16-mile turf race for $32,000
3-year-olds and contention runs deep in the field of 10. Pick-six
players will be spreading.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Todd Pletcher. The trainer won two more races at
Belmont Park on Thursday and has taken over the lead in the
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Julio and Nick Canani. The father-and-son trainers have
the distinction of having put Hall of Fame riders on their final
losers. Julio Canani trained Patchy Groundfog, who was fourth in Bill
Shoemaker's last race in 1990, and Nick Canani trains Come Back
Ronnie, who provided Chris McCarron with his final loss when he was
third last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the third keying Comte Du
Rainier on top of Ron Cherry and Dog Days in the two hole and all in
the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/123. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $0/$711. Total money bet: $806.</TE>

<DH>Angel prospect Jenks has a blazing fastball, but
off-the-field problems earn him a demotion</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Getting strikeouts has always been easy for Bobby Jenks, whether it
was throwing tennis balls past his brothers in the backyard or
blazing a fastball by a minor leaguer.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old right-hander has a 100-mph fastball and was
compared to Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling when the Angels broke
training camp this spring.</LD>
<LD>   But only a few months later, it's Jenks who has two strikes
against him.</LD>
<TE>   He has been demoted from the Angels' double-A affiliate in
Arkansas for what club officials consider repeated acts of
immaturity.</TE>
<TE>   So instead of quickly climbing the ladder to triple-A, one rung
shy of the majors, Jenks has fallen to Class A, where tonight he will
make his second start for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes.</TE>
<TE>   With the Quakes, Jenks will attempt to reestablish himself as a
top prospect. Certainly there are few concerns about the 6-foot-3,
245-pounder's arm. With Arkansas, Jenks had 58 strikeouts in 58
innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are hoping the demotion will be a wakeup call. "In
order to succeed and become a successful major league player, it
takes both on and off-field focus," Angel General Manager Bill
Stoneman said. "I know Bobby wants it, and we're doing our best to
help him find that focus."</TE>
<TE>   Jenks and two other Arkansas pitchers each were suspended for
seven games after they were caught with beer on the team bus,
baseball sources said. Jenks' other transgressions have not been
disclosed, but Stoneman said none had any serious legal
ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   As he pedaled on a stationary bike before a game earlier this
week, Jenks acknowledged the need to get his act together.</TE>
<TE>   "I let them down," he said of the Angels. "We all had our talk and
they know it's not going to be a serious thing. It's going to be a
bump in the road."</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew him before he signed with the Angels aren't
surprised that Jenks' first years in professional baseball have had
rough stretches.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great kid, but his upbringing obviously left many things
untaught," said Mark Potoshnik, a Seattle-area youth baseball coach.
"Decision-making and things like that were never really anything that
was taught in his family.</TE>
<TE>   "He was more [used to] hang-out-and-do-whatever-you-do type
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Jenks was living with his family in Spirit Lake, Idaho, and had
dropped out of high school when Potoshnik, who had coached him
before, asked Jenks to move in with him and attend Inglemoor High
near Seattle so that he would retain his eligibility in the 2000
draft.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Potoshnik was setting up workouts so that big league
scouts could get a look at Jenks' fastball.</TE>
<TE>   Angel scout Jack Uhey was impressed. "He had a loose and easy
arm," Uhey said. "He finished the fastball and had the makings of a
plus-curveball. He seemed like he was a good kid."</TE>
<TE>   Uhey found Jenks' pleasant nature all the more impressive after
his first visit to Jenks' home, what the scout describes as "a cabin
in the woods." Uhey said Jenks' father, Rob, seemed detached from the
conversation and didn't ask many questions about the Angels' interest
in his son.</TE>
<TE>   "The guidance was not there," Uhey said.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at the family's new home in Tacoma, Wash., Jenks' mother,
Carla, was angered by the way some Angel officials have characterized
her family in newspaper stories about her son.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a fine boy and he's turned out well," she said of
her son.</TE>
<TE>   Jenks also came to his parents' defense, saying they have served
as role models. "They've both believed in me and knew I could do it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Uhey said he was so disconcerted by the home visit that when Donny
Rowland, the Angels' director of scouting, saw Jenks pitch and
discussed taking him in the second round, Uhey said, "No way."</TE>
<TE>   Usually it is the other way around--the scouting director dampens
the area scout's enthusiasm for a prospect. But the Angels did get
Jenks--in the fifth round.</TE>
<TE>   "Stuff-wise, he was a higher pick than we took him," Uhey said.
"But based on the baggage, his past and the lack of guidance, no one
wanted to invest the money in a guy like that."</TE>
<TE>   After a rough first season with the Angels' rookie team in Butte,
Mont.--he had more walks than strikeouts and was 1-7 with a 7.86
earned-run average--Jenks began showing flashes of promise in his
second pro season.</TE>
<TE>   He earned a trip to double A during spring training, where he was
3-6 with a 4.66 ERA at the time of his demotion. Wildness was his
biggest drawback. Although he was averaging a strikeout per inning,
he also averaged seven walks per nine innings.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the demotion, a sign, Uhey said, that the Angels were
willing to dole out discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "When he slips off track, we need to get him back on track," the
scout said.</TE>
<TE>   In Jenks' first outing for the Quakes, he earned a victory, giving
up two hits and one run in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out six and
walked six.</TE>
<TE>   But more impressive, Quake pitching coach Zeke Zimmerman said, has
been Jenks' work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing two-a-day workouts, he's busting his butt," Zimmerman
said. "He's been a leader in the clubhouse, vocal. He's got a smile
on his face.</TE>
<TE>   "If I wouldn't have known the history, I wouldn't have known
anything [was wrong] because he's not only been a good player but
he's been a good teammate."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jenks: "I don't regret what happened. But it has changed my
work ethic. I think I need to be able to start doing a little bit
better. Looking at it that way, it's helped me."</TE>
<TE>   Jenks said he derives most of his support from his wife, Adele,
who he met at a drive-in hamburger restaurant and married at age 20.
The couple have a 5-month-old daughter, Cuma, and were hoping to
celebrate their first wedding anniversary tonight. Jenks said there
is plenty to celebrate, even though he hasn't yet reached the heights
some were expecting.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't disappoint me that I'm not in triple-A right now," he
said. "I'm going to get there sooner or later, maybe even this year.
I just want to pitch well this season and get myself out of the rut I
dug myself and get back all the trust that I [lost] from the people
in the organization. As soon as I do that, I'll be all right."</TE>

<LD>Twelve days after a disqualification, Fly Home First will try again
for his third victory in tonight's $15,000 Mega Dash Handicap at 550
yards.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Debra Horrocks and the Double Bar S Ranch and trained by
Dan Francisco, Fly Home First won an allowance race by a neck June
16, then was dropped to sixth place for interference after veering
in.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old Strawfly Special gelding will break from the rail
under jockey Eddie Garcia as he stretches an additional 200 yards. He
finished third, beaten by 1 1/4 lengths by War And Remembrance, the
last time he tried 550 yards.</LD>
<TE>   Because of their common ownership, Fly Home First will be coupled
with Youcancallmefly, who will break directly outside of him under
jockey Joe Badilla Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Streakn Cheyenne. 2. Got Some Fortune. 3. Tam's
Rebelette. 4. Hesmyking. 5. First Royal Princess. 6. Icey Gambler. 7.
First Steps Special. 8. Im A Pritzi Boy. 9. Fly Home First. 10. Sport
Report.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Streakn Cheyenne and Amender in the first, Got Some
Fortune, Why Should I Care and First Down Chicky in the second, Tam's
Rebelette and Bemsha Swing in the third and Slippery Smith, Hesmyking
and Debs Silver Shadow in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Priscillas New Doc was eliminated at the break
a week ago and could make amends in tonight's fifth. Spit Happens
steps up to the $12,500 level in the eighth after having been claimed
for $6,250 by trainer Jaime Gomez.</TE>

<HD>Irate Stewart Hopes Blocking Is a Passing Fad</HD>

<LD>If Tony Stewart had his way, NASCAR's Winston Cup series would be run
the way races are run for midget and sprint cars--without spotters or
rear-view mirrors.</LD>
<LD>   After last weekend, during which the outspoken Stewart won a U.S.
Auto Club sprint car race at Altamont Park on Saturday night and
finished second to Ricky Rudd in a Winston Cup race Sunday at
Infineon Raceway near Sonoma, he minced no words in blasting the
blocking tactics of fellow NASCAR drivers, Rudd among them, indicting
CART and IRL racing in the process.</LD>
<LD>   "There were a lot of damn 'Indy car drivers' out there and all
they wanted to do was block," he said. "There weren't any of them
that wanted to race you clean. If they can't beat you in the corner,
they would just as soon block you in the corner."</LD>
<TE>   Blocking has become a favorite tactic since the duties of spotters
were expanded. When posting spotters high up in or atop the stands
and putting them in radio contact with drivers became popular, it was
to inform drivers of accidents, to warn them of trouble ahead and to
help steer them through the debris.</TE>
<TE>   The need for such help is more important in Winston Cup than in
any other racing series because of NASCAR's rule that when a yellow
caution flag appears, drivers race back to the finish line--even if
the accident is between them and the line.</TE>
<TE>   As spotting became more sophisticated, however, the men in the
stands became coaches, telling their drivers who was behind them, if
another driver coming up on the outside or the inside, which was the
best way to block a potential pass.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting worse and worse," Stewart said. "Hopefully, that's
going to change. The way it is, we're going to have Indy car racing
with stock car bodies on them before long, unless someone decides to
make some changes. If not, we're going to start punting guys out of
the way."</TE>
<TE>   Even if one of them happens to be the eventual race winner.</TE>
<TE>   "We got up to Ricky [Rudd] when Ricky was behind Bill Elliott,"
Stewart added. "Every time he got in a braking zone, Ricky wanted to
block. I'll tell you what, he's ready for Indy car racing. He's
learned how to do that. I think he's missed his calling, he'd be a
great Indy car driver.</TE>
<TE>   "Drivers are doing it at every racetrack we go to these days and
it's getting frustrating. If they want to go Indy car racing and
block, go Indy car racing. This is a stock car series and if a guy
gets a run on you and has done a good job, it's your job to do a
better job the next lap and try to figure out why he got a run on you
instead of blocking."</TE>
<TE>   Both CART and IRL spokesmen said that blocking, although it
sometimes happens, is not condoned in open-wheel racing.</TE>
<TE>   "Blocking was a problem back in 1994-5-6 in CART, but not
anymore," said Adam Saal, CART director of communications. "If the
steward feels he sees unwarranted blocking, the driver gets a
warning, or if it's flagrant, he can be black-flagged."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Nation, IRL public-relations vice president, said, "Maybe
Tony's been away too long. He ought to come back and race with us
again and see how we race."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was the IRL's first champion, in the 1996-97 season,
before leaving for NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   When Stewart won the sprint car race at Altamont with a last-lap
pass, it made him a winner in a record nine USAC series--Silver
Crown, national sprint, national midget, western sprint, western
midget, TQ midget, 16th Street Midget, Speedrome midget and western
regional sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Winston Cup has a weekend off but Stewart isn't waiting for the
Pepsi 400 at Daytona on July 6 to go racing. He will team with
veteran Elliott Forbes-Robinson in a Judd-powered Crawford in the
Jani-King Paul Revere 250 in the sports racing prototype class on the
infield course at Daytona July 4.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys play golf, some guys fish for relaxation," said
Stewart. "Driving a race car is my relaxation. Last Saturday night, I
drove in front of about 6,500 fans and when I came to the track
Sunday I had a good fresh outlook. It was a great pick-me-up before
the Winston Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Perris Auto Speedway</TE>
<TE>   Motorcycles will take over the half-mile clay oval Saturday night
when former grand national champion Gene Romero brings his West Coast
Flat Track series to Perris for a tourist trophy race. The infield
course will include eight turns and one jump. It will be the first
such race in the area since 1986 at Ascot Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Sprint Car Racing Assn. will hold a special Fourth of July
race Thursday night, featuring its new all-time winner, Cory
Kruseman. When the Ventura driver made a daring last-turn pass of
Damion Gardner in Saturday night's main event, it gave him a record
56th SCRA win, one more than Rip Williams.</TE>
<TE>   After the July 4 race, Perris will host the dwarf car and
lightning sprint car nationals on Friday and Saturday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Speedway</TE>
<TE>   Fourth of July fireworks will come early at Irwindale, which has
its annual celebration Saturday night after a busy night of NASCAR
stock car racing featuring super late models, Grand American
modifieds and super trucks, plus a demolition derby postponed from
June 15.</TE>
<TE>   Infineon Raceway</TE>
<TE>   A remarkable transformation occurred between 10:30 and 11 a.m.
Saturday when Sears Point Raceway became Infineon Raceway.</TE>
<TE>   While track owner Bruton Smith was making the announcement in the
winner's circle, every sign on the property was changed, even the
brick one at the track's entrance, and course workers, security
personnel and the cleanup crew switched shirts to ones with the
Infineon logo. The pace car for the Winston Cup weekend, which had
been on the track earlier in the day with Sears Point Raceway on its
sides, had the new name in place when Smith dramatically lifted the
curtain covering it. Even the Ford, Chevrolet, Pontiac and Dodge
manufacturers' media center stationery, which carried quotes from
their drivers, was changed.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if Sears Point had never existed.</TE>
<TE>   Infineon, which has a 10-year contract with the race site, is a
German semiconductor manufacturer with North American headquarters in
San Jose. If Infineon sounds at least slightly familiar, that may be
because it sponsored the winning car at LeMans earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Triumph motorcycles will celebrate the manufacturer's 100th
anniversary Sunday in Pasadena when the Triumph Ride Across America
ends at 2 p.m. at the Elks lodge, about a block from where the
original Johnson Motors shop opened in 1936 to distribute the
British-made cycles. The ride started June 16 in New Hampshire. Among
the riders expected to be on hand are Eddie Wirth, who went from
cycles to winning a CRA sprint car championship; Skip Van Leeuwen,
Eddie Mulder, Sammy Tanner, Dick Hammer and Bud Ekins.</TE>
<TE>   A plaque in memory of Jeff Krosnoff, the CART driver from La
Canada who was killed in a race in 1996 at Exhibition Place in
Toronto, and track worker Gary Avrin will be unveiled Wednesday,
replacing a makeshift memorial that has stood at the site of the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   The site was an elm tree that Krosnoff's car struck, resulting in
the two deaths. When it became known that the elm tree was dying of
disease, the new memorial plaque was planned.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Carmody of Valencia clinched the USAC Russell Racing pro
series championship with a third-place finish Saturday at Infineon
Raceway.... The Desert Sprint, an 80-mile race for motorcycles as
part of the Corky McMillin Company Superstition Championship series,
will be run Sunday east of Plaster City, Calif. Aaron Tuck of Brawley
is the points leader after three of six events.</TE>
<TE>   Les Richter, former Riverside International Raceway operator and
current vice president of special events for International Speedway
Corp., will receive the "Friend of the Hungry" award at California
Speedway during the "Taste of the Inland Empire--Your Passport to End
Hunger" day. The event benefits the Second Harvest Food Bank of
Riverside and San Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Bud Thompson, a fixture of the California Racing Assn. for many
years as owner of son Dean's sprint car and a mechanic with Bruce
Bromme, has died at 83 of heart problems.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Marge, a daughter, Barbara, and son,
Dean, a three-time CRA champion in the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Ostertag Donates Kidney to His Sister</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With laughter and high hopes, Utah Jazz center Greg Ostertag donated
a kidney Thursday to his younger sister, whose kidneys failed in
March.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas said
Ostertag and his sister, Amy Hall, were recovering well.</LD>
<LD>   "It just clicked, it couldn't have gone better," said surgeon
Robert Goldstein, who also did Mickey Mantle's liver transplant at
the medical center in 1995. "It's already working wonderfully. She
very quickly will start feeling better."</LD>
<TE>   Hall, 26, has had type 1 diabetes since she was 7. Her kidney
problems began three years ago, and in March it was determined she
needed a new organ. Tests showed her brother to be a perfect donor.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of career-threatening complications are low. Ostertag
should be able to report to training camp on time.</TE>
<TE>   Ostertag, 29, will try to become the second player in three years
to return to the NBA with only one kidney. Sean Elliott went back to
the San Antonio Spurs after getting a kidney from his brother in
March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz also reported that John Stockton had surgery on his right
elbow six weeks ago, but owner Larry Miller still hopes the
40-year-old point guard returns for a 19th season.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Stockton signed a two-year contract but indicated
after the playoffs that he hadn't made a decision about next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yao Ming, the NBA's No. 1 draft pick, said he's looking forward to
battling with the best in the league.</TE>
<TE>   A day after making basketball history with his selection by the
Houston Rockets, the 7-foot-5 Yao worked out with the Chinese
national team and pledged one day to best the Lakers' Shaquille
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a mountain in my way," Yao said. "I will try to conquer it
by all means. My first tries may turn out to be failures, but I will
continue with others."</TE>
<TE>   Yao, 22, became the first foreign-born player who had not played
American college ball to be picked No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Is he worried about all the pressure?</TE>
<TE>   "I already feel it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yao's solid moves and shooting are a rare combination in a player

<LD>Twelve holes into his first U.S. Senior Open, R.W. Eaks was thinking
about shooting a 59.</LD>
<LD>   Eaks, who has never won a PGA event of any kind, settled for a
seven-under-par 64, which tied the tournament record and gave him a
three-shot lead over Tom Watson after Thursday's opening round at
Owings Mills, Md.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm kind of disappointed I didn't shoot a 63, actually," said
Eaks, who had an eagle, eight birdies and three bogeys on a difficult
Caves Valley course that yielded only nine sub-par rounds on a
sweltering day.</LD>
<TE>   Play was suspended for the day by lightning with 33 players left
on the course.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A panel of sports professionals and educators will examine ways to
improve the 30-year-old law that has greatly increased opportunities
for women in school sports, Education Secretary Rod Paige told a
Senate committee Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The new Commission on Opportunity in Athletics is being formed in
the wake of a lawsuit that argues that the law, known as Title IX,
helps women's sports at the expense of programs for men.</LD>
<LD>   "Some would like to settle this in the courts," Paige said. "But
we believe the better approach is to discuss all the questions
openly, in a forum where all voices and all viewpoints can be heard.
The members of this commission are on the front lines, facing the
difficult issues in athletics every day."</LD>
<TE>   Paige said the 15-member commission will be headed by Cynthia
Cooper, former WNBA All-Star who resigned as coach of the league's
Phoenix Mercury on Wednesday, and Ted Leland, director of athletics
at Stanford.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharon Moores was asked this week to describe the mood along the
Central California coast, particularly that of the people who work at
one of its oldest sportfishing operations, Virg's Landing in Morro
Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Her answer was predictable and compelling.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd say the mood is mostly one of fear and apprehension," she
said. "People are wondering what they can do, where they can go. Some
of them can run oil boats--most of them love the ocean and that's why
they do this, so they'll make the change. And some are too old to
make a change. I really don't know what we can do at this point."</LD>
<TE>   Moores, president of Virg's Landing and daughter of Virg Moores,
who founded the Morro Bay facility in 1954, was referring to the
uncertainty many landing operators, captains and crew members face in
light of rockfish closures announced last week by federal and state
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency closures, which go into effect Monday, affect
commercial and recreational fishermen and are designed largely to
protect bocaccio, a particularly embattled species of shelf rockfish,
according to scientists.</TE>
<TE>   The new restrictions ban fishing for any species of rockfish
(commonly lumped together and called rock cod) in waters 120 feet and
deeper. They will remain in effect throughout the year, when new
regulations will go into effect.</TE>
<TE>   The new federal regulations, which will be adopted by the Pacific
Fishery Management Council in September (after which the California
Fish and Game Commission will follow suit), could be even more
restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   Among many options being considered:</TE>
<TE>   * No fishing for rockfish deeper than 60 feet, with a five-fish
bag limit for nearshore rockfish (reduced from 10). Also, there would
be a complete closure in all waters in March and April.</TE>
<TE>   * No fishing for rockfish beyond 120 feet and a seven-fish bag
limit of nearshore rockfish. Under this option, there will be a total
closure in March, April, November and December.</TE>
<TE>   * No fishing for rockfish beyond 120 feet and with a 10-fish bag
limit of nearshore rockfish, but a six-month total closure from
November through April.</TE>
<TE>   Under all options, the take of bocaccio, cow cod, canary and
yellow-eye rockfish would be prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   It should be pointed out that under the closures that go into
effect Monday, fishing for other species beyond 120 feet is still
allowed. But anyone found to be in possession of rockfish or lingcod
(the ban also includes sculpin and ocean whitefish) in those waters,
even if they were caught inside of 120 feet, will be in violation.</TE>
<TE>   This means that skippers no longer will have the option of fishing
inside for nearshore rockfish, then moving into deeper water and
targeting halibut, bass, barracuda, bonito or yellowtail.</TE>
<TE>   Inside of 120 feet, fishermen can catch and keep a total of 10
nearshore species of rockfish (with the exception of bocaccio, cow
cod, canary rockfish and yellow-eye rockfish). They also can keep two
lingcod.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency closures, while many knew they were coming in some
form or another, could have been worse. The PFMC's science panel had
recommended closing waters beyond 60 feet.</TE>
<TE>   But nobody's celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   At Virg's Landing, for example, deep-water rockfish is their bread
and butter. As for alternatives, they're still targeting salmon, with
some success, and hoping for the weather to calm down so they can
start sending boats out for albacore. But albacore seasons sometimes
fail to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   "And the problem with alternatives like that is that it's nothing
you can depend on year-round," said John Rowley, 58, a captain who
has been at the landing since 1970. "The bigger problem is, young
people don't want to go into this business anymore because they see
the handwriting on the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Rowley's mother, Rita Gartrell, used to run boats out of the
landing and his wife, Sharon Rowley, still does.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and my wife both say that we're sure glad that we're at the
age that we can almost be done with this," Rowley said. "We're going
to stick it out as long as we can because our kids are raised and we
don't have many bills anymore. It's just me and my wife now, but we
wouldn't be able to do this if we were just starting out."</TE>
<TE>   Rowley, like most captains, is particularly frustrated by the
recent turn of events because he does not agree with the scientists
who have painted--using mostly the results of studies conducted north
of Point Conception--such a broad picture of gloom as to the state of
the rockfish fishery.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that if they look where there isn't any fish
they're not going to find any," Rowley said. "If they ask me to take
them where the [bocaccio] are, I'll take them right to them. I can
catch them easier and faster now than in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the landing will survive, Moores said she believes so.
Aside from fishing trips, the landing--which has six sportfishing
vessels and a bait boat--conducts whale-watching excursions to
coincide with the annual gray whale migration, from December through
May.</TE>
<TE>   It also is involved with a new program called Sea Life Studies,
which takes school-age children on natural history and estuary tours.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one direction we can go, but it's going to take time to
develop," Moores said. "We all say the landing will survive because
it has survived for so long, while others up here haven't. We'll just
see."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the closures are being viewed in Northern California,
Capt. Roger Thomas of the Salty Lady out of Sausalito said he'd first
rather talk about something positive, such as a salmon bite he called
"nothing short of unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   But with customers aboard the Salty Lady busy reeling in 20- to
40-pound salmon during a season that closes Nov. 10, Thomas, who is
also president of the Golden Gate Fishermen's Assn., said the
closures are the main subject on the waterfront.</TE>
<TE>   The fleets within the bay should fair reasonably well, Thomas
said, with other species such as halibut, striped bass and sturgeon
to keep them busy.</TE>
<TE>   But the smaller fleets from Monterey to Fort Bragg, he added, "are
in deep trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those fleets rely heavily on deep-water rockfish and make
regular runs to places like Cordell Bank, a sprawling offshore
seamount that now will be off limits.</TE>
<TE>   One such landing is Bodega Bay Sportfishing, which already has
formulated alternative trips, one of them being a combination
shallow-water salmon-rockfish-lingcod trip.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going out of business, not for a couple of more weeks,
anyway," manager Sophia Powers joked. "Seriously, we're just going to
continue to do the best we can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, the pinch will be particularly painful in
the Oxnard-Santa Barbara areas, but landing operators all the way to
San Diego will feel it.</TE>
<TE>   "Hell, for seven months out of the year that's all we target,"
said Don Ashley, owner of Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach. "Our crews
are already cutting their throats because they don't know what else
to do. It's ugly and that's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Oefinger, owner of Marina del Rey Sportfishing, said the
closure will affect only one of his vessels, the Betty O, the fleet's
matriarch, which has been targeting deep-water rockfish almost
exclusively since 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "That has been his run, and now it's dead," Oefinger said of the
boat's owner, Mike Reinsch. Oefinger added that the rest of his fleet
does not need any more competition for shallow-water species, and
that he and Reinsch were hopeful of putting the boat to good use,
perhaps by getting it more involved with youth fishing programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst part is that Mike is seeing just piles of rockfish out
there, more than at any time in the past 15-18 years," Oefinger said.
"I'm all for restrictive measures when they're needed, but to impose
a zero-take on us like this ... is unwarranted and damaging."</TE>

shinguards.</TE>
<TE>   When Pele and Beckenbauer talk, people listen. From the
perspective of the Brazilian and German players who have had their
ears burned from Ulsan to Saitama, that has been part of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Pele, Brazil's greatest soccer icon, may be the best offensive
player in the history of the game. Beckenbauer, Germany's most famous
soccer hero, may be the greatest defender the sport has seen.
Wherever in the world they roam, they arrive with unquestioned
credibility, ready-made soap boxes and a glaring impatience for
Brazilian and German soccer teams lacking players with the skill and
genius of Pele and Beckenbauer.</TE>
<TE>   According to Pele, 61, when queried at various times throughout
the World Cup, Brazil has played far too defensively, and not nearly
defensively enough.</TE>
<TE>   According to Beckenbauer, 56, Germany has been "average" and
"inadequate," the byproduct of a roster that doesn't feature "any bad
players, but at the same time there aren't any truly good ones
either."</TE>
<TE>   Before Brazil's quarterfinal match against England, Pele said that
"everybody knows Brazil have big problems in defense," right before
Brazil went out and defeated England, 2-1, and then went out after
that and shut out Turkey, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   In six matches in the tournament, all Brazilian victories, Brazil
has yielded four goals.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Pele told the Web site fifaworldcup.com that
Ronaldo "is only playing at 70% of his potential. He is afraid to
push himself to 100%" because of a serious knee injury he sustained
in mid-2000. "He didn't want to give 100% during the qualifying
games. But even now he is still afraid, and at only 70% of his level.
Sometimes he pushes, but sometimes he pulls back in a game."</TE>
<TE>   At 70%, Ronaldo leads 100% of the other scorers in this
tournament, having scored his sixth goal in six matches to deliver
Brazil to its third consecutive World Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   After Germany's quarterfinal match against the United States,
Beckenbauer wrote in the German newspaper Bild: "To put it bluntly,
if we did not have [goalkeeper] Ollie Kahn we would have been sent
home a long time ago. We've barely scraped through in every match
except for the match against the Saudis, who practically invited us
into their goal."</TE>
<TE>   This was after Germany had opened the World Cup with an 8-0
thrashing of Saudi Arabia, but days before it defeated South Korea,
1-0, to advance to its seventh World Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   So you want to be a traditional World Cup power?</TE>
<TE>   You try forever playing in the shadows and up to the expectations
of two of the game's biggest icons, in a couple of soccer-insane
countries, where today is never good enough because Pele and
Beckenbauer are always there to remind you about yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   There are distinct advantages to doing your work for a so-called
"Third World soccer country," a "developing soccer nation" such as
the U.S. Who's going to badger Landon Donovan for the chances he
missed--taken against Germany, in a World Cup quarterfinal? Eric
Wynalda? Bruce Arena didn't have to hesitate before cracking open the
sports section the morning after the 1-0 loss to Germany. What, Steve
Sampson is going to criticize him for not using the 3-6-1?</TE>
<TE>   But Brazil always has Pele looking over its shoulder and Germany
always has Beckenbauer to try to impress. Bill Walton may not be a
household name in Rio and Berlin, but rest assured: Brazilian and
German soccer players are quite familiar with what NBA veterans know
as Bill Walton Syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Before the semifinal with Turkey, Pele fretted for his country,
telling the Japan Times he wasn't optimistic about Brazil's chances
because Ronaldinho, out with a one-game red-card suspension, "makes a
big difference to the team. For Brazil at this time, it's a big loss,
bigger than the possible loss of Ronaldo."</TE>
<TE>   Beckenbauer, meanwhile, had less-than-practical advice for
Germany's coach, Rudi Voeller. Beckenbauer suggested Voeller should
keep his goalkeeper, Kahn, and replace the rest of the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Rudi could put the whole team in a bag," Beckenbauer wrote in
Bild, "and aside from Kahn, no matter who he pulls out to put on the
field, it would be the right choice."</TE>
<TE>   Beckenbauer, coach of Germany's last World Cup champion in 1990,
added, "I would have felt personally insulted as the trainer if my
team had delivered a performance like [the one against the U.S.]. In
1990, after we played a weak match against 10 Czechs, I threw a
bucket filled with ice across the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to feel it for themselves that they have to
raise their game."</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, that's what the Germans did against South Korea. At a
Thursday news conference in Yokohama, Beckenbauer was all grins,
talking about how "impressive" Germany was in the semifinal and
teasing Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of Brazil's 1994 World Cup
winner, about the troubles awaiting Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho
in the final as they approach the daunting task of trying to put one
past the mighty Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   Pele too is happier now, although he is careful not to tout Brazil
as the favorite in the final. "They have done well," he said, "but I
don't want to say they are the favorites because all those who have
been made favorites have failed."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Brazil and Germany watchers predict this relative calm
could last awhile. Days, even. All the way up to, but not necessarily
including, Sunday's opening kickoff.</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers play the Angels tonight at Edison Field. Both teams are
fighting for playoff position and division titles. This should be a
time to get excited about baseball. But should we feel guilty about
getting excited?</LD>
<LD>   It is clear that some baseball players are using steroids. Maybe
more than some. But nothing is going to be done about steroid use and
the mockery it may be making of ageless records and the achievements
of long-gone heroes. No one has any incentive to do anything.</LD>
<LD>   There is a channel-surfing stopper of a television commercial that
makes this so clear.</LD>
<TE>   Major League Baseball is promoting its Milwaukee All-Star game and
its summer Home Run Derby by featuring top players as humongous,
comically over-muscled caricatures.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Martinez, the thin Red Sox pitcher, has a chest the size of
a house in this ad. The bulging muscles in Barry Bonds' arms tear
through his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Just the image you'd want when there are so many questions about
Bonds, who turns 38 next month, and how he is breaking records he
couldn't dream about 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa seems barely able to stand upright, so overly large are
his chest and forearms. The commercialized Jason Giambi could flatten
all of Southern California if he were to topple over, something
likely to happen so top-heavy is the character.</TE>
<TE>   This is what Major League Baseball officials see as the best way
to turn fans on to the graceful game of summer--by making its big
names appear to be on massive doses of steroids. Baseball is being
marketed as professional wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   And why not?</TE>
<TE>   Don't fans buy into this image?</TE>
<TE>   Ballparks are filled with fans there to see if Bonds can swat
another homer into the bay. How many think about how it can be that a
38-year-old man is bigger, stronger, quicker than when he was 26.
Until now, nature allowed a 26-year-old athlete to be physically more
impressive than a 38-year-old athlete. The 38-year-old, though, had
the advantage of wisdom, experience, of knowing the shortcuts and the
tricks. Now we have a 38-year-old with all that wisdom and experience
and a body better conditioned than when he was 26.</TE>
<TE>   Fans want the pop. Fans want Sosa and Bonds hitting rockets. Fans
won't be so quick to pay for the privilege of watching the home run
champion hit 40 while threatening no records. The Mark McGwire-Sosa
battle showed that. We don't get excited for a home run race. We need
a record-breaking home run race.</TE>
<TE>   The owners want to fill their ballparks. The way to fill the
ballparks, apparently, is to promote players as bulked-up Hulk
Hogan-esque characters of mythical strength and superhuman powers.</TE>
<TE>   While the baseball fan is playing a new game--cruising through his
favorite team's roster and trying to guess which player is on
steroids (the one who gained 20 pounds of muscle in the off-season,
the one who is hitting dozens more homers at 38 than 28, the one with
the chiseled body and the annual month or so on the injured
list?)--owners sell their game by using comic book characters. Real
people aren't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   And the players, they want to hit 80 home runs, bat .390, strike
out hundreds of batters. Because that's what gets you paid. That's
what gets you on "SportsCenter," the 450-foot blast, the 99-mph
fastball, the newest, amazing-for-a-minute record. That's what causes
the fans to buy your shirts and call your name, helps you get
endorsements and accolades and the life so many professional athletes
believe they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   The players' agents, they want their clients to hit the 80 home
runs, bat .390, strike out hundreds of guys because the agent wants a
cut of the biggest possible deal.</TE>
<TE>   So the players, through their union and its chief, Donald Fehr,
are comfortable in making the issue of testing players for the use of
steroids nothing more than a bargaining chip in the ongoing labor
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   They seem willing to trade away a chance to clean up their game
and maybe save themselves a lifetime of health problems, or perhaps
an early death, for a bigger collective bargaining agreement. There
is no great force pushing for the elimination of steroids from the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Caminiti and Jose Canseco may be considered nothing more than
disgruntled, ungrateful ex-players trying to make a buck because they
can't cut it as athletes any more, but not many players or fans are
arguing loudly that their allegations of steroid use in baseball are
untrue.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly what has been heard since the two spoke out about, in
Caminiti's case, his own use of the drug and in Canseco's case, his
assertion that 85% of major league players use the drug, is that that
they are disloyal and have broken some sort of locker room code that
says what happens in the clubhouse stays in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   It would be nice to have some players who are frustrated and angry
seeing their game taken over in unnatural ways, players who will
never use steroids, who truly care about their own health and future,
stand up and demand drug testing now. It would be great to hear
someone other than Curt Schilling speak up, maybe even to say that
their sport needs accountability and that drug testing is not
something to be used as a bargaining chip.</TE>
<TE>   Players should not be content to have any part of their future
health held in the hands of Fehr or baseball Commissioner Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   But they are content, it seems. As are the fans. So we watch the
cartoon characters on TV and watch the cartoon game on the field.</TE>

<HD>Jones Helps Drive the Bandwagon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the player with the most national team appearances in U.S. soccer
history, Cobi Jones has run the gamut of emotions with the team.</LD>
<LD>   He saw the wave of interest in his sport crest and then crash
after the Americans hosted the World Cup in 1994 and unexpectedly
advanced to the second round.</LD>
<LD>   He also was there when the U.S. embarrassed itself in France in
1998 when it finished last while scoring one goal.</LD>
<TE>   This year's historic run to the quarterfinals has kick-started the
soccer bandwagon in this country again, and Jones, who played 158
games for the national team, is determined to keep the momentum
going, even if he has played in his last World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question we took a step back in '98 but we took two
steps forward in 2002," said a weary-looking Jones, who returned from
South Korea over the weekend and was beginning to feel the effects of
jetlag at Staples Center Thursday during a media luncheon.</TE>
<TE>   "To get soccer into the mainstream, and to keep it there, it's
going to take a lot of work by promoters, teams, agents. We can't let
it die. We've got to keep it on the minds of everybody."</TE>
<TE>   One way to do that, Jones said, is to continue to build
soccer-specific stadiums, such as the one utilized by the Columbus
Crew of Major League Soccer and the National Training Center under
construction in Carson that the Galaxy will call home next summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Another step," Jones said, "is higher visibility of MLS, more TV
time for MLS on newscasts. Show more than a goal being scored or the
final score. Show a great play ... a one-minute clip."</TE>
<TE>   Landon Donovan, 20, who scored two goals in the World Cup, said
the performance of the U.S. legitimized the American professional
league's standing.</TE>
<TE>   "It showed that players from MLS can perform on the world's
biggest stage," said Donovan, who plays for the San Jose Earthquakes.
"So hopefully we keep developing and in 2006 we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan, though, is sure to be highly sought after by more
prestigious European clubs. He was asked if he could become a true
global star by remaining in MLS and playing in World Cups every four
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it matters," he said. "To be respected you just
have to perform and play well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jones took issue with Mexico's downplaying the Americans' 2-0
elimination-game win.</TE>
<TE>   "They're screaming now that it was a fluke," Jones said. "The last
eight games, they've won one [in regulation], 1-0, at Azteca Stadium.
That's not a fluke, that's par for the course. People have to realize
that there's a changing of the guard at the top of CONCACAF."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Both Jones and Donovan expect Brazil to beat Germany--which ended
the United States' run, 1-0--in Sunday's World Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   "Brazil will go after them," Jones said. "Brazil has a good
defense and doesn't get enough credit for it. We get caught up in the
flair of their offense. They have a good defense too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy announced their intentions to go after a South Korean
player for next season.... Staples Center will show the World Cup's
third-place match between South Korea and Turkey on Saturday at 4
a.m. Tickets are free but must be picked up at the arena box office
beginning at 10 a.m. today. Doors open at 3 a.m.... A three-year
marketing partnership between the Galaxy and the California Youth
Soccer Assn.-South also was announced Thursday. The Galaxy and its
affiliated company, AEG Marketing, will assume the role of
CYSA-South's official agency, offering potential partners soccer
programming on the amateur and professional levels.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Survive Dry Spell to Beat Mystics</HD>
<DH>WNBA: L.A. doesn't score in seven-minute span in the second
half but hangs on for 73-69 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Washington Mystics may be the leaders of the Eastern Conference,
but they play Western Conference-style basketball, because they do
run, run, run, at every opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   But if the opponent plays your style better than you do, you
better have a Plan B.</LD>
<LD>   So when the Sparks were threatening to run the Mystics back to the
Beltway, Washington slowed the tempo--and nearly pulled off an upset.</LD>
<TE>   Only late free throws by Lisa Leslie and Tamecka Dixon, along with
a missed three-point attempt by Mystic guard Coco Miller in the last
five seconds, enabled the Sparks to hold off Washington, 73-69,
Thursday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Before 10,185 fans, the Sparks (11-1) survived a seven-minute
scoreless stretch late in the second half to extend their winning
streak to eight games and their home winning streak to 28 games.</TE>
<TE>   Mwadi Mabika had 20 points for the Sparks, including a
three-pointer with 1:09 to play. It was the Sparks' first basket
since a layup by DeLisha Milton at the 8:09 mark--a stretch in which
the Mystics took away the Sparks' running game and forced them to
take perimeter shots. During that time, Washington (10-3) had a 10-0
run to take a 69-66 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But those 68th and 69th points, courtesy of an eight-foot hook
shot by forward Chamique Holdsclaw, were the last ones Washington
would score.</TE>
<TE>   After Mabika tied the score, Leslie made two free throws. After a
timeout, Miller was free in the corner for the three-point attempt,
but the ball glanced off the rim.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon rebounded the errant shot, was fouled with less than a
second to play and made two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, led by Holdsclaw with 20, may have lost the game but
it gained a healthy dose of respect.</TE>
<TE>   "They have good composure and play good team ball," said Leslie,
who had 13 points and 14 rebounds. "But I thought we did a good job
tonight keeping our composure."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dixon, who scored 16: "They are legitimate. [Washington
Coach] Marianne Stanley knows how to get the most out of a player,
and she seems to be doing that."</TE>
<TE>   From the opening tap, the game was played at warp speed. But the
Mystics were slowed by poor shooting (14 of 38, 36.8%), especially
from the three-point line, where they made one of six attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks led by as many as 17 before settling for a 40-30
halftime lead. If they had shot better than 41% (15 of 37), they
might have put the game away in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to be more patient," Stanley said. "A couple of times
we took quick shots with no one in rebounding position, and the
Sparks were determined not to let us have good transition from the
offense to defense."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes into the second half, Washington had an 11-0 run to close
the gap to 50-49.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we learned something about ourselves tonight," Stanley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mystic center Vicky Bullett was blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "We found out we could play with them," Bullett said. "And I hope
we see them again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA games, Penny Taylor emerged from a shooting slump to
score 24 points and lead the Cleveland Rockers to 73-50 victory over
the Sacramento Monarchs before 8,521 fans at Cleveland.... Michelle
Marciniak made a running seven-foot shot with less than one second
left to give the Seattle Storm a 73-71 victory over the Orlando
Miracle before 4,718 fans at Seattle.</TE>

<HD>Indians Deal Colon to Expos</HD>
<DH>Baseball: In what could be its last season, Montreal gears
up for playoff race by acquiring Cleveland ace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>The Cleveland Indians figured they had no chance to win this season,
even with ace Bartolo Colon. For the Montreal Expos, this might be
their last chance.</LD>
<LD>   The disappointing Indians traded Colon to the surprising Expos for
first baseman Lee Stevens and top prospect Brandon Phillips in a
six-player deal Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Cleveland sent Colon and a player to be named--said to be minor
league pitcher Tim Drew--and cash to the Expos for Stevens and three
prospects: pitcher Cliff Lee, outfielder Grady Sizemore and Phillips,
a shortstop.</LD>
<TE>   "I hope it sends a message to our fans and players that we are
trying to be competitive and trying to make the playoffs," Expo
General Manager Omar Minaya said.</TE>
<TE>   Colon is 10-4 with a 2.55 earned-run average in 16 starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians, who had great expectations after starting the season
11-1, have faded ever since in the American League Central.</TE>
<TE>   They are 36-41 and in third place, seven games behind Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big blow to us, a shock," said C.C. Sabathia, now the
Indians' top pitcher. "Bartolo was certainly the best pitcher on the
staff. He carried the load for this team."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, who escaped baseball's plan to eliminate them in the
off-season, have been one of the majors' best success stories this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a team thrown together in spring training, the Expos are
41-36 and in the middle of the NL wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Mark Shapiro said the deal signals a new phase for
the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   "This very clearly and very definitively demonstrates that we are
moving into a formal rebuilding process with players that we all feel
are going to be here in the '04 and '05 seasons which are when we
feel we can start to emerge as a contender again," he said.</TE>

<HD>NBC Should Fault Wimbledon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This isn't the way NBC was hoping things would turn out at Wimbledon.
The women's field lacked depth going in, and now the men's field has
been depleted.</LD>
<LD>   NBC was dealt a big blow when Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi were
eliminated Wednesday. The network is left trying to hype Andy
Roddick, the 11th-seeded player, or maybe Jeff Morrison, to its
American audience.</LD>
<LD>   Morrison, a former collegiate champion at Florida who is ranked
No. 98 in the world, upset ninth-seeded Juan Carlos Ferrero Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "If there was any question about the men's draw being pretty wide
open, I think that's been answered," NBC commentator John McEnroe
said during a conference call with reporters after Sampras and Agassi
lost. "The good news is, we've got some guys now believing they can
win it."</TE>
<TE>   That's McEnroe, always looking for a silver lining.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, commentator Chris Evert didn't sugarcoat things on the
women's side.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the men's, it has been pretty uneventful on the women's
side," she said. "I think it's a three-way race between the Williams
sisters [Venus and Serena] and Jennifer Capriati. Those three are the
only ones who have a shot. My pick is Venus."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing there to get too excited about, nor warrant the kind of
coverage NBC is committed to next week. There's also continued
coverage on TNT and sister channel CNNfn, which came into the mix
after CNN-SI shut down last month. CNNfn, which reaches only 19
million homes, offers nightly highlights at 6.</TE>
<TE>   NBC will have delayed coverage every day through the finals, plus
a late-night highlights show that will run from 11:35 to 11:50 p.m.
Monday through Thursday and 11:35 p.m. to 12:05 a.m. a week from
today.</TE>
<TE>   You can imagine how thrilled Jay Leno is to have part of his show
preempted for what has become a dud of a tournament.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe will host the late-night highlight shows. Maybe to spice
things up, NBC could invite Tatum O'Neal to join him.</TE>
<TE>   Local Moves</TE>
<TE>   Channel 4 has told Carlos Del Valle his contract will not be
renewed, which comes as a surprise. The affable Del Valle seemed to
be doing a fine job. He'll be replaced, at least for the time being,
by Mario Solis, who has been working as the station's No. 3
sportscaster. Exactly when Del Valle will be leaving is not known,
but his contract expires in August.</TE>
<TE>   Still no word on a replacement for Bill Weir, who said months ago
he would be leaving Channel 7 sometime before his contract expires in
September to pursue opportunities outside sports. But Rod Fukuzaki,
the station's No. 2 sportscaster, has already been told he will
replace Weir as the host of "Monday Night Live."</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net has hired Carolyn Hughes as a reporter and anchor
for "Southern California Sports Report." Hughes comes from the ABC
affiliate in El Paso, where she was the host of a popular morning
show and was a weekend sports anchor before that.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Gould is the new weekend sportscaster at Channel 11,
having replaced Randy Kerdoon. The USC graduate comes from San Diego,
and she worked in Miami before that. However, her background is in
news, not sports.</TE>
<TE>   Buck's Replacement</TE>
<TE>   Before the baseball season, Joel Meyers was asked to fill in for
Jack Buck on St. Louis Cardinal road broadcasts and maybe do a few
home games too. But with Buck's health continuing to fail, Meyers
ended up doing all the Cardinal radio broadcasts with Mike Shannon.
After the death of Buck last week, Meyers will continue in that role
through at least the end of this season.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers, originally from St. Louis, has lived in Southern
California for 20 years. He said he's not sure what the future holds.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm just worried about this season," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers also does Sunday night football for CBS Radio/Westwood One
and San Antonio Spur telecasts for Fox Sports Net Southwest. He has
also been mentioned as a candidate to replace Chick Hearn whenever he
retires.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sunderland is the front-runner, but the Lakers are going to
have to hire two play-by-play announcers when Hearn retires--one for
TV, one for radio. There will be no more simulcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Charity Department</TE>
<TE>   The 36th Victor Awards, a live television event in the past, will
be tape-delayed this weekend. The event, which benefits the City of
Hope Cancer Center, will be held Saturday night at the Las Vegas
Hilton and televised Sunday from 6-8 p.m. by Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   Among the honorees will be Terry Bradshaw, the annual Victor
Awards Hall of Fame inductee, and Dick Enberg, who will be presented
the Walton Payton "Sweetness" Award by Fox Sports Net's Chris Myers.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Enberg was in New York to serve as the host of the
Academic Hall of Fame ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 2's Jim Hill will again serve as master of ceremonies for
the 17th Cedar-Sinai Sports Spectacular Sunday night at the Century
Plaza Hotel. The dinner helps raise money for children with genetic
birth defects, a cause Hill has donated a lot of his time to. Among
other things, he was master of ceremonies when a new center at
Cedars-Sinai was dedicated in December.</TE>
<TE>   The Sports Spectacular has raised about $12 million, including $1
million last year. Barry Bonds, Kobe Bryant and Lisa Leslie will be
among the honorees this year.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Give Channel 7 credit. It will show ABC's coverage of the World
Cup championship game live Sunday at 4 a.m. And for the real
diehards, ABC's pregame show with Terry Gannon and Giorgio Chinaglia
starts at 3:30 a.m. Univision's pregame show starts a half-hour
before that.... The third-place game, on Univision live at 4 a.m.
Saturday, will be shown tape-delayed at 3 p.m. Saturday by ABC.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, baseball will have an All-Star selection show.
ESPN will televise it Sunday at 4 p.m., followed at 5 p.m. by the New
York Mets and Yankees.... ESPN, which said goodbye to "Unscripted" on
Tuesday after a run of only eight months, has a new show, "Sports
Reporters II," making its debut Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. Jack Ford, who
has anchored ABC's "20/20" and hosted "Good Morning America," will be
the show's moderator. The first panel will be made up of NBC's Jim
Gray, Yankee commentator Michael Kay and Dan Le Batard of the Miami
Herald and ESPN Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing beat: Last weekend's pay-per-view fight between Marco
Antonio Barrero and Erik Morales will be part of the HBO's "Boxing
After Dark" show Saturday at 9:45 p.m. Featured is a heavyweight
fight between Wladimir Klitschko and Ray Mercer.... Saturday night at
8, Channel 9 is offering another card from the Arrowhead Pond. This
one features Julio Gonzalez taking on Jonathan Young.</TE>
<TE>   Not recommended for children: Tonight's edition of "Best Damn
Sports Show Period" on Fox Sports Net will feature taped highlights
of a bachelor party/roast for Tom Arnold.</TE>
<TE>   Included is the appearance of a Roseanne impersonator, spoofing
his first wife.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold is getting married for a third time Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   TNT's Ernie Johnson turned in an impressive performance this week.
He flew on the Concorde from London, arriving in New York at 9:30
a.m., served as the host of Wednesday's NBA draft coverage, then
headed back to London on the Concorde shortly after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Johnson was all class as TNT ended an 18-year run of
covering the NBA draft, saying, "Our friends at ESPN will take over
next year, and I know they'll do a fine job."</TE>
<TE>   But it won't be the same without Charles Barkley.</TE>

<LD>World Cup championships are nothing new to Brazil and Germany, who
have combined to win seven of the last 12. The highlights:</LD>
<LD>   SWITZERLAND 1954</LD>
<LD>   West Germany</LD>
<TE>   The West Germans entered the final as one of the greatest
underdogs of all time, facing the Hungarians, who had already
defeated them, 8-3, in group play. But this was the game on which
Germany's reputation for battling through under any circumstances was
built. Hungary led, 2-0, after only eight minutes, but the Germans
had equalized by the 19th minute. Five minutes from overtime, Helmut
Rahn scored the winner. The German captain, Fritz Walter, died 11
days ago, possible inspiration for this year's German team.</TE>
<TE>   SWEDEN 1958</TE>
<TE>   Brazil</TE>
<TE>   In its last game of group play, Brazil introduced the world to
future greatness, as 17-year-old Pele made his first appearance, in a
2-0 victory over the Soviet Union. He didn't score that day, but had
the lone goal in a quarterfinal victory over Wales, scored a hat
trick in the semifinals against France and added two more goals in
the final, including a 90th-minute score to close out a 5-2 victory
over Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   CHILE 1962</TE>
<TE>   Brazil</TE>
<TE>   If 1958 belonged to Pele, 1962 belonged to Garrincha. A short,
bandy-legged winger whose nickname meant "The Little Bird," he had
only made the national team four years before at the insistence of
his teammates, who didn't share the reservations of the coaching
staff over his irreverent personality. In Sweden, his crosses from
the right side provided goals for Pele and Vava. In 1962, with Pele
injured during the first round, he added goal-scoring to his arsenal.
He scored twice in both the quarterfinals and semifinals, before
Brazil put away Czechoslovakia, 3-1, in the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   MEXICO 1970</TE>
<TE>   Brazil</TE>
<TE>   Brazil left England in 1966 after first-round elimination,
complaining of rough treatment by the European teams. But if anyone
thought the dynasty was at an end, the 1970 team proved them wrong.
Scoring 19 goals in six games, it romped through a strong field, led
by Pele and Jairzinho. A goal by Gerson in the 66th minute of the
final broke a 1-1 tie, on the way to a 4-1 victory over Italy.</TE>
<TE>   WEST GERMANY 1974</TE>
<TE>   West Germany</TE>
<TE>   The situation was similar to that of 20 years before. The West
Germans suffered an embarrassing first-round loss, this one 1-0 to
East Germany, and found itself in the final against an overwhelming
favorite. The Netherlands, known for its proficiency in the fluid
style of Total Football, showed its skills by holding possession of
the ball for the game's first two minutes, gaining a penalty kick
after an exhibition of precision passing and taking a 1-0 lead. But
West Germany gave the home fans what they came for, tying the score
in the 25th minute on Paul Breitner's penalty kick, taking the lead
two minutes from the half on Gerd Muller's goal, then holding on for
the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Italy 1990</TE>
<TE>   West Germany</TE>
<TE>   In a tournament in which teams didn't so much advance as survive,
it was perhaps fitting that the hard-working Germans would win. Their
opponent, Argentina, was playing with four starters out because of an
accumulation of yellow cards, and the game appeared headed to penalty
kicks, as had both semifinals. In the 84th minute, however, Rudi
Voeller, Germany's high-scoring forward and coach of the current
German team, was taken down in the penalty area, and Andreas Brehme
converted the kick for a 1-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   USA 1994</TE>
<TE>   Brazil</TE>
<TE>   The fears of soccer purists finally came true when a World Cup
final was decided by penalty kicks, but Brazil earned its
championship with a tournament-long run of strong play and the
scoring of Romario and Bebeto. After outlasting the Netherlands, 3-2,
in a quarterfinal game that may have been the best match of the
tournament, and nipping Sweden, 1-0, the Brazilians played Italy to a
0-0 tie in intense heat at the Rose Bowl. The shootout is best
remembered for Roberto Baggio, whose scoring had led Italy into the
final, shooting over the bar on the final kick of the game.</TE>

<HD>Henman Satisfies Home Fans, for Now</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: As pressure from compatriots mounts, he beats
Draper in four sets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>One man's loss, well, make that three men--Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi
and Marat Safin--can be taken as a gain for another very English man.
A questionable gain, though, as they were far away from fourth-seeded
Tim Henman in the Wimbledon draw, clear over on the other side.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras, Agassi and Safin would have been a problem for Henman
only in the final. Henman has never played in the Wimbledon final,
having reached the semifinals three times. If form holds, No. 1
Lleyton Hewitt of Australia could be his semifinal opponent.</LD>
<LD>   That doesn't matter for the moment. Since England was ousted from
the World Cup, they're taking the good news where they can get it.
The tabloids viewed Wednesday's departures of Sampras, Agassi and
Safin as a huge boost for Our Tim. Good news cut the other way,
however.</LD>
<TE>   The Daily Mirror ran pictures of the three ousted players in
Thursday's editions, all looking suitably grim, and a picture of a
smiling Henman with this headline: "No pressure Timbo, but choke now
and we'll never forgive you."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Sun, splitting the pressure between Henman and
countryman Greg Rusedski: "Out Out Out. Tim, Greg ... if you can't
win it now, you never will...."</TE>
<TE>   Henmania was the theme on Day 4, ruling Centre Court during his
tense 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 second-round victory over Australian Scott
Draper. It spread through the grounds, most visibly on Henman Hill, a
spot for a little more than a thousand spectators who could monitor
his movements on the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   The sound apparently could be heard over on Court 1 during No. 16
Nicolas Escude of France's 6-2, 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 second-round win over
Marc Rosset of Switzerland. Rosset teased Henman about Henman Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "He was blaming me to a certain extent, saying there was so much
noise he couldn't concentrate," Henman said. "Hopefully, the name is
going to stick, Henman Hill."</TE>
<TE>   He viewed it as quite extraordinary to have something named after
him at Wimbledon because it was "for a guy who has been coming here
since he was 5."</TE>
<TE>   After losing the first set, a nervous Henman felt the tension from
the fans, fearing another upset after the tumultuous turn of events
at Wimbledon. Wimbledon 2002 has hardly been ordinary through the
first four days. Consider this statistic: There are two lucky losers
remaining, American Jeff Morrison and George Bastl of Switzerland,
and only three of the top 10 seeded players, Hewitt, Henman and
fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison was responsible for the elimination of another top
player, defeating No. 9 and French Open finalist Juan Carlos Ferrero
of Spain, 6-3, 7-5, 7-6 (5), fighting off two set points in the
third. Feliciano Lopez of Spain beat No. 10 Guillermo Canas of
Argentina, 4-6, 2-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5, 10-8, fighting off six match
points.</TE>
<TE>   What helped Henman survive, in part, was the little extra help
from his supporters. Last year, he said, was the first time he used
their backing, showing more emotion and fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just experience," he said. "I know how advantageous,
how positive they can be. And I'm going to use everything I can."</TE>
<TE>   But he wasn't about to declare the departures of Safin, Sampras
and Agassi as an advantage, realizing that would be premature and
inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "Which half of the draw was playing [Wednesday]?" he asked,
smiling. "Is that my half? There's a lot of experts out there. A
large majority of the experts, I haven't paid a great deal of
attention to it. I think that's enough said, really, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   Upsets, though fewer, were not limited to the men. No. 5 Kim
Clijsters of Belgium continued her slide, which has been caused, in
part, by injuries to her shoulder and upper right arm. A French Open
finalist last year, she lost in the third round at Roland Garros to
Clarisa Fernandez of Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Here, Elena Likhovtseva of Russia defeated Clijsters, 7-6 (5),
6-2, in the second round, and will next face something of a rarity in
the third round ... a British woman.</TE>
<TE>   Wild card Elena Baltacha of Britain defeated No. 32 Amanda Coetzer
of South Africa, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, and showed some fire on the court
behind her glasses and an independent spirit off it. She wore a shirt
into the interview room with a slogan of the company French
Connection, which can't fully be described in this newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "Still hasn't hit me yet," she said, looking shocked by the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The tabloid reporters were more interested that she tossed her
racket than the fact this was the third time in 13 years that a
British woman reached the third round at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I'm not an aggressive person or anything," she said. "I
don't go around beating people up or anything. It was just that
moment, I just threw my racket. It happens."</TE>
<TE>   The 18-year-old has an impressive sports lineage. Her father,
Sergei, was a soccer player, having represented the former Soviet
Union and had turns at Ipswich Town and in Scotland. Her mother,
Olga, was a pentathlete and brother Sergei is a member of the
Scottish under-21 soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably grass is my favorite surface, but I still need to win
matches on hard [court] and clay," she said. "I'm still working
bloody hard on that."</TE>
<TE>   Like Henman, she was thrilled by the crowd support. "People were
going bananas," Baltacha said. "It was brilliant. My hair was
standing up on the back of my neck."</TE>

<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>He could be working for his father in Huntington, W.Va., checking out
the pipes in the family's waste, water and sewage treatment business.</LD>
<LD>   All things considered, Jeff Morrison would rather be at Wimbledon.
Giving new meaning to the phrase "lucky loser," Morrison grabbed the
spotlight Thursday with an electric, energetic performance in his
first appearance on Centre Court, defeating ninth-seeded Juan Carlos
Ferrero of Spain, 6-3, 7-5, 7-6 (5). He had never won a Grand Slam
match before this tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are out of Wimbledon. Morrison, who
lost in qualifying but got in when Tommy Haas withdrew, will play No.
18 Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands in the third round Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Morrison, 23, served and volleyed with ease, showing great comfort
and touch on grass. He also displayed a sense of humor, laughing and
leaning on the net when he missed a relatively easy overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night when I found out [about Centre Court], I was excited,"
said Morrison, the 1999 NCAA champion from Florida. "This morning I
woke up and I was a nervous wreck."</TE>
<TE>   Morrison heard a few shouts of support, using his nickname "Ship."
It was given to him when he was in high school in West Virginia, not
exactly a tennis hotbed, before he left for an academy at
Spartanburg, S.C. A spectator yelled out during one of his matches
that he was like a battleship because of his fighting spirit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fed Cup captain Billie Jean King spoke about her dispute with
Jennifer Capriati, the events leading up to King's kicking Capriati
off the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to make it very clear that I asked for closed
practice and they would not stick with it," King said of Capriati and
her coach. "Also I think you need to know that twice she left the
team on the Sunday before the week and on the Wednesday and she kept
breaking rules all the time.</TE>
<TE>   " ... [The] media has not quite understood that I did not want her
not to go practice some more. That was not the issue at all. The
issue was that the [individual] coaches could not practice with the
players because it's a team event that week and I can't have four
coaches and four players on the court."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Martina Navratilova returned to Centre Court and won her
first-round doubles match with Natasha Zvereva. She inspired
admiration with her recent singles victory at Eastbourne at age 45.</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova would most certainly be given a wild card at Wimbledon
if she wanted a spot. She said she wouldn't just for the sake of
novelty. There is also the issue of her TV commentating schedule.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea of Navratilova playing singles at Wimbledon has been
an issue in the tennis world and among her fans, who were excited by
her form and showing at Eastbourne.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows?" she said. "I'm not ruling anything out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Security became an issue when two fans got on Centre Court and
started playing after Monica Seles' victory. Seles was gone before
the intruders took the court.</TE>
<TE>   The men were taken away by security and apparently left the club
before further questioning. All England Club officials, bothered by
the lapse, released this statement:</TE>
<TE>   "We are treating this matter very seriously. It was extremely
irresponsible. We will be reviewing our security procedures."</TE>
<TE>   Serena Williams has a very visible personal security guard who was
also with her at the French Open, following a recent episode
involving an overzealous fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I think more than ever you have to be, these days, very careful
of what you do and where you go and what time you do it and if you do
it alone or with someone else," said her sister Venus Williams. "And
you have to be very conscious about who's looking at you."</TE>

<TE>Saturday, 4 a.m. PDT, at Daegu, South Korea
TV: Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 46, 10 a.m.; Ch. 7, 3 p.m.; Galavision, 7:30
p.m
How they got here: South Korea (3-1-2) lost, 1-0, to Germany in the
semifinals; Turkey (3-2-1) lost, 1-0, to Brazil in the semifinals
South Korea update: This is the farewell game for Dutch Coach Guus
Hiddink, who along with his team next week will be awarded the
Cheongryong (Blue Dragon) award, the country's highest sporting
honor, for reaching the semifinals. Hiddink steps down as South
Korea's coach and is expected to join PSV Eindhoven of the Dutch
league. He wants to go out a winner, if only to repay the millions of
South Korea's fans for their support
Turkey update: In one of the more memorable lines delivered during
the World Cup, Turkey Coach Senol Gunes said he is looking forward to
the 2006 tournament because "here we were guests, but in Germany we
will be one of the hosts." Turkey, which has hundreds of thousands of
migrant workers in Germany, has reason to be optimistic. Its
performance at Korea/Japan '02 surpassed all expectations, with
players such as forwards Hasan Sas and Ilhan Mansiz, midfielders Emre
Belozoglu and Umit Davala and goalkeeper Rustu Recber in particular
catching the eye. "After this, the whole world will be looking at
Turkish football and Turkish people differently," Sas predicted
Sidelined: South Korea forward Hwang Sun-Hong (thigh) and defender
Choi Jin-Cheul (ankle) are injured and doubtful starters. Turkey's
Sas is suspended after getting a second yellow card against Brazil
Outlook: The teams played to a 0-0 tie in a friendly in March. "It
will be a fun match," Turkey's Mansiz said. "We know their strengths
and weaknesses." Both teams will attack at speed, and Recber's
goalkeeping could prove the difference. Prediction: Turkey, 2-1</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Egyptian soccer officials criticized FIFA on Thursday for excluding
their referee Gamal el-Ghandour from officiating the World Cup final
between Germany and Brazil, claiming he is a victim of politics.</LD>
<LD>   The final match Sunday will be officiated by Italian referee
Pierluigi Collina, and Saad Kamil from Kuwait will officiate the
third-place game between South Korea and Turkey on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   El-Ghandour came under criticism from Spanish media and soccer
officials after Spain's loss to co-host South Korea in the
quarterfinals.</LD>
<TE>   Former Egypt star Taher Abu Zeid said El-Ghandour was made a
scapegoat for politics inside the world soccer ruling body.</TE>
<TE>   "FIFA was affected by the Spanish accusation and criticism after
the match and, therefore, it couldn't take the decision to appoint
el-Ghandour for another match," Abu Zeid said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FIFA President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter ruled out the use of video
replays or other technical help for referees at the next World Cup
despite a flurry of protests over disputed calls during the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "If our game is becoming scientific then we will take away its
emotion and nobody would have any discussion any longer if it was
offside, not offside; if it was inside, not inside the penalty box,"
he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With only two games left, no doping cases have been reported,
FIFA's medical chief said.</TE>
<TE>   "All 248 samples have been negative, including those of the two
semifinals," said Michel D'Hooghe, the chairman of FIFA's medical
committee.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Theater Scene's 'Moses' Will Bow Out</HD>
<DH>Arts: Gordon Davidson's long Ahmanson and Taper tenure
netted respect, awards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS and DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gordon Davidson, a shrewd showman from Brooklyn who grabbed the reins
of Southern California's theater community amid the tumult of the
late 1960s, then stayed to guide the Mark Taper Forum to national
prominence and take over the Ahmanson Theatre, will step down from
his top job at the Center Theatre Group in 2 1/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   That move, to be announced today, signals the close of an era of
profound change in American theater. While Davidson, 69, was building
his organization into a cultural force and voice for diversity in Los
Angeles, he was also marching at the forefront of a regional theater
movement that broke New York's virtual monopoly on serious theater in
America.</LD>
<LD>   If the transition goes according to plan, his successor will
inherit an enterprise with 65,000 subscribers; an annual budget of
more than $40 million; a new third stage to complement the Taper and
Ahmanson; and a legacy of inclusive programming that has given voice
to Latinos with 1978's "Zoot Suit," the deaf with 1979's "Children of
a Lesser God," gays with 1992's "Angels in America," and Asian
Americans with last year's reworking of "Flower Drum Song."</LD>
<TE>   Davidson, who sidestepped the word "retirement," called the
decision "a moment in which we acknowledge a change is going to
happen." He stressed that "I've still got 2 1/2 years to run this
theater. Then we can stop and evaluate what's good and what's bad."</TE>
<TE>   Davidson and Richard Kagan, president of the CTG board, said they
hammered out details at a private meeting May 26. A transition
committee will be formed within the next month, Kagan said, and an
executive-search firm will be hired shortly thereafter. Current
staffers, including Taper Producing Director Robert Egan and
Associate Artistic Director Corey Madden, will be among those
considered in an international search, Kagan said.</TE>
<TE>   For the theater community, Davidson's disclosure means that for
the first time in 35 years, theatrical life in Los Angeles may not be
dominated by the silver-haired impresario whom Time magazine once
labeled "the reigning godfather of the American regional theater
movement." That prospect cheers some critics, who suggest that as his
reign lengthened, Davidson didn't cultivate enough creativity in his
own backyard and worried too much about exporting shows to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the Moses of theater in Los Angeles. Now, is he still the
Moses? No. Now we have a lot of active theaters, and each theater has
its own voice. Now there are a lot of people here," said Gil Cates, a
friend and producing director at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Citing Davidson's sense of history and respect for the spoken
word, Cates said Davidson "made a national presence not only for
himself, but for Los Angeles theater. That's the best part of it. The
question now is: Where do we go from here?"</TE>
<TE>   Davidson has served as artistic director at the 745-seat Mark
Taper Forum since it opened in 1967, and since 1989 has also handled
duties as artistic director-producer at the 2,100-seat Ahmanson
Theatre. He has staged premieres of work from many of the country's
most celebrated playwrights, including Tony Kushner, Anna Deavere
Smith, George C. Wolfe and Jon Robin Baitz, and sent more than 35
productions to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Davidson became one of the highest-paid arts
administrators in the U.S.--drawing $337,000 yearly, according to the
CTG's 2000 tax filings.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, Davidson's productions have earned 18 Tony Awards
and three Pulitzers, including back-to-back Pulitzers in 1992 and
1993 for Robert Schenkkan's "The Kentucky Cycle" and the first
installment of Kushner's "Angels in America." The Pulitzers were the
first awarded to plays produced outside New York.</TE>
<TE>   But Davidson's greatest achievement, former associate artistic
director Oskar Eustis suggested, may be simply that "he has managed
to make serious theater in the eye of the celebrity hurricane."</TE>
<TE>   Eustis, who worked as associate artistic director for Davidson
from 1989 to 1994 before becoming artistic director of the Trinity
Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., said, "What Gordon has done
consistently is stand for the idea that a serious American theater
has to be a theater of inclusion, and that we have to bring everybody
into the tent."</TE>
<TE>   Eustis added: "He's gone out of fashion, and I hope very much that
it's an ethos that's coming back into fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Taper and Ahmanson theaters both belong to the Center
Theatre Group and are neighbors in downtown's Music Center, they
follow different missions.</TE>
<TE>   The Ahmanson has served most often as presenter of road
productions born elsewhere. The Taper has built a reputation for
nurturing new works and sending promising shows to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement with the CTG board of directors, Davidson will
retain his dual titles through Dec. 31, 2004, then serve as
consultant for three years. That timing, Davidson said, will allow
him to see through the $11-million effort to renovate and open the
new 325-seat Kirk Douglas Theater in a converted 1947 Culver City
movie house.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson's successor--or successors, if the Taper and Ahmanson
jobs are again divided--will be expected to take over programming
beginning with the 2005-06 season.</TE>
<TE>   "Five or six years ago, I began to think maybe I should begin to
figure out when is the appropriate time to let go," Davidson said.
His 70th birthday on May 7, 2003, seemed a logical answer. But as the
prospects improved for adding another venue to the company's
operation, he and board members resolved instead that he would stay
on another 18 months to reach that opening date.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson, born in Brooklyn to a theater professor father and
pianist mother, took his first theater job in the 1950s as an
apprentice stage manager at the American Shakespeare Festival in New
York, where he met director John Houseman.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson had just moved from stage managing to directing in 1964
when he was recruited by Houseman to join the artistic leadership of
the 6-year-old Theatre Group at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, the Music Center's most powerful booster,
Dorothy Chandler, wife of former Los Angeles Times publisher Norman
Chandler, invited the group to take up residence at the Taper and
tapped Davidson to serve as artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no plan. I had to make it up, and sell it, and do it,"
Davidson recalled, sitting in his corner office at the Taper Annex
amid memorabilia from productions spanning four decades.</TE>
<TE>   In the '50s and '60s, many institutions that made up America's
first wave of resident theaters emphasized classical repertory, with
ongoing companies of actors.</TE>
<TE>   But Davidson found himself running a theater in a city where
lucrative jobs in movies and TV prevent many actors from making the
long-term stage commitments required of classical repertory. So the
Taper began focusing on plays that were new, or at least new to the
area.</TE>
<TE>   The first Taper season in 1967 started with "The Devils" by John
Whiting. The city's archbishop denounced the production, which
concerned the tale of a libertine priest, a nun and their sexual
fantasies. The season was made up of two world premieres and two West
Coast premieres.</TE>
<TE>   Succeeding seasons sprinkled in more classics, but the company's
reputation stemmed from new plays that often bristled with social or
political commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the institution won audiences, prizes and national
attention, however, Davidson's critics complained that he was
continually glancing to the East Coast in his programming decisions,
or overlooking Southern California talent, or choosing works more
politically correct than politically challenging.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gordon Davidsons of this world are making the American
theater very uninteresting to someone like me," said Justin Tanner,
who spent most of the 1990s as an L.A. playwright and now writes for
television but never was produced at the Taper. "It's all polished
and it looks gorgeous, but all the art has been drained out of it.
It's so safe. To me, theater was supposed to be where you could say
what you couldn't say on television or film."</TE>
<TE>   Davidson said it's up to others to judge his work, but for him the
joy in this job has been that "you come together, actors and
audience, and you tell a story to each other. It's the campfire. It's
meant to be experienced at that moment, for that moment."</TE>

<DH>A deadly fire prompts China's latest crackdown on seedy
i-cafes filled with game-obsessed players. 'You can't stop us,' one
youth says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>At first, Song Yozhu thought that his 14-year-old grandson was on
drugs. The boy rarely came home. When he did show up, he was
lethargic. Then, a few weeks ago, he and a 13-year-old friend
bleached their hair blond and started living together in an empty
apartment.</LD>
<LD>   "He told me, no, he was not on drugs," Song said. "He had been
hanging out at the wang ba. He said he went there almost every
night."</LD>
<LD>   Wang bas are China's 200,000 Internet cafes, the vast majority of
them illegal. To the West, they may appear to raise the prospect of
free expression in a country with an authoritarian regime, but to
Chinese parents, they are smoke-filled rooms with substandard safety
conditions, nothing more than modern-day versions of opium dens
ruining their children's lives.</LD>
<TE>   And, in some cases, taking their children's lives.</TE>
<TE>   This month, 25 people, many of them teenagers, were killed in a
blaze at a Beijing wang ba. Chillingly, it was no accident. Song's
grandson and his friend have confessed to setting the fire, allegedly
as revenge against the owners, who had refused to let them in.</TE>
<TE>   The government immediately shut down every wang ba in the capital,
and Chinese parents cheered. Large cities across China took similar
action.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very happy the government closed all the Internet cafes at
the moment," said Lu Mei, who said his 16-year-old son was forced to
repeat a year of high school because he spent too much time at the
cafes. "He used to lie to me about where he was going. I thought he
was studying at school, yet he was playing games at the Internet
cafe. I was so angry, I didn't know what to do. I couldn't follow him
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Wang ba translates as "Net bar." But the majority of them qualify
neither as cafes nor bars. You won't find espresso machines or beer
on tap. You will, however, see plenty of ashtrays and breathe in lots
of smoke. Some facilities are so primitive, the only bathroom is a
bucket against a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Like those at the wang ba that burned, most owners skirt the law,
operating without a license and serving minors. China permits people
younger than 18 to patronize licensed wang bas on weekends and
holidays. Those younger than 14 can enter only with an adult.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Beijing is responsible for promoting illicit wang bas.
The Communist government is so afraid of the Internet's power to
spread antisocial activities, it has tried to control Internet cafes
by making it nearly impossible to get a license. Instead, the move
has had the opposite effect.</TE>
<TE>   The illegal market has flourished, with fewer safety precautions.
Periodic crackdowns such as the one underway have only made the cafes
more popular.</TE>
<TE>   As much as the government is wary of the Internet, it also
understands the Web's economic and social benefits. For example,
Beijing wants to be known as a digital city for the 2008 Olympics.
That won't be possible if the authorities unplug all the Internet
cafes.</TE>
<TE>   The state-owned telecommunications sector also has tremendous
financial interest in promoting the use of the Internet. The question
Beijing is wrestling with is how best to control the phenomenon
without killing it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine they would want to crack down on a permanent
basis," said Dali Yang, a China specialist at the University of
Chicago. "No sane Chinese leader would want to say that. This is not
an absolute issue of Internet freedom but how to best regulate the
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the government wanted a total ban, physically it wouldn't
be possible. The wang bas pop up easily: All you need is a few
computers and a room and you're in business.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this month's fire has become a rallying point for worried
parents long eager to stamp out the illegal cafes and rein in the
country's out-of-control cyber kids.</TE>
<TE>   Blame what is happening on two decades of dramatic social change.
China went from being a nearly computer-illiterate nation a few years
ago to one with 33 million Internet users.</TE>
<TE>   That might seem puny compared with the 143 million signing on in
the United States. But China's numbers are growing exponentially and
are expected to reach 100 million by mid-decade. The country soon
could boast the biggest online population on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The more open society of modern China has brought not only
unprecedented personal freedom but also an explosion in juvenile
crime.</TE>
<TE>   In a country that not long ago was filled with young Communists so
morally upright that they would turn a penny found on the street over
to police, juvenile delinquents now regularly make the news,
mirroring their naughty counterparts in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to what some Westerners--and members of the Chinese
Communist Party--might expect, many young Chinese Web surfers show
only minimal interest in the Internet as a tool for information
gathering or political subversion. Like youngsters around the globe,
what they really crave is computer games. Lots of computer games.</TE>
<TE>   To them, wang bas function as a giant video arcade. At the cafe
that burned, for example, players paid less than $2 a night for all
the games they wanted. Even those who have their own terminals find
the cafes cheaper, faster and infinitely more fun than signing on
from home or school, where parents and teachers may be around to
supervise.</TE>
<TE>   This is a generation of spoiled only children--"little emperors,"
as they're often called. They grew up in a society without devotion
to God, Mao or sometimes even their parents. The online world of
violent games serves as a kind of surrogate faith for many.</TE>
<TE>   Some seem to delight in their addiction.</TE>
<TE>   At Beijing Science and Technology University, which reportedly
lost nine students in the blaze, it was standing room only last week
in one undergraduate computer room, which is still open because it is
part of the school's academic facility, not a wang ba.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of the 100 or so students there were male, and
virtually all the on-screen activities were games.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere was so charged, it felt like an actual combat zone,
with players linking up in online squads and firing away as if their
lives depended on it.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't play for one day, I can't concentrate on anything,"
said Liang Sai, a 19-year-old chemistry major waiting for a terminal.
"If you ban all the Internet cafes, we'll find somewhere else to
play. You can't stop us, because we're hooked."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the two boys accused of setting the deadly fire, the wang ba
was practically their second home.</TE>
<TE>   Both Song's grandson, who because of his age has been identified
only by his last name, Song, and his accomplice, identified as Zhang,
have drug-addicted fathers now in jail, said the grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   These aren't spoiled children. Song's parents divorced before he
was a year old. He hasn't seen his mother since he was 7. He grew up
with his father, who had a string of girlfriends. Some of them used
to beat the boy, his grandfather said.</TE>
<TE>   The grandparents once found the boy, then 2, waiting for his
father on a trash pile, chewing on rotten fruit. Early this year,
when his father went to jail, the boy went to live with his
grandfather, a 67-year-old widower who uses a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang basically lived on his own in his mother's bare apartment.
She was never around. A few weeks ago, young Song moved in with him,
hauling over the TV, refrigerator and washer from his father's house.
They smoked cigarettes and literally played with fire, twice almost
burning down the apartment, the grandfather said.</TE>
<TE>   The grandson pretended to go to school, but classmates said they
rarely saw him. When he did show up, he behaved like a bully,
borrowing money he never returned so he could head back to the
Internet cafe.</TE>
<TE>   "He has suffered too much pain. He's not afraid of anything," the
older Song said.</TE>
<TE>   What the boy needed, it seemed, was hope. Sometime last year, his
mother called his grandfather to say that if he did well in school,
she would find a way to take him to the United States. The thought
that his mother still cared seemed enough to transform the delinquent
into an angel.</TE>
<TE>   "His teachers were so shocked at his progress they cried during
the PTA meeting," the grandfather said. "But then his father got into
trouble, and the boy gave up again."</TE>
<TE>   The wang ba became his refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the boys remain under police detention, pending further
investigation and possibly a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Entrepreneurs say that if Beijing seizes on the wang ba fire to
toughen regulations overall, it could deal a serious blow to
legitimate cyber cafes--which already are weak competitors of the
illegal operators, partly because they tend to be nicer, safer and
more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Without good and simple regulations that distinguish between good
and bad Internet cafes, it's very hard for entrepreneurs to invest in
the business," said Edward Zeng, the self-proclaimed founder of
China's first upscale Internet cafe in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   His cafes actually serve coffee and turn away minors, but he said
he's paying a price for following the law. In the last two years,
poor business has forced him to cut his chain of about 20 shops by
half, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 10% of Beijing's estimated 2,200 Internet cafes are
legitimate, because the state makes obtaining licenses very
difficult. Illegal operators thrive--they give young Web users what
they want: 24-hour service for as little as 25 cents an hour,
cigarettes, even cots to crash on. This makes for cheap
entertainment, even in China. Youngsters in school uniforms are the
illicit cafes' main clientele.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese press is splattered with horror stories about the
tragic consequences.</TE>
<TE>   A high school sophomore came home late from a wang ba and
confronted his angry father, according to one account. Then the
teenager leaped from the family's seventh-floor window.</TE>
<TE>   One middle school student had been playing for so long that he
insisted he was being abducted by aliens. His parents sent him to a
mental hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Parents have tried begging and grounding. Some have cut their
children's allowance. No matter--the kids borrowed, stole, sold their
bicycles. Anything to keep playing.</TE>
<TE>   Some desperate parents have hired private detectives to hunt down
children who go missing for days. Others have formed neighborhood
brigades to patrol local haunts.</TE>
<TE>   But the games go on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way to kill time and fill emptiness," said Liang,
the chemistry major. "Most of us can't afford to travel or do other
things for fun. I don't know about the girls, but for the guys, it's
our No. 1 recreational activity."</TE>
<TE>   When the girls turn up, they tend to stay in a separate part of
the room reading e-mail and chatting online. Many drown out the noise
from the game-crazed boys by downloading pop songs and listening to
them on headphones.</TE>
<TE>   Liang said he likes to play as many as seven hours a day straight,
and Saturdays are usually all-nighters. On the night of the fire, he
was playing at a nearby wang ba when the blaze illuminated the sky.</TE>
<TE>   The two alleged arsonists apparently bickered with the owners
because they had no money to play. So the boys torched the place with
gasoline, according to their confession.</TE>
<TE>   Those who died were trapped on the second floor of the building.
The only exit was engulfed in flames--or perhaps locked from the
outside. The windows were bolted with steel bars, a common practice
for owners afraid of inspectors and computer theft.</TE>
<TE>   Bouquets of yellow chrysanthemums appeared last week on the curb
next to the gutted building. Reading the messages of grief left most
parents shaken and determined.</TE>
<TE>   Zo Jianjune, the mother of a 21-year-old son who lives next door
to the burned cafe, said her husband had run to the wang ba, unbolted
the steel bars and saved seven people.</TE>
<TE>   "A crackdown is absolutely necessary," she said. "Otherwise,
there's no telling what else could happen."</TE>

<HD>Hometown Pride Turns to Bitterness</HD>
<DH>Scandal: WorldCom and its folksy founder won over Clinton,
Miss. Now disillusionment sets in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLINTON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>Wyatt Waters never owned a scrap of WorldCom Inc. stock or set foot
in its hulking headquarters with the big black gate and big black
windows a mile down the road.</LD>
<LD>   He was unimpressed at first when the telecommunications giant
relocated to his little town, saying the only thing Clinton got out
of it was a firetruck with a ladder. But like so many others in
Mississippi, Waters, a watercolor artist, became a believer.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom turned into the state's Cinderella story, a home-grown
venture born on the back of a napkin that grew to knock out corporate
heavyweights and become Mississippi's first--and only--Fortune 500
company.</LD>
<TE>   "We were rooting for WorldCom because it made us all look good,"
Waters said Thursday as he reached for a homemade pickle in his
downtown gallery. "Now, I guess, we feel let down."</TE>
<TE>   As details emerge of a massive accounting scandal at the nation's
No. 2 long-distance provider and WorldCom's stock price searches for
zero, Mississippians brace for hundreds of job cuts and something
even harder to swallow: lost pride.</TE>
<TE>   Its founder, Bernard J. Ebbers, had been lionized as a Ted
Turner-like hero, an irreverent executive known for daring mergers,
cowboy boots and shooting the breeze at local truck stops.</TE>
<TE>   Folks in Clinton, a suburb of Jackson, used to look forward to
seeing the tall, bearded man--once worth a billion dollars--chatting
under the oaks at the local college, stooping beneath the striped
awnings of the postcard downtown and teaching Bible class on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's a certain bitterness. Especially among shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us held on to the stock because we believed in Bernie,"
said Margie Smith, a longtime investor and Jackson-area resident.</TE>
<TE>   And that's just it. Mississippi is not crammed with rich people or
stockbroker types. For many investors, WorldCom felt safe because
they had mingled with the executives running it. Ebbers, who lives in
nearby Brookhaven, has declined interviews. He resigned as chief
executive in April after it was disclosed that he owed WorldCom more
than $400 million for loans he took to cover bad stock bets.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton and WorldCom might seem an incongruous pair. WorldCom was
one of the top-performing stocks of the 1990s, going from 81 cents to
$64. Mississippi remains one of the poorest states: 49th in household
income, 49th in money spent on education and 50th in homes with
phones.</TE>
<TE>   It was a basketball scholarship that brought the 6-foot-4-inch,
Canadian-born Ebbers to Mississippi College, a small Baptist school
in Clinton, in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   After completing school, he became a coach. Then, in 1983, at a
coffee shop in Hattiesburg, about 100 miles southeast of Jackson,
Ebbers and three friends hatched an idea for a long-distance phone
company.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers jotted details down on a napkin. According to local lore,
the name, Long Distance Discount Service, was supplied by a waitress.</TE>
<TE>   The company moved to Jackson a few years later. As it grew, so did
the area's commercial profile.</TE>
<TE>   "He put us on the map," said Jehu Brabham, a Clinton alderman. "I
don't think there's any doubt that the success of WorldCom helped us
attract important industries, like the new Nissan plant."</TE>
<TE>   Many people are hoping the plant, opening next year near Jackson
and expected eventually to employ 5,300 people, will soak up some of
the jobs shed from WorldCom, which announced this week that it would
slash 17,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Ebbers moved the WorldCom headquarters from Jackson to
Clinton. The bedroom community of 23,000 is part small town, part
homogenized suburb, with strip malls and an interstate slicing
through it. The impressive WorldCom headquarters sits behind a Pizza
Hut.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers contributed generously to the community, donating millions
to Mississippi College and shoring up local art museums.</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, he was worth $1.3 billion. He was the richest man
Mississippi had ever known.</TE>
<TE>   But the empire began to crumble in July 2000, when a proposed
giant merger with Sprint failed. WorldCom is the most widely held
stock here, said financial advisor Arthur Finkelberg. And many local
investors had become so attached that despite a sinking share price
and clear warning signs, they held on.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought Wall Street was picking on Mississippi," said Clinton
shopkeeper Lyda Gilmore.</TE>
<TE>   When Ebbers resigned, it was clear the company was in trouble. Now
most people accept the possibility WorldCom could disappear.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't kill the local economy," said Sherry Vance of the
Mississippi Development Authority, the state's economic development
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton is not a one-horse town, and the Baptist college, a car
parts factory and the Nissan plant will be healthy employers, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Waters, whose paintings favor sherbet-tinted sunsets, said the
presence of WorldCom didn't spur the rapid development many in
Clinton had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "This place looks exactly the same," he said, looking out his
gallery windows at the copper lampposts and quiet cobblestone
streets.</TE>
<TE>   At WorldCom headquarters Thursday, the death dance had begun. News
crews stuck cameras between the bars of the black fence, trying to
grab a shot of the four-story building. About 1,700 people work here,
substantially fewer than at WorldCom's other major offices in Dallas,
Tulsa, Okla., and Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   One Clinton resident showed up with two children and a camera.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want them to lose faith in corporate America," he said,
then snapped a photo and drove away.</TE>
<TE>   During the lunchtime rush at Hudgey's, a packed diner, there were
no WorldCom employees to be found.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when all those folks would come strutting in here
thinking they were hot stuff, their name tags sticking out on their
chests," said tile setter Justin Burgess. "I guess I shouldn't say
this, but where are they now?"</TE>

<HD>Congress Subpoenas 4 in WorldCom Scandal</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Pension funds tell of losses exceeding $1
billion on investments in company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER, ALEX PHAM and JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two congressional committees opened broad investigations Thursday
into the accounting practices at WorldCom Inc. as the company was
taking the first steps to save itself from collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The House Financial Services Committee subpoenaed three key
company executives and an influential Wall Street analyst who touted
its stock. In addition, the House Energy and Commerce
Committee--which has been investigating other major financial
scandals--asked WorldCom to turn over a long list of documents by
July 11, including internal audits and minutes of board meetings
relating to accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   The toll of the WorldCom scandal began to unfold as pension funds
for millions of state employees disclosed that they lost more than $1
billion on stock and bond investments in the nation's second-largest
long-distance company. California and New York funds lost $565
million and $300 million, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom, meanwhile, hired investment banking firm Goldman Sachs
to help sell some of its assets, including part of its South American
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Ordered to testify before Congress on July 8 were John W.
Sidgmore, who became chief executive of WorldCom eight weeks ago;
founder and ousted Chairman Bernard J. Ebbers; and Scott D. Sullivan,
who was fired Tuesday as chief financial officer. Also subpoenaed was
Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman, a longtime supporter of
WorldCom who did not downgrade the stock until March--after it had
fallen nearly 90% from its 1999 peak.</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications giant, parent company of MCI, revealed late
Tuesday that it improperly accounted for $3.9 billion in expenses in
2001 and the first quarter of 2002, a move that covered up about $1.2
billion in losses.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, once the highest-paid industry researcher on Wall Street,
has been tied to another recent telecom meltdown: He was an advisor
to Global Crossing Ltd. Chairman Gary Winnick and was involved in
negotiations over corporate acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   None of those subpoenaed could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators probably will want to know who
authorized WorldCom's accounting procedures, which other top officers
knew about the practices and when they knew, said Harold
Furchtgott-Roth, a former member of the Federal Communications
Commission and onetime aide on the Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just such a large amount of money that it's hard to believe
that a lot of people didn't know about it, including outside stock
analysts," Furchtgott-Roth said.</TE>
<TE>   One key issue is whether the members of the audit committee of
WorldCom's board of directors could have known--or failed to ask the
right questions. WorldCom's regulatory filings state that the
committee is responsible for "oversight responsibilities" and
"reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with
management."</TE>
<TE>   Although the committee members do not assure that the auditing of
financial statements has been carried out in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards, the members could have insight
into specifics of WorldCom's alleged accounting fraud, legal experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing should go on that the audit committee is not aware of,"
said former U.S. Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher. "If the
chief financial officer is going to lie to you, that's one thing. If
you're on the audit committee and you never ask questions about
changes in accounting, then you haven't performed your duty."</TE>
<TE>   As of April 22, the committee comprised four outside directors:
Judith Areen, dean of the Law Center at Georgetown University; James
C. Allen, an investment director and general partner of Meritage
Private Equity Fund in Denver; Max E. Bobbitt, a telecommunications
consultant and director of Verso Technologies Inc. in Atlanta; and
Francesco Galesi, who runs a conglomerate of real estate,
telecommunications and oil and gas companies.</TE>
<TE>   None of the directors returned calls for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts said the scale of the alleged fraud at WorldCom
indicated that more than one executive at the telecommunications firm
was aware of the accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   "With WorldCom, there's no way only one person--say only the chief
financial officer--was involved in this. Other people had to know,"
Bowsher said. "You can't just misplace $3.8 billion and not have
someone ask questions."</TE>
<TE>   Two other federal agencies also are examining WorldCom's
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil
fraud suit against WorldCom that, among other things, seeks to
prevent the company from destroying documents and paying lucrative
severance packages to executives. The SEC also demanded--before the
stock markets open Monday--a complete report detailing the company's
accounting irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Justice Department, which can bring criminal
charges against a company and its executives, is looking into the
matter, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In moving to sell assets, WorldCom is hoping to pare some of its
$30 billion in debt and bolster the $4 billion in cash it has on
hand. Company executives said repeatedly, before Tuesday's
disclosure, that they had no intention of filing for bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said it was difficult to estimate the value of
WorldCom's assets, which include extensive long-distance capacity and
local networks for corporate customers in many cities. Part of the
difficulty, aside from the company's now-unclear finances, is that
WorldCom's network cannot easily be broken off in pieces and sold.
Rather, the assets are tightly integrated.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ability to value that is compromised by the fact that the
financials just blew up on us," said Adam Quinton, telecommunications
analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., during a conference call Wednesday
with clients. "The identifiable assets that can be separated are
limited, and there's a complete lack of tangible substance on the
core business."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the assets may be of little value because of an
industrywide glut, said David Passmore, research director for Burton
Group, a network analysis firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing the other carriers need right now is more
capacity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's most valuable asset, analysts said, is its customer
base.</TE>
<TE>   "While it's great that WorldCom has this network, the bottom line
is: How much revenue are they generating from it? How many customers
use it?" said Ron Banaszek, director of TFS Telecom, a Swiss
consulting and investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in WorldCom shares was suspended for a second straight
day.</TE>
<TE>   As news of WorldCom's troubles spreads, its rivals stand to gain.</TE>
<TE>   "Sprint and AT&amp;T are going to be the primary beneficiaries," said
Donald Carros, a senior telecommunications analyst at the Meta Group
Inc. in Stamford, Conn. "Next will be Verizon, SBC and Bell South."</TE>
<TE>   SBC said the number of calls it received from potential new
customers jumped 25% in the last three days as the WorldCom news
unspooled. AT&amp;T and Sprint also said they saw increases in calls from
potential customers.</TE>
<TE>   Carros, who advises large companies on their communications
networks, said he was telling clients that use WorldCom to move their
crucial communications to a more financially stable carrier.</TE>
<TE>   The future also looks grim for the 17,000 WorldCom employees who
stand to lose their jobs. With much of the telecommunications
industry in financial straits, few companies are hiring. Instead,
most have gone through painful cutbacks, eliminating 400,000 jobs in
the last two years.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELK GROVE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>With as much pomp and circumstance as can be mustered at a
sixth-grade graduation, the children strode into the gym. The
youngster in the Fat Albert shirt smiled as proudly as the girl in
the Mary Janes. Parents bent their necks like flamingos for the
perfect snapshot.</LD>
<LD>   And then, suddenly and spontaneously, as the crowd stood for the
Pledge of Allegiance, a little slice of Americana turned into a big
slab of patriotism.</LD>
<LD>   "I pledge allegiance to the flag," the crowd at Morse Elementary
School began, quietly at first. "And to the republic, for which it
stands, one nation, UNDER GOD!"</LD>
<TE>   They screamed it. It used to be a throwaway line, mumbled by
generations of children while trying to remember how to pronounce
"indivisible." Now, in this Sacramento suburb and across California,
those are fighting words.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a day after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declared
the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because of the reference to
God, the judge who wrote the ruling put his own decision on hold
while school officials prepare an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   That did little to appease Californians, who were quickly caught
up--some by directing epithets at the father who brought the lawsuit,
others by quietly placing their hands over their hearts--in what they
view as a constitutional crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're seeing here is disbelief," said Dave Schutz, 36, a
locksmith who came to Morse School to watch his middle child,
Stephanie, graduate to seventh grade. "This is what we built this
country on. And I don't see how one guy, one court or one judge, can
make a decision for everybody else. The majority of society believes
in a greater being, and the majority of us look to that greater being
to protect us and look over us."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's graduation ceremony crowd of about 300 was diverse.
Latinos sat next to African Americans, whites next to Asian
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many agreed that the court decision seemed another affront
to pride and innocence--no different, they said, from when schools
began curbing their emphasis on Christmas during the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   "What's next?" asked Sonya Wynne, 36, a Sacramento-area interior
decorator watching her 12-year-old niece graduate. "First they took
prayer out of school. You can't have Christmas plays anymore. Now we
can't let God be in anything. That's why we said the 'God' part so
loud just now. It has become a very personal issue here."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Elk Grove Unified School District, south of
Sacramento, where the lawsuit that forced Wednesday's court decision
was filed, declared that they will fight the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. David W. Gordon said he and his attorneys have not decided
whether to ask for a rehearing in front of the 9th Circuit or ask to
take the case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. School district
leaders said California government attorneys and the U.S. Justice
Department have offered their assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "We will fight this ... as long as it takes," Gordon said at a
news conference in the Morse School library.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento-area resident Michael A. Newdow, a 49-year-old
physician by training who says he has put his career on hold to fight
the government, brought the lawsuit that led to Wednesday's decision.</TE>
<TE>   He said he does not want to outlaw the Pledge of Allegiance, but
merely to eliminate the words "under God"--which were not in the
original version, but were added during the Cold War by Congress and
President Eisenhower in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Newdow's 8-year-old daughter will wrap up her second-grade year at
nearby Florence Markofer Elementary School this week.</TE>
<TE>   Her father said the girl stands for the pledge each morning with
her classmates despite his beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   So far, classmates and friends are protecting the girl from being
ostracized because of the case, Gordon said, and her mother--Newdow's
former partner, who lives nearby--called the Markofer principal
Thursday morning to declare that the girl would attend.</TE>
<TE>   Newdow remained defiant and unrepentant Thursday, saying the angry
response that has swept the nation has not swayed him from his cause,
adding that there is "nothing more patriotic than fighting to uphold
the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's decision prompted scores of people to angrily call
Newdow's home. He said several threatened his life.</TE>
<TE>   Newdow, an atheist, said that the people who left profane messages
were those "with God on their side" and that he would urge the
callers to "try to understand what this case is all about."</TE>
<TE>   "They appear to think this is about denying them the opportunity
to worship as they choose," he said. "And it's quite to the
contrary."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento police officers stopped by his home Thursday to talk
about the threats, and pledged to drive by regularly to ensure his
safety.</TE>
<TE>   School officials were quick to condemn the callers Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our democracy is very strong because we allow for dissent,"
Gordon said. "Mr. Newdow is challenging this law as he has a right to
do.... We're fighting in court--not on the streets, as goes on in so
many other countries."</TE>
<TE>   That message hasn't gotten through to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's an idiot," said Schutz, the locksmith.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the vitriol, however, school officials, parents and
students across California were suddenly forced to confront some very
real legal decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Brian D. Myers, for example, an Elk Grove school board member and
a deputy district attorney in Sacramento County, made what has become
a common argument: that the pledge is a general reference to faith.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pledge to faith, as opposed to an individual's particular
deity," he said. "This just seems to be a very narrow interpretation
of the words 'under God.' Is Allah God? Yes.... So why can't this
stand for all Gods?"</TE>
<TE>   But what about people who don't believe in any God?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know the answer to that," Myers said. "That's a hard
one."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon noted proudly that the Board of Education chooses a
hard-working parent or school volunteer to lead the board in the
Pledge of Allegiance to begin each of its meetings. Would the board
give the honors to a parent who did not want to say the words "under
God?"</TE>
<TE>   As school board members, standing behind Gordon and out of his
line of sight, nodded quickly in affirmation, Gordon said they would
not.</TE>
<TE>   "The pledge is the pledge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That was a mantra repeated Thursday across California.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. William J. "Pete" Knight (R-Palmdale) called the court
ruling ridiculous and said he would forge ahead stronger than ever
with his efforts to pass a bill requiring schools to recite the
pledge each day.</TE>
<TE>   But some educators agree with the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County schools Supt. Charles Weis said it makes sense in a
multicultural world.</TE>
<TE>   "Saying the pledge reminds us of what this country stands for," he
said. Removing the words "under God," he said, "enables everyone to
demonstrate their patriotism, regardless of their religious beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Stell, a teacher at Grant High School in Van Nuys, where the
pledge is said during every home room period, welcomed the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Stell said he tells his students that they can abstain from saying
the pledge. About a third decline to participate. "It shouldn't be
forced on students," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, teachers, parents and students were swept
up in the wave of anger and patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a deflated balloon. They just let out my pride," said
Joseph Santana, principal of John Adams Middle School in Los Angeles.
"What do we have left if we cannot have respect for our country and
demonstrate it outwardly?"</TE>

<HD>Student Drug Test Law Valid</HD>
<DH>Courts: Justices say such screens are a 'safety and health'
issue and not an invasion of privacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>School officials can require students who participate in
extracurricular activities to undergo regular or random drug tests,
even if there is no evidence of a drug problem at the school, the
Supreme Court ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-4 decision calls school drug tests a "safety and health"
measure that protects students, not an invasion of their privacy.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's ruling clears the way for school boards across the
nation to adopt drug testing policies in their secondary schools.</LD>
<TE>   But few did so after the high court upheld drug testing of student
athletes in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of school districts in California have considered
regular urine screening of students. And some who have debated the
idea backed away after parents and students voiced opposition.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court justices have shown support and enthusiasm
for drug testing and have upheld nearly every testing plan that has
come before them. One major exception was a novel Georgia law that
required candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to submit to
drug tests.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling Thursday upheld a policy adopted by the school board in
Tecumseh, Okla. In 1998, the school board president said she had been
concerned about drug use since seeing students smoking marijuana in
the 1970s. The board's new policy said students in the band, the
choir, cheerleaders and members of groups such as the Future Farmers
of America and the Academic Team must consent to regular drug tests.</TE>
<TE>   The tests are designed to check only for illegal drugs, such as
marijuana or cocaine, but not alcohol. Those who test positive are
required to meet with school officials. The results are not turned
over to the police.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two years, 505 students were tested. Three of them,
all athletes, tested positive.</TE>
<TE>   The policy was challenged by high school student Lindsay Earls, a
self-described "goodie two-shoes" who was a member of the choir and
the National Honor Society. She took a urine test that was negative,
but she and her parents said the policy was humiliating, useless and
an invasion of privacy. She is now a student at Dartmouth College.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawsuit contended the mandatory testing violated the 4th
Amendment's ban on "unreasonable searches" by the government. The
U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver agreed and ruled that school
officials need evidence of an "identifiable drug abuse problem" in
the school before imposing mandatory testing.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court reversed that ruling Thursday in the case of
Board of Education vs. Earls, 01-322.</TE>
<TE>   Like Thursday's ruling upholding the use of vouchers for religious
schools, the drug-testing decision removes a constitutional barrier
for school officials. They may choose to adopt a drug testing plan,
but they need not do so.</TE>
<TE>   And while the 5-4 vote ratio was the same in both decisions, there
was one difference. This time, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a Clinton
appointee, joined the conservative majority, while Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, a Reagan appointee, voted with the liberals to strike down
the drug testing policy.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1980s, the more liberal court had said the government
needed evidence that someone had done something wrong before it could
subject a person to a search. But since drug testing first won
approval in 1989, the court has said public officials only need to
have sufficient reason to impose a testing requirement on a large
number of presumably innocent people.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Clarence Thomas said students are "entrusted" to the care
of school officials, who have a duty to keep them safe and healthy.
Moreover, students have a minimal "expectation of privacy" at school,
he said, since they are subjected to physical exams and given
vaccinations. And since the results are not turned over to the
police, the drug tests need not meet the 4th Amendment's standards
governing criminal searches, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We find that testing students who participate in extracurricular
activities is a reasonably effective means of addressing the school
district's legitimate concerns in preventing, deterring and detecting
drug use," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Breyer agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer has been a surprisingly strong supporter of the police and
school officials in drug cases. He cast one of two dissents when the
court said police cannot routinely pick up the personal baggage of
travelers and feel for drugs. He also joined the majority in
upholding the drug testing of school athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Drugs are "a serious national problem," and school officials can
adopt reasonable testing requirements to cope with the problem,
Breyer said in a concurring opinion.</TE>
<TE>   However, he added that he might not go along if the school
officials decided to "subject the entire school to testing."</TE>
<TE>   Graham Boyd, the lawyer who represented Earls, called the ruling
disappointing and probably counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   "Every available study demonstrates that the single best way to
prevent drug use among students is to engage them in extracurricular
activities," said Boyd, who also heads the American Civil Liberties
Union drug policy litigation project, which is seeking to overhaul
the nation's drug laws.</TE>
<TE>   He said the decision also sounds an ominous note.</TE>
<TE>   "If drug testing now becomes a rite of passage for an entire
generation of students, the door will be cracked open wider to the
government's inevitable demand for DNA, medical records, financial
information and personal data," Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Earls said, "I'm really sad that every other
schoolkid in America might have to go through a humiliating urine
test like I did just to join the choir or the debate team."</TE>

<HD>School Vouchers Win Backing of High Court</HD>
<DH>Law: The 5-4 ruling allows use of taxpayer money to send
students to parochial campuses. It's a major victory for 'choice'
movement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court opened the door Thursday for the use of taxpayer
money to send students to church schools, ruling that Ohio's voucher
plan does not violate the Constitution's ban on an ''establishment of
religion.''</LD>
<LD>   The 5-4 decision, coming on the last day of this year's term, is a
major victory for the ''school choice'' movement and probably the
most important high court ruling on aid to parochial schools in
nearly 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling upholds Ohio's tuition grant of $2,250 that families in
Cleveland can spend at private schools. More than 96% of parents who
took the money enrolled their children in religious schools.</LD>
<TE>   Both sides in the debate predict that the ruling will trigger a
push for vouchers and other forms of school choice around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the state aid program was
designed to help low-income children, not to promote religion.
Moreover, the flow of money depends on ''true private choice,'' he
said.</TE>
<TE>   ''No reasonable observer would think a neutral program of private
choice, where state aid reaches religious schools solely as a result
of numerous independent decisions of private individuals, carries
with it the imprimatur of government endorsement,'' the chief justice
said.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill praised the
ruling and said it will give parents more choices for their
children's education.</TE>
<TE>   ''This decision clears the way for other innovative school choice
programs so that no child in America will be left behind,'' Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   ''Today's historic Supreme Court decision ... can transform the
education landscape in our country,'' added Education Secretary Rod
Paige. It ''lifts the constitutional cloud that has been hanging over
school choice programs for years and will open the doors of
opportunity to thousands of children who need and deserve the best
possible education.''</TE>
<TE>   The ''school choice'' advocates, most of whom are critics of the
public schools, say parents, especially those in big cities, need
more options for their children. Among the most attractive and
available options are the Roman Catholic schools. Many of them have
open seats and charge low tuition.</TE>
<TE>   But until now, many state officials have hesitated to propose
using public funds to send children to these schools because of the
legal barrier separating church and state.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, only Milwaukee and Cleveland offer parents vouchers,
but Republican governors in several states have expressed interest in
the idea. In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush has created a small voucher
program that is targeted at children who attend ''failing'' public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the last decade, California's voters, by 2-1 margins,
rejected voucher proposals on the state ballot. Two years ago, 71% of
voters opposed the idea of authorizing a $4,000 annual state subsidy
per child to pay for private schools. Vouchers have also lost in
statewide votes in Washington, Michigan and Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   In opinion polls, suburban voter in those states say they were
reasonably satisfied with the public schools and opposed spending
millions of dollars in tax funds for private schools.</TE>
<TE>   For the Supreme Court, Thursday's ruling culminates the long but
steady shift away from the doctrine of separation of church and
state.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, a unanimous court quoted Thomas Jefferson and said the
1st Amendment creates a ''wall of separation between church and
state.'' That means, Justice Hugo Black said, that ''no tax in any
amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious
activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever
form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.''</TE>
<TE>   This stood as the law for decades. In 1973, the court struck down
a New York law, similar to Ohio's, that gave tuition subsidies to
parents who sent their children to parochial schools.</TE>
<TE>   But since Rehnquist became chief justice in the mid-1980s, the
court has moved away from the strict separation of church and state.
On several occasions, it has upheld a limited use of public money in
parochial schools.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the court two years ago approved the use of federal
funds to buy computers in both public and parochial schools. The
justices also said public reading tutors can work in parochial
schools to help disadvantaged children.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling goes a step further because it upholds the use
of tax money to pay for a child to leave a public school and enroll
in a parochial school.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist's opinion did not officially overturn the 1973 ruling,
but he made clear that voucher plans can stand so long as they offer
parents an array of choices. In Cleveland, they can choose a public
magnet school or a community school, or use the voucher money for a
private or parochial school.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have never found a program of true private choice to offend
the establishment clause,'' he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist's opinion does not say a voucher program must be
targeted at low-income children or limited in scope. The ruling
appears to clear the way for a statewide voucher program that offers
tuition subsidies to all families with schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The parochial aid issue split the court along the familiar
conservative-liberal lines. Rehnquist's opinion was joined in full by
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   In a concurring opinion, O'Connor stressed that Ohio does not send
public money directly to Catholic schools. It sends vouchers to
parents, she noted. Moreover, the voucher program in Cleveland is
small, she said--a mere $8.2 million. Consider that $45 billion in
federal funds went to religious hospitals in 1998, O'Connor said, yet
no one argues that this spending bridges the wall of separation
between church and state.</TE>
<TE>   In a powerful concurring opinion, Thomas invoked Frederick
Douglass, the black abolitionist, who said: ''Education means
emancipation. It means light and liberty.'' Thomas added, ''Today,
many of our inner-city public schools deny emancipation to urban
minority students.'' The 1st Amendment should not be read to
''constrain a state's neutral efforts to provide greater educational
opportunity for underprivileged minority students.''</TE>
<TE>   Ohio's state school Supt. Susan Zelman had appealed when a lower
court struck down the voucher plan in a lawsuit that was paid for by
the National Education Assn. but brought on behalf of a taxpayer
named Doris Simmons-Harris. So the case was known as Zelman vs.
Simmons-Harris, 00-1751.</TE>
<TE>   Justice David H. Souter, speaking for the four dissenters, called
the ruling a ''dramatic departure'' from the core principle in the
''establishment clause''--that the government may not spend tax funds
for the teaching of religion. He was joined by Justices John Paul
Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   In separate dissents, Stevens and Breyer also worried about the
prospect of ''religious strife'' if Roman Catholic, Protestant,
Jewish and Muslim groups compete for government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the public schools and the two major teachers'
unions--the American Federation of Teachers and the NEA--denounced
the ruling and said a voucher plan will drain money from the public
schools to benefit the few who go to private schools.</TE>
<TE>   ''Just because vouchers may be legal in some circumstances doesn't
make them a good idea,'' said NEA President Bob Chase.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, said the Rehnquist opinion takes a
''wrecking ball'' to the wall of separation between church and state.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is clearly the worst church-state decision in the past 50
years,'' Lynn said. ''Unfortunately, the court has approved forcing
taxpayers to pay for religious indoctrination. America, watch your
wallet or it may end up in the collection plate.''</TE>
<TE>   Besides allowing more public aid to parochial schools, Thursday's
ruling also represents a victory for President Bush's ''faith-based
initiative.''</TE>
<TE>   Bush wants government money to support and encourage church-based
programs that, among other things, offer counseling for drug abusers,
prisoners and pregnant teens.</TE>
